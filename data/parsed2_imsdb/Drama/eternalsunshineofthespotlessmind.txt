eternal sunshine of the spotless mind by charlie kaufman
its grand and modern
random house knopf taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters
an old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript maybe a thousand pages
she seems haunted hollow eyed sickly
the young receptionist dressed in a shiny stretchy one piece pantsuit looks up
apologetically hi i was in the neighborhood and thought id see i think hes in a conference
im really sorry
would you just try him
you never know
as long as im here
you never know
please have a seat
the old woman smiles and sits the bulky manuscript on her lap
she stares politely straight ahead
quietly into headset its her i know but couldnt you just yes i know but i know but shes old and it would be a nice yes sorry
to old woman im sorry maam hes not in right now
its a crazy time of year for us
the receptionist gestures toward a christmas tree in the corner
its ornaments are holograms
this book its essential that people read it because gravely patting the manuscript its the truth
and only i know it
nodding sympathetically maybe after the holidays then
the old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall
she stops to catch her breath then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them
when she arrives at one topped by an ll she slips a card in a slot
a plastic molded chair drops into the archway
she sits in the chair it rises
the woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube
the other chairs are peopled with commuters
we stay with the woman as she and the others travel over new york city in the tube
there are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline
the woman glances at the manuscript in her lap
its called eternal sunshine of the spotless mind this serves as the movies opening title
the other credits follow as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes
their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank
every doctors office waiting room chairs against the wall magazines on end tables a sad looking potted plant generic seascape paintings on the walls
the receptionist mary can be seen typing in the reception area
behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files
the door opens and clementine enters
shes in her early thirties zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt
shes decidedly funky and has blue hair
mary looks up
may i help you
approaching reception area yeah hi i have a one oclock with dr
yes please have a seat
hell be right with you
she looks tired maybe hungover
she picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest
mary pads down the hallway
she knocks on a closed door
mary opens the door peeks in
howard mierzwiak s professional dry sits behind his desk studying some papers
howard your one oclock
not looking up thanks mary
you can bring her in
she smiles and nods
its clear shes in love
its equally clear that mierzwiak doesnt have a clue
mary turns to leave
looking up mary
turning back yes
order me a pastrami for after
cole slaw ice tea
she smiles and heads down the hall
stan s tall spindly and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway
she glances back nervously at mierzwiaks open door
barely seen you all morning kiddo
he leans in to kiss her
she cranes her neck to keep him off
reprimanding whisper stan
i just somewhat guiltilly its just
anyway anyway ive got to do my tap dance here
she indicates the door to the reception area
see you later alligator
hey if youre ordering lunch for mierzwiak would you i better do this stan
stan nods again and mary opens the door to the waiting room
after a moment clementine appears in the doorway
mary leads her down the hall not looking back
professionally courteous how are you today
okay i guess
at mierzwiaks office here we are
mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk
kruczynski please come in
clementine enters the office
mary smiles at mierzwiak and closes the door leaving them alone
mierzwiak directs clementine to a chair next to a coffee table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues
mierzwiak sits across from her
how are you today
okay i guess
nodding sympathetically well why dont you tell me whats going on
do you mind if i turn this on
he indicates a tape recorder
i dont care
he turns it on smiles at her gestures for her to begin
well ive been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend i guess
you guess hes your boyfriend
or you guess youre having a bad time with hm
i dont like the term boyfriend
its so gay
hes attentive pleasant and neutral throughout
maybe gay isnt the right word
but anyway its been rough with him
whatever the fuck he is
my significant other
and i guess on a certain level i want to break it off but i feel
its like this constant questioning and re questioning
do i end it
should i give it more time
im not happy but what do i expect
relationships require work
you know the drill
the thing that i keep coming back to is im not getting any younger i want to have a baby
at some point
so then i think i should settle which is not necessarily the best word i mean hes a good guy
its not really settling
then i think maybe im just a victim of movies yknow
that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be
but then i think no this is what i really want so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it
but then i think he is a good guy and
i think i know
i think we can help
why dont you start by telling me about your relationship
everything you can think of
everything about him
everything about you
and well take it from there
she nods thinks
um well hes a fucking tidy one the platform is crowded with business commuters
joel is among them
he is in his s gaunt and holding a briefcase
the platform across the tracks from him is empty
suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd
he climbs the stairs crosses the overpass to the empty platform
soon an almost empty train pulls up to that platform
joel gets on and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station
joel talks on a phone
the wind howls around him
he tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks
listen im not feeling well this morning
food poisoning i think
sorry it took me so long to call in but ive been vomiting
joel wanders the windy empty beach with his briefcase
he passes an old man with a metal detector
they nod at each other
later joel looks out at the ocean
later joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook
he opens it and writes with a gloved hand
today i skipped work and took the train out to montauk
thinks its cold
thinks some more the sky is gray
thinks some more i dont know what else to say
i saw naomi last night
we had sex
it was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily
like no time has passed
after two years apart suddenly were talking about getting together again
i guess thats good
he has no other thoughts
he glances up spots a female figure in the distance walking in his direction
she stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt
he watches her for a bit then as she nears he goes back to his writing or at least pretends to
once she passed he watches her walk away
she stops and stares out at the ocean
if im constitutionally incapable of making eye contact with a woman i dont know
i guess id better get back to naomi
later joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season
he peeks cautiously in a dark window
later joel digs into the sand with a stick
its a local tourist place but off season empty
joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup
an elderly couple drink coffee at the counter
clementine enters looks around takes off her hood
joel glances at her bright blue hair
she picks an empty booth and sits
joel studies her discreetly
the waitress approaches her with a coffee pot
youve saved my life
the waitress pours the coffee
you know what you want yet
laughing aint that the question of the century
the waitress is not amused
you got grilled cheese and tomato soup
were having a run on it
the waitress heads to the grill
clementine fishes in her bag brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment pours something in then brings the cup back up
calling and some cream please
clementine looks around the place
her eyes meet joels before he is able to look away
she smiles vaguely
he looks embarrassed then down at his journal
clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read
joel glances up tries to see the cover
he cant read the title
joel stares out at the ocean
far down the beach clementine stares at it too
joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean
joel sits on the bench waiting for a train
clementine enters the platform sees joel the only other person there
she waves sort of goofily enthusiastic playing as if theyre old friends
he waves back embarrassed
she takes a seat on a bench far down the platform
joel stares at his hands pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness
joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain
after a moment the door between cars opens and clementine enters
joel looks up
clementine is not looking at him she busies herself deciding where to sit
she settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car
joel looks out the window
he feels her watching him
the train is picking up speed
finally calling over the rumble hi
joel looks over
why are you sorry
i just said hi
no i didnt know if you were talking to me so
she looks around the empty car
embarrassed well i didnt want to assume
aw cmon live dangerously
take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car
clementine makes her way down the aisle towards joel
its okay if i sit closer
so i dont have to scream
not that i dont need to scream sometimes believe me
pause but i dont want to bug you if youre trying to write or something
no i mean i dont know
i cant really think of much to say probably
she hesitates in the middle of the car looks back where she came from
i mean its okay if you want to sit down here
i didnt mean to no i dont want to bug you if youre trying to its okay really
just you know to chat a little maybe
i have a long trip ahead of me
sits across aisle from joel how far are you going
on the train i mean of course
what are the odds
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you
i thought that earlier in the diner
thats why i was looking at you
you work at borders right
bizarre small world huh
yeah thats me book slave there for like five years now
because jesus is it five years
i gotta quit right now
because i go there all the time
i dont think i ever saw you before
well im there
i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible
you have a cell phone
i need to quit right this minute
ill call in dead
i dont have one
ill go on the dole
like my daddy before me
i noticed your hair
i guess it made an impression on me thats why i was pretty sure i recognized you
ah the hair
pulls a strand in front of her eyes studies it blue right
its called blue ruin
snappy name huh
i like it
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering
tom waits says it in exactly
i cant remember
anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names
red menace yellow fever green revolution
thatd be a job coming up with those names
how do you get a job like that
thats what ill do
fuck the dole
i dont really know how purple haze pink eraser
you think that could possibly be a full time job
how many hair colors could there be
pissy someones got that job
excited agent orange
i came up with that one
anyway there are endless color possibilities and id be great at it
im sure you would
my writing career
your hair written by clementine kruczynski
thought the tom waits album is rain dogs
that doesnt sound i think
anyway ive tried all their colors
more than once
im getting too old for this
but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality
i apply my personality in a paste
oh i doubt thats the case
well you dont know me so
you dont know do you
i was just trying to be nice
yeah i got it
theres a silence
my names clementine by the way
no jokes about my name
oh you wouldnt do that youre trying to be nice
i dont know any jokes about your name
i dont know what that means
what are you nuts
im nut nuts
singing oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin clementine
its a pretty name though
it means merciful right
although it hardly fits
im a vindictive little bitch truth be told
see i wouldnt think that about you
pissy why wouldnt you think that about me
i dont know
i was just
i dont know
you seemed nice so now im nice
dont you know any other adjectives
theres careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative
they sit in silence for a while
i just dont think nice is a particularly interesting thing to be
the conductor enters the car
joel hands the conductor his ticket
the conductor punches it and hands it back
what is nice anyway
i mean besides an adjective
i guess it can be an adverb sort of
the conductor turns to clementine
she fishes in her bag
it doesnt reveal anything
nice is pandering
and life is more interesting than that
or should be
jesus god i hope it is
to conductor i know its here
the conductor and joel watch as she gets more agitated
i dont need nice
i dont need myself to be it and i dont need anyone else to be it at me
i know its here
she dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through
joel sees the book she was reading in the diner
its the play by stephen dixon
there it is oh
she hands the conductor the tickets smiles sweetly
he punches it hands it back to her and walks away
next stop southampton
the conductor heads into the next car
clementine shoves stuff back into her purse
her hands are a little shaky
she pulls a airline sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket opens it and downs it
joel is watching all of this but pretending not to
she looks out the window for a while
the train pulls into the station
the doors open
nobody gets on
the doors close
the train pulls out
its joel right
im sorry i
yelled at you
was it yelling
i cant really tell
whatever im a little out of sorts today
stares out window my embarrassing admission is i really like that youre nice
right now anyway
i cant tell from one moment to the next what im going to like
but right now im glad you said thats okay to me
that was nice of you
its no problem
anyway i have some stuff i need to oh okay
well sure ill just
stands throws bag over shoulder take care then
pulling journal from briefcase probably see you at the book store
heading toward other end of car unless i get that hair color naming job
clementine sits and stares out the window
there are a few more people in the car now
clementine has inched a few seats closer to joel
she watches him
his head is immersed in his journal
its dark out
the train is pretty crowded
joel stares out the window
clementine sits closer still to joel eyes him
the doors open and joel emerges along with others
he heads to the parking lot arrives at the car
theres a big dented scrape along the drivers side
he gets in
he passes clementine walking
she looks cold
he considers slows rolls down his window
i could give you a ride if you need
no thats okay
i dont want to take you out of your way
he pulls over
she climbs in
where do you live
youre not a stalker or anything right
well i probably wouldnt say if i were but no
you cant be too careful
ive been stalked
ive been told im highly stalkable
i dont need that
im not a stalker
beat you know wilmont
near the high school
they drive in silence
look im very sorry i came off sort of nutso
im not really
i didnt think you were
theres a silence
so you like bookstores huh
i like to read
it is rain dogs by the way
i cant remember that album very well
i remember liking it
but the songs th and hennepin
i spent most of the train ride trying to remember
till youre full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin and you spill out over the side to anyone wholl listen
sort of um
and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there and im lost in the window i hide on the stairway i hang in the curtain i
sleep in your hat
starts to cry oh shit
im so stupid
im just a bit of a wreck
i sleep in your hat makes me cry
pointing to a house me
joel pulls over
thanks very much
that was very nice of you
well i wouldnt want to be oh geez im full of shit
i already told you that
clementine opens the car door
turning back hey do you want to have a drink
i have lots of drinks
and i could um never mind
sorry that was stupid
good night joel
joel stands in the living room somewhat nervously
he tries to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings
he looks at the books on her shelves
clementine is in the kitchen
we see her as she passes by the doorway several times preparing drinks and chatting
i like it too
been here about four years
its really cheap
my downstairs neighbor is old so shes quiet which is great
and the landlords sweet which is bizarre but great and i have a little porch in the back which is great because i can read there and listen to my
clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics
two blue ruins
joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of crows flying
you like that
someone gave that to me just like recently
i like it too
i like crows
i think i used to be a crow
she caws and hands joel a drink
that was good that crow sound
do you believe in that stuff
i dont know
oh theres an inscription on the back
takes it off the wall reads the way a crow shook down on me the dust of snow from a hemlock tree has given my heart a change of mood
and saved some part of a day i rued
im not like a robert frost lover by any stretch
his stuff seems strictly grade school to me
but this made me cry for some reason
maybe because it is grade school
i miss grade school
i dont know why im calling it grade school all of a sudden
when i went we called it elementary school
but i like grade school better
sounds like something someone from the forties would call it
id like to be from then
everyone wore hats
they click glasses
clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink
she plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off
god that feels so fucking good
take yours off
well have a seat anyway
joel sits in a chair across the room
clementine finishes her drink
ready for another
no im okay for now
she heads toward the kitchen with her glass
well im ready
put some music on
joel crosses to the cds and studies them
what do you want to hear
you pick it
you just say
im not really i dont know
i cant see them from here joel
just pick something good
joel studies the unfamiliar cds
he picks up bang on a can performing brian enos music for airports to look at
clementine reenters with her drink
oh excellent choice
she grabs it and sticks it in the cd player
the music is dreamy and haunting and slow
clementine falls back onto the couch closes her eyes and sips her drink
way to go joel
you pick good
joel sits down in his chair and drinks
theres a silence which seems fine to clementine but makes joel anxious
well i should probably get going
just for a little while
opens her eyes brightly refill
i i know a man who needs a refill
she grabs joels drink from his hand takes it into the kitchen
god bless alcohol is what i say
where would i be without it
oh jesus mary and joseph maybe i dont want to think about that
joel looks around the room again
there are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes a nurse potato a stripper potato a schoolteacher potato a housewife potato
clementine returns with joels drink and a refill for herself
drink up young man
itll make the whole seduction part less repugnant
joel looks a little alarmed
im just kidding
she sits back on the couch closes her eyes
joel watches her looks at her breasts
she opens her eyes smiles drunkenly at him
yknow im sort of psychic
well i go to a psychic and shes always telling me im psychic
she should know
do you believe in that stuff
i dont know
but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know
maybe thats just coincidence
yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it
yeah i dont know
its hard to know
thats exactly my feeling about it
its hard to know
like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen
thats what youre saying right
you forget about those times
yeah i guess
dreamy beat but i think i am
i like to think i am
its helpful to think theres some order to things
youre kind of closed mouthed arent you
my life isnt that interesting
i go to work
i go home
i dont know what to say
considers this does that make you sad
im always anxious thinking im not living my life to the fullest yknow
taking advantage of every possibility
just making sure that im not wasting one second of the little time i have
i think about that
she looks at him really hard for a long moment
joel tries to hold her gaze but cant
he looks down at his drink
clementine starts to cry again
youre really nice
im sorry i yelled at you before about it
god im an idiot
i do have a tendency to use that word too much
i like you
thats the thing about my psychic thing
i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people
my problem is i never trust it
but i get it
and with you i get that youre a really good guy
and anyway you sell yourself short
i can tell
theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain
i can tell
can i tell you my goal
ala paul simon whats the goal joel
laughs my goal joel is to just let it flow through me
do you know what i mean
its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were
all taught we should be consistent
you love someone thats it
you choose to do something with your life thats it thats what you do
its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through
and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing
i think so
its hard to like i wanted to talk to you
i didnt need any more reason to do it
who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist
youre very nice
god i have to stop saying that
youre nervous around me huh
you dont need to be nervous around me though
i like you
do you think im repulsively fat
no not at all
i dont either
i used to
but im through with that
yknow if i dont love my body then im just lost
with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart thats coming round the bend
beat so ive been seeing this guy
joel looks slightly crestfallen
off his reaction well for the last week anyway
hes kind of a kid
kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering
who wouldnt like that
and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart
hes the one who gave me that crow photograph
that made me cry
but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river
it gets frozen this time of year
thats scary sounding
i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and
he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him
and thats where psychic stuff comes in
like it just isnt right with him
i think so
i dont believe in that soulmate crap anymore but
he says so many great things
we like the same writers
this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to
and hes cute
its fucked up
joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime
she sits closer to him
ill pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and shy sounds good
but right now i should go
pause you should stay
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so
joel puts on his overcoat
clementine heads to the phone table pulls out a notepad
i would like you to call me
would you do that
i would like that
she scribbles her phone number hands it to him
he puts it in his pocket
he stands there uncomfortably for a moment then forces himself to speak
i dont think your personality comes out of a tube
i think the hair is just
a pretty topping
she tears up swallows and kisses him on the cheek
hes surprised and pleased and nervous
shyly formal so i enjoyed meeting you
youll call me right
just to test out the phone lines and all
we stay with clementine as she watches joel tromping through the snow and getting in his car
joel speeds through the suburban rockville center neighborhood
there is no snow on the ground
he seems different somehow foggy and disoriented
he arrives at his apartment building and parks
joel gets out of his car spots a van parked across the street
there are two dark figures inside
he hurries inside the building
joel enters dumps his overcoat on a chair turns off the lights crosses to look furtively out the window
its snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam of a streetlight
it was snowing
there are two of them
couldnt make them out
the orange glow of a cigarette
joel squints to see inside the van
two dark figures talk
one sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily illuminates the interior
the figure in the driver seat rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to joel
the driver waved
so casual friendly
im like a joke to them
joel pulls away from the window his face blanched
i guess they figure they can act like they want
they dont have to worry about me remembering
he paces mulling things over
as he does the scene starts to change almost as if it is drying out
i might be making a mistake
maybe im making a mistake
maybe i just need to learn to live with this
first of all ill get over it
secondly it happened
those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it
who said that
im not sure
but i dont care
she did it to me
i have to rid myself of this
fuck you clementine
the colors bleach the surroundings become slightly vague
even joels persona and voice over seem to alter his emotional intensity becoming diffused
joel does not seem aware of this
he stops pacing takes a small vial from his pocket dumps the lone pill onto his palm
he looks at it
theres some illegible initials stamped on it
beat there was a number on it
beat i have to follow through with this
i have no choice
the pill was pink i remember
it had some letters and numbers on it
what were they
i dont like taking pills when i dont know what they are
i have no choice
he swallows it peeks out the window again takes off his clothes slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store packaging
he sits on the edge of the bed dials the phone
were sorry the number you have dialed
beat screw you clementine for doing this
were sorry the number you have dialed is no longer in service
if you think you have reached this recording in error bye
joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed
by now the scene is lifeless almost a husk
he hears the apartment building door open
he hears footsteps
its too late
his eyelids are getting heavy
he closes his eyes
he hears a key in his apartment door
joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop
its a jarring transition visually and emotionally
joel is in the midst of some traumatic state of mind
he fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches clementine stack books on shelves
her hair is bright orange now
i should maybe talk to you
i should just maybe talk to her
joel rises and heads toward clementine
i love you and if you knew that
if i told you what happened
ill explain everything what we meant to each other
ill tell you everything about our time together
youll know everything again and
maybe if i just explain what happened i wouldnt have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could
rebuild and we could be happy again and
right before joel gets there patrick a skinny young man approaches clementine
joel stops watches
the young man seems out of breath
he glances over at joel then taps clementine on the shoulder
she turns annoyed sees who it is and her face lights up
thats your look for me
clementine giggles stands and pokes patrick playfully in the ribs
i just thought id say hi
i was in the neighborhood
you were not
i was not
joel is mesmerized by their familiarity
as he stands there the scene starts to dry out
clementine and patrick continue their flirtation but its turning lifeless as if they are just reciting lines
the bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy
come over after im done here
i want to but i have to study
i really want to but tonights important
how could she have done this to me
how could anyone do this to anyone
to patrick you didnt say anything about my hair
its so cool
youre by far the most sensational person in the room
in the room
in the world
joel seems dazed in some sort of dream confusion as he realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd
whats happening here
looks at watch its oh god
i have to go home
theyll be there soon
joel turns to leave
joel drives fast recklessly
the intensity is back
hes weeping as he drives
gotta get home
how could she do this to me
how could she not care about what we meant to each other
what a fuck
what a fucking monster she is
i miss her
i cant believe shes with that guy now
im never going to see her again
i love her so much
what a fucking monster she is
the scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment building and gets out of the car
joel spots the parked van
weve seen this before but its dried out now
joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff
hes been crying
he looks behind him and finds himself looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on the snowy street
he turns back to the new york street and spots the address he was looking for th avenue
joel sits in the small room with his bags
a woman across from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap
her eyes are red from crying
mary the receptionist pokes her head through her window into the waiting room
hello again mr
good youve got your stuff
joel walks with his bags behind mary
not looking back how are you today
at lab here we are
mierzwiak stands there with stan in his lab coat
this is stan
hell be in charge of your procedure tonight
stan nods professionally
how exactly is this going to work tonight
as mierzwiak talks the room colors start to fade mierzwiaks tone of voice is also affected it becomes dry and monotonous
well start with your most recent memories and go backwards there is an emotional core to each of our memories as we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process
by the time you wake up in the morning all memories weve targeted will have withered and disappeared
like a dream upon waking
is there any sort of risk of brain damage
well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking
nothing youll miss
joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment
suddenly he gets it
its happening now
im already in my brain
mierzwiak looks at the fading room
yes i suppose you are
back in his faded memory persona so lets get started if we want the procedure underway tonight we have some work to do
joel is sitting in a chair
electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by stan
mierzwiak watches from the corner
we use the articles you brought to create a map of clementine in your brain
tonight while you sleep well be able to trace the map and erase
but youre tracing and erasing now
its already started
im home in my bed
stan pulls a snow globe from one of joels bags shows it to joel
the equipment registers joels reaction
stan pulls out a potato dressed as a vegas showgirl
joel studies it
the machines register his response
well dispose of these mementos when were done here
that way you wont be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home
stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of clementine printed on it
joel looks at the cup
the machines record his reaction
were getting healthy read outs
the room stan and mierzwiak are now vague and wispy
patrick do me a favor joel is watching stan
stan is not speaking yet his voice continues
and check the voltage levels im not wiping as clean as i would like here
joel looks up
stans voice seems to be coming from above
joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas
his eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines
the machines are operated by stan now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave and by patrick dressed similarly
the monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of joels brain
stan presses buttons and operates a joystick aiming for the lines
patrick who we saw earlier with clementine at the bookstore studies a meter on one of the machines
the voltage looks fine
then check the connections
patrick fiddles with some jacks
does that help
yeah that looks better
the memory is becoming vague characters affects flat
stan pulls out a pile of loose leaf pages
ah your journal
this will be invaluable
reading december th
i met someone tonight
oh christ i dont know what to do
her name is clementine and shes amazing
so alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive
things with naomi and i have been stagnant for so long
the scene is just a shell of itself as stan rattles on
i think we got this one
lets push on
joel looks up at the ceiling
joel snapped into a new memory cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with clementine
there are funny little gifts wind up toys some potatoes dressed as women some clothing clementine has left there some cds
he pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose leaf journal and dumps them in the bag
he gets some clean loose leaf paper and writes december nothing much happened today
i stayed home
naomi worked on her dissertation
the scene is fading as he continues to write
joel looks for an office number
he finds it
the plaque on the door reads lacuna ltd
joel enters the lacuna waiting room
mary sits in the reception area
may i help you
my name is joel barish
i have an appointment
please have a seat
mierzwiak will be right with you
mary leads joel down the hall
without turning how are you today
at mierzwiaks office here we are
joel glimpses mary smiling coquettishly at mierzwiak
joel and mierzwiak are in the sitting area
joel looks at the tape recorder
im sorry you saw one of our notification cards
you never should have
we can help you through this
why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine
thinks then it was a mess
i dont know how it got this way
its kind of a dump dont you think
joel looks up trying to locate the voice
patrick is checking out the apartment
stan monitors the equipment
uninterested its an apartment
not a dump then but kind of plain
and theres a stale smell
sort of stuffy
i dont know
patrick lets just get through this
we have a long night ahead of us
patrick returns to the bedside focuses on the machines for a moment
he glances at the unconscious joel
so who do you think is better looking me or this guy
stan glances sideways at patrick
mierzwiak sits with joel in the sitting area
so well need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from clementine and anything that might remind you of her
the scene is faded and disappearing fast
joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist
so then she just stops calling
i wasnt going to call her
not after the way she was
any messages carmen
carmen the receptionist shakes her head
next day joel approaches the receptionist
any messages for me carmen
shes punishing me for being honest with her
joel is at his office desk on the phone
you have no messages
joel enters checks his phone machine zero messages
joel gets off the elevator approaches carmen who is in conversation with someone else
carmen shakes her head no goes back to her conversation
joel checks his machine zero messages
im just gonna without a moments hesitation he dials the phone
im gonna tell her im through playing games and the number you have dialed has been disconnected
joels eyes bug
joel sits across rob and carrie mid s
why would she do that
if you think you have reached this recording in error please check your number and dial again
i dont know honey
shes punishing me for being honest
i should just go to her house
i dont think you should go there joel
yeah i dont want to seem desperate
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on
just make a clean break
i dont know
i cant believe shed be so goddamn immature
joel look the thing is agitated interrupting joel honey
we have to feed the dog
would you just wait here
just a second
joel nods confused as rob and carrie leave the room and close the door behind them
joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall
he notices the dog asleep on the floor
he grabs a magazine off the coffee table flips through it distractedly as he paces puts it down picks up another
a subscription card falls to the floor
he picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all
it reads clementine kruczynski has had joel barish erased from her memory
please never mention their relationship to her again
th avenue ny ny joel stares at the card incredulous
later rob and carrie are now back in the room
you werent supposed to see that
they cant erase memories
its a joke
its a nasty clementine hoax
sweetie we called the company
joel just stands there
close up of a vague dictionary page
a blank a missing portion especially in a manuscript
joel is on the phone pacing
you cant tell her joel
they explained that
like waking a sleepwalker
it might have a devastating effect
joel drives past vague local landmark
think about it to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection
but what am i supposed to do
move on sweetie
how can i
how can i move on when i know im the only one to carry this love we had
how do i do that
joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive in movie closed for the season
the windows fog up until the outside is completely obscured
joel looks for an address
joel gets off on the sixth floor
he searches for a room number
as he turns the corner he sees that the hallway is faded vague and mostly erased
he keeps walking comes to the door marked lacuna and opens it
inside he can see vague erased version of mary the receptionist
dead monotone hi may i help you
these degraded faded memories allow joel to detach himself and hear whats going on in his bedroom
so marys coming over tonight
joel looks up
stan works the joystick
patrick sits on the bed with joel
just wanted to let you know
i like mary
i like when she comes to visit
i just dont think she likes me
she likes you okay
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over too
i have a girlfriend now
you can if you want
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend
re memory on monitor this ones history
the thing is
my situation is a little weird
my girlfriend situation
patrick we need to focus
stan aims the joystick
joel distractedly reads a book checks the clock goes back to the book
the door opens
he looks up
clementine is staggering in drunk
yo ho ho
the last time i saw you
anyhoo sweetie i done a bad thing
i kinda sorta wrecked your car
i cant believe you wrecked my car
youre driving drunk
i was a little tipsy
dont call me pathetic
well it is pathetic
and fucking irresponsible
you couldve killed somebody
the scene is starting to degrade
the acting becomes anemic
i dont know maybe you did kill somebody
oh christ i didnt kill anybody
its just a fucking dent
youre like some old lady or something
she called me an old lady here too
and i remember i said
and what are you like
jesus are you from the fifties
laughs face it joel
youre freaked out because i was out late without you and in your little wormy brain youre trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight
no see clem i assume you fucked someone tonight
isnt that how you get people to like you
this shuts clementine up
she is stung and she starts gathering up her belongings which are strewn about the apartment
joel is immediately sorry he said this
he follows her around
i didnt mean that
i was just
pissed i guess
clementine is out the door
joel looks at his dented car looks at clementine clomping off in the distance
joel drives to catch up with clementine
he rolls down his window to talk to her
let me drive you home
without turning fuck you joel
look at it out here
its falling apart
im erasing you
and im happy
she keeps clomping
you did it to me
i cant believe you did this to me
by morning youll be gone
he stops the car gets out
its a street you might see in a dream more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one with what little detail there is obscured in darkness
joel wanders it
in the distance clementine walks off but as in an animated loop she doesnt get any farther away
see remember that girl
the one we did last week
the one with the potatoes
joel looks up startled
yeah thats this guys girlfriend
stan watches the screen
patrick paces fidgets looks at the unconscious joel
i gotta tell you something
i kind of fell in love with her last night
she was unconscious patrick
she was beautiful
so sweet and funky and voluptuous
i kind of stole a pair of her panties is what
on the vague street joel listens to patrick and stan
its not like
i mean they were clean and all
look just dont tell me this stuff
i dont want to know this shit
we have work to do
theres a click and joel finds himself in joel and clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the tv
its hard to make out what theyre watching
they sit on opposite ends of the couch
they look bored
the scene quickly degenerates
the room fades
okay but theres more
after we did her i went to where she worked and i asked her out
joel looks over at the faded clementine across the couch
she stares straight ahead at the tv
do you know how unethical
that must be the guy i saw you with
in the bookstore that night
the skinny guy
theres a click and joel finds himself in joel watches tv
clementine walks by in her underwear looks at the tv
she slips into a skirt
how can you watch this crap
where are you going
im fucking crawling out of my skin
the scene starts to fade
clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door
joel and clementine walk around unhappily
they barely look at the animals
clementine watches parents with babies
i remember this
to clementine want to go
pissy i want to have a baby
lets talk about it later
i want to have a baby
i have to have a baby
i dont think were ready
youre not ready
clementine do you really think you could take care of a kid
she turns violently toward him glaring
mumbly i dont want to talk about this here
joel were fucking gonna talk about it
joel looks around
people are watching
you cant fucking say something like that and say you dont want to talk about it
clem im sorry
i shouldnt have screaming now id make a fucking good mother
i love children
im creative and smart and id make a fucking good mother
the scene starts to fade
clementines rant continues but becomes attenuated and vague
oh thank god
its you who cant commit to anything
you have no idea how lucky you are im interested in you
i dont even know why i am
i should just end it right here joel
leave you in the zoo
maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with
shes crying now but its almost animatronic no real emotion in it
the scene is a husk
its going clementine
all the crap and hurt and disappointment
its all being wiped away
she looks up at him
their eyes lock
she is fading before his eyes
its noisy and crowded
joel and clementine sit at a small table
she is drunk and staring off blankly
so um swiveling head toward him would you get me another joely
joel sighs stands and heads to the crowded bar
joel is at the bar trying to get the bartenders attention
joel is paying the bartender
he turns with the drink to head back to the table
he sees clementine flirting with a man in joels seat
joel is at the table
clementine looks from her conversation
joel this is mark
he likes my boobs
he came over special to tell me that
isnt that nice
he doesnt think im fat
the scene starts to fade
i didnt know she was with someone man
joel doesnt like my boobs
stage whisper i dont think he likes girls
the bar gets quiet and vague
youre a whiz kid
so perceptive so clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible words just a whisper like a breeze
a doorbell buzzes
joel looks up
patrick opens the door
mary stands there in a winter coat carrying a backpack
coolly oh hey patrick
hows it going
she walks past him
stan and mary kiss
she looks down at joel as she takes off her coat
its freezing out
you found us okay
re joel poor guy
looking around have anything to drink
we havent checked
well allow me to do the honors
its fucking freezing and i need something
she heads into the kitchen
stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light
mary hates me
ive never been popular with the ladies
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties
guilty beat okay theres more stan stan looks over at patrick
mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses
she pours the whiskey
oh patrick you didnt want any did you
nah i dont know
mary hands a glass to stan
she holds hers up in a toast
blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders
mary and stan click glasses
beyond good and evil
found it my bartletts
thats a good one
yeah i cant wait to tell howard
it seems really appropriate
a little sulky its a good one all right
whats your bartletts
its a quote book
i love quotes
so did winston churchill
he actually has a quotation in bartletts about bartletts
isnt that trippy
trying to engage yeah
the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts
i like to read what smart people say
so many beautiful important things
dont you think howards like that
i think hell be in bartletts one day
stan focuses on the monitor
mary pours herself another drink
joel and clementine are in bed
the memory is already in the midst of being erased
clementine is talking in a monotonous robotic manner
you dont tell me things joel
im an open book
i tell you everything
every damn embarrassing thing
you dont trust me
no it isnt that
i want to know you
i just dont have anything very interesting about my life
joel youre a liar
the scene is faded completely now and joel just lies there for a moment registering clementines statement
joel and clementine eat dinner in silence
joel looks around at other couples in the restaurant
some seem happy and engaged
others seem bored with each other
he turns back to his food
hows the chicken
is that like us
are we just bored with each other
he watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself another glass
she holds the wine bottle up to joel
theres a silence
hows the fish
the scene is fading
they continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves
why whats wrong
oh im sorry
well im not sure i kind of have to study for my test patrick is on the phone next to joels bed
stan watches the lights on the computer screen
let me ask my friend
covering mouthpiece stan can i leave for a little while
my girlfriend is very patrick were in the middle of shes right in the neighborhood
mary is in the kitchen
she pokes her head out
shes got some pie on a plate
let him go stan
i can help
sighing to patrick go
quietly mary hates me
into phone ill be right over tangerine
candles are lit
joel and clementine are under a blanket on the living room rug listening to music
do you know the velveteen rabbit
its my favorite book
since i was a kid
its about these toys
theres this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real
crying i cant believe im crying already
he says it takes a long time
thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept
generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby
but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand
joel is stroking her hair
they kiss and begin to make love under the blanket
its sweet and gentle and then it starts to fade
he looks down and clementines tear streaked face is fading
she continues as if shes still being made love to even though joel is completely beside himself
he jumps up naked and yells at the ceiling
ive changed my mind
looks down at fading clementine then at ceiling i dont want this
wake me up
stop the procedure
plea joel is unconscious on the bed completely still
mary and stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint
after a silence its amazing isnt it
such a gift howard gave the world
a sigh yeah
to let people begin again
you look at a baby and its so fresh so clean so free
theyre like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness
and howard just makes it go away
you love him dont you
mary seems surprised taken aback caught
she is silent for a long moment
beat besides howards married stan
hes a very serious and ethical man
im not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in
stan takes another drag on the joint passes it to mary
patrick bundled up and carrying a full backpack trudges through the snow
clementine watches out the window as patrick nears
he makes his way up her front stairs
she swings open the door and hugs him
oh baby whats going on
i dont know
i feel like im disappearing
im getting old and nothing makes any sense to me
nothing makes any sense
nothing makes any sense
she pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at patrick
come up to boston with me
well go next weekend and now
i have to go now
i have to see the frozen charles
ill call my study partner
itll be great
ill get my shit
she runs into the bedroom
patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesnt know joels number
after a moments thought he s
the phone rings
hi its joel
please leave a message after the beep
whisper stan its patrick
hey where are you
i got into a situation with the old lady
can you handle things tonight alone
im really sorry man
stan is on the phone
hes really stoned and watches mary stoned herself dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo
i can handle it
hes pretty much on auto pilot anyway
i owe you
patrick hangs up rifles quickly through his backpack
he pulls out a silver bracelet puts it in his pocket then pulls out a journal flips through it keeping an eye on the bedroom door
the handwriting is a womans
he finds what hes looking for
he reads i took joel to walk on charles river with me last night
it was so beautiful and charming
joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice but he wanted to please me so much hes so sweet that he came out after me
we lay down right in the center and watched the stars
he took my hand and said i could
joel and clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river
they look up at the stars
die right now clem
ive never felt that before
im just exactly where i want to be
clementine looks over at him
her eyes are filled with love and tears
then they get vague
the scene is being erased
joel is panicked
this cant keep happening
crazily joel runs off passing through a series of decayed scenes he and clementine arguing in a car having sex on the beach laughing and holding hands at a movie
eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed joel watching her sleep them drinking at a bar
he arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with mierzwiak
we can help you through this
why dont you start now by telling me everything you can remember about you have to stop this
what do you mean
im trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased
stop it now
im just something youre imagining
what can i do
im in your head too
patrick reads the journal
and we made love right on the ice
it was absolutely freezing on my ass
it was wonderful
clementine enters dressed for the cold
patrick puts the notebook away
im so excited
im excited too
oh and i wanted to give you this
its a little
patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket hands it to her
i didnt have a chance to wrap it
slipping it on just my taste
ive never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked
kisses him thanks
so lets get going
stan and mary have sex on the floor next to joels bed
joel and clementine are hiking clementine in front
such a beautiful view
looking at her yes indeed
snapping out of memory fuck
theyre erasing you clem
i hired them to
were in my brain
but i want it to stop before i wake up and dont know you anymore
cant you just force yourself awake
i dont know
he starts to have a fit banging against trees stomping his feet screaming
but even while hes doing this the memory and clementine are fading around him
its raining out
joel is reading slouched in a chair
he looks over at clementine stretched out on her belly in her underwear
shes reading too
shes so sexy
i loved you on this day
i love this memory
us just hanging
clementine looks over at him smiles
her brow furrows in thought
what if you hide me
what do you mean
if theyre looking for me in memories im in what if you take me to a memory im not in
proud and we can hide there till morning
joel ponders this
the scene and clementine are beginning to dissolve
joel grabs clementines hand
she giggles with glee
he pulls her out of the scene as it degrades
he drags her through the landscape of already decayed memories and turns off into the kitchen is dated and vague
joel and clementine are in an oversized playpen theyre adults but small
joel wears footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them
he holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll
clementine is still in her panties and bra
an oversized woman in high heels seen from a low angle hurries back and forth preparing dinner
joel looks around at the kitchen at his doll at the woman
i must be about two
oddly i want my mommy
shes not looking at me
back to himself re doll look my huckleberry hound doll
i told you about this
beat i want my mommy
he starts to cry
clementine tries to comfort him
she hugs him
crying still i want my mommy
adult to clementine i dont want to lose you clem
im right here
i want my mommy
i dont want to lose you
i dont want to lose
joel joely look
its not fading
i think were hidden
joel sucks in some snot
his mother scurries back and forth clanging pots
the room is not decaying
stan and mary lie on the floor their stoned minds wandering after sex
stan suddenly perks up
he looks at the monitor
listen its not erasing
he makes his way naked to the computer screen
its not erasing
hes off the screen
i dont know
hes not on the map
stan tries to break through his marijuana haze
he fiddles nervously with the equipment
i dont know what to do
i dont know what to do
well what should we do
i dont know
i just said that
sor ry beat we have to do something
he cant wake up half done
he jerks the joystick spastically
mary also naked gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen
definitely we should call howard
stan turns and looks at her
hes stoned and trying to understand her motivation
i can handle this
this guys only half cooked
theres no time to fuck around stan
stan tries to think
mary watches him
finally without making eye contact okay
he dials the phone waits
the room is dark
a groggy mierzwiak is in bed on the phone
his wife lies beside him eyes open listening
whats going on
the guy were doing
hes disappeared from the map
i cant find him anywhere
okay what happened right before he disappeared
i was away from the monitor for a second
i had it on automatic
i had to go pee
well where was patrick
he went home sick
all right whats the address
apartment e rockville center
mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad
he hangs up
stan hangs up the phone looks at mary
you better go
she starts getting dressed
shit im so stoned
i dont want him to see me stoned
stop being stoned mary
she hurries into the bathroom with her bag
god i look like shit
mary slams the bathroom door
stan puts his head in his hands
joel and clementine are in the playpen
joels oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats joel on the head
hows my baby boy
i really want her to pick me up
its weird how strong that desire is
clementine holds his hand
he looks over at her
you know were okay
theyre not finding us
youll remember me in the morning
and youll come to me and tell me about us and well start over
i loved you so much this day
on my bed in your panties
i remember i thought how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties
she kisses him
you remember what happened next
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty
and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like another rainy day
whatever shall we do
she unbuttons his pajamas
they begin to make love
joels mother hurries around the kitchen
joel stops looks at clementine
theres this guy
theres this guy
i heard him talking in my apartment
hes one of the eraser guys
and he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now youre dating him
is he cute
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased
you must remember to tell me this in the morning
im like so freaked out now
its a rust bucket
clementine drives through the snow
shes crying and holding patricks hand
whats wrong with me
nothing is wrong with you
youre the most wonderful person ive ever met
she glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even harder
stan works on trying to get the signal back
his hair is combed and hes dressed neatly looking professional but still stoned
mary is pacing nervously to and from the window looking out into the night
shes dressed also and shes wearing more make up now
her hair is pulled up into some sort of style
suddenly she freezes at the window
there he is
oh my god
oh my god
do i look okay
she doesnt say anything
im still stoned
she looks in the mirror
to joel your visine didnt do shit fella
the doorbell buzzes
mary lunges for the door then calms herself before opening it
mierzwiak holding an equipment bag looks surprised
what are you doing here
she came to help howard
i wanted to learn as much about the procedure as possible howard
i think its important for my job
to help comfort the clientele
mierzwiak looks from mary to stan nods and enters
mary closes the door
mierzwiak crosses to the equipment
lets get to the bottom of this
he sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling
he fiddles some more
mary looks on fascinated
i tried that already
did you try going through c gate
he unzips his equipment bag pulls out another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system
im going to do a spectrum search throughout his memory see if anything comes up
mierzwiak presses some more buttons
the program starts up
a much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this screen
eventually mierzwiak sees a small distant light in the brain
he zeroes in on it
okay here it is
i dont know why its off the map like that but joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother
clementine sits in the water with him laughing
the mother doesnt seem to see her
little baby getting awwwl cleean
to clementine i love getting bathed in the sink
its such a feeling of security
giggling ive never seen you happier
the elements of the scene flash explosively away joels mother his huckleberry hound doll the details of the kitchen clementine
joel is thrown into he sits with clementine in the parked car outside a drive in movie theater
the movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence
joel and clementine drink wine
mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen
okay were back in
that was beautiful to watch howard
like a surgeon or a concert pianist
well thank you mary
sighing you get some sleep howard
ill take it from here
yeah probably a good idea
clementine and joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying
but cant you see
i love you antoine
dont call me antoine
my name is wally
yes but i cant love a man named wally
she starts to fade
the scene starts to fade
joel remembers their previous plan
they found us before
the plan didnt work
i dont know what to do now
mouthing to woman on screen hide me somewhere deeper
joel grabs her
they run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them
stan is back at the controls
mierzwiaks at the door with mary
howard theyve disappeared again
im so sorry howard you must be tired
he nods distractedly
she smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment
joel now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack
clementine is with him dressed as she was in the parked car
look at you cutey
what are we doing
this kid joe early is going to beat the shit out of me
i thought if i hung around the art room long enough hed go home and i could get my bike
they head toward the bike rack
joels is the only bike remaining
theyre at the bike rack and a bunch of kids including giant fat joe early come around the corner
he calls me jill
everyone calls me jill after this
the other kids laughs
just shut up joe
im going home
i dont think so
i dont want to fight you
the kids start chanting fight fight fight
joe early throws a wild punch that hits joel in the side
joel falls and stays down covering himself
get up faggot
joel doesnt say anything
he peeks humiliated at clementine
shes watching him
shes got a tear in her eye
she kneels down beside him puts her arm around him
im too scared to even throw a punch
when i tell people this story i leave that part out
the scene flashes violently to white and is gone
mierzwiak is at the machine
we got him back
stan i think im just going to have to get through this manually
were running late
joel and clementine walk all bundled up
she points at a house up the beach
she runs ahead laughing
the scene is decaying
joel chases after her
clem cmon weve got to hide you
he grabs her arm and yanks and they are in its dark
joel junior high school size is in bed masturbating
clementine is in there too in her winter coat still laughing from before
she realizes whats going on
mock offended joel
continuing to masturbate i dont like it either but im just trying to find horrible secret place to joels mother pops her head in the door
joel i was just sees whats going on oh
ill ask you in the morning honey
have a good night
the mother backs out closes the door
clementine laughs still in the mode of the memory she was swiped from
its all gone
joel and clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle on a slice of cheesecake in front of her
joel hands her a small wrapped box
unwrapping the gift thanks joely
she pulls out the bracelet
its the same bracelet patrick gave her
slip it on i mean youre the first guy who ever bought me a piece of jewelry i could honestly say that about
he notices shes starting to fade
i scoured the city for it
i love it
she leans across the table to kiss him
he grabs her and runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night
joel is one of a group of five year olds
he holds a hammer and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon
the other boys are goading him
cmon joel you have to
do it already
joel doesnt want to
i have to go home
ill do it later
i didnt want to do this
but i had to or they wouldve called me a girl
joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer
red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom
the kids hoot
i cant believe i did that
im so ashamed
a live bird watches from a tree
clementine still dressed for her birthday dinner wearing her new bracelet pulls joel away from the other boys
the two of them walk down joels suburban street
you were a little kid
beat this is a great birthday present
getting to see you as a boy
she kisses him and they walk holding hands
pointing thats where i live
joel looks down at her hand
the bracelet is gone
clementine is gone
his childhood house is gone
mierzwiak works the equipment
he has located a small area of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them
im getting the hang of it
i still understand it
but im finding him quickly enough
im hopeful there wont be too much peripheral eradication
mary sits on the bed
a little giggly i like watching you work
stan sighs grabs his coat
ill go out for a smoke
if no one minds
not looking up thats fine stan
mary doesnt say anything
stan huffs and is out the door
mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light
mary gets up her courage to speak
do you like quotes howard
how do you mean
oh um like famous quotes
i find reading them inspirational to me
and in my reading ive come across some i thought you might like too
well id love to hear some
mary is thrilled beside herself
she tries to calm down
okay um theres one that goes blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders
is that nietzsche
yeah yeah it is howard
and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didnt know
its a good quote mary
im glad we both know it
he smiles at her
shes flustered flattered
sputtering theres another one i like i read
its by pope alexander
puts hand over mouth sorry
its just i told myself i wasnt going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it
like i psyched myself out
its no big deal
you are such a sweetheart
theres an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air
then mary plunges ahead to bury it
anyway the quote goes how happy is the blameless vestals lot
the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
each prayer accepted and each wish resignd
she smiles proud and embarrassed
i thought it was appropriate maybe
beat then quickly i really admire the work that you do
i know its not proper to be so familiar but i guess since were outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to its fine mary
im happy to hear it
blurting i like you howard
an awful lot
is that terrible
mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback then returns to his unflappable self
youre a wonderful girl mary
she leans over and kisses him then pulls away quickly
ive loved you for a very long time
i shouldnt have said that
ive got a wife mary
you know that
suddenly weepy i wish i was your wife
i wish i had your kids
mierzwiak comforts her with a hug
it turns into kiss
he pulls away
we cant do this
no youre right
youre a decent man howard
he smiles sadly at her
she smiles courageously at him
i want you to know its not because im not interested
if that means anything
they look at each other a long while then howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights
stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette
he has an unobstructed view into joels bedroom window
he watches mierzwiak and mary
theyre talking as howard works
it appears to be a very serious discussion
a car pulls up outside
stan turns to see
a middle aged woman gets out checks the address on joels building approaches the only lit window watches mierzwiak and mary inside
mierzwiaks resolve has apparently weakened and he and mary kiss again
this time it leads to groping partial undressing and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious joel
the woman in the window is transfixed
as mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants he catches sight of the woman in the window
he practically shrieks and jumps up
joel and clementine walking hand in hand look up simultaneously
mary looks confusedly at howard
she follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window who turns and walks off in a huff
oh my god
mierzwiak is already in his coat
hes out the door
the woman is at her car
stan watches from the van
mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman
i knew it howard
i dont even know why i bothered to copy the damn address
it didnt start out to be this
i came here to work
its a one time mistake
mary is right behind mierzwiak now
hollis is in her car
mierzwiak its true
and its not mr
im a stupid little girl with a stupid little crush
i basically forced him into it
hollis turns looks at mary and then at mierzwiak
dont be a monster howard
tell the girl
stan is out of the van now listening
mary shivers in the cold hugs herself
theres a long silence
then tell me what
hollis and mierzwiak have locked eyes
mary looks back and forth between them
hollis starts her car
you can have him
she drives off
mary watches howard with increased foreboding
have a history
you wanted the procedure
you wanted it done
to get past
i have to finish in there
its almost morning
well talk later
he shuffles inside
mary stands there unable to digest this struggling in vain to remember
let me take you home
mary shakes her head no
she walks off dazed
clementine and patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river and look up at the night sky
i could die right now clem
im just happy
ive never felt that before
im just exactly where i want to be
clementine looks over at him
their eyes meet
i want to go home
she hurries toward the shore slips on the ice gets up and continues now running
mary in shock sits in the empty fluorescent car
she tries to look out the window but can only see her own reflection
its deathly silent as mierzwiak and stan work on completing the job
mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the map of joels brain
he targets it
joel the size of a ten year old sits fishing with his oversized father
clementine is naked and in the boat too
shes reading the play by stephen dixon
i love this book joel
thank you so much for telling me about it
joel is his father
the father is drunk and sullen
he faces away from joel looks out at the lake
dont be like me son
dont waste your life
youll come to a point someday where itll be too late
youll be sewn into your fate
it was horrifying seeing my father like that
there was no hope for me if his life was such a failure
and he saw failure in me too written in my future
clementine watches the frightened confused joel
joel youre not sewn in
and therell be nowhere to go except where youre headed like a train on a track
the scene poops out of existence with a flash of light
joel finds himself eating chinese food and sitting across from clementine
he is ragged and jarred
im done clem
im just going to ride it out
hiding is clearly not working
i want to enjoy my little time left with you
this is our first date date
do you remember what we talked about
naomi i guess
what was i wearing
god i should know
your hair was red
i remember it matched the wallpaper
egad were you horrified
i think you were wearing that black dress yknow with the buttons
she is wearing the black dress
no you were with me when i bought that
at that place on east th
it was later
the scene has already been erased
its just a decayed husk
a vague joel watches a vague clementine model a black dress
clementine wears a generic black dress now
something black though
ill buy that
blacks always good
we did talk about naomi
i said are you sure
you seem unsure
im sure i said
but you werent
i could tell
i was so nervous
i remember i couldnt think of anything to say
there were long silences
there is a long silence
i thought i was foolish
i thought id mistaken infatuation for love
you said so what
infatuation is good too
and i didnt have an argument
joel and clementine pull up to clementines house
i dropped you off after
you said mae west come up and see me
its very late
exactly my point
joel and clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex
this was our first time
the scene starts to fade
joel watches clementine disappear
mary enters the dark room frazzled
she flips on the fluorescent lights and searches the file folders finds one with her name on it
her jaw drops
with a shaky hand she puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses play
okay so just tell me what you remember
and well take it from there
shaky um i liked you immediately
at the job interview
you seemed so
important and mature
and i loved that you were helping all these people
you didnt come on to me at all
i liked that
i was tongue tied around you at first
i wanted you to think i was smart
you were so nice
i loved the way you smelled
i couldnt wait to come to work
i had these fantasies of us being married and having kids and just
starts to cry and so
that one day when i thought you looked at me back
oh howie i cant do this
how can i do this
its whats best mary
you know that
mary slumps to the floor
we move into her eyes
yeah i know
okay well i was so excited
a flirtatious look from mierzwiak
remember you bought me that little wind up frog
a vague shot of a wind up frog
and you said
a vague shot of mierzwiak mouthing to marys voice
this is for your desk
just a little token back to mary sitting on the floor listening to the tape
i knew then
i knew something was going to happen
joel sits in the quiet living room
the scene is fading
on the couch
i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake
i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times
i thought i could take it back erase it explain i had momentarily lost my mind
then i told myself we werent happy
that was the truth
that what we were was safe
it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason
i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if
it wasnt much fun
but i wanted fun
i saw other people having fun and i wanted it
then i thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun im being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit
then i thought maybe not maybe not
and then i thought as i always do at this point in my argument about dying
an elderly man sits
i projected myself to the end of my life in some vague rendition of my old man self
i imagined looking back with a tremendous hole of regret in my heart
i didnt pick up the phone to call you naomi
i didnt pick up the phone
the scene dissolves
namoi is red eyed from crying
she is packing things in boxes
joel paces steals glances at her doesnt know what to say
she holds up a book
the scene starts to fade
you take it
i dont know
she tosses it in a box
naomi i really value our relationship
i hope its possible for us to stay in touch
dont do this to me now joel
joel watches out the window as naomi stuffs a final box in the trunk of a car
theres another woman down there with her
they get into the car and drive off
joel talks to clementine
the scene is fogging over
i told her today i need to end it
is that what you want
i did it
i guess that means something
the scene fades
joel walks with naomi
so whats going on joel
i dont know ive just been thinking maybe were not happy with each other
yknow weve been i dont know sort of unhappy with each other and dont say we when you mean you
i think maybe were both so used to operating at this level that how can one person be unhappy
if one person is unhappy both have to be
who is it
you met someone
i just need some space maybe
the thing is joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off youre just going to be joel with the same fucking problems
its not somebody else
i hate myself
naomi walks off
joel watches her
the scene fades
joel enters looks around
theres no sign of clementine
joel approaches a male employee
is there a clementine who works here
calling to another male employee mark is clem on tonight
on my dick bro
turns sese joel embarrassed oh hey
yeah i think shes upstairs in philosophy
joel climbs stairs searches the aisle spots clementine
i didnt think youd show your face around me again
i figured you were humiliated
you did run away after all
sorry to track you down like this
im not a stalker
but i needed to see you
seemingly uninterested yeah
id like to
take you out or something
well youre married
look man im telling you right off the bat im high maintenance
so im not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there
if you want to be with me youre with me
so make your domestic decisions and maybe well talk again
she goes back to stacking
joel stands there helplessly
i just think that you have some kind of
quality that seems really important to me
the scene is disintegrating
clementines speech is delivered without passion
joel im not a concept
i want you to just keep that in your head
too many guys think im a concept or i complete them or im going to make them alive but im just a fucked up girl who is looking for my
own peace of mind
dont assign me yours
i remember that speech really well
smiling i had you pegged didnt i
you had the whole human race pegged
i still thought you were going to save me
even after that
it would be different if we could just give it another go around
try your best
maybe we can
the scene is gone
joel sits forlornly in the back seat
rob drives and carrie sits in the front passenger seat
the car stops in front of joels apartment building
i hope you feel better sweetie
say hi to naomi
the car door closes
joel climbs the stairs
i hope shes not up
i need to think
the lights are off
joel sits on a chair near the window writing in his journal
the streetlight illuminates the paper
naomi sleeps in the bed
i met someone tonight at a party on the beach
her name is clementine
there is something alive about her
naomi turns over in bed sees joel
full of sleep hi
how was it
you didnt miss much
rob carrie say hello
hi rob and carrie
go back to sleep
the room is starting to decompose
come to bed
in a minute
naomi turns over
joel goes back to his writing
more and more emotionless i dont know what to do about this
ive been feeling so alienated and numb lately
the thought of not acknowledging my feelings again seems self destructive
how can i continue on this path toward a living death a life filled with obligation and guilt and responsibility but joyless hopeless
i need to speak with clementine
the scene has turned to a husk
joel is at his closet putting on a sweater
naomi is at the dining room table papers spread out before her writing
joel turns and watches her for a moment
so you dont mind
ive got to finish this chapter anyway
the scene is fading
i wish you could come
this is it
the night we met
my god its over
he approaches naomi kisses her on the top of the head
she continues to write
say hi to rob and carrie
have some fun
i hope you get your work done
carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front passenger seat
joel sits in the back
im sorry naomi couldnt make it
you seem quiet
just a little overworked maybe
the trip to the party where i met clementine
my first memory of her is now my last memory of her
joel looks out the window
carrie turns around and says something to joel
she is backlit her hair a halo of frizz
i remember you turned around
your face was dark and your hair was backlit i could see a halo of frizz you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me
you said things were fine
this is the night you met clementine joel
i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought oh shit
yeah you told me that later
i told you that later
joel looks out he window
he sees the husk of a memory on the darkened roadside
its joel and carrie in faded
carrie and joel sit at the table with coffee
who was the girl you walked off with
rob carrie and joel emerge from the car parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot
joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along
is this the right way
joel rob and carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach
people and music can be heard
joel sits on a log a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap
people warm themselves at the fire
joel watches couples talking kissing rob sharing a joint with a guy
you were down by the surf
i could just make you out in the dark
joel looks down to the water
theres clementine in her orange hooded sweatshirt looking out to sea
your back to me
in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually
at the time i thought how cool an orange sweatshirt
i remember being drawn to you even then
i thought i love this woman because shes alone down there looking out at the black ocean
but i went back to my food
the next thing i remember i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye
a shot of the orange sleeve
joel looks up
i was so nervous
what were you doing there i wondered
your hair was lime green
a shot of her green hair
i saw you sitting over here
i thought thank god someone normal who doesnt know how interact at these things either
i dont ever know what to say
i cant tell you how happy i am to hear that
i mean i dont mean im happy youre uncomfortable but yknow
im such a loser
every time i come to a party i tell myself im going to be different and its always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such
even then i didnt believe you entirely
i thought how could you be talking to me if you couldnt talk to people
but i thought i dont know i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it
but i dont know maybe were the normal ones yknow
i mean what kind of people do well at this stuff
and i just liked you so much
you liked me
you know what i did
yeah i know
you said she picks a drumstick off of joels plate
can i borrow a piece of your chicken
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers
i remember the grease on your chin in the bonfire light
shot of a smudge of chicken grease on clementines chin
oh god how horrid
no it was lovely
so no jokes about my name
you mean like
singing oh my darlin oh my darlin oh my darlin clementine
that sort of thing
yeah like that
my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll
i think your name is magic
eyes welling this is it joel
its gonna be gone soon
what do we do
say good bye
joel and clementine are walking near the surf
so youre still on the zoloft
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf
no i stopped
i didnt want to feel like i was being artificially modulated
i know what you mean
thats why i stopped
but my sleeping is really fucked up
i dont think ive slept in a year
you should try xanax
i mean its a chemical and all but it works
and it works just having it around knowing that its there
ill give you a couple
see what you think
have you ever read any anna akhmatova
i love her
i dont meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store
i think shes great
theres this poem did this conversation come before or after we saw the house
i think before
seems too coincidental that way
joel and clementine wander near some beach houses closed for the winter
do you know her poem that starts seaside gusts of wind and a house in which we dont live
it goes perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines
i love that poem
it breaks my heart
im so excited you know it
pointing to houses look houses in which we dont live
joel chuckles appreciatively
i wish we did
lets move into this neighborhood
clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house
joel is nervous
i do sort of live with somebody though
she walks to the next house tries the door
male or female
at least i havent been barking up the wrong tree
she finds a window thats unlatched
she lifts it
what are you doing
its freezing out here
she scrambles in the window
joel looks around panicked
i couldnt believe you did that
i was paralyzed with fear
the front door opens and clementine stands there beckoning
the waters fine
nobodys coming here tonight believe me
this place is closed up
i hesitated for what seemed like forever
i could see you wanted to come in joel
he walks cautiously toward the door
as soon as you walked in
i knew i had you
you knew i knew that right
joel enters the darkened and clementine closes the door behind him
i knew by your nervousness that naomi wasnt the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass
whats your girlfriends name
shes searching through drawers for something
she pulls out a flashlight shines it in joels face
now i can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet
i think we should go
no its our house
just tonight looking at envelope on counter were david and ruth laskin
which one do you want to be
i prefer to be ruth but im flexible
opens cabinet alcohol
you make drinks
im going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth
im ruthless at the moment
she runs upstairs giggling
the room is drying out turning into a husk
calling after her i really should go
i really need to catch my ride
i didnt want to go
i was too nervous
i thought maybe you were a nut
but you were exciting
you called from upstairs
flat so go
i walked out the door
i felt like i was a scared little kid
i thought you knew that about me
i ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation
you said so go with such disdain
poking her head downstairs what if you stay this time
i walked out the door
theres no more memory
come back and make up a good bye at least
lets pretend we had one
clementine comes downstairs vague and robotic making her way through the decaying environment
i love you
joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire
this scene too is disintegrating
it dries up and joel is just standing there on a faded beach at night the bonfire frozen in the distance like a photograph
joel sits in the back seat rob and carrie are in the front
did you have fun
joel nods glumly
carrie continues to talk but her voice goes under as joel studies the faded husks of memories piled like refuse outside the moving car window
he sees dried out version of previous interactions with clementine playing out in loops
he looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the beach with rob and carrie
it too is decaying
soon all has crumbled into dust
everything goes black
howard watches the monitor
the last specks of light are fading
it grows dark
he is tired his eyes are hollow
he turns to stan who is staring out the window at the dawn
stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean up
he pulls the electrodes off of joels scalp coils cable packs bags
howard dials the bedside phone
he waits as it rings
hi youve reached the mierzwiaks
we cant come to howard hangs up
stan and howard load the last of the equipment into the back of the van
he and howard look at each other
so ive got to drop the van off
patrick and mary are heading home from boston
mary is silent and depressed
patrick tries to break the silence
you want to stop for coffee or something
mary shakes her head no
well it was sure beautiful on that river
thanks for sharing it with me
mary doesnt say anything
well do it again soon
stan pulls the van into space marked lacuna
he gets out crosses to his car
mary is sitting on the hood
beat do you swear you didnt know
and you never even suspected
never saw us behaving in any unusual way together
she watches him closely waiting for him to continue
it was here
at his car
i was coming back from a job and spotted you together
you seemed caught
how did i look
happy with a secret
mary starts to cry
and after that
i never saw you together like that again
so i figured i was imagining things
mary says nothing
i really like you mary
you know that
do you remember anything else
what i was wearing
was i standing close to him
was i leaning against his car like i owned it
how did he look at me when i giggled
tell me everything
thinking you were in red
that red sweater with the little flowers i think
you were leaning against his car
thinking he looked a little like a kid
kind of goofy and wide eyed
id never seen him look like that before
you looked beautiful
you looked in love
heading toward the levator thanks stan
she stops but doesnt turn to face him
beat but i love him
i knew i loved him
now i know
she waves heads to the elevator
the apartment is neat like when he went to sleep
he gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom
joel waits on the crowded platform
the platform across the tracks is empty
joels train arrives
he squeezes on with all the other commuters
joel works in his cubicle over the light table
he seems distracted
he dials his phone
how are you
i know i know
its been a long time
not too much
oh thats great
maybe i could buy you dinner to celebrate
mary does paperwork at her desk
she looks through her reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with their bags of stuff
mierzwiak dials his phone and waits
he hangs up
mary enters with the papers
i need this signed howard
he takes it unable to make eye contact
he signs it hands it back
do we talk about this
i dont know what im supposed say mary
i want to do the right thing here
do you love me
did you love me
i listened to my tape
i cant believe ive been sitting right in front of it for a year
its like listening to someone elses story
i mean i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i cant even imagine you naked
i cant even say naked to you
i have a family mary
you made me have an abortion
it was a mutual decision
you made me have you erased
i loved you
i love you
how could you i didnt make you
you thought it best
off her stare but look i take full responsibility
she looks at him for a long while
then out of frustration she screams
joel sits across from naomi
oddly cautious so
you havent been involved with anyone in all this time
its been a pretty lonely couple of years
well it was my fault the break up
it really does cut both ways
we were taking each other for granted and i miss you
miss you too
awkward pause i have been seeing someone for a little while
trying for enthusiasm oh
a religion instructor at columbia
a good guy
hes a good guy
i really shouldnt have im glad you called
joel and naomi are in bed having sex
there are certain sexual routines habits they have fallen back into almost immediately
she sticks her tongue in his ear in a way thats trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him
they finish and lie there
so you think the dissertation will get published
i don t know
im not sure theres a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny
clementine lies in bed with patrick
the platform is crowded with business commuters
joel is among them
the platform across the tracks from them is empty
suddenly joel turns and makes his way through the crowd
he climbs the stairs crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform
an almost empty train pulls into that platform
joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station
mary gets out of bed
she has been crying all night
shes a wreck
she puts on some coffee then crosses into the living room area
sitting there are piles of the files from work
she pulls the top one out copies the name and address onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in
she pulls another file out
this one has joels name on it
she copies it onto an envelope
joel says goodbye to clementine
so youll call me right
just to test out the phone lines
we stay on clementine as she watches joel head to his car tromping through the snow
joel enters drops his overcoat on a chair dials the phone
hi naomi its joel
hows it going
i called you at work today
they said you were home sick
i had to take the day to think
yeah i tried you at home
did you get my message
i just got in
long day thinking
joel flips on messages with volume down
yeah i suppose so
they told me you were sick
where are you
i had a really nice time last night
just wanted to say hi so
there you are
pause naomi its just
im afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had
i suppose youre right
i had a good time last night
i really did
so im going to get some sleep
im glad youre okay
well speak soon
she hangs up and joel stands there for a minute feeling creepy then he dials the number on a piece of paper
what took you so long
i just walked in
do you miss me
oddly enough i do
you said i do
i guess that means were married
i guess so
honeymoon on ice
clementine steps out onto it
joel follows nervously
its really solid this time of year
i dont know
she takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence
this is so beautiful
she squeezes his hand
she runs and slides on the ice
joel is by himself now
i dont know
what if it breaks
clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars
joel is paralyzed
he looks back at the shore
i think i should go back
joel come here
he hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her
she reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down
he lies on his back beside her their bodies touching
he wants to turn to her but out of shyness doesnt
she holds his hand
they look up at the stars
she smiles doesnt say anything and snuggles closer to him
listen did you want to make love
yknow oh um
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now
i im sorry
i just wanted to say that
this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and hey joel and im just too nervous around you right now
im nervous too
i wouldnt have thought that
well you obviously dont know me
im nervous because i have and enormous crush on you
she smiles up at the sky
show me which constellations you know
we see people going to their mailboxes finding manila envelopes
one by one they open the envelopes and pull out tapes
we see stunned confused disbelieving reactions as people listen to their tapes
joel drops clementine off
she kisses him
joel enters with his mail
he opens a manila envelope reads the enclosed file sticks the cassette tape in his stereo listens
joel dials the phone
did you send this
is it a joke
i probably got the same thing as you
i mean i havent even told anyone ive met you
who would even know to do this
matter of fact maybe its true then
its my voice on the tape
thats what you have to say
how could it be true
i never even heard of any procedure like this
its a joke
call someone whod know
we see the people we saw opening envelopes now on the phone
we hear over and over is this true
did this really happen
do i know you
is it true
carrie is on the phone
she pauses nervously then speaks yes joel
it is true
we werent supposed to say anything
they say its like waking a sleepwalker
joel hangs up
he dials the phone
i spoke to my friend magda
joel is immersed in the several page document
look i have to go
i have to think
joel weve fucked
weve made love
like a million times
and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night
isnt that lovely
joel doesnt know what to say as this registers
he just stands there dumbly
come over here sweetheart
joel and clementine review their separate lacuna packages together
says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling
says you were a bully
laughing a bully
thats what it says
you drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid
well sounds like me
reading says you were jealous and suspicious
says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests
did i use the term sexual conquests or is that your way of putting it
i dont know
doesnt sound like me
says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake
says you were constantly calling me a slob
laughs its sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly familiar and bored
dont you think
considering i sort of do
but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality
cleaned up enough to be erotic
we should have sex
its old hat for us
she smiles at nervous joel
you know my body like the back of your hand
she unbuttons her blouse
every curve every freckle
she takes off her shirt
he stares at her
he has clearly never seen this body before
youre so beautiful
she approaches him kisses him his arms wrap around her waist for the first time
stan enters the waiting room now crowded with people holding their files a stunned looking lot
there is a new woman in the reception window
the file cases behind her are bare
may i help you
i work here
i used to work here
please just tell howard im here to clean out my desk
into phone mr
mierzwiak stan is here to yes sir
to stan he says he needs to see you
mierzwiak is pale and pacing
she should not have done this stan
as mad as she was
as justifiably i dont know what youre talking about howard
mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people
mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor looking in on the lab where patrick has clearly taken over stans position
he is in the process of interviewing a sad young woman
so i called everybody i know and asked them to tell me everything
now i know my entire history with him but its in the form of a story im losing my mind
this is why people must never be told
its like waking a i dont know what to do
before i thought i was depressed for no reason
now its like ive been assigned a reason
this never shouldve happened maam
well take care of it
i know you dont like me much stan but please talk to mary
she of all people should know this is a dangerous thing shes doing
joel works over his light box
his phone rings
hi its joel
im just yknow passing the time best i can till i can see you
god i cant believe i ever hated you
you must have been crazy
guess what im wearing
i dont know
panties and your dried cum
youre still excited by my irreverence
you havent yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock
i cant stop thinking about you
meet me after work by the old mill
what old mill
is that somewhere we i just wanted to say that
come by my house
mary opens the door
stan stands there with two cups of take out coffee
what do you want stan
i brought some she steps aside for stan to enter
he does looks around sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor
i know what it is
then why did you ask me
i dont know
i just there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office
they have a right to know
howard is a thief
he steals the truth
suddenly weeping i cant remember my baby
i cant remember my baby
it existed and i cant even remember
do you understand that
stan doesnt know what to say
he stands there dumbly
mary slumps into a ball on a chair
mary people come to him voluntarily
i wont allow it
those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
what do you think of that
thats from my quote book
the office is filled with people who want their memories re erased
hysterically remember the alamo
remember the alamo
this is hurting people
long pause then small i dont want to hurt people
breaking down but these things happened
all these little sadnesses the big ones
what if no one remembers
what does that do to the world
beat quietly someone has to remember stan
they look at each other
vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig
i was by myself in the park because my friend davia was sick that day
i was on a swing
there was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog vague shots of a man smiling a scruffy dog on a leash
the man said something like hes friendly vague shot of the man his voice overlapping with the womans
he wont bite
he wont bite
you can pet him if you want
shot of the girl petting the dog
do you want to give him a biscuit
the girl nods
theyre in my car
why dont you excuse me
mary with a headset on looks up startled
she switches off the tape
she has been crying
theres a pile of tapes next to her
the distraught woman is standing there
may i help you
im here for dr
my name is helene kernfeld
yes please have a seat
the doctor will be with you momentarily
the woman sits
mary presses an intercom button
she switches the tape back on
he took me to his car and
vague shot of the girl being raped
the old woman is staring off blankly her giant manuscript in her lap as she travels over the new york skyline
we move into her eyes
vague reenactments of memories intermingle in this undefined space the young girl being raped by the man in the car
a soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered friends
a couple fighting from the womans point of view
find you physically repulsive
i cant even look at you
they look at each other in silence
a little boy being called faggot by an endless succession of boys
the aftermath of a car accident from the drivers pov
mary having an abortion
the old woman and her chair lift out of the line of commuters
its modern and well appointed
the old woman enters sits behind the reception desk drops her manuscript into the drawer
she takes some pills with water
an old man enters
how are you today mary
still dying howard
you dont have to jump down my throat
i was trying to be nice
well dont try
its unbecoming on you
old howard mutters something and disappears into the back
old mary pulls out a file from behind removes a small disc places it in a machine on her desk slips on earphones and listens somewhat wearily but attentively
we watch the color drain from her face but dont hear the recording
another old woman enters the office
old mary looks up seems a bit startled conceals it turns off the tape
may i help you
id like to make an appointment
i think the doctor is free this morning
he can probably take you right away for an initial consultation
the second old woman smiles gratefully
old howard works at his desk
old mary enters with the second old woman
mierzwiak this is clementine kruczynski
shed like to talk to you
old howard and the old mary eye each other
nice to meet you
please have a seat
he indicates a sitting area
he joins her
would you mind if i tape our discussion
she shakes her hear
he punches a couple of buttons on his computer console
a tape recorder starts up and his computer screen lights up so only he can see it
on it we see a whole file on clementine kruczynski a list of fifteen dates of previous erasures stretching back fifty years all of them involving joel barish
so why dont you begin by telling me why youve come here
well i met this man joel three years ago at a senior dance
wed both been alone for so long and
the old woman mary travels in the commuter tube over manhattan
its late the tube is mostly empty
she has earphones on
i remember joel and i were having breakfast an old man and the second old woman eat breakfast
i said something like we should go upstate and see the leaves change
the old man looks up from his cereal and stares blankly
the woman smiles but there is no response
just a dead stare
he just stared at me as if i didnt exist
as if i had never existed
the second old womans clementine voice drones tinnily on in the distance
the old woman with the earphones is dead her eyes glassy and unseeing
his eyes used to be so filled with love
but it was gone
how can i go back to being alone after seeing love
i was alone for so long
what had i done with my life
i was alone so long
the old clementine is unconscious on her bed hooked up to modern versions of the erasing machines
two young technicians monitor the equipment
the womans bedside phone rings
her machine picks up
after a moment hi its joel
whats going on clem
why wont you call me back
please call me
we need to speak
the machine clicks off
one of the technicians reaches over and presses the erase button on the machine
