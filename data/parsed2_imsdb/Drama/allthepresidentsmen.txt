all the presidents men by william goldman b
b if window
href b b by william goldman based on the novel all the presidents men by carl bernstein and bob woodward pre rehearsal version march start with as few credits as
when theyre over we see it in the center of the large dimly lit screen
as the tape is pressed around a door its a major piece of action running maybe five minutes and its all as detailed and accurate as we can make it
with as many if onlys included as possible
if only the tape had been attached up and down instead of around the door wills wouldnt have spotted it and alerted the police if only the first police car
called had gone to investigate baldwin watching from the howard johnson motor inn would have seen their uniforms and radioed hunt and liddy in time for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely away
the break in ends when leeper arrests the five men
he thought he only had one guy so when ten hands were raised he was surprised
the hands are all encased in playtex rubber surgical gloves
hold on the hands a moment then the phone rings
woodward fumbles for the receiver turns on the bed light
he listens a moment
no no trouble harry be right down
he hangs up son of a bitch
he lies back
the apartment is one room a small terrace beyond
not much of a place
woodward lies still staring at the ceiling
he blinks blinks again
it looks early of a saturday morning pretty deserted
those reporters that are around are young bright and presently involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and thumbing through the papers
harry rosenfeld surveys the scene from his office doorway as woodward approaches hangs his coat at his desk not far from where rosenfeld is standing
wheres that cheery face weve come to know and love
you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarters tell me harry why should i be smiling
as usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly
chomps on some maalox tablets except a it wasnt local democratic headquarters it was national democratic headquarters woodward is surprised he hadnt known and b these werent just any idiots
these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at this morning they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying consults a piece of paper a walkie talkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pen sized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices
puts paper down not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse
nods two oclock work the phones til you go
woodward hurries along goes inside as we a corridor inside
woodward comes down it looks around sees a door marked counsels offices and heads toward it
now a clerk at a desk as woodward comes up
behind them two lawyers are clearly angry about something talking and gesticulating to each other
to the counsels could you give me the names of the lawyers for the men arrested in the watergate
these two were appointed indicates the angry men only now it turns out the burglars got their own counsel
he starts to laugh to clerk when you gonna stop thinking its so funny
to clerk we wouldda done a terrific job protecting those guys
neither lawyer by the way is clarence darrow you think were not as good as some hotshot fancy lawyer
the courtroom and business is booming
muggers pimp hookers their families and friends
in the scene that follows a constant counterpoint is whats going on up at the front as an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous night the aforementioned muggers
pimps and hookers are shuttled in given a quick appearance before a judge who sets bond and then shuttled out
in the audience one man stands out douglas caddy
he is extremely well dressed and obviously successful
beside him sits another smaller man who is unshaven and squints
woodward moves in sits alongside caddy
my names bob woodward im from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case im not here
nods he takes out a small notebook writes muttering aloud as he does
douglas caddy the attorney of record when questioned about his presence in the courtroom denied he was in the courtroom im not here mr
impatiently clearly i am here but only as an individual im not the attorney of record
indicating unshaven man mr
rafferty has that position
whatever you want youll have to get from him i have nothing more to say
and as he gets up walks off the water fountain in the corridor
there is a small line
caddy waits at the end of it
moving in behind him mr
rafferty was very helpful
four cuban americans and this other man james mccord
look i told you inside you have nothing more to say i understand that
caddy turns away woodward goes right on
what i dont understand is how you got here
i assure you theres nothing mysterious involved
probably youre right but a little while ago i was talking to a couple of lawyers whod been assigned to represent the burglars
well they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel
and that could only mean the burglars didnt arrange for their own counsel they never even made a phone call
looks at caddy so if they didnt ask for you to be here how did you know to come
without a word caddy turns leaves the line without getting a drink
silently woodward watches
now caddy seated as before beside rafferty
woodwards voice come from behind him and as caddy turns woodward is seated one row back
did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break in called you
turning there is no reason to assume other people were involved
your clients were arrested with a walkie talkie they didnt need that to talk among themselves
caddy looks at woodward turns back
turning back they are not my clients
youre a lawyer and youre here i met one of the defendants mr
barker at a social occasion once stops himself i have nothing more to say
leaning forward as caddy turns away again a miami social occasion
rafferty told me the cubans were from miami
sighing barkers wife called me at three this morning her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadnt called her by then
it was really nice of you to come since youd only met him once
are you implying you dont believe me
i have nothing more to say
you dont mind getting on peoples nerves do you
woodward considers this a moment
and on that word the courtroom as without warning it quiets
there is suddenly a tremendous air of expectancy you can feel it
now we see why as five men in dark business suits are led in theyve been stripped of belts ties and shoelaces
mccord is taller than the others
they stand facing the judge backs to the audience
woodward sits watching as the proceedings start but its hard to hear
he concentrates as the judge starts speaking
will you please state your professions
the five men do not move or reply
then after a long pause barker says anti communists
perplexed that sir is not your average occupation
woodward starts moving forward now down an aisle moving past kids and whores and all the rest trying to hear what the hells going on
at the front of the spectators section is a fence like wooden barricade about three feet high
as he approaches it the judge indicates the bald burglar
your name please
will you step forward sir
mccord obeys woodward at the bench is leaning forward trying to hear but its hard
and what is your occupation mr
softly security consultant
where in government
we cant really make this out central
he cant either where
clearing his throat the c
and on these words close up woodward leaning over the fence practically falling over it in a desperate straining effort to catch whats going on
stunned holy shit
now from the courtroom we are at the end of the press run the papers are all assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various places
as the papers continue to roll past a union type employee grabs a paper looks at the front page
the watergate story headlined whatever it was headlined is visible
the byline was by alfred e
the union type post employee glances at the article reading half aloud five men one of whom said he is a former employee
stops reading gives a shrug schmucks
and he turns happily to the sports section its new money and looks as if its been recently ironed
someone is going through the cash making a quick count
during this hurry it huh bachinski
you said i could look at it were in a room in a police station and two men are present
one a cop is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the door
the other bachinski is taking hurried notes in a reporters type notebook as he examines the evidence
i said look not memorize almost done give it a rest all right
and he looks at an address book he stops the address book
beside the name howard e
hunt is the notation w
now bachinski hurriedly opens the other book to the letter h and there is the same name howard e
hunt and beside it the letters w
whatd you find
these notebooks belonged to cuban guys
its gotta mean either white house or whore house one or the other
we hold on the hunt name and the address notations
then the phone rings waking him
he fumbles for the phone and the light finally gets them both
reaches for a notebook what
hold it gets it open starts to write ok go on go on
rosenfeld is opening them were in his office woodward sits across the desk holding the notebook we saw him writing in
go on go on
thats everything bachinski had i think its worth following up
dont know who the hells howard hunt
crunches tablets its probably nothing but check it out
just go easy it could be crazy cubans
howard simons sticks his head in the office
woodwards onto a new wrinkle with the break in thing absolute page one stuff in other words you got nothing youre thumbsucking
shrugs could develop
let me see what you get but dont jump the new york times thinks its crazy cubans
he moves on
rosenfeld turns quickly to woodward
ok get on this w
house guy and do a better job then you did on mccord
i did all right on mccord
then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr
mccord is security coordinator for the committee to re elect the president otherwise known as creep
getting it straight the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats
what the hell does that mean
hasnt the foggiest mr
john mitchell the head of creep says it means nothing
this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent
these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it
getting up you cant believe that
as a rough rule of thumb as far as i can throw bronco nagurski thats how much i trust john mitchell
now the newsroom as the triangle sound echoes
howard simons leaves large managing editors office walks past another office knocks twice on the glass wall
inside the executive editors office ben bradlee sits
as simons knocks he turns nods
he appears for the moment deep in thought
harry rosenfeld on the opposite end of the room hurries out of his office following a bunch of editors all of them heading across the huge room
as he passes woodwards desk rosenfeld pauses
whatd you get on w
massaging his neck lotsa hints not happy i cant sell hints to simons stops looks at piece of yellow paper you called everyone you know
woodward makes a nod call someone you dont know
woodward continues to rub his neck as rosenfeld hurries off all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon faced man intermittently rings the triangle
woodward picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk
lined legal sized it is crammed with names and numbers and addresses
they are in no neat order looking at them its almost like following a path chicken tracks in ink
woodward mutters to hell with it and reaches for a thick book flips it open
now we see the book its the washington phone directory and were in the ws
as woodwards finger stops we can see hes looking at the white house entry number
there it is just like your name and mine
now woodward starts to dial visibly nervous a fact he tries very hard to keep out of his voice tone
casually howard hunt please
throughout the following call we stay on woodwards face hear the other voices
hunt does not answer
woodward is delighted hes even there
thanks anyway and hes about to hang up when ill bet hes in mr
let me connect you
charles colsons wire
a little more excited howard hunt please
hunt isnt here just now
and hes about to hang up again when have you tried mullen and company public relations
he works at mullen and company public relations as a writer
the number is
im sorry i couldnt be more helpful
listen forget it
he hangs up sits there
his hands are a little twitchy
now rosenfeld hurrying he always hurries toward his office
woodward looking for something in his desk throughout this scene speaks to him
whos charles colson
stops dead i would liken your query to being in russia half a century ago and asking someone i understand who lenin is and trotsky i got too but whos
this yokel stalin
whos colson harry
the most powerful man in america is president nixon probably youve heard his name
woodward unfazed by anything continues to open drawers close them as rosenfeld rolls on
the second most powerful man is robert haldeman
just below him are a trio mr
erlichman is haldemans friend and they protect the president from everybody which is why they are referred to as either the german shepherds or the berlin wall
mitchell weve already discussed
colson is the presidents special counsel
rising thanks harry
looks at rosenfeld know anything about colson
just that on his office wall theres a cartoon with a caption reading when youve got them by the balls their hearts and minds will follow
woodward nods heads back toward the files as we woodward at his desk dialing the phone
hes got the colson file spread out now and we see pictures of the man and articles the post had done on him
but basically what we see is woodward plugging away on the goddamn phone and youd think his finger would fall off from all the dialing and you know his voice
is tiring as this montage goes on you can hear it grow raspy
but a lot of what a reporter does he does on the phone and thats what were compressing here
the dialing never stops the voices are continuous
hello im bob woodward of the washing post and
beat mullen and company public relations
could you tell me when you expect mr
surprised he is
howard hunt here
hi im bob woodward of the post and impatient yes yes what is it
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate
blind panic good god
and he bangs the phone down sharply more dialing sounds
now snatches of conversation im sorry to bother you mr
bennett but were doing some investigating of one of your employees howard hunt
well if youve been doing some investigating then obviously its no secret to you that howard was with the c
he hadnt known no secret at all
then tired voice deeper hello c
this is r
woodward of the washington post get me personnel dialing again
woodwards voice is showing genuine fatigue
hi im bob woodward of the washington post and whats that
youve never heard of me
i cant help that you dont believe im with the post
what do you want me to do madam shout extra extra
there is the sound of the phone being slammed down in his ear
now rosenfeld and simons approaching woodward who is working at his desk
he has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it
whaddya got whaddya got
hunt is colsons man to simons explaining thats charles colson nixons special counsel simons almost says something decides against it they both went to brown university consulting his notes hunt
worked for the c
till and this is on deep background the fbi thinks hes involved with the break in
what else have you got
according to white house personnel hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson
but when i called the white house press office they said he hadnt worked there for three months
then the p
guy said the weirdest thing to me
reading i am convinced that neither mr
colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of or participation in this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee
he looks up at them
isnt that what youd expect them to say
hes got something and he knows it i never asked them about watergate
i only said what were hunts duties at the white house
they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty
to simons i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging
nods just be careful how you write it
woodward typing like mad makes a mistake corrects it types on muttering to himself and rosenfeld in his office munching a handful of maalox tablets and woodward taking a sheet
from his typewriter hurrying off and rosenfeld taking the sheet from woodward heres the first take rosenfeld nods shows him out and woodward back at his machine typing faster then before makes another mistake starts to correct it glances around and rosenfeld in his office gesturing to somebody but not woodward and woodward watching as bernstein appears in view from behind the wide pillar by woodwards desk heads toward rosenfelds office
woodward shrugs goes back to his typing makes a typo immediately glances over toward rosenfelds office freezes as we rosenfeld handing some papers to bernstein
they look from this distance suspiciously like woodwards story
bernstein hurrying out of rosenfelds office and woodward watching bernstein until he disappears out of sight behind the pillar
woodward hesitates finally goes back to his typing makes another mistake fixes it makes still another his temper is shortly to make itself known rosenfeld as woodward hands him another
sheet of paper
this is all of it harry
rosenfeld nods takes it immediately starts to read as we woodward at his desk watching as rosenfeld gestures again
there is a pause
then bernstein appears from behind the pillar and rosenfeld handing bernstein another sheet of paper
berstein nods takes it walks back toward his desk disappears behind the pillar again
woodward is starting to steam
now bernstein at his desk typing magnificently his hands rising and falling like rubinsteins
behind him is the pillar and for a moment there is nothing then very slowly a figure peers out from behind the pillar it is woodward
bernstein continues to type then after a moment rests thinks shifts around in his chair and as his glance starts toward the pillar the pillar
woodward is gone
bernstein typing madly away
woodward is visible again eyes very bright
now bernstein finishing typing his hands moving majestically
woodward comes up behind him stands looking a second
then we have to talk
bernstein nods grabs the papers both that hes been typing and that hes been copying from
and as he rises woodward and bernstein walking silently out of the newsroom then turning left down a darker corridor passing bulletin boards and wall lockers and its all nice
and quiet as they amble on nodding to the few people they pass on their way and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge which is empty the walls are lined with norman rockwell reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are visible selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they are alone the silence ends
what the hell were you doing rewriting my story i sure couldnt hurt it could i
it was fine the way it was it was bullshit the way it was i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia
a sore subject what have you been here nine months
i been in this business since i was sixteen and youve had some fucking meteoric rise thats for sure by the time you turn forty you might be the head
of the montana bureau you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale bradlee went to harvard theyre all the same all those ivy league places they teach you about striped ties and suddenly youre smart im smart enough to know my story was solid mines better no way handing them over read em both and youll see and as woodward glances at the two stories bernstein watching
he glances from one story to the other
then disconsolately crap
and he sinks down in a chair
is mine better
handing the stories back what is it about my writing thats so rotten
as he exits mainly it has to do with your choice of words
and as he goes leaving woodward just sitting there berstein re entering the newsroom returning to his desk
he starts to insert some papers into his typewriter hesitates lights a cigarette
he inhales as behind him woodward briefly is visible going to his desk behind the pillar
finally bernstein inserts the paper starts to type as from behind the pillar carl
pushing his chair briefly into view fuck you carl
and as he rolls forward again out of sight its the june press conference
he talks on about something it doesnt matter exactly what here the point is it should include that strange smile of his that kept appearing when the man should not
have been smiling
hints of pressure maybe thats all and once its established woodward sitting alone gloomily staring at the set
were in the post cafeteria its the next morning and the place is pretty much empty
he sips the coffee it tastes rotten
bernstein moves up behind him carrying a cup of coffee of his own
he stands by woodward briefly
woodward glances up they put us both on the break in thing
simons liked the way we worked together
woodward nods bernstein sits down listen im sorry i said your story was bullshit
its ok im sorry i called you a failure
forget it the main thing stops did you call me a failure
i was sure trying
woodward bernstein and nixon
the way its shot its almost as if theyre watching each other nixon staring out from the tv set answering questions
woodward and bernstein sip coffee
we dont know yet or better they dont know it yet but these are our adversaries
woodward and bernstein without nixon now
they sit at the table
occasionally nixon is audible in the background
all right what do we know
let me lay a little theory on you cutting him off im not interested in theory
what do we know
for example hunts disappeared
well barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the air conditioning system
and mccord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the democratic convention
to bernstein the times has got to be full of it it cant be crazy cubans
points to nixon it cant be the republicans hed never allow something as stupid as this not when hes gonna slaughter mcgovern anyway
nixon didnt get where he got by being dumb stops abruptly listen that was a watergate question nixon on the tube
the white house has had no involvement whatever in this particular incident
woodward and bernstein staring at the set thinking
woodward and bernstein walking toward bersteins desk
what do you think he meant this particular incident
were there others
how would we find out
you know anyone important
sits shakes his head i lived here all my life i got a million contacts but theyre all bus boys and bellhops
the reporter ken ringle at the next desk watches them a moment
then what do you need
someone inside the white house would be nice
writes down phone number call her
she worked for colson if thats any help
as bernstein grabs for the phone bernstein is talking off to one side with an attractive girl
kennys crazy i never worked for colson i worked for an assistant
colson was big on secrets anyway
even if i had worked for him i wouldnt have known anything
nothing at all you can remember
pause now if it was hunt you were interested in howard hunt
him i liked he was a very nice person
secretive too traveled all over but a decent man
any idea what he did
oh the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy teddy kennedy
i remember seeing a book about chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the white house library and the library of congress and and as
she goes on quickly bernstein is at his desk telephoning
woodward stands alongside
white house library please
we hear the other end of this phone call clearly
elderly sounding lady library
carl bernstein of the washington post
i was just wondering if you remember the names of any of the books that howard hunt checked out on senator kennedy
i think i do remember he took out a whole bunch of material
let me just go see
sound of the phone being laid down
what do you think
hunt doesnt seem like your ordinary consultant
maybe a political operative of some sort a spy you mean
it makes sense hunt worked for the c
and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy
what i said before
i was wrong
the truth is i dont have a card that mr
hunt took out any kennedy material
woodward and bernstein listen and now there is something in her voice that wasnt there before fear i remember getting that material out for somebody but it wasnt mr
the truth is ive never had any requests at all from mr
beat the truth is i dont know mr
there is the sound of the phone being dropped into its cradle
bernstein continues to hold his
he and woodward just look at each other
now now as woodward and bernstein get out of a cab start inside you want all the material requested by the white house
woodward and bernstein standing there
one of them maybe says yessir the other maybe please
the librarian moves out of his office into a corridor
they go with him
no one else is around
the librarian looks at them quickly all white house transactions are confidential
and just like that hes back into his office and as he shuts the door woodward and bernstein walking along through the library of congress
you think they are confidential
i dont know anything about how this town works i havent lived here a year yet
we need a sympathetic face
on the word face a bearded young looking clerk
were in the reading room of the library and woodward and bernstein are with him
you want every request since when
to woodward when did hunt start at the white house
about the past year
starts to smile im not sure you want em but i got em
now woodward and bernstein seated at a table with from anywhere between to thousand slips of paper
in front of them seated at a high desk the bearded clerk looks down on them shaking his head
its a staggering amount of work to thumb through
i cant believe you guys are actually doing this
to the clerk you do a lot of things when youre on a story
to bernstein quietly can you believe were actually doing this
bernstein cant now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through the slips it took them hours and hours and the afternoon darkened as they
and theyre tired
now woodward and bernstein getting back into a cab
that was fun
slams the door what now
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion
stunned and you havent called him
as the taxi pulls off reading an article by bernsteins desk
woodward sits on an adjacent desk
to bernstein you got accurate notes on the white house librarian
bernstein nods ok well leave space for the white house denial and we should be set
suddenly he gestures and we bradlee standing across the room
without a nod he moves toward rosenfeld
woodward and bernstein nervously watching bradlee come
as soon as bradlee is within earshot rosenfeld starts his sell
benjy we got a present for you
above the fold on page one for sure
it may not change our lives one way or the other
just a good solid piece of american journalism beat that the new york times doesnt have
bradlee by this time has taken the story grabbed an unoccupied chair sat down started to read
his only response to rosenfeld is an intermittent uh huh uh huh
woodward and bernstein watching as the silence goes on
he wants the story too but he doesnt want it like woodward and bernstein do
they were as they said proud of their work
the silence goes on
finally bradlee looks up
you havent got it
before they can reply a librarian and a secretary say hunt looked at a book
shakes his head not good enough
he begins editing the piece slashing paragraphs out of it
i was told by this guy at the white house that hunt was investigating teddy kennedy
edgy you asking me to disclose my source
other reporters are watching now
bradlee is impatient as always
just tell me his title
i dont know titles
is he on the level of assistant to the president or not
woodward doesnt know
bradlee continues to hack at their piece
done he stands walks away
get some harder information next time
woodward and bernstein watch him go they are embarrassed angry crushed
hold on their faces
then he is in pajamas and lugging a flower pot out to the balcony positioning it so it would be visible to anyone passing in the alley below
he takes a stick with a red flag jams it into the flower pot
hes nervous and he makes several adjustments making sure the red flag is secure and wont fall
woodward down in the alley staring up at his apartment
the flag is clearly visible
he checks his watch hurries out of the alley
deserted except for a few older front page types reporters whose legs have given out playing cards in a corner of the room
woodward is working at his desk until he glances up at a wall clock
its almost one on the button and as he rises woodward racing down the stairway of the post as he hits the lobby he turns and we woodward appears in
the side exit walks off
when he gets out of sight of the paper he starts to run
now woodward turning a corner running on
up ahead is a cab woodward in the cab sitting forward tensely
occasionally various monuments are briefly visible lit up in the b
woodward takes out some money as we the cab stopping
woodward pays gets out
the cab pulls away
when it is out of sight woodward starts to run again
a street as woodward runs by
its not the nicest area in the world
he is going faster now
a cab gassing up at a station
woodward hurries to it gets in and the second cab roaring along some washington streets
woodward inside the cab
he looks at his watch tries not to seem nervous
but his fingers are drumming drumming and the second cab stopping as woodward gets out pays
the cab starts off but slowly
the cab doesnt turn as the first one did
woodward still waits
finally the cab turns and the second it does woodward starts to run again and woodward turning a corner running on and another corner as woodward turns it finally stops
and catches his breath as we woodward entering the garage
its an eerie place and his heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy yes hes edgy
he comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels hesitates
it seems to descend forever
woodward starting down
hold on him as he walks
down he goes the shadows deepening then disappearing then covering him again
he continues on
he must be at least at the first underground level now but he doesnt stop and we dont stop watching him as he continues to go down turning the sound
of his shoes softer now and hes a smaller figure as we watch him circle around and around until we another level underground
a few cars parked here and there
woodward hesitates on the ramp looks around
dark dark eerie
woodward quietly stepping off the ramp continuing to glance this way that way
now nothing unusual about that
but then some cigarette smoke appears trailing up and disappearing from between the cars
as woodward moves forward a man sitting on his haunches between the cars smoking
he leans with his back against the wall
i saw the flag signal whats up
nothing thats the problem the storys gone underground
you thought id help out on specifics
headshake ill confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but thats all
looks at woodward are you guys really working
woodward nods how much
i dont know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a day weve got sources at justice the fbi but its still drying up
then there must be something mustnt there
look forget the myths the medias created about the white house the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand
if you dont like them why wont you be more concrete with me
because the press stinks too history on the run thats all youre interested in
inhales you come up with anything
john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family
that doesnt exactly have the ring of truth
deep throat nods howard hunts been found there was talk that his lawyer had thousand in cash in a paper bag
follow the money
always follow the money
shakes his head no go on
this man gordon liddy hes going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglars we know he knows a lot we just dont know what
lights a new cigarette you changed cabs
youre sure no one followed you
i did everything you said but it all seemed melodramatic
headshakes things are past that remember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city
whats the whole thing about do you know
what i know youll have to find out on your own
liddy you think theres a chance hell talk
once at a gathering he put his hand over a candle
and he kept it there
he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared
a woman who was watching asked whats the trick
and he replied
the trick is not minding
deep throat shakes his head walks off
woodward stands alone now watching
now the shadows have the other man
just his footsteps are audible
woodward stands there
its morning and hes struggling to get his bike down the steps of his apartment building
woodward driving up in his two year old red karmann ghia
he roars up alongside bernstein waving a folded up newspaper
the fucking new york times
the times spread somewhat tentatively over a mailbox
a small headline is visible with the words barker liddy and telephone in some kind of order
woodward and bernstein look at it the best they can
im trying fifteen phone calls fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep why didnt we get that
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company you do
with access to records
as bernstein nods a guy shells peanuts
bernstein hurries up
why couldnt you have just dialed me from the office irwin
cause im not calling out from the phone company anymore drops his voice i think the place is bugged
taking some peanuts so tell me about the times article
what do you want to know
no games irwin give
looks at bernstein my big civil rights buddy shakes his head boy if john mitchell was after your phone records would you be screaming
eats whatre you onto
something maybe big
and that makes anything you do ok is that it
just tell me about the goddamn article
shelling away it was accurate but i cant get a fuller listing for you all barkers phone records have been subpoenaed
a miami d
the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis
finishes his peanuts starts off irwin
i really feel bad doing something like this you know that dont you
irwin looks at bernstein for a long time
then dont give me any more of your liberal shit ok carl
he walks off doesnt look back
now at the water fountain on the th floor
he chews up a few maalox tablets notices bernstein steaming up
harry i just talked to a miami investigator about barker so
i think it might be helpful if youd send me to miami
rosenfeld heads for his office bernstein pursuing
im the one sent you to toronto bernstein trying to head him off that was awhile ago i think it might be helpful if youd send me to toronto
that was your spiel then
the lifestyles of deserters
whirls on bernstein im still waiting for it
he enters his office bernstein follows
down to miami and back how much damage can i do
youre the fella who forgot he rented a hertz car do i have to tell you they didnt forget to send us the bill
and he looks unsympathetically at bernstein simons circling around the th floor
rosenfeld falls into step
they keep moving throughout
i can predict the next words youre gonna say anyone but bernstein
simons gestures for rosenfeld to continue i want to send a reporter to miami
anyone but bernstein
howard remember toronto harry
that was awhile ago
i dont get it you were the one who wanted to fire him
i know i did but damnit howard simons looks at him for the first time since ive known him i think hes really humping
he is busy doing two things at once studying notebooks and packing
music plays lovely stuff the bach brandenburgs
as the phone rings answering yeah
pause yes this is carl bernstein
stunned youre repossessing my bicycle
softer listen im sure i paid this months installment so why dont you check your records before you go around hassling people
and as he stands there an attractive efficient looking woman of bernsteins age
she has just entered the apartment
vivaldi is playing now
hannah i never would have bothered you but im off to miami and theyre gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast
glancing around the chaos where are your bills carl
oh theyre here
starts lifting debris from his desk im keeping much better records now hannah
grabbing a big manila envelope see
hands it to her looks inside carl its a jungle
sits at his desk takes out a mass of papers glancing at the top bill i suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles
studies another bill youd give a stranger the shirt off your back except it wouldnt be paid for
he smiles gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances
nods lot of pressure at the star
looking at the bills carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt when we split you were solvent
that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this
sighs how much did the damn bike cost
five hundred six maybe
looking at paper youre two months behind you got enough to cover
give me your checkbook then
its right under that pile
he indicates a mound of papers
she pulls it out as he continues to massage her more sensually now
she reaches back puts her hand on his
i thought you had to get to miami
theres always a later plane
youre a sex junkie you know that carl
more rubbing now im glad youre out of it hannah youre a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper
hannah looks at bernstein a moment then she smiles gently shakes her head
aw baby you can get it up
i just wonder if youll ever be able to get it together
and quickly from that seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office
outside palm trees were in miami
and judging from the number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench bernsteins been there a while
and maybe he never will be able to get it together who knows
at the front a secretary sits filing her nails
behind her are a number of closed doors to offices
no one passes without her ok
the clock hits three in the afternoon as bernstein gets up from the bench goes to the secretary
hi its me
im still here
couldnt be nicer im so glad
id really like to see mr
and you will
smiles but not now
i called him from washington
hes the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
i told you he had to go out on a case
the bench as bernstein slumps back down
he wipes his forehead with his sleeve smokes a fresh cigarette is kind of interested when a uniformed cop walks up to the secretary who is now putting red polish
on her nails
is it ok to go on back
bernstein watching as the cop walks past the secretary enters an office behind
bernstein approaching the secretary again
she is working on her right hand now
could you reach mr
dardis by car radio
he is not in the car
smiles shes just so understanding sorry
another uniformed cop walking by the secretarys desk
he enters the same office the first cop did
he lights another cigarette puts it out then lights another
finishing her manicure
it is almost five oclock now
bernstein his bench a sea of cigarette butts slowly gets up and goes to the secretary
dardis does call in every so often
well of course
just tell him i was here that im sorry i missed him he walks out the double doors
bernstein in hallway
he looks down the hall
at the end opposite the secretarys reception room is a big glass door with a sign reading office of the dade county clerk
bernstein goes into a phone booth in the corridor from which he can see both offices
he puts in a dime and dials
dardis office please
the phone rings and she punches the button on the phone console
bernstein in phone booth
this is mr
tomlinson in the clerks office
could you come across the hall for a moment
weve got some documents your boss probably should see
he hangs up
bernstein watching from phone booth as the secretary hurries across the hallway
as we see her open the door of the clerks office bernstein bolts out of the phone booth and runs into the reception room heading straight for the secretarys desk
bernstein at her desk looking at the telephone console receiver in hand
he punches the button marked intercom and we can hear it buzz somewhere
carl bernsteins here to see you i dont know why but he seems angry dardis emerging through one of the doors behind bernstein
bernstein see him
to dardis look youve been jerking my chain all day
if theres some reason you cant talk to me like the fact that youve already leaked everything to the new york times just say so
listen ive got a dinner cant we do this tomorrow
headshake im on deadline
he is fiddling with a combination lock at a filing cabinet
bernstein is seated across dardis desk
you want barkers phone stuff or his money stuff
he hands bernstein some papers glances at his watch
ill never get out of here in time
flying through what hes been handed the telephone calls
we know about that
the rest is barkers bank records
its mostly the eighty nine thousand in mexican cashiers checks yeah that was in the times this morning
bernstein continues to fly through the papers
continuing stops whats this dahlberg check
and as its mentioned close up cashiers check
its drawn on the first bank and trust company of boca raton florida its dated april and its for thousand dollars payable to the order to kenneth h
that the twenty five grand one
dont know bernstein starting to copy the check in a meticulous facsimile
i never could figure just who this dahlberg was
watching bernstein think it might be anything
and from here quickly bernstein in a phone booth in the lobby of the justice building
wildly excited woodward woodward listen i dont know what i got holding the dahlberg facsimile and i think the times has it too big but somewhere theres a kenneth h
dahlberg in this world and weve gotta find him and now comes this is a compressed montage sequence in which we cut from one reporter to the other both of
them desperately trying to locate a man names dahlberg
woodward is maybe in the reference room of the post sweating surrounded by whos who and dictionary of american biographies and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities bernstein
is maybe in the phone booth of the justice building sweating with a pile of dimes as he dials away
this took them hours and that effort should be visible to us
they tire grow punchy but they keep on checking phone book and dialing numbers and god knows what else
the point is we want to get to dahlberg in a reasonably short amount of time but we also want people to know there was effort involved
woodward bleary in the reference room a girl comes in a researcher librarian type
were you after the dahlberg articles from the files
woodward nods there arent any sorry
and now she drops a piece of paper a photo whazzis
shrugs our dahlberg file
as she leaves the photo
it is a picture of hubert humphrey standing next to another man
the caption identifies that other man as kenneth dahlberg
now the room is reasonably quiet
rosenfeld is visible in his office
as woodward picks up the phone gets minneapolis information rosenfelds phone ringing
he hurries in grabs it
harry i know how to get dahlberg woodwards talking to him know
there are no dimes left
he listens a moment more then nods hangs up leans back against the glass takes a deep breath closes his eyes as we woodward on the phone
this should take only a minute mr
dahlberg but were doing a follow up on the break in pause and i was kind of curious about your check
the twenty five thousand dollar one
silence the one with your name on it
silence in bernard barkers florida account
still nothing bernard barker the watergate burglar struggling youre definitely doing a story
im a proper citizen im a decent man i dont do anything that isnt decent or proper
woodward waits pen ready tense as hell i know i shouldnt tell you this
woodwards lips are going tell me tell me
that twenty five thousand dollars is money i collected for nixon in this years campaign
and how do you think it reached miami
i dont know i really dont
the last time i saw it was when i was in washington
i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re elect the president
how it got to that burglar your guess is as good as mine
trying to keep his voice level that checks out with our finding thank you mr
rosenfeld holds it
creep financed the watergate break in jesus christ
he starts off
one sec woodward takes the story scrawls bernsteins name in front of his on the byline
as woodward finishes he takes the story again hurries off
now campaign funds found in watergate burglars account
now that it isnt exactly a gigantic headline piece
as a matter of fact as more and more of page one appears we see that their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and bigger headlines
are visible the whole first page
plastered across the top in giant letters is the following eagleton resigns
and as you look at the whole page now you can barely make out the tiny piddling watergate story
the point is abundantly clear nobody cared a whole lot
being rung like crazy
and as it sounds ok last go round
foreign anything else
the foreign editor an enormously thoughtful looking and respected man indicates no
to another editor national
ill stand with the eagleton follow ups and mcgovern not being able to get a replacement thats your page one stuff right there howard metropolitan
you are ignoring the importance of the dahlberg repercussions nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions to national editor quit equivocating say what you mean to simons and bradlee
our story got government accounting to start an audit on creeps finances and we printed that didnt we harry
and when the frigging audits done well print that too let me tell what happened when i was having lunch today at the sans souci correction when you were drinking
your lunch at the bar of the sans souci this white house guy a good one a pro came up and asked what is this watergate compulsion with you guys and i said well we think its important and he said if its so goddamn important who the hell are woodward and bernstein
ask him what hes really saying he means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk well ive got some pretty experienced
fellas sitting around wouldnt you say so
absolutely and thats all they do sit sit sit every once in a while they call up a senator some reporting well what if your boys get it wrong after
a beat then its our asses isnt it
indicates the meeting is over and well all have to go to work for a living
as the men rise and head for the door the foreign editor moves toward bradlee and simons who remain seated as before
i dont think either metropolitan or national should cover the story
bradlee and simons look at him i dont think we should cover the story period
its not that were using unnamed sources that bothers me or that everything we print the white house denies or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff
i dont believe the goddamn story howard it doesnt make sense
it will it just hasnt bottomed out yet give it time
ben jesus there are over two thousand reporters in this town are there five on watergate
where did we suddenly get all this wisdom
bradlee and simons say nothing
they respect this guy
look why would the republicans do it
my god mcgovern is self destructing before our eyes just like muskie did humphrey the bunch of em
sits on the table talks quietly on why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught
why did they take a walkie talkie and then turn it off unless they wanted to get caught
why would they use mccord the only direct contact to the republicans
you saying the democrats bugged themselves
the fbi thinks its possible the democrats need a campaign issue corruptions always a good one
rises starts out get off the story ben or put some people on mcgoverns finances fair is fair even in our business
bradlee and simons stay where they are both of them flattened by what the guys said
because theyre not sure hes wrong
now were back with the union guy from before
he pulls out a paper again looks at a story on the front page the woodward bernstein story that said the gao found that creep has mishandled over in campaign
to another union guy whos reading over his shoulder whatdya think
politics as usual someone just got caught with his hand in the cookie jar thats all
hes not so sure big fuckin cookie jar
as he turns to the sports section either they get it as it is now or as they really did from a post researcher who knew someone
in ant case we see the list with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices and phone extensions
we also see the two of them working first making long attempts at figuring out who worked for whom at creep
then once they have that they begin using the cross reference phone books which are not familiar to moviegoers
and from these they begin to get the home addresses of the various small fry people who work for creep
near the end alphabetically there is a common female name jane smith or something like that
as bernstein runs his finger down the addresses something strikes him as familiar and as he reaches for the phone bernstein enters looks around then smiles and moves to a
lovely girl with a sweet face who probably weighs pounds
she is sitting alone in a corner booth
she nods to bernstein cant quite pull off a smile
sits across this is practically a high school reunion for us jane i would have sprung for a classier place
anyplace really public theyd know about it they know everything at the committee carl you dont really think youre being followed
this girlfriend of mine at the committee the other day she went back to the d
to tell the things the fbi didnt ask her
that night her boss he knew what shed done
they control everything thats how they know it all
you dont believe me
well i was working the weekend of the break in and my god all the executives were running around like crazy you had to practically wait in line to use
the shredding machine and when the fbi came to investigate they never even asked me about it
if you dont like it down there why dont you quit
i dont know what theyd do to me
reaching over hey easy
headshake were a long way from high school carl
she looks at him and im scared
hold on her frightened face a moment
then riding home on his bicycle
he gets to his building starts lugging it up when they found out i saw you bernstein stops glances around they wanted to know everything
louder dont call me again
moving toward her voice i can help if youll stay away from me carl
jane in the darkness
if she was scared earlier its panic time now
she turns hurries off
bernstein watches her
suddenly a sound comes from the darkness behind him
it was nothing but from the way he jumped when it happened you can tell the fear is spreading
now from washington in darkness woodward comes hurrying along and as he enters the hotel a desk clerk shaking his head at woodward
we have no one by the name of mitchell registered
my mistake sorry
and as he goes woodward out on the street in a phone booth near essex house
get me john mitchell its urgent
that would be room ill connect you
woodward waits anxiously as the connection is made
can i speak to martha mitchell please
who is this
ive met mrs
mitchell in washington im bob woodward of the post and tell her and the phone clicks dead an elevator the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises
woodward stands alone in the elevator
as it reaches seven and the doors slide open he steps out and the marriott suite
woodward approaches but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls knocks on the door nearest him
now is wide open and several maids leave watched by a large black man
well be back after lunch
its the voice from the phone well be here
woodward waits by his door as slowly closes
the maids look at him a moment
he knocks again louder
i think they went out
shrugs i dont mind waiting
the maids nod move out of sight
woodward stands tense and still watching the closed door numbered
now people are getting off the shuttle woodward among them
as woodward reaches him see her
woodward nods get anything
for the paper no for us plenty
the two of them head for the terminal i waited a long time and finally this big guy i guess a bodyguard he left and i knocked and she remembered
me we talked awhile
looks at bernstein she was panicked carl every time i mentioned watergate you could tell
were you eyebrow reading
shakes his head no it was there
i just dont get it a creep secretary being scared thats one thing
but what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in america have to be afraid of
they look at each other neither has a clue
now moving along a residential area in washington
its later that night
inside the car night
woodward and bernstein driving along
left up ahead
alphabetically on the creep phone list miss helen abbott of south george street
as woodward turns left
now hang your second right explaining this was my turf when i was a kid
and on those words a dead end sign
we hear bernstein explaining i brought you over one street too many go back and hang a left again
now on those words woodward and bernstein pulled over to one side
bernstein baffled stares around woodward looks at a map with the aid of a flashlight
i dont get it
this really was my turf
concentrating on the map youre not a kid anymore
shaking his head my first day as a copy boy i was sixteen and wearing my only grown up suit it was cream colored
at the head copy boy comes running up to me and says my god havent you washed the carbon paper yet
if its not washed by three itll never by dry for tomorrow
woodward is getting interested in the story now and i said am i supposed to do that
and he said absolutely its crucial
so i run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the mens room
im standing there washing it and its splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak and he says what the fuck do you think youre
and i said its
im washing the carbon paper
bernstein looks at just wanted you to know ive done dumber things than get us lost thats all
woodward goes back to his map
bernstein continues to smoke staring around at the night
woodward at the front of a house
a sweet old lady is looking out at him
im bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home i already get the post
i dont need another subscription
no im a reporter
i wanted to talk to you about the committee to re elect
the what to what
you work there miss abbott
im not miss abbott
another lady in her doorway
this time both woodward and bernstein are there
were from the washington post and we wanted to ask you some questions about the committee
im sorry and from nowhere suddenly she bursts into tears
woodward and bernstein as her door slams in their faces
they just look at each other bewildered
and a little bit upset their upset increases as the rejections go on
in quick succession theyre all in various doorways men women young old
the only thing in common is their fear
literally trembling god its just so awful and as he closes the door i cant id like to but thats all shell say and as her door starts to shut
go youve got to go before they see you please and as he almost starts to beg no
she stands there shaking her head back and forth back and forth pathetic and sad
now he is seated alone staring at his coffee cup surrounded by junk food debris
we are in a hot shoppe its night and as bernstein comes up with food theyre dressed differently from before
bernstein puts more junk food and coffee down
you had the mighty mo and the fries without gravy right
woodward shrugs bernstein passes over some food
they both look bleary and in foul moods
silently they start to eat something they continue doing throughout
theyre not hungry they just eat
this is terrific work if you like rejection
i never scared anyone before
its not us they were scared before we got there
looks at bernstein what do we know
facts or theory
anything youve got
we know theres got to be something or they wouldnt be so panicked
and that somethings got to be more than just hunt liddy and the five burglars those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down
what else do we know
i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us thats all
the continue to eat bleary and numb as we kind of an honest hard working face
woodward and bernstein are standing in her doorway
a friend at the committee told us to contact you who was it
we never reveal our sources which is why you can talk to us
its safe try it youll see
she doesnt talk at first but she doesnt slam the door either
we understand your problem you believe in the president you wouldnt ever want to do anything disloyal
we appreciate your position really
and now she starts at last to talk and they expect it to be their first breakthrough but when it turns out to be the most withering onslaught yet they
you people you think that you can come into someones life squeeze what you want then get out
to bernstein you dont appreciate a goddamn thing mister
to woodward and you dont understand nothing
voice rising but the committees briefed us on you so get the hell out of here big do you like scaring the life out of decent people
cause if you dont in the name of god stop it
and she slams the door woodward and bernstein slowly walking back in silence back to the car
at yale once they held an auction
there was this woman and her name was lulu landis
her postcards came up for sale
she had postcards written to her and id never heard of her before but i knew i had to have those cards i had to know why anyone would get
so many messages
i paid sixty five dollars for them
i got all crazy trying to work it out and first it was just a maze but then i found that her husband killed himself in dayton and once i
had that it all began to open an evangelist had come to dayton and his horses hit lulu landis at the corner of th and vermillion and she was paralyzed
permanently and her favorite thing til then had been traveling and all her friends whenever they went anyplace they wrote her
those cards they were her eyes
they continue to walk slowly
i know who you are and im not afraid but that dont mean ill talk to you either youre just a couple democrats out to stop nixon getting re elected
woodward and bernstein staring at the man
i hate both parties
and im a republican
the middle aged man looks at him
surprised turns to republican
whod you vote for
bernstein stares at him in silence as we only they arent slamming doors theyre sitting in various rooms of their houses and apartments
we dont see the reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive make it self evident
we start with the middle aged man seen above
mitchell never left the committee he resigned sure but he was there as much as before oh dont worry gordon liddy will be happy to take the fall for everyone
because well its not that gordons crazy hes
pauses looking for the right word weird
ill give you some committee people who know about him only dont tell it was me of course we were briefed on what to say and never to volunteer anything
oh we were never alone with the fbi there was always someone from the committee right there smiles talks on as we no one in this administration presently employed was involved in this very bizarre incident
bernstein and woodward in a crummy cafeteria watching the evening news on the tv set high on the wall
woodward eats a hamburger bernstein smokes sips coffee
it is night as usual now
nixon on the tube
what really hurts in matters of this sort is not the fact that they occur because overzealous people in campaigns do things that are wrong
what really hurts is if you try to cover it up
woodward and bernstein as the news commentator come on begins introducing another story
did he just say what i think he said
you voted for him
he gives woodward a big smile
woodward eats his hamburger in silence
bernstein gets out of his car walks up and knocks on the door of a small tract house in the d
a woman opens the door
hi im carl bernstein of the washington post and oh you dont want me you want my sister
calls out for you
and we the bookkeeper approaching the door
shes younger than the cliche version of a bookkeeper
as she looks at her sister this here is carl bernstein omigod youre from that place youve got to go
the sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette table
could i bum one of your cigarettes
as the sister starts for the pack dont bother ill get it
and he crosses ten feet inside the front door
youve really got to go
just let me get a match
he goes into the living room area picks up a book of matches
this whole scene moves slowly the tension building under it its not like news people talking nothing overlaps here
but i want you to know that i understand why youre afraid a lot of good people down there at the committee are afraid
im really sorry for what youre being put through
all those articles you people write where do you find that stuff
we dont tell anyone that
which is why you can talk to us
and if we cant verify what you say someplace else we dont print it
thats another reason you can relax
tense im relaxed light your cigarette
bernstein lights the cigarette
you were hugh sloans bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance and we were sort of wondering did you go work for stans immediately after sloan quit or
was there a time lapse
i never worked for sloan or stans
out of the blue to would you like some coffee or anything
as the bookkeeper winces
like a shot please yes thank you
he looks at the can i sit down for a minute
he is by a couch
one minute but then right right ive got to go
he sits why did you lie just then
the bookkeeper kneads her hands together silently
i was just curious you dont do it well so i wondered
have you been threatened if you told the truth is that it
never in so many words
gently its obvious you want to talk to someone well im someone
he takes out his notebook
and she does want to talk
but the notebook scares her terribly and she can only stare at it
im not even going to put your name down
its just so i can keep things straight
beat start with the money why dont you
returning with coffee how do you like it
going again i wont be a minute
to the bookkeeper quietly the general accounting report said there was a thousand cash slush fund in stans safe
did you know about that from the beginning
about to fold there are too many people watching me they know i know a lot it was all in hundreds wasnt it
a lot of it was
i just thought it was sort of an all purpose political fund you know for taking fat cats to dinner things like that
could buy a lot of steaks dollars
her words are coming faster i cant be positive that it was used for the break in but people sure are worried
the ones who could disburse the money
who were they
there were a group of them i think five i dont know their names
sloan knew which five didnt he
she nods back with cream and sugar here we are
i dont want to say anymore
indicating coffee its awfully hot smiles and you havent finished telling me about the money long pause then in a burst omigod there was so much of it six million
came in one two day period six million cash we couldnt find enough places to put it
i thought it was all legal i guess i did til after the break in when i remembered gordon got so much of it
heart starting to pound gordon liddy you mean
nods it was all so crazy the day after the break in he gave us a speech bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his
gordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everything dont let one bad apple spoil the barrel he said
you just know that when gordon liddys calling someone a bad apple somethings wrong somewhere
more and more moved now its all so rotten
and getting worse
and all i care about is hugh sloan
his wife was going to leave him if he didnt stand up and do what was right
and he quit
he quit because he saw it and didnt want any part of it
think sloans being set up as a fall guy for john mitchell
sometimes it looks that way
there is a pause
then if you guys
if you guys could just get john mitchell
that would be beautiful
and now as long last she begins to cry
hold on her tears then clicking away
the words interview with x
there is music in the background really blasting away rachmaninoff or worse
we are in woodwards apartment and bernstein is dictating notes from the bookkeeper interview
its very late and bernstein has notes on everything matchboxes and its hard for him to read
theyre both really excited bernstein from his coffee jag woodward by what bernsteins dictating
i couldnt believe what she told me
eight cups of coffee worth
go on go on weve got to find out who the five guys are the five with access to the slush fund they were aware of the break in
then tomorrows grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
it goes very high weve got to find out where we will she was really paranoid the bookkeeper
that happens to people
he goes over turns the hi fi on even louder
shouts ok go on
the noise blasts away as bernstein and woodward hunch over the typewriter
its a moment of genuine exhilaration
paranoid sure but for the first time theyre really on to something its all starting to split open
they are driving through mclean virginia a development of identical imitation tudor houses
how do you want to handle sloan
you mean whos going to play the mean m
and whos going to be the nice one
bernstein nods woodward shrugs whichever
hes another ivy leaguer so hell probably expect you to be understanding might surprise him if youre not
you want me to be the bastard
nods and ill just shitkick in my usual way
as they drive on a pretty young woman standing in the doorway of one of the tudor houses
she is very pregnant
she knows instinctively who they are and she dominates them in a genuinely proud female way
what i mean is its her scene and theyre suddenly embarrassed to be bothering her
to see mr
there is a pause
she studies them youre those two from the post arent you
they nod ill tell him
as shes about to step back inside this must be a difficult time for the both of you
this is an honest house
thats why we wanted to see your husband
she studies them still more silence
that decision is up to him
conspiratorially maybe you could put in a good word
weve got another appointment tonight in this area well just stop back later all right
its a free country beat in theory
they nod start back down the walk
she watches them
calling out be careful they turn look back at her
you can destroy lives
woodward and bernstein watching her
she seems like a terrific girl
and maybe theyve upset her
or maybe what she has said coming from her has more impact than otherwise
quietly they turn back walk in silence toward the red karmann ghia
the mclean mcdonalds dinnertime
lots of very noisy happy children
woodward and bernstein sit surrounded by their usual array of junk food
think sloans back
bernstein seems lost in thought whats wrong
nothing i just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am
sips coffee i never like it when the other guys human
they continue to sip coffee outside it continues to rain
now a young slender guy answering his door
woodward and bernstein stand outside their jackets over their heads protecting themselves from the rain which is harder now
nods my wife told me to expect you
softly as you know i havent talked to the press
we were hoping that maybe now you could
we know why you left the committee
we know youre not guilty of anything
but we know you know who is it has begun to rain even harder
look come in
well have to be quiet my wifes asleep
a christmas card from the nixons they are standing in front of the white house christmas tree
it is signed to hugh and debbie sloan with thanks richard m
nixon patricia nixon
and were in the living room
more coffee is being drunk sloan endlessly stirs his
id like to talk to you i really would but my lawyers say i shouldnt until after the watergate trial
you handed out the money
maybe theres a legitimate explanation for the way it was done then again maybe things are even worse than weve written theyre worse
thats why i quit
woodward and bernstein wait as sloan is clearly going through a struggle with himself
then try and understand this
im a decent republican
i believe in richard nixon
i worked in the white house four years so did my wife
what happened on june i dont think the president knew anything about
some of his men im not so sure of
do you think the truth will come out at the trial
thats another of the things im not so sure of
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors
we were never told flat out dont talk
but the message was clear
to cover up
well they sure didnt ask us to come forward and tell the truth
does they mean the white house
as opposed to the committee
the committees not an independent operation
everything is cleared with the white house
i dont think that the fbi or the prosecutors understand that
the report on the cash in maurice stans safe the three hundred fifty thousand thats true
it was closer to seven hundred thousand
and as treasurer you could release those funds
nods when so ordered
were not sure weve got all the guys who could order you but we know there were five
sloan is silent ticking them off mitchell stans magruder theyre obvious sloan stirs his coffee
there had to be a white house overseer colson
colsons too smart to get directly involved with something like that
to bernstein haldeman
to sloan right
i wont talk about the other two
but they both worked at the white house
softly i will not talk about the other two
out of the blue kalmbach nixons personal lawyer
sloan is shocked at the mention of kalmbach
i cant say anything im sorry
he starts to rise one thing im not completely clear on when you gave out the money to liddy how did that work
and now for the first time he almost smiles you dont realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered i gave liddy the dahlberg check and he gave it
to barker who took it to miami and deposited it
then barker withdrew the thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to liddy who gave it back to me and i put it in the office safe which
well when liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break in funds i went to the safe and gave him out of this whole
fortune i happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me banks have to keep track of hundreds
if the money had been in fifties or if id grabbed a different stack there probably wouldnt have been any watergate story
ordinarily though what was the procedure
routine id just call john mitchell over at the justice department and hed say go ahead give out the money
woodward and bernstein just look at each other they hadnt known it not remotely
sloan stands and as they head for the door the three of them heading across the foyer
what happens when the baby comes
beat ive been looking for a job but its been
my names been in the papers too much
sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence
im not thinking of myself
but my wife my parents its been very rough on them
bernstein and woodward looking very uncomfortable as sloan goes on
i wish i could put down on paper what its like you come to washington because you believe in something and then you get inside and you see how things
actually work and you watch your ideals disintegrate
beat the people inside the people in the white house they start to believe they can suspend the rules because theyre fulfilling a mission
that becomes the only important thing the mission
its so easy to lose perspective
we want to get out before we lose ours altogether
sloan opens the front door
woodward and bernstein pause nod almost an embarrassed pause
then as they hurry out into the rain flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window
when we were in bradlees office simons and rosenfeld are also there along with woodward and bernstein
bradlee plays nerfball mostly he hasnt got the worldss longest attention span
look five men controlled that slush fund as creep three of them weve got mitchell stans magruder and were pretty sure of kalmbach
wed like to wait til we have all five before we print it
this is a daily paper well explain it tomorrow
looks at them youre certain on mitchell
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general and all this now goes fast you got more than one source
yes has any of them got an ax
political personal sexual anything at all against mitchell
no can we use their names
no goddamnit whens somebody gonna go on the record on this story who you got
well sloan and we got a guy in justice deep throat
i saw him
now after the burst of talk a pause youre about to write a story that says that the former attorney general the man who represented law in america is a
throws the nerfball just be right huh
as woodward and bernstein leave the office leave plenty of room for his denial
bernstein at his desk on the phone
he has some papers in front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand
he is tired and very very nervous
it is dark outside
in what follows bernstein takes notes
essex house can i help you
john mitchell please
there is a buzzing sound
sir this is carl bernstein of the washington post and im sorry to bother you but were running a story in tomorrows paper that we thought you should have a
chance to comment on
what does it say
starting to read john n
mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that jeeeeeeesus fund that was used to gather information against the democrats jeeeeeeesus according to sources involved
in the watergate investigation
beginning in the spring of jeeeeeeesus almost a year before he left the justice department jeeeeeeeeesus to become president nixons campaign manager on march mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the
fund all that crap youre putting it in the paper
its all been denied
you tell your publisher tell katie graham shes gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if thats published
thats the most sickening thing i ever heard
sir id like to ask you a few what time is it
morning or night
and he hangs up
bradlee and bernstein at bernsteins desk
bradlee is going over bernsteins notes
he really made that remark about mrs
bernstein nods this is a family newspaper cut the words her tit and run it
and now suddenly rolling the story
theyre modern and gigantic and woodward and bernstein
theyre in the lobby of the post at night and through a thick pane of glass theyre watching their story roll and on their faces is something you dont expect
to see panic
bradlee comes up behind them looks down at the presses starts to talk
once when i was reporting lyndon johnsons top guy gave me the word they were looking for a successor to j
i wrote it and the day it appeared johnson called a press conference and appointed hoover head of the fbi for life
and when he was done he turned to his top guy and the president said call ben bradlee and tell him fuck you
shakes his head i took a lot of static for that everyone said you did it bradlee you screwed up you stuck us with hoover forever looks at woodward and
bernstein i screwed up but i wasnt wrong
they all watch the presses now
you guys havent been wrong yet is that why youre scared shitless
as woodward and bernstein nod bradlee starts away you should be
the presses continuing to roll
the sound is incredible
now clacking away like crazy
we can read the words the senator finished by saying that although he was
and from there a senator and while the words although he was are still very fresh in our minds although i am a republican i would like to state in
a pure bipartisan spirit that i feel only sadness that a once fine journal of record like the post would have become merely the hysterical spokesman for the equally hysterical left wing of the democratic party the sound of the teletype doesnt stop in this little part and we see three people and its very important that their voices are immediately recognizable and distinct
one the senator is from the west and will have that twang
the next two whom we are about to meet are public relations people from creep and the white house
the creep voice is very southern the white house guy sounds like an nbc announcer
the western senator will be seen in a corridor of the senate office building talking to reporters the creep p
southerner will be talking to reporters in front of the creep office doors and so identified
the white house spokesman will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to one side
as the teletype goes on in mid sentence hearsay innuendo and character assassination
i can only conclude that the so called sources of the washington post are a fountain of misinformation the white house has long since stopped being surprised at this type
of reporting by certain elements of the eastern liberal press a lot of activity
bradlee is at his desk reading the teletype dispatches
simons and rosenfeld are there woodward and bernstein too
a kid comes in with more teletype stuff
the editors look at it
reading same kind of crap glancing through nods all non denial denials were dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they dont say the story is inaccurate
whats a real denial
if they ever start calling us goddamn liars little pause its time to start circling the wagons
looking at a new headline you think they know what theyre doing on the fifth floor
i got eight kids to support they better
they start for the sports section only this time they stop go back stare at the headline again
from them watching walking woodward to the elevators
what do you think mrs
graham wants to see me for
maybe to fire you since you two started on this story the post stock has dropped what percent
woodward pushes for the elevator and the word is some nixon people are challenging her tv licenses
im not saying shes going on relief but i dont think its unreasonable for her to want to meet you
you think she wants us to ease up on the story
shrugs i dont know but i dont think thats unreasonable either do you
the elevator opens
woodward shakes his head no and steps inside as we mrs
graham in her office as a secretary lets woodward in
shes standing by the window he crosses to her
im so glad you could come mr
theres a pause
shes trying to say something get something started but its difficult
she stares out again quietly starts to talk
you know the paper was my fathers and my husbands when they were alive and i was thinking back a year or two ago when ben called me and said
he wanted to publish the pentagon papers the next day
the times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said dont dont and i was frightened but i knew if i said no
id lose the whole fifth floor
so we published and that night after id told ben to go ahead i woke up in the darkness and i thought oh my lord what am i doing to
she looks at woodward i woke up again last night with that same question
woodward says nothing waits are we right on this story
i think so
are you sure
when will you be do you think
when are we going to know it all
it may never come out
please dont tell me never
beat ben says youve found some wonderful sources
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to re elect yes maam
and the underground garage one
woodward more nervous now nods would i know him
i couldnt say
but its possible
throat very dry it is
youve never told anyone who he is
woodward shakes his head but youd have to tell me if i asked you
woodward nods tell me
he is dying i would if you really ever wanted to know
i really want to know
woodward caught between a rock and a hard place
he is silent until there is the sound of light laughter and we mrs
the laughter came from her
i wasnt serious
i have plenty of burdens to carry around i dont need another
woodward tries not to exhale too audibly
were going to need lots of good luck arent we
nobody ever had too much
close up mrs
graham as abruptly she reaches out touches woodward on the arm
woodward makes a nod
then in a state of anger pacing around the tiny teletype room
woodward hurries in
bradlee says nothing just points to the ap teletype
woodward looks at it clearly is upset
i thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story to bernstein who tears in you think i like being aced out
times has a huge interview with baldwin the lookout in the motor inn
woodward nods he say anything we dont know
headshake just that a lot of reports were sent to creep but he doesnt name who not here anyway it would have been nice to have had this i sure
would have liked to have had this theres nothing new in it it makes the break in real its a major goddamn story starts out im not going to kick ass over this but id like you to know i hate getting beat i just hate it dont forget that i hate it and he stalks out
woodward and bernstein stand staring at the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the l
times story keeps getting longer
goddamnit shit we gotta top the times i know i know if we could name the guys got the reports wed be ahead again shit who do we know
i know a lawyer at justice has he got an ax
almost every source weve used has been republican this guys a card carrying democrat
then hes got an ax
beat call him anyway
as bernstein nods takes off out of the room studying the front page on which one headline indicates that theyre named the guys at creep who got the reports
who is this woodstein
points to paper two stories on the front page
if he cant pick a winner at pimlico to hell with him
woodward is stirring his morning coffee as bernstein comes in spots him hurries over
bernstein is maybe more excited then weve yet seen him
i want you to shut up and listen to me i havent said anything for the first time im beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward i got a
a guy called me up with a tip carefully someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if theyd like to go to work with him
screwing up the democrats dirty tricks shit like that
the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him they interrogated him but on account of segretti wasnt involved with the break in they
didnt follow through
but segretti did a lot of traveling he called these lawyers from different places and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing
how high up which republicans
thats what weve got to find out but segretti went to southern cal
and so did a bunch of nixon men haldeman i know who else
dwight chapin nixons appointments chief he knew segretti in school
maybe im crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense
what were the three theories
the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasnt any reason they were so far ahead
but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in
so maybe watergate wasnt really about watergate maybe that was just a piece because a year before the republicans werent ahead not in the polls muskie was running ahead of
before he self destructed
if he self destructed
now from the two of them there is the sound of bad guitar music which as we we see is bernstein playing
we are in his apartment its night and the two of them bleary are studying the maze of receipts
segretti criss crossed the country over ten times in six months and never stayed anyplace over a night or two
glancing up switch to another station huh
youre driving me crazy with that
segovia begged me for me secret but i said no andres youll have to try and make it without me
he switches to another song which sounds a lot like the one he just finished playing
pointing to the thickest stacks california illinois florida new hampshire all the major democratic primary states
whirling why does everything you play sound the same
cause i only know four chords the credit cards
the camera moves across the travels of donald segretti
there is the sound of bernsteins guitar
hold for a moment then standing in his doorway
bernstein outside the apartment door
we are it will soon be clear in california now marina del rey
im carl bernstein
segretti nods my paper sent me out to see if i couldnt persuade you to go on the record
mind if i try
segretti shrugs and as they enter his apartment inside
they walk across to a small terrace outside where they sit
the terrace has a glorious view of the water and lots of girls in bathing costume below
according to what weve been able to verify youve been busy
ive got a lot of energy
listen we know youre involved in this were going to get the story why not help
they never told me anything except my own role i had to find out the rest in the papers
by they you mean
he waits segretti just shakes his head
by they you mean the white house dont you
segretti makes no reply your buddy from usc dwight chapin he works for the white house
i know where dwight works
when did he hire you
segretti shakes his head stares out at the girls
do you feel much about the things you did
i didnt do anything wrong
tell that to muskie
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff
during the florida primary you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child
you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe to bernstein off the record
you wrote the canuck letter the one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians
but you know who did
when you guys print it in the paper then ill know
closes his eyes im a lawyer and ill probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did i do that was so awful
bernstein says nothing waits
none of it was my idea carl i didnt go looking for the job
chapin did contact you then
sure off the record
on the orders of haldeman
i dont know anything about haldeman except dwights frightened of him everybodys frightened of him christ i wish id never gotten messed around with this all i wanna do is
sit in the sun sit swim see some girls
it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something hes gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something hes gotten the
ok from the president
cant help you
at usc you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking
segretti half smiles nods ever wonder if nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all
close up segretti staring at the girls and the blue water
what would you have done if you were just getting out of the army if youd been away from the real world for four years if you werent sure what
kind of law you wanted to practice and then one day you got a call from an old friend asking you to go to work for the president of the united states
hold on the question then back in d
walking through the airport
what would you have done
you asking would i have been one of the presidents men
beat i would have been
as they continue on alone in the underground garage
he looks at his watch paces around
its all eerie as hell
then from the ramps footsteps
deep throat moving out of the shadows smoking as always
my turn to keep you waiting
approaches whats the topic for tonight
in my day it was simply called the double cross
i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck
in our context it simply means infiltration of the democrats
i know what it means segretti wouldnt go on the record but if he would we know hed implicate chapin
and that would put us inside the white house
nods yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government
how high up
youll have to find that out wont you
the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking weve almost got that nailed down so he stops as suddenly deep throat dives down behind the nearest car
woodward dropping beside him
did you change cabs
as woodward nods it didnt work something moved there and as he points the shadows by the ramp
you cant see a goddamn thing
but there is the sound faint but distinct of breathing
woodward standing staring into the darkness
he is scared wipes his mouth
he doesnt move for a moment
then he walks directly into the darkness and as hes gone a horrid face in close up red eyed unshaven beaten there are half formed scabs and cuts
he is leaning against a wall shivering
he looks for all the world like a perpetual drunk
woodward in the shadows coming closer
he blinks slowly tongue lolling outside his mouth
he watches woodward approach
woodward coming still closer
he blinks very slowly now
maybe he isnt even certain woodwards there
woodward stopping in front of the drunk
they look at each other for a long time
then who are you
nothing no reaction
woodward studying the other man
and he blinks again then slowly shivering begins sliding down the wall
woodward reaches for him holds him up
woodward managing to get out his wallet take out some bills
he starts up the ramp with the drunk and as they disappear up the ramp out of sight he gives the drunk the money
softly forget your troubles and just be happy
deep throat pacing and smoking
he is visibly upset scared maybe
he glances over as woodward comes back down the ramp alone
self mocking i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery
impatiently do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell havent they done anything about it
they know but they focused on the burglary if it didnt deal with the break in they didnt pursue it
why didnt they
who told them not to
someone with authority id imagine wouldnt you
coughs dont you know what youre onto
mitchell knew then
of course my god you think something this big just happens
the break in and the cover up of course mitchell knew but no more than ehrlichman
you get nothing from me about haldeman
and from this tone you know haldeman scares him
why did they do all this for chrissakes
what were they after
i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they dont think along philosophical lines
talk about segretti dont concentrate on segretti or youll miss the overall scheme too
there were more then
follow every lead every lead goes somewhere the canuck letter was that a white house operation nods bigger dont you miss the grand scheme too
nationwide my god they were frightened of muskie and look who got destroyed they wanted to run against mcgovern and look who theyre running against
they bugged they followed people false press leaks fake letters they canceled democratic campaign rallies they investigated democratic private lives they planted spies stole documents on and on dont tell
me you think this was all the work of little don segretti
and justice and fbi know all this
yes yes everything
there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief
stunned fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats
i was being cautious
inhales you can safely say more then fifty
silence in the garage
then and its noisy
not as noisy as its going to get but there is more tension around just now than there has been previously
an attractive woman in her mid s
on her desk is her name marilyn berger
she is watching bernstein who is standing by the water cooler nearby
as she gets up bernstein drinking water
do you guys know about the canuck letter
nods drinks um hmm
stops looks at her why
i just wanted to be sure you knew who wrote it
as she speaks woodward working at his desk suddenly looking up as a scream comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone turns to see here comes
bernstein dragging berger over to woodwards desk
hysterical tell him what you just told me
just than ken clawsen he used to be a reporter here before he went to work for nixon i had him over for a drink a few weeks ago and
he told me he wrote the canuck letter
she looks from one of them to the other you did want to know didnt you
and now from her woodward and bernstein in a corner of the room talking low and fast
you think were being set up
christ deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names
it makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the white house
each new member of the presidents staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon
you think this was clawsens initiation
could have won him a fraternity paddle with a white house seal
beat god knows it worked
a frozen shot of muskie in the snow in tears standing on the flat bed truck
this was in the new hampshire primary just after the canuck letter was published
you claiming it was all a misunderstanding ken
absolutely marilyns gotten it totally wrong shes an awfully good reporter i cant remember her getting too much wrong before can you
thats a bullshit question thats a question straight out of wichita kansas
sorry ken listen one last thing where did your talk with berger happen
beat what do you mean where
well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant ive completely forgotten where it was except i know it wasnt her apartment
there is a sound of him hanging up the phone
woodward hangs up quietly rubs his eyes calls out to berger who is at her desk non denial denial marilyn berger is about to answer when her phone rings
she picks it up turns to woodward mouths its him and we berger on the phone
again clawsen on the other end
for chissakes dont tell them i came to your place
i already told them
oh thats terrific thats just so terrific im thrilled you did that
i have a clear conscience
marilyn i have a wife and a family and a cat and a dog
now from this and we woodward and bernstein heading toward the office
as they enter i got clawsen on hold his dialing finger must be falling off what do you think
he went to her apartment and he told her if he did it or just said he did it god knows
i could care less about where it happened what happened is what counts
calling out to his put him on
picks up the phone ken im sorry it was goddamn beirut and they were having a crisis whats up kid
pause slow down ken you sound frazzled
pause a wife and a family and a cat and a dog right ken
pause ken i would never print that you were in marilyns apartment at night unless of course you force me to
close up bradlee
he is genuinely enjoying himself
now he puts his hand over the receiver its like they taught us at harvard few things are as gratifying to the soul as having another mans nuts in a
now as he goes back to talking now we hold on that headline as the three deniers are visible through it in the same places they spoke before
the story is based entirely on hearsay and we at the committee are continually amazed at the creativity shown by the washington post although i am a republican i would
like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit that i am happy that this latest onslaught against the intelligence of the american people will be wrapping fish tomorrow
i offer my condolences to the fish
and now the headline fades as we woodward and bernstein hurry in
weve just been talking to young which young
larry young a california lawyer he was going to go into law practice with segretti
and he says chapin hired segretti well and good but when will he say it on the record
he just did
hell give us a sworn statement
were inside the white house now
rosenfeld and simons just look at each other
they should be happy and maybe they are
but at the moment more then anything else they look scared
then its a very fancy restaurant and bradlee is at a corner table as woodward and bernstein sit down
they are exhausted
look i wanted to talk because things are getting really hairy and theres a couple of things weve got to be careful of because a waiter is nearby
either of you want a drink or should i order
they dont because and suddenly he lapses into perfect french with the waiter ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes because our cocks are on the
chopping block and youve got to be sure that youre not just dealing with people who hate richard nixon and want to get him through us
you see i dont give a shit whos president i really dont its an adversary situation between them and us and its always gonna be
i never had a closer friend than jack kennedy and once i printed something that pissed him off and for seven months i didnt exist
a wine steward appears hands bradlee the list
as he examines it a man walks up to the table stands there
you none of you know who i am do you
they dont you screw me up good you dont even know what i look like
ok youve had your preamble who the hell are you
glenn sedam you wrote about me last week you said i was one of the guys at the committee who was sent reports
you were wrong
baldwin told the fbi it was you
baldwin told the fbi it was someone whose first name sounded like a last name
they showed him a list and he picked me but it wasnt me it was gordon liddy
looks at the reporters my phone hasnt stopped ringing my wifes hysterical my kids think im mixed up with the burglary my friends dont like me around all of a
you fucked around my life you two
starts off i just wanted to say thanks
bradlee watching woodward and bernstein who are clearly upset
that didnt sound to me like a non denial denial could you have been wrong
they nod you had a good source
nod did he have an ax
then another nod all right you made a mistake maybe we all have just dont make another
and watch your personal lives who you hang around with
someone once said the price of democracy is a bloodletting every ten years
beat make sure it isnt our blood
now from bradlee holding a broom and dustpan at his front door
i really cant talk now thisll only take one second my wife just had the baby my in laws are arriving im trying to get the house in some kind
a boy or a girl
inside the house
woodward and bernstein are helping sloan with the housework
woodward has a dust mop bernstein a dust cloth
we are mostly in the living room throughout and also throughout the three guys beaver away tidying
holding up a cup where does this go
sloan points to a shelf
woodward moves to put the cup in its proper place
that cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the democrats five guys had control ticking them off mitchell stans magruder kalmbach were working on the last guy now and were
going all the way that fifth man was haldeman
im not your source on that its gotta be haldeman someone from the white house had to be involved and it wasnt ehrlichman or colson or the president
no none of those
that leaves haldeman period
im not your source on that
he picks up a dust pan starts sweeping it full
taking the dust pan helping out look when the watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names
of course everything they asked if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund
let me put it this way id have no problem if you did
woodward and bernstein look at each other while sloan empties the dust pan into the trash and from there quickly walking in the park
we cant really make them out clearly we never do in this little sequence
but the guy is wearing a windbreaker and has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually too
he has his arm around her and they are deep in conversation
woodward and bernstein sitting on a park bench swilling down a six pack
i think thats him
the couple walking along
we just cant quite make them out
but it might be
woodward and bernstein staring after the couple trying to focus
squints hard maybe
what if i went up and introduced myself think hed slug me
well we are trying to ruin his life
its nothing personal though
looks troubled whats the matter
same as magruder i dont like it when they turn out to be human
nods i wish we were investigating attila the hun
maybe we are
the slow walking couple
they continue on
we still dont see them quite clearly
then a drugstore type place
woodward and bernstein are at the adjoining table
goddamnit im not gonna say it again you get nothing about haldeman outta me we dont need it now because tomorrows story is about the fbi about how all you
supposed experts really blew the whole investigation stung we didnt miss so much you never knew haldeman had control of the slush fund its all in our files not about haldeman yeah haldeman john haldeman
and he gets up quickly goes
woodward and bernstein savor the moment but only briefly as it hits them jesus he said john haldeman not bob haldeman and as they take off after the agent woodward
bernstein bradlee simons rosenfeld
the editors have a long story and they all read and pace read and pace the reporters look traumatized with fatigue
all this goes fast
staring at the typed story i dont know i dont know it feels thin christ i wish i knew if we should print this listen we didnt make them do
these things once they did its our job to report it to the reporters go over your sources again sloan told the grand jury he answered everything they asked him that means theres a record somewhere and the fbi confirms what more do you need
whirling to bernstein listen i love this country you think i want to bring it down
im not some goddamn zany i was a hawk harry werent you just arguing the opposite way
maybe im tense well shit we oughtta be tense were about to accuse mr
haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in america of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house beat it would be nice if we
were right to the reporters you double checked both sources
bernstein are you sure on this story
absolutely to woodward what about you
im sure im not sure it still feels thin looks at simons to woodward and bernstein after a puse get another source
now quickly woodward and bernstein huddling outside bradlees office
how many fucking sources they think we got
deep throat wont confirm i never thought he was scared of anyone but hes scared of haldeman
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury
looks at woodward we got twenty minutes to deadline and as he speaks bernstein talking softly from a relatively private phone in the newsroom
the voice of the lawyer is also whispered and scared to death
barely audible you shouldnt ever call me like this carl
will you confirm that haldeman was mentioned by sloan to the grand jury
i wont say anything about haldeman
desperate all right listen its against the law if you talk about the grand jury right
but you dont have to say a thing ill count to ten if the storys wrong hang up before i get there if its ok stay on the line till
after got it
hang up right
right right ok counting one two he inhales deeply three four five six now hes starting to get excited seven eight inhales deeply nine ten thank you
youve got it straight now
everything on a note of triumph yeah
and on that shout on the record let me say just this the story is totally untrue
on background id like to add that bob haldeman is one of the greatest public servants this country has ever had and the story is a goddamned lie
roaring out of his office doorway
woodward and bernstein tearing into bradlees office he stands scowling at the tv set in a corner of the room outside it is raining like hell
the tv set
sloan is walking along toward a large office building he is flanked by a lawyer
a tv reporter it was daniel schorr is walking alongside mike in hand
sloan would you care to comment on your testimony before the grand jury
my lawyer says the answer is an unequivocal no
sloan did not implicate mr
haldeman in that testimony at all
woodward and bernstein
they look sick
desperate tired stunned confused there is nothing to say
bradlee glaring at them
hold on bradlee
then in the rain and a corridor in the building as the pudgy fbi man retreats down the hall
woodward and bernstein soaked chase after him
ill deny everything everything i never talked to you about haldeman i never talked to you about anything im not talking to you now what went wrong
for chrissakes just tell that fuck you fuck you fuck you and he tears into an office slams the door and as we hear it lock my reasons are as
follows it is a complicated long scene to put down we are terribly late in our story it would mean here two hours into the movie we are bringing in an entirely new character the fbi agents head to whom they go and i think that is unnecessary and confusing and most important i think the characters have been abused enough in this version we have added the sedam scene and they are berated more in this version by the creep people before things turn
finally all this can show in reality is that they are desperate and i would rather let the actors give that to us
i feel that it would be a genuine error at this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how its bad manners for a reporter to burn
a source if weve got anything going by this point i cant conceive of much an audience will be less interested in than the reporters misbehaving
however if the scene is requested next time through i shall be only too happy to oblige
what i would like to do is cut from the fbi saying fuck you fuck you fuck you and locking his door to the following woodward and bernstein walking in
its pouring as they leave fbi headquarters and they are in anguish
after a while woodward
what was the mistake
do you think its been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered
they couldnt have set us up better after all these months our credibilitys gone you know what that means
nods only everything
they are soaked nearby is a garbage can they grab papers hold them over their heads start to walk
now the papers they grabbed were the post front page
and as they walked the haldeman story was on their heads
hold on the reporters walking miserably through the rain
now a tremendous pall has settled on the city room
people walk by glancing at woodward and bernstein who sit almost immobilized at their desks wet whipped no energy left
simons sits across from bradlee as rosenfeld enters quietly with a bundle of teletype paper
indicating the papers more denunciations
nods one senator just gave a speech slurring us times in minutes
bradlee has started typing something brief
when rosenfelds done so is he
he hands it to simons
my non denial denial
were not printing a retraction
close up bradlee
he is thoughtful for a while
then spinning around staring out towards the newsroom fuck it lets stand by the boys
and he stands spins out of the room as we the rain has stopped
the apartment is dark
its late at night
inside the phone rings and woodwards apartment in the dark as he manages to knock the phone off its cradle
whatd you find
jesus christ what time is it
he fumbles for the lamp as it falls with a crash woodward moving
hair wild clothes half buttoned he runs through the dark washington streets as we two well dressed men in the shadows across the street going in the same direction and
woodward spotting them picking up the pace and the two men moving faster too and now a bunch of cabs
woodward jumps into the first and as it roars off the two men getting into a cab also roaring off in the same direction and woodwards cab taking a corner
fast and as it goes on hold until the second cab takes the same corner faster and now woodward jumping out of his cab fumbling into his pockets for change as we the two men getting out of their cab paying and as their cab drives off woodward diving back into his cab and in a moment it is roaring again through the night and we the two well dressed men standing on the sidewalk watching as woodward disappears into the night and then suddenly you were doing so well and then you got stupid you went too fast christ what a royal screw up deep throat and woodward in the underground garage
i know i know the pressures off the white house and its all back on the post youve done worse than let haldeman slip away youve got people feeling sorry
for him i didnt think that was possible
a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyones neck
you build from the outer edges and you go step by step
if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure
youve put the investigation back months
we know that and if we were wrong were resigning were we wrong
youll have to find that out wont you
im tired of your chickenshit games i dont want hints i want what you know
he blinks for a moment
then he begins to whisper
it was a haldeman operation the whole business he ran the money but he was insulated youll have to find out how woodward takes a breath nods
wait almost a smile theres more
and from his weathered face walking up to his apartment house later that night
he sees and then we see bernstein asleep at the front door
he comes awake as woodward approaches
we gotta go see bradlee ill fill you in in the car
its a house with a lawn and from somewhere there is the sound of dogs barking
you couldnt have told me over the phone
woodward and bernstein moving up the walk to bradlee
we cant trust the phones not anymore
deep throat says so
as woodward beckons for him to move out into the lawn we cant talk inside either
headshake electronic surveillance
the three of them moving out onto the lawn
its october now
you can see their breaths as they speak
i finally got through to sloan it was all a misunderstanding that we had he would have told the grand jury about haldeman he was ready to only nobody on
the grand jury asked him the goddamn question
so i guess you could say that we screwed up but we werent wrong
anything else from mr
mitchell started the cover up early everyone is involved in the cover up all the way to the top
the whole u
intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities
the extent of it is incredible
little pause and peoples lives are in danger maybe including ours
he nods again starts walking the two reporters back toward woodwards car
hes wrong on that last were not in the least danger because nobody gives a shit what was that gallup poll result
half the countrys never even heard the word watergate
the red karmann ghia as the three approach
look youre both probably a little tired right
they nod you should be youve been under a lot of pressure
so go home have a nice hot bath rest up fifteen minutes if you want before you get your asses back in gear louder now because were under a lot
of pressure too and you put us there not that i want it to worry you nothings riding on you except the first amendment of the constitution plus the freedom of the press plus the reputation of a hundred year old paper plus the jobs of the two thousand people who work there still building but none of that counts as much as this you fuck up again im gonna lose my temper
pause softer i promise you you dont want me to lose my temper
shooing them off move move move what have you done for me tomorrow
and as they get back into the car and its empty pretty much except at their desks sit woodward and bernstein typing away
they type on and on and as they do voices are heard the same voices weve become familiar with the western senator the creep p
man and the white although im a republican i would like to state in a pure bipartisan spirit tht the greatest political scandal of this campaign is the brazen manner
in which without benefit of clergy the washington post has set up housekeeping with the mcgovern campaign
for twenty years the eastern liberal press has been trying to smear dick nixon
fortunately the american public is too smart to be fooled by
i have been informed reliably by john dean that no one connected with the white house
coming in overlapping it is only our pathetic post that deliberately tries to infuse the watergate caper with a seriousness far beyond those shenanigans that have been the stock trade
of political pranksters ever since
woodward and bernstein work on
and now as the voices continue condemning we see them all the presidents men as their faces flash on the screen for an instant only these arent fashion portraits were
looking at these are the mug shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash on the mug shots and the name and across each the word convicted
theres virgilio gonzales convicted and eugenio martinez convicted and frank sturgis convicted and bernard barker convicted and james mccord convicted and howard hunt convicted and gordon liddy convicted and donald
segretti convicted and dwight chapin convicted and now the denunciations are louder shriller briefer
an insult to the american public the deplorable tactics employed by the washington post i have been given access to evidence in possession of the white house and that evidence
woodward and bernstein type on
their machines are the only sound in the enormous room
and now more mug shots appear convicted herbert kalmbach convicted and larue and porter and mitchell and haldeman all all the presidents men convicted
now the camera starts to move toward the pillar the one that separates the two reporters and the denunciations are still going on but not so loud now not so
well if i was wrong i sure the hell wasnt alone the fact remains that except for watergate we ran one hell of a great campaign
the camera is almost at the pillar now
bernstein bums a cigarette from a cleaning lady
woodward kicks his typewriter
then they both go back to work
now were at the pillar
thats all we see
