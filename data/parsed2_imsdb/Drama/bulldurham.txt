by ron shelton in baseball you dont know nothing
yogi berra whoever wants to know the heart and mind of america had better learn baseball
jacques barzun you could look it up
casey stengel titles over a series of still photos
black and white
babe ruth swings an icon of american history
his giant upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet
the huge bat in an elegant follow through
ty cobb rounds third the most vicious ballplayer of them all a balletic whirling dervish
jackie robinson steals rome yogi berra applies the tag
joe dimaggio with his son in the yankee clubhouse
walking down the runway joe in uniform
a wall covered with baseball pictures behind a small table covered with objects and lit candles
a baseball an old baseball card a broken bat a rosin bag a jar of pine tar also a peacock feather a silk shawl a picture of isadora duncan
clearly the arrangement is a shrine and it glows with the candles like some religious altar
we hear a womans voice in a north carolina accent
i believe in the church of baseball
beat ive tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones ive worshipped buddha allah brahma vishnu shiva trees mushrooms and isadora duncan
pan away from the shrine across the room
late afternoon light spills into the room across fine old furniture to a small dressing table
a woman applies make up
annie savoy mid s touches up her face
very pretty knowing outwardly confident
words flow from her southern lips with ease but her view of the world crosses southern national and international borders
i know things
for instance beat there are beads in a catholic rosary
and beat there are stitches in a baseball
beat when i learned that i gave jesus a chance
beat but it just didnt work out between us
the lord laid too much guilt on me
i prefer metaphysics to theology
beat you see theres no guilt in baseball
and its never boring
annie opens a closet door dozens of shoes hang from the door
she chooses a pair of red high heels with thin straps
she sits on a bench and which makes it like sex
beat theres never been a ballplayer slept with me who didnt have the best year of his career
beat making love is like hitting a baseball you just got to relax and concentrate
annie slips on the red high heels smoothing her hands up her calves as she does
besides id never sleep with a player hitting under
unless he had a lot of r
s or was a great glove man up the middle
beat a womans got to have standards
she holds our her legs displaying the heels side by side
like a little girl showing off her new shoes
the young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they dont realize that come july and august when the weather is hot its hard to perform at your
beat the veterans pace themselves better
they finish stronger
theyre great in september
beat while i dont believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled i do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy hed have that youthful exuberance but the
veterans sense of timing
annie starts packing a huge handbag with fruit an official scorebook binoculars a radar gun and lipstick
ysee theres a certain amount of life wisdom i give these boys
beat i can expand their minds
sometimes when ive got a ballplayer alone ill just read emily dickinson or walt whitman to him
the guys are so sweet they always stay and listen
beat of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks its foreplay
annie touches perfume behind her ears and ever so slightly in her cleavage
i make then feel confident
they make me feel safe
annie poses in front of the mirror she smoothes her dress along her hips
and puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses
stylish and slightly mad
what i give them lasts a life time
what they give me lasts games
sometimes it seems like a bad trade
quickly rebounding but bad trades are part of baseball who can forget frank robinson or milt pappas for godsakes
beat its a long season and you got to trust it
annie starts for the door and grabs her baseball glove a frame house with porch and lots of trees a thomas wolfe house
with a faded red volvo in the driveway
annie leaves on foot turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic old durham north carolina neighborhood
in the b
other people are heading the same direction annie pulls a durham bulls baseball cap from her handbag and pulls it on her head
ive tried them all i really have beat and the only church that truly feeds the soul day in day out is the church of baseball
now visible in the late afternoon sun a rickety old stadium carved into the center of an old tobacco town
people are arriving on foot from all around
rock around the clock by bill haley fills the air
close on a baseball clown max patkin at home plate doing his famous bill haley routine
a comic pitchers windup full of twists and goofy choreography
one oclock two oclock three oclock rock

annie sits down in her private box seat her chair is wiped off by a young black boy jackson who then sits next to her
he is her employed errand runner note sender and friend
a group of groupies enters the park year old girl women dressed in tight pants tight everything

of tobacco in his cheek stands with his pitching coach larry hockett late s an ex big leaguer whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges
larry rolls some red man chewing tobacco into a slab of pink bubble gum carefully folding the corners tucking it neatly together
larry examines it as they talk and shoves the giant chaw into his mouth

skip whirls and heads back out to the field and ebby unperturbed turns his attention back to millie
got time for another quickie
jesus you got a game to pitch
but we got three minutes
max patkin still flailing away to rock around the clock
when the clock strikes two three and four and the band slows down well yell for more gonna rock around the clock tonight
annie looks through her binoculars studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as patkin winds up his act
number twenty twos thighs are just great
reading the program jose galindo

a woman announcer marylou speaks into the p

the greatest show on dirt your own durham bulls
close on another player mickey mcfee black
smoking a cigarette always smoking a cigarette
he snuffs out his cigarette and runs onto the field with the rest of the team as ebby enters the dugout from the runway
larry and skip encourage their players running onto the field
ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck
he smiles broadly at skip and larry and grabs his glove
im there skip im ready
the radio announcer teddy cullinane leans into the radio mike of a very small local station
next to him is the local sportswriter whitey sherrard
between them theyve seen a million minor league players come and go

i hear hes a quart low
covering the mike hes left handed

heralded young left hander ebby calvin laloosh
beat stepping in for the peninsula white sox is leadoff hitter willie foster angle to annies box seat millie has joined annie and jackson
clearly the younger women look up to annie for wisdom and insight
millie youve got to stay out of the clubhouse
itll just get everybody in trouble
i got lured
you didnt get lured
women never get lured
theyre too strong and powerful for that
now say it i didnt get lured and i will take responsibility for my actions
i didnt get lured and i will take responsibility for my actions
to jackson got the radar ready
jackson aims a radar gun at the plate
the peninsula white sox leadoff hitter steps in
the word on laloosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control
ebby calvin laloosh winds up and fires
the pitch sails over the batters head over the catchers head over the backstop and crashes into the press box
the announcer and sportswriter crash to the floor as the ball smashes into their booth
skip spits tobacco mumbles flatly to larry
shouts to ebby cmon big un youre okay
annies box seat she turns to jackson
ninety five miles an hour
he looks great just great
the catcher talks to ebby trying to calm him down
what the hell was that

the catcher returns to the plate
whitey and teddy warily climb back to their seats
one ball and no strikes to willie foster
ebbys next pitch hits foster in the ribs
annies box seat shes writing a note
she hands it to jackson
take this to ebby in the dugout between innings
whats it say
it says hes not bending his back on his follow through
jackson runs off with the note
annie turns to millie
well lets get down to it honey how was he
well he fucks like he pitches
sorta all over the place hit rock around the clock quick montage of ebbys first game strikeouts and wild pitches
a young gifted uncontrollable thrower
when the chimes ring five six and seven well be right in seventh heaven gonna rock around the clock tonight
ebby unleashes a wild one and decks the bull mascot
ebby in the dugout reads the note from annie
ebby strikes out a peninsula batter
ebby unleashes another wild one and a batter hits the dirt
end rock around the clock and skip walks through the players room players are up joking irreverently
hey lefty hold em to runs every night youll win he might be serious had em all the way
a durham player sitting half dressed in front of his locker
a picture of jesus hangs amidst his gear
the player jimmy has a bible and prays softly to himself
dear lord thank you for being with us tonight thank you for protecting us from injury and deke walks by shaking jimmy irreverently as he prays
wake up wake up mickey a black complains to tony as they undress

beat and he hit the radio announcer a sportswriter and the bull mascot twice also league records beat joe the guys got some serious shit
the door opens a player enters in street clothes carrying his suitcases
crash davis older than the other players
more than just opinions he actually has a point of view
a career minor leaguer hanging on wherever he can get a job
unlike ebby crash knows a lot about the world without baseball
also unlike ebby he loves baseball desperately
crash speaks slowly with a trace of cynicism and pride like an old warrior who knows hes just a hired gun
i am the player to be named later
skip looks out half dressed from his cubicle
the crash davis
beat then nonstop and you larry hockett should recognize me cause five years ago in the texas league when you were pitching for el paso and i was hitting cleanup

deep breath but the organization has decided to make a change were releasing you from your contract
close on ed silent
crash puts his bag in a locker as other players return from the shower
crash watches as ebby soaks his elbow in a tub of ice water as the sports writer whitey interviews him
hows it feel to get your first professional win

a major rush
i mean it doesnt just feel out there but it feels out there
utterly fucking hopeless
loud country music in the players hangout and pickup spot

annie nods at crash he comes over to her table greets max as an old friend and introduces himself

several couples dance and out of the pack ebby dances with a groupie spinning and whirling uninhibited and infectious
hes suddenly dancing with a different woman then another and another
annie crash and max watch the mad performance
whos he dancing with

ebby puts on a one man show on the dance floor the whole bar stops to watch him applauding as he spins to a finish
a quirkier saturday night fever show
more naive fun
he climbs off the floor and joins annies table
thanks for the note youre right i wasnt bending my back

he extends his hand to introduce himself
ebby calvin laloosh

a circle is formed
millie clings to tony her guy of the moment
crash and ebby face off

crash pulls a baseball from his jacket pocket tosses it to ebby
id kill ya
from what i hear you couldnt hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot dont try me
cmon right in the chest
you cant hit me cause youre starting to think about it already youre starting to think how embarrassing itll be to miss how all these people would laugh
teasing mercilessly cmon rook show me that million dollar arm cause im getting a good idea about the five cent head ebby rears back and fires the ball from ten
feet away right at crashs chest
but alas the ball goes through a second story window in the distance
crash never blinks
ebby is enraged he charges crash lunging at him
who the fuck are you
crash lashes out a short left with lightning speed effortless
ebby goes down
and stays there stunned
he looks up
im crash davis
your new catcher
and you just got lesson number one dont think it can only hurt the ballclub
beat buy ya a drink
annie and max dance to billy eckstein on the juke box
millie and tony are also on the dance floor
on juke box april in paris chestnuts in blossom holiday tables under the tree
ebby and crash watch from the corner table ebbys right eye is blackened
he holds a drink on it
we fight she gets the clown hows that happen

shes playing with my mind
its a damn easy thing to play with
annie suddenly appears at the table
well you boys stopped fighting yet

beat shall we go to my place
which one of us
oh both of you of course
close on ebby his eyes full of fear and wonder
close on crash he smiles
the three of them leave the bar together
the shrine of baseball glows annie lights the candles
ebby and crash sit on opposite ends of her couch both men look around the room with wonder
ebby is clearly more nervous than crash whos been in some strange rooms in his minor league career
these are the ground rules
beat i hook up with one guy a season i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy kinda my own spring training
beat and well you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far
i thought we should get to know each other
why do you get to choose
why dont i get to choose
actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other
its all quantum physics and molecular attraction
there are laws we dont understand that bring us together and break us apart
is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what
youre a regular nuclear meltdown honey slow down
crash rises to leave and heads for the door
after years in the minor leagues i dont tryout
besides i dont believe in quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heart
challenging him what do you believe in
crash at the door
annies question is slightly taunting
he stops and speaks with both aloofness and passion i believe in the soul the cock the pussy the small of a womans back the hanging curve ball high fiber
good scotch long foreplay show tunes and that the novels of thomas pynchon are self indulgent overrated crap
beat i believe that lee harvey oswald acted alone i believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro turf and the designated hitter i believe in the sweet
spot voting every election soft core pornography chocolate chip cookies opening your presents on christmas morning rather than christmas eve and i believe in long slow deep soft wet kisses that last for days
breathless oh my
softly dont leave
crash heads out into the night
annie hurries to the door while ebby sits on the couch bewildered
hey whats all this molecule stuff
annie stands in the doorway crash is on the porch
wait crash dont go all i want is a date
im not gonna fall in love with you or nothin
im not interested in a woman whos interested in that boy

ebby appears in the door

crash walks out into the durham night
ebby and annie stand in the doorway
she speaks softly to ebby
no ballplayer ever said no to a date with me
well shit then lets fuck
annie puts on a record edith piaf sings le trois cloches
ebby starts undressing across the room
wait honey slow down i want to watch
she sits in a chair
ebby practically rips his shirt off exposing a great upper body
no no no
put it back on and take it off slowly
jesus what kinda broad are you
when you know how to make love youll know how to pitch
turning to the stereo shh

ebby re buttons then unbuttons his shirt
it drops revealing his back
oh my what a nice back
ebby drops his pants

sweetly unthreatening you think dwight gooden leaves his socks on
ebby considers this
pulls his pants back up
takes his socks off
then his pants
ebby honey have you ever been handcuffed in bed
deserted streets of the old tobacco town
crash walks alone
he picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can
he stops in front of a store window
he rolls the newspaper like a short bat
he takes a batting stance and crash takes his batting stance in front of the window studying his reflection
he taken a swing
a group of old black men stand in a doorway watching
click a handcuff is locked onto ebbys wrist
both his arms are outstretched hes getting very excited
i read about stuff like this
bring it on
annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down
sweetie have you ever heard of walt whitman
whos he play for
well he sort of pitches for the cosmic all stars

annie opens a book and begins reading as piaf sings softly
good then listen
reading i sing the body electric
the armies of those i love engirth me and i engirth them we gonna fuck or what
reading they will not let me off till i go with them respond to them and discorrupt them and charge them limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous quivering
jelly of love white blow and delirious juice close on ebbys face intrigued aroused frightened
the old black man is tossing wadded up balls of paper at crash who takes beautiful fluid swings with the rolled up newspaper
close on crashs eyes studying the pitches with intense concentration endlessly working on his game
larry deke mickey and bobby are singing at home plate as a pre game show
larry is diana ross the other three are the supremes and the routine is brilliantly tacky
baby love oh oh baby love i need ya oh how i need ya all ya do is treat me bad take my heart and leave me sad
jimmy stands on a bench trying to get the players attention

ebby goes to his locker and starts undressing
crash sits next to him looking straight ahead
hey crash does that mean what i think it means

crash studies ebby
your shower shoes have fungus on em
youll never get to the bigs with fungus on your shower shoes
beat think classy and youll be classy
if you win in the show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the pressll think youre colorful
beat until you win twenty in the show however it means youre a slob
crash rises and heads out to the field
ebby sits silently holding his shower shoes taking it all in
in the dugout the game from a dugout p
the players sit stand stir restlessly
a combination of relaxation and intensity not visible from the stands
crash is handed his bat and helmet by the bat boy
this guys bringing some serious smoke out there
the winston salem pitcher throwing hard

pitchers third delivery high and tight

annie and jackson in the stands shes writing a note quickly and hands it to jackson who hurries off
the pitchers next pitch a major league fastball
it explodes to the plate
crash walks back to the dugout head high no show of emotion
an old warrior not giving an inch even in defeat
he re enters the dugout sits down and starts putting the catchers gear back on
deke leans over
serious heat eh
he aint got shit
the batboy takes the note from jackson and hands it to crash who refuses to accept it being busy putting his gear on
you have a lovely swing but youre pulling your hips out too early
id be happy to meet you at the batting cage tomorrow to discuss it
well if theres one chickd know when youre pulling your hips out early annies the one
crash doesnt seem too amused
he grabs the note and the pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout wall
he scrawls a quick note
annies private box shes watching the players through binoculars as jackson returns with the note
looking through the glasses whatd he say
jackson looks at the note uneasily then reads it says
i want to make
love to you
annie puts down the glasses takes the note
annie digs in at the plate bat in hand
crash a few feet away
annie spits on her hands wear batting glove pumps the bat back and forth
the mechanical pitching machine delivers kawoosh
annie swings lashes out a line drive
see my hips
i think thomas pynchons a genius
when youre hitting you shouldnt think about anything but hitting
beat but you shouldnt think about it too much
the trick is to use your brain to not use your brain
but you were pulling your hips last night
wanta make love
annie swings and misses the next pitch
im committed to nuke for the season
you had your chance the other night
whatyou see in that guy hes dim pretty boy
a young wild
young men are uncomplicated
crash mutters and hes not dim
hes just inexperienced
my job is to give him life wisdom and help him make it to the major leagues
thats my job too
annie swings and misses another pitch
youre pulling your hips out
but theyre nice hips
beat i looked up your records youve hit home runs in the minors
annie fouls one off and digs in gamely
dont tell anybody
if you hit twenty homers this year youll be the all time minor league champ
home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor if ya think about it
oh no i think itd be great
the sporting news should know about it
annie swings and misses another one
crash steps in to hit he takes his familiar stance
the pitch comes
crash drills it
your place or mine
despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most judao christian ethics i am within the framework of a baseball season monogamous
fact is youre afraid of meeting a guy like me cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can
boss around whack a line drive great deal
you get to write self indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing whack a line drive
so what do you really want
you wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic
whack a line drive or do you want a guy
the pitching machine arm flaps
you do make speeches
crash puts the bat down heads out the gate
a little league team arrives twenty five year olds in uniform with a couple parent coaches
hey are you crash davis
can i have a autograph
crash stops to sign autographs amidst little leaguers
as he signs autographs well annie your place or mine
you got me all confused
a batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing im not a real batter
im a woman
hey when are you guys gonna start winning
its a long season boys
suddenly a voice nuke pulls up gets out of his porsche
coming over whatre you guys doing here stealing my girl
now nuke would i do a thing like that
to the little leaguers hey kids this is the great ebby calvin nuke laloosh
its nuke its nuke
can i have your autograph
no prob kids and suddenly nuke is swept up into a sea of little leaguers
crash smiles as he turns annie and the kids over to nuke
see you guys at the ballpark
crash leaves annie with nuke and little leaguers
an aging shelby mustang convertible the paints fading a couple dings in the body but loaded under the hood
crash punches his tape deck sam cookes you send me
annie bites her fist watching crash leave
the sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a few candles
yes yes yesnmmmmyes
beat oh my
several beats oh that was just fabulous crash
several beats of silence
he flips on a lamp near the bed
you mean nuke
you said crash
i didnt say crash
i said nuke
you said crash
honey dont ever listen to a woman when shes making love
theyll say the strangest things
you said crash
would you rather me be making love to him using your name or making love to you using his name
nuke considers this fabulous logic
yeah maybe youre right
you see how nice things are when we go slow
nuke sighs and lets his head sink in the pillow

back to the mayor and city council hair and hats blowing from the chopper turbulence
five four three two one

one thousand big ones
the helicopter dumps hundreds of dollar bills above the field
the night sky fills with fluttering money the rope is dropped three hundred little leaguers charge across the infield to the falling money scooping it up wildly brawling shoving clawing
for the cash
as the money flutters down
close on the rosin bag on the mound
a hand picks it up
puffs of rosin smoke
nuke is on the mound
nuke nervously walks around the mound just before the first batter
he picks up the rosin bag
digs a slot for his lead foot to land
and crash approaches in full gear mask tipped up on his head
dont try to strike everybody out
beat strikeouts are boring
throw some ground balls its more democratic
crash turns and heads to the plate and we hear the beginning of nukes interior monologue
whats this guy know eh
if hes so great whys he been in the minors for ten years
and if hes so hot how come annie wants me instead of him
crash turns around half way to the plate and returns to the mound as if he knows everything nukes thinking

crash crosses the plate past the hitter
he speaks to the opposing leadoff batter
whys he always call me meat

nuke winds up and delivers a fastball
the leadoff hitter tees off on the pitch and sends a line shot over the right field fence
close on billboard hit cow win steak sign the home run hits the cow on a target painted on the cows rump
the cows mouth opens and moos
the batter stands and watches the home run admiring the shot enjoying the moment
crash gets in his face instantly and gets very tough
whatre you lookin at
youre showing up my pitcher bush get your ass in gear
the batter takes off on a home run trot slightly scared
and crash heads to the mound where nuke watches the mooing cow and the circling batter with dismay

an ebby calvin nuke laloosh fastball
twenty feet wide of the plate
the bull mascot dives for cover the ball hits the bat rack

nuke pitches again the batter lines a single to left
christ skip and larry are talking about me

skip slaps nuke on the ass in a gruff reassuring way and returns to the dugout
leaving nuke and crash

crash smiles and as he returns to the plate
annie watches in the stands with jackson and the radar gun
here we go again jackson hold on tight
hit professor longhair rock and roll
and nuke delivers a batter grounds out weakly
durham at bat dugout crash lets jose rub his bat with a chicken bone cross
then steps to the plate and crash hits a long home run and circles the bases
nuke delivers a line drive nearly undresses him
runners circle the bases
the showers naked bodies in the steamy room
no joking around
a team on losing streak
suddenly skip steps into the shower in his uniform and angrily throws an armload of bats into the shower
anybody not outta the shower in ten seconds gonna get fined a hundred bucks
the shower empties in seconds
players grab a seat and whitey the sportswriter enters as he does every night
no press for five minutes whitey
im doing a column on the myth of sisyphus as manifest in a minor league losing streak joe and i thought
skip picks up a chair and fires it at whitey the chair crashes into a locker
whitey hurries out
if i ever need a brain transplant ill choose a sportswriter cause that way id be getting a brain thats never been used
a couple snickers from the players
whatre you laughing at
the durham bulls sit and stand quietly
you guys lollygag the ball around the infield ya lollygag youre way to first ya lollygag in an outta the dugout

beat jose whats this sign
skip flashes through a sequence of signs
hand to face hand to belt hand brushes letters etc
thats the steal
thats the bunt
this is the steal
skip flashes quickly another sequence hand to face hands to hands
he speaks rapidly a private language
face is skin to skin
skin starts with s
s stands for steal if it follows the indicator which is hand to eye cause the word indicator starts with an i so i figure eye touches his eye would
remind you of i for indicator to indicate that what follows is the sign
i figure wrong youre a buncha lollygaggers
beat this is a simple game
beat ya throw the ball ya hit the ball ya catch the ball
close on faces of the players sitting silently
the six players wives wait in a cluster
three of them have small children
the children are crying
the long suffering women try to calm the kids
bobby went hitless again
hes gonna be in a terrible mood
howd mickey do
he got two hits
back inside the locker room skip is winding down
we cant win at home how we gonna win on the road
we got a twelve day road trip starting tomorrow
beat bus leaves at six in the morning
skip heads back inside his little office with larry
inside skips office he and larry open a couple beers
the door opens bobby enters wearing only a towel
you wanted to see me
yeah bobby shut the door
he does this is the toughest job a manager has
beat but the organization has decided to make a change skip i know im in a slump but i hit the ball hard tonight right at em
a couple flares drop in and im back in the groove
the nearly naked year old man pleads helplessly his career is over
the players exit the groupies wait in a cluster
the wives wait in another group
bobbys wife sees bobby
to child theres daddy
wave to daddy
bobby coming out of the clubhouse another player has his arm around bobby consoling him
the wife knows
the durham bulls team bus is parked
luggage is loaded
sleepy players arriving escorted by wives and girlfriends
annie bids nuke goodbye off to the side
she pulls something from her handbag and hands it to nuke
a pair of womens red panties with lace and frills
i want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch
theyll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that youll start seeing things differently plus theyll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those
jesus annie i dont know youve been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain
thesell help move things to the right side
big league pitchers dont use these
they did when they were in the carolina league
nuke stuffs the panties in his pocket bewildered
a small kiss from annie and he hurries to the bus
players throw their gear into their travel bags
a paper beer cup is taped to the wall with a sign married men deposit wedding rings here for road trips
close on the cup a ring is dropped in and another and
we begin hearing annies voice over a woman should never ask questions about road trips
the team bus pulls out wives and girlfriends head back to their apartments leaving annie walking back rome several blocks to her house
men dont realize that women always know when theyve been unfaithful
beat the fact is upon exact moment of penetration the woman knows
as annie walks back through durham
the team bus rolls through the north carolina landscape
this sort of spiritual awareness can be a mixed blessing especially if youre dating a ballplayer
i believe a woman oughta take care of her man so thoroughly that he can go on the road for a few days without having the desire to search out
another pair of panties self aware that is probably however my most ridiculous belief
sigh i just hope the boys start winning soon
in some profound way i fear that a last place team is a reflection on its women
the bus rolls through north carolina
skip sits in the front of the bus doing a crossword puzzle
larry reads a book how to make a million dollars in real estate with no money down
deke turns up his tape deck george jones sings he stopped loving her today
mickey turns up his tape deck across the aisle aretha franklin sings r e s p e c t
deke turns his volume louder mickey does likewise and soon we have dueling tape decks
c w going head to head with r b
skip leaps to his feet whirls and shouts
i got one word to say to you shut up
and then from the back of the bus some soft gentle but slightly dissonant guitar chords
the back of the bus nuke sits across the aisle from crash whos re reading thomas pynchon
nuke has a guitar and is struggling with some chords to try a little tenderness
he butchers the chords and the words
singing softly oh she may get wooly women do get wooly because of all the stress
in disgust gimme that
crash strongarms the guitar from nuke
i hate people who get the words wrong
it aint woolly its weary and it nobodys got stress theyre wearing a dress
crash whips through the first few bars of the song
sings softly oh she may be weary young girls do get weary wearing the same old dress
he shoves the guitar back at nuke
how come you dont like me
cause you dont respect yourself which is your problem but you dont respect the game and thats my problem
beat you got a gift
what do i got
when you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt
nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously
you got a hall of fame arm but youre pissing it away
i aint pissing nothing away i got a porsche already
a with a
and a quadraphonic blaupunkt
you dont need a quadraphonic blaupunkt you need a curve ball
beat in the show everybody can hit the fastball
you been in the majors
tony and deke overhear this and turn around
and crash gets wistful lyrical and even slightly hopeful
i was in the show for days once
beat it was the greatest days of my life
you never touch your luggage in the show somebody else handles your bags
beat the ballparks are like cathedrals the hotels all have room service the women have long legs and brains its a smorgasbord
the women are hot eh
yeah and so are the pitchers
they throw ungodly breaking stuff in the show exploding sliders
nuke tony and deke murmur in awe at crashs pronouncement
you could be one of those guys but you dont give a fuck meat
god damn it im sick of you calling me meat
you wanta step outside
crash hops to his feet as the bus barrels along grabbing nuke by the collar
yeah lets go
nuke quickly has second thoughts crash can be terrifying
wait a minute
calm down crash
nuke sits back down
reaches for a baseball sitting nearby
he hands the ball to crash
teach me how to throw a breaking ball
crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly as i was saying ya hold it like an egg
as the bus rolls through the country a late s olds convertible roars past max patkin at the wheel
he waves at the team bus and honks
the opening bars on the national anthem oh say can you see and max roars off through the rolling green landscape
hit hank williams music to play over max patkin coaches third in his comic routine now for the winston salem team as durham is in the field
a winston salem batter lines a double off the wall
teddy the announcer re creates the game for broadcast with a several second delay
his assistant p
announcer from the ballpark has a phone to her ear and writes down each play on a piece of paper holding it up for teddy who enhances shamelessly in his
on the air play by play
close on paper his assistant writes double to left
teddy hits a tiny mallet against a jar
the sound of ball hitting bat
he punches one of several tape cassettes cued up
a crowd roars
an array of special effects is at his fingertips
on the air double off the wall by higgins and once again the durham pitchers are unable to get the first out of the inning
thunk the mallet again
on the air line drive to center a diving stab by mcfee ohhhh
ball gets by his glove another run in and the crowd loves it punches a cassette a crowd roars
the bus rolls through a small town
the team bus pulls in players stagger off half asleep
on the air bulls will attempt to end a six game losing streak against the greensboro astros with nuke laloosh on the hill
nuke dresses for the game he pulls the red panties out of his bag
looks around the clubhouse
nobody sees them
hes embarrassed anyway and stuffs them back
nuke winds and delivers the batter swings and teddy and his assistant a note is held up single thunk the mallet strikes
on the air base hit centerfield off laloosh
his assistant on the phone scrawls another quick note
thunk thunk thunk a rapid sequence of the mallet striking the percussive box and on the air that closes the book on laloosh today earned runs hits strikeouts walks wild
skip removes nuke from the game and he heads for the showers
annie sits with millie at the kitchen table listening to the radio
millie consoles her
nuke in the showers alone letting the water run over him
the voice of teddy an the air editorializing shamelessly
on the air its time to tell it like it is sports fans and this is the most wretched road trip ive seen in years and possibly the worst durham
team in half a century
beat where are the great bull players of yesteryear
where are the footsie blakes the digger odells the gus palowitzes
teddys voice plays over road trip images nuke starts to put on the red panties changes his mind and hides them again
the team bus rolling across north carolina
the team bus at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in the smoky mountains
sack after sack of fast food is passed through the window to skip
the team bus pulls into yet another hotel and this time a bus with a sign holiday on ice pulls in next to them
on the air is the modern athlete a pale imitation of the great old warriors
only crash davis stands out this year begging the question what are these boys thinking about cause it sure aint baseball
as the players rise in the bus deke is trying to work up excitement about the holiday on ice bus from which twenty great looking women ice skaters are getting
holiday on ice girls getting off the bus
thats what we need yknow one night with some skaters and we can get back on track
we need a night off just to stop our losing streak
we need a rainout
i can get us a rainout
its degrees there aint been a cloud in the sky in weeks
hundred bucks says i can get us a rainout tomorrow
a cab pulls up in the dark
late at night
the cab leaves and the four men climb over the fence
crash pulls the lid off a box several valve handles
crash turns several handles with an iron bar and
the sprinkler system comes to life and suddenly the field is covered with the clicking of rain bird sprinklers throwing long slow arcs of water across the entire field
the four players sit on the scoreboard watching the sprinklers flood the field
a six pack is passed around
a quagmire on the infield the kingston general manager stands in the muck with his ground crew
wheelbarrows shovels sand is piled around
god damn it
we cant get it ready by game time boss
the general manager studies the field
he looks up at the sky
to his assistant call the radio and the paper
with disgust the games been rained out
organ music the blue danube waltz
holiday on ice in its matinee performance
the beautiful leggy women skating to the blue danube waltz
ten of the durham bulls sit in the front row
nuke deke tommy others but not crash
tony waves to a skater
the skater waves back as she swirls past the bulls
deke ices the champagne in the b
tommy is blow drying his hair
mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit
several other players get ready to party
i blew a whole days meal money for this champagne seven dollars man it better be good
for seven bucks it better be some serious shit
what time is it eh
when are they coming
the guys lounge around nervously trying to be casual
close on a steak dinner set down in front of crash
nuke hands crash a hundred dollar bill
this is from tony for the rainout
cmon man lets go to the party
theres ice skaters coming
you ever made love to an ice skater
by the dozen
holiday on ice ice capades ice follies beat im through with one night stands

nuke just stares at him
youre weird man i want a ice skater real bad

nuke looks at him strangely and hurries to the party
the guys are grooming to excess still blow drying and preening for each other
a knock at the door
they quickly get casual and lounge seductively
its them its them
calling out come in
the door opens its nuke
hey guys pa rty

mickey lounges with a drink and a cigaret

nuke leans on the bar with an elbow striking his version of a lounging pose
you got it
a knock at the door
eight ice skaters stand in the doorway ready to
pop the cork on the seven dollar champagne and party
the wives and some girlfriends watch dynasty on annies television
annie hosts filling their drink glasses serving popcorn and largely staying in the background
do you think your husband plays around on the road trips
do we have to talk about that
i guess not
its just that once i asked mickey if he was faithful to me on the road trips and he said in his heart he was faithful
beat what the hell does that mean
it means hes unfaithful but only a man would put it in those words
a baby cries tommys wife lifts a baby from the couch begins rocking it
players are dancing drinking hustling the ice skaters the music is up the party swinging when skip enters hes steaming and slightly drunk
larry is with him
i just got one word to say to everybody shut up
the players and ice skaters freeze in mid party
nuke get everybody in here

nuke pounds on doors in a hurry
in first door jimmy is on his knees at the bed bare chested praying with an open bible

hundred dollar fine if youre not in in five
jose and tony look at the two women its a lot of money in class aaa ball
jose and tony hurry out in their shorts

and nuke hurries down the hall pounding on each door
crash eating alone peacefully
nuke arrives excitedly
skip wants everybody in for a team meeting
hundred buck fine if ya dont show
crash pulls out the hundred dollar bill and hands it to him
party without me
god what a big league move
nuke takes the money and hurries back
players and ice skaters some of the players nuke rounded up are partially dressed
skip spots the women

looking around wheres crash
nuke steps forward hands skip the hundred dollar bill
he cant make it

aw christ he dont have to come

i believe in a double standard for guys hitting
beat look men you got a choice
you wanta be roasting your nuts off for midas muffler welding exhaust pipes up the assholes of cadillacs
or beat you wanta be sitting in the caddy while some other guys crawling around in a monkey suit with a blow torch
beat theres only two places you can be in life in the caddy or under it
nearly pleading these are the best years of your lives
these are the glamor days
beat it dont got any better than this
threatening tough but
if this club dont start winning soon theres gonna be changes made
close on television dynasty drones on
wistfully deke was a great player in high school
i thought held go right to the major leagues i was gonna be a big league wife
beat pass the pampers please
helluva guy silence
crash flips off the t
with the remote
can i ask you something
what would you think of a pitcher who wore womens panties
if he had a good breaking ball id respect the shit outta him
crash turns off the light
close on nuke a bit of light spill on his face
a long ways from sleep
close on nukes face he takes his cap off wipes his brow
everything in slo mo
fans in the ballpark laugh at nuke mocking his
extreme close up on nukes eyes frightened
slow fullback on nuke hes stark naked save for his cap and glove
everyone else is clothed
nuke winds and pitches in the nude
and as the batter cranks up to take a vicious swing close on nukes face he awakes with a start
crash leans over and shakes him
wake up its okay
crash helps nuke back to consciousness
nuke shakes his head trying to wake up
crash is almost tender
i was playing naked
i know i know i have that dream all the time
were almost home
the bus continues across the carolina landscape
the team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot
a few of the players cars are parked
some of the wives and girlfriends
the players shuffle off the bus
tired and beat
close on nuke he looks worse than the rest
he sees annie and waves
shes waiting next to her old volvo
annies volvo pulls out she drives
annie is up nuke is down
god im tired
what a trip i was lousy
i was worse than lousy
everytime i pitched it was like throwing gasoline on a fire
what is this i i i stuff
you only talk about yourself
arent you glad to see me
dont i look nice
you look great
im totally exhausted
total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous
beat lets play catch
flowers and birdfeeders everywhere
and feet away in complete oversized catchers gear jackson in a catchers crouch nuke stares in his street clothes but now with a glove and ball
hum babe hum babe fire it in here hum babe thats not necessary jackson beat okay nuke now lean in for the sign
jackson flashes some ridiculous signs
this in ridiculous
im a pro
just do what i say
now which nostril are you breathing through
which nostril am i breathing through
annie puts her hand under his nose
the right nostril
my right nostril
there are two important psychic conduits called the pingala and the ida
the pingala starts with the left testicle or left ovary of the female and ends at the right nostril
she touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of fact manner
he stares back
the ida originates at the right testicle or ovary and terminates at the left nostril
im really beat
i need some serious zs the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball
beat and if you discover before a game youre in the wrong nostril its easy to switch
okay fire a couple in there
nuke tosses an easy pitch to jackson
youre patronizing me
i will not be patronized if i throw too hard ill hurt the kid
hes handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six
nuke gets a little steamed
he feels his nostril winds and fires a medium speed fastball to jackson
a bit angry how was that
a little better
gimme the god damn ball
nuke winds up and fires a pitch to jackson
alas the ball sails through a window crashing glass
cynically how ya like that
your delivery was fully integrated because you werent thinking about it cause you were pissed off at me
beat this is progress
nuke smiles and gives in
and reaches for her
i give up
lets go inside make love and fall asleep till its time to go to the ballpark
she takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch
taking his hand we could just take that sexual energy and save it for a few hours and re channel it into your pitching tonight
shouting cmon jackson ive got some lemonade
jackson runs over in full gear to join them
sitting on the back porch a pitcher of lemonade
i cant keep up with you
first you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher now no sex is gonna do it
its all the same thing
suddenly nukes face is filled with alarm he points
a cardboard box on a table nearby scrawled in larged letters on the side are the words max patkin
matter of factly thats max
his ashes anyway
he left no kin
nuke stares unsettled
i think im gonna be sick oh dont be silly
death is nothing to be scared of
its just another way of living
its just a fresh start kinda like spring training
nuke thinks about this carefully
looks at the ashes at annie and at jackson in full gear mask on his head
death is like spring training
and so is birth
now look me in the eyes nuke sweetly accusing him you havent been wearing my panties have you
close on nuke utterly bewildered
nuke pulls his jockstrap on over the red panties
crash notices the panties and snaps the waistband
nuke looks around nervously continues dressing quickly
annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while im on the mound thus keeping my brain slightly off center which is where it should be
for artists and pitchers
she also said i should throw whatever pitches you call for
annies a smart lady
suddenly deke spots nukes panties
hey fruit alert
check out the rook
several players gather around wolf whistles aimed at nuke as the players are dressing into their uniforms
annie says theres no such thing as straight and gay
were all sexual creatures to start with and we get formed into certain roles
you believe that
when im one and six ill believe anything
as they dress annie also says that god is a woman
you believe that crash you think gods a lady
gods definitely a woman but shes no lady
this is all commie bullshit
beat god has a dick man
god damn it jimmy youre an expert does god have a dick or a pussy
jimmy turns from his cubicle to answer the theological question
ll heads wait for the answer
the lord god is tri une father son and holy ghost
father and son
the guys slap fives convinced god is a man
baiting them yeah but he is a brother
god aint no brother
deke turns to crash full of despair
if there is a god why am i hitting
suddenly skip and larry appear to restore order
this is a damn noisy clubhouse for a team thats lost straight
skip takes off his cap instantly sincere
patkin was a tribute to baseball
and one helluva guy
a black gospel group at a mike at home plate singing singing i come to the garden alone when the dew is still on the roses and the voice i
hear whispering in my ear
the son of god discloses annie sprinkles maxs ashes on the pitchers mound as jackson sits in the dugout filling rosin bags with the extra ashes from a box
extreme close up max rosin bag on the mound
nuke on the mound picks up the rosin bag and paces
a small crowd
a batter steps in to hit
nuke looks in for the sign
god these panties feel great
that dont make me queer right
reads the sign breaking ball
nuke winds and delivers breaking ball for a strike
i aint queer
i know i aint
reads the sign fastball
nuke winds and delivers fastball for a strike
annies box seat in the stands she charts pitches
ninety three miles an hour
he looks wonderful jackson
nuke on the mound he looks in for the sign
whys he want the heat i just threw heat
dont think meat give em the gas
nuke winds and delivers an eye popping fastball
the batter swings and misses
in the dugout skip and larry look at each other warily
jesus whats got into nuke
i heard hes wearing womens underwear and hes breathing through his pingala nostril
spitting tobacco im getting too old for this game
nukes fastball shatters a bat the hitter hits a weak roller to third for the second out
back to the mound nuke is pumped up
god annies got a great ass
how come her panties fit me
thats one of the mysteries of sex i guess
nuke winds and delivers a vicious curveball a check swing dribbler to first for the third out
and the players run into the dugout
nuke puts on his warm up jacket and sits down next to crash whos taking off his gear readying to hit
i was great eh
your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging in the show they woulda ripped you
cant you let me enjoy the moment
the moments over
rising to get a bat if this guy starts me off with a breaking ball im going downtown crash smiles in his disarming way and grabs a bat
crash kneels rubbing the bat handle with pine tar
he studies the pitcher working the first two hitters
crash rises and heads to the plate
crash steps into the box digs in
i dare you to throw me the hammer you aint that stupid
in slow motion the pitcher winds and delivers
and as the ball leaves the pitchers hand breaking ball you fool
crash unloads on the pitch crushing a home run deep over the left field wall
teddy the radio announcer is wary about these events
two nothing bulls in the second first time the bulls have been ahead in weeks eh whitey beat lets see if the real nuke laloosh will show up nuke fires
three quick pitches for another strike out
curve ball fast ball curve ball
annie and jackson in her box seat
skip and larry in the dugout skip looks at larry as if to say whats happening
larry just shrugs
back to the field nukes next pitch
the next batter pops up crash circles into foul ground to make the catch whipping the ball around the infield
and crash goes to the mound for a visit
hey im cruisin man whatre you doing out here
i want you to throw this one at the bat rack
im finally throwin the damn thing where i want to
itll keep the fear of god in the hitters

crash returns to the plate flashes a sign
the press box teddys getting worked up
a staggering start by laloosh hes thrown cuts on pitches all of them strikes hes got pin point control here tonight bull fans

the bull mascot dives for cover
the batter steps out of the box nervously muttering

close on nuke smiles
a change up
the batter swings terribly off stride strike three
crash whips the ball around the infield
top of the ninth two outs one out away from a stunning two hit shutout for laloosh
nuke on the mound bearing down
bear down meat dont let up

crash flashes the sign nuke doesnt like it
no no this guys looking for heat lemme give him the deuce nuke shakes off the sign cocky full of himself
annie and jackson in her box seat
oh no hes shaking off the sign jackson
this son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and hes shaking me off
to batter and umpire hey charlie here comes the deuce
nuke winds and delivers a hanging curveball
the batter takes an ungodly cut and blasts a long home
the batter stands at the plate watching the blast
until crash shoves him toward first with a sneer
for a moment it looks like therell be a fight but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as nuke stares at the outfield wall as the
batter circles the bases
crash walks to the mound
you told him i was throwing a deuce right
he really crushed that dinger didnt he
musta gone feet
nuke holds out his glove says nothing
crash puts a new ball in the glove
returns to the plate
nuke gets the sign winds
batter hits a weak one hopper back to the mound
a raucous celebration of the victory
and we begin hearing the familiar sounds of piaf
annie comes out of the bathroom dressed in a long flowing nightgown elegant and old fashioned
she looks fabulous presenting herself to nuke
yknow annie i been thinking if it works for one game maybe itll work for a whole buncha games
breathing through your pingala always works honey not that
i mean the re channeling of my sexual energy
beat maybe we shouldnt make love for awhile
now dont go overboard i look incredibly hot right
she strikes a pose
she does look hot
you know what it feels like to throw a three hitter
nervously with resolve we better not fuck
just till i lose
get over here
ebby calvin nuke laloosh she starts toward him and nuke flees
out the door into the night
annie slumps in disbelief
annie sits in bed alone lights a cigarette
a puzzled expression things have got out of control
nuke was so encouraged that he took a vow to not have sex until they lost
annie reaches over opens a drawer in her nightstand and pulls out her baseball glove
she cradles it fondly in her lap puts it on pounds it gently
ysee a ballplayer on a streak considers himself touched with magic and hell do anything to keep from breaking the spell
nuke neatly unfolds the red panties in his locker
in fact the whole team started making religious connections and everybody got hot
jose blesses the bats with a chicken bone cross
jimmy reads the bible and prays alone in the corner
players taking ground balls and batting practice
i figured nuke would win a couple then lose and things would get back to normal
players playing flip pepper like kids
but it didnt happen like that
and for one extraordinary june and july the durham bulls for whatever perverse reason began playing baseball with joy and verve and poetry nuke warming up in the bullpen listening
the two sides of my own brain were all jumbled up and cross wired
while one side was being neglected the other was in paradise watching our bulls play like big leaguers
mickey rips a triple up the alley slides into third
we swept a four game series with kingston back to back doubleheaders with winston salem and kicked the holy shit out of greensboro in a three game series
several players signing autographs at a local mall
a line of kids to meet them
a banner meet your bulls
they were in demand all over town and crash who kept hitting dingers was approaching the minor league record
though i told nobody
crash blasts another home run another win
july promotion larry deke tommy and jose dressed as the spirit of drum and fife corps at home plate surrounded by a boy scout troop
after sweeping a july doubleheader the durham bulls were tied for first
the wives the groupies and millie wait for the players outside the clubhouse following a game
annie sits alone in her box seat as the stadium empties
but beautiful as the winning streak was i was getting damn lonely
beat something had to be done
i needed a man
the sounds of diana ross and the supremes
larry deke tommy and mickey as the supremes singing stop in the name of love at the front of the bus
i love winning crash you hear me
i love it
teach me everything
its time you started working on your interviews
what do i gotta do
learn your cliches
theyre your friends
crash hands nuke a small pad and pen
write this down
beat we gotta play em one day at a time
thats the point
beat im just happy to be here and hope i can help the ballclub
write write i just wanta give it my best shot and good lord willing thingsll work out
nuke starts writing them down
good lord willing thingsll work out
so hows annie
nuke looks up from his cliches startled
shes getting steamed cause im still re channeling my sexual energy maybe i should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down
you outta your mind
if you give in now you might start losing
beat never fuck with a winning streak
nuke nods seriously listening to the master
the bus pulls in wives and girlfriends are waiting
the players get off greet their women
annie greets nuke they head for her volvo
jimmy starts across the lot on foot dragging his luggage when millie pulls up in her car
want a ride
nervously have you accepted jesus christ as your personal savior
can i give you my testimony
you can do anything you want
a tiny grin hop in
jimmy nervously gets in with millie they roar away
nuke sits at the table hes just finished eating
annie circles him
a pot of soup on the stove
im so proud of you and all the guys
want some more soup
no no it was great
how bout a back rub
no thats okay
all i needs a little nap
ill tuck you in
nervously you cant seduce me
im not gonna try to seduce you sweetie
annie stretches out her leg and lays it an the table
she pulls back her skirt slightly exposing her garter snaps attached to her stockings
thats my leg
i know what it is
i figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we dont make love
she strokes her leg
nuke stares fearfully
beat unsnap my stockings
nuke squirms then reaches for her garter snaps
crash once called a womans uh pussy yknow how the hair kinda makes a v shape
yes i do
well he calls it the bermuda triangle
he said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again
what a nasty thing to say
he didnt mean it nasty
he said that gettin lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do especially like that
beat crash is a very smart man
now cmon honey give it a try
nuke reaches for the garter snaps with two hands
he fumbles groping awkwardly
annie stops him gently
one hand with a single hand annie flicks each snap
flick flick flick
the snaps open effortlessly
annie re snaps them quickly offering her leg to nuke
now you try
nuke tries again one handed
awkwardly again but sighing sexually mmmmmmm
but nuke leaps to his feet reacting vigorously nervously desperately
the soup crashes on the floor
youre playing with my mind
im trying to play with your body
i knew it youre seducing me
of course im seducing you for godsakes and im doing a damn poor job of it beat arent i pretty
i think youre real cute
i hate cute
baby ducks are cute
i wanta be exotic and mysterious
youre exotic and mysterious and cute thats why i better leave
nuke starts to leave
you got things all wrong
theres no relation between sex and baseball
whatd he say
he said if i gave in to you id start losing again
ill be back when we lose
nuke hurries out the door annie just stares
a run of the mill cheap modern motel
crash works on his swing in front of a mirror
a knock at the door
annie enters the room
crash stays with his stance
i want you
nuke wont go to bed with you eh
hes confused arent we all
dont you think im pretty
crash puts down the bat and looks directly at her
as he does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins pumping them an he talks
youre gorgeous god damn it
from the moment i first saw you i knew i had to have you
i had to have you
i want to be had
i think of you and the boy all the time
he wont make love to me anymore
and hes right
a ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak
they dont happen very often
beat you know how hard this game is
if you believe youre playing well because youre getting laid or because youre not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties then you are
beat and i still think thomas pynchon is full of shit
i want you desperately
crash can hardly keep up
so he slows her down who are you
do you have a job
i teach part time at the junior college
what if i told you i was through with nuke
he learned his lessons quickly and left me
and now you wanta teach me
i dont imagine theres much i could teach you
i doubt that
crash i get wet just thinking about you
i thought you wanted an uncomplicated boy
im ready for a complicated man
and as soon as we lose a game hell be back in your arms
i said when i think about you i get wet
annie i think you should leave
annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self awareness
shes frustrated confused angry and
god damn you what is happening
is there no man wholl have me
beat this is the weirdest season i ever saw the durham bulls cant lose and i cant get laid
softly you okay
annie slides against the wall down to the floor
her makeup runs
her eyes are red
shakily i need a drink
crash gingerly helps her to her feet
annie and crash sit in the corner of the empty bar
sighs i was raised in a baptist church got dipped in the water when i was born again before kindergarten
by the time i was i knew it was bullshit and at i ran away from home
she smiles at the most painful memories
pregnant had an abortion got pregnant again had an abortion again
gave up men
my mother died
beat i bought a car for and drove to ft
lauderdale to bury her
beat and after wed sung some hymns in some wretched florida funeral home i went outside and something happened her tone becomes wistful nostalgic
the smell of cut grass in the warm march air overwhelmed me and i heard a noise makes the sound tok tok tok and some men shouting
then tok tok tok
crash smiles slightly
i crossed the street it was the new york yankees spring training field tok tok tok was the sound of a ball hitting a bat and i sat in the
warm bleachers to think about my mother
beat and i saw him
beat he was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody it was beautiful
beat and he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition
beat so i stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand whats so great about baseball
whats so great about baseball
if you know where home plate is then you know where st base is and nd and everything else cause theyre always in the same place in relation to home
beat dont you see
if you know where home plate is then you know where everything else in the universe is
i dont know if id go that far
its true its true
beat down least it used to be true
it aint possible that baseballs not enough anymore is it crash
are you gonna be waking up next to year old ballplayers when youre
i used to think that wasnt the worst thing in the world to look forward to
lately im not so sure
angrily whatta you mean why not
are you gonna play forever
before crash can answer suddenly a voice interrupts
they both turn to see millie excitedly dragging jimmy into the nearly empty bar
she leads him by the hand
there she is weve been looking all over for ya
millie leads jimmy right up to their table
and as they hold hands
jimmy stands there shyly
well tell em honey
nervously were getting married
millie sticks out her left hand displays a huge ring
omigawd honey im so happy for you
hes a virgin
jimmy squirms defensively
to annie and crash i guess that probably seems pretty corny to people like you
oh jimmy honey i think it sounds wonderful
annie will you be the brides maid
game in progress nuke on the mound
nuke winds and delivers very high
inside the dugout skip and larry spitting tobacco
nukes overthrowing tonight he dont look loose

annie holds the dress up to millie

line drive up the alleys gonna score at least two here comes the relay crash flips his mask a runner rounds third heading for home
here comes the throw on a line
it hits once on the infield grass takes a long hop as the runner barrels toward the plate crash takes the throw
the runner slides crash blocks the plate
a cloud of dust
a close play
the umpire signals safe and crash flips out
in a second he is nose to nose with the umpire
i got him on the knee

their faces are inches apart screaming face to face

the ump theatrically throws crash out of the game
annie and millie stare at the radio
ive never seen crash so angry and frankly bull fans he used a certain word thats a no no with umpires
crash musta called the guy a cocksucker god hes so romantic
crash stands against the water letting it stream across him
he raises a can of beer to his lips drinks it slowly in the shower
as the water runs over crash
when crash got throwed out the game got out of hand
beat jose made three errors with his cursed mitt
jose boots a ground ball a runner scores
nuke never quite got in the groove though he didnt pitch bad
nuke just misses with a pitch ball four
and the winning streak came to an end with a loss
beat the good news was that a man was about to come calling
the bad news was it was the wrong guy
as piaf plays on the stereo a knock at the door
annie goes to the door then refuses to answer it at first
she hides in a corner
bites her fist
you gotta be in there i can hear that crazy mexican singer
annie smiles slightly and opens the door
she opens the door fully
nukes father stands there
id like you to meet my father
surprised oh wont you come in
as they enter she leads them into the kitchen
ebbys told me a lot about you
beat can i offer you some coffee
she puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness
ebby tells me youre a very spiritual woman
he tells me youve taught him a lot about discipline and self control
annie and nuke exchange glances
hes a good student
we were worried that ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball were so pleased he met a christian woman
praise the lord eh
the piaf record begins skipping in the next room
oh my i better fix that
ebby will you help me
im no good with mechanical things nuke picks up his cue and follows her to annie fixes the record
i couldnt dump my old man but maybe later i can sneak away from him

crash says i gotta quit worrying about him cmon honey we got a lotta catching up to do he pins her to the wall she squirms away
nuke we do need to talk
nukes father is studying pictures on annies wall
close on a helmut newton photo a nude woman two afghans and a toilet
close on a poster of a marijuana leaf with the inscription better living through mexican agriculture
nukes father is a bit unsettled by all this when the phone rings
annie sweeps back into the kitchen saved by the bell to answer the phone
on phone hello
yeah as a matter of fact he is here
she hands the phone to nuke
its skip for you
yeah skip its me
several beats jeez
nuke hangs up the phone
looks at annie and his father

im going to the show
nukes father leaps to his feet and embraces his son
lets have a quick word of prayer right here to thank the lord for all this oh lets not
i gotta leave first thing in the morning
how can i possibly thank you
he embraces her rather formally
just pitch well and do good
nuke hustles his father out of the house
i will i will cmon dad ill dump you off
i gotta find crash
as they exit nukes father turns to annie god bless you
to herself she will mr
laloosh she will
annie sits down in a kitchen chair
an enormous sigh
nuke knocks on crashs door
tony is arriving with his groupie girlfriend to the next room
crash aint there
he never gets back till four or five where does he go
well id rather not say
they called me up to the show and i wanta tell crash goodbye
tony comes over and gives nuke a heartfelt five
goddamn thats great
beat listen crash dont like anybody to know it but beat most nights he goes down to you know down to niggertown
he goes to a whorehouse every night
dont tell him i told you hed break my neck
close on nuke disturbed
a cab moves slowly through a poor neighborhood
stops at an old house decades of ad hoc add ons
keep your extra cash in your shoes
nuke gets out and goes to the door
nuke knocks at the door a small barred window opens
a face appears a tough black sandy
whatyou want kid
im looking for somebody
looking for crash davis
im nuke laloosh
with the bulls
studying him your breaking balls getting better but ya need a change up
the door opens
nuke enters tentatively another world
the doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors
a black prostitute enters a room with a huge redneck
as they go down the hallway and as they do we begin hearing singing raucous soulful drunk
nuke stops in a doorway looks into the waiting room
several hookers in various stages of undress sit on couches and chairs
bored smoking ancient
the one white hooker a skinny year old accompanies on a guitar struggling to keep up
and a couple hookers are hanging around a piano that crash is playing and singing
he doesnt look up
crash is dressed but barefoot
a cigarette dangles from his mouth as he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords
two hookers at the piano hum along
singing and playing but when she does get weary try a little tenderness
nuke steps into the room all the hookers rise in anticipation of a new customer
crash keeps playing never looking up
singing you know shes waiting just anticipating the things that shell never possess
beat while shes there waiting try a little tenderness
nuke interrupts the instrumental passage crash
im going to the show
crash ignores him keeps playing
clubs expanding its roster to finish the season shut up
singing last bars oh you wont regret it young girls dont forget it lost in their own wilderness
beat but its all so easy just try a little tenderness
as crash plays on im going to the show
nuke grabs crash by the hair and jerks him to his feet
the two men are face to face
im trying to thank you
let go of me
nuke lets him go and crash staggers drunkenly against the piano regaining his balance as sandy rushes in with a gun to break it up
he makin trouble for you mr
no no sandy put it down
drunkenly to nuke nuke you know sandy grimes
hit at louisville in
cmon nuke you and me lets step outside and settle this
i dont wanta fight you i wanta thank you
lets have a drink and forget this god damn it you fucking virgin prick step outside
crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear
nuke reluctantly follows
several of the hookers follow to watch
crash is drunk and lost
nuke in control
cmon we got nothin to fight about
why am i a fuck
why are you a fuck
beat cause you got talent
i got brains
but you got talent
youre god damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year
drunken insight all my limbs put together are worth cents a pound and thats for science and dog meat
youre a great catcher
come over here into the light so i can kick your ass
okay ill kick your ass there
crash takes a step toward nuke
pulls up his bare feet quickly stepping on a sharp stone
i forgot my fucking shoes
honey go get my shoes
one of the hookers goes inside for his shoes
ill take you back to the hotel
drunken mad you know what the difference is between hitting
i got it figured out
beat twenty five hits a year in at bats is points
theres months in a season thats about weeks you get one extra flare a week just one a gork a ground ball with eyes a dying quail just one more
dying quail a week and youre in yankee stadium
the hooker finds crashs shoes starts to bring them out to him when
she notices cash in one of them
the hooker takes a few bills for herself and continues out back in the alley crash finishes his tirade as he struggles drunkenly to put them on
you aint worth thanking nuke starts to walk away crash fires his one free shoe at nuke hitting him in the back of the head
nuke whirls comes after crash
come on meat
crash swings wildly nuke ducks it and levels crash with a short right hand
crash crashes into some garbage cans lies there on his back for several beats
close on crash blood trickles from his mouth
tell me something
did you hit me with your right or your left
crashs next line is both drunk and sober and we dont know if hes just being clever or if somehow hes staged it all
maybe even he doesnt know
if ya get in a fight with some asshole never hit his with your pitching hand
ya might get injured
smiles thats another lesson for ya now quit fucking around and help me up
crash reaches up a hand for help nuke stares back
and finally nuke reaches down and helps crash to his feet
ya look like shit
the two men head inside
nukes porsche the clubhouse boy drags nukes out to the car and loads the trunk
annie larry and a couple kids and dogs are watching
nuke cleans out his locker filling his travel bag
crash sits on a stool next to him
sorry about last night
i have been known on occasion to howl at the moon
dyou understand that
beat look nuke these big league hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile dont worry about it
be cocky and arrogant even when youre getting beat
thats the secret
beat you gotta play this game with fear and arrogance
fear and ignorance
fear and arrogance you hayseed not ignorance
smiles calmly i know
i just like to see you get all worked up
crash calms down
nuke nods and picks up his bags
knows its not true well i got annie all warmed up for ya
knows it is true shes just waiting for you to show up yknow
i dont need a crazy woman in my life
maybe you do
quick beat yknow im starting to like this game baseballs a helluva good way to make a living
crash speaks with quiet passion from his soul
its the best nuke
the absolute fucking best
yeah thanks for everything
they shake hands and nuke heads out the door
nuke nuke stops good luck
a little arrogance and fear
nuke tosses his bag in the porsche and motions to annie
they step away from the others
well i guess this is it
smiles i wont be needing these anymore
nuke pulls annies red panties from his jacket pocket
the frilly silk lace is tattered
the panties have been through the mill
she accepts them graciously
neither will i
i think im ready for the show
ebby calvin nuke laloosh dont think too much
they look at each other awkwardly sweetly and nuke kisses annie gently on the lips they hesitate and nuke heads for his porsche
crash arrives in the doorway to watch
nuke bids farewell to his father and climbs into his car
i gotta go now dad
i was thinking i could fly up and spend a week in the big leagues with you help you get comfortable
if i screw up i wanta do it alone
well be praying for you
dad if my curveball is hanging god aint gonna help me
well pray anyway
kindly if it makes you and mom feel better go for it
i gotta run they shake hands and crashs p
nuke roars away in his porsche leaving a trail of dust in the stadium parking lot
millie and jimmys wedding a formal wedding on the pitchers mound
millie in white
jimmy in his uniform
skip is the best man also in uniform and several players and groupies are the attendants annie as the brides maid
organ music plays the wedding march
jimmy lifts millies veil and kisses her
the stands are full of fans
jimmy leads millie down the aisle towards home plate
close on scoreboard ninth inning
durham is leading by a score of to
jimmy is pitching he delivers
the batter rockets a line drive up the alley
a peninsula runner races from first rounding third trying to score
crash waits at the plate here comes the runner
here comes the throw
a close play
a terrible collision
crash goes rolling
the umpire waits and in a cloud of dust crash holds up the ball
the crowd roars jimmy jumps victoriously in the air
the air of victory
the mood is up and goofy
beer cans are squirted at jimmy the groom
i wanta thank everybody and the lord for the victory its a wonderful way to celebrate my marriage and i guess were all back on a winning streak he
a few raucous fuckin as from the team
hey jimmy we chipped in and kind got a little gift for ya of a special wedding cake from the durham bulls
deke carries out an wedding cake its x rated
the decorative bride and groom are fucking
jimmys embarrassed but its all good natured
crash coming out of the shower toweling off watching the innocent vulgar fun
he sits down in front of his locker drying his hair when the clubhouse boy approaches hey crash skip wants to see ya
crash rises and heads for skips cubicle wearing only a towel and his shower shoes
inside skips office skip and larry sit in postgame routine checking charts smoking half dressed
crash enters as hes still drying off
yeah skip you wanted to see me
crash shut the door
and it hits him
crash looks at skip who looks down at the floor unwilling to face crash who then looks at larry who also looks away nervously
crash shuts the door the party rages beyond
heartfelt this is the toughest job a manager has
close on crash hes been in the game too long to be surprised nonetheless hes surprised
his stoicism is professional
the organization wants to make a change
now that nukes gone they wanta bring up some young catcher
some kid hittin
probably a bust
i put in a word for you with the organization told em i thought youd make a fine minor league manager someday
might be an opening at salem next year extreme close up on crash his eyes are moist
helluva year crash you know how it is
crash stands there nearly nude
he just nods slightly
without rancor or bitterness he turns and re enters the raucous locker room
crash walks the streets alone crash stops in front of a window and takes his batting stroke studying the reflection
crash drinking alone at the end of a bar
crash wanders along into the residential neighborhoods
he starts across a quiet intersection stops
looks at the street signs
he changes direction walks on
the windows glow
crash stares at the house hesitates then walks up the porch stairs
knocks at the door
moments later annie opens the door she looks beautiful
almost as if she was expecting him
at first silence
then i got released
i heard already
she opens the door crash enters annies house
annie puts on her favorite piaf record
annie pours a drink for both of them
crash puts a hand on her hip annie closes her eyes a tiny gasp
he kisses her forehead
she kisses his neck
a tiny smile from crash
the same from annie
she kisses him on the corner of his mouth
her hand finds the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his hair
crash responds they kiss slowly deeply
as his hand on her hip pulls up her skirt by degrees the skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg
at last exposing the beloved black garter snaps crashs hand expertly holds up the skirt and effortlessly unsnaps the garter with a minimum of effort
flick flick flick the garter snaps are free
the bedroom crash carries annie to the bed
annies foot kicks over a lamp onto the floor
annies blouse front flick flick flick
crash unbuttons it with one hand in seconds
even annie is startled with the speed and ease of crashs hand
her hand slides under the waistband of his underwear his hand slides up under her panties
a full embrace on the edge of the bed remnants of clothes cover parts of their bodies
they tumble out of control to the floor
annies hand grabs onto a dresser leg a carved oak antique her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser
the dresser top shakes makeup bottles and pictures and dozens of annies special things rattle and fall annies read rests on crashs stomach post coital they lie on the floor
blissfully as piaf finishes
annie changes the record to hank williams
the kitchen annie and crash eat an after mid after sex snack
crash eats a bowl of wheaties
they each wear one of her robes
annie sits munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana she keeps in a victorian jewel box
so you see in a former lifetime im sure that i was alexandria the czarette of russia
what do you think
how come in former lifetimes everybody was someone famous
beat how come nobody ever says they were joe schmo
it doesnt work like that
stares at him god youre gorgeous
want to dance
they kiss again and fall gradually onto the table top
annie sits on top of crash lying on the kitchen table
he stretches out a leg and kicks the bowl of cereal to the floor
it smashes ceramics milk cereal go everywhere
as they start making love again in the glaring kitchen light
crash and annie dance in her living room
the bedroom crash is handcuffed to the bed
he seems perfectly happy as annie reads walt whitman
mouth tongue lips teeth roof of the mouth jaws and the jaw hinges
annie handcuffed to the bed crash reads
wrist and wrist joints hand palm knuckles thumb fore finger finger joints finger nail
crash at annies record collection he thumbs through it quickly puts on a new record
the dominoes sing sixty minute man
the bathroom candlelight around the bathtub
all we can make out is two heads two bodies sloshing wildly in the dim glow
water splashes dowses some candles
crash and annie in bed reading each with a copy of a thomas pynchon novel
crash tosses it aside
and disappears under the sheets playing with her as she struggles to keep reading
she puts down the book
annie applying eye makeup to crash who doesnt resist seems even amused
he kisses her deeply slowly
she kisses him back
they fall onto the bed
out the kitchen window dawn
a bird chirps
and we hear a record skipping repeating endlessly
pan across the kitchen overturned chairs spilled and broken cereal bowls liquor bottles
pan across the bedroom a disaster
clothes scattered across the floor overturned lamps the bed lies at a cockeyed angle
annie and crash lie face down asleep utterly spent
crash wakes up slowly reaches up and pulls his underwear off of a lampshade pulls them on and gets slowly out of bed
he staggers across the bedroom floor stumbling a bit into the living room he stumbles across the trashed room
record album covers more liquor bottles pillows cushions pictures hanging crookedly on the wall
crash takes the skipping record off the player and breathes a sigh of relief
he sees his pants lying on the floor and pulls them on
crash opens a drawer pulls out a piece of paper and a pencil
he starts writing
sun streams in
annie opens her eyes
reaches over for crash
her hand hits a note
only a note
she sits up with a start and reads the note
crash said he had to get an early start to drive to asheville in the south atlantic league where he heard they might need a catcher to finish out the
zoom in extreme close up of note love crash
crash in his car heading for asheville
crash knocking on the baseball office door looking for work
crash unloading his gear into yet another locker
annie scrubbing her kitchen floor down on her hands and knees picking up the broken cereal bowl
the house smelled like sex for days
it was wonderful
the only real cleaning i did was on the kitchen floor cause who likes to walk on spilt cereal
she finds a bit of a joint on the floor as shes cleaning
she picks it up sits on the floor under the table and lights the tiny joint
the funny thing is i stopped worrying about nuke
somehow i knew nothing would stop him
crash was right nuke had a gift
nuke in street clothes in the dugout of an empty stadium
hes being interviewed by a big league reporter who has a small tape deck and has stuck mike in nukes face
like a big leaguer yknow im just happy to be here and hope i can help the ballclub
i just want to give it my best shot and good lord willing thingsll work out
gotta play em one day at a time yknow
the big league reporter nods attentively as nuke knowingly delivers the cliches like a veteran
in sharpest contrast to the big league stadium a rickety old wooden grandstand carved into the pine covered hillside
crash steps to the plate in a uniform weve never seen him in of course
the asheville tourists
he picks up some dirt rubs it on his hands
hes as intense as ever
still playing for keeps
at the plate cmon meat throw me that weak ass shit cmon bring the heat bring it bring it
slo mo as the pitcher winds and delivers a fastball right down the pipe
annie lies in bed reading she suddenly jerks up
i was reading in bed when crash hit his th home run
i knew the moment it happened
crash unloads a monstrous home run deep into the trees
he stands at home plate watching it
like reggie or the babe
and doesnt move
for several seconds he indulges himself uncharacteristically until
the opposing catcher shoves him toward first
get your ass in gear
crash smiles and takes the home run trot slowly
as he heads toward first he raises a clinched fist for a brief moment a tiny gesture of triumph
and then routinely he just circles the bases
a hundred fans applaud routinely as he circles the bases
she lights a candle for the home run
above the candles displayed in the shrine are her red panties
i lit a candle for crashs dinger
and tried to root the durham bulls home to a pennant
annie and jackson open an umbrella in her familiar place in the stadium
umbrellas go up all around as the rains come the players huddle in the dugouts
in the dugout skip and larry reading copies of the tantric yoga of sex
and spitting tobacco
the kid from lynchburg wasnt good enough to hold crashs jockstrap if ya ask me and nukes replacement had a fastball that i coulda hit beat we had a three
game lead with two weeks to go when the rains came
the ground crew drags tarps over the mound and the plate
it rained and rained and i thought of driving down to asheville to see crash but then i thought no what you pursue eludes you
i had to trust quantum physics and the church of baseball
beat it aint always easy being this religious
annie and jackson pop open their umbrellas and walk out of the ballpark towards home
annie and jackson under umbrellas he turns down one street she heads toward home
as she approaches she stops
crashs beat up car in the driveway
crash sitting on the porch swing still raining
close on annie she hesitates and smiles
annie sits down on the porch owing next to crash
hit my dinger and hung em up
a moment of silence over the significance of him quitting
im quitting too
boys not baseball
there might be an opening for a manager at salem next spring
where all the witches were
you a witch
it takes years of practice
he smiles slightly and takes her hand
you think i could make it to the show as a manager
youd be great just great
rattling quickly cause you understand non linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game cause of the lines and the box scores an all but the
fact is that theres a spacious non time kind of time to it
interrupting annie what
i got a lotta time to hear your theories and i wanta hear every damn one of em
but right now im tired and i dont wanta think about baseball and i dont wanta think about quantum physics
i dont wanta think about nothing
beat i just wanta be
i can do that too
he rises takes her hand and they head inside
and as the rains fall on durham
the shrine glows candles everywhere
rain pours down on the windows outside
annie and crash sit on the couch together in silence
walt whitman once said i see great things in baseball
its our game the american game beat he said it will repair our losses and be a blessing to us
beat you could look it up
the music dave frishberg sings van lingle mungo
