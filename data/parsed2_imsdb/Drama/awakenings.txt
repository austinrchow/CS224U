scree nplay by steven ai ian based on t he book by olive r sac ks
a dusty deserted street saloon livery stable sunset
only there is something unsettling about it all
the colors are too muted and the angles not quite in perspective
pulling slowly back eventually reveals the edges of a narrow wooden picture frame
drifting away from the painting and slowly across a room
across venetian blinds open letting in moonlight across intricate handmade wooden models dime novels and comic books across the arm of a metronome gently slapping back and forth and settling
finally on a small hand writing slowly and deliberately over and over in synchronization it seems to the rhythm of the metronome the word l e o n a r d
the pendulum of a clock
an adult hand placing a bowl of cereal on a table
leonard ten or eleven waits a moment for the adult to leave grasps his spoon and manipulates it from bowl to mouth in time with the soft regular rhythm of
schoolbooks slung over their shoulders leonard and another boy his age a classmate move along a street
all around them are visual rhythms lines in the sidewalk the even placement of trees the sunlight breaking through the branches above them and somewhere unseen the rhythmic pounding of
an elevator train
as they climb a fence a pocket watch leonards falls to the ground
an adult hand chalking the words of a poem on a blackboard
children at desks dutifully transcribing the lesson
all but one
whose hands are trembling slightly and whose paper is blank
there is a noticeable lack of rhythms
a cold silence
the broken watch rests on his desk
the boy from the train glancing at leonard begins gently tapping the end of his pen against his desk
leonard guided by the cadence of his friends tapping begins to write
o the teachers hand at the blackboard hesitates
the rhythmic noise he traces it to the offender and silences him with a look
without the rhythm and without apparently inner natural rhythms to replace it leonards hand begins dragging the pen across the paper forming vague scrawl each word less defined than the
last until they begin melding together into what resembles nothing so much as a childs rendering of ocean waves
the teacher resumes chalking on the board
the boy from the train begins tapping his pen again and guided again by the rhythm leonard is able to give definition to the ocean waves to form recognizable letters
the teacher hesitates again and glares at the boy making the irritating noise
the boy stops tapping and leonards writing again becomes formless
the finished poem on the blackboard
the sounds of children at play on the schoolyard
the teacher alone in the classroom o at his desk grading the penmanship lesson
he circles offending errors on the last page of the last composition book
he scribbles a grade opposite the students name in a grade book
he notices the absence of a grade in leonards column
the teacher locates the missing composition book buried under textbooks
he takes it back to his own desk opens it and stares curiously at the last lesson the poem or rather leonards illegible representation of it
he considers earlier lessons in the book
he begins to see in the script a pattern of deterioration
he reaches the last entry again and stares at the few recognizable words drowning in the waves
the painting on the wall
the intricate wooden models and dime novels
the venetian blinds closed shutting out sunlight
voices barely audible from somewhere else in the house when can i see him
when hes well
when will he be well
after a moment i dont know
and the sound of a door closing
a small twisted hand lifts a slat of the venetian blinds revealing the snow patched street below
leonards friend crossing it glances back
then disappears around a corner
and the small gnarled hand lets the slat slide down extinguishing the single ray of light
tight on the face of a man sayer late thirties glasses staring up at the face of a building imposing in its institutional dullness
a dim sleepy cavern of a lobby
no one but a switchboard operator thumbing through a magazine
echoing footsteps reach her station and she glances up and at the man from outside
he seems uncomfortable
perhaps its the suit
or the place
or the situation
or the hard straight backed chair hes in
when he does finally speak its with great sincerity when you say people
you mean living people
behind an old oak desk the hospitals director glances over to its chief of medicine dr
kaufman with a look that seems to wonder as opposed to what
living people yes
theres some mistake
and sayers chair begins to feel more uncomfortable
he tries to clear up the confusion i m here for the research position
in your neurology lab
he doesnt laugh at sayer just at the thought of it
we have an x ray room
sayer tries to share the directors amusement with a good natured smile but doesnt really understand it
kaufman seems to have less time for this and in plain english unadorned the position ds staff neurologist
sayer looks like a man whos just learned that everything he knows about the world is wrong
f pause a doctor
the director refers to stapled sheets of paper in his hands sayers resume
the camel institute
tell me about that anything with patients there
burying it earthworms
the director isnt sure he heard right
it was an immense project
i was trying to extract a decigram of myelin from four tons of earthworms
i was on it for five years
i was the only one who really believed in it
the rest of them said it couldnt be done
t it cant
well i know that now
i proved it
the director offers a slow tentative nod before consulting the resume again
at saint thomas
sayer is already shaking his head no all research
theyre quite similar to human brains
hopefully are they
as the director retreats back to the resume hoping against hope of finding in it something germane sayer glances away to a window
he wishes he were outside it
he has no business being here
he should leave
excuse me i made a mistake coming here
clearly youre looking for someone with more of a clinical background
he stands up to leave
kaufman stands to see him out
but the director keeps searching the resume
ive taken enough of your time
you must have a hundred applicants more suitable
back in medical school
kaufman shoots the director a look that says no were not that desperate
i mean you couldnt have graduated without some clinical experience
and eventually manages sort of a shrug and a n od
v well there we are doctor
kaufman cant believe it but is sent back a look that says we have no choice
the director gets up out of his chair and smiling broadly extends his hand to sayer
which unsettles sayer
which in turn unsettles the director
not far from v begging you do want the job dont you
sayer isnt so sure
he thinks about it long and hard
moving along a corridor crowded with patients some ambulatory some in wheelchairs living people living with profound neurological disease
spent much time in chronic hospitals doctor
a patient approaches and passing sayer and the orderly whos escorting him anthony offers hello
to sayer youd remember
i guess not
as they pass an old patient in a wheelchair hey how you doing
calling to someone down the hall dr
staying on the old patient he eventually manages too late fn
ie down the hall in an alcove dr
sullivan glances up long sufferingly from a
ouij a board who
s mumbling complaining unintelligibly
anthony and sayer arrrive
sullivan this is dr
theres a kind a deadness in sullivans eyes and voice hes been here too long
not the neurologist thatd be asking too much
youre not the neurologist
i think i am
sayer extends his hand
instead of shaking it well come on anthony get him a coat for christs sake
sullivan thrusts his clipboard into sayers hand
a woman in a wheelchair uttering high pitched screams female patient
sayer in a lab coat trying to calm her
theyre just pencils pens
he tries to prove it to her by removing one of them from the pocket of his white coat
screaming louder at the sight of it she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being beaten senseless
a man in his sixties confronts sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice x was born in i f in kinasbridae new york
i came here in july of
prior to july of
i resided a the brooklyn psychiatric centerf brooklyn
prior to thatp i was a person
i who the hell are
stepping around a wheelchair sayer finds in it an elderly woman nicely dressed her hair done up a ribbon in it
glancing at the chart in his hand mrs
she smiles glances around
sayer hesitates uncertain who she means
i m here
pause to examine you
oh no i m leaving today
my sons coming to take me home
confused sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers on the clipboard
unsuccessful he excuses himself from her and crosses the room to a nurse
hes coming today
i wouldnt bet on it he hasnt for twenty years
the nurse turns away
sayer crosses slowly back to mrs
cohen trying to find the words to tell her
he doesnt have to his discomfort does it
her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair
institutional beige walls
glass cabinets locked containing medical instruments
a metal examination table with leather straps
sayer alone at one of three old desks in the large room still unsettled from the experience with mrs
eventually he gets up crosses to a window and tries to open it
its jammed shut painted shut perhaps but finally gives way sliding up
he lets the air from outside wash over his face as he stares out absently at children on an elementary school playground beyond a debris strewn field
a matter of fact it gets easier
sayer turns to the voice to miss costello the hospitals head nurse a veteran of this place a woman who has seen it all
shes standing in the doorway
you dont think it will but it does
a moment and she a urns and leaves
the needle of a victrola clawing at the endless music less inner bands of a
cold eggs and toast and prescription medicine on a kitchenette table
a puddle of coffee on the floor
ceramic shards a broken cup
an old woman on her knees eyes closed arms tangled in an aluminum walker limp and stiff at once somehow like the limbs of a discarded marionette
beyond her beyond a threshold a shuttered living room
furniture from another era and the clutter of a lifetime
a shadowy figure in a wicker wheelchair near the victrola
another old woman with spindly limbs profoundly afflicted and preposterously still
the back of her head is flat and bald the result of lying supine upon it for much of several decades
on her passive face rest round wire rim glasses
insane or retarded and unaware of the dead woman she mumbles just barely audibly a melody
can you hear me
distant music of childrens laughter
perhaps real emanating from outside perhaps imagined remembered playing in a remote region of the womans damaged mind
arrested of all movement she stares transfixed at the blades of a fan
do you know where you are
nothing back do you remember being brought here
nothing back do you know what has happened
if she does she gives no indication
no word or gesture
no change of expression on her mask of a face
she is elsewhere or nowhere cut adrift by her illness living in a private world or hell
can you hear me
sayer wearing a white lab coat tries to read her eyes
behind thick lenses uncleaned for weeks or months the eyes are inscrutable
lo sayer reaches to her face and carefully pulls the glasses from it
he cleans them with a flap of his lab coat they are loose bent out of shape and gently slides the temples back over her ears
he turns away from her and types at a manual underwood
the form in the machine at the top reads bainbridge hospital admissions consultation request neurology
sayer types in a lower section headed findings diagnosis
he turns back in his chair to find the woman doubled over in her wheelchair one arm very close to the floor the hand clutching the glasses
she is not moving but she has moved
that or she is dead
sayer rights her takes the glasses from her hand and slips them back onto her face
he studies her for a moment and for that moment remains as still as entranced as her
he takes the glasses from her face again and sets them on the floor
she doesnt retrieve them
he picks them up and holds them out to her
she doesnt move to take them
he lets go of them and she lunges forward catching them the instant before they hit the floor
sayer just stares
her name is lucy fishman
kaufman the hospitals chief of medicine notices a number of patients lined up in their wheelchairs as he passes them on his way into sayers examination room she was found
by neighbors with her sister several days after the sister had died
the same room as before
the same woman
all that has changed is the light
its late afternoon
according to the neighbors shes never set foot outside her apartment has no other living relatives and has always been the way she is now without any comprehension or response
kaufman tries to feign interest
he glances to the others sayer has summoned to the room two other doctors tyler and sullivan and miss costello
without any warning whatsoever sayer tosses a tennis ball at her
her hand suddenly jerks up out of her lap and catches it
and stays there stiff still
sayer is delighted but the expression on kaufmans face is that of one who has long ago learned and tired of simple card tricks
dismissing the phenomenon a reflex
if she batted it away i might call that a reflex
she doesnt bat it away she catches it
its still a reflex
im sorry if you were right id agree with you
kaufman understandably takes some offense at the comment
sayer however is unaware that he has caused any
its as if
having lost all will of her own on which to act she borrows the will of the ball
eventually the will of the ball
kaufman and the other doctors concur with glances that the theory and theorist are absurd
sullivan has better things to do and leaves the room
so does tyler
kaufman and miss costello remain
hopefully youre trying to make a good impression
thats it isnt it
youre still settling in
sayer isnt sure if he should agree or not
he does neither
miss costello youll see that dr
savers patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow
sayer watches kaufman leave
so does miss costello
lucy looking less like a woman than a diane arbus photograph of one doesnt
c sayer climbs into his toyota and as he buckles his seat belt recites in a mumble to himself one
he turns the key two
puts on sunglasses three
releases the brake four
shifts out of park five
just as hes depressing the accelerator someone raps on his window
he slams on the brakes
miss costellos face appears at the window
recovering sayer rolls it down
whatd i forget
i just wanted to say to you i preferred your explanation
its unclear whether he knows what shes referring to
and that ill look after things for you until youve settled in
good night doctor
he stares blankly out after her then at his dashboard
to it eventually quietly thank you
he glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car
to the reflection thank you very much
sayer at a table eating dinner alone
he shouldve brought along something to read
he glances at the little catch of the day notice on his table for the tenth time then absently in at an eel in a fish tank which seems to
be peering back out at him
i am not mad
a tether ball dangling from a rope resting against a pole
the chains of a swing
pigeons scavenging scraps on the asphalt of the elementary school playground deserted
i know the difference between what is real and what is not
beyond a chain link fence across the field on the roof of one of bainbridges brick buildings peering down from the edge of it coat over his smock hat on
his head an elderly man
tight on the elderly mans face
the voice was real
sayer nods in agreement though he is not altogether as certain of tne claim
they are in a ward crowded with many patients who are mad obviously and irretrievably so
what did the voice say
titch get your coat and hat go up to the roof and jump off
did you recognize it as belonging to a person
or was it just a voice
sidney considers sayer suspiciously
then smiles slyly
you dont deny it was you
sayer is taken aback
as is sidney
one of them and sidney believes he knows which is lying or crazy
i do deny it
it wasnt me
it wasnt real
pause weve only just now met sir
sidney suddenly completely disoriented withdraws
if thats true
im in a predicament
sayer in line with drs
tyler and sullivan both younger than himself
he seems distracted sayer lost in the color of the beets on his tray
or a thought
like george telling lenny again about the rabbits wed be high up th th floor nice midtown view suite of offices carpeted good looking receptionist rev
fp aquarium in the waiting room j george
we could have all that
but wed miss all this
wed miss the wards
the smell of them
wed miss this place this cafeteria wed miss this
the plate of mush as its set down onto his tray whatever this is
sayer glances up at them having paid attention to nothing theyve said and nods at some other thought
he leaves his tray where he stands and heads out of the cafeteria
v sayer back with sidney
did you see me when spoke
sidney thinks about it tries to remember to summon back the moment in question to picture it exactly as it happened or didnt happen
you see me now though
cont continuity only sidney turns to a patient an elderly woman in a wheelchair beside him
her state resembles that of lucys that is she appears to have no awareness of sidney sayer or anything else in her environment
it is only now in fact as sidney spoons soup into her mouth careful not to spill any that sayer notices her

he glances around
sees an orderly reading a newspaper
p borrows a section returns with it slides it under the pen and waits
the man doesnt write
sayer takes the pen back returns it to his coat pocket hesitates pulls it out again holds it out
and lets it go
the man lightning quick catches it
another man rigid as stone frank
this one peering up at a television set with a horizontal hold problem
sayer drags a chair over stands on it adjusts the set corrects it gets a picture
but the mans attention slowly drifts away
sayer read justs it gets the jumping horizontal lines again and the mans vacant eyes return
another dayroom crowded with patients one of which stands before a table absolutely motionless on thin bird like legs
it is lucy the one who caught the tennis ball
the movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness
sayer considers her from all angles as one considers an abstract art piece that baff les but in trigues
unlike the others shes on her feet
a nd unlike the others she seems to sayer to have been headed somewhere before turning to stone again
he decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room
and that its the table like a barrier that has arrested her progress
he moves the table
in what appears to be slow motion she takes a tiny step
and another before encountering and being blocked by an empty wheelchair
sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path
she continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again
sayer studies the puzzle
there are no longer any barriers in her way but shes not moving
defeated he goes to the fountain himself fills a paper cup and takes it to her
across the room a man in a wheelchair another ghost leonard stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive
o an admission form yellowed and brittle with age a typed date august
the admitting physicians name
the patients name
an identification number and ward assignment number
as sayer pulls the folder and closes the drawer of one of several filing cabinets lining the walls of a claustrophobic room miss costello slides open another locates a particular
folder in it and in the folder another admitting form the date may
names and numbers
sayer pulling another folder
another admission form date december
age of the patient
the files spread out on a table
sayer and miss costello leafing through them
sayer considers ones original admission forms
he scans bodies of text and finds a diagnosis atypical schizophrenia
he sets it aside and picks up another
atypical hysteria this one
sayer nods to himself and keeps reading his
he eventually finds in its text atypical rabies
he flips to the end of the file
no change since last examination it reads
he turns the page
no change no therapy recommended
he turns the page the last entry
there must be more recent files we missed somehow
part twos to their medical histories
miss costello is shaking head no
in some other filing cabinet somewhere
s sayer and miss costello walking to their cars
one would think that after a point enough atypical somethings would amount to a typical something
but a typical what
miss costello no doubt has less of an idea than sayer what the what could be
would you like to g e t a cup of coffee somewhere
normally id say yes
only ive made other plans
she nods quickly
she seems strangely relieved
some other time
they veer apart to their respective cars
the tiny gree i eyes in the head of the eel staring out at refracted light and shadow
sayer alone at the same table as before finished with his meal
p e s
lae the waiter leaves
sayer glances back into the fish tank at the eel behind the rock its rock its home
pin k p
fpl sayer strolling down a dark side street
he reaches a snail wooden house near the water and climbs three steps to the porch
he gets the front door opened and bends to pick up mail including a few book parcels from antiquarian shops just inside the threshold
tight on ernst heckle drawings of primitive life forms
sayer in his dining room leafs through the old first edition pleased it has arrived intrigued by its pictures
the parcel paper lies beside it on the table
fingers on the keys of a baby grand piano that seems out of scale with sayers small living room
wrapped in a robe he plays a melody
fcuj all around him lay packing boxes some empty many not
the books are out at least many of a medical nature many others on nature itself botany many first editions two and three deep on shelves on the floor on
tables stacked on the couch and chairs almost like figures of people
t a lamp on in the living room
sayer asleep on the couch an open book and reading glasses resting on his chest
his eyes blink open
not at a noise
at a thought
a n i g h t ja n i to r w i th a p a i l o n w h e e l s a n d

im sorry doctor
i thought someone left the lights on
glancing up from files strewn across the table sayer shares a discovery with the janitor they all survived encephalitis years before they came here
in the s
he taps a finger at the files the patients medical histories prior to admission forms listing childhood diseases and ailments
the janitor having no idea of course what he means retreats with his pail and mop closing the door
sayer displays what he has written on the back of his hand to an assistant librarian nejm
the new england journal of medicine april th
a microfilm machine
sayer manipulating its levers and eventually finding what hes after an article titled accompanying the text are grainy black and white photographs taken in an old operating theatre
an anatomical skeleton a doctor in a white coat subjects men women and children with haunting eyes
close on the doctor from the photographs ancient and ill
philosophically detached pus and pain thats the final reward
pus and pain and obscurity
hes in a small unkept rose garden
no te to g et c lear anc e fr om t he n ew en gla nd jo urn al of medicine we must indicate that it is a
weekly publication which is why the th has been added
i believe you when you say some still live
but i can assure you theyre medically irrelevant
as they were thirty years ago when i fought to get my work published
he smiles at a thought at once wistful and bitter
thats the problem with a unique disease
once it no longer rages im telling you it becomes very unfashionable
he buries his face into his mask manages to get some deep breaths into his lungs and shakes his head at sayer
what would i be without this thing
a man with a shred of dignity le ft
should i get your nurse
god forbid no
he lights a cigarette coughs and puts it out
how many have you found there
i think there may be more
the old doctor nods
he has the torn look of someone reminded of an unfaithful lover just when hed managed to forget about her
he wants and doesnt want to know how theyre doing
finally how are they
as you described them
as they were back then
as insubstantial as ghosts
only i guess most of them were children then
children who fell asleep
old doctors study day boxes of ancient history have been dragged out of storage the emphysema plagued doctors post encephalitic research files and photographs and cans of mm film
most died during the acute stage of the illness during a sleep so deep they couldnt be roused
a sleep that in most cases lasted several months
the doctors in the dark watch forty year old footage projected onto a screen by a pre world war ii bell howell a motionless man in a chair his head
thrust back mouth gaping open arms suspended out from an emaciated torso as if from invisible strings
those who survived who awoke seemed fine as though nothing had happened
years went by five ten fifteen before anyone suspected they were not well
they were not
a doctor this doctor decades younger appears beside the subject on the screen and lowers the mans arms
i began to see them in the early s old people brought in by their children young people brought in by their parents all of them complaining they werent themselves
theyd grown distant aloof anti social they daydreamed at the dinner table
i referred them to psychiatrists
the man on the screen disappears and is replaced by a seal shaped woman in whom a hundred strange diseases seem to reside
they conspire against her torment and harass her force her to perform incessant and meaningless actions with her hands to paw her chin to flutter to adjust glasses that arent
before long they were being referred back to me
they could no longer dress themselves or feed themselves
they could no longer speak in most cases
families went mad
people who were normal were now
searches for the word elsewhere
the woman on the screen is replaced by a young man a teenager who seems composed less of flesh than wax a wax figure with real eyes
what must it be like to be them
on the screen the young mans eyes entranced gaze upward as if trying hard to remember something
or trying hard to forget it
what are they thinking
the virus didnt spare the higher faculties
hopefully we know that for a fact
sayer waits for the old doctor to tell him the reasons the data to support the merciful truth
but he doesnt seem to possess it any more than sayer does
long silence before because the alternative is unthinkable
the hand of a stone like woman catches the tennis ball while the rest of her remains absolutely still
sayer gestures to anthony okay and the orderly wheels her out of the crowded room
the hand of an otherwise still life man snaps to catch the ball
sayer nods to an orderly who wheels him out past younger patients ward s residents
the ball glances off the face of a nan who turns in his wheelchair and glares at sayer
sayer has assembled them all the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post encephalitics and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone
he lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient
it remains suspended doll like
he tries to follow the trajectory of anothers gaze
it leads only to blank space
he considers another who appears deeply involved in some minute and curious activity with his twisted hands a kind of tearing shredding motion
v across the room paying no attention to sayer are sidney and lolly
hes gently brushing her hair
sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she draws a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until it reaches a vanishing
point in the center
the results of standard perception tests scotch taped to a wall of the examination room
sayer and miss costello like visitors to a museum consider each for a moment before moving onto the next
printed in the left column of each are a circle square triangle and daisy
in the right are the post encephalitics failed attempts to copy them
sayer keeps coming back to one in particular
unlike the others which if you use your imagination vaguely correspond somewhat positionally to the pre printed shapes this one bears no resemblance
this patient has instead scrawled over the shapes seemingly violently
miss costello joins sayer and ponders it along with him
eventually as if to excuse it and its maker its different
its quite bad
sayer keeps studying it
more to himself did he fail to understand
or was he unwilling to fail
he isnt really asking her to answer which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses
could he be saying i cant draw a triangle dont make me
before she can respond could it be willfully bad
she doesnt say it but its clear she thinks sayer is reading far too much into the badness of the patients scrawl
to himself which one is this
he leans closer to see the typed name
the painting of the western town from the prologue saloon livery stable sunset
below it in his wheelchair leonard
his face is unlined and passive like a mask
his body is still like the dead
sayers voice v does he ever speak to you
leonards mother a woman of seventy or so is combing her sons hair being careful to get the part straight
of course not
not in words
he speaks to you in other ways
how do you mean
lowe i you dont have children
if you did youd know
finished with his hair she wheels him from the sleeping ward and into the sayer trailing after mrs
lowe and her sonr becomes momentarily distracted by lucy the most recently arrived post encephalitic the one he tried unsuccessfully to coax to the drinking fountain
she is there again stuck at the same point angled toward the fountain but unable to reach it
sayer brings her a cup of water and rejoins mrs
id like to examine him again if thats all right with you
he did well
in a sense
hes very clever
arent you leonard
sayer shows her the perception test drawing leonard made
does this mean anything to you
more to leonard its very good
she glances back to sayer who nods uncertainly
the look on his face shes seen it before on the faces of more doctors than she cares to remember
becoming impatient with him well its abstract isnt it
sayer cant bring himself to agree with her
thats the problem with all you doctors you have no imagination
everything has to be real to you
no longer having any use for him she pointedly ignores him
taking the hint sayers wanders off past lucy looking like a statue holding the paper cup he brought her
the door opens from the inside revealing sayer in street clothes
judging from the look on mrs
lowes face he has arrived unannounced
i want to know more about him
an old photograph
a sixth grade class picture from
moving slowly across the young faces to leonard eleven at the end of a row
something was wrong they said with his hands
he couldnt write anymore he couldnt do the work i should take him out of school they said
he was eleven
theyre in leonards old bedroom sayer and mrs
except for the western painting thats missing nothing has changed in it in thirty years
a he slowly got worse
hed be talking suddenly hed come to a stop
after a few seconds hed finish what he was saying like nothing happened but these standstills got longer
sometimes hed call to me and id come in and find him at his desk in a trance
an hour two hours
then hed be okay again
sayer glances around the room
its been preserved like a shrine
one day i came hone from work and found him in his bed his arm like this reaching
pause what do you want leonard
she pictures the moment in her mind and waits it seems for the young leonard to speak to tell her what it is he wants
finally she lowers her arm and shrugs
he never spoke again
it was like hed disappeared
i took him to bainbridge later that year
he was twenty
sayer glances away from her to the room itself again
whatd he do with himself mrs
lowe those nine years he stayed in this room
she smiles to herself proudly it seems
y leonards face in shadow
wires emerging from his scalp
a sluggish eeg pattern
a blinding flash from a strobe
suddenly lights up the room
the pupils of leonards eyes shrink but his eeg remains stuporously slow
a monkey flipping switches on a panel built into a laboratory room searching for a sequence
in an observation booth years of collected data charts and graphs eegs and notes
mann a contemporary of sayers stares at sayer ay curiously
eventually he manages when you say youre working with people you dont mean living people
living people yes
mann just stares
hes a scientist they both are and the idea of sayer working with living people rather than expired ones laid out on the pathology table is inconceivable to him
fearing the answer where
its in the bronx
its a poor private chronic hospital called m ou nt appalled oh malcolm malcolm come back come on
youre a benchman youre no clinician why would you lower yourself
sayer hasnt an answer for him
hes great hes brilliant look at him
sayer glances away to hank the monkey watches him
mann studies sayer chagrined and incredulous
he slaps him angrily across the shoulders with some papers
the monkey completes a complex sequence which opens a chamber revealing an electric train
the animal jumps and hoots with wild glee
sayer reaches out and presses the button on the stop watch dangling from manns neck
subtract two seconds off his time
rats in cages wired up manipulating elaborate series of ladders and pulleys traversing catwalks or ratwalks leading to glucose rewards
while mann with something less than great enthusiasm considers an eeg sayer has brought his monkey drags toys over to sayer and tries to engage him in play
one of the toys is an ouija board
to sayer dont look at me like that
its for his alphabet lessons
to the monkey were busy hank go play solitaire
the monkey obediently goes off in search of a deck of cards
gesturing at patterns on the eeg asleep
first stage normal
second a little dull
normal he shrugs lays out a second eeg and gestures at patterns on it awake
no more so than a lot of people walking the streets of new york
shrugs again i give up whats wrong with him
you have them backwards
this is him awake
points to one eeg then the other this is him asleep
mann thinks sayer is kidding
this is him awake
this is him asleep
mann tries without success to make some sort of sense out of that
what are you saying
when hes awake what hes dreaming
when theres any brain activity at all which is infrequent yes
dreaming or hallucinating
and when hes asleep
when hes asleep he manages to create a kind of reality
what we might call reality
thats what you think these say
mann studies the waking eec he points to its one and only large electrical peak
whats this peak
this is the strobe
sayer indicates a flat section of the pattern where there is scribbled in pencil a small s
the large peak marked with an l is me saying his name to him
mann stares rather dumbly at sayer
then at hank the monkey on the floor dealing solitaire
tight on leonard
something blurs past him but his eyes dont follow it
pulling back the object blurs by again from the other direction
tight on sayer
the thing blurs past his face
his eyes dont follow it either
pulling back it blurs again
a circle of patients in wheelchairs
the post encephalitics reunited
waking just long enough to catch and release the object a small beach ball
leonard and sayer on opposite sides of the circle ignoring the ball and the other patients
hes reached a dead end sayer right where he began his only accomplishment this ball catching patients
sayer alone in the examination room tired at its window staring blankly out
his perspective the empty lot below littered with abandoned couches refrigerators rusting automobile carcasses
and beyond the lot the elementary school playground
laughing children on swings and slides
batting tether balls
moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games
on a girl tossing a bean bag into a square
jumping over it and into the next square
turning and jumping back
balancing on one foot
retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again
into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt
from above patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white checkerboard linoleum tile floor like chess pieces
the pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up is interrupted by an area of solid white where a wall once stood before being restored
it forms a kind of narrow sea the white area on either side of which lies land
at floor level sayer and miss costello on their hands and knees are blacking in the missing tiles with shoe polish bridging the gap between the two checkerboards
the retarded patients around them ignore them
the ward nurses pretend to
completing the pattern sayer glances across the room to leonard
he seems to be watching
his mother nearby idly thumbing through a magazine as she brings leonard up to date on neighborhood news isnt
sayer crosses to lucy
lifts her gently out of her chair
points her in the direction of the drinking fountain
she begins to move
to step slowly over each tile
she reaches the bridge and hesitates
then crosses it
sayer doesnt know whether to applaud or cry
he does neither burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead and watches as lucy delivered to the other side free now lets the regularity of the pattern guide her
toward the fountain
she nears it
she is almost there
then she is
but doesnt drink
she continues past it
to a window the window bevond the drinking fountain which sayer hadnt noticed before had no reason to notice had no need to notice with a broken pane allowing a
view to the outside
she stares out at the traffic below in hopes no doubt of figuring out where she is
and sayers eyes behind which exhilaration and horror rise up shift from her to miss costello and then to leonard in whose mask of a face sayer thinks he sees
a faint glimmer
these people are alive inside
a soap opera on a portable black and white tv in a narrow passageway of a nurses station
it beyond a glass partition a crowded idle dayroom
miss costello crosses into and out of view and reappears moments later next to the tv
she switches it off and turns to face the three rns who were watching it
in their defense the patients have all been given their morning medication
sayer was hoping youd have some free time
she hands a book to the nurse who spoke margaret a first edition worn rom many readings
margaret glances from it to the other nurses and back to miss costello
the nurse holds the book like its something quite foreign to her
she finds the beginning of the first chapter clears her throat and reads call me
ish ma el
she glances up at her audience three blank faced post encephalitics
miss costello who is nearby nods to her to continue
she clears her throat again and feeling like a fool reads some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse and nothing particular
to interest me on shore i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world
miss costello leaves
leonards head locked on his shoulders at an improbable angle that forces his entranced gaze upward to a point well above sayer
can you hear me leonard
i want to hear you speak your name
but leonard remains mute
tight on sayer pulling record albums from his extensive classical collection
old box style phonograph
the kind whose top is also a detachable speaker
an orderly fernando dusts it off rigs it takes the record miss costello holds out to him gets it spinning and sets the needle down
for the enjoyment of two more post encephalitics
the eyes of one narrow slightly almost imperceptibly
the keys of sayers old manual underwood typewriter
and leonards claw of a hand hanging over them like one of those unmanageable penny arcade cranes
leonards hand remains still suspended above the keys for what seems an eternity
under miss costellos supervision maintenance men remove the gratings from the windows and washhthe panes
s jazz music
the orderly from before with his two post encephalitics
each has a tray of cafeteria food but only one is eating and mechanically at that
fernando not just any music it has to be the right music for them
jazz does nothing for bert
pause its like theyre only moved by music that moves them
im that w ay
intrigued yes so am i
the moment fernando takes the record off rose stops eating stops moving
the orderly puts on mozart and waits
neither patient moves
i havent found anything that moves bert yet

thats not true
i wish i had something like that
ssmething that would interest you instead of this stupid boring ms
leonard in his wheelchair absolutely motionless
sayer behind the lens of the mm camera on the tripod
tyler and sullivan at the doorway watch with some amusement
miss costello wheels the man who shreds invisible things to a window and places a piece of toast from a tray into his hands
he tears at it the crumbs sailing out onto a landing and a flock of pigeons swoops up
three post encephalitics with cards in their hands and the best poker faces you ever saw
theyll sit there all day like that if i let them
i have to play the first card
sayer watches her pull a card from one of their hands and place it on the table
all three wake and begin throwing down cards one after another
is it a real game i wonder
if it is i dont know it
maybe its three different games
sayer moving past normal patients lined up in the hall like planes on tarmac
suddenly from a dayroom booms the opening bass line of hendrixs foxy lady

in a far corner of the darkened ward in a pool of lamp light two silhouetted figures
sayer and leonard
sleeping patients all around them
sayer carefully awkwardly places his hand on leonards
after a moment the contact brings the useless appendage to life
as it slowly turns over and grasps the doctors hand a glimmer of life seems to appear in leonards eyes as well
sayer unfamiliar it seems with the feeling the contact produces in him nonetheless places his other hand on leonards other
soon it too turns and holds onto sayers
the doctor draws both of leonards hands toward him and sets them down on the pointer of an ouija board
ill begin moving the pointer toward the l
once i feel you beginning to move it ill stop and youll take
do you understand
leonard of course cannot say whether he does or not
the look on his face is thoughtful
the look on sayers hopeful and foolish
the pointer begins to slowly move past stars and moons
judging from sayers expression he begins to feel leonards movement of it and presumably stops his own
the pointer moves across the letters but passes the l without stopping
it stops on the r
no i didnt make myself clear
the pointer begins moving again interrupting sayer
it passes the l again reaches the i and stops
but the pointer is moving again
it stops on the l
thats what i meant
now the e
it begins moving again
but not to the e
to the nk where it hesitates briefly before moving again
realizing to himself youre spelling something el e
keeping one hand on the moving pointer sayer fumbles a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on his lab coat what leonard has and is continuing to write sayer
alone in the examining room standing over his desk
the lab coat is on it
and on it is scrawled he has to study it only a moment before he sees the meaning of it he quickly scratches out the last four letters and adds
a slash between the s and the p so that it reads r i l k e s p a n t h e r bmbjup a card catalogue
cards flipping by stopping on one that reads r rilke rainer maria german poet and fiction fwriter collected poems tr
german by moving slowly in on sayer at one of the library tables with a v
continuity onxy his gaze from staring through the bars has grown so weary that it can take in nothing more
moving slowly into the western painting
for him it is as though there were a thousand bars and behind the thousand bars no world
moving in on a panther limbs weakened spirit broken slowly pacing back and forth before the bars of a small cage
as he paces in cramped circles over and over his powerful strides are like a ritual dance around a center where a great will stands paralyzed
moving slowly away from sayer watching moving high above him the place is virtually deserted
moving slowly in on leonard as in bed flannel pajamas as his mother diapers him for the night
at times the curtains of the eye lift without a sound
moving slowly sayer v
and a shape enters
slips thr ough the tightened silence of the shoulders reaches the heart and dies
a continuity only professional and professorial types filing in past a placard an enlargement of an article from the journal of neurochemistry titled levadopa in the treatment of parkinsonism
below it theres excitement and jealousy in the air
an anatomical skeleton dangling from a metal stand
theres an ordinary medicine with which we are all familiar
an everyday medicine of stubbed toes and bunions and boils
a man at a podium in a modern version of the s basement operating theatre
and then there is another kind
a medicine that holds out to the afflicted the promise of restored life
he glances to a point above his listeners and an overhead projector splashes a diagram of molecular structure and the silhouette of a raised hand onto a screen
the neurochemist traces the shadow to its maker in the audience
yes im very much interested in your work with this drug
im curious if
im curious if you
after im through dr
if you wouldnt mind
sayer glances around the auditorium
everyones looking at him
he grasps the offending hand and holds it in his lap with the other
refreshments on tables
sayer uncomfortable in his suit wandering around the crowded room with a glass of wine
he approaches its hub of activity the neurochemist surrounded by several impressed colleagues but cant manage to get close enough to speak with him
the neurochemist walks in and crosses to the urinals
a moment later he hears the door opening and footsteps and then nothing until do you think its possible that simple parkinsonian tremor taken to its furthest extreme could appear
as no tremor at all
when no one answers the chemist glances over his shoulder
sayer is there quite alone looking at him
are you speaking to me
and really wants to know the answer
the chemist zips up and moves to the sinks to wash his hands
if jail the compulsions in the parkinsons patient were somehow accelerated demonstrating what he means the hands the shaking the tics the head bobbing the quickening speech hes become a
mass of tics and accelerated speech might they not cave in on themselves and in effect turn the person into stone
he comes to a abrupt stop his eyes transfixed like a post encephalitics staring
the chemist slowly dries his hands with a paper towel
sayer nods im a chemist doctor
i leave it to you guys to do the damage
he drops the paper towel into the trash and leaves emerging from his car with some papers dr
kaufman is ambushed by sayer
did you have a chance to look at any of the
freud believed in miracles
prescribing cocaine like it was candy
sayer has to hurry to keep up with his supervisor as he heads toward the hospital
we all believed in the miracle of cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it
now its l dopa
he hands over the papers xeroxed articles from medical journals and newspapers which sayer gave him to read and keeps going sayer straggling a few steps back
with all due respect i think its rather too soon to say that
with all due respect its rather way too soon
let the chemists do the damage
the gap between them widens as sayer slows
he expected this sort of reaction from kaufman but had hoped for another
kaufman disappears into the building
the stack of papers drops onto kaufmans desk
the one on top reads new drug lets shaking palsy patients eat jell o
did you read the case the husband who came home to find his wife singing
she hadnt felt like singing in years
kaufman on the phone glances to sayer long sufferingly lets him wait while he finishes with his call and eventually sets down the receiver
i read them all
all thirty cases had mild parkinsons
your parkies if thats what they are havent moved for decades
you know better than to make a leap like that you want to believe theres a connection that doesnt mean there is one
what i believe what i know is that these people are alive inside
how do you know
because they catch tennis balls
i know it
sayer doesnt elaborate but his tone is resolute
and it has the intended effect on kaufman causing him to consider the possibility that sayer could somehow know it as a fact
and what if this drug were to kill them
right back and what if this drug were to cure them
somewhere behind kaufmans eyes sayer can see he thinks a change or reminiscence long ago long buried of things he once believed or wanted to believe
how many did you think i d let you put on it
all of them
some of them
one of them
with the familys consent
sayer tries to hide his elation and turns to leave before kaufman changes his mind
sayer sayer turns
he was almost to the door
he had almost made it out
that immense project of yours
when that failed what was the reaction of your lab supervisor
sayer thinks about lying but senses kaufman knows the answer already and just wants to hear him say it
so he does he asked me to leave
kaufman nods like just checking
and good luck
a standard consent form and pen on a kitchenette table
two coffee cups
one used tea bag
people with ordinary parkinsons disease sometimes complain that theyve lost their grace
he picks up a cup with a shaking hand they have to think about the things we just do
with great trouble he sets it down it has to do with a chemical in the midbrain or rather the lack of it called dopamine
l dopa replenishes this dopamine making it possible for these patients to move more naturally
he picks up the cup again gracefully and sets it down
leonard has parkinsons disease
no his symptoms
are like parkinsons
and then again theyre not
she doesnt understand what he means theres no reason why she should
pause then what will this medicine dp
i dont know what itll do for him if anything
what do you think it will do
i dont know
what db rev
i hope itll bring him back from wherever he is
to the world
pause whats here for him after all these years
you are here
she ponders that and the enormity of the whole situation all the while staring at the consent form
the hospital pharmacy a subterranean structure built into the basement cluttered from floor to ceiling with medicines
ray the pharmacist dips into a bag of powder
he spoons some out onto a scale and looks to sayer to tell him the dosage
i have no idea
what do you say we ease into it with
ray begins to measure five milligrams
lets say a hundred
ray shrugs its okay with him
he knifes at the powder removing all but milligrams
leonard sphinx like in his wheelchair his mother by his side
sayer stirring the l dopa into a paper cup of orange juice
miss costello in the doorway watching
sayer hands the glass to mrs
v note consult w sacks on this may need the contents of a capsule emptied into the cup rsv
your mothers going to give you some juice
theres medicine in it which is why it may taste more bitter than usual
sayer glances to mrs
its as if theyve rehearsed it all
she holds the glass to her sons lips and gradually drains the liquid down his throat
nothing immediately happens of course but they all with the exception of leonard look as if they expect it to
lowe hands the empty glass back to sayer
and they all wait
ray measuring out another milligram dose
maybe the acid in the orange juice neutralized it
or maybe its not enough
ray tosses sayer a look that says dont push it
sayer n od s
ill try it in milk
an empty milk glass on a night table
leonard in his wheelchair in pajamas still and silent under the painting of the boat
his mother sayer and miss costello watch and wait while around them nurses atid orderlies hoist other patients into bed
ray scrapes powder from the scale into a pharmaceutical funnel which takes it down onto a miniature glass dish
handing the dis h to say er five hundred milligrams
another empty milk glass
leonard stoic or so it seems in his wheelchair
his mother and sayer and miss costello waiting for a movement a change of expression a sign of any kind that something is happening inside him
but theres nothing
lowe is leaving
sayer is with her seeing her to the door
ill call if theres any change
neither really knows what else to say except for good night
sayer and miss costello lift leonard out of his wheelchair and into his bed
im going home too
if you need me
yes ill call
they nod good night att each other and miss costello leaves
sayer slumps into leonards wheelchair
ray has gonejhome too
sayer alone in the pharmacy measures out milligrams ten times the original dose
sayer at leonards bedside holding the glass to leonards lips draining the liquid into him all of it
sayer asleep in the wheelchair
and takes a moment to remind himself where he is
his eyes narrow uncomprehending
leonards bed is empty
a claw of a hand dragging a crayon across a sheet of paper
tight on sayer framed in a doorway as still and silent and entranced as a post encephalitic
his perspective of the dayroom deserted except for a figure a patient leonard hunched over the table
as sayer crosses toward him leonards head slowly rises
sayer sits opposite him and they consider each other in silence for several moments
leonard struggles to speak to form words
they come out in a halting cadence flat without inflection and are only barely
recognizable as words
everyones asleep im not asleep
though he nods its unclear whether leonard realizes how significant that is
sayer gestures at the piece of paper beneath leonards hands
sayer draws the paper across the table
its covered with what seems imponderable hieroglyphic like scrawl
but there is order in the chaos
alone in the room leonard moves slowly around it feeling things the smoothness of the cabinet glass the warmth thrown by a desk lamp water from the cooler splashing onto
leonard turns to sayers voice with an expression of child like wonder on his face
your mother is here
she appears in the doorway of the room
shes done her hair her face shes put on a nice dress yet she remains unprepared for this reunion
she can do nothing but stare at her infant son who is now suddenly a man
as he slowly crosses toward her she is struck by the fact she must look u in order to meet his eyes
he reaches her
reaches out to her
and she embraces him
a corridor crowded with patients in wheelchairs with nowhere to go and nothing much to do
my name is elizabeth
its a pleasure to meet you
leonard standing reaches for her hand and struggles to pronounce her name correctly
fighting to keep from crying in front of him miss costello glances to sayer and mrs
miss costello flanked by sayer and mrs
lowe watches as leonard extends his hand to the card playing nurse
how do you do sir
my name is margaret
another corridor morning margaret has joined the tour group and introduces leonard to the music orderly
they shake hands
how are you
fernando is along for the ride and watches leonard shaking ray the pharmacists hand
how do you do mr
the cooks and kitchen workers around leonard and his entourage shaking his hand
a tray of truly awful cafeteria food
the group minus sayer and miss costello watches leonard dip a fork into some mush like concoction and manipulate it with difficulty to and into his mouth
he seems amazed by its flavor
i wouldnt go that far len
sayer and miss costello at another table glance over to the others who are all laughing
i dont think i could deal with losing d years of my life
i cant even imagine it
sayers smile fades
the possibility that leonard might not have realized the extent of the passage of time had not until this moment occurred to him
he stares blankly at miss costello
he does realize it doesnt he
sayer nods uncertainly
sayer demonstrates a clapping motion
leonard repeats it more slowly but with decent motor control
sayer makes a note
they are alone in the examination room which like most of the hospital has little in it to indicate that it is not the s
can i see you walk the length of the room
leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and polaroids cluttering the wall
coming back he pauses
hes looking at a picture of himself taped there
sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features
he stares at the photograph of himself trying to comprehend that which cannot be comprehended
hes not younjg anymore
sayer and mrs
lowe at leonards bedside
i m af r ai d to cl os e m y ey e s
if y i close my eyes
he hesitates as if saying it may make the fear more real
and when you wake up in the morning it will be the next morning
sayers smile tries to assure them both that it will happen just that way
he excuses himself leaving leonard with his mother joins miss costello by the door and glances back
lowe is stroking leonards head as she hums a lullaby
sayer comes in with some books sets them on miss costellos desk and crosses to a closet
i didnt sleep did you
does it look like it
sayer hangs up his jacket and slips into a lab coat
do you know if leonards awake
she smiles and points toward the adjoining examination room
showered and shaved and groomed and bright eyed leonard sits listening to his own heartbeat with sayers stethoscope
coming in i sayer good morning
his speech is still rather flat halting
been waiting for me long
he hands leonard the books
some things have happened while youve been away
i thought youd be interested
leonard opens one carefully reverently and begins reading from it to himself
you dont have to read them now leonard
at your leisure
leonard closes the book but holds onto it and the others like theyre gold
i used to read quite a lot
sayer i yes i know
thank you for these
sayer nods that hes welcome
have you thought about what youd like to do today
smiles im not sure i can arrange that
sayer smiles again
for a man who just yesterday learned he has been cheated out of the greater part of his life leonard seems to have recovered extraordinarily
lets approach it this way
x do you think youd like to do
a continuity only id like to go outside
sayer and leonard emerge from the hospital and move under trees along a path toward the parking lot
at a point the doctor realizes his patient is no longer at his side hes several steps back feeling the sunshine on his skin
p though it is only a toyota its dashboard to leonard resembles something out of jules verne
he allows sayer to buckle his seatbelt for him and watches with fascination as sayer performs the complex preparatory sequence necessary apparently to make the car go
the car pulls away
above framed in a second story window of one of the buildings stands a lone figure looking out leonards mother
tight on the radio
sayer switches it on
to leonards amazement classical music fills the interior and continues over billboards advertising color televisions and electric shavers
buses which have grown over the decades to a behemoth scale
ultra modern housing projects and gas stations
leonard cannot imagine a more enthralling re introduction to the world and stares at it all with wonder
everywhere he looks there is something extraordinary
what a wonderful place the bronx has become
the music continues over a rose
leonard puts his face close to it to appreciate its fragrance
he touches its petals gently explores them and is quietly astonished by the tactile sensation
he too can appreciate wonders of the real world especially those of a botanical nature but not with the purity or intensity leonard can
pulling back reveals them in the middle of a vast garden of countless thousands of roses
leonard turns the radio dial from the classical station to another playing a very different kind of music and listens to it bemused but intrigued
its john lennon singing a day in and it continues over children playing flag football on an expanse of grass
dogs running around nannies with prams lovers
a disk a frisbee falls at leonards feet
he retrieves it but has no idea what it is or what to do with it
sayer demonstrates the wrist action with an invisible one
leonard doesnt get it
sayer takes it from him and flings it pathetically not halfway back to its owners
the music continues over leonard watches with interest a carvel ice cream machine
he and sayer are handed cones and leonards attention moves to a girl wearing an unbelievably short skirt
her boyfriend stares at leonard
sayer tries to pull his charges attention elsewhere
leonard finally glances away up to a sound overhead
the music continues over a roaring down a runway
at the edge of it it lifts off and thunders over sayer and leonard and the parked toyota
exhilerated leonard waves
the music continues over an expressway
the toyota traveling at astounding speed passing a sign that reads city island
boats and fish markets and lush vegetation
paradise compared to the bronx
the toyota turns down a side road near the water t and into the driveway of sayers small wooden house
and the mus ic ends
tea bags steeping in a pot on a cluttered kitchen counter
sayer exhausted from the day hunts in vain through packing boxes on the floor for crackers cookies something he can offer his guest
he keeps glancing in at leonard whos wandering around the dining room navigating around packing boxes to browse at the spines of books
noticing sayer watching you just moved here
well five years ago
sayer shrugs disappears into the kitchen a moment
before peeking back in to see what leonard is looking at now a small i framed photograph of a boy with a toy sailboat and a forlorn expression posed in
front of a curtain the boat obviously a photography studio prop
t looking closely at the photograph you seem uncomfortable
i probably was
sayer disappears into the kitchen again
and a moment later glances back in around the door frame at leonard who has moved over to an old sideboard on which several pairs of glasses are neatly arranged
each has a specific purpose
as leonard considers each pair of glasses
those are my normal interior glasses
and spare pair
those i wear outside
two pairs in case i los
those those are my daytime reading glasses
those are for close work
for fine print
those are my nighttime reading glasses leonards examining the frames of this last pair closely
thats heavy gauge metal so when i fall asleep and roll over on them i dont wreck them
leonard returns the indestructible ones to their proper place and considers them all together
as long as i pretty much know ahead of time what ill be looking at it works out i dont have to carry all five pairs around
what if you just want to go for a walk
pause walks are a problem
walks are the hardest thing
you just never know
hes absolutely serious like a man plagued for years by an imponderable dilemma
he retreats back into his kitchen before reappearing again with the pot of tea two mismatched cups and some saltine on a tray
i hope youll forgive the inelegant presentation
i dont entertain much
theyve cleared places on the sofa and chair and sit there q sipping their tea
i can date my interest in science precisely actually
id been sent off to boarding school a place perhaps not quite as dickensian as i remember it when i happened to come across the periodic table of elements
smiles at the thought i memorized it
which i admit was a rather precocious thing for a seven year old to do
and i remember feeling
not so much a sense of accomplishment
the halogens were what they were
the alkali metals were what they were
each element had its place and nothing could change that
they were secure no matter what
leonard nods perhaps more out of politeness than understanding
sayer nods too feeling perhaps a little exposed
youre not married
it seems to sayer a non sequitor
sips his tea
silence except for the ticking of a clock somewhere
then very matter of factly im not terribly good with people
i like them
i wish i could say i had more than a rudimentary understanding of them
pause maybe if they were less unpredictable
eleanor would disagree with you
sayer stares at him blankly
he doesnt seem to know who eleanor is
r leonard miss costello
oh yes of course
uneasy shes spoken to you about me
sayer cant imagine why nor what she might have said
fearing the worst whatd she say
that youre a kind man
that you care very much for people
sayer shifts in his chair uncomfortably
but you meant normal people
sayer seems at a loss as to how to respond
the accompanying til silence grows awkward
we should be getting back
sayer crosses over to the sideboard to the pairs of glasses stares at them for several moments and picks up two pairs
climbing out of his car kaufman sees sayer striding toward him
he glances to the sky kaufman to god and silently complains to him
cafeteria workers carting serving trays back to the kitchen
nurses and orderlies and office workers at tables with finished meals and cups of coffee
they seem unaware of drs
sayer and kaufman at a table near the door
z when you say expensive what are we talking about
to put them all on the dosage mr
lowe is on
about twenty thousand dollars
kaufman stares at sayer aghast
he knew l dopa was expensive but not that expensive
he manages to recover somewhat
that would be for how long
about a month
kaufman glances away
stares blankly at faces at other tables
back to sayer
i cant go before the board with that
he laughs to himself at the futility of it
i was thinking of speaking to the patrons
the few patrons this hospital has give what they can
well wed have to convince them to give more than they re accustomed to giving
he hadnt intended as impudent a tone as that which came out
more calmly perhaps if they saw mr
i think you overestimate the effect mr
lowe has on people
were talking about money here
kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware of the silence around them
no one is talking
he glances up as miss costello walks by setting something on the table in front of him
she leaves the cafeteria without a word
cd kaufman glances down
she has left a bainbridge payroll check cz made out in her name
kaufman turns it over
she has endorsed it back to bainbridge hospital
fernando walks by and out leaving his salary check on the table
then ray the pharmacist leaving his
then the nurse who reluctantly read moby dick to the patients
then a cafeteria worker
the cafeteria is soon empty except for sayer and kaufman
mm film of leonard before l dopa a wide shot of him absolutely motionless in his wheelchair
there was extreme rigidity of the axial musculature
only vague available motion in the neck
no voluntary movement in the limbs
a tight shot of leonards entranced face appears on the screen
perhaps most striking was the profound facial masking which we now know should not have been confused with apathy
tight on sayer the light from the projector flickering on his face
virtually aphonic mr
lowe could articulate no words but rather only with considerable effort an occasional noise a kind of h
in the darkness sit kaufman the rest of the board of directors some elderly patrons of the hospital and near sayer miss costello
she hands him a scribbled note
less scientific it reads
isolated circumstances the mention of his name notes of particular pieces of music the touch of another human being managed on occasion to briefly summon him but these awakenings were
rare and transient lasting only a moment or two
sayer glances to miss costello
she nods good thats better
the rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place deprived of all sense of history and happening and self encysted cocooned enveloped in this metaphorical if not
physiological equivalent of sleep or death
tight on the screen on leonard as he was
looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one
this was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital
and the quality of his life for the last years
the before picture of leonard on the screen is replaced with the after his eyes alert his hands exploring a desk microphone
he glances up and off at something
whenever youre ready
my name is leonard lowe
it has been explained to me that i have been away for
quite some time
he seems to withdraw to wrestle with the thought to try to somehow come to terms with it to somehow resolve it
he nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera
the lights are on the screen rolled up the board members and patrons visibly moved almost shaken and silent
eventually one of the patrons an old woman reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen
another patron an elderly man pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket
another already has hers out in front of her
sayer and miss costello exchange a glance
the room is absolutely silent except for the muted scratch of pens on paper
the raw l dopa powder dollars worth has arrived
it sits on a pharmacy counter in large clear bags
sayer and ray peer between racks of medicine at two teenage girls and two very old men chatting in a corner of the pharmacy
theyre volunteers from the neighborhood
several empty medicine paper cups
the garden of stone reassembled
sayer knows better than to sit and wait that nothing is going to immediately happen but he sits and waits anyway
as does miss costello
as does leonard and his mother
sayer asleep on a couch thats too short for him
miss costello asleep on another
sayer wakes to find a night nurse standing over him
what is it
ry continuity only its a miracle
they move along a silent corridor that seems to stretch out forever the doctor the two nurses carrying themselves professionally with sobriety and restraint
but as they near the ward as theyre joined by others other nurses orderlies their steps and hearts quicken
they break into a trot
they appear at the threshold sayer miss costello the night nurse the others and peer into the darkened room in the quiet in the shadows in the moonlight filtering in
through the windows the post encephalitics are emerging from their cocoons rising from the dead like lazarus from the earth reborn
moving slowly past the beds a figure rediscovering the feeling of her skin another the sound of his breath another the beating of her heart
a figure still asleep
and for the first time in nearly half a century sees herself in the world
tight on sayer on the look of awe on his face as he stares at the scene going on in the darkened ward
his glance finds leonard who is sitting up in his bed smiling
tight on lucys face deep in thought lost in thought
after several moments of silence she speaks i just had the strapgest dream
a cacophony of off screen voices from a radio the television and the awakened post encephalitics themselves rises up as another woman miriam moves past lucys face
we follow her as does a nurse with a blood pressure guage on wheels
b aa tireen pg miriam please i have to check your blood pressure interrupting ive been sitting for years you missed your chance
miriam and the nurse trailing after her pass in front of a man with no english josef trying to explain something to a couple of orderlies
one to the other
youre italian hes italian whats the problem
i was born here x dont speak italian
nearby another man
this one does speak english i want a steak rare
i want mashed potatoes and gravy string beans a slice of pie and a chocolate phosphate
anthony turns away with the tray he just brought in broth jello and juice and carries it away passing the card playing nurse margaret
i think i prefer them the other way
having settled on margaret she smiles glances to her patient rose who staring at her reflection in a hand mirror tugs at her grey hair
and some dye
jotting down the request black are you sure
and some clothes

well find them for you
well track them down
lucy again sayer still at her side
i called to my sister but she couldnt hear me
no one could hear me
i was alone
pause and then i woke up
sayer tries to
but finally cant help asking her lucy what year is it
what year is it
you dont know
he shakes his head no
she glances around the place then leans close to him and whispers
sayer turns to the urgent voice concerned and sees miriam flanked by a large group of staff from other parts of the hospital gathered at the threshold of the room
i walked all the way over there
what a perfect day
the group at the doorway applauds and it carries over the corridor and the sound of a womans voice very faint
from somewhere unseen
like crowds storming the bastille
sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the faces of the awakened post encephalitics and staff
he spots sayer seated with a woman her back to him and the door
she slowly turns to look over her shoulder and seeing sidney smiles
theres a kind of hush
conversations activities cease
everyone is looking at sidney
not knowing what else to say he manages a hesitant hi
i he smiles and crosses toward her but by the time he reaches her the smile has disappeared
something troubling has occurred to him
he glances to sayer and whispers is it real
as real as real can be
leonard moving along the corridor with savers camera and tripod or looking for something to read at the magazine table slows and listens the mighty mets stormed their locker room
shortly after nine oclock on their night to remember he moves toward the voice traces it to a crafts area where a young woman is reading from the sports page to an older man tied to his wheelchair
though its doubtful the man is even aware of her presence she reads to him as if her were and in the process draws leonard into the sound of her
words until there are no sounds but her words released from bondage and ridicule after seven destitute seasons they raised the roof of shea stadium while their fans attempted to dismantle it in one of the loudest wildest victory celebrations in baseball history
the reverie is suddenly shattered the real sounds of the hospital rising back up as sidney wild with excitement bangs through the far doors of the corridor
he sprints past the crafts area past leonard runs the entire length of the corridor and sidney bursts into the room out of breath and scans the faces of the
awakened post encephalitics and staff
he spots sayer seated with a woman her back to him and the door
she slowly turns to look over her shoulder and seeing sidney smiles
theres a kind of hush
conversations activities cease
everyone is looking at sidney
not knowing what else to say he manages a hesitant hi
x x x u o i v a u i i u e mu u j r g he smiles and crosses toward her but by the time he reaches
her the smile has disappeared
something troubling has occurred to him
he looks to sayer and whispers is it real
as real as real can be
sidney lowers himself to his knees before lolly and weeping quietly rests his head on her lap
she strokes his head
sidney and lolly emerge from the dayroom followed by the other post encephalitics
theyre all wearing suits and dresses and walk with purpose past wheelchair bound patients with uninteresting diseases
as they wait for the elevator leonard wanders slightly down the corridor to see if the girl is there again reading in the crafts area
the chair she was in is empty
the elevator door slides open revealing them
paula inside hesitates the sight is almost surreal
as they crowd in she wedges out and down the hall leonard watching after her
len come on
leonard steps into the elevator the last one in
theyre going on a field trip
as theyre escorted onto an idling hospital bus leonard outside it tries to reason with his mother sidneys going
hes a patient mom
c j hes not the same kind of patient
xx xu o y v au j ju k nk u d p hes still a patient
youre not a patient
im your mother
inside the bus miriam anxious to leave leans over the driver to honk the horn
leonard kisses his mother on the cheek and turns away
wait a minute
he turns back what on earth have you done to your hair
hes parted it apparently on the wrong side
she pulls a comb from her purse recombs it correctly straightens his jacket lapels and steps back
theres your bus
the public bus behind her coming down the street
as she hurries to the corner sayer climbs down off the hospital bus
ive decided not to go
he waves to his mother
sayer stares at him
im staying here
he waves again to his mother shes boarding the public bus
sayer does as hes told waves too
impatient miriam honks the horn again
j lets go already
as the public bus pulls away leonard pats sayer on the shoulder
ill see you later have a good time
he climbs the hospital steps and disappears inside sayer staring after him
miriam honks the horn again and he climbs aboard
the doors hiss shut and driver turns to him
sayer suddenly realizes he has no idea where to
he glances over his shoulder at the expectant faces of the patients all dressed up with nowhere to go
its up to him
his face brightens hes thought of a good place
moving slowly toward a herd of still and silent elephants in a cavernous darkened room
as a nun counts the heads of parochial school children filing past the huge beasts miss costello counts the heads of the post encephalitics
both come up short and glance frantically around
nun v calling william
a lifeless polar bear in a diorama stares out at sayer whos peering in intrigued
miss costello appears at his side
its very hard to keep everyone together doctor
has someone wandered off
she leads him away by the arm
a dayroom thick with inactivity
and the voice from the sleek skyscrapers of wall street where a tickertape blizzard filled the sky
from the doorway from a distance leonard watches paula across the room with her father reading to him again from the newspaper
to the undistinguished bars of a hundred neighborhoods new york yesterday went pleasantly mad over the world champion mets
paula moving along the serving line with a tray
leonard next in line moving along with his tray a little too close
he steals a glance
you following me
startled and embarrassed leonard withdraws
i saw you upstairs
leonard nods without looking at her
you work here
i live here
pause youre a patient
he admits it with a nod lags back again and eventually dares another glance at her
you dont look like a patient
pause i dont
she smiles and shakes her head no
leonard and paula at a table
at other tables are patients who do look like patients
i dont know if he knows i visit him or not
i dont know that he knows who i am
my mother doesnt think so
she doesnt come around any more pause but you do
sometimes i think i see something
i think i see a change
and for a second i see him like he was
she smiles at the memory of her father like he was
but then its gone and her smile fades
does that make any sense
a slow nod from him
his tone is that of someone speaking of a fact rather than offering an opinion
she studies him
and eventually why are you here
goldenrod pg he doesnt know how to begin to explain it to her
pause i receive medication
she waits for more but it doesnt come
only a smile
im okay now
the post encephalitics filing past still figures in african ceremonial costumes and masks
a working display of a tide pool
anthonys reflection joins sayers in the glass
ive always loved tide pools havent you
anthony doesnt answer
he seems troubled
what is it
you chose this place
sayer nods why
pause i come here all the time
sayer glances away sees miss costello coming
she looks a little irritated
as she arrives ti sayer miss costello i think anthony thinks theyre bored
he says it like have you ever heard anything so ridiculous
sayer taken aback glances back to anthony whose look says there you go
i d thought about the opera house
do you think theyd prefer that
the opera house
the botanical gardens
anthony looks to miss costello and rolls his eyes
well where else is there
roselands big band belting out that old black magic
on the dancefloor the post encephalitics dance with one another amidst normal middle aged and older couples all having a great time
at the bar sayer tries to get the attention of a young bartender busy mixing drinks
watching it slowly dawns on rose that something is wrong here
more to herself its legal again
pause for some time now
rose is delighted she can hardly believe it
she gets the bartenders attention
a rob roy on the rocks
the young bartender has to think a moment
rose turns back to watch the action on the dance floor
gesturing to rose miss costello whispers to the bartender a shirley temple
leonard and paula crossing toward the front doors
shes just chatting but hes taking it seriously
things happen people are late
they wont be angry
oh theyll be angry
whatre they going to do fire me
he doesnt realize shes not asking him
he has to shrug that he doesnt know
u t ill just take the graveyard
her look to him says right
he has no idea what she means but finally nods in agreement
theyre almost to the doors
she offers her hand to him
he shakes the hand gently lets it go
thanks for talking to me
she steps away toward the door
she glances back at him
shes not sure what he means
he knows you visit him
whether hes saying it just to be nice doesnt matter to her
its what she wants to believe
she smiles gratefully
ill see you
the band in the middle of you hade me love you
at the bar is he betrothed do you know
miss costello doesnt know who she could possibly mean
she follows her sightline to the opposite wall to a chair to sayer sitting alone
not that i know of
i kind of doubt it
rose gets up and crosses toward sayer
seeing her coming he smiles
but the smile slowly begins to fade as she sings to him you made me love you i didnt want to do it i didnt want to do it
singing as she does it she pulls him out of his chair
embarrassed he resists but she finally gets on the dance floor
never more mortified in his life it seems as if everyone is watching he dances
and the band finishes the song
continuity only returning from their night out happy and satisfied the post encephalitics come down a quiet corridor trailed by their chaperons
passing the examination room sayer hears faint typing and slows
sayer steps into the room to find a figure hunched over his typewriter in a pool of lamplight
glancing over to the door the figure is revealed to be leonard
everybody have a good time
leonard doesnt wait for the answer returns to his typing
sayer comes closer
what are you doing
he peers over leonards shoulder to read what hes typing and a slow smile crosses his face
one typewriters and writing supplies in all dayrooms at all times
drifting slowly across the faces of kaufman the director and the other board members as sayer reads to them from a typewritten sheet of paper
two music and dance classes for those patients who desire them
three technical courses for those who wish to learn a trade
four patients grievance committees
five the same food in the patients cafeteria as in the staffs
six and i happen to think this is an excellent idea the establishment of a permanent hospital library
and seven televisions that work
sayer sets the paper down on the table respectfully leonard lowe
and listens to the silence
its a long one
the boiler room
exposed conduit and pipes and ducts on the ceiling like tangled roots of an enormous metal tree
cherry pg a subterranean corridor
deserted except for sayer and leonard a dusty anatomical skeleton shrouded in fdarkness is suddenly illuminated as sayer yanks down a sheet covering a high window
yanking down another a second shaft of light falls on old discarded surgical tables and equipment
brain surgeries were once routinely performed here back in a time when they held out hope for docile patients and dociled the rest
used only for storage now its floor and tiers of observation benches
are covered with boxes and files and broken furniture
leonard stares in at the eerie room and listens to the distant muted drone of the furnaces
he feels as though hes been here
maybe he has long ago
quietly what is this place
its your library
sayer pulls down another sheet and more light spills in
itll take some fixing up obviously
a thorough cleaning to begin with
books of course
leonards glance slowly moves across the dim room settling finally on sayer whos smiling
they agreed to find the money for it
and to my suggestion that you oversee it and select the books
fingers on the keys of a piano sayers baby grand moved here from his house
rolando oblivious to the world at it playing a simple yet emotional melody
continuity only hes still hasnt talked
we think he got sick before he learned how to talk
listening to the music a moment more she corrects herself to talk with words
close on two nurses across the room
shes the daughter of the nephew of a dutch archduke
shes referring to magda who glances over as if sensing theyre talking about her
they drop their voices hes dead this duke
hes been dead a hundred years
then forget it im not curtsying
lucy wearing stylish new glasses smiles as sayer listens to her heartbeat through a stethoscope
satisfied with it he makes a notation in her chart
can i have your hand
yes you can have my hand
she holds it out to him take me away from this place
he smiles uneasily
im your doctor lucy
youre my prince charming
close on hands rapidly dealing card monte
the cards eventually settle and the hand of someone else hesitates over them before gingerly tapping one
as its turned over there it is
the orderly snaps his finger in triumph
the card monte dealer a dextrous encephalitic shrugs
another tough break for me
the orderly reaches to rake another dollar into his pile
theres a nice watch on the wrist
luis smiles to himself
i dont know how to say this miriam so i m just going to say it
miriam waits but margaret doesnt immediately say it
miriam nods he was granted a divorce from you in
margaret almost grimaces anticipating hysteria
instead a slow smile crosses miriams face
pliers tin snips and a pile of found objects on a table
josef is there fashioning strange and beautiful toys from the junk
francis turns to find the nurse standing with a year old girl whos holding a toddler by the hand
francis smiles at the toddler mistaking her for the daughter
francis glance comes up to meet the year olds shifts down to the toddler again comes back up
from across the room frank watches francis hug her actual daughter glances to rose who has been reunited with a few old girlfriends to desmond with his son and daughter
in law and their teenage kids and to sidney and lolly in a corner
a hows it going frank
frank glances blankly at anthony and another orderly who are hanging out nearby with bert passing around a road track magazine
hows it going
how do you feel
how do i feel
pause my parents are dead
my wife is i in an institution
my son has disappeared
out west somewhere
pause i feel old and i feel swindled thats how i feel
anthony glances at the others with a why did i ask kind of look
frank wanders away
he is old
so is bert though he doesnt feel it
as far as hes concerned hes still twenty years old
he glances back at the magazine
pontiac firebird engine now theres a car bert
he likes the sound of it
tight on the picture in the magazine
rough sketches and balsa wood models of the operating theatre proposed library on a table
leonard working on them
leonard glances up from his work
his mother glances up from her magazine
one of them is delighted to see the girl
the anatomical skeleton being dragged across the flpor like the lifeless thing that it is
excuse me maam
paula steps aside as the guy goes past her and leonard with the rattling bones
take some of these benches out
maybe have a ramp over here
hes not exactly sure where everything is going to go but hes proud of it
gesturing to the operating lamp hovering from above like a giant spider im going to get rid of this thing
the thing is so unbelievably macabre they have to grimace
another mover comes past dollying out old operating equipment
excuse me maam
lowe slowly pacing
he never talked about girls before
he certainly never had anything to d with them
she casts around trying to come to terms with it
its a bit ridiculous all this girl business dont you think
a grown man like him
she looks to sayer for confirmation
sayer manages a nod
you know what he said
i should take a vacation
i should go away for a few days and relax
continuity only maybe you should
she shoots him a look im sure he meant you deserve a vacation
which you do
i cant leave him alone in this place
hed die without me
sayer agrees with a sympathetic nod but suspects it is she who would die if she left
she resumes pacing and mutters to herself the bitter tasting word girls
sayer in bed asleep with a book on his chest and his indestructible reading glasses on his face
the phone rings
he groans and gropes for it puts the receiver to his ear
i think we should organize a speaking tour
sayer more asleep than awake cant be sure that what hes hearing who hes hearing is real
leonard wide awake alone in the room
hes seated at sayers desk with sayers office phone to his ear
i think its important
i think its important some things were said
what kind of things
things that matter
things that have happened to me
things ive cone to understand
sayer is gradually coining to
he glances at his clock
its like three oclock in the morning
where are you calling from
sayer i its very late leonard
sayer nods to himself that it is
that fact and that leonard has apparently felt compelled to call him to discuss things concerns him
im coming over
sayer listens to it a moment before slowly setting the receiver back on its cradle
dressed haphazardly hair messed up eyes still a little unfocussed sayer resembles more a patient than doctor
clean and alert leonard appears rather more doctor like
read a newspaper people have forgotten what life is all about
theyve forgotten what it is to be alive
they need to be reminded
they need to be reminded what they have what they can lose what i feel this the the the
his mind seems to be racing ahead of his mouths ability to the joy the freedom the spaciousness of life the gift of life
this is what theyve forgotten
this is what they need to remember
this is what well tell them
leonard waits for a reaction to his idea his gospel according to l dopa lecture tour
sayer can manage only an uncertain nod
amidst the thousands of bottles and jars of medicines sayer wonders out loud to ray i dont know if its liberation or mania or love
i never know
what he says is absolutely true
we dont really live
pause does that mean theres something wrong with him or us
the balance of the pharmaceutical scale wavers like the sword of damocles
a night janitor with a cleaning cart peers into the darkened room at leonard standing at a window looking out
leonard glances over are you all right
the janitor wheels his cart back down the corridor
leonard stares back out the window at what lies beyond the grounds of the hospital
the glittering lights of the manhattan skyline
drifting slowly across the faces of the board members again and across sayer i m thankful to everyone in this room
i was dead and you brought me back
and reaching leonard standing at the head of the table
i m thankful but what i need now isnt here
and eventually since no one else asks it where is it
kaufman and sayer and the others follow leonards gesture to the windows
lowe i m sorry i m afraid i dont understand
what is it you want now
the simplest thing
somehow doubting it will be simple and what is that
i want to know that im free to go for a walk if i feel like it
like any normal person
the board members glance among themselves
they seem relieved
v that is a simple request
kaufmans shrug says of course alone
now theres a pause
and leonards hand makes a gesture to his face to his brow
he ignores it or is unaware of it
what difference does that make
pause i think you know
i dont know
right back it makes all the difference
he brushes at his brow again
sayer studies him or rather the tic itself as it repeats
you didnt wake a thing you woke a person
i m a person
are you at all aware of the unconscious hostility youre exhibiting towards us right now
kaufman glances over to the psychiatrist weary
the look on leonards face is complete innocence and his tone completely without innuendo how could i be aware of something thats unconscious
sayer smiles to himself
so does kaufman
the psychiatrist doesnt
i m curious
i can tell this is important to you but i m not sure why
what would you do if you went out
a i dont know what would you do if you were me
his patience straining i m hot you
i d walk around
i d talk to people i d look at things
i d decide whether i wanted to go this way or that way or keep going straight
i d do the things you do everyday and take for granted
then ill tell you what well take it under consideration
well let you know
leonard at a table
yeah i was aware of it
the tic i was nervous
whatd they say
they said its a dangerous place out there
they said they cant be held responsible for what might happen to you out there
they said no
leonard nods sips his coffee seems to take the decision in stride
and what did you say
they dont have to listen to me
did you agree with them
leonard nods again philosophically it seems
i m not sure were out of the woods yet leonard
im not sure this is nothing
the tic i have to be sure youre well
therell be time enough leonard gets up out of his chair bye
and turns to leave
leonard ignores him and walks out leonard striding down a corridor
sayer hurrying after him
where are you going
for a walk
leonard ignores him
leonard disappears around a corner
sayer veers off to a hospital phone and picks it up
into it this is dr
faces of patients in wheelchairs blur as leonard runs past them
in another corridor faces blur as orderlies rush past them
in another corridor faces blur as sayer runs
leonard reaches the lobby just ahead of the orderlies
they try to be gentle with him but when he fights to free himself it it gets out of control
let go of him
the orderlies dont know what to do
theyre just trying to restrain leonard but hes making it almost impossible
leonard stop fighting
he keeps fighting
he can see the outside through the glass doors so close so far
let ao of him
they pull him back away from the doors into the corridor w behind them
tight on sayer staring at the floor despondent
i dont understand it he was never any trouble before
kaufman too is there and miss costello
kaufman watches sayer
he was quiet and polite and respectful
he never demanded anything
he was never disobedient
he was catatonic mrs
he seems to say it more for kaufmans benefit regardless she doesnt care for his tone
im speaking of when he was a boy
ft of course
to kaufman he was always nice minded when he was a boy
kaufman nods studies sayer
i dont know who that is up there
i dont think he knows
to sayer youve turned leonard into something he is not
coming up a flight of stairs s music can be heard
reaching a caged landing the orderly escorting sayer unlocks door leads him along a short corridor to another door and unlocks that one
an old black and white musical blaring from a television bolted to the ceiling
young male patients subdued with thorazine vacantly staring at it
sayer comes in finds leonard in one of the chairs and kneels to gain some confidentiality
leonard cranes slightly to see around him to see the television
this is a mistake
its wrong and its cruel and it should never have happened like this but you have to understand nothing quite like this has happened before no one knows what to
leonard please dont ignore me
leonard condescends a look to him
a moment and sayer smiles at a thought i wish you could just walk out like that
i wish it were that simple
cherry pg is
sayers smile fades
leonard glances back to the set
tight on the screen fred astaire and ginger rodgers dancing
light glows in only a few of the windows
in one on the third floor the examination room a figure in
silhouette sayer stares out
in another on the fifth floor a second figure in silhouette leonard behind bars slowly paces
the blaring tv again
suddenly the picture goes dark
leonard who turned it off climbs down off a chair and faces the somnambulant men who were watching
moving along their chairs he considers each much as sayer considered the post encephalitic garden of stone
reaching one stretched out across three chairs asleep leonard gently nudges him
the elevator door slides open revealing an orderly with several trays of untouched food on a cart
kaufman steps in and the door slides shut
descending i guess theyre not hungry
kaufman nods distractedly not really listening
the orderly begins whistling a tune to himself
kaufman glances over long sufferingly quieting him
the door slides open and the young man wheels the cart past kaufman
the door slides shut
cherry pg leonard paces before the entire ward population gathered like the blind and the sick under a revivalists tent
it isnt us thats defective its them
were not in crisis they are
weve been through the worst that can happen to a person and survived it
they fear it
and they hide from their fear by hiding us because they know they know
the men wa it for the rest but l eonard loses his tra in of t ho ugh t
f ru str at ed h is t ics r es urf ac e and ela bor at e
h e seems unaware of them
to one of the men
how long have you been here
the man shrugs you dont know
a month a year
sj he doesnt know whv are you here
he doesnt know that either
to another patient how do you feel being locked up
i dont like it
you dont like it
arent you an animal
im no animal
then why are you in a cage
the mans getting agitated
they all are
leonard stops pacing faces them and almost whispers anger
and suddenly loudly exploding thats what you feel
the men erupt in a burst of noisy approval they cone alive
tight on kaufman on the other side of the cage watching
and over the din hes lived for thirty years in abjection and defeat
sayer and kaufman alone in the room arguing hes lived for thirty years without the ability to release his anger so have the others i happen to think his behaviors
more natural than theirs kaufman t really and his tics and paranoia
theyre more natural hes in that place
oh is that it we wake him up then lock him up thats not paranoia thats a fact
ive got psychotics up there doctor refusing to eat
they have no idea whv theyre refusing to eat
how long should i let that go on he knows why hs
hell so do i
kaufman suddenly looks weary as if all his years in this place have finally at this moment caught up with him
eventually calmly evenly mr
lowe is not the messiah of ward hes a man in trouble
he wasnt resurrected he was administered a drug by
you thats fallen somewhat short of its miraculous reputation the others are fine they show no signs of hes been oq it longer
sayer has no rejoinder
a silence before i sympathize with him
ive tried to accommodate him
i will not let him endanger the health of other patients
hes resolute it feels like a threat or ultimatum
trying t remain calm sayer changes tacks ill talk to him ill explain t he problem
hell listen to m e kaufman has to laugh without the drug hes dead
th e sta teme nt do esn t hav e qui te the p owe r saye r may h av hoped
at least not on kaufman
his eyes seem to go dead
and then the slightest slightest shrug
sayer enters the dayroom and is immediately intercepted by three young male patients
the patients stand their ground forming a kind of human barrier which sayer cannot get past
we cant allow it
leonard across the room pacing slowly glances over
hes all right
leonards bodyguards step aside
sayer crosses to leonard and is greeted in a tone precisely that of master to servant very courteous yet unmistalcably condescending how are you today
im all right how are you
a strange gesture a tic appears and repeats
and these gentlemen
these gentlemen protect me
i wish i didnt need them
someone wants to hurt you
no answer who
leonard glances at sayer with a slight knowing smile
thats the thing isnt it you never know who
someone i least expect i expect
look at history
every patient in this ward thinks theres a plot against him leonard
yeah well theyre mistaken theyre crazy
the smile that appears this time on leonards face is as insane as anything sayers ever seen
then somethings wrong
the drugs not working
these are side effects and theyre consuming you and if we dont do hey i appreciate you coming to see me i have some things to do
leonard abruptly extends his hand its a little twisted
sayer doesnt so much shake the hand as hold onto it
look at yourself leonard
leonard tries to pull his hand away but sayers grasp is stronger
look at yourself rev
erupting look at vou
leonard yanks his hand free of sayers and in a torrent disease took mjs out of the world i fought to come back i failed for years but at least
i fought look at you
but sayer is looking at him moving back and forth against the bars on a window panther like
he retaliates the medicine can be taken away
that can be done
can wake up in the morning and it wont be there
the remarks seem to have no effect on leonard
he seems not to have heard them
but as sayer takes a step closer leonard without warning lunges
sayer stumbles back and his glasses fall to the floor
scrambles to his feet leaving them and backs away from leonards bodyguards who are slowly coming toward
orderlies get the cage unlocked and hustle sayer out
as it slams shut again he glances back in at leonard and hardly recognizes him
beyond the porch windows sayer can be seen slowly pacing the narrow width of his living room
opera music blares and continues over
moving slowly past the sleeping forms of ward inhabitants
and reaching and settling on a bed thats empty
the opera music continues over the record spinning
and sayer at his desk just sitting his close work glasses resting on a page of ernst heckle
t the opera music continues over test pattern on the television
leonard in a chair blankly staring
his eyes are drawn to something glimmering on the floor across the room
savers shattered glasses
the opera music continues over alone in his room perched on his bed sayer pathetically cleans his remaining pairs of glasses
the opera music continues over the shards of the lenses layed out on a table
leonard picks one up and turning it over to consider it sees that it has already cut his finger
he doesnt set it down
a metallic dang interrupts the music and echoes into silence
sayer appears and slowly climbs up through the caged stairwell
he reaches a landing and unlocks a door
sayer steps into room and quietly crosses it
he peers in at sleeping figures and at the one empty bed
how are the others
sayer turns to the voice to leonard a ticcing figure in shadow hunched in a corner of the dayroom
continuity only pause they should be
pause they want you back
i want you back
leonard remains in the shadows
eventually i want to be back
i sayer has called together the ward staff the other patients kaufman and ray
hes aware of his appearance
hes less concerned with it than he is with the effect it may have on the rest of us
he waits for the patients to acknowledge they understand
well be working with his dosage
hes aware of this too and says hes prepared for it
he wants us
to be prepared for it
the patients glance away to the threshold of the room
miss costello and mrs
lowe are escorting leonard slowly in
anthony comes over shakes his hand
the others come over shake his hand and pat him on the back but all a little too gently too concerned like he might break
leonard manages a smile
i m all right
the others nod quickly in agreement
and the room falls into silence
only its too quiet in here
co anthony at the piano playing singing the others echoing the refrains you build me up buttercup only to let me down
v its like a cocktail party everybody dressed up some singing some milling around talking
leonard tries to enjoy it too struggling to contain to hide from the others the tics that are trying to come out
i keep acquiring new ones like a junk collector
through the lens of the mm camera the blackboard
chalked on it leonard lowe mgs
in front of it leonard seated in a chair his hands performing repertoires of tics
he seems wholly unbothered by them
some are new
some are elaborations
some are counter tics
they dont bother me
what bothers me is that i know they shouldnt be there
one of his hands makes a movement to his ear to his pants to his ear again like some bizarre genuflection
this is new
alone in the bathroom leonard struggles to get toothpaste onto a toothbrush with two tremoring disobedient hands
its a monumental struggle
the counterweight of a pharmaceutical scale being slid by hand from to mgs
b lue pg
the other patients at tables painting
leonard at another table with the sketches of his library
on one showing the placement of tables and desks he writes the letters f l o w before getting stuck
flat theres no sense of time
its like being caught between mirrors or echoes
tight on his face his eyes transfixed
something has to happen
a cockroach runs across the paper and leonards eyes wake up and his hand finishes the word f l o w e r s sayer and leonard watching film of
him eating from a bowl of soup
the hand with the spoon freezes midway to his mouth
its not that it feels bad its nothing i feel nothing
like im nothing
like i m dead
the counterweight sliding up from to mgs
though the junk has been cleared and some of the railings ripped out the place is still grim unpainted
wood scraps and workmens tools lay around
theres a wheelchair ramp half built not yet in place
i feel good when i m working
i feel good in here
in this room
theyre alone in it he and sayer by a table saw thats cluttered with the original hospital blueprints and leonards plans and notes
l the book list is coming along
i d love to see it
its here somewhere
as he hunts for it amidst all the notes his hands and head begin shaking
the hands seize on some other papers and hard as he tries he cant make himself let go of them
the pages crumple
its all right ill see it some other i hes interrupted as leonard suddenly goes into an severe oculogyric crisis his head thrusting back get the camera get the camera
get the camera get the camera
s p ig mm film of leonard in a chair in the middle of the room where thirty years earlier patients had been filmed
his head still back his eyes darting his mouth spitting out words i cant do this im turning the camera off no no no no watch watch watch watch i
have to help you learn learn learn learn learn learn learn rev
l dopa powder falling like snow onto the scale and the counter weight balancing precariously at mgs
the chalkboard name and dosage mgs
and leonard signing on it clearly without trouble leonard lowe
he seems fine
suddenly his hand jerks up and catches the tennis ball sayer has thrown
the ball without warning comes back
sayer lunges at it but misses
it hits his wrist and rolls across the floor
well i wasnt ready was i
theyre both so relieved they can hardly believe it
it seems theyre out of the woods that theyve found the middle ground
tight on leonards pharmaceutical chart on the desk
sayers hand comes in and boldly underlines the dosage mgs
leonard buttons his shirt then picks up the bow tie he always wears when hes seeing paula
he looks well he feels good the only sign of illness some fine motor skill trouble
here let me
no i can do it
she watches him try to get the tie on by himself and casts around feeling perhaps without a purpose
eventually more to herself than to him what you see in that girl
she trails off i dont get it
d to himself shes normal
no answer youre not talking to yourself again
you shouldnt do that you know
she watches him struggle with the tie a moment more
finally she cant bear it any longer and reaches to do it for him
youre taking forever its hard to watch
i can get it
no you cant
i can get away from me
he pushes her hand away and turns his back to her
she cant believe it
then to herself in a murmur thirty years
the tie comes off in leonards hand which begins shaking uncontrollably
jump cut to the trembling has escalated into a full blown crisis
the staff and other patients cant ignore this one
sayer wedges past them and into the room and crosses quickly to leonard and his mother both hysterical
all trying to speak at once what happened
i said a terrible thing
she she she she
hi s a rm lash es out s end ing the mo del of the li bra ry cra shin g to the floor
lowe what happened
she devoted her life to me
shed have a life if it werent p for me
i said the most terrible thing
i m ungrateful

theres a song at twilight when the lights are low pg
h er voice c ontinues t he verse o ver rose her sad stra nge china doll face
youd never know it now but i used to be so pretty dr
sayer even you wouldve thought so
i do think so
she shakes her head no
she knows what she looks like
what if hes just had enough of it
sayer glances to magda nearby with a group of other patients some of them looking off toward the sunroom where leonard alone at a window stares out
what if its just a matter of time for all of us
theres no reason to think any of this will happen to you
and youre all well
pause arent you
most nod but its without great conviction
hes the strongest of us
close on lucy across the room with miss costello finishing the song comes loves old song comes loves old sweet song
her voice trails into silence
that was lovely
i learned that song a long long y time ago

pause i know its not
i just need it to be
drifting across leonards dosage schedules minute milligram changes leading to vanishing point of health across the scale with nothing on it and reaching finally sayer alone in the room surrounded
by racks of medicine and no solution
they he glances up
lowe has appeared in the doorway consider each other for a long moment before when my son was born healthy i never asked why
why was i sp lucky what did i do to deserve this perfect child this perfect life
her face toughens
but when he got sick you can bet i asked why
i demanded to know why
why was this happening
then with an almost philosophical shrug there was nothing i could do about it
there was no one i could go to and say stop this please stop this cant you see my son is in pain
hes fighting mrs hes losing
sayer almost recoils as if from a slap
then the truth is
i wouldnt mind if he lost
long pause i know you cant understand how i could say such a thing
but we were happy before
leonard alone at a table with a book
he glances up as sayer sits opposite him then down again at the book
i cant read anymore
the words are written too slow
i keep going back to the beginning to the beginning and trying
he turns back to the beginning tries again his eyes moving too quickly across the lines ahead of the words
his hands and head begin shaking out of control and it s all he can do to close the book
ive let the others down
you have not
ive let you down
you have not
leonard i wont sit here and listen to you talk about yourself like this look at me
he is a man consumed by illness
with a voice that is flat and f w limbs that are bent and hands that are twisted and a grimace that can only hint at the great depth of
the despair he is suffering
look at me and tell me i am not
you are not
its over and leonard knows it
and though he wont admit it so does sayer
leonard barely gets the words out this
standing before a mirror above a sink leonard struggles to part his hair straight
hes wearing his best clothes those he wears when hes seeing paula but they seem to drape awkwardly
he may not have looked like a patient when paula first met him but he does now
its all she can do to not break down in front of him
i had friends p over
i went dancing
thats about it
leonard ticcing nods smiles through his grimace imagining those things
i know i should do something with my life
those are great things
ive never done any of those things
leonard shakes his nead no
theyll never let me out of this place
they consider each other for several moments the one young and healthy the other old and ill
im not well
i feel well inside when i see you
i wish you could see whats inside
instead of this
i can see it
as much as leonard wants to say i love you he knows he cannot that it would be ludicrous
he ho lds out o ne of his sh aking han ds to her
s he reach es to it places her hand on it holds it and the shaking slowly slowly slowly begins to subside
she lifts him gently out of his wheelchair and leads him away from the table
she arranges his arms in such a way that he is sort of holding her and begins to slowly dance with him
some patients glance up from their food
ser vers glance up co f rom their work
all watc h wi th a sort o f re verie the coup le dancing without music
they watch as leo n ard s tics gradually disappear
they watc h as he finds a sens e of grace and ease as he borrows her gra ce and ease
they w a tch him become simply a man dancing with a woman
from somewhere perhaps imagined there is music a quiet melody played on a piano
rolandos hands on the keys of the piano playing the melody
note hay want to shoot front end of this scene again without rol ando to l eave op en the opt ion of usi ng the sam e s core

l eonar d r eturn ing f rom t he ca fete ria walks slow ly in to t he room
hes bent his arms at strange angles like the limbs of a diseased tree his legs managing each step only with great concentration
he nears the center of the room the area of inconsistent tiles which sayer and miss costello long ago conformed with shoe polish
some of the black has worn off and as leonard reaches i t h e f in ds hi ms elf t hro wn b y t he ir re
gu lar it y
he t rie s to step over to the other side but his feet or legs or mind will not do it
everyone in the room except rolando becomes acutely aware of the problem of the struggle of leonard fighting with all his will and nothing but it to cross over

she glances back briefly before disappearing around a corner
rolandos musdc continues over the original mm film of leonard his eyes alert his hands exploring the microphone
f sayer s voice film
whenever youfre ready
t my name is leonard lowe
it has been explained to me that i have been away for quite some time
tight on sayer alone in the darkened room watching the footage watching leonard wrestling with the thought
light moves across the screen
someone has entered
she exchanges a long glance with sayer before they both look back to the screen
i thought it was a dream at first
silence except for the sound of the projector
then when did you realize it wasnt
leonard thinks back trying to recall the exact moment he realized he was alive
n finally when i spoke and you understood me
one tear snakes down savers cheek
the film cuts to silent footage of leonard soon after his awakening combing his hair and delighting in the fact that he cjan comb it
quietly without looking at miss costello you told him i was a kind man
long pause its kind to give life only to take it away
there is self loathing in his voice
on the screen leonards trying to operate an electric shaver that seems alive
its given and taken away from all of us
on screen leonard buttons buttons on his shirt and glances up smiling proud
tight on sayer in the dark room the projector light flickering behind him
more to himself why doesnt that comfort me
quietly because you are kind
pause and because hes your friend
on screen leonard is beckoning to someone unseen
no one appears but he keeps beckoning
finally sayer embarrassed and camera shy appears
though there is no sound it is clear he asks what
leonard turns the doctor so that he is facing the camera and points
sayer again asks what
there leonard says
finally sayer looks directly curiously into the camera
rolandos music continues over through a window autumn leaves on trees
and the school yard beyond the field quiet deserted
pulling back panes of glass
across the walls of the dayroom
drawings and water colors of people and places
to the arm of the metronome slapping back and forth
and a twisted hand a pen grasped awkwardly in it writing excruciatingly slowly and just barely legibly c o r i a x th e ha nd an d th

t its winter
his voice is flat inflectionless
his eyes with little life behind them staring at the falling snow
hes in a wheelchair
am i speaking
leonards eyes drift to a chair his mothers chair the one she has used for thirty years
your mother is well
she visits you on sundays
leonard slowly nods
somehow he knows that
f shes living her own life
shes trying to
leonards eyes drift again across to silent ghost like figures in wheelchairs the post encephalitics all of them asleep again
they fought as you did with great courage
they were strong
leonard looks down at his hands and feels one with the other
he looks back at the sleeping patients not comprehending why they cannot do the same
sayer is finally revealed seated beside him
he doesnt answer
leonards hands slowly reach to his face and feel its features
x im here arent i
his glance finds the tray beside sayer the paper medicine cup and empty juice cup on it
he must be back on the medication again
he looks back to sayer whos looking toward the window to the falling snow
eventually do you think you can walk
a doctor in a lab coat one sayer long ago imparted his will of the ball theory to emerges from a ward
the doctor turns
fernando is walking toward him
you got a minute
not really what is it
fernando arrives leans against the corridor wall and sort of mumbles you know that woman in ward
whats her last name grace
annoyed does it matter fernando
sayer and leonard walk slowly past behind tyler
fernandos eyes briefly meet sayers
i guess not
another doctor emerges from another ward
sayer and leonard approach
margaret has positioned herself like anthony against the wall and pointing out something on a clipboard to dr
sullivan glances up briefly as sayer and i j leonard pass
sayer and leonard approaching the lobby
as they enter the switchboard operator glances up notices them and glances back down without a word
they approach the front doors
they are almost there
from behind them loudly dr
sayer and leonard stop just short of the doors
they glance back and see kaufman and v several steps
him looking distraught miss costello
she has failed
the two doctors stare at one another for several moments
clearly kaufman knows what is happening
clearly sayer knows he knows
eventually put a coat on him for christs sake
he turns around walks past miss costello and down the corridor from which he came
miss costello relaxes turns around and walks away down the corridor
sayer and leonard turn and walk outside
though rolando is not playing cannot play the piano he can hear it distant like an echo as a nurse wheels him toward the windows
other nurses and orderlies are wheeling rose frank bert and lucy and the others there
sidney is wheeling lolly
they all peer out
they all see down below standing across the street sayer and leonard
co sayer drapes his coat around leonard
neither quite knows what to say
eventually sayer holds out a hand for leonard to shake
leonard stares at it for a long moment then awkwardly embraces sayer
the others watch sayer cross back to the hospital
they watch leonard staring after him
he glances down the street leonard glances down the street the other way
he seems uncertain which way to go
he walks away
metal wheels over metal tracks
leonard feels things
inside his coat pockets
he pulls from one several capsules of l dopa in a clear plastic bag and from the other a wad of money wrapped in paper on which is typed his
name and bainbridge hospital bronx
he stuffs it all back into his pocket and glances up
the train is crowded
everyone seems to be hiding behind a newspaper or the veil of a glazed look everyone but leonard and the eleven year old boy seated next to him with his
theyre taking everything in leonard and the boy the rumbl of the train the overhead lights flashing off and on again the mounting excitement they both feel
the boy glances up at leonard and like a secret a whisper were going to the city
a whisper back
people climbing stairs
leonard climbing with them
under exposed pipes and ducts
through an exit turnstile
up more stairs
and finally rev
continuity only leonard emerging from down below reaches the street
people jostle past him but he doesnt move
he stares in wonder at what lies before him
lights skyscrapers christmas decorations taxis noise people
an oppressive silence
the oppressive institutional room
sayer alone in it at his desk in the corner
sayer glances up sees miss costello in the doorway to the corridor
a folder in
drawer straightens things on the desk
looks for something more to do
clearly theres nothing more to do
he gets up
wanders slowly around the room
past the medical instruments in the glass cases the tripod and projector along tne waii covered with taped and tacked data notes polaroids
buried in it he sees leonards original perception test and alongside it the first polaroid of him
sayer abruptly moves to the window yanks at it but its jammed shut again
below he can see miss costello crossing toward her car
he fights with the window finally frees it slides it open and yells out loudly eleanor
she turns to the voice
he turns from the window
tight on the glasses left on his desk
he hurries out of the building and across the lot
winded he reaches her
gre en pg

maybe we could just
go for a walk
thats the best he can do
a slow slow smile crosses her face
i d be delighted
a mechanical dog crosses leonards path wagging its tail
unlike everyone else he stops to admire it
hes enchanted by it
he smiles at the peddler and the litter of pups moving around his feet
theyre so life like
and only five bucks can you believe it
in the back of a taxi leonard stares out the window mesmerized by all he sees
the driver glances back in the rear view mirror
how bout those jets
leonard glances at the rear view mirror and finds in it the drivers eyes
i like them
leonard glances out the window a little puzzled to the sky to see if theres one flying overhead
the driver glances back to see what leonard thinks of that
leonard nods uncertainly
as they rattle along leonard peers back but the window at things going by and absently pets the mechanical dog in his lap
eventually youre not from here
i was born here
ive been away a long time
hector has to laugh but its cut short by the blare of his horn as he slams it in response to another cab sliding into his lane
the meter clicks over and into double digits
the taxi is parked across the street from a diner
i dont mind sitting here if you dont but to what end are we sitting here
leonard watches a waitress in the diner paula chatting with some young customers
his hand moves to and onto the car door handle but then hesitates opening it
paula is getting her coat and leaving with her friends
they have ice skates
prometheus stealing fire from heaven dwarfed by the christmas tree that towers over him
figures glide past the statue
skaters on the ice rink
at least as seen through
from the promenade he watches the skaters gliding gracefully over the ice
hector appears at his side
i m sorry to bother you len i just thought you should know this is adding up you know
without taking his eyes from the skaters below leonard digs into his coat pocket and hands hector a clump of money hundreds of dollars
embarrassed i didnt mean that just i dont need it you keep it
hector puts the money back in leonards coat
leonard finds paula among the skaters isolates her from them and watches her glide around the rink
a fine mist of snow is falling veiling her
beautiful isnt it
a blur of faces of people on the promenade from paulas j perspective
though it is impossible she thinks for a moment wj she sees leonards among them
she arcs and glances back up again but the man who resembled leonard is gone
the cab rattling down another street
you have children hector
hector takes a photograph from his chauffeurs permit plate and hands it back
a boy five healthy and happy
i thank god for him every day
every single day
leonard begins to weep softly
once hector notices he slows the car pulls to the curb and studies leonard in the rear view mirror
has this man lost a child
the taxi engine idles
r the cab empty parked in front of an apartment building in a working class neighborhood
the mechanical dog on a bathroom sink
leonard staring at his reflection in a mirror
and at his hands
hes falling apart
leonard at a bedroom door
peering in at hectors sleeping son
he steps quietly into the room and places the mechanical dog on the pillow beside the boys head
the living room
a small christmas tree
hector and his wife sitting on cheap furniture with cups of egg nog
leonard emerges from the hallway
i have to be leaving
having trouble with the words i want to th ank you
youve been very kind to me
hector and his wife are both thinking the same thing this mans not well and they shouldnt let him go
youre our guest we got dinner coming
were having something to eat
his wife agrees with a couple of words in spanish as she gets up and crosses toward the kitchen
stay with us
and he cant explain why
he takes the crumpled wad of money and paper from his coat pocket and tries to give it to hector again
hey it has no value to me believe me
i dont want it
its for your son
its for him
hector doesnt take it but doesnt say anything more about it when leonard sets it down on the coffee table
at least let me give you a lift wherever youre going
no i think i d like to walk
to hectors wife thank you
she nods your welcome from the doorway of the kitchen
leonard offers his hand to hector to shake
whats wrong with you len
pause this is good what youve got here
i know that
leonard smiles the man does know it and appreciates it
descending from a fire escape strung with a single strand of christmas lights
down to the street below to leonard moving along the sidewalk noticing a young couple bundled up hurrying down the stairs of a basement apartment fumbling with keys a christmas
tree too large for the doorway of an another apartment across the street being tugged at by someone inside unseen
his gait and tics and especially the smile make him look insane
he passes a shop window with very simple ornamentation as the proprietor inside switches out the lights and continues on and into the darkness of the street ahead
the drone of engines and syncopated rhythms of wheels of unseen cars
leonard at the rivers edge stares into the water
his hand comes out of his pocket holding the bag of l dopa capsules and he lets it fall in
it floats for a moment before a force from below like a hand pulls it under
leonard on a bench
behind him across an empty field bums huddled over a barrel fire warming their hands
sayers face appears against a pastel dawn sky
leonard glances up at him
behind them in the distance hector stands outside his parked cab
continuity only i m sorry
he smiles crookedly then looks out across the water again
isnt that something
sayer looks out
the morning colors are mirroring off the water like paint on glass
they both watch
the colors are deepening right before their eyes
long long silence before
can you take me home
sayer helps him up
and as they move slowly toward the waiting taxi
hector opens the rear door
the only sound is the hiss of tires the rhythm of wheels
until when i was a boy i felt myself being carried away by illness like a swimmer sucked out by the tide
drifting slowly out across the water and the brooklyn bridge stretching out across it
i feel it again only this time ive been somewhere
i vent to a place and felt things i never dreamed of
i went to a place and felt hope and fear and hatred and love i glimpsed life
drifting slowly across the faces of patients reading in leonards library and settling finally tight on him asleep
its good life
spines of books on shelves lining the walls
and paulas face considering the titles
lj i t doesnt matter wh ich one
theyr e all his favorites
continuity only she pulls one of the books down at random and crosses the library with sayer passing patients including the woman with multiple sclerosis readiny at tables with flowers
hes in a wheelchair behind an oak desk on which rests among other things the ouija board
his eyes open but do not appear to comprehend the doctors presence or his surroundings
his expression is absolutely expressionless
i m sorry to wake you but theres someone here to see you
leonard remains still
and theres a long silence broken only by the sound of pages being turned
and then from dickens the old curiosity shop reading night is generally my time for walking
in the summer i often leave home early in the morning and roam about fields and lanes
or even escape for days or weeks together
leonard is unable to acknowledge in any way that he recognizes the words or her voice
but he does
and as she reads the words become alive and the walls recede
but saving in the country i seldom go out until after dark though heaven be thanked i love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the earth as
much as any creature living
and he is moving into the light
