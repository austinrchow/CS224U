screenplay by george lucas gloria katz willard huyck on a dark screen an immense amber light appears and an electric humming begins
the eerie light glows brighter and illuminates a single huge number
we hear static and a large vertical band of red floats mysteriously across the screen
pulling back slowly we watch the glowing band traverse back and forth over the amber light and past more numbers appearing
and we begin to hear voices strange songs fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static
pulling back further we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations were hearing until the indicator stops
theres a pause
and suddenly we are hit by a blasting out of the past rocking and rolling turn up the volume pounding intro to a vintage golden week end radio show back
when things were simpler and the music was better
and now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary wolfman jack hits the airwaves his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds
awwrigght baay haay baay
i got a oldie for ya gonna knock ya right on de flowa baay haay hee baay
the wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as rock around the clock blasts forth
a neon drive in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill
a large neon sign buzzes in the foreground
mels drive in while in the background rock around the clock blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled white with red trim tuck and rolled chevy impala
that glides into the drive in
main titles appear over action
steve bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out
he looks around then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame covered hood
steve is eighteen good looking in a conservative button down short sleeved shirt
most likely to succeed president of his graduating class
he looks around the empty drive in then hears a funny little horn
a vespa scooter bumps into the lot
a young kid waves at him and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples
terry fields the toad maneuvers the scooter next to steves chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping
terry grins sheepishly
hes seventeen short but plenty loud both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt levis and white bucks
he looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks hes projecting an air of supercool
steve watches terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead
he unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough
terry walks over and leans against the flamed car imitating steve who pays him no mind
in the background we hear the wolfman howling with the music
the record ends and a barrage of humor begins from wolfman jack
the wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids
witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts hes their best friend confidant and guardian angel
now a grey insect like citroen deux chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot
steve and terry watch curt henderson get out
curt stands by his little car
hes seventeen a curly bespectacled scraggly kid with a summer grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts
curt thinks of himself as the town cynic
in reality hes a hopeless romantic
he starts over to his buddies
hey whadaya say
last night in town you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave
the moose have been lookin for you all day man
steve reaches into his pocket and hands curt an envelope without saying anything
curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check
sarcastic oh great
whadaya got whadaya got
wow two thousand dollars
two thousand doll steve looks at curt suspiciously curt seems somehow guilty
jenning couldnt find you so he gave it to me to give to you
he said hes sorry its so late but its the first scholarship the moose lodge has given out
oh yeah he says theyre all very proud of you
curt hands the envelope back to steve
why dont you hold onto it for a while
whats with you
i dont want it
ill take it
ah i think wed better have a talk
ive gotten suddenly a horn honks and they all turn
laurie henderson pulls into the drive in and waves to them
she is driving the familys edsel
your sister calls
ill talk to you later
let her wait
okay make it short and sweet
clearing his throat i
i dont think im going tomorrow
come on what are you talking about
i dont know
i was thinking i might wait for a year
go to city laurie honks the horn a couple of times
steve ignores her
there is a long moment and curt looks uncomfortable
you chicken fink
wait let me explain you cant back out now
after all we went through to get accepted
were finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell look i gotta talk to laurie
he hands the check back to curt now take it
were leaving in the morning
suddenly theres an ear splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow ford deuce coupe chopped lowered and sporting a hemi v bumps into the lot
the low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in
big john milner twenty two sits in his ford tough and indifferent puffing on a camel
he wears a white t shirt and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail
a cowboy in a deuce coupe simple sentimental and cocksure of himself
you wanna end up like john
you cant stay seventeen forever
i just want some time to think
whats the rush
ill go next year
well talk later
steve walks off toward lauries edsel
laurie gets out
shes wearing a lettermans sweater with a large class of emblazoned on the shoulder
steve goes to her and they hug
on the radio the music ends and the wolfmans intro tune comes on
singing here comes the wolfman wolfman jack
oh were gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby
you got the wolfman jack show
as the radio blares sixteen candles we see that with the darkness burger city has come alive
a continual line of hot rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars then returns to the maindrag
carhops glide by on roller skates
curt and john are fooling around in front of the deuce coupe
a horn honks and they turn as a ford with three girls in it slows by them
a girl leans out the window and smiles
the girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off
not too good huh
why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly
or has a boyfriend
where is the dazzling beauty ive been searching for all my life
john watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night
i know what you mean
the pickins are really gettin slim
the whole strip is shrinking
ah you know i remember about five years ago take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit
it was really somethin
suddenly in the distance theres a blood curdling scream from an incredible high performance engine
the entire drive in stops and listens
someone new in town
you gonna go after him
hey listen professor if he cant find me then he aint worth racin right
the big shot
across the swarming parking lot steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with laurie
budda macrae a car hop leans down to attach a tray to steves window showing off her tight blouse
a cherry vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain
anything else you want steve
steve shakes his head
if there is you let me know now
just honk and im yours
she tucks in her blouse a little tighter gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray
budda takes the other tray around the car almost shoves it in the window where laurie is sitting
one fries grab it before i drop it
she gives laurie an antagonistic look and goes off
shes seventeen very pretty with big doe eyes and a short bobbed hairdo
she pushes up the sleeves on steves letterman sweater which is sizes too large for her
his class ring glints on a chain around her neck
laurie is sweet the image of vulnerability but with a practical and self preserving mind beneath
where was i
um how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought i was kinda cute and funny but then you suddenly realized you
were in love with me it was serious
oh you were leadin up to somethin kinda big
you make it sound like im giving dictation
well seriously what i meant was that ah
since we do care for each other so much and since we should really consider ourselves as adults
now i ah
could i have a couple of those fries
through the windshield of the chevy they see terry run by in front of them chasing budda macrae whos outdistancing him on her roller skates
come on budda
steve watches them go by then looks back at laurie
ah where was i
consider ourselves adults
laurie pretends to be interested in her french fries but is obviously expecting something big
anyway i thought maybe before i leave we could ah
that seeing other people while im away cant possibly hurt you know
laurie hasnt looked up but her mood has changed like a mask
you mean dating other people
i think it would strengthen our relationship
then wed know for sure that were really in love
not that theres any doubt
steve smiles and then looks to her
he stops smiling
they listen to the radio for an awkward moment
laurie struggles to hold back her tears
with obvious difficulty she turns to him and smiles
hes expected something different and doesnt know what to do so he smiles back
i think youre right
i mean were not kids anymore and its silly to think that when were three thousand miles apart we shouldnt be able to see other people and go out
laurie takes his ring on the chain from around her neck and puts it in her purse
laurie now listen i didnt ask for that back
i think that
i just sort of think its juvenile now
ill keep it at home
its less conspicuous there
you dont want to wear it
i didnt say that
i understand and im not upset
i mean i cant expect you to be a monk or something while youre away
steve just looks at her and nods
the wolfman howls an intro to gee by the crows
outside skooting around the drive in after budda terry is pleading with the sexy car hop as she delivers a tray to a car
and i have a really sharp record collection
i even have pledging my love by johnny ace
anyway how can you love nelson when hes going out with marilyn gator
since he dumped on you maybe we could he didnt dump on me you little dip
her tone changes immediately
terry looks sour and turns around to steve whos getting out of the chevy
budda leaves wiggling her butt for steve
shes a little conceited just playing hard to get
listen i came over here to talk to you about any time buddy
im your man
nothing i like better than chewing the rug with a pal
you talk ill listen
im all ears
terry im going to let you take care of my car while were away at least until christmas
im afraid if i leave it with my steve notices terry isnt with him any more and turns
terry is standing frozen to a spot
terry tries to talk much like a shell shocked war veteran
his mouth moves but only a gurgle comes out
curt is standing by the chevy talking with his sister laurie
shes still upset by what steve said to her
hey sis whats wrong
meanwhile they watch terry as steve explains to him about the car
now listen only weight castrol r
ive written the tire pressure and stuff on a pad in the glove compartment
are you listening
the others are watching now as terry shakes his head mechanically
whats wrong hes crying
there is indeed a tear rolling down terrys cheek
he starts toward the car and gently caresses its paint
i dont know what to say
love and protect this car until death do us part
he circles the car
this is a superfine machine
this may even be better than daryl starbirds superfleck moonbird
it is better than daryl starbirds
laurie watches terry realizing that like the car shell be left behind as a fond memory
she turns and looks at steve whos been watching her
theres a moment between them
budda comes by with an empty tray
terry sees her and wipes his eyes
he walks up to her a strange look on his face
budda how would you like to go to the drive in movies with me
the idea is so preposterous that even budda is speechless
she looks around at others
youve got to be kidding
would i kid you about a thing like that
i want you to know that something has happened to me tonight that is going to change everything
ive got a new
john walks up quietly and casually pulls down hard on the back pockets of terrys low riding levis
there is general hysteria as terry quickly pulls up his pants
all right whos the wise he turns and sees john and changes his tune
oh john verrry funny
he tries to laugh with the others
hey did she do that to you
lets get going
it seems like weve spent most of our lives in this parking lot
hey curt lets bomb around i wanna try out my new wheels
id like to toad but im going with steve and laurie to the hop
id just slow you down anyway
yeah tonight things are going to be different
hey wait a minute youre goin to the hop

john walks angrily to his coupe gets in and slams the door
curt looks at the others and shrugs
jesus milner youre in a great mood tonight
curt goes over and stands by the window of the yellow coupe
whats the matter john
did i say somethin wrong
ah man its nothin
well well see you later okay
well all do somethin together
you know before steve leaves
john looks at him suspiciously
okay wait a minute
now youre not going
i dont know
john shakes his head
on the radio wolfman is taking a call from a listener wolfman
who is this
this is joe
in little rock way down in the valley
you callin from little rock california
my my my
listen man what kind of entertainment you got in that town
all we got is you
john roars his engine and pulls the yellow deuce coupe into a screeching take off out of the drive in
terry and curt watch him go off
during the day g street is a line of used car lots small shops tacky department stores and greasy spoons
at night it is transformed into an endless parade of kids in flamed lowered and customed machines who rumble down the one way street through the seemingly adultless heat drugged
police cars glide ominously with the flow of traffic
in parked cars couples neck between flashing headlights
guys looking cool in a chevy sit in the slouched position of the true low rider and over it all the music and the wolfman can be heard
just now its runaway by del shannon
john travels with the flow of traffic watching some dopey guys shooting squirt guns from a moving car
john drives the deuce coupe effortlessly
he looks over at a car pacing alongside of his own
a sweaty looking guy turns and nods from the window
hey man what happened to your flathead
what happened to your flathead
ah your mother
hey we been talkin about you
theres a very wicked chevy lookin for you
yeah i know
watch out for the cop thats in jerrys cherry
all right thanks
john nods and the two cars pull apart down the street
the rock and roll blares as terry the toad cruises along the main drag singing along with the music
sitting low in his seat he looks around his face aglow experiencing a new world from the inside of a really fine car
this is the greatest thing that has happened to terry in seventeen long years of being a short loser
terry turns a corner and another car pulls alongside
a guy looks out the window
terry looks over and smiles coolly proud of his new wheels
leaning out the window is that you in that beautiful car
terry nods modestly geez what a waste of machinery
terrys smile changes to a scowl as the car pulls away from him
terry accounts the slight to jealousy
then he forgets it and enjoys driving the beautiful chevy again
another car pulls alongside of him as he cruises along slowly
terry looks over at the car cruising next to him
in the back seat a guy has dropped his trousers and is pushing his bare buttocks against the side window a classic ba complete with pressed ham
terry looks away wondering why this is still happening to him even in his new car
curt is in the back seat gazing out the window at the dark main street of the small farm community
steve and laurie are talking quietly in the front seat
laurie is sitting near the window and it sounds like steve is convincing her to move over
laurie finally does
his arm goes around her and her head rests on his shoulder
curt is laughing as the wolfman harasses someone on the radio
the wolfman is placing a call
here we go with another call out of the station
can you dig it
answer the phone dummy
pinkies pizza ah yeah listen you got any more of those secret agent spy scopes
hit parade on the stethoscope
no the secret agent spy scope man
that pulls in the moon the sky and the planets
and the satellites and the little bitty space men
you must have the wrong number partner
wolfman cuts into why do fools fall in love
curt is laughing in the back of the car as he listens to the ever present d
steve slows the edsel to a stop at the next light
curt glances over at a classic white thunderbird and sits up
in the t bird a girl watches him
blonde beautiful her hair backlit by a used car lot seems to glow making her look almost ethereal
curt doesnt move as if afraid of scaring her away
she smiles faintly then says something so softly its lost
curt struggles to lower his window
she repeats it but he cant hear
the light changes
she smiles once more and is gone
we didnt say anything
hang a right
cut over to g street ive just seen a vision
she was a goddess
youve got to catch her
i didnt see anything
were not going to spend the night chasing girls for you
im telling you this was the most perfect dazzling creature ive ever seen
she spoke to me
she spoke to me right through the window
i think she said i love you
curt looks at his sister and steve in the front seat
they are bored by his romantic visions
that means nothing to you people
you have no romance no soul
she someone wants me
someone roaming the streets wants me
will you turn the corner
laurie looks around at him and seems to pity his flights of poetic fantasy
curt sits back and shakes his head
big john sits in his deuce coupe backed into the parking lot of the acme fall out shelter co
the prime spot in town for girl watching
a guy in wrap around dark glasses leans by the car next to john
they watch a group of laughing girls cruise by in a studebaker
john turns on his lights and swings the deuce coupe out into the flow of traffic after the studebaker
john accelerates and pulls alongside the studebaker
the girl in the front seat rolls down her window
john grins and yells over at the carload of cuties
hey youre new around here
wherere you from
you know a guy named frank bartlett
does he go to turlock high
well he used to
he goes to j

im sorry i cant
im going steady
ah come on
i just cant
youre just ridin around with a bunch of girls
hey how about somebody else in there
anybody else want to go for a ride
the girls chatter and giggle among themselves
one of the girls dangles a bra out the back window and they all break into hysterical laughter
the girls try to accelerate ahead but john stays alongside their car
aw come on
i got plenty of room
its dangerous to have that many people in a car
cops see ya youre had
you got nothing to fear im as harmless as a baby kitten
a small voice rises above the chatter
judys sister wants to ride with you
is that all right
grinning yeah sure judy her sister her mother anybody
ill take em all
listen well go up and stop at that light
itll turn red by the time we get there
the first girl grins and nods
john winks at her
you ever get tired of going steady with somebody that aint around im up for grabs
the cars stop at the light
a girl rushes out from the studey and runs around the back of johns coupe
she opens the door and climbs in fast as the light changes
the studebaker pulls off fast
john pushes through the gears and turns and smiles at his pick up as thatll be the day plays on the wolfman jack show
so youre judys little sister
carol morrison shakes her head
she is thirteen years old very cute wearing blue jeans sneakers and a dewey webber surf board t shirt which hangs to her knees
john seems slightly panicked
ah shit how old are you
how old are you
im too old for you
you cant be that old
i think you better go back and sit with your sister
where are they anyway
they comin back or somethin
this is a joke right
this better be a joke cause im not drivin you around
but you asked me
whats the matter
am i too ugly
on the verge of tears judy doesnt want me with her and now you dont want me with you
nobody wants me
even my mother and father hate me
everybody hates me
no they dont
i mean i dont know maybe they do
but i dont
its just that youre a little young for me
i am not
if you throw me out ill scream
ok ok just stay cool
theres no need to scream
well think of something
he looks at her as she wipes her eyes
it shouldnt take too long to find your sister again
suddenly a car horn honks next to them
john looks over at the car
hey john you gonna be there tonight
hey get down
john grabs carol by the neck and pushes her head down onto his lap so she cant be seen
john casually waves to the friend in the car cruising alongside
carols head is being held down on his lap
she looks up at him
hey is this what they call copping a feel
john jumps and immediately lets go of her as if burned
dont even say that
john is beginning to sweat now
whats your name
mud if anybody sees you
terry continues to cruise the main drag slouched low and looking cool in his newly acquired machine
he adjusts his waterfall curl as the wolfman dedicates a list of songs
he passes a group of guys bullshitting around the raised hood of a souped up parked car
terry cruises alongside two girls in a ford
he revs the engine to get their attention and once he has it he motions to roll down their window
they flip him the bird instead and he lets them pass
terry pulls up to a stop light
the car next to him is a ford a good opponent and besides the kid driving looks younger than terry
what you got in there kid
more than you can handle
terry revs his engine
so does the ford
the tension mounts
the green arrow for the left turn lane flashes on the car on terrys other side moves off and before he can control his reflexes terry too has shot into
the intersection while the light remains red
terry quickly shifts and returns to the starting position
the other driver is grinning
terry is flustered and embarrassed
terry revs the chevy a couple more times concentration intently this time on the right light
the ford bolts into the intersection
terry likewise floors the gas pedal and goes crashing backwards into a large buick
terry is stunned for a moment then realizes he forgot to shift into first
he fumbles to get the car into first gear
a distinguished looking man comes up to his window after inspecting the damage
terry tries to escape but in his panic the engine dies
he struggles to start it
excuse me but i think weve had an accident
well goddamnit i wont report you this time but next time just watch it will ya
terry roars off in a cloud of indignant smoke leaving the gentleman standing in the street looking dismayed
the cars behind him begin to honk their horns and shout crudities
terry pulls up in front of a used car lot and jumps out to inspect the damage to steves chevy
he rubs a small scratch on the back fender but it wont disappear
as he spits on it a slick baggy suited car salesman ambles up
ill give you for her on a practically new corvette
and on top of this im going to know off the low price of this beautiful vette
im talking about only down and a month
now how am i able to make you this incredible offer
ill tell you
im forced to move all the sporty cars off the lot as quickly as i can
he doesnt want em
i think its a mistake but what can i do
terry begins to get worried as the salesman begins to fondle his new chevy
he becomes frightened as the salesman attempts to drag him over to one of the vettes
finally terry breaks away and jumps back into his car and the salesman continues to rave on as terry drives away
herbie and the heartbeats wearing their matching red blazers rock into a raunchy rendition of their masterpiece one two three four one two three four bah
at the hop
pulling back from the bandstand we see the dewey high school gym the basketball nets swung back and draped with crepe the lights half low the noise high and the
waxed floor being polished and pounded by stockinged feet as a seething mob of adolescents join in that ancient rite the hop
a hundred of them are dancing and swaying while the band gyrates on a raised platform
kids on wooden bleachers watch the whirling and spinning mass of ponytails and ducktails button down shirts and mid calf skirts cardigan sweaters with little belts in the back
laurie stands in front of a mirror in a line of other girls
she brushes her hair staring rather despondently at herself in the mirror
the girl next to her is peg fuller a cute cheerleader
hey why are you so depressed
youll forget him in a week
listen after youre elected senior queen youll have so many boys after your bod i dont want to go out with anybody else
laurie i know its a drag but you cant remember what happened to evelyn chelnick
when mike went to the marines
she had a nervous breakdown and was acting so wacky she got run over by a bus
i just wish i could go with him or something
we move down a row of sinks at which guys are working as intently on their coiffures as the girls
ducktails being smoothed glassy waterfalls being primped the fronts of crew cuts being waxed to stand stiff
steve stands looking at himself then glances at eddie quentin standing next to him dabbing something on his face
eddie jerks his hand down and hides something
steve turns and pulls eddies hand up
hey zit make up
laughing wait till i tell hey everybody eddie come on steve dont
just cool it
he takes his pimple cream back and steve continues to laugh
he stops slowly and looks at himself again in the mirror
he finds something on his neck looks around at eddie
quietly let me see some of that stuff
eddie gives him the tube and steve dabs it on his neck
you leave tomorrow
you and laurie engaged yet
no but we got it worked out
were still going together but we can date other people
and screw around i hear college girls really give out
suddenly a voice shouts one two they turn to see a guy at every toilet hit the flusher on three sending a torrent of water down the pipes
suddenly theres a rumbling noise as the pipes break and water gushes over the floor
everybody crashes for the doors laughing and shoving each other
the guys tumble out the lavatory door and abruptly cool it as a dumb looking paunchy teacher stops and looks them over rocking on his heels
they escape quietly
steve and eddie meet laurie coming out of the girls lavatory with peg
theyre watching the dancers as hervie and his band moan through a slow number shes so fine
come on what
laurie i want to dance
whos stopping you
eddie and peg are listening and watching
steve smiles at them like everythings okay
he glares at laurie
under his breath laurie i thought since this was our last night together for months you might want to dance with me
youll be back at christmas
i want to dance now not at christmas
he takes her arm which she pulls away
get your cooties off me eddie and peg are watching with great interest
steve smiles at them again
then he leans down and whispers something to laurie
go ahead slug me scar my face
i wouldnt dance with you if you were the last guy left in this gym
uh peg i think we should dance
no this is getting good
ill dance with you eddie
you dont mind do you peggy
she takes eddie by the hand and leaves steve fuming with peg
joe college strikes out
steve gives her a snide look then watches laurie and eddie laughing as they join in the stroll
the whole gym is strolling in unison like some strange musical military formation
the stroll music floats from the gym down the empty hall
curt walks along with his hands in his pockets
one last trip down the grey locker lined corridor
he slows and stops by locker
he smiles a little then flips the dial of the lock
once to the right back to the left then to the right again
curt hits the handle
it doesnt open
he shrugs and goes off down the hallway
curt walks in the background behind the line of kids clapping as one couple strolls down between them
then curt hears somebody call him
curt wanders over toward a young teacher mr
wolfe who is surrounded by a group of admiring and grade seeking girls
wolfe wears ivy league clothes and is about twenty five not much older than his students
curtis come here
help me will you
you wont dance
no really id like to but i cant
i mean if old mr
simpson came in here and saw me dancing with one of you sexy little excuse me
one of you young ladies hed have my rear end
the all giggle
wolfe shrugs at curt and heads for a door
curt follows him and they escape from the girls into the night
curt and mr
wolfe come out of the gym
wolfe sees a couple of guys skulking around in the shadows smoking cigarettes and laughing
the music has changed to see you in september
come on gentlemen back inside
put em out
grinning as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes kids
taking one from the pack all right
hey i thought youd left
no not yet
looking for matches i have no matches
wolfe takes out a pack of matches and lights both their cigarettes
they walk down a chain link fence past dark venetian blinded classrooms
brother how do i get stuck with dance supervision
will you tell me that
you going back east
boy i remember the day i went off
got drunk as hell the night before
barfed on the train all the next day
whered you go again

and only stayed a semester
smiling and nodding one semester
and after all that i came back here
shrugging decided i wasnt the competitive type
i dont know
maybe i was scared
well you know i might find im not the competitive type myself
what do you mean
well im not really sure that im going
hey now dont be stupid
have some fun curtis
then a voice calls from the shadows
they turn and see a girl coming out of a doorway
wolfe looks at jane one of his students but doesnt say anything
i mean mr
can i speak with you a minute
she smiles at curt
he looks at mr
wolfe who seems a little embarrassed
wolfe sticks out his hand
anyway good luck curtis
curt shakes his hand
ill see you
thanks a lot
curt walks back toward the gym
looking around he sees mr
wolfe standing in the shadows with the girl talking intimately
curt turns away and goes off
before going back into the gym curt stops
he sees a white t bird parked among a row of cars in the parking lot
he walks then starts running toward the car
theres a blonde sitting in the front seat making out with some guy
curt leans down to the window and is about to say something to his dream girl
but she turns and he sees its not her
her boyfriend glares at him like hes some kind of peeping tom
curt backs away awkwardly trying to smile
the yellow ford coupe is gliding down the street skimming around corners gracefully as the night lights glide up its lacquered hood
inside the car carol glances at john and smiles
the wolfman is howling on the radio
a wolfman exclusive for ya now
the beach boys baby a brand new group
i predict they gonna go a long way
this is called surfin safari
carol is continuing to jabber on relating past adventures with her little friends
john is unimpressed
so the next night we found out where they parked and went out with ammunition
dont you have homework or something to do
no sweat my mother does it
anyway he thought he was had
he started the car and couldnt see through the windshield and zoomed straight into the canal it was a riot
john smiles sarcastically
i still got some so dont try anything
she takes a pressurized can of shaving cream and squirts his nose
he swipes the shaving cream on his nose swerving a car honks
hey watch it will ya
jesus christ thanks a lot
looking at her angrily hey drivin is a serious business
i aint havin no accidents because of you
carol sinks into her corner of the car
she sticks her tongue out for a quick moment
catching her look come on dont give me any grief
im warning ya

he stares at her and she shuts up
surfin safari is blaring on the radio and she starts twisting with the music
john turns the radio off

rock n rolls been going downhill ever since buddy holly died
dont you think the beach boys are boss
you would you grungy little twerp
you big weenie if i had a boyfriend hed pound you

she looks around and sees a police car following them bubble lights aglow
good a cop im going to tell him you tried to rape me
john pulls the car over and stops

the cop is tapping at johns window
john wipes his face

john rolls down his window
he looks at the surly cop

holstein looks at him then steps back looks at the car
holsteins only a couple years older than john but the uniform separates them by light years
milner the reason i stopped you was because the light on your license plate is out
opening his ticket book im gonna have to cite you for that
and milner the front end of this
this thing youre driving looks a little low
oh no sir

holstein just glares at him and then leans in close through the window

i could run you in right now and i could make it stick
but im not gonna do that milner you know why
john shakes his head no

holstein drops the ticket through the window onto johns lap
he starts back to his patrol car
when hes out of earshot john answers
thank you asshole
looking over at him youre a regular j
here file that under c
carol takes the ticket and opens the glove compartment
whats that stand for
chicken shit thats what it is
she looks amazed as she adds the new ticket to a mess of similar tickets crammed in the glove compartment
the police car pulls by them
john scowls then roars his engine and pulls back into the stream of traffic
terry is looking and feeling like hes got it made
he downshifts and slows for a red light
a very mean looking black chevy blown scooped and slicked pulls up next to him
the driver bob falfa has a gum chewing girlfriend sitting almost on top of him
terry challenges the chevy by revving his engine
bob falfa doesnt even look over
he revs his engine which sounds like a cross between a boeing and a superchief
terry cant believe it
he quits revving his engine feeling deflated
terry looks over at the snotty grin on falfas girlfriends face
aint he neat
terry doesnt say anything and bob falfa glares over at him
hey you know a guy around here with a piss yellow deuce coupe supposed to be hot stuff
you mean john milner
falfa nods slowly
hey nobody can beat him man
hes got the fastest i aint nobody dork
hey you see this milner you tell him im lookin for him huh
tell him i aim to blow his ass right off the road
giving another snotty smile aint he neat
terry doesnt say anything
theres another incredible scream as falfa roars off leaving terry to stare through his smoke
terry accelerates the chevy at a prudent speed
as the radio blares almost grown terry glides past the lighted stores slowly taking in everything with wide eyes from his beautiful new car
terry passes a steaming rear end collision at an intersection where two guys and two girls are all yelling
then suddenly he spots a girl walking alone
his mouth drops open in amazement as he slows to a crawl
debbie nineteen with blonde hair wearing a blue and white spaghetti strap dress strolls along the sidewalk
terry rolls the powerful engine but she ignores him
as he passes her he speeds up
what a babe
what a bitchin babe
and wolfman baby shes all mine
terry tears around the corner and starts his approach once more
he quickly whips out his comb touches up his hair and settles down into a comfortable slouch
okay honey here i come james dean lives
he hits the clutch roars the engine a couple more times and then disaster
debbie passes behind some rough looking dudes on motorcycles parked along the curb
one especially vicious biker turns and looks at terry as he passes
terry roars off around the block
stay cool honey dont let those creeps bug you
wolfman please dont let those creeps bug her
as debbie passes the bikers they hoot holler and make barnyard noises
from the cat calls and debbies manner it seems obvious that debbie is a girl a lot of boys have known
she has walked clear of the bikers as terry screeches around the corner again
he pulls up alongside her and again slows to a crawl
the pass each other for awhile but she doesnt look over
lowering his voice hello
need a lift
nice night for a walk
do you know john milner
sure you wouldnt like a ride somewhere
did anyone ever tell you that you look just like connie stevens
this stops her and she turns terry hits the brakes and the car bounces
i mean it
just like connie stevens
i met her once
at a dick clark road show
debbie starts slowly toward the car
you really think i look like her
no shit excuse me i mean im not just feeding you a line

i always though i looked like sandra dee
oh yeah well you look a lot like her too

i just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery
well come on in ill let you feel it
i mean you can touch it if you want realizing its coming out wrong he gets nervous i mean the upholstery you know
terry is elated
he climbs out of the car and she slides in the drivers side
terry climbs back in next to her and slams the door
shes sitting right next to him like a real date should
terry gets a little nervous
i love it when guys peel out
terry nods checks his clutch revs the engine to a high pitched whine and theyre off the tires smoke scream the car shots off fish tailing nearly hitting a parked
car straightening out
and disappears down main street
on stage the band is taking five
theyre looking tough for the girls while the student body secretary is making announcements at the mike
a great band and they came all the way from stockton
lets hear it
theres applause as the girl continues
and we want to thank darby langdon who did all these neat decorations
theres more applause
standing among the crowd steve and laurie both look angry
i dont care if you leave this second
into the mike now the next dance is gonna be a snowball and leading it off is last years class president steven bolander and this years head cheerleader laurie henderson
theres applause whistles and cheers from the crowd
a blue spotlight floats over the dance floor and then lands on steve and laurie who are in the midst of their argument
whats wrong with you
youre acting like a snotty laurie squints into the spotlight and realizes everybodys watching them
oh god come on
come on what
pulling him toward the floor oh steven please everybodys watching
smile or something
steve gives a sick smile as she drags him out onto the floor
a record needle scratches and smoke gets in your eyes blares out as steve and laurie dance alone in the middle of the floor
the crowd quiets getting a little misty about this soon to be separated teenage couple
for their part steve and laurie are arguing whispering in each others ears
you think i care if you go off
you think im going to crack up or something
are you conceited
quit quit pinching i dont know why i ever started taking you out in the first place
he takes her hand from the tucked under the chin position and puts it around him in a bear hug
you take me out
when we first met you didnt have enough sense to take the garbage out
i asked you out remember
what do you mean you asked me out
backwards day remember
if i had waited for you to ask me even after that you didnt call me for two weeks
i was busy
you were scared
dave oboler told me
then when you did ask me out you didnt kiss me for three dates
well i was scared jim kaylor told me
i even asked my father why you hadnt kissed me
your father great
he said he thought you were bright and youd probably think of kissing me after a while
you didnt of course
i had to
remember that picnic
out at the canyon
you cant remember anything the first one up at the lake
that was the first time you kissed me i practically had to throw myself at you
quietly i remember
they continue to dance slowly
laurie starts to cry hating herself for it
steve loosens a minute and looks at her
go to hell
he holds her tighter and they circle the floor all alone the crowd watching quietly the gym echoing with smoke gets in your eyes
curt is leaning against a car in the parking lot
hes looking up at the stars and listening to the music floating out from the gym
what are you doin stealing hub caps
a pretty dark haired girl wendy slides up next to him and leans against the car
theres an awkward pause like that which happens often when two people who used to be close meet after things have changed
well hey wendy
howve you been
howve you been
a horn honks and wendy turns to a vw thats idling nearby
im coming wait a sec
turning back to curt shes got her car
hey i thought you were going away to school
same old curt
all the time we were going together you never knew what you were doing
well anyway i gotta go
hey wendy where are you going
smiling at her well you mind if i come along
they go off toward the vw and climb in
the hop is almost over and the lights have been lowered conservatively
steve and laurie hold each other hardly moving and he kisses her
still kissing they continue to circle slowly until a short totally bald teacher comes and pokes steve in the side
all right bolander break it up
you know the rules
you and your panting girlfriend want to do that youll have to go someplace else
he gives them a disgusted look and starts off
the teacher turns surprised by the omission of mr
why dont you go kiss a duck
kroots beady eyes widen and he comes back
what did you say
i said go kiss a duck marblehead
kroot is stunned and people have stopped dancing to watch bolander youre suspended
youre dont even come monday
you are out
smiling broadly i graduated last semester
suddenly everything has changed
kroot is furious but unable to do anything
he finally storms off in a huff
steve laurie and the people watching all laugh
to laurie get your shoes
lets go before we get thrown out
steve and laurie walk toward her edsel
in the background wolfman jack is taking a phone call from someone
this is weird willard
hold on a minute let me get my pants off
steve opens the door to the car and then turns laurie and kisses her
why dont we go to the canal
teasing what for
listen i can get tough with you too you know
yeah hard tough
she kisses him and they get into the car
as they pull out the wolfman continues his conversation on the radio
i got em down around my knees man
wear these tight pants
i cant get em
all right im gonna do my little dance now man
and the wolfman goes into an insane rain dance rhythm as we hear little darlin terry not only looks cool now but is cool singing with the radio a girl
terry ever so slowly tries to put his arm around her but by the time he manages it he has to shift
they drive by some kids having a car to car water pistol war
i go to dewey too ya know
i never seen ya
i bug out a lot
when i graduate im going to join the marines
they got the best uniforms
but what if theres a war
with the bomb whos going to start it

terry stops trying to figure out where their conversation went
eddie burns oh yeah eddie burns
i met him once too
you really think i look like connie stevens
i like her tuesday weld is too much of a beatnik dont you think
yeah beatniks are losers
who do you like

terry slowly maneuvers his arm around her
ah hell i like most of the people you like
putting her head on his shoulder thats nice we got a lot in common
both of them start singing with the radio
suddenly she puts her hand on his leg
you know what id like more than anything in the world right now
terry almost does a comic strip gulp
id love a double chubby chuck
isnt that what youd like more than anything right now
the endless chrome flashing parade continues
among the lines of fine cars terry is parked in the chevy next to an order speaker on a metal pole
terry leans out the car window and orders into the intercom
a double chubby chuck a mexicali chili barb two orders of french fries and cherry cokes
the intercom clicks on and a garbled voice squawks back at him
ark wark dork
pushing the button now wait a minute
ark wark dork
as they wait for their order several guys in various passing cars yell sleazy greetings to debbie
suddenly a rough looking face belonging to vic lozier pops in her window
hows my soft baby
beat it vic
im not your baby
terry nervously pretends not to hear
oh come on honey
so i never called you back
ive been you know busy
besides it only took one night for me to realize that if brains were dynamite you couldnt blow your nose
look whos talking
whos the wimp youre hanging out with now

she looks out the window down at vics pants it shows
hey now his voice cracks i mean hey now buddy the lady obviously doesnt look creep you want a knuckle sandwich
ah no thanks im waiting for a double chubby chuck
then shut your smart ass mouth

vic makes a kiss off noise
she lights a match and flicks it at him
he finally leaves

thats why i like you youre different
you really think im intelligent
she moves very close to him and whispers in his ear
and ill bet youre smart enough to get us some brew
she kisses him yes
this place is too crowded anyway
terry backs out and drives off leaving the approaching car hop standing in an empty parking space
what about your double chubby chuck mexicali chili barb and looking at the tray two cherry cokes sir
we see the white t bird ahead for just a moment before it accelerates passes a car and disappears as we hear peppermint twist from the radio
in the vw curt is in the back shaking the drivers seat yelling at bobbie
wendy is in front next to bobbie
there dont you see it
speed up youre losing her quit shouting in my ear
cut around him cut around him
the little vw swerves and cuts around an old dagoed dodge then speeds along the fast lane
ahead we catch a glimpse of the t bird as it turns a corner
there hang a right over there
bobbie turns somebody honks she hits the curb shifting madly she mis clutches the beetle lugs forward curt falls back in the seat and wendy looks at him
you lost her

ah wendy my old lover come back here and console me

to bobbie did you know that my ex is going to become a presidential aide
its supposed to be a secret but his big ambition in life is to shake hands with president kennedy

maybe you should shut up
maybe i will
and maybe i wont
why dont you move your bod into aft chamber where we might discuss this in private
seeing that wendy is considering it thanks a lot
come on wendy
she doesnt say anything
they pull up to a stoplight
wendy looks at the red stoplight and then abruptly gets out of the car and jumps in the back
well slide over im not sitting on your lap
she gets in and the car goes off
in the back seat curt and wendy are talking softly
he puts his arm around her and she makes a face but doesnt remove it
bobbie watches in the rear view mirror curt sees her
to the opera james
unless you want to go to gallo dam and have an orgy
curt looks at her and turns her head
he kisses her and puts his arm around her
the radio plays barbara ann
the little vw flashes by in the stream of traffic
bobbie drives glancing in here rear view mirror occasionally and also watching the station wagon ahead in which two pairs of feet are dancing against the back window
wendy pulls away from curts lips and looks out the window
ive been silly
im glad youre going to stay
maybe well have some classes together
from the front seat look theres kip pullman
hes so neat
wendy turns and leans forward laughing
curt watches her seriously studying her
do you know kip
yeah i know him

they pull up next to kips car and curt leans forward and yells out bobbies window
kip baby whats up
henderson long time no see
whadaya been doing
not much just wanted to let you know that bobbie here is hopelessly in love with you and trembles at the sight of your rippling biceps
bobbie swerves the car away and turns a corner
she stops on a dime at the curb
you creep fink son of a bitch she turns and starts flailing at curt with her purse
joke joke bobbie remember your nose bleeds
get out get out of my car i hate you
excuse me ouch wendy i got to go now
wendy is laughing and curt climbs over her out of the small car
he gets out and closes the door
wendy changes seats and looks at him seriously
curt i hope i see you at registration
call me if you want
it was nice seeing you again
the car pulls off and curt watches it
suddenly he sees something the t bird going the other way down the street
oh shit there
the vws gone and curt starts after the t bird on foot
he runs down the middle of the street oblivious to the horns honking and the cars swerving to miss him
we move with curt as he moves like a broken field runner through the traffic only to finally lose the girl and the thunderbird and to slow and finally stop
standing on the white line
cars slow down and kids rubberneck as they go by him
john is driving and the wolfman is howling on the radio while carol is having the time of her life
went to a dance lookin for romance
found barbara ann
hey this one is for all you out there watchin the submarine races
and the radio moans into who wrote the book of love
carol sits with her feet up against the dash
john knocks them off and she scowls at him
im so thirsty i could die
just a little cent coke to wet my whistle
it wont take a minute i can drink it in the john suddenly hits the brakes and carol almost hits the floor
john reaches over and opens the door
why dont you just get out and get one then
so long goodbye hasta lumbago
she stares at him shaken looking sweet and helpless
he turns and looks at her
a tear rolls down her cheek slowly
john cant take it
all right one coke and then home
carol is delighted
she slams the door
john takes off
isnt it great the way i can cry whenever i want
a lot of people cant do that but vicki showed me how
i bet you cant cry
dont count on it
i may surprise you any minute now
john cruises around the lot until he finds a space among the rows of dazzling cars
he pulls in and leans out to hit the intercom button
into intercom one ten cent coke
is ice extra
all right ice
thanks for nothing
she looks around sitting up so maybe some of her friends will see her in johns neat car
oh rats i though some of my friends might be here
probably a couple of weeks past their bedtime
wait theres dee dee
i hope she sees me
oh shit dee dee
a long line of cars coast past
occasionally someone yells a greeting to john
the car hop brings the coke
then a couple al and linda come over
they lean in the window smiling john prays they dont see carol
say do you think if i brought my mopar by the shop monday you could spot weld the bumper bracket

hey have you met linda
hi ahh this is my ahh cousin carol

she slugs john on the arm
john grabs her arm as she starts to swing again
jesus watch it will yuh

she struggles to hit him and spills her coke all over the car
he pushes her rather roughly against the door
watch out damn it
look what why dont you grow up
looking at al again we dont get along too well
its been like this you spastic creep
she is about to really cry this time
she jumps out of the car and runs off down the street
john wipes his car out as al and linda watch in amazement
we dont get along too well
you know what cousins are like
well ill see ya on monday before noon
john mutters profanities to himself but his anger subsides after a few moments
he looks back in the direction carol went
all he can see are two hells angels on choppers rolling in the same direction
he looks a little concerned and starts the coupe
john roars along looking for her until he sees her walking angrily along the sidewalk being followed by a ford full of guys
john passes carol and the ford and pulls over and stops just ahead of them
carol stops when she sees john
the ford also stops and the guys call out to her
she considers the situation a moment then runs and gets in with john
he pulls off and she grins at him happily
hi cousin hows your bod
terry pulls into the parking lot and stops
he looks up at the flashing liquor store sign and considers his battle plan
maybe baby by buddy holly is playing on the radio
do you have an id
hey but no sweat
whatll it be
beer little wine
if you could get some old harper id give you a french kiss
old harper rrright
he gives her an ok sign with his fingers and goes over to the store
he starts to enter then stops and thinks
he sees a man in a business suit approaching and smiles
excuse me sir while youre in there i mean since youre going in anyway i wonder if yes son
could you sir could you give me the time
looking at his watch why sure its a quarter to twelve
quarter to twelve
thanks a lot
the man regards him terry pretends to start off until the man goes in
terry pulls himself together as another man approaches or rather stumbles up being older scruffy and essentially a bum
pardon me sir but i lost my i
in in a flood and id like to get some old harper hard stuff
would you mind buying a bottle for me
the bum is still trying to focus on terry and smiles
why certainly i lost my wife too her name wasnt idy though and it wasnt in a flood but i know what ya thanks heres enough for a pint
the old man takes the money and falls into the store
terry watches and then waves to debbie in the car that everything is cool
as he waits for the bum to come back out the first man in the suit exits
terry smiles at him again
still quarter to twelve
the man gets into the car and backs out
terry goes over to the window of the liquor store and looks to see how the winos doing with his booze
terry sees the liquor store owner setting four bottles of cheap wine on the counter
gesturing through the window from outside hey no
the owner turns and sees terry waving
terry ducks out of sight
when he looks back again terry sees the old bum is gone
terry cant believe it
he finally enters the store
terry tries to look very casual as he sidles up to the counter
country western music hums over the liquor in hi fi
smiling at the owner hi there ah say was there an old man in here a minute ago
he went out the back
terry is destroyed
you want something
terry looks at the man and the endless rows of liquor behind him
yeah ah let me have a three musketeers ah and a ball point pen ther a comp a pint of old harper couple of flashlight batteries and some of this
the owner puts everything into a bag and starts to ring it up
okay got an i
for the liquor
oh sure feeling his pockets oh nuts i left it i left it in the car
sorry youll have to get it before well i cant
i also ah forgot the car
the owner takes the liquor out of the bag and puts it back on the shelf
terry stands there
the owner takes the money from him and gives him his change
terry comes back to the chevy with the bag full of junk
debbie smiles at him excitedly and scoots over to the window
hey did ya get it
ya get it ya get it
he hands her the bag
you got it
you got it
she goes through the bag and finds a comb and the batteries
you didnt get it
why didnt you get it
ah well i needed some things and i thought as long as i was in there look debbie can you loan me a dollar
are you for real
girls dont pay
yeah well see ive only got a fifty and he doesnt have change
well i cant believe this
i really cannot believe this
she takes the money from a squeeze open plastic change purse and hands it to him
terry smiles weakly and goes back to try his luck again at the liquor store
he stops in front of the door as a young guy with numerous tattoos on his bulging arms approaches the liquor store
hi excuse me
i was wondering could you ah buy you a bottle of booze
yeah i know
you lost your i
what kind do you want
amazed gee thats terrific
ah just some ah old harper
he takes terrys money and enters the store
the clerk hands the man a bottle of old harper
terry waves excitedly to debbie lowering his pants a bit
suddenly theres a gunshot
terry whirls to see the young man stuffing cash from the register into his pockets backing away with a smoking gun
he rushes out of the store tossing the bottle to terry and running off into the night
suddenly the owner emerges from behind the counter shooting wildly
terry ducks and heads for the car with his pint of old harper
johns deuce coupe crunches to a gravelly stop in front of a dark auto wrecking yard
john and carol get out and climb over the fence
they walk through a valley of twisted rusting piles of squashed mashed and crushed automobiles
john sticks his hand into his pockets moodily and stops and looks at one of the burnt out cars
thats freddy bensons vette
he got his head on with some drunk
never had a chance
damn good driver too
what a waste when somebody gets it and it aint even their fault
needs a paint job thats for sure
john doesnt hear her and walks on
that vette over there
walt hawkins a real ding a ling
wrapped it around a fig tree out on mesa vista with five kids in it
draggin with five kids in the car how dumb can you get
all the ding a lings get it sooner or later
maybe thats why they invented cars
to get rid of the ding a lings
tough when they take someone with them
you never had a wreck though you told me
i come pretty close a couple of times
almost rolled once
so far ive been quick enough to stay out of here
the quick and the dead
i bet youre the fastest
ive never been beaten lot of punks have tried
see that ford there
used to be the fastest wheels in the valley
i never got a chance to race old earl
he got his in in the hairiest crash ever happened around here
he was racing a chevy bored and loaded out on the old oakdale highway and every damn kid in town was out there
the chevy lost its front wheel doing about
the idiot had torched the spindles to lower the front end and it snapped right off
he slammed bam into the ford and then they both of them crashed into a row of cars and all those kids watchin
jesus eight kids killed including both drivers looked like a battlefield
board of education was so impressed they filmed it
show it now in drivers education maybe youll see it
anyway since then street racings gone underground
no spectators i mean
id love to see you race
carol takes his hand and they walk a bit until john realizes what hes doing and drops her hand and pulls away
none of that
im the one whos supposed to say that
whadaya afraid of
ill keep it above the waist
he looks at her for a moment who knows in a few years but not now bunny rabbit
oh brother you are such a drip
she stomps off and gets back into the coupe quickly rolling up all the windows
john saunters up and finds the door locked
come on open the door
if you say carols not a bunny shes a foxy little tail
john grins and starts to pull his keys out of his pocket
he stops grinning carol grins and dangles his keys inside the car
john leans against the window closes his eyes a defeated man
quietly carols not a rabbit shes a foxy little tail
he hears the button click up and slowly opens the door
you say the cutest things
john gets into the car
sneakin around with the wolfman baby
the wolfmans gravelly voice whispers over the airwaves as john and carol drive out of the shadowy car grave yard
curt is sitting on the hood of a parked de soto watching a row of televisions in the window of an appliance store
twelve silent images of ricky nelson on ozzie and harriet glow in the dark showroom
music from passing cars rises and fades as they cruise behind curt
the wolfman can be heard
oh this is gonna strike a raw nerve mama
heres the platters
the wolfman howls and the platters wail into the great pretender
curt sings along mouthing the words
then somebody walks in front of curt
curt pays no attention then sense the presence of another guy
soon he realizes that he is being surrounded by a group of three hoods
they slink up from all sides wearing car coats with the name pharoahs embroidered across the back
curt looks them over they all watch the silent tvs
one of them without turning talks to curt
whadaya doin creep
no im talking to the other fifty creeps here
you know gil gonzales
dont know gil
you really should
hes a friend of ours
and thats his car youre sitting on
curt looks uneasy and slides quietly off the de soto
curt sticks his hands in his pockets and starts slowly down the sidewalk
hey where ya goin
turning no place
not going any place
ya must be going someplace i mean ya left here
bring him over here ants i want to show him something
ants a tall ghoulish looking kid who probably got his name from the scar across his face which has recently been stitched to look like a party of ants marching
across his cheek brings curt back gently
joe is bent over looking across the hood of the de soto
here bend down look here
right across there see
i guess so yeah
joe unbends and lightly punches curt on the shoulder
you scratched it man
where do you get off sitting on gils car huh man
joe gives him another charming punch on the shoulder
the others have left the tvs and are watching curt now looking puzzled and pained at the scratch on the car
its not much of a scratch
i dont think hell even it aint the size thats in question here
its the principle
jeez this is tough
what should we do with ya
tie him to the car and drag him
curt turns and laughs at ants suggestion
he laughs and laughs until he realizes nobody else is they are pondering the suggestion
thats funny clearing his throat hey you guys know toby juarez
hes a pharoah isnt he
yeah sure we know toby
hes a friend of mine
they all grin and laugh with curt who feels better
sure good old toby
hes a friend of yours
we all hate his guts
curt stops smiling again
oh well i dont know him that much anyway
we killed him last night
tied him to a car and dragged him
curt looks at them both praying theyre kidding
joe looks at him shaking his head
this is going to take some thinking
you better come with us maybe
putting his arm around curt go riding with the pharoahs
well i dont think i can i gotta i know just how ya feel
joe leads curt gently but forcibly toward an incredible maroon merc thats been lowered and chopped so that the windows are like ominous slits and the whole machine has a
joe opens the door and curt slides into the white fluffy interior
in the small back window a metal plaque reads pharoahs
the third member of the gang is carlos a short little kid about fifteen years old
he appears tougher than the rest with a cigarette dangling from his mouth
joe heads for the drivers side and ants and carlos both go for the front passenger door
no i called it
before we picked you up
you cant call it for the whole night man
i got it now
get in the back
carlos gives ants a hard look and ants backs down and climbs in the back with curt
the pharoahs mercury roars out from the curb
the radio blares aint that a shame
as curt sits in the back seat of the car looking very nervous
he eyes the three hoods cautiously
they are sitting super low their eyes just visible over the windows
then curt happens to look around
he does a double take
through the narrow window he sees the thunderbird passing in the opposite direction
curt swivels and watches through the back window as the t bird disappears around a corner
then he shakes his head
of all the times to be trapped with the pharoahs
on the radio the wolfman is giving a phone operator a bad time and the pharoahs are chuckling
as the wolfman continues on the radio the cars pass though the night like a metallic ballet
the pharoahs mercury with curt aboard passes lauries edsel
inside the edsel steve is driving
he puts his arm around laurie and she leans her head on his shoulder
as the edsel cruises by in one direction john milners ford coupe rumbles by on the other side of the street
carol is laughing like mad as the wolfman continues
even john has to chuckle at the mad d
s raspy patter
who is this on the wolfman telephone
your name is colette
your name is colette call
sir this is the operator
are you french operator
this is a collect call for wolfman jack
i love you operator
is this wolfman jack
is floyd there
its for a wolfman
carol looks over at john and shakes her head
i just love listening to the wolfman
my mom wont let me at home
because hes a negro i think
anyway hes terrific
do you know that he just broadcasts from a plane that flies around in circles all the time
do you think thats true
terry drives on through the wonderful night a blonde sitting next to him hes feeling very bitchin
he and debbie are also mesmerized by the wolfman
floyd i love you floyd
is this you floyd
i cannot look on thee love took my hand
and smiling did reply who made the eyes but i
floyd reach out and touch my soul
even curt has to laugh at the wolfman despite his situation
little carlos sits in the front seat and looks over at joe whos driving
your partys ready sir
you mean floyd
hello is this floyd
hello is this matilda
no it aint honey bye
you tell her wolfman
hes my man
when i graduate im gonna be a wolfman
hey you know he broadcasts out of mexico someplace
no he dont
i seen the station right outside of town
thats just a clearing station man
so he can fool the cops
he blasts that thing all the way around the world
its against the law man
in the back seat ants nods in agreement
ah man theyll never catch the wolfman
then ants nose starts twitching and he looks over at curt suspiciously
hey man who cut the cheese
curt tries to smile but looks pretty guilty
then joe looks around from the front seat
he who smelt it dealt it
looking at curt in the back hey creep scoot down
sitting up like that it wrecks the lines of the car you know what i mean
curt scoots down to a level even with ants
ants is staring at him and grinning evilly
then they hear an incredible roar and they all turn to see bob falfas black chevy pass by
falfa has a new girl with him this time a lovely redhead
theres that badass chevy again
look at he snatch hes got with him
hey man he looks like a whimp
curt nods and tries to join in
whimps get all the snatch
carlos and ants look at him
like nobody asked him to open his mouth
milner aint gonna beat that
his time has come
hes getting old
he aint as fast as he used to be
milner may not be as fast a he used to be and having a little teeny bopper with him isnt helping matters
he looks over at carol
shes moved closer to him
you got two seconds to get your ass over in the corner
dont worry i wont rape you
carol slides back to her side
but as they glide along carol watches john
shes moon eyed and flipped over him
john deftly down shifts as he approaches a light and then accelerates through the gears with a race expertise
theres a honk and john and carol look over to see a cadillac full of girls laughing at them
you got a bitchin car
john nods modestly
in fact were gonna give you our special prize for having the neatest car around
you want me to give it to you
if the prize is you honey im a ready teddy
yeah well get bent turkey
the girl suddenly launches a water balloon which john ducks deftly the tumescent missile catching carol full in the face
the girls roar off
john cracks up as carol blinks away the water not believing whats happened
she wipes her face
all right very funny
what a chop
john tries to control himself but cant
lets catch em at the light
then you jump out and flatten their tires
hey wait a just do what i say
carol jumps out of the car as john stops the car in the right hand lane next to the cadillac
as chuck berry wails johnny b
goode they go into action
the girls in the cadillac recognize john as one of their victims and quickly roll up all windows and lock their doors
john starts pulling the stems from the front tires sinking the car
carol starts around the car with the shaving cream spraying all their windows with the foamy lather
carol is having a great time and john is laughing as they continue their guerrilla attack
they finish and jump back in the coupe
the light turns green and john takes off leaving the cadillac stranded at the intersection covered with shaving cream
traffic begins to back up
horns begin to honk
the crickets chirp under the full moon
we hear i only have eyes for you playing as the chevy slowly comes to a stop in an isolated spot along the irrigation canal
terry gets out of the car pops the top off two cokes and pours half of them into the canal
he hums refilling them with bourbon
he goes back to the car
tootie fruiti all ruti
its super cola
he hands her one of the bottles and takes a long drink out of the other
he grabs the steering wheel for support and his eyes begin to water
strong i think
drinking its the living end
terry takes a smaller sip this time
yeaah i guess it wasnt mixed
wow its pretty tonight
its a perfect night to go horseback riding i was going with a guy once who had a horse
i used to have a couple of horses myself
i used them for hunting
i do a lot of hunting
deer mostly although i got a couple of bear last year
yep they were good ponies hunting ponies
i had to train em special you know
do you still have em
we could go for a ride
no i had to sell em
to get these wheels
and a jeep
i also have a jeep pick up with four wheel drive
its got a gun rack
and i use that for hunting mostly
why do you kill little animals
i think thats terrible
oh well yeah i figure with bears though its either me or them
you know i think youre really neat
he suddenly grabs at her putting his arms around her
shes caught off guard and tries to move away
wait a second
terry immediately lets go of her
oh jeez im sorry
i dont know what got into me i didnt mean to maybe its the booze or something
she puts her coke on the floor
she unfastens the chain holding her sweater together and takes it off
suddenly she grabs him and pulls him down on top of herself
she kisses him madly
at first hes surprised but then gets the hang of it
they begin to neck passionately encountering many obstacles in the cramped front seat
ow you pinched me
let me get my head over here okay now you get up ow my leg my leg
ow watch it
ummm i just love tuck n roll upholstery
as they roll around a couple of guys walk by the car laughing
terry manages to sit up and watches them go off into the night
geez its like grand central station around here
why dont we go someplace else
debbie pulls him back down on top of her
nah come on
they wont come back
wait a minute
i got a blanket in the back
why dont we go over into the field
they both get out of the car
terry gets the blanket out of the trunk
they walk along a path next to the moonlit canal
debbie carries their drinks for them
they left the radio on and wolfmans voice can be heard as he takes another call
how old are you
im thirteen how old are you
im only fourteen
oh boy i love you wolfman
singing over wolfman jack
oh now we gonna do the weather for all the valleys and the mountain tops
gonna be hot
about degrees in merced degrees out in fresno and i know were gonna have about degrees up around the valley somewhere
you got the wolfman jack show
as the silhouettes yip yip yip yip into get a job we see the mysterious white thunderbirds cruise by and disappear
the pharoahs mercury turns into the parking lot of a a miniature golf course
the doors open and the pharoahs exit
theres a pause then ants reaches into the car and pulls curt out also
the pharoahs saunter into the miniature golf compound
hey terrific i love miniature golf
i hate it
well i dont play that often really
ah whatre we doing here then
were outta gas
they dont sell gas here
but were outta money too
come on carl
joe gives curt a gentle push and they go inside
the golf course is empty except for a couple of ugly girls putting around in the far corner
under a trellis curt and joe enter as the pharoahs fool around with the candy machine pinball games check your weight and air corps gunner games pretending to play with
joe looks around whistling again
all right men
quickly the pharoahs go into action jimmying locks pounding coin returns pulling out plugs prying open change boxes and stuffing looses coins into their pockets
joe smiles at curt who looks sick again involved now in a robbery
ants is sitting in a rocket to the moon ride pounding on it unsuccessfully when suddenly it starts
ants starts bouncing up and down looking dumber than usual
he swears at rocket to the moon under his breath suddenly a screen door slams
the pharoahs turn
a man in an undershirt stands by the get your balls here booth regarding them warily
whatre you punks doing
the pharoahs cant think of anything right away
ants bounces noisily in the rocket to the moon
the pharoahs are all looking to joe for guidance
joe for his part is mumbling
gordon whats up
the man looks at curt surprised
henderson curt henderson
you with these punks
the pharoahs dont know whats happening yet
curt walks over to mr
these are my friends
we were just
gordon looks skeptical then curt smiles at him
jeez you guys had me scared
he laughs nervously
the pharoahs laugh
hey you havent left yet
oh ah no no im not mr
gordon looks puzzled
i mean im not leaving until tomorrow
well listen hank andersons inside
come in and say goodbye
you know hanks the one that brought your name up on the floor of the moose hall
you got the check didnt you
he leads curt toward the screen door
curt looks around at the pharoahs who are slowly starting to work again pilfering the machines
inside the small office curt shakes hands with hank anderson who pats him on the shoulder
we are all proud of you curt
the moose scholarship couldnt have gone to a better boy
and if theres anything we can do let us know
yeah youll stay in touch by letter wont you
theres a knock at the screen and they turn to see joe at the screen door
hey were all done out here

this place is for fun
yes it is

what he said goes for me too
curt and joe go out through the arcade toward the mercury
they start walking faster anxious to get away
joe grins at curt as they climb into the car
yeah you just might make it as a pharoah yet boy
back in the office hank and mr
gordon watch the car pull out
some day hell make a fine moose
steves chevy sits near the canal
the door is open and the radio blares while terry and debbie are off somewhere in the weeds making out
suddenly a beam from a flashlight plays across the trunk
feet approach the car as the light beam moves across the interior and stops on the vacated shoes on the front seat
the light beam continues past the empty bourbon bottle and starts int he direction of the field where terry and debbie are lost in the throes of passionate love
as we follow the light into the field we hear footsteps
as the darkened figure approaches the couple we see the light go out and catch a gleam of silver in the moonlight as a switchblade springs open
terry reacts to the sound
i thought i heard something
she kisses him and he forgets about the noise
the figure retreats back to the chevy where another indistinct figure waits
theyre porking in the weeds
terry and debbie are resting in the field listening to the radio in the distance
a car engine is heard starting up and disappearing down the canal bank
the countryside is very quiet
only crickets and frogs are heard as terry begins to drop off asleep
he suddenly jumps with a start
wait a minute
the radio is gone
that means the car is gone
he scrambles to the spot where the chevy once stood
debbie comes up and watches terry look heavenward
oh god im sorry
but why the car
you could have struck us with lightning or something anything but not the car
cars are seen here and there in the moonlight along the irrigation canal outside of town
in the cars radios are playing to the aisle laughter can be heard in some whispering in others
lauries edsel is parked by the slow moving water
in the front seat of the car steve and laurie are making out
laurie leans back against steve his arms around her and they look out the window at the stars
you know it doesnt make sense to leave home to look for a home to give up a life to find a new life to say goodbye to friends you
love just to find new friends
say that again i didnt thats what curt said
smiling you mustve talked his ear off trying to get him to stay
thats not true
i didnt say anything
curt just said at dinner tonight he realized there was no big hurry
he thought he should take it easy for a while go to j
and try to figure out what he wants to do with his life
that sounds logical
lauries expression changes
you think so
i think curts probably right for curt
not for me though
laurie look at me
now you know what i want out of life
and its just not in this town
im not going to the airport tomorrow
she looks sullen and he smiles a little
he turns her around and gently kisses here
they begin to make out laurie seeming a little desperate
steve pushes her slowly down on the seat
he moves on top of here and his hand begins to wander
quietly its our last night together for three months
weve been through this before
im going to miss you so much
i need something to remember you by
you dont want me to forget you
she closes her eyes trying not to cry
he starts to move on top of her kissing her neck
she struggles for a few moments then goes limp not responding
he pulls away angrily
youre just lying there
well go ahead you want to
not like that
if youre not going to remember me for anything else why dont you go ahead
you want it and you know it
dont be so damn self righteous with me
after those things you told me about watching your brother youre disgusting
get out of my car
i told you never im sorry
its not worth it
i dont care if youre leaving now get out
she reaches past him and pulls the door handle
the door swings open and she shoves steve out
then she starts the engine and drives away leaving steve standing there in the darkness
in the distance he hears the laughter of other couples and the drifting music from their radios
terry and debbie walk slowly along the dark canal
terry takes a large slug of his bourbon and coke
anyway the goat killer lets talk about something else
whenever he strikes he leaves a bloody goats head near the victim
isnt that creepy
terry thinks about it and indeed it is
he looks around into the darkness and then takes debbies hand
they thought he went up to stockton but two nights ago they found carlie johnson and don white right here by the canal all hacked to pieces and who do
you thinkll take the regionals this not only were there bloody goats heads but he had switched all the parts of their bodies around
you know putting her arms on him and his legs on terry is slowing and he stops her
he motions for her to shut up and they listen
the wind whines across the flat valley
ahead there is only darkness then footsteps
wait a second
did you hear
you think its the goat killer
i mean no
listen ill go for help you stay here
terry has turned and is starting off when she grabs him by his shirt tail
come on well hide in the field
she takes terrys hand and they go off behind some bushes away from the black water
debbie looks through the bushes squinting
maybe if its the goat killer hell get somebody and well see the whole thing
terry stands with his eyes closed
i dont want to see the whole thing
especially if its us he oh why me
im going to look lousy with your legs and a goats head and shhh hes stopped
i cant see him very i think hes coming this way
she edges off to get a better view
well as long as hes not debbie
terry starts off taking one step turns takes another turns takes another
suddenly terry hears something behind him
he turns very slowly and looks
a figure is standing right behind him silhouetted by the moon its face obscured
terry jumps about three feet and yells
terry stops yelling seeing that its steve
debbie comes back through the bushes and terry looks at her nervously
whered you go anyway
well dont go off again
come on lets get out of here
terry and debbie start to walk with steve back toward town
terry keeps taking pulls from the bottle of bourbon
whatre you doing out here
hey wheres my rod
choking um oh did i introduce you
this is debbie
debbie this is steve
they continue to walk along the dark canal bank
well what about my car
its in the garage
i put it in the garage for safe keeping
i dont want to take any chances with it
its a good thing too
cause somebody stole our car
what kind was it
gee ah wheres laurie anyway
i guess we broke up
you broke up
steve just shrugs
the three of them go off into the darkness
the coupe makes an eccentric swerve as it cruises along the main drag
inside carol is looking at the gear shift knob that shes taken off the shift arm as they listen to do you want to dance
it doesnt look like a gear shift knob
come on will ya
give it back to me
well go ahead cream me
whats wrong youre a tough guy
break my arm see if i care
he ignores her and finally his silence makes her take a small round knob out of her pocket and put it back on the shifter where it belongs
i was just going to keep it for a little while
youre an ogre just like my father
he wont let me play records or stay out late or anything
worried he ah doesnt like you to stay out late
no hes terrible
once i was at a party that didnt end till late and he called the cops
can you imagine
it was only a little after midnight and he had the whole police force say where do you live anyway
over on ramona why
she suddenly smiles oh no
you thought id tell you where not me not old carol
the night is young and im not hitting the rack until i get a little action
john sighs wondering if hell ever get rid of her
he looks back at something in the rear view mirror
he speeds up and checks the mirror again
what do you keep lookin at
she looks around behind them whos that
you know him
hes following awful close
grab onto something
carol looks scared and grabs onto the dash
john suddenly hits the brakes
the deuce coupe noses down and bob falfas chevy has to swerve abruptly to avoid a crash
falfa pulls the chevy around and alongside the coupe
he has another new girl with him
shouting over sorry if i scared ya man
looking ahead takes more than that to scare me
where ya been hiding
didnt anyone tell ya i been looking for ya
hey i cant keep tracka all the punks lookin for me
they say youre the fastest thing in the valley
but that cant be your car man
that must be your mamas car
hell i feel embarrassed just getting near ya
ya should man youre driving a field car
whats a field car
field cars drive through the fields dropping cow shit all over the place to make the lettuce grow
laughing thats pretty good
hey i like that paint job you got
what they call that sorta a cross between piss yellow and puke green aint it
yeah well youre cars so ugly you must have to sneak up on the pumps to get a tank of gas
well at least i dont have to move over to let a funeral go by man
through all the insults carol has been cracking up
shouting your cars uglier than i am
john and falfa both look at her and she sits back
that didnt come out right
they both stop at a light now
falfa roars his engine
come on boy prove it
look kid why dont you go out and win a few races then come back and see me
oh race him you can beat him
john gives carol a very fierce look and she sinks back into her corner
hey thats a tough lookin girl you got with you man
whatre you doin
trying to pick up a few extra bucks babysitting
grinning at carol hey doll
why dont you come on and ride with me in about ten years
leave her out of this
this is just between you and me
falfa revs his engine again
john thinks a moment then shifts down into first
the light changes and john and falfa take off tires screaming
the two cars perfectly in sync rocket down the block toward the next red light
john starts to slow for the light
falfa looks over laughs and runs the red light
hes really fast isnt he
but hes stupid
curt is still out riding with the pharoahs
he seems a little easier with them now after their successful heist at the miniature golf course
the radio is playing party doll
hey any of you guys know a blonde in a white t bird
yeah i seen her what about it
i was just wondering who she is
shes outta your price range man
my brothers been with her and he clued me in
you mean shes a yeah thirty dollar sheri
can you believe that
we must be thinking of different blondes
hey man dont tell joe what he thinks
thirty dollars aint much
i saw ten thousand once
my old man had it in a suitcase
they caught him the next morning though
fuzz ahead watch it
fuzz ahead watch it
at jerries cherries
you can just barely see the fender
thats rotten man
hiding like that
ants gives him the evil eye
joe watches the cop car in the used car lot as they pass it
we oughta do something
i got an idea
i got a good idea
steve terry and debbie have made it back into town from the canal
they walk past the closed stores and stop on a busy corner
i think im gonna go over to burger city
lauries probably over there
you really think shes got me worried about where she is dont you
let me tell you something
i couldnt care less
want to come along
yeah i do
make up your minds
you know we got to report the car missing
steve goes off and debbie looks at terry
why cant we go to burger city
how can you think of hamburgers when somebody stole my car
she looks hurt and starts off
curt is getting out of the low slung merc and joe saunters around from the drivers side
he smiles friendly like listen ah carl i curt
he nods at curt looking cautiously around the dark lot
despite you scratching gils car i like you
and i know what youd like more than anything right now
like every guy in town you got the same secret dream right
ya want to join the pharoahs
you can admit it youd like to but you never dreamed it could be possible did you
curt shakes his head slowly
well tonight im goin to give you your chance
curt hasnt the slightest idea what joe is talking about
joe puts his arm around curts shoulders and leads him away explaining what he has to do while ants and carlos grin
in the middle of the used car lot a patrol car hides among the autos for sale
inside the car holstein sits with another officer whos dozing
across holsteins dark glasses reflections of the kids cars cruising by can be seen as holstein waits to nab somebody
joe approaches the patrol car through the lot
he ducks carrying a length of metal cable in his hand
curt wanders behind him
joe sees him and motions for him to get down
curt ducks down near joe
now you got it
im stayin here
youre on your own
wait a minute wait a minute joe
what if he hears me
look at it this way now you got three choices
one you chicken out
in that case i let ants tie you to the car and drag you around a little bit
and you dont want that right
two you foul up and holstein hears you and well ah
you dont want that right
no i dont
three you are successful and you join the pharoahs with a carcoat and the blood initiation and all that huh
seeing joe walk away wait wait a minute
wait a minute
what blood initiation
oh here we go baby
heres come go with me
the policeman waits for a victim
in the background we see curt dodging from behind one car to another
taking cover curt makes another break toward a car and trips and falls
in the cop car holstein thinks he hears something
he opens the door and gets out
adjusting his billy club he paces around the used car lot officiously while curt hides behind a falcon and peeks out from behind a fender
he sees holstein walking back toward the squad car
the cop opens the door again and climbs in
the echoing sound of the calls coming over the police radio blend with the wolfmans howling as cars pass with their radios blaring
curt is inching forward with the cable toward the squad car
in the background a slow freight train can be heard starting to move across the valley
curt ties the cable to a post and then looking scared crawls under the police car with the cable
underneath the car curt inches on his back and then reaches up and attaches the cable to the rear axle of the car
terry and debbie are walking across the street terry looks miserable and disconsolate about the loss of the chevy he possessed for three short hours
debbie tries to be more positive about the situation
hey why dont we go get your jeep
what are you talking about
you know your jeep
the one you sold the hunting ponies for
the one with the four wheel drive
terry just stares at her morosely
he stops by a parking meter and sinks down on top of it
come on terry terry
curt and joe are on the run toward the merc
ants and carlos jump in as they start their getaway
hey you sure you got enough slack
lets get out of here
joe shifts into high gear and is flying down the main drag
terry and debbie look startled as they see the pharoahs mercury roaring by and curt leaning out the door shouting insanely
stand by for justice
terry and debbie watch the merc speed suicidally past jerrys cherries used car lot
holstein spots them and the driver starts up the engine of the squad car
the red lights start flashing and the siren wails
the patrol car shifts into gear and leaps forward
suddenly theres a horrendous metallic screech the patrol car hurtles up and out airborne for a moment then noses down and bounces along the pavement sending out sparks as it
slides to a stop
the driver is stunned and frozen to the wheel
holstein manages to remove his dark glasses and looks back
there sitting quietly in the middle of the parking lot is their trans axle and two rear wheels
the patrol car sits on the ground at a twenty degree angle while its engine whines impotently at top speed
on the radio the all seeing wolfman gives an evil laugh oh i cant believe it
feels so good cause youre sweet sixteen
and johnny burnette takes his cue and croons into youre sixteen
john has glided off the main drag and into a residential area
everything is dark and quiet as the adult population sleeps through the night
john pulls the coupe to the curb and turns off the engine
he turns out the lights
inside the car theres silence
only the clock ticking
carol looks over at john a little nervously
why are we stopping here
john looks at her and his arm slides along the back of the seat above her
she notices his arm and the fact that hes moving slowly toward her
in a husky voice carol
i i dont think that i can control myself any longer
carol ive got to have you
he touches her hair and she slouches back into her corner fearfully
all night youve been sitting there and youve been so sexy and its been so hot and i cant wait any more
well well a lot of thats an act you know
like my crying
it was just an act
well its been building up inside of me like a volcano all night
maybe if i knew where you lived i could fight it i could take you home but since you wont tell me and since here we are ive got to
its too late its not too late
its never too late
ramona two three one smiling two three one ill show you
its easy to find
john starts the car engine
carol looks very relieved
the yellow deuce coupe roars off down the dark street
steve sits in the almost empty cafe section of burger city
he stirs a coffee and mulls over the nights events in his mind
a door opens and budda macrae comes in
she watches him a moment then takes off her little bell boy cap and gets a cup of coffee for herself
steve looks up as she comes over on her roller skates
you mind if i sit down
no have a seat
i got five minutes outa the rat race and i saw you all alone
for a change
she drinks her coffee and he looks out the window thinking about something else
i dont know
i thought the two of youd be going strong this being your last night and everything we broke up
budda looks surprised
no big deal
we were out at the canal and
we had a fight
budda smiles and he looks at her strangely
whats so funny
a girl like laurie i mean she goes to school and is cute and popular and all but were not so different
we know what we want
ive seen her after you for two years now
shes not like that
she does have a different approach
hers is never surrender me i lay down my arms at the drop of a hat budda you got an hour left lets get on it
yelling back all right relax
listen im off in an hour
if you wanta come over my girlfriends away for the weekend
i dont know
laurie walks up the drive in and is about to enter when she stops and watches steve and budda
she thinks about going in then hesitates watching them
why dont you
i never got a chance to talk to you
youre leaving tomorrow
listen i gave up a long time ago so itd be just for fun
she smiles at him and he smiles back a little
at the door laurie turns and leaves before steven sees her
ill see ya later then
she gets up and goes back to the counter on her skates
steve thinks a moment and gets up also
budda budda wait
she turns and he comes over to her as she puts back on her little cap
i gotta get up early and i just dont think itd work out
shes got you so brainwashed well hell
some day im gonna win
dont ya think
she smiles briefly then turns and leaves
steve watches her go
the drive in remains a raucous roar cars coming in from the hop from the movies other cars going out to the canal or back out to cruise
only the car hops who have developed a late hour harried look suggest its nearly closing time
the pharoahs arrive
the mercury swings imperiously into the lot
the radio can be heard as the rumbling engine dies
the clovers are singing love potion
curt jumps out of the mercury elated
the pharoahs all climb out and circle him punching him playfully
joe holds him while carlos tickles him and they all laugh
oh mother its been a glorious night
that was the bitchinest thing i ever seen in my whole life
i seen a little kid attacked by pigs once but this was even better
oh boy ill tell you something that car mustve jumped five feet in the air
curt nods feeling pretty good
you sure you got to go
the nights young
yeah theres some things i got to do
i still want to find that blonde
i think she was an optical delusion man
psychology wise it aint good to dwell on it
youll alter your ego or something
anyway catch ya tomorrow night
yeah i guess so
man we dont admit a lot of guys to the pharoahs
you understand were going to have to swipe your jacket and all you gotta make up your mind
curt nods thinking about it
then he shrugs
he looks at the three pharoahs as they climb back into their maroon chariot
hey ill see you guys
sure listen remember rome wasnt buried in a night
joe laughs and curt nods
he watches the mercury pull out and then he wanders back across the drive in toward his little citroen
my my my
you only got five minutes left if you want to talk to the wolfman
gonna make all your dreams come true baby
curt gets into the little car and sits listening to the radio
the neon mels drive in is reflected across the windshield
would you dedicate a record to keep me and my girlfriend together
are you separated
well see were havin a little problem
ill bring you right together
hold on a minute man
hi ya hi ya hi hi hi
everythings gonna be all right now man you understand
now let me play the record for you
as the wolfman talks on curt glances toward the street
he sees the white thunderbird gliding by
he sits up quickly and tries to start the citroen but the machine barely turns over
he keeps trying desperately but the engine wont catch
laurie drives slowly alone in the edsel
on the radio the skyliners are lamenting the sad state of things since i dont have you
laurie wipes her eyes crying with the music
a horn honks
she looks over to see bob falfas car pacing her
hes alone now and grinning at her
laurie ignores him
they drive along further
falfa roars his engine but she still doesnt give him any attention
he gives up and pulls off
laurie thinks a while pouting
she pulls alongside falfa at the next light
he isnt looking at her
she toots her horn and he turns
laurie motions him to pull over
falfa looks surprised
the light changes and he follows her to the curb
laurie takes a deep breath and with a determined look gets out and walks back to his car
she gets in and closes the door
they start off
he looks over and smiles
hey hey hey baby what do you say
just dont say anything and well get along fine
falfa is puzzled by the frigidity in the air
he glances at her then back at the road wondering about this strange chick
the coupe slows in front of a modest california ranch style home
john stops the car and turns off the engine
he looks over at carol who seems lost in thought
this the first time youve been quiet all night
i had fun
she sits for a moment about to say something
do you like me
i like you
youre all right
but i mean do you like me
i like you
couldnt i have something to remember you by
john gives in to her sweet gaze
he takes off the gearshift knob gives it to her and leans over and gives her a kiss
its just like a ring or something
its like we were going steady
waitll i tell marcia
wait a minute now
waitll i tell everybody
dont go overboard with this thing
well ill see you around
she jumps out of the car and runs up the walk to the house
he watches her stop at the screen door and turn
she gives him a little wave then goes inside
john looks over at the empty seat next to him and seems a little sad
he starts the engine and drives off slowly
i havent cried so much
and the tears and everything man
i leaned down towards the microphone and i almost shorted myself out
curt has the font hood up on the beetle like citroen and is fooling with the recalcitrant engine
steve is standing beside him
hold that up
taking the hood from him ive been thinking maybe youre right
why should i leave home to find a new home
why should i leave friends that i love to find new friends
wait a minute wait a minute
ive heard this already
arent you the one who for eight weeks has been telling me you have to leave the nest sometime
i realize that
i realize no no realizing
youve been telling me all summer that its time to pull your head out of the sand and take a look at the big beautiful world out there
gimme this thing
letting him close the hood i dont know i banging the citroen hood shut i feel like a mid wife
i guess i was wrong
i may have been wrong
youve been talking about getting out of this town for eight weeks
and now goddamnit
youre just youre just mentally playing with yourself
if you can just relax well talk about it at the airport
curt walks around the side of the car and opens the door
where are you going
its awfully early in the morning
i have a dental appointment
come on curt
just relax wil ya
ill see you at the airport
curt gets into the car and starts the engine
steve watches him pull out of the drive in then walks off
a half dozen people are standing around in the parking lot behind the bar
debbie is sitting on the hood of a car swinging her legs and chewing gum
the people all seem to be watching something on the ground behind the car
coughing is heard then gagging and the unmistakable sounds of someone being sick
at the back door of the bar even the cooks are looking and pointing
we hear more coughing and vomiting
a guy slides up on the hood next to debbie
i never seen a guy lose so much
he mustnt have been used to drinking
oh no he really likes to drink
he told me
an old man looks at his watch and then up at the stars
i knew a man once who got this sick
that was ten years ago
what do you think that was there that he had for dinner
more groaning and gaggin is heard
an old woman moves close to the old man and he puts an arm around her sentimentally
staying on his hands and knees like that
she grins he looks like a dog doesnt he
looks like old ginger
sicker than a dog thats for sure
the people drift off leaving debbie sitting alone on the car
now terry slowly emerges pulling himself up the hood of the car
his face is white
he lies across the hood trying to catch his breath
ohh rats i feel like he notices a car nearby and pushes himself up wait a second
he staggers across the lot toward steves chevy
debbie slides off the car and follows him
its oh my god it looks like steves car
look right here under our its my car
we found it
terry staggers around and looks for the keys
he searches under the front seat and over the visor
mustve taken the keys with them
maybe we oughta call the police
never get here in time
i got a better idea
well just steal it back
see if you can find some wire around
we only need a foot to hot wire it
john pulls the coupe out of the garage and wheels up to the pumps of the gas station
an attendant nods looking at the roaring engine
took the header plugs off
expectin some action
john looks at him from inside the coupe and nods slowly
theres some punk lookin for me
why the hell do they bother
youve been number one as long as i can remember
its been a long time aint it
ill see ya
john drives the car out of the station and screeches down the street
terry is fiddling around under the dashboard trying to hot wire the chevy
as the wires connect the radio comes to life and the wolfman growls
who is this on the wolfman telephone
theres the sound of a phone ringing then the unmistakable voice of the big bopper answering
hellooo baaaby just then terry looks up and sees one large badass looking at him
terry gets up slowly and sees another big guy standing nearby
the first badass reaches in and grabs terry by the shirt
he pulls him from the car
terry is smiling weakly
ah hi this is my car
what i mean is somebody stole my car i mean i lost my car and i want to thank you two guys for the first badass shoves terry toward the
for returning i mean finding it
i mean listen now listen guys ive been sick recently and this kind of activity can really be hard on a guy
now easy will you
they throw him back and forth and start to rough him up seriously
debbie is running around helplessly while they pummel terry
then she sees the yellow deuce coupe passing
john glances out his window and notices the fight behind the come on inn
he punches it and wheels into a fast u turn
the hoods have quit playing with terry and are punching him
terrys still on his feet mostly because hes drunk and staggering away from a lot of the blows also debbie is screaming and pelting the assailants with her purse
stop it stop it stop it
john jumps out of the coupe and runs into the parking lot
he grabs one of the punks and turns him smashing him in the face
the punk lands on his ass
john starts circling the other
a good fighter john lands a couple of blows to the gut and lands him on his can
both of them crawl off
terry is lying nearby drunk sick and bloodied
debbie holds his head in her lap
john goes over and kneels by them
hey man you all right
ill die soon and itll all be over
looking at john wow youre just like the lone ranger
eyeing debbie yeah
listen are you with the toad or were you with them
terry manages to raise his head
youre talking to the woman i love
his head falls back again
what happened man
terry opens his mouth to start to explain but its too hard
he can only moan
the drive in is emptying out finally as the midnight hour approaches and passes
the die hards and the hard ups are still wheeling through mels looking for remains of any action
steve sits inside in a booth
two gossipy looking girls come in smiling and slide into the booth across from him
hi karen judy
have you seen laurie lately
steve shakes his head no
well we have
already annoyed oh yeah
she was just with a really cute guy in a boss car
we wondered who he was
i wouldnt know
his names bob falfa
the name registers with steve
terry and debbie pull into the drive in and park
terry his face swelling groans as he leans toward the intercom
i mean i want two cherry cokes with lots of ice
never mind forget the cokes just bring the ice pronto
the intercom repeats his order in a foreign language and suddenly steve arrives and opens the door
i need the car now
terry gets out and debbie gets out her side
steve gets in
whats going on
im about to find out
steve roars out of the drive in leaving terry and debbie standing in an empty space
i dont believe it
you practically get killed trying to get your car back then you let him have it
terry looks at her his eye swollen his lip ballooning his glasses broken
finally he gives up its not worth the trouble any longer
its not my car
well where is your car
terry is upset now
you dont no car at all
what about your jeep
terry shakes his head
well how am i going to get home
just then the car hop approaches with the two cokes on two trays
wheres your car
i gotta hook em to your car
terry shrugs standing in the empty stall the carhop with the trays and debbie watching
theres a low rumbling sound and the girls turn as johns deuce coupe glides into the stall next to them
terry shuffles toward johns car a defeated man
terry leans against johns car and john looks out the window at him
whats wrong toad
you lose the car again
steve took it
its a shame baby
ill tell yuh
got to take it easy when youre drivin that car of yours
you got to cruise easy baby
dont be doin any accidents or anything on me
and the radio plays cryin in the chapel
john smiles and gets out of the car
he goes and opens his hood making a last minute check on something
terry sits down gently on a curb by john
debbie has been talking with some other boys
eventually she wanders up slowly and looks at terry
he looks up at her then away disgraced and embarrassed
she sits down by him and theyre silent
you know i had a pretty good time tonight
oh come on youre just no no really
i really had a good time
i mean you picked me up and we got some hard stuff and saw a hold up and then we went to the canal you got your car stolen and
then i got to watch you gettin sick and then you got in this really bitchin fight

terry looks at her starting to regain a little cool
you think so
yeah well i guess i have pretty much fun every night
anyway if youre not doing anything tomorrow night why dont you come over
yeah well i might be busy you know
but we could well i got a little vespa i just play around with
why thats almost a motorcycle
and i just love motorcycles
he feels his swollen lip and she touches it
then she leans over and kisses him
i got to go
she smiles walks off swinging her purse
she looks over her shoulder and smiles
he smiles back
the little citroen bumps along a lonely dirt road winding its way through dark peach orchards and wizened grape vineyards
curt watches the deserted landscape when suddenly the radio increases in volume and he turns it down
then it begins to roar and distort eerily as the signal becomes more powerful
then curt sees it
he stops the car and gets out
he stands looking at an isolated white frame house hitting in the moonlight
curt looks up at a spidery radio antenna that rises toward the stars its black wires humming in the stillness
curt starts up the gravel walk to the door
under the glare of a naked spotlight he sees a small intercom which plays soft rock and roll
he hesitates then pushes a buzzer
he pushes it again and finally a voice comes over the intercom
yeah who is it
its i want to talk to the wolfman
the wolfman aint here
i know but i got to get in touch with him
i got something to give him before we dont take no deliveries after eight
come back tomorrow
no i cant
i want to ask him something that dedications by phone is diamond
wolfman top is box chula vista
wolfman sweatshirts is wolf enterprises bakersfield
listen i got a right to talk to him
i listened to him every night for as long for twelve years almost
i know him and its personal and itll only take a minute and i bet wolfman would be upset if he knew a friend couldnt get in touch with a
buzzer interrupts him and the door opens an inch
curt pushes it open slowly no one is there
a little scared he goes inside and closes the door
curt walks slowly down a dark eerie corridor passing strangely lit rooms with electronic generators humming dynamos and glassed off booths filled with flashing electronic apparatus
curt goes through this other worldly maze until he comes to a small dimly lit control booth
a figure inside is barely visible through the reflections in the double glass windows
the figure turns and walks up to the window
curt backs off a bit
a face stares at him long hair greased in a ducktail a short chinbeard
then he speaks his voice filtering strangely through a hidden speaker
what do you want
through the window curt can be seen but no sound is heard
pull the red switch
im looking for a girl
arent we all
she aint here
come on back to the booth
curt walks around through a few more glass doors and ends up in the booth with the manager
the manager sits down and leans back turning a fan to blow on his large chest
hes a large friendly looking man he wears a hawaiian shirt
he sucks on a popsicle
curt stands awkwardly
hey have a popsicle
the ice box just broke down and theyre meltin all over the place
you want one
have a popsicle
are you the wolfman
im not the wolfman
the manager leans forward and picks up a spool of tape
he holds it up as a magician would for audience inspection then puts it on a machine
a record is about to end
as it does the manager punches some buttons and the record segues into a wolfman howl and then the distinctive wolfman voice takes over
the manager adjusts the monitor volume down and sucks his popsicle
who is this on the wolfmans telephone
howre you doin diane
the station manager smiles at curt who is watching the tape and blinking lights of the large console
thats the wolfman
hes on tape
the man is on tape
do you love me
say you love me diane
well ah where does he work
i mean where is the wolfman now
the wolfman is everywhere
but i got to give him this note
taking it from curt here let me see the note
he reads it hell thats just a dedication
all i gotta do is relay it
and itll be on the air tomorrow or tuesday at the latest
see this is very important
i may be leaving town tomorrow and its very important that i damn it that i reach this girl right now
you dont know whether youre gonna leave town or not
well im supposed to go to college back east tomorrow
and i dont know if im gonna go
wait a minute
have a popsicle
no thank you
sit down a minute
curt sits down undecided about leaving and upset about not being able to get in touch with the lovely creature he saw earlier that night
listen its early in the morning
now i cant really talk for the wolfman
but i think if he was here hed tell you to get your ass in gear
now no offense to your home town here but this place aint exactly the hub of the universe if you know what i mean
and well ill tell you this much the wolfman does come in here now and then with tapes to check up on me you know and when i hear the
stories he got about the places he goes
hell here i sit while theres a big beautiful world out there dont ya know
wolfman comes in last time talking about some exotic jungle country handing me cigars he says was rolled on the naked thighs of brown beauties
the wolfman been everywhere and he seen everything
he got so many stories so many memories
and here i sit sucking on popsicles
curt looks at him a moment
why dont you leave
well im no kid anymore
i been here a long time
and the wolfman well the wolfman gave me my start and hes sorta become my life
i cant leave him now
gotta be loyal to the wolfman you understand
curt nods and stands
the manager swivels around and punches some buttons putting on a commercial
he turns back
i tell you what
if i can possibly do it tonight ill try to relay this dedication and get it on the air for you later on
thatd be great
he shakes the managers hand then wipes it on his pants
sorry sticky little mothers aint they
curt goes out the door
he starts back out through the maze of windows and electronic machines
echoing throughout the rooms the wolfmans raucous voice follows curt
the wolfman howls and curt turns
through the maze of glass shifting like prisms he sees the station manager sitting by the mike howling
then he laughs and howls again starting to sing a song called bluebirds on my dingaling pounding out the rhythm on the console
he backs away leaving the wolfman whos on his feet now screaming out the end of the song dancing by himself in the little glass room from which his voice
radiates out through the night and around the world
john is working under the hood of the deuce coupe when falfas chevy drives into the parking lot
the radio is now blasting heart and soul
terry moves over toward johns car
john doesnt look up although he is quite aware of falfas entrance
falfa slows down in front of johns car and revs his engine again
john looks up laurie is in the car with falfa
she looks determined not to seem as scared as she really is
hey john let me go with you
i cant take you when im racin somebody
ah come on
just let me go
so i can watch
or ill flag you okay
terry starts to climb into the car
john looks over at falfa in the rumbling chevy
falfa grins and gooses the chevy peeling out of mels drive in
falfa looks over at laurie who is watching the road nervously
all right now wheres this paradise road
you just follow this street straight out of town
listen if youre gonna race john milner you can let me out right when we get there
why dont you shut up baby
you aint said one word all night long
what a weird broad
but youre gonna appreciate me soon
youre gonna be hangin on for mercy when i get this sucker rollin
he accelerates the chevy shifting up deftly
laurie looks scared now
steve is cruising along the almost deserted streets looking for laurie
a t roadster pulls up alongside and a guy shouts at steve
you heading out to paradise road
paradise road im not some guy named falfa going up against milner
johns racing falfa
figured something was up saw them going out of town real cautious and then but steve is gone
dale looks surprised as the chevy roars off toward paradise road
curt pulls into the parking lot just as the neon sign goes out
the last cars are leaving as the drive in shutters up for the night
curt stops next to the lighted phone booth and sits in his car listening to the wolfman
i got a dedication here thats for a friend of the wolfman a special friend of the wolfman whos leaving town tomorrow and wants me to play the next song
for a blonde young lady in a thunderbird
a white t bird you understand
now my friends named curt and he wants to talk to you out there baby
so you meet him at burger city or phone diamond
now hes a friend of mine you hear and little girl you better call him or the wolfman gonna get you
the wolfman howls and curt smiles leaning his chin on his hand looking around the dark drive in wondering about tomorrow
johns yellow deuce coupe and falfas black chevy are waiting side by side on a long straight country road their front wheels resting on a weather beaten starting line
the sky is getting lighter as the radio plays green onions
there are about six to eight other cars parked off the road to watch the race
everything is quiet now only the crickets ignoring the solemnity of the scene and still singing
terry jumps out of johns car john hands him the flashlight and he takes up a position in front of the two cars
john looks over at falfa whos arguing with laurie
hey laurie what in the hell are you doing in there
is she gonna ride with you
mind your own business john
yeah shes with me
you worry about yourself man
john settles back in the drivers seat and positions his hand on the gear shift which we see is wrapped with rags because of the missing knob
both drivers start revvin their engines the tension builds
terry looks nervous the engines start to scream and terry his hands shaking on the flashlight manages to flash it on
both cars roar off the starting line tires smoking and screaming
terry has his hands over his head and is coughing in a cloud of smoke as they pass
john beats falfa off the line
out on the road as they hit third gear the cars are almost neck and neck
inside falfas car laurie looks scared to death
falfa looks insane as he tromps it
john hits fourth at about eighty five
falfa does likewise but starts to fish tail
laurie closes her eyes almost crying falfa regains control nervously
falfas engine is winding out incredibly and he begins to get the edge on john
the cars rocket through the dawn light along the flashing white line until suddenly falfas car blows a tire his front wheel slips off and the car shoots off into
a tomato field hits an irrigation ditch and begins flipping over wildly in a horrifying cloud of dust and smoke john sees the chevy leaving the road and screams to a halt swimming through an unbelievable u turn and high tailing it back to the crash site
he is out of the car like a bullet running across the dirty cloddy field
the crash car is beginning to burn in the engine compartment and john is panicked
meanwhile the spectators have arrived including steve who jumps from his car and is running across the field
steve and john arrive at the fire at approximately the same time
they stop the flames are getting higher burning up into the trees now
steve looks around wildly he sees john and goes at him
you stupid sonofabitch she was in that car
why did you have he takes a couple of swings at john who finally manages to tackle him around the waist
they both get up looking at the flaming wreckage
then john moves around the side crouching trying to see past the flames suddenly he stands and motions to steve to come over
they both circle the wreck
around behind the flaming car falfa is standing in a state of shock watching the car go up in smoke while laurie is circling him screaming and beating him with
i said i didnt you lousy greasy jerk
you coulda killed me whats wrong with you
she beats at him crying hysterically
steve runs over and grabs her pulling her away
she fights at steve too not knowing whats going on
no no no
please dont come near me
i think im gonna be sick
standing in the early light steve holds her
she throws her arms around him as the crowd develops along the irrigation ditch to watch the flaming car
oh steven please dont leave me
dont leave me steven
i couldnt bear it
john looks at falfa whos shaking his head watching the car dissolve
come on before she blows
he pulls him off by the neck of the shirt and when theyre a few yards off falfas chevy does blow exploding like a small a bomb blowing it into
back on the road john is heading toward his car its engine still running its door open
terry runs up trotting alongside john like a puppy
jeez did you show him
hell probably never even get in a car again
he was faster
it was beautiful john
just beauti what
john stops by the open door of the deuce coupe
terry stares at him and squints against the rising sun
i was losin man
he had me man
he was pullin away from me just before he crashed
you saw it
no you creamed him from right off the line
the guy never had a chance
the man had me
he was beating me
john i dont know what youre talking about
it was the most beautiful thing ive ever seen
that guy he might as well get a wheelchair and roll himself home
man you got
you got the bitchinist car in the valley
youll always be number one john
youre the greatest
john nods then looks up at terry
his face is glowing his glasses are smashed and his lip is swollen
look at your glasses man
shaking his head okay toad
well take em all
well take em
lets get out of here
john climbs in the car
terry yawns and shakes his head
jesus what a night
he climbs in too and the deuce coupe drives off slowly as the sun rises over the ploughed fields and on the radio we hear only you
curt sleeps in the little car as the sky grows lighter over the empty parking lot
the phone is ringing in the booth
it continues to ring
finally curt becomes aware of it and opens his eyes
it takes him a moment to remember
then panicked he jumps from the car and rushes to the booth
hello hello hello
a soft sexy female voice is on the other end of the line
this is curt who is this
who were you expecting
do you drive a white t bird
i saw you on third street
you know me
who are you
how do you know me
its not important
excitedly its important to me
youre the most perfect beautiful creature ive ever seen and i dont know anything about you

i cruise third street every night
maybe ill see you again tonight
i dont think so
in a couple of hours
where are you from
whats your name
at least tell me your name
wait a second
wait a second
but theres a click as she hangs up
curt looks at the phone a moment then also hangs up
from the car radio he hears the wolfman making kissing noises
little kiss on your ear
good night sweetheart
ill see you later
and then the spaniels duh duh duh duh duh into goodnight sweetheart
a dc prop airliner is warming up its engines as it waits to take off from a small country airport
there arent too many people around
just curt and his friends and family seeing him off
curt stands with a kindly looking couple in their fifties
he hugs his mother and shakes hands with his dad
then curt moves to his friends
he shakes steves hand
yeah same to you
and i better see you there next year
oh yeah ill be there
curt hugs his sister
laurie holds on to him for a moment

bye bye curt
curt goes to terry and john
so long guys
well stay cool man
ah dont do anything i wouldnt do
curt smiles at terry who has a bandage on his forehead
curt looks at john and they dont seem to know what to say
finally john gives curt a little slap on the cheek
ill see ya buddy
i know you probably think youre a big shot goin off like this but youre still a punk
he walks toward the plane and they all wave
he looks around as he goes up the steps carrying a small bag and a portable radio
the stewardess smiles as he passes her
above the door of the plane it reads radar equipped
curt looks back again then goes inside
the plane takes off down the runway and then climbs up into the sky
curt listens to the radio as the plane takes off
its playing goodnight sweetheart
as the plane climbs and banks over the valley the music fades and the station drifts between static and other stations
and then its gone
curt turns off the radio and looks out the window
as the plane banks through the window curt sees the white thunderbird crossing beneath on the small grey ribbon of highway
curt watches it
then the planes shadow ripples over the car and it too is gone
as the plane flies off against the blue sky we see cameos of curt and his friends john milner was killed by a drunk driver in december
terry fields was reported missing in action near an loc in december
steve bolander is an insurance agent in modesto california
curt henderson is a writer living in canada
