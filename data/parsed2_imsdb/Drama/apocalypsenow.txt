inspired by joseph conrads heart of darkness
this draft by francis ford coppola
it is very early in the dawn blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp
a mist clings to the trees
this could be the jungle of a million years ago
our view moves closer through the mist tilting down to the tepid water
a small bubble rises to the surface then another
suddenly but quietly a form begins to emerge a helmet
water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud
printed on a helmet in a psychedelic hand are the words gook killer
the head emerges revealing that the tough looking soldier beneath has exceptionally long hair and beard he has no shirt on only bandoliers of ammunition his body is painted in
an odd camouflage pattern
he looks to the right he looks to the left he looks into camera and slowly sinks back into the swamp disapperaring completely
our view holds we begin to hear natural though unrecognizable jungle sounds far off in the distance
we pan to reveal a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp and part of what seems to be a falstaff beer can in the mud
a hand reaches out and the beer can disappears
as we tilt up we notice that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a m machine gun hand painted in a paisley design
now the view moves away across the ancient growth past the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush wearing an exotic hat made from birds and
across to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever tightening view
their feet boots and sandals leave no impression make no sound
a slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path waiting and watching
the view pushes along with the vietnamese moving faster and faster with them until suddenly directly in front about ten feet away an enormous american clad in rags and bushes
and holding a gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side steps in front of them
he smiles laconically and blasts out five shots that rip through us
by the second shot the whole jungle blazes out with automatic fire
out view turns as the men around us are thrown and torn screaming and scattering into the jungle
more americans appear unexplainably out of the growth
it is now that we fully see the bizarre manner in which they are dressed
some wear helmets others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals
some of them have long savage looking hair other crew cut or completely shaved they wear bandoliers flak jackets shorts and little else
they wear montagnard sandals or no shoes at all and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns
they appear one with the jungle and mist firing into us as they move
the soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp dripping mud his machine gun blasting fire
we begin to move quickly with one vietnamese breathlessly running for his life we move into the jungle with him only to be impaled on a large spear of a
smiling american painted and wearing feathers like an indian
our view falls with him to the ground staring upwards as flame and exploding mud scatter above us
men scream and die around us
the screams amid the gunfire and explosions are piercing and terrible as though the jungle itself is frightened
an american wearing a jungle hat with a large peace sign on it wearing war paint bends toward us reaching down toward us with a large knife preparing to scalp
our view moves away along with the running sandals of a vietnamese soldier moving faster and faster only to be stopped by still another of the savage looking americans with
primitive ornamentation wearing only a loin cloth and green beret
he opens his flame thrower directly on us and the nva soldier and we are incinerated in flame bright psychedelic orange red flame
outrageous loud electric rock music overwhelms the soundtrack the credit titles proceed as the flane consume us growing more intense brighter more vivid purifying transforming into an intense white heat
that we can barely look at like the sun itself
then it explodes breking apart and shattering once again
it begins to cool as the titles continue
it is as though we are moving through the white center of cooling flame forming a spinning web and becoming more distant
the titles continue
we are moving toward planetary nebulae moving through the stars moving closer to the earth
we can barely hear the music now
we move closer to the earth beautiful covered in clouds as though seen from a satellite
the titles continue
we are moving closer to the earth through the soft clouds close enough that we can make out the western hemisphere closer to north america closer to america then california
los angeles still closer to the odd finger like shapes of the view finally settles on a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day
it is large pleasure boat the people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes
they are drinking cocktails and snapping pictures
the boat belongs to the head of a large american corporation and this is his party
this man charlie is sitting his shirt off to catch some of the late sun
others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint
charlie is going on and on its crazy sugar is up to dollars a ton sugar
what about oil
food oil look let me show you something
this is the economy of the united states in two years he takes a newspaper draws a circle
continuing this is west germany
he draws another bigger circle this is japan
another bigger this is italy
a dot this is iran
a very big circle and this is saudi arabia
in two years
a gigantic circle do you understand
whats to prevent it
but ill tell you i didnt build a two billion dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing
we can protect our interests
pause for a drink we are still the most powerful nation in the world
he leans to his associates in a half whisper
continuing you know bodyguard he was a captain in viet nam
you talk to him except he wont talk
this kind of man can kill you with his pinky
a nice quiet fella though
the view begins to pull away from this group
continuing carries a attache case at all times
you know whats in it
another sip an ingram machine pistol
gradually charlies voice softens as we move away and a new voice the voice of someone thinking comes in over it i dont tahe chances and bullshit
you can kill neither should this country
with the ridge of your if were strong we should hand to the throat you protect our interests and can crush a skull with we should have the respect your
but you of the world even if it cant kill anybody with takes another war
the view move along the guests of this small party pictures being taken some people are swimming
it is the good life
now willards voice track dominates
the attache case has been empty for three years but it makes him safe to think theres a machine pistol in it
i dont like automatic weapons
i saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his m to automatic and it jammed
how much money did the contractors make on the m
our view is moving through the people on the boat some reading flirting drinking
continuing he likes to hear stories about nam
i tell him i cant theyre not cleared
the truth is he wouldnt understand
we can now see a man with his back to us looking the opposite way
an attache case resting near to him
we continuing theres no way i can tell them
what really happened over there
i wouldntve believed it if someoned told me
we are now resting on his back
occasionally he sips from a beer but we cannot see his face
continuing there was only one part that mattered for me anyway
i dont even know if i remember all of it
i cant remember how it ended exactly because when it ended i was insane
a saigon boom street in late
there are bars and shops for servicemen the rickshaws the motorbikes
our view moves toward one particular officer b
willard in uniform a captain of the airborne followed by four or five vietnamese kids trying to shine his shoes and sell him things
but i know how it started for me i was on r
in saigon my first time south of the dmz in three months
i wasnt sure but i thought this guy was following me
willard looks back
an american civilian
willard ducks into a bar
not much in this place a bar linoleum flooring a few tables and chairs and a juke box
the lounge is fairly crowded
willard takes off his cap and walks quietly past the soldiers at the bar
some of them catching sight of his ribbons stop talking as he moves by
an infantry captain enters the bar buys a couple of drinks and approaches willards table
how about a drink
he sits down at the table with the drinks
winning the war by yourself
he calls for the waiter part
which part is that
beer with ice and water
thats good gin
im sure it is but i had hepatitis
what unit were you with
the juke box starts blaring
annoyed willard looks over his shoulder
were you longe range recon no i worked too far north for he reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette and the captain leans over the table to light
it for him
willard notices the civilian on the street has glanced in the bar then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway
thats quite an array of ribbons
lets talk about you
i was an fo for the th
thats real fat
at least you always have enough water
how many gallons does each one of those damn things carry
thirty sometimes fifty
you know i can remember once getting back below the dmz and the first americans we ran into were a track squadron
i just couldnt believe how much water they had
wed been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week and before that for two weeks wed been drinking anything rain water river shit stuff right out of the paddies
and there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over
i couldve killed them
solemnly i swear to god i would have too if
i didnt know we had units up there in north vietnam
how long were you up there
a long time
waiter another beer
i go up on missions
listen captain buy me all the beer you want but you better tell that asshole over there youre not going to find out anymore about me
willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the civilian
the civilian is given a sign by the captain
he rises and comes over to the bar
continuing what do you want
indicating the army jeep if youre b
willard th recon group wed like you to come with us
headquarters corps th a
a battalion s com sec intelligence nha trang
who are you
willard looks at the civilian a moment and then walks roght out toward the jeep without saying another word
the civilian follows
a darkly painted huey roars over low paddies and jungle before emerging onto an open plain
it crosses a barbed wire and sand bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily fortified concealed compound
they took me to some place outside nha trang
intelligence headquarters for all operations in south east asia
id worked for intelligence before armed men jump from the huey among them willard
a large camouflaged cover is moved revealing an underground corridor they enter
a door swings wide willard steps through and comes to attention blocking the view of the room
a strange reddish light pervades
the room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke
the whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself and there is a sense of the cut back jungle growth slowly reclaiming it
willard g headquarters reporting as ordered sir
okay willard sit down
willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a bare concrete floor
across from him around steel desks and tables sit several men
the nearest one a colonel puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe behind him sits a major and a seedy looking civilian
have you ever seen this officer before captain willard
he points to the major
this gentleman or myself
i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum is that right
i am not presently disposed to discuss that sir
he turns to the colonel and nods his approval
the colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map
you know much about about special forces green berets captain
ive worked with them on occasions and i saw the movie sir
the officer smiles at this
then you can appreciate commands concern over their shall we say erratic methods of operation
pause i have never favored elite units captain including your paratroopers or whatever
just because a man jumps out of an airplane or wears a silly hat doesnt give him any priviliges in my book not in this mans army
we didnt need em in korea no sir give me an ohio farm boy and an m garand none of this fancy crap no sir
stopping him major
we have special forces a detachments all along the cambodian border
two here and another one here twelve or fourteen americans pretty much on their own they train and motivate montagnard natives pick their own operations
if they need something they call for it and get it within reason
what were concerned with is here
the a detachment at nu mung ba
it was originally a larger base built up along the river in an old cambodian fortress
the area has been relatively quiet for the past two years but captain we know somethings going on up there major the major looks at some papers in front of
communications naturally dwindled with the lack of v
activity this is routine expected
but six months ago communication virtually stopped
about the same time large numbers of montagnards of the mnong descent began leaving the area this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the rhade
tribe that lived in the area for centuries
but what is unusual is that we began to find rhade refugees too in the same sampans as the mnongs
these people arent afraid of v
theyve put up with war for twenty years but something is driving them out
we communicate with the base infrequently
what they call for are air strikes immediate always at night
and we dont know what or who the air strikes are called on
you see no one has really gone into this area and come back alive
walter kurtz lieutenant colonel special forces
we understand you knew him
he puts kurtz dossier in willards hand
hes commanding the detachment at nu mung ba
the colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder flicks it on
the recording is first static the air controller then asks for more information on target coordinates it all sounds very routine military
then a frantic voice comes on talking slurred like someone dumb except very fast
up give it to me quick mark flare affirmative damn immediate receive hearing automatic weapons fire man
gunfire is heard and a lower slower voice in background
blue delta five this big rhine three need that ordinance immediately goddamn give it to me immediate christ big rhino blue god delta damn goddamn
a heavy burst of automatic weapons fire insane laughter static and faintly very faintly we hear hard rock music more static suddenly a low clear voice peaceful and serene almost
tasting the words
this is big rhino six blue delta
thats colonel kurtz
i want that napalm dropped in the trees spread it among the branches
well give you a flare an orange one bright orange
wed also like some white phosporous blue delta
white phosporous give it to me
static interrupts the major turns the machine off
i only met kurtz once
would he remember you
what was your impression of him
you didnt like him
anyone got a cigarette
the major offers him one they wait as he lights up thinks
continuing i thought he was a lame
this is years ago before he joined special forces i guess
we had an argument
i dont know
he was a lame thats all
he couldnt get through a sentence without all these big words about why we kill
well hes killing now
what does that mean
maybe its not kurtz
i dont believe hes capable of that
i just dont believe it
its got to be kurtz
the point is that kurtz or somebody attacked a south vietnamese ranger platoon three days ago
last week a recon helicopter was lost in the area another took heavy damage direct fire from their base camp
our recon flight
you can see of course the implications if any of this even rumours leaked out
you want me to clean it up simple and quiet
exactly youll go up the nung river in a navy p
appear at nu mung ba as if by accident re establish your acquintance with colonel kurtz find out whats happened and why
then terminate his command
terminate with extreme prejudice
a waterway leading out to the ocean it is broken and divided into hundreds of channels islands water farms
a navy patrol boat p
is waiting by a dock area
this is small light craft very fast and heavily armed
its men stand at attention in a small and simple military ceremony
willard approaches them in battle dress tiger suit full field pack forty five helmet m
the boat commander salutes willard
we hear the introductions faintly under willards voice
i met the p
crew they were pretty much all kids except for phillips the chief gunners mate third class l
johnson lance johnson gunners mate third class j
hicks the chef radio operator second class t
miller they called him mr
chief try to keep out of where were going why were goin and whats gonna be the big surprise
all right with me i used to drive a taxi
the chief nods
they all break formation and jump aboard and otherwise go about their work
the twin diesels kick up and t he boat moves away from the dock
the chef jumps aboard lance mans the forward twin fifty caliber machine guns they wave to the guards on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads to
the boat slams through the heavy sea hurtling off the top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another
willard holds on to whatever he can he looks very pale
water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone
the chief mans the wheel and the engines whine
lance climbs back from his position
he looks at willard who just stares ahead into space swallowing
the dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds the sea is calm again
the chief is at the helm willard approaches him
the delta closes off to us about ten miles out of hau fat
well be able to pick up some supplies bit i think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the nung river
its all charlies turf from there on out
were gonna have some help to get in the river
you know these waters chief
bout six months ago i took a man up to lo mung bridge
he was regular army too
shot himself in the head
i brought his body back down
beats me the sun was too much for him or the mud
pause looking at willard
suddenly his attention is diverted there is a slow buffeting as if the air around them is being sucked out and replaced quickly
the boat shakes slightly
there is a distant rolling noise like interrupted thunder
all the men have stopped whatever theyre doing stand up and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills beyond
the buffeting and noise continues they all stand silently suddenly it stops
i hate that every time i hear that noise something terrible happens
anybody see some smoke
too far inland
there they are
he points up to the sky
way up past any clouds and barely discernible we see the black silhouttes of four b bombers their vapor trails streaming white against the dark blue sky
charlie dont ever hear em
not till its too late dont have to hit you neither concussionll do it for a quarter mile or better
burst your ears suck the air outta your lungs
they are looking up
willard sits down unconcerned
he takes out the dossier given him by comsec
he flips through the letters and other documents
the dossier on a detachment had letters from kurtz wife and the wives and families of his men
all asking where to send future mail understanding the necessery silence due to the nature of their work none of the men had written home in half a year
occasionally in the b
we feel the terrifying buffeting of the distant b bombing
studying examining a report
kurtz face evolves through the various stages of his career as represented in the pictures in the dossier as willard reads lieutenant kurtz has shown a dedicated and well disciplined
he is a fine officer combining military efficiency with a broad background in the humanities the arts and sciences
another picture of kurtz in germany standing next to the st petroleum supply group sign
continuing he views his military career as the dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to those darker less fortunate areas in the world
a shot of kurtz at jump school
continuing i feel captain kurtz request for special forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian concerns and his somewhat liberal politics though i can see no
reason to deny it
a close shot of kurtz with green beret on in the vietnam jungle
his face is blank and vacant
continuing we feel major kurtz need to bring a sense of western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be of use in accordance with our vietnamization programs
move in to kurtz empty eyes until the photograph is just a blurred mass of dots
one day later we came to an advanced staging area along the coast
this was our last chance to pick up supplies before approaching the mouth of the nung river
the view of the coastline leading up along the long load ing docks at hau fat an advance staging area for opera tions brute force and mailed fist
everywhere are tents oil drums sandbagged bunkers helicopters tanks guns men
nobody builds advanced staging areas like the americans
as the p
approaches the docking area lance notices something
they look as a chris craft speeds by pulling a fancy water skier who waves as he slaloms by
the men just look at one another
pulls in the men scan the busy surroundings
lance i want you to go with the captain an get three extra drums of fuel and maybe scrounge some more caliber
yeah look at those uniforms
a platoon drills in the hot lazy sun they are clean and pale in contrast to lance and the others just off the airplane
poor bastards have a long year to go
the troops turn and march toward us with six weeks of advanced infantry training to back them up
they are tying up at the dock a young sergeant is fill ing cut papers concerning them and talking with willard
i dont know anything about these papers sir
theyre in order its perfectly clean just check with comsec intel like i said
well you know i dont have the priority to do that sir
it says here not to contact com sec int
whos your commanding officer
right now i am
well who the hell verifies that
he signs it quickly leaving the sergeant totally confused
no shit whats all the activity for around here
the show what show
big show in the parade grounds this noon some boss stuff this bob hope or the like no sir i think thisll be a little bit different wheres it gonna
he points a large well built pedestal has been erected this is surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and garnished with concertina wire
it is empty the entire area around the pedestal and right up to the wire is mobbed with seething american fighting men
some of these boys have just gotten here others have been in the jungle for months
all have one thing in common to see and if possible grab an american girl
their need far surpasses that of the run of the mill rapist pervert or child molester
to counter their need of course are the moat punji stakes and barbed wire but implementing this are seven riot control positions equipped with the lastest in teargas launchers attack
trained german shep herds and assorted psychological warfare aides
even so armed the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire
jammed in the crowd its really too much i mean ive collected every picture of her since she was miss december
yeah you can really get hung up on them like the cat in the delta
one that went up for murder he was an army sergeant
i never heard about that
yeah he really dug his playboy mag man i mean like he was there when it arrived he just knew
so what happened
he was working a
patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole lieutenants anyhow the lieutenant took his new playboy one day sat on the end of the dock and wouldnt give
yeah typical a
then went too far he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold
poking pins in her an all that
sergeant says dont do her like that
you leave your shitty little hands off that girl
gook lieutenant says fuck you in vietnamese sergeant says dont do that again
youll wish you hadnt
then he stood up flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the playboy mag
man it blew him clean off the dock hell just the magazine was floatin there all full of holes
they nail him for it bad
hes in the l
didnt give him no medals or nothing in the b
we begin to hear a swell of two thousand male voices the engines of four helicopters approaching
all heads turn skywards while one descends onto the pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment
on the nose amd doors of the black huey are painted large playboy rabbits
finally the blades are trimmed and a strange silence descends over the men
the door of the copter slides partially open two young green berets step out with m s to varied catcalls
when this abates a young extremelly well dressed man emerges
he is the epitome of a hollywood agent
hair is combed impeccably and free of dandruff clothes are formal but hip shoes are shined quite some dude his presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely quiet the
he walks over to the microphone
id like to say hello from all of us up here to all of you out there
all of you whove worked so hard during operation brute force paratroopers infantry airmen medics marines and sailors
and i want you to know that we feel proud of you and know how hard your job is
to prove it weve brought some entertainment we think youre gonna like the playmate of the year and her two runners up
he pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful sex playmates in fringed go go outfits leap out and start dancing to the creedence clearwater revival singing suzy q
various shots as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic manner smiling
the faces of the g
s pass their jaws drop some look almost horrified
chef is hypnotized mr
chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental tenderness
others grab the air in front of them
with each movement their need increases by the square
they crush forward starting to scream men fall on the wire the guards in the riot control positions forget the attack dogs are trampled
the mob as one surges forward onto the wire
men scream and fall into the moat which is filling up fast
the agent sees this all as he has seen it before
he casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade the girls retreat into the copter he follows then the two green berets
the rotars whine the black playboy huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it
they grab frantically for the wheels but miss
the huey wheels up into the blue sky leaving them all below
such are the ways of war
moving further up the primitive coastline
there are few signs of civilization no villages no boats just the overwhelming presence of the jungle
two days out of hau fat there was nothing but us and the coastline
i felt like i had set off for the center of the earth
suddenly chief looks out ahead
they all turn
chief points up the coast
a thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle
the chief grabs field glasses
yeah fishing village helicopters over there
hueys lots of em
first air cavalry
theyre the ones gonna get us into the river
a vast field of devastation smashed and smoking palm trees deep ragged craters gutted and burning huts shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf
they wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men
overhead jets swoop by firing rockets the noise drowning out willards attempt at conversation with some of the men
we cant hear any of the talk but we notice that the sergeant turns up to a particular huey and points to it
three hueys swoop in low they are heavily laden with machine guns rockets and loudspeakers
the two out side copters hover while the center copter lands raising a lot of dust
it cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side
two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready
then a tall strong looking man emerges
he wears a well cut and neatly stretched tiger suit
it is colonel william kilgore tough looking well tanned with a black mustache
he crouches over holding his hat in the rotor wash
it is no ordinary hat but a l
dodgers baseball hat
he walks out and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle
his eyes are obscured by mirror fronted sunglasses
bellowing lieutenant bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards give me some room to breathe
a lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off
he was not quite prepared for this
turning to his guards bring me some cards
body cards you damn fool cards
the soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic
two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over
they are well tanned and carry no weapons
they seem more casual about the colonel than anyone else
the sergeant walks up leading willard the chief and lance
formally captain b l
willard sir th recon group i carry priority papers from com sec intelligence corp i believe you understand the nature of my mission
not looking up yeah na trang told me to expect you well see what we can do
just stay out of my way till this is done captain
he cracks the plastic wrapping sharply takes out the deck of new cards and fans them
the colonel strides right past willard with no further acknowledgement
the others follow the colonel walks through the shell pocked field of devastation
soldiers gather around smiling as kilgore comes to each v
corpse he drops a playing card on it carefully picking out which card he uses
to himself six a spades eight a hearts isnt one worth a jack in this whole place
the colonel goes on about this business
moving through the corpses dropping the cards
on of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him
the soldier points to lance who immediately puts down the card he was holding
kilgore strides over to the young man who almost instinctively moves closer t willard
continuing whats your name sailor
gunners mate third class l
thats right sir
kilgore smiles sticks out his hand
its an honor to meet you lance
ive admired your nose riding for years i like your cutback too
i think you have the best cutback there is
thank you sir
you can cut out the sir lance im bill kilgore im a goofy foot
his entire top priority mission has been put in the background
this is mike from san diego and johnny from malibu theyre good solid surfers none of us are anywhere near your class though
lance blushes sort of mumbling thanks
my orders are from com sec intel b
willard th recon just hold up a second captain ill get to you soon enough weve got things to do here
willard eats it for now
kilgore puts his hand on lances shoulder and continues flipping the cards in discriminately on the bodies as they talk
continuing we do a lot of surfing around here
like to finish up operations early and fly down to vung tau for the evening glass
have you ever surfed the point at vung tau
i liked the beach breaks around na trang a lot good lefts
he passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five bodies sprinkles cards all over them
continuing we keep three boards in my command huey at all times
you never can tell when youre gonna run into something good
i got a guy in cam rau bay that can predict a swell two days in advance
we try to work it in
he stops at a particularly wild looking viet cong who has died with his mouth agape staring wild eyed in horror at the sky
continuing to himself hell thats an ace if i ever saw one
he puts the card in the gaping mouth
we see the colonel and the others walk off the dead viet cong and card are in the immediate f
the card has the shield of the cav printed bautifully and above it the motto death from above
whereve you been riding lance
i havent surfed since i got here
thats terrible well change that id like to see you work ive always liked your cutback got a hell of a left turn too
willard is sitting with kilgore on acouple of chairs by a table set up in front of the command copter
everywhere we see armed men sandbags barbed wire oil drums etc
hueys are constantly roaring over
artillery booms in the far distance
kilgore looks at the map
why the hell you wanna go up to nu mung ba for
i got bored in saigon
whats the furthest you been in
shit you jump in
whatd you do for supplies
he shrugs mercenaries agents traitors they put out caches
can you trust them
they put out two or three for every one i needed
when you get to the one youll use you just stake it out
if something feels wrong you just pass it up
on one mission i had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars
nu mung ba
last i heard walter kurtz commanded a green beret detachment at nu mung ba
when did you hear
bout a year ago
is kurtz still alive
seems to me he got himself fragged
i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent
maybe a rumor
helluva man remarkable officer
walter kurtz woulda been a general some day
general of the army
shit head of the joint chiefs of staff
did you knew kurtz
i met him
dont you agree
he musta changed
pointing to the map i got to get into the nung river here or here
that village youre pointing at is kinda hairy
i mean its hairy they got some pretty heavy ordnance boy ive lost a few recon ships in there now and again
i heard you had a good bunch of killers here
and i dont intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman nung river
you say you dont know kurtz
i met him
you talk like him
i dont mind taking casualties captain but i like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit ten cong to one
youll find enough cong up there
what about this point here
he puts his finger on the map
continuing whats the name of that goddamn village vin drin dop or lop damn gook names all sound the same
he motions to one of his surfers
continuing mike you know anything about the point at vin drip drop
what do you mean
its really long left slide breaks on the short side of the point catches a south swell
willard looks at lance then at kilgore
why the hell didnt you tell me about that place a good left
to willard there arent any good left slides in this whole shitty country
its all goddamn beach break
its hairy though
thats where we lost mcdonnel they shot the hell out of us
its charlies point
how big it is
six to eight feet
kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters
to himself a six foot left
willard nudges lance who gets the idea
whats the wind like
light off shore really hollow
we could go in tomorrow at dawn theres always off shore wind in the morning
the draft of that river might be too shallow on the point
hell well pick your boat up and lay it down like a baby right where you want it
this is the cav boy airmobile
i can take that point and hold it as long as i like and you can get anywhere you want up that river that suits you captain
hell a six foot left
he turns to an advisor you take a gunship back to division mike take lance with you let him pick out a board and bring me my yater spoon the
i dont know sir its its hard what is it
well i mean its hairy in there its charlies point
kilgore turns and looks to willard exasperated
charlie dont surf
what seems like hundreds of hueys standing their rotors churning a great wind inside the men of the st cavalry airmobile toughest unit in vietnam
kilgores helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and has surfboards strapped underneath
kilgore strides up to the side door dressed for battle
he looks out around
he turns to his door gunner
how do you feel boy
like a mean motherfucker sir
he turns to his r
helicopter rotors build up speed gas turbines belching fire from their jet pipes dust flying as fifty helicopters rise roar over camera and deploy into attack formation
helicopters moving through the frame almost a dance of dragonflies
willard looks ahead kilgore sits near the door
below they see the jungle whisk by and they are suddenly over the ocean low and fast
close shots of rocket pods mini guns in bizarre looking mounts
close shots of the three surfboards strapped below the command helicopter next to the fearsome weaponry
and finally close shots of the men nervous excited very few of them really scared they fondle their rifles grenade launchers anti personnel grenades claymore mines plastic explosives cord flame
throwers m machine guns expandable rocket launchers mortars and bayonets
kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch the waves then he sits back relaxed
to willard well come in low out of the rising sun well put on the music about a mile out
classical stuff scares the hell out of the slopes the boys love it
pov behind the pilot and co pilot the ocean rushes below
big duke six to eagle thrust turn on coordinates niner assume attack formation
the helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears toward the coast
eagle thrust formation target yards begin psch war operations
the ocean rushes below as suddenly the loudspeakers blare out wagners ride of the valkyries
from the water we see the massive grouping of hueys gun ships troop carriers medevac and recon roar over low in battle formation blaring out ride of the valkyries
pov behind pilot yards commence firing
the whole copter shakes
a vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the beach and palm trees with rice paddies behind
this village commands a delta where ocean and river merge
sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being unloaded
we see bunkers with n
regulars ambling about
suddenly we hear the distant music everyone stops they stare out to see
men scream orders women run from huts bearing ammunition and rifles everywhere there is activity to prepare for the defense of the village
camouflage is removed from anti aircraft emplacements
people feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run to tunnels and trenches
the music grows louder with the faint sound of rotors coming directly at us wagner blaring
looking down through the helicopters as they approach the village
pov behind pilot yards commence firing
the whole copter shakes
we see rockets roar from pods machine guns rattle grenade launchers pound away and mini guns pour streams of lead and tracers with the sound of a diesel pov behind
they roar in over the beach streaming fire from doors pods and nose the ground is alive with smoke and fire a hut explodes
the leads ship banks sharply up over the trees men run below shooting back
explosions crash around the music and sound of the copters almost drown them out
the gunner fires frantically copters are roaring over gunfire rips around
the gunner is blown away
as the ship he is in swoops down its machine guns firing into the village
the pilot leans out and shoots a charging v
in the head with his
then ducks back in
were down eagle thrust were hit
we got a hot l
bullets rip through the plexiglass
the pilot fires back
continuing hell of a hot l
need immediate air strike on the tree line eagle thrust
kilgore has r
equipment he leans out near the door gunner
big duke six to hells angels four bring it in on along tree line and huts
hells angels four to big duke six well need green smoke suggest you have the fac mark it
havent got time hells angels lay it right up the tree line
four f h phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast
the jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees
on radio very good hells angels suggest you follow with cannon fire
they circle the battle
this is baker delta four captain hit bad need dust off
receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left
big duke six to baker delta four hold were right over you
he turns to door gunner
continuing right along the doors boy
the gunner fires leaning out continuing fine
through the roof yeah thats good
he leans back in
continuing didnt anybody bring me any bombs grenades claymores or anything
you didnt tell me to sir
grumbling you shoulda known
suddenly bullets smash through the copter plexiglass shatters the copter vibrates and turns sharply
kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on
continuing sonuvabitch anybody hurt
automatic weapons flashes along those trees probably eleven millimeter guns and ak s
the trees eh
he grabs the r
continuing eagle thrust four big duke six
join me in sparaying some trees
affirmative big duke six were even got some rockets left
take her in low lieutenant
the two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with rockets machine guns and grenade launchers
other copters join the v
break and run through the rice paddies in the f
bullets exploding around them they scream and fall firing back
kilgore looks out as three v
break and run through the rice paddies the helicopter turns and follows them the door gunner swings out and blasts two of them into the mud
he takes a bead on the third
hold it boy
he puts his arms across the sights the gunner swings back inside
continuing take her up to feet lieutenant
they rise above the paddy the man below runs for all hes worth
kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside
kilgore buckles himself into the gunners harness
a hand passes him a m
continuing hard my rifle soldier
there is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a weatherby magnum with a zebra wood stock mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope
kilgore takes it and opens the bolt
amazed at these proceedings
as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges
he gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut
he is running hard but starting to sink into the mud
the huey drones overhead its huge shadow behind him on the mud
he turns and fires with a pistol
kilgore leans out pulls the gun in tight takes careful aim and the cong is blasted flat into the paddy
kilgore leans back opens the bolt ejecting the spent cartridge out the door
he hands weatherby back into the copter
the gaudy rifle passed by him
anyone got a card
somebody hands willard the deck
he takes a card and flips it out of the copter never lifting his gaze from kilgore
americans run through the hooches firing and throwing grenades
helicopters swoop overhead jets roar by uniformed n
regulars burst from a tunnel en trance and charge the americans
the shooting is at point blank range automatic as the v
are cut down
kilgore leans out carefully looking over the battle field
he has the r
he leans back deliberately avoiding willard to speak to lance
s cooling off fast well move in another company an then well own it
he laughs to himself charlies point
he looks out toward the ocean
continuing good swell
i said its a good swell hell of a good swell bout six feet
lets get a look at it
lance looks at willard and then agrees
the pilots are used to this they bank sharply and swoop in on the lineup of waves coming in low over the point and streaking down a long lined up
green wall as if surfing it
they tip up over and up at the last minute as the wave breaks
americans line up blindfolded viet cong and n
regular troops outside a burning hut
gunfire is distant and sporadic an occasional mortar round screams in
a soldier yells in vietnamese in a southern accent and the prisoners are marched away
other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons emplacements cal machine guns etc
three hueys roar in fanning the smoke with their wind
the center one the command ship lands
jets scream over and the two gunships pull up at feet
another huey zooms in low and lands behind the colonels
the doors open guards jump out check the situation and out steps kilgore and lance
from the other copter are more guards kilgores surfers and others of the p
they stride out across the debris strewn beach
kilgore stands majestically on the point watching the waves
a shell screams overhead
they all dive except kilgore
he is watching a big set the shell explodes in the water about a hundred yards away sending up a huge geyser of spray
kilgore is unmoved
look at that
is still pretty hot sir maybe we oughta stand somewhere else
kilgore pays him no mention
im waiting for the fucking boat colonel
without looking itll get here soldier
he turns to mike and johnny who have their faces in the sand
change get out there i wanta see if its ridable change
its still pretty hairy sir
bellowing you wanta surf soldier
he nods yes meakly
continuing thats good boy because its either surf or fight
they turn and hurry off kilgore grabs an m from one of the guards
they all think hes going to shoot the surfers or someone
they move back uneasy
continuing im gonna cover for em thats all
he cocks thye weapon
lance looks around uneasily
the colonel walks over
continuing you think that section on the point is ridable lance
i think we ought to wait for the tide to come in
a shell screams over they all hit the dirt except for kilgore
it explodes throwing sand through the air
kilgore leans down yelling over the noise
doesnt happen for six hours
lance looks up at him terrified holding onto his helmet
continuing the tide doesnt come in for six hours
they walk through shallows carrying brightly colored boards
they look very scared
jets scream overhead firing cannons
helicopters wheel by carrying out wounded
they wear olive drab surfing trunks with the cavs shield on the left leg
the same shield is emblazoned on the boards along the word airmobile
they edge into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak
they paddle up the point in the calm channel the beautiful waves breaking beyond them
they paddle on their stomachs keeping low breathing hard and constantly looking around scared out of their minds
kilgore looks at them with his field glasses
lance kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole
they far enough
sure fine kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from a waiting lackey
through megaphone thats far enough pick one up and come on in they line themselves up on the point
a good set is building
mike turns strokes into it takes off drops to the bottom and turns trims up into a tight section everything right except he keeps looking around frantically
another shell screams over and explodes down the beach
lance looks over at willard
to himself maybe hell get tubed
maybe hell get inside the tube where where they cant see him
a series of shells roar in
lance ducks puts his hands over his head
the shells scream over kilgore and out towards the point
kilgore looks through his glasses two explosions in the water are heard
son of a bitch
lance looks up and out toward the point in horror
two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down on the waves
to himself the tragedy of this war is a dead surfer
willard looks over beginning to think lance is crazy too
just something i read in the free press
they just missed a good set the chicken shits
lance looks up
they come up near their boards and climb on smoke hangs over the water
megaphone try it again you little bastards
he turns to willard
continuing i m not afraid to surf this place
ill surf this place
he turns glowering to his lackeys
bring that r
he grabs it
continuing big duke six to hells angels goddamit i want that treeline bombed yeah napalm gimme some napalm son of a bitch yeah ill take h
s if you got any of them just bomb em into the stone age boy
he throws the r
back to a soldier another salvo whistles over everyone drops
continuing to himself son of a bitch
as the shells explodes on the beach behind him kilgore raises his m and empties it full automatic in the general direction of the trees
he mumbles a few un intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his rifle turning to lance continuing well have this place cleaned up and ready for us
in a jiffy boy
dont you worry
he fires another clip as the jets scream overhead
a sky crane without pod descends slowly toward us the p
hangs below it
the chief mr
clean and chef stand watching this sight alomg with other soldiers
a man guides the descending copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows
the chief and others leap aboard unshackle the hoists load on ammunition and fuel
the battle is still going on around them
they all look up as a wadge of phantoms streak over low and peel off one by one to begin their bombing run
phantoms rake the trees with mm cannons fire five inch rockets in salvo bull pup missiles drop h
high explosives and c
us cluster bomb units and finally an immense amount of napalm
the chief is at the helm the engine starts clean and chef work feverishly ducking for cover every so often when an explosion hits nearby
the boat begins to back out of the shallows
the explosions of napalm are reflected on their faces the roar of the fire drowns out almost everything
forget that extra drum its too damn hot
clear on starboard wheres lance an the captain
i saw that colonels huey on the point two helicopters scream over firing rockets
continuing lets just get outta here
kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses smoke drifts over
lance crouches below
willard is up looking off in another direction
shells scream over but even their noise is drowned out by the fierce shriek of the phantoms and the deafening blast of high explosives
willard stares at the tree line where it comes down to the river
the jets are making a hell of the tree line a hell of fire and bust ling steam thet nothing could live in
willards glance goes further downriver through the black smoke and there merging in the river small and vulnerable is his boat
to lance look
there it is the boat
lance looks over a tremendous relief on his face
but still there remains the threat of kilgore standing stark against the sky
willard silently motions lance toward the boat
whispers hell kill us
he cant kill us
realizing as he says it were on his side
kilgore fires another clip at the tree line and then strides back without looking at them
almost to himself you smell that
louder you smell that
napalm boy nothing else in the world smells like that they reflect the glow from the burning trees
continuing nostalgically i love the smell of napalm in the morning
one time we had a hill bombed for hours
i walked up it when it was all over we didnt find one of em
not one stinking gook body
they slipped out in the night but the smell that gasoline smell the whole hill it smelled like
he looks off nostalgically
you know some day this wars gonna end
sadly yes i know
suddenly he senses something he stops lifts his hand then frantically licks his fingers and puts them up in the air
continuing the wind what
sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases
rising maniacally feel it its the wind its blowing on shore its on shore
he leans down and practically grabs lance
continuing screaming its gonna blow this place out
its gonna ruin it
the kid cant ride sloppy waves
they turn and stare out to sea
the wind has changed
instead of blowing spray back over the waves and hollowing them out this strange wind is causing white caps and cross chop
reducing the swell to slop
mike and johnny lay low on their boards overjoyed
the kid cant stand sloppy waves
you dont expect this kid to ride that crap do you
hes a goddamn artist he needs something to work with
slapping lance on the shoulder
yeah im an artist goddamit
apologetically yeah yeah i can understand how you feel
he turns toward the trees
continuing its the napalm its causing the wind ruining my perfect left
he staggers off toward the trees followed by his guards and other lackeys
continuing mumbling the napalm ruin napalm my perfect left my perfect left point break napalm lance motions with his eyes to willard
along the river shallows the chief and crew waiting and yelling
are you finished surfing
want to say goodbye to the colonel
then lets get the hell out of here
they break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance
our view tracks with them
they are cheered by the crew suddenly willard sees some thing and stops
in a pile of equipment that the hueys have left are two surfboards willard looks at them
no no captain
which ones the colonels
the yater the clear one with the thin stringer
willard glances over to it with determination
there is still mortar fire coming in between him and the board
suddenly willard makes a run for it
incoming son of a bitch
the rounds bracket the p
and line up the beach toward willard
he stands there and doesnt move the surfboard under his arm
the shells kick up sand
lance has dropped
fragments whistle by one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board
calm this one lance
yeah jesus christ
once again willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm
lance follows toward the boat through the water
willard hands the board up to mr
clean and they both scamper abroad exhausted and relieved
whatd you that for
when i was a kid i never had a yater spoon
clean stuffs the board in the stern cal
the boat turns engines running hard and roars off toward the deeper water of the river the board clearly visible on the stern
roars by going down the river at full speed
it is swerving and zig zagging to avoid potential enemy fire
they all are in full battle positions their twin fifty cal
guns turning warily covering the jungled banks
the chief is at helm willard crouches against some armor plate huddled with his m ready
chef is behind him at the radio
lance leans back from his forward turret
yelling maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark we got his yater
he didnt look like hed take that sitting down
they all look up into the sky expecting the worst
continuing lets put some distance between us and charlie
the chief nods
why dont you roll us a big joint
i think the captaind like that
they all look at willard uneasily
after a suspensful pause willard smiles take one a mine he fishes into his breast pocket pulls out a huge cigar sized joint
they all smile willard lights up
it zig zags away from us down the river at high speed
the boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank
the men wait tensely listening you hear it again
no i dont think so
but itll be back
they were circling
itll be back
you think hed of shot us
any time us americans
lance looks over at willard
i dont think he d of shot us on the beach but hed of shot us if he saw me taking the board a yater spoon is hard to get
hes a man who knows what he wants he does know what he wants
can i go get those mangos now
ill go with you in a while judt hold tight awhile captain that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff
and you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped
its a feeling you get in the jungle
when you get good you can find a track and tell not only how many they are but their morale how far theyre going whether theyre near their camp the
weapons theyre carrying
how can you tell their weapons
an how far theyre going
mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest
their morale from the way they drag their feet or the joints that may be lying around
if theyre near a base camp they wouldnt be conserving food theyll be throwing it away half eaten
if the branches arent broken their weapons are slung
but all this is just technique
theres a feeling you get after a while thats whats important
i was going through a village once
i was looking for a certain party
i took off my boots and walked into each hut
it was midnight
i went into three like that and suddenly i realized i d gone into each hut the same way standing up so the next one i went in on my
an rpd burst took out the door a bit above my head
he shrugs things like that
a pause and then suddenly his attention is diverted they all are silent it is pitch dark we hear the distant sound of rotor blades and indistinguishable language on a
loudspeaker the talk stops the rotors grow louder until almost overhead
over a loudspeaker im not gonna hurt or harm you boy i just want the board back you can understand it was one of my best you know how hard
it is to get a board you like boy
im not gonna hurt or harm you just leave it where i can find it the helicopter drones on into the night the same speech starts again further off finally
the noise ceases
jesus that guys too damn much
i wonder if that was the same copter
hes probably got em all over the river with that recording
we better move now while its dark
chef steps forward with a plastic basket
yeah chef go ahead take lance with you ill go with him they all look at him
continuing i wanta get my feet on solid land once in awhile he grabs an m and follows chef over the side
they cautiously walk through the underbrush
yes sir why they call you that
call me what sir
chef is that cause you like mangoes an stuff
no sir im a real chef sir im a sauciere a sauciere thats right sir i come from new orleans i was raised to be a sauciere
a great sauciere
we specialize in sauces my whole family
its what we do
i was supposed to go to paris and study at the escoffier school i was saving the money
they called me for my physical so i figured the navy had better food
what are you doing out here
cook school that did it
they lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib magnificent meat beautifully marbled
then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons all of it boiling
i looked in an it was turning gray
i couldnt stand it
i went into radio school
they move into a slight clearing
whispering quiet chef crouches close redies his m
willard ges tures that he heard something he points
pan slowly over jungle end revealing willard and chef
he points motions chef to move away they cover the spot
a few yards from them they hear something move
it is obviously no small jungle creature
they walk toward a patch of black elephant grass their guns at the ready
they look at each other
willard is cold methodical doing something he knows well
there is a noise again some of the growth rustles
he and chef move a distance apart and join in stalking the probable v
willard directs the chef with hand gestures and bird and cricket sounds
they move stealthily closing the apex of their triangle on the hunted
the two men drop low into the elephant grass and remain motionless
then willard makes the cricket noise and they move closer
willards left hand edges out along the m s far end so that he only has to point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he wants
he makes another command and they rush the trapped enemy
suddenly there is a rushing sound the grass folds down quickly toward them willard plants his feet and from the hip lets go full automatic
the chef retreats firing short bursts into the grass the grass folds almost to willard then a huge tiger leaps out at them snarling magnificently
they fire wildly emptying their clips
its a motherfucking tiger goddamn
he turns and bolts through the jungle as scared as a man can be
continuing screaming goddamn jesus christ tiger motherfucking tiger ohhhhhhhhh willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of the clearing covering the bushes and runs scared out of
his head as well
they all are armed lance has the twin s pointed into the jungle
chef comes screaming out of the brush throws his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it
hysterical ohhhh tiger
its a tiger
goddamn a tiger
the chief tries to grab him takes his gun away but is unable to take a hold of the chef as he slithers around the boat trying to find safety
willard follows from the jungle the chef is moaning and stares off into the night
whats this tiger shit
i think i shot the hell out of him
i wasn t looking
i was running
was a big tiger no shit
who stopped to measure him lets get the hell out of here
a motherfucking tiger i couldve been killed
the engine roars to life the p
pulls away with great speed
you forgot the mangoes didnt you
there as a fucking tiger in the woods i couldve been eaten alive
im never going into that jungle again
i gotta remember never get out of the boat never get outta the boat
they move off swallowed by the darkness
the jungle noises remain as our view begins a move into the jungle
he was right the chef never go into the jungle unless youre ready to go all the way
willard thinking his back to us
suddenly he turns around and we see his face
what was in the jungle
what was there waiting for me
he lights the cigarette the light of his match illuminating his face momentarily
there is something different about him a maturity a cool inner peace
continuing kurtz was in there
or was he was it kurtz
he was just a name to me now i couldnt remember a face a voice he just didnt add up to me
all his liberal bullshit about the end of savagery and the role of our culture our way of life
willard looks toward the group of people on the boat there is still some music
they talk and drink and laugh
continuing our way of life i really started to look forward to meeting kurtz again
we hear must remember that we owe our thanks for these to the wonderful services of the u
heres another oldie this one dedicated
by himself on the p
he has wiped mud under his eyes to kill the glare it is incredibly hot
he is barechested wearing a hat made of a banana palm
to the fire team at an khe from their groovy c
fred the head the rolling stones and satisfaction
the song blares on they all dig it
pan to willard sitting alone in the rear reading from his file on kurtz
we reveal lance in the b
water skiing behind the p
slaloming back and forth on his single ski to the music jumping the wake occasion ally
lance waterskiing to satisfaction
alert at the rear of the boat his m ready just in case
willard opens a letter from the packet
we can see it is a private correspondence feminine writing on the envelope
the dossier of a dtachment contained letters from the families and wives of kurtz men there were letters from kurtz wife as well
it is addressed to colonel walter kurtz in the corner is the return addess of mrs
colonel walter kurtz willards hand fushes through the packet and comes up with apicture of a very attractive thirty five year old american beauty
she is classically american
looking at the picture puts it back then opens the letter straightens it
dearest walt i have to confess something
i know how you feel about this but i had to ask bob to find out what he could i just couldnt stand it anymore not knowing where you are
whether youre alive or dead
im sorry walt im sorry i said that
bob didnt tell me anything he said he couldnt i cant stand it anymore walt i just cant stand it
willard looks out at the jungle
deep imppenetrable jungle dark and primeval forests pass by
the rolling stones chant on in the b
continuing i have to take the kids to school every morning now carpools just never work out
jeff came home with a black eye on tuesday but said he won anyway
he wouldnt tell me what the fight was about
jeff keeps asking where you are he has maps of viet nam in his room now
he misses you very much
i cant take this much longer walt
i love you and i just cant stand it
he folds the letter up files through some others quickly and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped top secret with a stenciled date on it
it is also noted that this was the last correspondence to leave nu mung ba
it is addressed to kurtz wife
he opens the letter it is written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic ular
it reads sell the house sell the car sell the kids find someone else forget it im never coming back forget it he folds up the letter
he looks out at the ominous jungled mountains
pulls in towards an american outpost that is being used as a forward medical evacuation center
various helicopters pads are seen but only one heli copter the h painted with playboy rabbits that brought the girls to hau fat
several soldiers in rain coats come out the dock as the p
willard looks into some empty tents looks around the dreary muddy camp
two soldiers pass
soldier where s your c
stepped on a booby trap sir got blown all to hell well whos in command here
i dont know dont have any idea im just the night man he turns and walks off babbling incoherently what about you soldier
the soldier he was talking to turns around smiling idiotically and making animal noises
he stumbles off after his friend
he looks around disgustedly whispering captain willard turns around looking for where the voice came from
continuing over here captain he turns to see the hollywood agent under the flap of a large tent so that he wont get wet
he wears the same clothes as before but is much dirtier
he motions willard into the tent
they duck inside it is dark and damp
on cots around astove sit the three playmates and the pilot
the nearest one cathy a blonde picks leeches out of her feet
the other two terri and lynda play cards with the helicopter pilot
willard looks over the situation

continuing its really rough here captain were just not built for it the pilot laughs

the boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the distance
along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations with u
soldiers in them
there is a bright fire burning uncontrolled in the distance the sparks and white light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the night
two days and nights later we approach the do lung bridge
everywhere are wrecked boats parts of trunks sticking out of the water smashed helicopters on the banks
the bridge is in a state of siege
mortars and rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby jungle
soldiers are everywhere scurrying from trenches carrying materials for the bridge or tending to the wounded the maimed and the dead
light automatic weapon fire is heard occasionally
edges in under the span of the old bridge
soldiers run up through the water
they are obscured in the darkness
i gotta get out a here i ll pay i got money
get away from this boat
whos your c
the soldier ducks back and runs away
fuck you youll get whats coming to you
other men approach the boat
a young lieutenant steps forward
captain willard we got these from nha thrang two days ago they expected you here then he hands up a plastic bag maximum security markings willard takes it
continuing you dont know how happy that makes me sir
now i can get out a here if i can find a way out
well be needing some supplies and fuel do you know anybody who can give me a hand

theyre gonna start working on the bridge with torches again
charlie will start throwing it in hard what is this bridge
its of strategic importance for keeping the highway into bat shan open the generals dont like to admit that bat shan is surrounded
he points to the men getting ready to work
continuing every night we build it and by theyve blown it up it and a lot of good men but the generals like to say the road is open ha
nobody uses that road except charlie
he turns and splashes off into the darkness
continuing this is the cesspool of hell
shells whistle over and crash into the bridge men scream in the distance the explosions are thunderous
yelling all right lance go with the captain an see what you can scrounge willard climbs out with lance
continuing to willard better make it fast sir we dont really need much anyway
willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the bridge
they dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road
shells scream overhead they dont know where to run
straight ahead son of a bitch
they dive towards the voice
they dive in a soldier is crounched in f
holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably
you came right to it son of a bitch son of a bitch sir
the soldier doesnt respond
continuing wheres your chief supply officer
beverly hills what
straight up the road a concrete bunker beverly hills where else you think hed be
cmon there is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road
suddenly to their right an m starts opening up from a sandbagged emplacement
get your asses down buddy
they drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement
several soldiers man a m
one has a sniper rifle another tries to spot for the gunner
willard and lance edge up along the trench
watch your feet asshole willard looks down
continuing you stepped on my face
we thought you were dead
the whole world loves a smart ass
they move ahead more carefully
the gunner blasts away into the night there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him
finally he stops swearing to himself
whatre you shooting at soldier
he turns and sees its an officer
continuing i m sorry sir
its all right sergeant whats out there
they were tryin to cut through the wire i got em all i think
oh yeah listen
there is a low moaning scream from out in the wire it stops for aminute then continues hideously
hes trying to call his friends send up a flare
the spotter does it arcs up then bathes them in eerie light
the gunner fires a long burst
those are all dead stupid hes obviously underneath em they think about this as the flare goes out
the screaming gets more intense
wake up the roach
the spotter moves down to where a tall lanky soldier is leaned up against the trench
he kicks him hard several times
roach wakes and just looks up
on his helmet are the words god bless dow
slope in the wire hear him
he listens he does he nods
continuing bust him
roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool
he saunters up the machine gun dragging his m which has paisley designs all over it
you need a flare no it s cool
he opens the breech of his shotgun like weapon and plunks the big slug into it
he snaps it closed then rests it across his forearm over the trench he listens to the scream calculating
continuing hes close real close
he adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into the air
he listens again then fires
the grenade whistles off into the night
there is a sharp explosion that cuts off the scream
then the thud of bodies or pieces of bodies coming down around them
continuing muhhh fuhhh
he staggers back down the trench to go to sleep
they stand in the shallows waiting for willard and lance
clean is nervous he constantly checks his m
shells whistle by and crash in the distance
geez i wish theyd hurry
a soldier comes up on his way with some others to start building the bridge
hey buddy that boat still runs eh
yeah it still runs
do me a favor buddy please
what is it
he takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes
send these out when you get back to the world
he puts them in cleans hand
continuing its to everyone i really knew the first girl i screwed my brother best friend i wanted to tell em how much i enjoyed knowing em its been a
great twenty years
i gotta let em know

nobody comes in here
he points up at the mountain ridges
continuing the n
th over there the th on that hill we counted fourteen different guns in one minute they got rockets mortars snipers in those trees theres a million of those shitty
little bastards out there were all gonna die
he grabs clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency
continuing im gonna be dead
clean takes the letters
continuing you got a chance in that boat by morning you could be five miles down the river
we aint goin down the river
the soldier looks at him as if he is joking
continuing whats up river from here anyhow the soldier doesnt answer just stares dumbfounded
no itd be spooky without the war give em back
he takes the letters and leaves somewhat disappointed and disgusted
willard and lance come back down the beach carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra m s
wow you must a found the c
we found some bodies lets get out a here
they edge through the shallows as the men light up their welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge then pull away and accelerate fast
the chief is at the helm they all look back in the distance where the bridge was the hills flash with artillery discharges there is a fiery glow from the
bridge area and the concussion of heavy explosions
the boat moves uneasily upriver through this tropical downpour
clean is in thef
oiling and cleaning his cal his m and m the rest of the crew are forward taking shelter from the rain under the canvas canopy
clean works methodically under an umbrella he was set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount
the river is moving fast against them
all manner of de bris tree trunks sweeping by the p
to willard i cant see a fucking thing
there is a loud cracking sound as one of the pieces of tree trunk whacks the hull and bounces off
willard climbs forward and looks down
continuing we hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a corvette
fucking plastic boat
willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole warding off the big debris moving toward the p
clean joins him helping
shouting to chief what about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down
who knows whats up there
cant be any worse than this
what do you think
i think this river wants to take us home fast
im practically goin in reverse
willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary
well get in there
this whole area is lousy with v
we dont stand a chance
lemme turn around and well be in hau fat in six minutes
there is a really loud whack against the hull
willard really mad throws the pole at the chief who ducks
get in there
this is my crew and my fucking boat and im the responsible party
get in there now or ill bury you in this river
its clear that willard will kill the chief if he doesnt do as he says
finally relents turns the helm youre fucking crazy
youre going to get us all killed
navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary
rain is pouring down but the p
is slowed down to a snails pace by hyacinths literally across the waterway
willard chef and clean in the water cutting through them with machetes
having climbed to the highest point of the cockpit
it breaks through in about twenty feet
he looks to chef who has stopped cut ting and is staring into the jungle
what do you see
i dont know
he looks out the jungle at this point is very dark and high totally impenetrable
they work feverishly knowing something is wrong
cutting with all hes got
i know it sounds stupid but i feel like the goddamn jungles watching us
whatdoya think it thinks
that were dumber than we look
chef stops again looks hard trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it the darkness of it comes a stream of tracers lazily arching out at
it whips between them the sound following much later
other bullets smash through and ricochet off the deck fittings
glass shatters and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a mm cannon
lance bout twenty meters starboard
lance leaps down to his position
willard clean and chef cut feverishly as the trapped boat struggles to get free
there in the trees
everything is confusion yelling gunfire the thud of heavy bullets ripping inti the p
s fibreglass hull
lances twin guns return the fire
the chief moves to one of the heavy guns and joins lance in returning the fire
bullets smash and explode around
clean climbs onto the boat and leaps onto a gun emplace ment
nobody really knows where the erratic fire is coming from
back at the helm elevate lance in the tree
no i saw another
thirty meters up lance i saw the fucking flash
lance grits his teeth firing he blasts short bursts of tracers into the jungle cutting it to salad
suddenly more tracers from another direction clean swings around bullets smash against his shield and rip chunks from the surfboard
he blasts a long heavy burst at the jungle trees crumble
im ripping em man son of a bitch its jammed oh god its jammed
clean is riddled by machine gun fire
chief runs to mr
clean it is obvious that he is dead
he looks angrily to willard
willard and chef are practically through
willard leaps up as chef finishes the last strokes
he moves toward the cockpit
throw me that ordnance
chef throws him an m and several shells willard opens it jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over the edge of the cockpit
continuing give me some kind a field a fire bullets rip by
exhausted were through
he climbs aboard and collapses
continuing oh god i aint finished
i aint finished
bring that bow ordnance into those trees
he jams his gun up as he sees a flash and fires there is a low pop and a whistle as the grenade arches into the jungle
he fires another burst as the grenade explodes brightly
there is another pop and whistle another blast
a large tree falls just as the craft speeds up through the thin ning growth
we hear strange screaming from the trees and jungle hideous moans and terror filled cries
he jams the throttle forward the boat surges ahead
willard fires another grenade from his m
the boat slams through the hyacinth growth moving through the river firing back at unseen enemy in the jungle
the boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide flat area in the river
the men sit around exhausted brutalized wounded
they look like animals but they are relaxed be cause they know theyre too far from the banks to be shot at
they smoke pot and eat silently
lance smokes a joint and looks at his gun
splotches of paint have been blown away from the armor shield pieces of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount
the boat is a floating wreck
cleans body is being prepared in a plastic sack by chief
all of the men are silent
chef comes up from below he has been wounded in the shoulder
theres some bad holes man and the cracks waters coming through the cracks
foods shot to hell
how much is left
less than half sure is a mess down there
chief has been silent by the body of clean in a plastic sack
and the grass
still got a lot of that stuff from nha trang
but were running low on the other
chief pushes cleans body into the river
he notices something in the distance
willard stands up pointing up the river
they all look over
continuing thats a light down there yeah it is
what the hell is it
in the middle of the jungle a goddamn light
approaches the distant light which seems to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building
straining to see he uses field glasses
seems to be some figures standing on the dock
the figures pull back behind some drums
they duck as shots ring out from the dock stitching the water across the p
the crew crouches guns trained on the dock as the boat still approaches
continuing theyre not cong
over the loud hailer were americans
another burst closer
maybe you shouldnt say were americans
willard stares at the dock and building trying to figure it out
chef try your french
chief hands the loud hailer to chef who shrugs and shouts nous sommes americains silence
continuing nous ne voulon pas vous agresser
he looks through the glasses
gradually a small group appears from behind the drums on the dock
french nationals they may not be too friendly though
we drift closer to the dock
the chef starts enjoying speaking french
nous sommes americains nous sommes des amis there is silence as the boat drifts closer
then shouting out vous parlez francais comme une vache espanole
to himself i thought it was pretty good myself
whatd he say
said i speak french like a spanish cow
laisser tomber vos armes put the guns straight up stand away from the mounts
vous pouvez approcher mais doucement take her in slow
the men on the dock move forward cautiously
they are a young man philippe about strong and handsome save for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left eye which is covered by
he is dressed in a tiger suit and the red beret of the french colonial para troops
also of the red beret are henry lefevre a bear ded dark looking man of and tran van kac a middle aged half breed slave
they all bear automatic weapons and suspicious in their eyes
as the boat pulls up to the dock another frenchman joins the group obviously the head man gaston de marais about fifty small and deli cate with a strength about
hands on the heads
i cant steer with my goddamn feet
hey they speak american
who is the commanding officer
i am im captain b
this is chief warrant officer phillips its his boat
we were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food we can pay you in gold
philippe philippe moves to another position kac grabs the rope from the deck and ties it to the dock
ill help you with do not move gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly
fifty calibers eh captain as i said we can pay you in gold
entirely unnecessary captain
he puts down his gun the others do likewise we share a common enemy you are our guests
he steps back i am gaston de marais this is my familys plantation
it has been such for years
it will be such after i die
this is my son philippe he has fought in algeria and held the rank of captain
and henry lefevre a sergeant he was at dien bien phu
my personal servant tran van kac then he motions to the trees
a young man in a tiger suit and three women come forward from different positions all wear bush clothing and bear weapons
continuing my youngest son christian he carries an m machine gun in his hand a belt of ammunition trailing off behind him
christians wife ann marie a tall girl goodlooking but severe she carries an continuing and my youngest daughter claudine
an attractive girl about eighteen
she wears a red paratrooper beret and a well fitted bush suit
she carries an m grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition
they stand there exhausted and amazed
philippe yells in vietnamese about a dozen native men in tiger suits heavily armed walk out of the trees from all around them
they look the americans over warily and assemble at philippes command
we took them from the dead
smiles now i assume you want to rest to shower
well attend to your repairs after dinner
willards men look at one another dazed
we dont want to bother you any we a man of war is never bothered to aid an ally you will follow me captain
willard steps off then stops reaches back and picks up his m by the stock
a habit of men of war sir you understand
of course captain an unfortunate necessity
the men are relieved
they pick up their weapons and follow
what about the boat
my men will keep it for you yeah well ill stay with the boat
pause come with us
they look at each other a moment
the chief shrugs and follows
gaston stops points to a guest house off the main struc ture which is a typical jungle plantation house save the many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire
a suitable accomodation for your men captain you will of course be quartered with us he indicates that the men should follow philippe
the chief is hesitant
go ahead philippe leads them on muttering
captain this way
willard follows they walk over past the house and toward the jungle approaching a huge crater feet across and about thirty feet deep
the bottom is filled with water and young french and vietnamese children swim in it
on the opposite rim sit two men and a woman with machine guns
gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride
continuing magnificent eh captain
continuing it is very good there is no current it is very good
i have never seen one like it in all indochina
i was in paris when it arrived do you know what might have caused looks like a two thousand pound to me
yeah a two thousand pound bomb
no ive seen those in normandy
this is much better
pause my country my country could never originate this
gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat willard looks between him and this big hole in the ground in amezement
a foremans shower from the old plantation days
the chief steps out of it refreshed though still exhausted
lance stands there about to step in absolutely filthy caked with blood
his reaction is odd rather than just stepping into the shower he seems almost frightened reluctant to step in
chef is waiting behind him
a hot shower hot damn
he pushes him forward into the water
the dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is
battered and torn a few of philippes vietnamese guard at the boat
a beautiful european room with tall ceilings
still elegantly furnished although old and decaying
willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of the room looking out over the carpet the bed with its elegant spread the wash basin the bidet
his battle dress is black with muck with bloodstaines and burns
he rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above which is a large mirror
there is an album on the marble top of the dresser
he turns to a page at random
haggard looking down at the album
i wondered how long has this room been like this how long has the furniture been standing in these places
some old photographs of people standing around a car in the s in front of the plantation
another picture shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the plantation
was it like this sixty years ago
but here even eighty years is nothing
he turns the page the plantation being built
pictures of the framing skeletal against the sky and jungle
fascinated it was jungle once and it will be jungle again
onlu the very beginnings of the house the first struc tures
then another picture of the jungle site where it was to be built
he looks up and sees his own face reflected in the garish mirror
he barely recognizes himself
willard looks at himself in the mirror in this odd out of time room
track down the long table covered with delicious food
crew sits with others of the de marais group
the table is headed by st
chefs face lights up as he regards the wonderful european style food
this food is wonderful
i cant believe the chef is a slope
turning to clean some more
opposite the table sitting next to the chief lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands
continuing hey lance
wouldya pass me the rice a roni please
and then he looks to his friends for approval
our view reveals that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another more elaborate table where the de marais family is dining with willard
our view moves through the curtain and settles in a medium view of the group
the men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room
willard finally does as well and she moves to the chair next to him
roxanne i hope you are feeling better
je vais bien maintenant
may i present captain willard
he is of a paratroop regiment
you know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier dont you my dear
smiling and taking willards hand yes they come from the sky
she sits theres an uneasy silence
willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him and the ongoing conversation on the other
he is forced to face toward gaston and drawn to look at roxanne
i would like to know more about the
philippe turns around points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it
attacks repulsed as i was saying
hard this is only for this war captain
viet cong north vietnamese regular forces south vietnamese regular forces and otherwise
of course they were perhaps mistakes captain
i once we make our repairs we could send word we could have you evacuated from here
youll get blown outta here some day
we will never evacuate captain this is our home
indochina is ours it has been so for a hundred and twenty one years there is something to say for that
the vietnamese think its theirs i guess the americans do too
but we civilized it
a place belongs to those who bring light to it dont you agree
i always thought the french came here to get the rubber
excuse me i must attend to my men
he gets up and leaves abruptely followed by his wife
may i ask where the captain is going in his little boat
we were going upriver when we got caught in a storm maam
there is nothing there only jungle
do you know that jungle
when i was a boy my father would take me there to hunt
there are a few savages but no man can live there no white man
what about an american named kurtz
there is a pause
we have never heard of him
gaston rises and takes roxannes hand
continuing bon nuit roxanne bon nuit captain
willard and roxanne are left alone
the servants clear the table
you must realize captain we have lost much here i my husband
gaston his wife and son
im sorry to hear that
i should be checking on the boat
the war will still be here tomorrow
she walks out of the room
thinking i guess so
roxanne sits pouring a brandy while willard stands
do you miss your home captain
have you someone there
i was discharged from the army four years ago
i went home wasted some time bought a mustang mach drove it a week
then i re upped for another tour
no everything i love is here
then you are like us
she reaches out to him indicating that he sit
continuing what will you do after the war
i just follow my footsteps one at a time trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones
whats a big question
pause i know youve heard of him
what did you hear
that strange things
terrible things have occured around this american kurtz
gaston would never tell me
it was asubject not to be spoken of captain
did you know deeper in the jungle upriver there are savages
but captain i mean cannibals
a long pause
then she looks at the cognac she poured for him
continuing what a pity you dont drink
since my husband died there are so many things i must do alone
she takes a sip
willard moves to the french doors which have been left partly open to let a breeze in
he steps onto a terrace overlooking the river
a machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover ing the front of house from the river
from the sitting room are you warm captain
the river is beautiful
in fact we realize that he is checking the boat
is under guard by a couple of gastons vietnamese
she thinking it romantic to talk about the river comes up behind him
i spend hours watching that river from my bedroom window
it fascinates me
she moves her body close to his and in a moment he is kissing her
one eye steals another look at the p
two of the guards leave two remain getting ready for the long night
his hands wander over her body as she clings to him
then she takes his hand and leads him back into the sitting room and up the stairs
it is dark
she leads him into her room and closes the door
he stands there
in the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it
the windows also have netting and barbed wire there is a
calibre machine gun mount in the far one
he look around
she goes over to the bed and turns down the sheets
then she slips out of her dress and stands there facing him
he puts down his gun and strips off his shirt
she lays down on the bed and watches him
i have been lonely here captain
he moves to her slipping into the bed
m is leaning against the wall in his reach
we can view into the room as willard has silently slipped out of her bed and is a dark sinister figure kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
without a sound he comes out to the terrace and scales down the wall of the old building disappearing into the darkness
two vietnamese guard the p
suddenly feet first the first disappears into the thicket
in the thicket we realize he has just killed the man with a knife
willard stalks the second guard and makes quick work of him with his knife
he even enjoys it
silently he drags the body out of sight
the dark figure boards the boat silently
he disappears into the hold
he lifts out several cases of supplies working quickly with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his best work alone and at night
he sleeps soundly alone in the bed we hear someone moving around in the room
he wakes suddenly pull back to reveal roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up her blouse
she notices he is awake and smiles
i will fix you breakfast
he starts to get up
im afraid i wont have time i gotta whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores a case of grenades a mortar and two
m s and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order
he stops seemingly stunned
so thats it
you may think what you wish captain but i like you very much
she turns to go
what if i say no
then philippe will have to kill all of you
he walks down onto the dock
gastons men are transferring ammunition boxes
gaston is standing with philippe who are covering the chief and crew with m s
two of my men deserted last night
it happens from time to time
i assume my daughter told you of our conditions
they taking half our ammo captain said it was your orders
he pauses for a second
thats right i did
the chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the engines
willard looks hard at gaston
i guess this is what men of war do eh
we endure captain you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar destroy that and well dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it
burn the forest and well hide in the swamp
all the while we do but one thing clean the blood off our bayonets
pause au revoir captain
willard climbs on board and it pulls away
the boat roars out across the river
the chief looks over at willard
they stare at each other for a moment
next time we get in a good fire fight id like to know how she was captain
willard just smiles at the chief
he leans over and pulls up a floorboard the men stare in amezement it contains the contents of all those ammo boxes
calibre clips grenades
what did you put in all those ammo boxes
rocks sand those two men who deserted
whend you do it
while you were sleeping
he lets the board drop
willard moves to the back of the boat
the river has narrowed and runs swifter the water dark and deep
the trees are higher in this area and much of the river is shaded on one side
there is no undergrowth just the tall trees and ferms
they move ahead at half speed alert ready for anything
we moved deeper and deeper into the jungle
it was very quiet there
it was like wandering on a prehistoric planet an unknown world
where the men thought they crawled to i dont know
for me we crawled toward kurtz exclusively
willard looks out ahead and points
they all turn their guns in that direction
we pan to reveal a small village of huts along the bank
they pass in front of the village which is rundown and completely deserted
the huts are on stilts to avoid the flooding of the river they are just skeletons of what they once were
no most of em are still standing mightve been disease
i dont know thered still be some sign its just like the one this morning
the canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across the river filtering the sun
the forest itself has grown darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers
strange birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes a huge snake slips along an overheading limb
the depth of the jungle is dark ominous yet cool and strangely inviting
suddenly the river widens the trees give way to marsh and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls upon the boat
it is the shadow cast by an enormous vertical tail section of a b bomber thrusting out from the mud
pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it oxi dizing in the sun
creepers have already started to grow up around its heights the jungle is claiming it
but once under its shadow they have passed a gateway
a gateway to paradise
the river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and seductive
the hills beyond are purple and lush
strange orange colored water fowl swim lazily out of their way
the water itself is glass smooth and black as if there were no bottom
the sun is warm and the breeze gentle and laced with wild gardenians
it is indeed the most peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon it and has never known such a sense of peace and well being
each man in his heart feels a need to stay his soul cries to stop stop their madness this spiral into hell
here is all that can be had of earth
but no hand moves
the boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of the clearing
a hole into the jungle from which a darkness permeats
the boat follows the river into this hole
the skull looms in the f
is pulled back about seventy yards early morning mist still hangs on the water as it clears we see another post and skulls on the opposite bank it is strangely
all right lance lances twin fifties split the silence as they pour into the skulls on the opposite bank suddenly there is a tremendous explosion and secondary ones from the
jungle as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from claymore mines obviously set to cover the mound of skulls
the smoke clears
the other one no leave it why charlie put it there to kill thtas not charlies work there is silence
whoever putem there didnt do it to kill people they put em up as signs signs
yeah like keep out willard motions the chief accelerates they move ahead past the smoking mound
pushed deeper into this mysterious area
mist swells in and around the river as the boat moves into an obscure fog
the chief cuts the engine and they coast
toward the night of the fifth day out of do lung bridge we judged ourselves about eight miles from kurtz base
everything was still the trees the creepers even the brush seemed like it had been changed into some kind of stone
it was unnatural like a trance
not a sound could be heard
i began to think i was deaf then the fog came suddenly and i was blind too
the boat disappears in the thick fog
we catch glimpses of him even though we are close
what is it
they are silent
we can hear the most ominous sound coming from the banks
the groaning or wailing
of theyre on the banks of the river
frantically he swings the twin fifties around
we can barely see him in and out of the fog
not while you cant see
the sound is terrible horrifying
will they attack
if they have boats
theyd get lost in the fog
we cant move either well end up on the shore
sounds like hundreds of them
the chorus of groans in unbearable
but it is not ahostile cahnt or a war chant but rather the sound of human continuing it doesnt sound hostile it sounds like theyve seen us coming and it
sounds like i dont know a funeral
i dont understand
a glimpse of him almost in tears
we then see glimpses fog moving of all the men on the p
moving through the thinning mist
the navy craft proceeds cautiously
two hours after the fog lifted we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below kurtzs camp
we approached a long sand bank stretching down the middle of the river
right or left
looks pretty shallow
moves toard the right most channel
chef takes a long pole and begins sounding depth
the men are really tense now lances swivels his gun from bank to bank
chief keeps his fingers on an m
willard takes out the top secret packet he received at do lung
tears it open
we move in on him
reading upon reaching objective
target key personnel and commence operation
should difficulty arise from which extraction is impossible break radio silence com sec command code strong arm indicate purgative air strike code street gang
pause purgative air strike
theyd kill me too
suddenly chef lays out flat on the bow
hundreds and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the p
rattling against the boat
theyre shooting fucking arrows at us
looking toward the banks
frags of men naked limbs arms breasts glaring eyes entangled in the dense jungle gloom
and hundreds of pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them
crazily zig zagging up the river in the midst of the childish assault
steer her right
arrows hitting the deck
the men open up everything theyve got
lance is firing the two fifties wildly
theyre just fucking sticks
chief stay at the helm
but chief seems out of control he lets the clip of his m go
then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands and falls to willards feet a primitive spear having caught him right through the ribs
willard looks down in horror
laying at willards feet the long spear through him bleeding onto willards boots
he looks up at willard about to say something
the men are still crazily firing into the empty jungle long after those who attacked beat their retreat
stop it slowly he pulls his boots from under chief
they are absolutely soaked in blood
he is stunned sits down and begins to unlace the bloody boots and take them off
willard unlaces the other boot and holds the bloody boot in his hand
it was the strangest thing i dont know that i can explain it
two of my men dead and all i could think of was whether kurtz was dead too
thats all i wanted to see kurtz to hear kurtz
he starts to wipe the blood off the boot
continuing somehow in the middle of this
carnival kurtz had grown into something a gifted officer a great man
somehow he was the only light in this hopeless hopeless darkness
and now i was too late he was probably gone disappeared
by a grenade rolled into his tent or by some spear on the head
christ i felt like howling like those animals in the fog
the people at charlies cocktail party on the boat
some flashbulbs are going off
some people are dancing to the music
our view moves slowly toward willard on the edge of the party
here they are in los angeles
everything is safe
theres a supermarket around the corner the police station around the other
it would seem ridiculous to them that i was shot to hell because i had lost the privilege of listening to the mysterious colonel kurtz
pause of course i was wrong
he was waiting for me
kurtz was alive and he was waiting for me
moving up the river
the men are practically in a trance now looking at the banks of the river
they don t even make an effort to touch their weapons
hundreds and hundreds of montagnard natives dressed in the most ornate and primitive manner feathers parts of birds and animals cod pieces all in body and face paint of the
most savage nature
but there is a purity about them men and boys standing passively watching the small navy craft flying the strange flag of red white and blue
the men of the crew are not the same men who began this voyage
their manner is lifeless as though in a trance
the various decorations and paraphenelia that they have picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the savages that stand before them
the chef has made a hat of birdfeathers lances face has been painted with mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun
he wears certain animal skins trinkets some animal teeth
their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the difficult journey
they start to move to their gun positions
just stand here with me where they can see us
moving slowly toward the fantastic human wall of feathers and war paint standing on canoes across the river
the men on the crew stand in a group their hands visibly without weapons
the natives standing across the river make no hostile gestures as they approach
they accept the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi tability
the boat moves closer approaches the wall of feathers which slowly and automatically gives away in almost a ritual of birth undulating allowing the little boat to penetrate
mus on his face to protect it from the sun the palms of some jungle vegetation protecting his head he looks something like atribal chieftan himself
his intuition was right
he senses that they would be allowed to pass
hundreds of montagnards who had been lining the river now run absolutely silently along the banks keeping pace with the p
there is no hostility in these faces only curiosity and a sort of grief
they look up toward the bank
the temple at nu mung ba a fortified encampment built around the ruins of a former cambodian civilization
stone walls barbed wire cracked pyramids and rows and rows of escher like sandbags arranged in an endless maze around the fortress
he picks up his field glasses and looks through
a sign entangled in the barbed wire its lettering strict and military the glasses pov moves revealing another sign written in a wild psychedelic hand
the pov of the glasses move once again and come upon an astonished sight a black man dressed in a tatter of colored fabrics feathers and an australian bush hat
he looks something like a multi colored harlequin waving frantically to the p
the pov of the glasses move off of him
not believing what hes just seen
once again the young black man is now waving his australian hat
willard shouts out to the starnge greeter
weve been attacked
shouting back i know i know its all right
come in this way
its mined over there
its all right
willard look at chef who is at the helm
he shrugs and they do as this man says
moves towards the waters edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire
the odd australian stands waving his hat guiding them safely in
a thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle
near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses half sub merged in the water
other piles of bodies lie about some of them on fire
fire literally burns from out of the ground
chef nods at the bodies
looks that way
looking at the australian whos he
the boat pulls up
the australian harlequin hops on board the crew regards him with their dark faces splat tered with mud and blood
continuing who the hell are you
got any winstons
moonby th battalion royal australian regiment task force
ex corporal moonby deserted incredulously indicating the hundreds of natives what is this
oh theyre simple enough people
its good to see you baby
nobody has any winstons
chef automatically offers moonby a winston
this boats a mess
i want to talk to him
oh you dont talk to colonel kurtz
he puffs then smiles you listen to him
god these are good
i kept these people off you you know
it wasnt easy
why did they attack us
they dont want him to go
pre australian actually
but id dig goin to california
im california dreamin
almost to himself so kurtz is alive
i tell you that man has enlarged my mind
he opens his arms wide to indicate the breadth of his minds expansion
continuing but lemme tell you he is the most dangerous thing in every way that ive come on so far
he wanted to shoot me
the first thing he said is im going to shoot you because you are a deserter
i said i didnt desert from your army i deserted from my army
he said im going to shoot you just the same
why didnt he shoot you
ive asked myself that question
i said to myself why didnt he shoot me
he didnt shoot me because i had a stash like you wouldnt believe
i hid it in the jungle the wealth of the orient marijuana hashish opium cocaine uncut heroin the gold of the golden triangle
and acid i make koolaid that makes purple owsley come on like piss
now im kurtz own disciple i listen he talks
i forgot theres such a thing as sleep
of love too
oh no not what you think
he made me see things things you know
the whole time moonby is chattering on willard has picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress
men in small groups huddled over food
now he settles on the entrance in the temple
there are stakes in front and on top of them are horrible shrunken heads
sounds like hes gone crazy
no colonel kurtz couldnt be crazy if you heard him talk just last week youd never think he was crazy
is that where he is
by the shrunken heads
those heads yes
well the rebels
to his men were going ashore
tie her up and leave your guns up lance
bring your rifles thats all
looking at moonby take us to him
right on hes been waiting for and shut up
moonby nods and shrugs and hops off the p
willard and the men follow
as they proceed closer to the fortress temple men appear where a moment before there was only jungle
they are mostly montagnards but far more savage looking than any weve seen before
they wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition
their bodies are painted in strange patterns
they carry army m s russian ak s and a wide variety of knives and clubs
women emerge from the brush as well
they are armed and equally primitive looking
interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins with the remnants of army insignia on them
the paint on their bodies is if anything more bizarre
we continue to move across the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky
willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of captain cook
they encounter in the center of the group what once appears to have been an american
he is tall gaunt wears a flak jacket but is otherwise naked save a loincloth
his face is darkened from dirt battle smoke strange camouflage patterns
his hair and beard are long matted with mud and grease
he carries an ak decorated with scalps and human ears
willard approaches this beast who seems shy and retiring
who are you
breaking in his name is
im not ever goin to tell you to shut up again
moonby shuts up
the man tries to speak but nothing comes out
he is dumbstrucked at seeing them as they are to see him
officer a team
walter kurtz commanding
what happened here
what happened here
theyre coming again tonight
tet their big assault
willard is the man in the middle he doesnt know what to say to this man but he understands the forces that pounded him
he takes his arm
looks at willard not understanding
six months later and he and colby would be identical
im taking you back
moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand
oh no don t say that
take us back
take us back
but the operation the team
colonel kurtz has such plans for the team
take me to him major
colby starts and then seeing the shrunken heads on poles he turns agitated to willard i had nothing to do with these operations i did not do the planning none
of us did
it was all colonel kurtz he was the genius
youll see the genius of our colonel
he should be made a general dont you think
suddenly frightened he stops
without looking willard knows that kurtz is standing behind him
kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters he is a powerful man though obviously very ill
he slowly attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together though it is ripped and bloodied and now combined with primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief as well
as his u
he is feverish with long blonde hair and beautiful features
his eyes almost hypnotize
his midsection is bandaged from what seems to be a serious wound
this is not what he expected
he is quiet and then automatically he comes to an attention
colonel kurtz i guess
he salutes captain b
willard reporting his presence sir
looking at him a long time
then he returns the salute and simply at ease
pause as he regards him sit down
there is of course no chair or anything like a chair
but behind and around him kurtzs men begin to sit on the ground cross legged
finally willard sits as well
then kurtz does
moonby lights a joint and passes it respectfully to kurtz throughout the scene the joint is passed from man to man ritualistically
slowly why did you come to
we were attacked down river
we need supplies and medical help
you were not coming here to see me
finding it more and more difficult to go on with this lie no no sir
you came up my river in that small boat
i always thought the final justice would come from the sky like we did
pause you are the final justice arent you
what do you mean colonel
gently what other reason could you have come
graduate of the recondo school
am i right about these things
you know youre right
there is a clear incredible intelligence about this man
then the agency approached you
maybe in a bar in quinon or pleiku
a years pay for one life
perhaps a village elder or a tax collector
nobodys orders but your own
he remains silent
youve spent tome at the royal tracking school of malaysia
i can tell from the way the laces on your boots are tied
i understand you captain
we understand each other
there is a long pause as the two men regard each other
then willard reaches to his holstered
withdraws it and places it on the dirt before kurtz as an act assuring kurtz that he is not an assasin
do you know me
kurtz reaches down takes the
and without another word or gesture shoots and kills a man
continuing do you know me he throws the
back on the dirt
rises and walks back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken heads
moonby scampers off after him a respectful distance behind
even willard is stunned
dotted with campfires montagnard families it is like a primitive civilization
willard is alone by a campfire his m leans by a wall next to him
he is exhausted
lance sleeps by the fire a little distance away
chef approaches crouches down
captain theyve been probed all this week cong and nva regulars
theres gonna be a big offense any time
lance stirs starts to wake up
what are we doing here
im supposed to kill him just like he said
yeah i can see that
hes fuckin nuts yeah
he killed that guy without feeling anything
not a thing
when you kill cong dont you feel something
i feel the recoil of my rifle
chef looks at him confused and frightened
willard walks along the top of a thick wall sandbagged and dug out every so often for an m or a mortar emplacement
wild looking savages man these guns and seem to bow to willard as he passes
this is good triple overlapping fields of fire walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces
a woman tentatively moves to willard bowing and then runs off to her bunker
we are tracking with them as they move past the groups of people huddled by their fires
men women and children
skulls shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut adorn every sandbagged bunker dried scalps hang from barbed wire
a child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat
continuing ive done things when i was alone in the jungle that i never told anyone about
they continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying
it has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire
the wreck lays on its side so that a
mini gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags
the emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond
some americans barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner sit near the gun
several montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets
this is evil evil captain
were all gonna die here
yeah i know
i dont get it you said your mission was to kill him
lets do it an get our asses outta here
this kurtz is ruining the war i mean this dont look good for america
lost in his thoughts hes an amazing officer
you got to kill this sonuvabitch lance and me we don t understand none of this jesus captain i dont wanna die here do it quick
lance just stands there his eyes vacant
he sort of nods sucking a joint
view from inside willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads
chef and lance with him
willard steps in lance and the chef crouch outside waiting
an austere stone savern in the temple kurtzs head quarters
electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone
we see what is left of the maps and other military charts they had been tacked up on big boards but have now fallen into decayed disuse
there are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been
now all those things are no longer impor tant
kurtz sits alone slumped back in a wicker chair
there is a large wooden planning table next to him with maps lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage
there are native decorations to ward off evil spirits and graffiti on the stone walls things ranging fromm viet nam love it or leave it to quotes of nietzsche nothing
is true everything is permitted
moonby who had been crouching in a corner moves to willard
hes asleep dont bother him
willard steps in closer
kurtz looks to moonby
moonby hesitates not wanting to leave him alone with willard
continuing suddenly i said get the fuck out
to himself im going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow
he shows some pain when moving his midsection he s only stayed alive this long because hes a good orderly and medic
he knows how to use a hypodermic
youre gonna get hit tonight bad a whole regiment of nva regulars
thats right the little gook pricks
but they are noble little gook pricks noble
because they fight with their guts like animals
and for an idea
we fight with ingenious machines and fire like gods and for nothing
but ill call in a major blotto airstrike tonight
well have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight a lightshow
how do you like the doors cmon baby light my fire
continuing do you
yeah i like it
he rests back grinning
youve gone crazy
my thinking is clear
calmly but my soul has gone mad
suddenly kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his stomach wound
he groans horribly clutching at it
he literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor
continuing my gut oh christ my gut
willard leans over him checking the seriousness of the wound
lance is crouching by the stone entrance chef leans in witnessing the proceedings inside
muttering kill him come on why dont you kill him willard examining the wound
in pain oh shit on the table morphine
willard moves to the table opens the medical packet
he takes out a morphine capsule leans over the writhing kurtz and injects him with the drug
continuing looking up in pain you see how stupid it would have been to blow out my brains
im dying from the gut anyway
willard quickly prepares another shot
kurtz truly frightened holds up his hand
continuing no i dont want to sleep
i want to think
give me water
you cant have water after morphine
still playing by the rules
almost affectionately youre a damn good kiler
still holding the second morphine hows the pain
i can handle it
pain is easy to handle but nobility
the nobility of a man is judged by how much truth he can handle
the truth that you were sent here to murder me ans so far you havent done it
and do you know why
looks at him yes you know why
he looks your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it
asshole schmuck how long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what theyre doing here
coldly except me
he rests back
the drug is beginning to take effect
continuing gimme water
you know what youre doing
you are interfering with my plans he crawls in pain toward the canteen willard watches him impassively
continuing this waters got moonbys acid in it he drinks sloppily from the canteen water spilling all over
then he throws the canteen to willard
continuing drink it drink it for tonight
think of it
a whole regiment of those shitty little cong war
total war war like youve never known it
its beautiful youll love it
we can see into the headquarters kurtz offers the canteen to willard
chef is terrified lance is stoned out
lance the fuckers not gonna do it
goddamn youve gotta dig napalm on speed too
its spectacular youll see
lance stands up holding his m looks into the cavern with chef
willard stands there holding the morphine needle in his hand
look into the jungle
you cant its too terrible
you have to smear yourself with warpaint to look at it you have to be a cannibal
whispered thats why warpaint was invented
then it becomes your jungle
willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine
how did we get here
because of all the things we do the thing we do best is lie i think think a lie stinks
oh captain that is so true
i could never figure he drinks from the canteen i could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm and not let them write the
word fuck on their airplanes
willard drinks more of the lsd water
angrily you could never figure it because it doesnt make sense
ill tell you what makes sense
air strikes white phosphorus napalm well bomb the shit out of them if they dont do what we want
well exterminate the fuckers
chef steps into the headquarters he is terrified
he draws his bayonet
captain kill him
think of it for years millions of years savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would rain down from the sky
and goddamn we made it happen
god bless dow kill him
chef rushes at kurtz with his bayonet instinctively willard guns him then there is additional automatic fire
chef is being riddled by bullets
he has let loose with his m at chef like some sort of mindless programmed killer
then hes tops chef falls to the dirt there is an instant of silence then the doors begin light my fire loud and overwhelming as illuminating flares light up the
of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of razor sharp concertina wire
light my fire is blasted out to the enemy poised to attack
cannibal painted men in savage decorations wait
bay onets are fixed
men are stoned to acid injecting speed sniffing cocaine eating grass smoking hashish in water pipes
one looks up to the sky
a rocket illuminates the sky strobing as in a psyche delic hallucination
another behind him is chanting the word napalm softly t himself
willard strides out of the darkness into the positions around the gate
he looks like a magnificent warrior genghis
all the men montagnards fierce americans even the savage men of the p
crew either bow salute or kneel before willard
the color pulsates around the edge of the image red and green mauve and purple
we see lance waiting with his weapons garlands of teeth around his neck his face painted
enemy artillery blasting away at the fortress
a hand drops a shell and it fires
explosions around the fort red and orange and blue and green
they hit and grow outward like some sort of cosmic flower
shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a death ray gun radiating outward with ice blue energy
blasting out music
with the music like those people you see listening to radios in their cars
in slow motion shells whistle in and explode on the walls in the compound
the men behind them are setting up rocket launcher missile
everywhere metal and rock and flame fly and it is beautiful to see
willard looks through the infra red sniper scope
strange luminescent images of north vietnamese approach ing the outer perimeters
thousands of them
a sergeant in feathered head piece and wildly painted operates the mini gun with several native helpers
shells burst around them
when they fire the sound is incredibly loud and steady like a high pitched foghorn
a solid stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as rounds a minute rip into the enemy
the pass of the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the ser geant sweeps the area
the sergeant laughs maniacally as the gun resumes firing right up to the moment he is blown to eternity by an all engulfing mm shell
exhilarated and moving with the music
colby pushes a row of plungers advancing nvas il luminated by napalm drums phosphorescent napalm explodes beautiful like a magnificent firework
the sound distorted of tremendous howling explosions penetrate the track of light my fire one after another
kurtzs face is illuminated by each of these
his face seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to another as though the whole history mankind is evolv ing in front of us
the screams of maimed and dismembered men almost pene trates the incredibly loud music and we hear kurtzs men laughing and screaming in delight
kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter
through wires and claymore glass each wilder and more extreme
they burn in the pools of luminescent napalm but press relentlessly on
shell bursts overhead
they chant to themselves as they advance
nva have reached the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up
suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce weird psychedelic light
blared out at tremendous vol ume over and above the din of battle is light my fire
the americans and montagnards stand up screaming
spurred by music they charge up
m s in both hands blasting kicking bayoneting gouging splittin throats biting necks both sides collide in the utter and most horrible savagery
standing on the wall blasting as bodies fall around him he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker removes it with a foot and stabs another
from him he takes his ak and blasts more as they come
the vc rush his position
willard trips a claymore that blasts most of them to shreads
more fill in
lance opens up full automatic
willard and lance move down to the nest wall firing bodies tumbling over
lance is caught in a crossfire and hit several times
he pulls himself up fires a final burst and then falls under the enemys feet
sees this and scampers off into the jungle muttering madly to himself
shouting into the radio code street gang street gang
purgative air strike street gang
he turns and runs back through the compound with the receding montagnards
shells are exploding everywhere
the light patterns are fantastic
men fall viets break over the walls and charge
they crouch and rip into them full automatic
they break the charge and continue cutting their way through the nva masses like torches through metal
kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain
women and children rush upon him now
kurtz flicks some switch es and the whole north wall explodes in overwhelming fire
the gates are uprooted
the stone lions tumble crushing men below
kurtz cocks an m and walks off the bunker
watching this spectacle
he rounds the shadow wall
kurtz sees a group of viets and rushes up and prepares a machine gun mount
they dont see him
he braces the gun at his side and steps out
they stagger and fall shattered and bleeding save one whos merely lost his weapon
kurtz looks at him his gun empty
he drops it and flips open the flap of his holster
the viet soldier goes for his pistol
kurtz beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night
he moves over to pick up the nva light machine gun
holding it at his hip he stands atop one of the ruined walls and fires into the masses
his native men see him and rush for the chance to die beside him
they are quickly encircled by onrushing viets and are being overrun
the machine gun jams and kurtz grabs a rifle
when its empty and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club
taking swings with his rifle standing atop the wall and battering the oncoming enemy like davy crockett at the alamo
the air strike hits with all its force
balls and rain of fire sweeps down on the temple the enemy everything
it is the biggest firework show in history
the wall kurtz was standing on and he falls with it
willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the air strike continues
all around us is a spectacle of music and light and fire and overwhelming color
following kurtzs trail in the mud
he has crawled on all fours back into the jungle to die
he stalks kurtz into the jungle moving around and cutting off the crawling kurtz go away hide yourself
what are you doing
going back to the jungle to die
im taking you back
you can still live
i had immense plans
im gonna get you out of here
i was on threshold of great things
willard slings kurtzs bleeding body around his neck holding his hand dragging hom through the jungle
the spectacle continues in the b
this wreck of a boat is still afloat
willard crawls out of the jungle carrying the dying kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat
the spectacle of total psychedelic war the fortress of nu mung ba
the entire temple is devastation
vultures by the hundreds circle overhead
there are a few survivors
everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies
colby a sergeant and some montagnards sit near them
their eyes are red and glazed their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally
they stagger away from the field of slaughter
willard looks down and sees something
moves over to it kicks several bodies away and in the f
below is lance dead
colby stumbles over
willard holds lance up by his hair
who is he
he was the tragedy the tragedy of this war
battered moving slowly down the river
colby is at helm
kurtz lies feverish delirious
willard sits by him
as the boat moves montagnards those left alive come and pay their respects by the riverbanks
colby takes an automatic weapon and fires it into the air
some of the natives move in terror frightened of him
the battle is not over
dont frighten them away
willard looks down at him
so you understand this
kurtz looks up at him past him with fury longing in his eyes
there is a slight smile
do i not
the boat moves as though naturally carried by the river
he looks at willard my death
you had immense plans
im taking you back
kurtz looks up to him then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror hopeless despair
a whisper at some image at some vision he cries out twice a cry that is no more than a breath
the horror the horror
we hear the distant sound of helicopters approaching
the sound of rotors in the distance
they look up craning their eyes at the sky
over the jungle mountains the small formation of medevac helicopters hooping toward them
continuing how did they know
they must have seen the fire
the helicopters are closer now but high up
two of them breaking off spiraling in toward us
theyre coming to rescue us
he stares up at the sky
to himself theyre coming to take us back
copters directly overhead
colonel kurtz hes dead
he raises his m and fires the entire clip at the ap proaching rescue helicopter
it frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the sky
colby takes his rifle and joins willard in firing at the retreating american helicopters
the men in the boat firing at us as we fly further into the air the boat getting smaller and smaller
dont remember a lot about my rehabilitation
but i was sent back to the world before the fall of saigon
moving down back to the pleasure boat at the marina
willard is very silent
i never answered questions about kurtz i gave them a few of his unimportant papers but for the most part i saved everything
there were other letters personal ones written earlier to his wife
i brought them to het
i watched the fall of saigon on television in a bar in alameda
a bright clear day in a scrubbed clean california neigh borhood
some kids are playing in the street
willard years later dressed as a civilian proceeds past the lawn to the attractive home carrying a packet under his arm
he passes a lanky young teen aged boy working on a motor scooter
willard looks at him
the boy looks back
then the door opens and kurtzs wife is standing at the door
she is still beautiful blonde and dressed in mourning even though she doesnt wear black
there is a sense of purity about her though she is not young
come in captain willard
everything good and secure and desirable about america
she stands in the center of the room a little nervous
can i get anything for you
there are pictures of kurtz not too many
but he is there in the various stages of his career
then she sits suddenly and willard sits by her
continuing did you know him very well
you get to know each other pretty well out there
and you admired him
he was a remarkable man
it was impossible not to love him
yes it is true
thats the hard part for me
i knew him better than anyone
i knew him best
you knew him best
you were his friend
you must have been if he had given you this
the packet if he sent you to his home
he was the best this country had he was yes i know
ill never get over it but ill always remember him
both of us
men looked up to him
she loses herself in a thought he died as he lived
his death was yes he died as he lived
were you with him when
yes i was
he said his last words to me
a little of the madness is still with him
he knows what she will ask
what were they
remembering that incredible day moving down the river
our view loosens tell me what he said
he spoke of you maam
he sits there looking at her
the cocktail party is breaking up
willard is one of the few guests left
we move from willard standing alone on the deck of the boat
moving back through the departing guests
charlie is getting ready to leave himself
we move closer to willard
the boat floating down the river
kurtzs body an exhaust ed half dead colby
and holding kurtz willard
we hear the doors the end as we present the end titles
