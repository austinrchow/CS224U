screenplay by james l
brooks the camera briskly retreats as forty highly charged attractive young people march towards it
each side of the frame is black as this troupe of young actors moves up the middle everyone talking grinning squealing
everyone having the high of their lives
as the troupe with geometric precision spills into a large room containing a raised dance floor the camera begins to move past dancing couples as a legend appears this is
and matt hobbs is singled out for the first time
and now the camera reveals matt hobbs
his open friendly american face slips between some of the many cracks in his profession
the face at and forever more not arresting enough for a leading man not quirky enough for a character
matt must briefly walk on the dance floor to make his way past a knot of people
he dances furiously for two seconds then steps down as the dancers begin to sing wow but just as the song breaks out musically we hear the sound of people
shhhing the singers falter and then stop as the party goers gather in choreographed movement at a ceiling mounted tv set
we can barely discern the words
with his review is leonard graff
a frantic actress yelps a command i cant hear over this shhing
silence then a play about guess what
thats right young people
he stands next to a ruggedly handsome and extremely nauseous i cant look
good idea lets not
he begins to walk the handsome contemporary falling into step
everyone they pass is straining upwards at the tv
how can we not listen to this
well know all we need to from the reaction
at that moment the rest of the party goers turn from the tv as one looking mugged
one girl briefly gets our attention because she is particularly distraught tears streaming down her angry face
the mixture of tears and rage are of course the chemical components of incredible sexiness
her name is beth
a tortured male dancer offers an incantation
he should be shot he should be dead he should rot in hell then come back as the soap cake in a urinal
to dancer he didnt like it
the director moves through the group bucking up spirits
he doesnt count
well just wait for the papers
as they morosely watch the director approach
hey no matter what this review says the play was a great experience for me
beth looks at him puzzled
again i mean it is about process right
good lord it is what were alive for
beth turns from the conversation finding it preposterous then rivets her attention on the director walking towards them holding a ridiculously thick sheaf of papers
beth begins to sob in anticipation
youve just got to be tougher than this
incredulous tougher than this
the director reaches them
i took it all down over the phone
its quite bad
and unfortunately its very very long
ive got a broken heart and writers cramp
he savages everyone
i dont want to hear anymore
except you matt
they all look at him
fiercely to matt you filthy bastard
drawing closer to matt what did he say
the director hunts for the paragraph
dont read it
you cant wait to run out of here buy a flashlight and then go into some dark alley and drool over every word
truthfully youre wrong
im maybe relieved and curious
wildly exasperated what did they say about him
reading in the midst of this delirium of pretension
this divisive crap wont
one actor rather miraculously manages to provide passion and yes truth
matt hobbs in the supporting role of jesus manages to touch the heart long after you thought it numbed by boredom
the table of actors look at a sober matt
a long beat and then against his will he grins
then a short involuntary barking laugh of joy
then to his colleagues with sincerity sorry
as we hear the next lines of wow begin main titles as the camera booms up to the outside of a small apartment as a legend appears on screen beth
now is standing in front of a tv set showing the emmy dancers performing a phrase of wow
she screams out
will you get in here for gods sake
matt is on the phone
into phone come on ma how could i show up tonight when my union is boycotting the emmys
look i have to hang up
screaming voice its on right now
right this second
you will miss it
into phone i gotta go
matt hangs up and tear asses into the living room
beth screams as his name is read
on tv and matt hobbs for caine mutiny court martial
and the winner is powers boothe for jonestown story of a massacre
he was good
look he even showed up
that took courage
i wonder if they send you something for just being nominated
of all the pathetic questions
sharply why are you being so damn foul
beth glares at him on the verge of taking him on but he is looking at her very directly
the lack of any other agenda giving him a temporary edge
beth decides to state the unadorned truth
weve been going back and forth on our status for so long
i was hoping that if you won it might mean something for us
she is waving her hand in a circle
he is puzzled
please go fast
i cant take you dragging it out
a bit faster the only reason i havent
i promised myself i wouldnt be so bossy
take your time
was that bossy too
persisting the only thing i have against getting married is that it might not be fair because im going to stay with acting forever and you know how erratic the
moneys been and theres no resolve
do i get to vote
im going to tell you something i never told you before
your feeling towards your work is one of the things i love most about you
maybe the most
hey then we have no problem here
they kiss then break murmuring to each other
stinker i almost gave up on you
i was just worried whether i could make you happy
a set frame showing several clusters of waiting people
a man rushes to one of these clusters cueing this group to sing the next phrase of wow
as an extremely hyper matt enters the song stops and a legend appears extremely hyper everythings okay
shes six or eight pounds even
nothing like it
ill tell you something amazing
they really reach right into her stomach and pull out this baby
its not just a rumor
i understand the expression mind blowing for the first time
it means something so wonderful happens that the top of your head comes off and your brain pops out
part of it was terrifying the baby was turned and they couldnt budge her
i kept looking at this one woman doctors eyes
and when jeannie finally came out this doctor and i each wiped away a tear at the exact same time caught ourselves doing it and then laughed together at the
nothing can prepare you for it
you know why youre alive
as matt walks with pep accompanied by a burst of wow
beth holds baby jeannie and wears a scowl
how you doing
my mother said you were flirting with the doctor during the delivery
on matts expression
matt and beth lie on an open sofa bed
wow is completed though with a dirge like cadence
we hear a baby crying over a cheap walky talky near their bed
could you get her honey
i have that big reading tomorrow
no i have a lot to do tomorrow too
i have to borrow on our christmas club i have to
dont worry about money anymore
on her look i didnt want to tell you because it may sound a little strange when i say it out loud
you know me im never that cocky
but im going to get spider woman
its me or raul and ive never been so sure
its weird but i just know it
broadly boy am i reassured
what good news
isnt that a load off
where we see the crying baby holding the walky talky in front of its mouth as it screams into the mouthpiece
i am gonna get this part beth
i cant stand this anymore
its an awful place
the start up apartment hes way too old for
but we dont yet see his humble quarters
rather then the screen is cleared on one half so we see half of a contact lens holder in focus the other half blurred until matt gets his second contact
a tube of tooth bleach
close on the directions then bleaching his teeth
smiling in the mirror
this is the bleached smile of fear true fear the awful state of having lost your way
the phone rings
matt clears his voice before answering
into phone hello
im glad you finally returned my call
what are you so mad about
again into phone matt was so suddenly emotionally extended that the anger leaves him that quickly
just a strange atypical lightning bolt of rage toward life and women
again into phone you know what
im being a sort of gutless wonder here
im yelling back at you because im embarrassed
i wont be able to take the kid when i said
why dont you listen for a second
he rubs his head with both hands including the one holding the phone
this allows us to hear his ex wife repeat the same sentence over and over again
from phone youre taking her
youre taking her
youre taking her
beth i know exactly how long its been and i feel strange as hell not seeing her but this isnt a choice
its the driest spell of my life
im not saying its your problem but its no place for a six year old
what can i do
the only full time job i seem to have is not showing how scared i am
no thats not something i said before
accepting compliment well thanks
beth turns angry again
matt finds unfortunately that hes got one more act of bravado left
again into phone beth hey
never mind ill do it
he hangs up
again to himself i must get work
i will take anything
i must get work
i must not be embarrassed by these pep talks to myself
as matt walks from the outdoor parking lot past inexpensive homes
in the lot on private lawns and every public bench at each street corner are various actors doing the relaxation exercises which will form the basis of a dance as
they go over their sides
feathers im blowing
what am i a duck
we pass various actors going over alternate sentences for the same speech so that we get a sense of the speech as a whole from the sum of its parts
im not thinking about whether im going to shoot you
trying to decide where
the little spot behind the ear where you die before you hear the shot
on the left side of the belly which is a very mean place
an office building of clear architectural merit located in an industrial area
even the sign popcorn pictures has all the artistic dignity the name itself lacks
gradually movement becomes choreographed
the young actor and actress running across the street do so with uncommon grace
the area matt passes is very crowded and we still havent reached the most congested area of all as we study faces and hear snatches of the actors preparation
what am i a duck
sure ill tell you
do a nice middle aged lady a favor
a fair trade
tell you what you want to know in return for a
grimaces over dialogue she must say a pity fu
music becoming more insistent as we approach the building the mumbling of the actors taking on the sound of a wailing wall
the height of ego
you think your he manness can make me get on that elevator even though im phobic
i cant get on that elevator
i dont care if
they catch us
do you cant
singing the dialogue
cant get on the elevator
cant get on the elevator
even if you make me
even if you make me
do you get it
do you get it
standing near each other exchange glares as they break each others concentration and move apart
their movement serving as our gateway to dancing
the song make believe enters fully now and builds in intensity reaching a repeated phrase as we move to matt and he enters the building thereby cutting off the song
as the song continues in intensity matt enters the building at the end of a repeated phrase cutting off the song as we move to where cathy breslow age waits
hollywood is a bit of an uphill struggle for cathy
she is bright where others are brilliant pretty where others are gorgeous enormously hard working where others are obsessive compulsive
she is clearly waiting for someone while reading an enormously thick book galley
matt almost scoots by her then stops
see i did recognize you
you didnt have to wait for me
well i wanted to introduce you
as if knowing me would help
staircase packed with actors an uphill slalom almost impossible to navigate
its a ridiculously awful movie
i wasnt sure youd remember me
let alone help
im doing them a favor by getting you in
well thats a fresh slant
they reach the casting assistant claire
claire this is matt hobbs
as matt is handed a set of sides we shoot past matt as he watches cathy move back down the stairs before he can say another word
she moves with wit
he is struck by her
he looks back at claire who has an intricate hairdo and a ready smile
were running behind
please forgive us
her hairdo wilted her blouse soiled her smile gone the tendons of her neck prominent
fiercely matt hobbs
going over his lines
hearing his name he rises
claire gestures him in
the walls are pockmarked with movie posters
three men sit in an area some distance from the desk
the casting director martin makes the introduction this is matt hobbs
this is john earl mcalpine the director
good to see you
he speaks with an australian accent gets half up and extends his hand
and burke adler the producer
so what have you been doing with yourself
checking resume the last few years
to burke im real bad at interviews so if you dont mind id really prefer to just read first
thats the way you want to do it
maybe we shouldnt even read
ill just take your word that youre good
theres all different ways
did you know woody allen never reads actors
he just looks at them feels around a little and then decides who he wants
thats his way
doesnt hear them do a line
i also have a way
what i do is interview first then read maybe do it all over again the next day
i call up people the actor has worked with check him out
if hes famous i do an opinion survey to test how much people like him
if hes not famous i put him on tape and show it to everyone i can grab
i believe in screen tests i believe in replacing if the dailies are bad in cutting people out if the previews arent there
because im not doing movies for theaters where they serve cappucino in the lobby
im doing popcorn movies
you want to know what i like
come to my house look at my lamps
you wont find it in my movies
in my movies youll find out what i know
i know how to do detail
what i dont know i discover
yesterday we finished mixing a movie the last scene is in a field of windmills which blows up and all the blades of these windmills slice through the air one
of which hits a four story tank of propane gas
a humongous explosion scene
i kept on saying louder and they finally said to me they couldnt go louder without distortion
we went louder
we had to discover a thing a filter but we went louder
i dont question doing these things
i do them
so if you want to know if its okay to do it differently not to talk to just read first
pointing to john earl ask him hes the director
okay lets do it
do you have any questions
they only gave me these two pages
id like to give this my best shot
so if i could read the script and come back
this part works tomorrow
who will i be reading with
burke indicates martin
from his chair can i read from here
i want you to do it wherever youre comfortable but id prefer it if you were comfortable standing up
matt rises uncomfortably
a secretary enters and hands a note to the director
time for my buns to have visitors
matt looks astonished as the director leaves the room
to matt go ahead
the director left
thats okay he trusts me uh
and were just doing the first page
cueing him badly okay darling harry here it is
if someone were breaking up with me id like it short and sweet
what about you
reading showing pain incredibly drawn out
i cant take care of you right now
what am i your mother
intense well what am i
as he gets into the scene he begins to experience some release of the desperate feelings hes been harboring
again weve been together two years and you act like all youre doing is blowing away some feathers
so what im asking
you didnt do the quack
the stage direction says for him to quack
i know but why would he quack when someones breaking up with him
hopefully because its funny
this isnt a comedy
then were in trouble because theyre already fall down laughing at the teaser trailer in fifty two hundred and thirty theaters
rubbing his face i think i have to make an adjustment here
we hear the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming from cathys cassette player
a rack of soundtracks clearly visible
cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley pages
she overhears some conversation in the adjoining room which begins to disturb her concentration
im not supposed to read tv pilots
dont call us d girls
were development persons
cathy closes the door shutting her off
she now begins to fill out a form with a felt tipped pen
as she does so the pad is supered on the screen action seen through it
as she writes we see the notations on the super
it is marked coverage confidential from cathy breslow
to burke adler
subject the pen writes out little dick genre category the pen writes out action adventure
then there are columns to check excellent good fair poor for the story
the pen checks fair for story poor for all else character dialogue etc
the form then states check one of the following sentences the phone rings
as she picks it up and reaches to turn down the volume of the motion picture soundtrack shes listening to
into phone hi
i just finished
ill have my coverage right over
its past derivative
what a hoot
youre kidding right
there is truly active bidding for this book
okay see you
she hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the story poor to story excellent and all the other poors to good
and now the recommend section
the pen is poised
her soul is poised
a beat and she allows i do not recommend to stand the source music theme chariots of fire coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism
cathy takes the sheet and walks to the door
as she approaches her secretarys desk she overhears two other members of burkes development staff a year old well dressed man and a woman younger than cathy as they enthuse
even the title little dick it means so many things
story story story story story
seeing cathy you loved it right
i had some problems
well you know its a little garbagey
so it has to be cast right
if cathy doesnt like it we know its a smash
its not like i didnt recommend it
she surreptitiously changes her recommend as matt enters
she looks up
howd it go
i didnt get it
he did say something about wanting me back
his saver is he means what he says
yeah i just wanted to say thanks
she nods and starts to turn back towards her office
and i wanted to ask you out
the other people in the office stare at matt
turns for when
i never know when im free
matt nods it sounds like im just
but its true
i felt funny asking
well dont please
i meant asking you to get me the audition
well dont please
he nods and starts to go
she looks at him
dont be sad
matt smiles in astonishment and exits
who is he
oh i was auditing this acting course and he filled in teaching one night
he did a scene himself and he was awesome
for some reason he cant get arrested
he does seem to have a layer of loser dust on him
matt drives his faded seven year old car into view
he looks off
sees something that arrests his interest and pulls to the curb
its a curious sight
burke adler standing at a street corner palpably in pain
hes trying to rein in his emotions sucking in huge gulps of air
and then a wave of emotion gets the better of him as he looks at his watch
a sob escapes him shocked that hes so close to tears on a public street corner he battles for control
another sob as he looks to the heavens
a split second to consider then hes out of his car
a flow of people in the foreground the tortured figure of burke adler in the background matt hobbs pauses before intruding
but burkes spectacle is growing more public sounds of anguish escape him
louder what am i going to do
and now he begins to dissassemble openly crying on the verge of a complete breakdown
matt moves into frame grabbing burke trying to provide him with an anchor
his face his eyes providing a beacon of strength
totally fucked up wild eyed
as he witnesses his own state
look at me
youd think i was a writer
his story of travail pours from him i hired this kid as a production assistant
his fathers a business manager
a few good clients
hes been driving for me two weeks
all he has to do is pick me up on time
hes twenty minutes late and i have a test screening in the valley
everybodys gone from the office
burke flails at himself as matt looks at him
is that it
you need a lift
im right over here
matt starts to lead him back then realizes hes alone burke having seen his car finally arrive
burke berating the young driver
matt pauses awed by the wild gesticulating the few screamed words
not just today
believe me theres no way youll ever make it
you are going to fail
listen listen i know about this you are going to be a failure
as he joins burke and the young man burke turns to matt
to matt lets get moving you said youd give me a lift
what the hell are you talking about
not in your car
ive got my own
ill give you a hundred and twenty dollars to take me
and it will still be a favor
to young man get out
to matt please
this is very important
the driver gets out
final plea a guy got shot on the freeway
traffics tied up
you should leave time for that kind of thing
what do you need me for
dont you drive
a mumble yeah i drive
i dont like to look for parking
the sun setting on a nondescript slab of california
the two men
matt feeling very peculiar in this line of work
burkes tension renders him arresting handsome even
the look of generals who go forth against long odds
he takes an enormous cleansing breath
it startles matt
explaining yoga shit
i feel like barbed wire
i dont know if you keep track but im the sixth independent producer ever to have two big pictures scheduled for christmas and tonight were testing the first one for
the first time
you get it
its important to you
laughing at the understatement yes
i dont think i would have put it that way
burkes car moves toward the movie complex
our first view of nan mulhanney middle aged and pragmatic yet extraordinarily naive
shes a scientist of sorts monitoring the tastes and feelings of americans first in washington and now here
though she just had a very rough hour or so she bends down to smile at burke
she runs the test screenings
she has a real case on me but so far ive been keeping it in the bank
he stops talking stops breathing as he sees
the line consists of disparate disinterested people who are focused on their own small personal dramas not at all cognizant of the fact that they hold a life in their
they are clearly growing impatient
go very slow
burke steels himself and exits the car
were minutes late
the studio is appropriately wild
people are beginning to leave
but i knew how upset youd be if we started without you
but he pays her no mind as music continues and he moves towards the line
nan approaches the car
how is he tonight
i dont know him so i have nothing to compare it to
well how would you say he is anyway
not quite himself
as he approaches the line he begins to sing his love to them ill do anything
as he pours out his misdirected heart to individuals on the line who do not hear him
their impatience gives rise to a very slow tap dance each couple or cluster doing it differently barely exaggerating the normal shifting of a line
as burke continues to sing
the song builds as does the dance
burke sings even more passionately his d people perhaps joining in as background singers
at a key point the disparate groups turn and form a solid unified line
they begin the rhythmic clapping of impatience having become a line they now threaten to become a mob
burke sings one more joe cocker like passionate plea before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem let them in
as they enter
nan is addressing the audience from down front
the name of the picture youll be seeing is ground zero
there may be some scratches
some of the colors may be off there are no final titles and it has not been finally mixed for sound and the music is temp that means temporary
as she says this where burke spies the studio head and leaves matts side
as burke enters the frame behind him
he is right behind his boss ear
he leans in and offers an intimacy
im glad you came yourself instead of sending your staff
the boss is startled jumps
burke eyes him
there must be some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful man
i wouldnt be surprised if tonights screening is a monster
emphatically could happen right
he moves back to matt and nan at the rear of the audience
to matt eisner just said he thinks the screening will be a monster
strangely burke seems truly buoyed by the words of encouragement he himself manufactured
he moves down three rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a series of violent explosions
please god let tonight give him peace
incredibly burke turns and gestures to her that the sound of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his movie
nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers to matt
were short two card counters can you two help out
we are seeing one of the final moments of the film
as the muscular hero moves with stealth through the giant refrigerated meat door
he passes cows and dead men hanging from alternate hooks
suddenly he is attacked by the villain brandishing an electric meat dismembering tool
the hero ducks the machine ripping apart hanging cow flesh
the hero grabs the only weapon he can find a large piece of meat on a large bone which he uses as a mace
he clubs the other man then again and again
part of the audience is whooping and applauding
standing with matt and cathy
at the sound of the applause nan grins and mumbles with a connoisseurs knowledge
males fifteen and under
where the hero stands over the man whose face he has shattered holding a club from which hang strings of meat
he is breathing heavily and between breaths states sorry to bust your chops
general audience laughter
if youll just stay in your seats a few moments and fill out these cards for us
matt and others handing out cards with pencils attached
folks filling them out
as an adolescent male fills it out preview card fills the screen as we view live action through an office meant for two containing twenty counters
the counting is done with erasers rifling stacks creating a sound a musical rhythm as the group captain calls out with gospel cadence
who has young males
matt his tally finished squats on the floor waiting
the group captain approaches
matt looks blank
again older males
matt now realizes that it is his category and hands over the older male cards and exits
burke prowling the lobby as audience stragglers leave and studio execs and popcorn development staff wait
he looks off to see matt and nan chatting in another part of the lobby
as they arrive
nan looks off to see the group captain approach
how long since youve seen your daughter
a little over two years
on her look my wife insisted on moving back to the midwest then i was in the philippines on the mini series and
suddenly and loudly oh please
its one thing being a son of a bitch but you dont have to be a stupid son of a bitch
people move heaven and earth to see their kids
i dont care if she moved to pluto its abandonment
a pause then hey we just met
make a guess how we did
it wouldnt mean anything
nothing good that happens can make it worth feeling the way i do now
an older woman approaches them
who the hell are you
this is private
can i get you some water
no thank you
the group captain approaches and hands nan a sheet
everyone all the studio and popcorn staff is drawn to nan
as she glances at the figures
as she secretly reaches for and holds burkes hand
is it in sympathy or congratulations
as we see in ever so slowed actions tense lips turning gloriously upward to reveal gums then a smile
more smiles as we pan across teeth
bonded executives and bonded teeth
the shot widens
the studio head mumbles to himself as he carefully goes over the tally in every category
then i dont need the numbers
i loved it
his smiling face takes us burke ninety in the top two boxes
a tear in his eye a smile shyer than others
he turns to the old lady instinctively using this victory to settle his most recent score as he says mockingly now can i get you some water
cathy and matt are leaning against burkes car
cathy is distraught temporarily but horribly unsure of herself
matt is looking at her
if he had a little more confidence going for him right now he would make his move
but for now they are two self doubters on different trips
i never thought it would do this well
there were so many holes i told everybody it wasnt going to do business
why am i so public with my opinions
you might be right
not with that score
you know maybe tonights the night im losing my entire mind but werent you in platoon
i was only there for a minute in the rape scene moving past charlie sheen when i left the hut
i had a great scene cut out
but there was that one long close up where you seemed ashamed of yourself but still arrogant
thats exactly what i was going for
it reminded me of my last boyfriend
indicating book bag got to go
she hefts the bag puts it back down crosses her eyes burlesquing the weight of the bag
he helps her put it on her shoulder
you have to read all that
beast of burden
sincerely so what are you totally wonderful or what
she smiles and is gone staggering a bit under the weight of her scripts
matt looks after her
burke and nan approach
how come you havent said anything
this is great right
the definite recommends are way off for a score this high and even for action adventure its just too low for women
burke looks anguished im sorry
he leans against the car for support
it was such a good score
extraordinarily sympathetic i know
and unfortunately yesterdays tracking wasnt
he reacts im sorry
they just dont seem in the mood for action adventure right
he reacts sorry
may i tell you one more thing
he looks up in anticipatory fear i think its so wonderful that you dont worry about even trying to act strong
you want to eat something sometime
im blushing from head to foot
ill call you
as burke moves to his car
he sees the group captain paying matt
thirty two thirty three
burke is looking at matt with some surprise
you want to do this regularly for me
i was gonna offer but i thought it would humiliate you
straight at him i dont mind an occasional odd job
but i cant work tomorrow
i have to get my kid
as they get in the car burke has the front door open about to get in reconsiders and gets in the rear door
okay i got the cards to look at i think ill ride back here
to nan maybe ill drop by your place tomorrow
matt gets behind the wheel thereby ending the day as a full fledged chauffeur
they drive off
burke and nan returning from lunch
so thanks for lunch
i hope this leads to an evening date
though i have to stay home with my daughter leslie on saturdays
sincerely yeah okay
you were very interesting to talk to
i swear to god
you really were
i believe you
sincerely and i was very surprised what you were like when you werent working
there was absolutely no difference
you want to see where we do the tracking
excited is it okay
the enter the room containing a maze of telephone cubbies with workers manning the phones
nobody ever wants to see how we do the polling but theyre like little starved puppies when the data comes in running at you scrambling to
burke hardly hears
he is awed as if by a cathedral
how often do you go to the movies
im going to describe a movie in one sentence and then ask you to rate it on a scale of
as the workers continue i love this
this is what counts and this is where you count it
soft and true thats the same way i feel
you phone all over you know what movies theyre waiting to see whether your tv spots are working
you know what the country thinks
what feelings do you have about cher as a singer an actress or potential date
again and its accurate
within six point eight percent
and you cant fix it
sometimes just for myself i cant resist asking america a personal question
simply when do you feel more worthless mornings or afternoons
i gotta get back
they pause by a workers to say goodbye
assume michelle pfeiffer is the woman which of these actors would you most like to see her with
patrick swayze keanu reeves dustin hoffman johnny dep the guy from major dad
theres something i meant to tell you
you may have noticed something unusual about me
i gotta get back
i could never find the right time to
is this urgent
well maybe not urgent but immediately significant and necessary to tell
a deep breath you see theres these pills
cause i gotta go
im listening with an eighth of an ear now
he exits as the telephone pollster continues with the list of prospective michelle pfeiffer male co stars
matt wearing earphones is in the middle of a row of five intent on what he is watching
a recent example of a great actor in a regular movie
something like brando in the freshman
not watching studying
not studying fully appreciating
now he sees a particularly good moment looks around joyously for half a beat a reflex to share what he saw
his neighbors not quite knowing what hes smiling at he returns his attention to the screen
as matts cab pulls up
he opens the front gate and walks up to the porch noting a tricycle stirred by old guilts
he knocks on the door
a man answers
are you matt
i didnt know if we could wait much longer
come on in
he lights a cigarette takes three quick drags then flicks it away before walking inside behind matt
again shes a real nut on smoking anywhere near the kid
a bedroom down a narrow hallway from where they stand
remember the best years of our lives
frederic march coming home from the wars and seeing his wife just a beat before she sees him
here we have a wretched mutant of that moment
beth still fierce and attractive is packing her daughters suitcase when she senses him and looks up
shaking her head with a disapproval which will never die she walks to him
hello did you two meet
is she ready
i have the taxi waiting
i just have to say goodbye
you have no idea how difficult that is
its three weeks
its not three weeks
yes it is
no its not
several beats beth and the man staring at matt
he doesnt know
you are not taking her for a visit
you are taking her for a while
just because you want to go off with him doesnt mean i
youre getting the wrong idea
i dont think so
no matter how you put this
hey look im a united states marshal
im here because she didnt show up yesterday to start serving her time
i dont have a choice
you dont have a choice
she turns and starts for the other room
what did she do
turning i loved helped and supported in every possible way a business man who committed the terrible crime of being financially imaginative with a pension fund
he sits down stunned in the headlights of his fate
matt and the marshal in the foreground as beth talks to jeannie in the background
we see only glimpses of them
beths face as she leans towards jeannie from one side of the doorway just jeannies legs dangling on the other side
okay listen carefully jeannie
now whats the most important thing in life to know
no one will ever love me as much as you do
matt and the marshal exchange a look of mutual horror
now concentrate with all your muscles and remember everything im about to say to you
the marshal and matt shift uncomfortably
dont talk to strangers
they may be killers
take your vitamins so the poison in the food cant hurt you
what else now
brush right after you eat or your gums will start to bleed in your sleep and choke you
the marshal and matt can stand no more they each call to her
she looks out and then walks to them
im giving jeannie her reminders
you cant say things like that to a little
dont criticize the way i mother or i think ill start to scream and never st
suddenly cheery yes
you know ive been involved with this sort of thing for a long time
youre not going to criticize me are you
not in front of him because all hes done is send jeannie these long stupid letters
he doesnt even realize she cant read
he sends letters to someone who cant read
laughs its almost funny
i thought youd read them to her
im not faulting you
you love your daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through
you feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that theres so much important stuff going down that theres no sure way of dealing with it but
the best thing you can do is just make sure you love her
typical cop talk
on his look but i understand what youre trying to say
can i have another minute with her
she returns to the doorway which still only provides us with glimpses as she sings dont talk to strangers
the camera moves down the hallway to introduce jeannie trying to puzzle things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of suitcases
as the two females who bear his name approach
matt doesnt want a pregnant first moment with jeannie so he wards off silence with chatter
unfortunately he can only think of one word
hi hi hi hi hi hi
laughing mirthlessly hello monster poop
marshal she has her mothers sense of humor
beth stops him with a look then bends down
okay love mommys going to help others who need her for a few years and youre going with daddy as i explained
to marshal and matt well all have to help with the luggage
all three adults and jeannie sharing the burden of the luggage as they move towards the cab
mother and child hug
matt struck by his childs plight him
turning to matt beginning now you must give less value to your own happiness and well being then hopefully you will reach the point where you give that no value
give her everything
theres no such thing as spoiling a child
even if you have to steal to do it
you dont really want to mess with me do you
simple honesty no
to jeannie okay sweetie
we have to go
to beth i want to go with you
cant pretty heart
tears fall from jeannies eyes
not even a compromise
thinking the compromise will be that you dont have to ride in back you can ride up front with the driver
as beth buckles jeannie into the front seat matt gets in the back alone feeling preposterous
beth nods to the marshal who surreptitiously handcuffs her
to driver can we please go
the cab pulls away
matt leans towards her as she looks back at the receding figure of her mother and grows still
as she sings him one last line of dont talk to strangers
matt checks jeannies luggage then takes her hand
she lets him
he is grateful
its going to be okay
im youre dad you know
so it will be okay
you and i will make it okay
you ever ridden in a plane before
a sudden gust of anger yesssss
jeannie and matt in the center two seats of a five seat row
jeannie is coloring in a book which matt bought her he is holding some extra crayons
dont stare at me
i want to put on my yellow dress now
its underneath the plane
we cant get it
and just that quick jeannie screams
i want to put on my dress
i want to put on my dress
other passengers turn around
this is pretty raw stuff were into
temper in all its wildness music under
electric guitar beginning to match the energy and naked emotion of the child
theres no way we can get the dress its impossible
jeannies feet start kicking in front of her the person in that seat turning sharply around
dont kick the seat
i want the yellow dress
a shriek give me a compromise
she is crying now
as soon as we land
thats the compromise
without warning jeannie slaps herself in the face
all five people in the row ahead turn and say in unison dont hit her
god i didnt hit her she hit her
as everyone starts pushing the cabin attendant call button
these dings magnify until theyre part of the music as it drives and drives
matt takes jeannies hand and tries to restrain her
let go of me
the yellow dress
she breaks away from him
he moves after her
at breakneck speed jeannie dashes through the plane with her father in pursuit
flashes of disapproving faces
the seat belt sign goes on
a flight attendant blocks his path
youll have to sit down
jeannie takes advantage of matts being stopped and moves into the toilet locking the door behind her
yelling jeannie we have to sit down
well be having some turbulence for the next twenty minutes or so
will the cabin attendants please take their seats
simply and utterly i have no idea what to do
a sudden bump and matt falls
he yells to the locked door
jeannie you okay
go back to your seat
ill get her
as matt makes his way back the flight attendant uses a hidden latch to open the door
music building then calming the worst is over
matt makes his way back to his seat shell shocked
the attendant leans over him
she wants to be alone
so were upgrading her
he just nods
down the aisle jeannie lets an attendant lead her as she peers back at her dad
matt carrying the sleeping child like a sack over his shoulder also managing to hold onto all her luggage
he has propped her on the sofa a cotton nightgown out
he is unbuttoning her dress
she opens her eyes the windows protective bars placing a shadow across her face
she attempts to cover her fear
these are the wrong jammies
so what do we do
jeannie mimics him perfectly under her breath
she goes to an open suitcase and throws things on the floor until she finds the right jammies
where do i sleep
i have a sleeping bag and bed
which one do you want
she surveys her pitiful choice then points to the sleeping bag
she gets into it
he zips her up then she says something remarkably unexpected
amazed matt hugs her
a half beat then sharply let go
he does then stands and looks down at her
she looks back mocking his stare with one of her own
nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom
she is wearing an evening gown
the sun streams through the lush foliage outside a wall sized window
music as she opens her purse and removes a pillbox at one point lightly singing a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single woman and a single
mother this while totally focused on the pills
a major movie shot of this compartmentalized box
each burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains music continues
she dials a phone number while arching her neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs of water
this process continuing even as she speaks into the phone
monica is leslie up yet
i didnt want you to get worried when you realized i wasnt there
im still with that man
ill tell you about it later
but its sure nice to have wobbly legs again
look todays recycling day for leslie at school so give her some empty cans
well then dump some out for her
tell her i had to leave real early for work and ill pick her up at school myself to make up for it and well rent any cassette she wants
take good care
she hangs up
another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush her teeth with her finger prepares herself and opens the door to greet her new lover
burke sits on the edge of the bed fearful
he sees her
oh i thought you took off in the middle of the night
she moves quickly to him
i just had to call home
is that why youre sad
this kid who used to work for me
he was always crazy to do his own movie
fearing worst what happened
very down his movie not only opened to a three million dollar friday its gotten great reviews
nan is dumbfounded still she puts a hand on him actually consoling him for his hideous thought hollywood lovers he wrapped up with ill thoughts of others she feeling intimate
yet severely compromised
cupids work is done
im tremendously worried about ground zero because of the bad want to sees you sent over
but thats just me being nervous over nothing isnt it
thats just you correctly assessing the situation
so stop being so hard on yourself
he eyes her then we hear a muffled argument between matt and jeannie coming from inside their apartment
then the door opens and matt holding jeannie by the hand moves down the hall to the next door and knocks
note jeannie is dressed in layers of varied clothing some of the layers play clothes some fit for a coronation
she is a pocket contemporary annie hall
her style so much her own it transcends judgement
her hair is unkempt
the door opens revealing lucy an hispanic woman in her mid s
howre you doing
im from next door
i see you with your kids in the laundry room
seeing jeannie turns warmer who are you
jeannie is a bit shy
say hello im your new neighbor now too
jeannie says nothing
im lucy crisala
whats your name
jeannie says nothing
the form of the conversation is forged
jeannie not answering anything
matt bending over to jeannie while he forms her answers to lucy
i have a little girl too
say isnt that nice
how old is she
shes four and a half and i have a little boy who is not yet one year
say thats nice
id like to play with them
my daddy didnt know your phone number so we just decided to
interrupting what can i do for you
say daddy has to go to work tonight and
catching himself and looks directly at lucy i need someone to help me and her on short notice
ive seen your around with your kids and hoped you knew someone in the building or close by
ive got this new job that starts now
do you know anyone
well im always here
i could maybe do it myself
there is a god and a good one at that oh this is so great
lets work out a full time schedule and
jeannie why dont you come in for a minute and meet ricky and essa
come on were making fruit bars
jeannie walks into the apartment past her father
again to matt why dont you leave her for a while and then we talk
sort of a test
well just see how it works
play pen in the middle of the floor
jeannie stands there staring at essa who is playing with her little brother
matt moves to embrace jeannie who cranes away from him
he stays with it whispering in her ear
please behave understand
i dont know what well do if this doesnt work so behave sweetheart
as he exits towards his own apartment
matt is extraordinarily anxious
then he hears loud crying and screaming from next door
there is a stab of despair
matt deflates then resigned exits
the sound of screaming now louder
he walks to lucys door takes a breath and knocks
the door opens and lucy stands there looking rattled
im sorry i bothered you
calling inside jeannie
could i have her a little bit longer
my little boy just fell and jeannie is the only one he let hold him
a devils weight lifted from his shoulders
the slap happy smile of the just saved plastered on his face
your little boy fell so hes screaming
and you want her to stay
lucy confused by his buoyant reaction nods
seven dollars an hour
see you later jeannie
he tries to kiss her but she shuns him
lucy now having an official status turns to admonish her
no thats okay
im fine with it
i feel fine
burke walks tight little circles near cathy and the rest of his staff while a few feet away studio executives stand in a cluster
there is a distant rhythmic shuffling sound
burke walks past cathy
nothing good that happens tonight can make it worth feeling the way i do right now
turning to cathy what do you think
nervously taking the plunge to be honest i had problems with ground zero
but this people get hurt one while it might not be my exact exact thing i think will really work for an audience
its so over the top you have a great time
so you think itll score big
where we discover the source of the sound
some twenty card counters on the floor riffling through stacks of cards with erasers
matt and nan stand in the doorway
my daughter used to throw fits in supermarkets when we first moved here
its all so perfectly normal
plus i know a great psychiatric childrens group
thats what breaks your heart
jeannies problem is that shes so down on herself
well shes lucky to have a daddy who cares believe me
i dont know if luckys the word
im hoping shes asleep when i get home so i wont have to deal with her
im actually afraid of my own kid
ive had exactly that feeling and never said it out loud
see there are men who talk my language and im just cursed that im not attracted to them because they are so nice they remind me of myself
in the b
the counting is completed
just a second
the group captain notes the figure on a sheet walks to the doorway and hands it to nan who is still deep into conversation with matt
she begins walking back to the theater without looking at the sheet in her hand
i felt terrible about the way i blew up at you when i first met you
before he can object please
burke and others waiting as matt and nan come to a stop some distance away
what are they doing
i began taking anti depressants when we moved here from washington
i had some small reactions sleeping hours no libido i gained pounds in nine days that sort of thing
so they gave me pills to deal with the side effects
and then pills to deal with the side effects i was getting from those pills
all this besides the stuff the nutritionist was giving me
the combination formed some sort of potion so that i keep telling the truth
i dont have a choice
thats why i was so rude to you
your doctor says this
hes excited but only because he sees glory for himself in it
see ordinarily i wouldnt say that about my doctor but i cant help it its the truth
hes monitoring me for a while longer before writing it up for this medical journal
cathy has joined them
burkes going crazy waiting for the score
to matt how are you anyway
matt shifts figuring out his answer
a small laugh its a tough one huh
nan looks down at the score
matt id better drive him myself
she starts for burke
as nan arrives and hands the studio executives the score burke looking over their shoulders
i can fix this
get some narration written
turning to director youll cut minutes
it will come out like butter
were only minutes now
mumbling to himself a minute movie
no that wont work
i have to go
i have a nanny problem
thanks for the support
she kisses his cheek and leaves
a beat of silence
burke turns to nan
again can you help
exactly the moment nan has been waiting for
she does have a valuable observation to offer at this dark moment
yes i can
hopeful go ahead
its only a movie
as burke looks at her from the depths of his pain and sees her confidently believing that she has imparted something of value the movies marquee lights go off giving
us a as he carries an enormously resistant jeannie wearing a borrowed t shirt nightie back towards his apartment
matt has jeannie under one arm her clothes and shoes in another
jeannies arms are extended towards lucy who stands in the open doorway of her apartment
she begins thrashing
giant tears come the moment is operatic
please lucy dont make me go
you can come back tomorr
listen to me jeannie
i want to live here with these people
god let me live here
maybe if she stayed tonight she
i love it here so much that
now her fathers last words have registered on her she immediately stops crying though tears still roll down her cheeks
daddy says i can stay
jeannie wriggles away towards lucys doorway
lucy takes several steps toward matt who obviously fears the looming exchange
i no think you can give her what pleases when she act like this
because then she think
matt is very much like a fighter taking a great deal of punishment knowing he is beaten but being told by his corner he must make a fight of it
he nods his head repeatedly in agreement
now he sniffs the air in quick rhythm hoping to draw in some courage and resolve
he moves to jeannie
youll see lucy in the morning
were going home
as they enter and matt pushes her into the other room and closes the door placing her in there alone
jeannie behind the double glass paneled doors of the bedroom
matt upset in a way he has never imagined as he pops a beer puts on some headphones for calming music and begins to read a book on child behavior
feeling the restrictions of her punishment pacing and now she begins to wail this lonely life
few adult women have sung with such appropriate passion out of need and loss aloneness and confusion
the song finishes
jeannie sits huddled
this rooftop serves as an outdoor commissary for popcorn pictures
there are a few tables snack machines and umbrellas
the whole d staff is there including cathy having lunch along with claire the casting assistant
in the b
we see matt huddled sitting on the roofs awful green outdoor carpeting feeling much the same as jeannie in the previous scene
off in the distance the popcorn execs contentedly ply their trade
as he overhears their conversation and the words begin to register in all their horror
will somebody take a minute to look over my casting list before burke gets here
scanning list this isnt so great millie
well i wanted to put in people we had a shot at getting
reading from list f
murray abraham jeff daniels ed harris john lithgow rip torn willem dafoe john malkovich
for an action lead
could you at least take it one person at a time instead of
lets play state the obvious
murray abraham has a nose as long as an aspen ski line ed harris is losing his hair joe mantegna has never played the lead in a big movie
willem dafoes teeth
bob hoskins looks fur bearing when he takes off his shirt
matt can take it no more
he hears a loud voice coming from his own throat
he wigs out
i cant stand it anymore
what in gods name are you doing in this job you have
as they all start to answer at once
i mean him
what in gods name do you know about casting
matt rises and walks towards the male d person
what do you know
you dont even know you have a habit of touching your tongue with a finger like you want to lick yourself
note this is his little habit yet you talk like you actually know something
so i want you to tell me
louder what you know
im not going to be drawn into this
ive been an actor most of my life and this is the first time ive ever heard what the people calling the shots sound like when theyre casting
so i really want to find out what if anything you know because what if nothing you know
i dont think the yelling is necessary
oh you couldnt be more wrong
and im not talking to you
and i dont like you
how about you just mind your own business
matt is very close to him he shakes his chair
youre minding my business
thats the problem
so just tell me what do you know
matts manner is threatening
the male d person looks around for some support and finds little
then matts tone changes
its reasonable almost seductive
just tell me and ill shut up
taking the bait first of all ive been going to movies since i was six for gods sake
what you know is the size of a schnozz
what you dont know is that these guys
indicates list are for real
she is a ricochet victim of every word matt says as he continues to indict the male d person and unknowingly reach her instead
his fury grows and becomes more complicated containing an element of mourning
again that they can make something happen and even they dont know what that is till they get in there and play a little
they can make something happen that you cant even imagine
and its not your fault this stupidity
cause youre just this scared little prick who gets to say hes making movies and the only thing they ever taught you is that what you like doesnt matter
frightened thanks for understanding
the anger leaves matt
he is depleted
but isnt it almost good manners for you to feel a little shame
cathy rises and begins to exit
again i didnt mean you
if you didnt you sure should have
the d persons colleagues have taken advantage of the beat to egg him on
you talk about manners are you actually so bitter you dont realize how you acted just now
youre gone pal
but at least know that we cant help that were making it
you got lucky with bitter
that word just scares me to death
a distraught cathy is walking down as burke bounds up
you look down
i appreciate the support
im not down for you
im down about myself
not hearing oh
what if ground zero doesnt do well this weekend
please listen to me
he nods but she pauses disconcerted
i just got this feeling of seeing myself talking to you and how this is the most important moment of
what is it
ive been watching this company make movies that cost tens of millions of dollars and all the while ive known about this wonderful script which we can somehow own and
we could make for about
if you can live without stars or a name director
is that it
okay send me
ive sent you coverage on it nine times
i swear to you burke it will work
youve never heard me say that
how about last night
an unexpectedly fierce outburst i dont know anything about action adventure
on his look she gains control i have no idea where that came from
hey i know everyone thinks i dont have any commercial sense because of what i said at the gremlins preview and all
and you think i cant put myself on the line
well if this picture doesnt work fire me
have me killed if it doesnt get good reviews
if this doesnt get a percent definite recommend from women and under i promise to be your sex slave until they drop ticket prices back to five bucks and start
enforcing the r rating
youre selling very excellent
very excellent presentation
youve got to do this
i think this movie can save me
disgusted oh please
whats the script
deeds goes to town
as matt exits his car with beaten down body language
as he leads jeannie briskly down the hall from lucys apartment and into his own
why couldnt you even look at the way i dressed ricky
look i dont want to talk about it
i just had a real rough day
so just let it sit there okay
but what was it
through gritted neck cords now i really need to be quiet
eyes him then you
i know what will cheer you up
moving very quickly and with great purpose she slaps a tape into a pink childs cassette player and music begins
jeannie sings along with the childs chorus on the tape you could be wonderful making with little hand motions the last thing matt needs but in due course he starts
to actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling
but before the mood can fully sweeten jeannie forgets the lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the tape continues to play
i cant even remember the words
i am stupid
no youre not
youre not stupid and im not bitter
and you know why
because theres no cure for either one and weve got to believe in some cure for each of us
i am stupid
i cant even remember the words to some baby song
i just cant do this now
the phone rings
as he goes to answer it
into phone hello
just a second
his mood has changed
its a fine sign that cathy has called him at home
he needs only for his child to take pity and listen to him
be quiet for one second
this is very important for me
she decides with some difficulty to let him continue
into phone so
good for you
jeannie mouths the words who is it
matt holds up a finger asking her to wait
this is great
ill come right over and pick up the script
if you want to
bring it over
to jeannie we might make it yet kid
as cathy drives past some rough examples of street life and finally finds matts building with its grim iron gate security system
cathy uncomfortable in these surroundings parks her car brushes her hair while at the same time putting in place a phony cheap car radio sticker over her own expensive system
and gets out
she buzzes his apartment and waits
ill buzz you in
youve got to be quick and push hard
in the b
we hear jeannie loudly imploring her father to make the person wait till shes finished dressing
there is the sound of the buzzer
cathy hurls herself at the door a good four times before finally timing it right and gathering the necessary strength to spill through
cathy stands there overhearing the voices from inside
but why cant i stay just a little while
because this is a very special friend of daddys and i need privacy
i let you wear that dress
matt opens the door
he steps aside so cathy may enter
the place is tidied up
he has changed his clothes and jeannie is wearing a lace dress fit for a young princess complete with flowered tiara and ballet slippers with trailing blue ribbons at the
heels and a velvet cape
this is my daughter queen elizabeth
jeannie this is cathy
what a pretty dress
happy that jeannie is behaving so well
are you going to a party
wildly hopeful am i going to a party dad
youre going next door
jeannie is crest fallen for a horrible second it looks as if she may start to wail
matt moves into action with a pep talk
remember our compromise
youre going next door to lucys to play and youll show the kids your dress and ill come get you later and well go out someplace and ill buy you
anything you want for under seventeen dollars
she starts for the door doubles back and kisses a surprised cathy full on the lips
the gesture is beautifully even movingly carried off
it is totally false
again to cathy goodbye
i love you
totally thrown well
jeannie is on the run
as she passes her father
jeannie nods acknowledgment as she flies past
favoring cathy matt leans out the doorway until jeannie is safely next door then re enters
what a little winner huh
waving script this is my favorite project
and it looks like were going ahead with it
deeds goes to town
oh its a remake
well come on whats original
and this is a wonderful rewrite
and theres a part in it for
burke says i can test whoever i want
he wasnt even surprised when i mentioned you
so if you could read this rewrite now and if you like it we can make a test deal
catching herself they can make a test deal
we can tell them that they can make a test deal
in explanation i think its important for me to steer clear of the business end
who goes to town yes
matt takes this in
takes this miracle in
who are we kidding
im even having trouble getting short parts im going to say i love it no matter what youve done to it
stop being so creepy honest
i really have an instinct about you for this
im going home call me when you finish reading it
how quickly status changes things or
come on over
a post coital moment though only the man is visible burke who lies on the bed wearing a shirt and tie and nothing else
nan lies out of sight on the floor where she is recovering from the deepest orgasm of her life
if you can test movies and premises and want to sees why cant you test screen tests
nan hauls herself into view climbing back onto the bed
i cant deal with your self centered dribble right now
i have just had the biggest orgasm of my life and im trying to figure out if im in love with you
tell me what made you rush over and pick me up and bring me here at six oclock
i mean we seem to have
she closes her eyes in a characteristic and touching gesture as the scientist in her struggles to be precise
again this unspoken agreement not to talk about why were together when were together and i dont think its good to let that become a pattern for us
she focuses again on burke
prepared for at last some verbal intimacy
why did i rush to you
because i felt like i had to
be with someone and you were closest
on nans reaction whats wrong
youre not at all aware that youve just said something
her eyes close unattractive
look im sorry if that came out
im not looking for an apology
im just trying to say that one of the things im not great at is
lets not make this about your shortcomings
im sure youve had enough of those conversations to last you a lifetime
no i havent
no you havent what
had a conversation about shortcomings
aghast no woman has ever told you that you have an almost barbaric insensitivity
that you seem to have lapsed into some final cynicism where you actually believe that not only does everyone think the way you do but only you have the courage
to express it
that you seem horribly certain everyone else is sort of pretending when they talk about love or seem to care for anything outside their own anus
no ones ever said that sort of thing to you
but i didnt get what you meant by shortcomings
hey if you think things like that what are you doing here
indignantly im here for the same reason percent of older women loved beauty and the beast
i would like to believe that underneath the creature there is a sweet caring guy
i sure hope youre wrong
nan breaks up shaking her head ruefully
i have to pick up leslie
burke not having intended humor is also lighthearted having somehow avoided a tight spot
matt holding the script walks the small lane through the tidy lawn to the perfect silver lake cottage
we hear music from inside
there is a note on the door which is slightly ajar reading come right in if you loved it ring if you have reservations
white walls thick rugs great great fantasy garret sparse but cozy
he walks a step then there is a girlish squeal and a naked cathy streaks the rest of the way to her bedroom from the bathroom
calling i mistimed it
sticking her head out the door i wanted you to catch me fully frontal
she smiles broadly hurriedly putting on something quick and loose to match her buzz
as she walks to him the phone rings
she ignores it
so you loved it
give me a second all of a sudden theres a lot to deal with
she sits on the sofa looking at him
again its terrific
pointedly do you see why i think youre right
because youre nice and you know i need work
lower you know this is really happening so i wish you wouldnt kid around about it
sorry but i think the audition rule is that i have to be serious unless the person in charge is wearing a bathrobe and her nipples are sticking out
holds fingers apart this much
cathy peeks down her bathrobe
there are some mixed signals coming out of here arent there
phone rings she answers hi
i cant write down a number now
call me back
to matt the script
its really good
i get a little nervous thinking about the opportunity
i want to hear everything
you want to go page by page
if its okay
i kind of work on these things in a private
its a little better for me if i dont
okay lets do it
it wont kill me
an uncertain beat and then she leans over and kisses him
a sound escapes him
they get up and begin walking to the bedroom
i swear to god i dont know which thing i want more the sex or the conversation afterwards
a smile what do you mean
as they enter and move to the bed where matt starts undressing
i mean i havent been to bed with anyone since jeannie got here
i havent talked to anyone the way i need to
cradling her breast i havent seen anything this beautiful
i havent felt this good about life
i mean ive been lonely cathy
as he enters her ill tell you the truth matt
ive never felt more like turning my phone off
she twists her body gracefully sexily towards the phone
you cant shut the phone off
i left this number with jeannies sitter
i dont understand what youre worried about
im not worried
but if the phone was off i would worry
but i get a lot of calls
i could put the machine on monitor but its going to be
i dont know
it will be okay
i think the most important thing is to stop talking about the phone
turn it off monitor whatever
she twists toward the phone again not quite so beautifully
as she hits the monitor button then turns back to him
you look so serious
i am so serious
matt totally there
this is major for him then he does something sensitive
reads her concern over the depth of his need and interest and shrugs indicating he cant help it
she likes him
as they make love
their union thrown off kilter by the phone messages which roll in periodically as they thrust and sweat towards intimacy
broadly hi cathy
all my magazines came today
read the new vanity fair they take apart three people we hate
spy is bad this month
scorsese didnt get the time cover the plane crash did
ha ha ha
why arent you at the office
you know im getting to the point where i prefer to reach peoples machines
the love making continues as the calls continue
are you there
are you there
im going to count to ten
one two three
then to someone passing his office did you go to the screening last night
what did you think
that makes two bombs in a row for her
into phone four five six
pick up if youre there
ive got major gossip
it could be good for us
cathy in the throes of sexual union feeling a bit divided by the offer on the phone
she shakes it off
is this the kind of crap you listen to all day
please were making love here
incredibly depressed if the tv show bombs theres going to be a dance party on my grave
i dont give a crap
nothing seems to have a point anymore
im really questioning everything
including action adventure
dont tell anyone im down
even destroy the message tape
dont tell anyone i said to destroy the message tape
dont even give hints that theres something you cant tell them but you wish you could
im losing it
im losing it
im losing it
dont tell nobody
dont tell nobody
dont tell nobody
the sound of a hang up
the couple having more difficulty making love
as they look to the phone and react still joined then sobbing daddy
berating someone who is with her you dialed bad
where is he
with jeannie coaching b
matt jeannie is very upset because you are not here when you said
and now the big hand is on the eight
the sound of a hangup
as matt springs from the bed
its all right
as he leaves is there a name for what we just had
burke in back as his anxieties gnaw away
this is awkward my driving you around and testing for you tomorrow
well i hope you understand i cant drive you to work tomorrow and then go in and test
burke reluctantly considers then okay
i was going to come in late anyway
ill get one of the kids to drive me
and look if i get the lead in this movie youll have to go back to sitting up front with me
burke laughs surprised at being genuinely amused
matt wildly dialing a phone orange juice in hand jeannie standing nearby
he shrieks one phrase
into phone no sitter
were leaving now
matt is in the final process of being made up going over his lines
theres a whole bunch of kids in the building
and theyre all ready for you
how many men are they testing today
youre the only one
matt is surprised
but he is a pro and so immediately makes use of this sudden blip in status
then tell them i need a little more time
no its okay were done
i mean for me
i want to focus a little
she hugs matt good luck matt
whispered advice the thing theyre looking for most is sexy
and then theyre gone
with that bit of advice matt is totally fucked up
a beat after cathy leaves you know who she was involved with for a minute or so
on their look
again you guys have to leave
this is important and i need to be alone right now
matt thumbs through the script
does a relaxation exercise
takes a breath and thinks
a beat and he is reasonably confident
he walks one half circle of the room making sure hes fully pumped then exits
as crowded as it was for the previous audition scene but this time they are reading children of varied ages and the kids and their parents are all over the
jeannie is filled with wonder and is arrestingly and atypically shy as she makes her way through this world of the young clinging to cathys hand as the kids sing
their version of make believe the stage parents taking one verse
at one point cathys begins talking to someone blocking jeannies view
get out of my way
dont say it like that
which way should i
polite little girl get out of my way
almost weeping get out of my way
furious get out of my way
all this noticed by a casting person with a clipboard
matt making his way past the last of the kid stragglers
cathy and jeannie come running up to him
it felt great
let me tell him let me tell him let me tell him
highly annoyed let him finish
i want to tell him
if you wait one minute ill let you
jeannie turns down her volume but keeps repeating incanting actually
i cant wait to tell him
i cant wait to tell him
i cant wait to tell him
anyway the girl i did it with by the way shes really good the director the crew
they all thought we nailed it
loving sexy hey
to cathy now
cathy nods and jeannie begins to push matt into cathys office for privacy
wait till you hear this one
jeannie sits her father down
this is the first time weve seen her joyful
some lady asked me to go in a room and you know make believe and say stuff like we were playing a game
the words coming so fast that jeannie lets loose with a bolt of song as if taking a moment to catch her breath
just a few sung lines proclaiming happiness
again and everybody went yea and they said they wanted me to be on television
and the sung phrase
and give me money and have a teacher there and a person to braid my hair and color my face and give me clothes
the sung phrase again
you wait here jeannie
several people milling about
matt eyes cathy
we still hear jeannies muffled singing from the other side of the door
furious i have to talk to you
as matt and cathy come into frame
matt forcefully placing her with her back to the wall
she is not one to be pushed around
what in hell is wrong with you
you actually think
im trying to hang in here but everything in me cuts off when somebody acts this way
continuing right along that you can have my kid audition for a show without asking me
she went for water and by the time she got back they had offered her the part
blame burke he was there
matt takes this in
just a millimeter underneath his fury is professional curiosity
whats the part anyway
the white kid in a multi racial foster home with all these kids of varying ages
its not a bad show
i sure cant wait to see the test
how were they able to test her so fast
they offered it to her off the reading
i meant your test
a child actor
just what any kid with problems needs to straighten out a series of her own
cathy has nothing to offer
matt begins leading her back
we hold on their backs and see the chink in matts confidence hear the tightness in his voice as he asks youll let me know as soon as they see
youve got my vote
they hold hands
jeannie a script in her lap caressing it avoiding her fathers gaze
he sits nearby sizing her up pissed
im doing it
not if i dont let you
thats the law the police law
she takes this shot hard but tries to pretend otherwise continuing to stare hard at her script to avoid him
do i have to learn to read to be on television
with a real edge youre going to have to learn to look at me and listen to me and the longer i have to wait the angrier looks up suddenly
im so mad
because i know about this
i have worked with kid actors
they dont have that much fun
theyre inside all day
they dont get to go to regular schools or play with their regular friends like ricky and essa
progressively losing it and their parents
you think im going to be one of those parents sitting in one of those rooms where we all go crazy trying to jump start our egos with our kids
sweat all the time smiling at each other like our lives are working while we root against everyone elses little girl
jeannie is totally confused until no
so no youre cuckoo anyway
i wont do it
and i dont care because im be stupid at it anyway
she throws the script down
tears in her eyes
pick it up jeannie
shes so down she complies picking it up and walking it to the trash can
matt stops her and takes the script
lets work on it
the staff of popcorn pictures is gathered in the boss office watching matts screentest on projection tv
burke sits next to nan on a sofa cathy sits in front of him others in chairs or on the floor
one assistant is attempting to fine tune the color the tint bar graph is on screen sliding between and as the color changes
burke talks sotto to nan
so how do you think ground zero will do tonight
she ignores him continuing to watch the screen
he leans into her
how do you think my movie will do tonight
testy im not going to talk to you during matts screentest
cathy turns in her chair and mouths thank you to nan
to himself how bad can it be
weve got to have at least a two million dollar friday
theres nothing else out there
turning to him please
a very attractive actress is crying
matt very close to her
stop playing with that thing
the color bar graph does a quick slide and disappears from the screen leaving the actors faces green
crying cmon deeds tell me about the meeting
dont worry about my crying
as a matter of fact crying turns me on
well in that case your dog died
there is laughter in the room
the actress smiles through her tears pats matt for being wonderful
what happened at the meeting
i cant remember
youre too pretty
on her look oh i told them id keep on being chairman
then explaining im chairman you know
smiling i know
told them id keep on being chairman if they hired everybody back
what did they say
oh that i was crazy
you always wear your hair back like that
she kisses him
we hear the director say cut
the girl and matt hug no longer in character as others come in to congratulate them
ad libbed enthusiasm
mostly about the girl
as the conversation about the girl grows more pointed
cathy impassive outwardly recoiling inwardly
okay come on
lets have our creative meeting right here
well id sure go to bed with her
professionally concurring very fuckable
id sure fuck her
what about him
i think hes a very good to excellent actor i do
puzzled but theres something
you wouldnt want to fuck him
well six years ago maybe
i think hes talented and attractive
so youd want to fuck him
he might be light in that area
the man is talented
if you get one of those directors who like actors i think
a director cant make you hot if youre not hot
youll end up with warm which is death
defending matt slightly we laughed
let me ask you something
would you fuck him
wearily everything doesnt boil down to
let me stop you before you embarrass yourself
burke rises and addresses his staff
the camera has his back in the foreground as it moves towards a rendezvous burke moving too as he continues
again we all can do our little lectures on what things boil down to
everybody else here was professional enough to come out and say
id fuck her
i wouldnt fuck him
and youre ducking it
i want you to forget the acting stuff and totally focus on the issue
and now burke and camera meet up the effect being that he is talking directly to us as he continues
again we do have some kind of responsibility to the audience
you just saw his screentest
so if this is the first time you saw the guy do you come out thinking to yourself and your girl friends id sure go to bed with him oh
god would he be something
would you cathy
im being real here
okay so lets keep looking
they file out
cathy gets up several beats later than the others
and follows them out avoiding nans look
shes been sitting here for quite a while
she can postpone no longer she dials as one of her movie sound tracks plays in the background
into phone hello
she listens waiting for him to quiet jeannie
maybe it would be easier if i just said hi to her
yes its exciting
hes right honey they get somebody to read it to you
now put your dad on its important
no first put your dad on
she waits a beat matt
uh huh a few hours ago
everyone liked your work but i think theyll go for a name or something
she listens to him
he is hurt
cathy though is also wrestling with her own internal struggles
she has betrayed him and is ashamed in a strange way terrified
she is therefore just a little irritable
again its not a matter of doing it differently
they liked what you did a lot
they laughed and
its not you
suddenly her breath comes weird no please
dont thank me
if you feel like getting together later or anytime call me okay
you sound like you have your hands full right now
as he hangs up
i wanted to talk to her again
she stops in mid sentence looking at her father
he is overcome
his energy failing to get him past this most awful moment in his life
she moves to his side
he starts to cry and urgently seeking privacy he moves quickly towards the bathroom rubbing jeannie in an instinctive gesture of reassurance
he closes the door
devoid of anger
sympathy so pure that it wrenches
she starts to move towards the bathroom
her voice sweet
matt opens the door quickly
im sorry i forgot to put you back on with cathy
he walks across the room jeannie tracking him
you didnt cried because of that
i dont even want to talk to her
matt sits down still suffering a bit of dysfunction unable to keep up appearances other than a few minor half hearted tweaks at his daughter who stands solemn and silent
at his side
she pets him some
this goes on for several beats as the strains of you could be wonderful accompany the moment
then a whisper dad
can i say just one thing
with some effort matt lifts his head and nods permission
youve got to make me supper
matt nods rises and leads her into the small kitchen
burke is wearing a t shirt and shorts as he walks to his four stops past state of the art stairmaster and turns it on while looking over his shoulder
at the telephone
now sucking in some courage he goes to the phone and speed dials
he begins to climb the stairs
you have reached the warners hotline
estimated box office grosses for friday december rd weekend number are as follows in millions of dollars
he braces himself
there is a tone then due to the high volume of calls we must ask you to wait till a line is clear
at first from the speaker phone
burke moving in time to there is a lonely
and now singing
as the lyric concludes and the instrumental comes in
again thanks for waiting
weekend grosses follow in millions of dollars
two point one eight million down percent
burke smiles with pleasure
his steps becoming lighter more fanciful
again best girl theaters six point four million up percent
contemptuously cappuccino movies
opening this weekend double dare two theaters fourteen point three million
and now his film ground zero is coming up to bat
as succor to the gods he tries to make his dance gleeful in anticipation
again ground zero theaters no million point four thousand dollars
burke falls off his stairmaster and from his new position finishes his song
matt is driving
burke is seated alongside him talking without looking at him
im going to pieces
whispering the picture was budgeted at million and i spent so they were a little mad at me to begin with
now it doesnt open even with an arbys roast beef tie in
i mean we only averaged dollars a theater
theyre going to think im woody allen
i dont think you have to worry about that
but this is private
what about the exit survey
did we do good with any group at all
now we hear nans voice on the speakerphone which burke has been addressing all along
i cant hear you but hi matt that was funny
i dont think you have to worry about that
she laughs delightedly
burke leans across matts lap to get closer to the microphone
did we do well with any group at all
eleven year old boys in the south
he sits stupified
matt is he
ill see you later
he hits the end button
he slumps for a second then im all alone
pause at least theres that
as the car arrives outside popcorn pictures we can see some child actors and their parents arriving at the sound stage next door
are you going to need me
the kids are rehearsing and id like to take a look
i have to stay inside during lunch hours now anyway thats when everybody returns my calls because theyre trying to miss me
amazed is that true
thanks for the support
a row of parents standing near their child actors adjusting them not unlike handlers of racing greyhounds
seen from a distance her father behind her
in the foreground the mass of workers on the stage it is in effect her pov even though she is in the extreme background of the shot
we move closer to jeannie and her father even a bit behind them
jeannie is scared
i bet i know what it looks like to you
a giant find waldo
despite herself she smiles at the reference though her tone is a bit sarcastic
five minutes children then we need you for work on the set
that pretend living room right over there
holding her arm wait a second jeannie
let daddy give you a few tips here
twisting away nooo
ive got to get to work
she breaks free depriving matt of the sweet and simple moment he wanted with her
shes one of the first ones on the set other kids still hugging their parents
as cathy comes up behind matt we can hear jeannie who having so small a trust for her father needs to confirm what he just told her
faintly is this the set
parents to room two please
as he goes by matt parents to room two please
jeannie is watching
again we have to clear the set
matt looks him off fiercely
the passing voice addresses the friendlier parents
again this way parents
im glad i found you
as they walk
you holding up
what did you do last night after i called
as if teasing what do you think i did
i cried like a baby
so you dont want to tell me
be a tough guy
now you got it
i feel relieved just seeing you after all that stuff
preparing to go burke wants to
you ever go out with him
cathy is as simple and direct as she is embarrassed
you slept with him
did you hate it
reeling a bit good lord
this is the thing that makes me nervous about you
you keep on assuming im nicer than i am
he kisses her
she kisses back
then there is an extraordinarily loud and piercing voice
he turns to see jeannie beckoning to him from the stage the director standing at her side joins in
he walks to them
the director is talking to jeannie who seems even from a distance distraught and lost
she sees matt
theres such trouble
shes very worried about being able to pretend cry when she has to and she doesnt get it about memorizing
aghast thats all
the director beckons matt to lead her away
this isnt going to be good
not with that attitude
she seems stung by this unusually vulnerable
he changes tactics softening
again its just that they
well did they tell you what an audience is
insulted i know what an audience is
now because theres an audience they want you to know all the words you have to say really well
and since you cant read yet
off her fierce look youre going to have to be patient and try hard
i can help you
she grasps at this unlikely straw
can you help me to cry
on her broad disbelief i can
i can help make it okay
jeannie pauses half a beat then i miss my mother bigger than you know
matt on phone jeannie standing next to him reaching for the phone
to jeannie not yet
into phone thank you
we really appreciate this
jeannie grabs the phone in a flash
softly into phone mom
would you talk
id just like to listen to you
let me sit down
jeannie sits herself by the window protected by an iron grill and sits listening to her mother
there is about this pose something prescient unmistakably jeannie will look this way again as a young woman cloaked in the love of some guy
but for now its her mother her crazy mother who blots out dread
matt is struck by how quiet and adoring jeannie looks even as he moves to give his daughter some privacy
several beats jeannie noticing her dad looking at her switching positions body language indicating that she wants to put him out of her mind
then a thought
dad says hes going to make me to really cry
jeannie your moms not going to understand what you mean
jeannie shushes him resisting with surprising will and strength when he tries to get the phone
to matt she understands
into phone hes being terrible right now
faster avoiding matt i love loved the coloring book you sent me
i love you
let me hang up first
send me a letter
and a beaded t shirt
she hangs up
why dont you let me be on your side for a second
i cant even understand what youre saying now
do you know what trust means
it means that even if something is hard to believe you believe someone you trust because you know he wouldnt say it unless it were true
so i dont trust anybody right
yeah i think you get the concept
you dont make sense
i dont understand you
i think you do
jeannie reacts broadly
indicating what a difficult man shes stuck with
just know that
giving up you want to help me make a phone call
she goes quickly to the phone and picks it up
hitting numbers who are we calling
shes very nice
hard to read very nice
as she answers phone
to matt what now
tell her how are you and then let me
how are you
i cant talk now because
wait my dad wants to
tell him i cant talk cause im on the phone with a director
he wants to talk to you very much and
sharply i cant
i have to hang up
jeannie truly stung by the hang up
she takes this act of cathys as an insult to herself and her father
matt doesnt feel too wonderful about it himself
you have to understand that sometimes people are too busy
so shes too busy for you
burke and nan eating together on an elevated balcony overlooking the main eating area
we look like jerks eating here this early
everybodys going to think we couldnt get a reservation for the hot hours
why do you do this to yourself
why do you insist on eating dinner in a restaurant where youre bound to see all the people youre afraid of
im not afraid of them
what do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself
how did little jeannie do today
isnt it something that they have you testing the tv show
what i asked was how did jeannie do
what are you talking about
how did she do
dont talk to me like this
really pissed i want to be treated as if im really saying words to you which you engage and respond to
i like matt id like to know how his daughter did
so before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and i end up feeling so sorry for you that i could die i would like you to answer
she did okay
and dont worry about matt
if the pilot sells his kid will be making five thousand a week
so what do you know about people get hurt
im told that theyre not going to release it
what the hell are you smiling for
but telling you about this latest failure of yours it pleases me
i have no idea why
i cant be with someone whos not rooting for me
i think i am
its just that rooting for you is a good deal more complicated than you realize
as he rises dont go
im not that mad
i gotta do this
music in as burke leaves the table
this dance of desperation is classical
burke himself lifting one of the women in greeting then as he puts her down
i thought you were someone else
as he continues to go from table to table
as she looks down on him dying for him we hear her sing the song poor bastards
finally not only about burke but the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with
now nan can take no more
as he sees her go past in the background he goes after her finally grabbing her near the maitre d station
this just as two important couples arrive
burke frantically tries to cover
nan you know victor and his wife
he mumbles unable to remember any wifes name and jay and his wife
he mumbles yes
im sorry i cant talk now
im very upset about whats happening to burke so i just made up my mind i cant be witness to it anymore if i love him and i certainly shouldnt
be here if i dont
so i was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in
im sure youve had something like this happen to you some time
some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public
they all nod and ad lib agreements with her premise to burkes amazement
again thank you for understanding
to burke goodbye
i wish only good things for you even though i feel ive been really damaged by this relationship
she exits enormously upset
burke torn between following her and repairing the social damage
but the couples are paying him no mind rather they are impressed with nan
as they comment i
wasnt that spectacular
ive never seen anybody that secure
burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him
were very close
the strains of poor bastards underscoring the moment as burke rushes into the parking area and grabs nans hand just as a valet brings her car
you dont understand that im exhausted from hurting
im through with you
she begins to cry
ordinarily this would be a scene which would be unendurable for burke
however the lesson of a moment ago is not lost on him
as people get out of cars and witness the sobbing nan
to restaurant patrons excuse me were working our shit out
im sure it happened to you
you know private stuff in public
the reaction to his openness is disdain and passing contempt
she drives off leaving burke hurt and alone
poor bastards up and out
the lighting soft and sweet
jeannies words are tentative as she talks to her father who sits watching intently
i dont know if ive been bad
i know somebodys been bad
hopefully maybe its you
jeannie looks at him shyly
he looks at her with encouragement
suddenly she is in his arms hugging him hard an emotional dam seems to have broken
oh i love you so much i love you so much
i love you so much
matt holds on clearly deeply moved
then he exercises the effort to control his emotions and speaks surprisingly as a black woman
as black woman i hope that makes you feel a whole lot better chile
cause it sure goes a long way to cure what ails me
i cant believe i
as himself coaching got in this much
got in this much trouble
i cant believe i got in this much trouble over a word
now do you know what she means when she says that
i dont want to talk about it just say her stuff so i know mine
she starts to flail a bit
its your choice
but im not helping unless you try to understand as well as memorize
it will be fun
i know its hard
anything to shut me up huh
okay this little girl youre pretending to be
she cant be with her mommy either just like you or her father
she has to stay in rainbow house which is called that because
jeannie starts fidgeting jeannie
she stops because everyones a different color
so when this little girl calls the black lady who takes care of all the children this terrible word
its like the worst thing anybody can do
approaching him i dont want to do the i love you again
yeah i might have been working you too hard on that one
she is unable to resist muttering one sarcastic shot
why dont you do that with poopie cathy
ignoring her now did the director tell you how he wanted you to do it
he said to smile all the time almost and to talk
we dont always get good directors so its important for us
youre not in the show
im referring to the family of actors you little shithead
jeannie doesnt know quite how to take the name calling
were heading for a rendezvous with a dance as it continues across the cut to matt and jeannie walking from the catering truck
they are eating ravenously
this is so good
its a breakfast burrito
its what actors eat when theyre working
now lets work a little more
the most important acting you do is when you listen
youre worried about being able to cry when youre supposed to right
well there are really only two ways to do it
think of something that makes you really sad
or forget youre you and really forget youre pretending
how do i do that one
matt reads from script
as a furious black woman dont test me child
i could eat you for lunch when i was your age and im a hell of a lot bigger now
jeannie looks afraid
you just looked at me and acted right without even thinking
and there are games you can play to help you with this
she does now be my mirror
do exactly what i do
now at a certain point im going to become your mirror but im not going to tell you when
you tell me
were going to make up words
the words arent what matter now
im on a roof
youre a great dad
then stops then smiles at him this acting exercise of chicagos story theater leads into the song be my mirror
as the song finishes matt and jeannie are in the best spirits weve seen as an a
they need you
she takes the a
s hand as matt calls
dont mention it
cathy is in mid conversation with millie
matt enters and boldly says his piece
im a free man
lets go to your house and break the answering machine
you know i could get away now
but ive got a big meeting later
wed better take two cars
millie having been at the screen test viewing is taken aback looking from one to the other
cathy knows what shes thinking and is unnerved feeling silently accused as she leads matt out
see you later
cathys car followed by matt in burkes car
the frame holds both cars close as if this were one long car
she seems troubled
then a decision
she dials a number on her mobile phone and picks up the receiver
the phone rings
he punches the speaker button
i hope its you
delighted so this is how the big ones make out
almost bumper to bumper
she takes a breath and then plunges
as he hears one of the more ominous phrases of the motion picture community
matt will you take me off the speaker
he picks up the phone
we intercut between the cars
whats the matter
hyper i dont know whether im being a coward for telling you this way or brave for telling you period
can you hear me
but i better talk fast because this is where my phone always kicks out
when we did your screentest
can you hear me
well i sort of folded on you at the end
she pauses silence then matt
you didnt like what i did
but the discussion got sort of dumb
it was a question of sexiness
thats what it came down to
well sort of yes
you folded on whether or not im sexy
you dont think im sexy
and you expressed that to
well ill tell you
i certainly must think so pretty much because i feel great about where were going now
there is a longish line of cars behind matt and cathy
are you very mad at me
you were just
aw damn it i am
matt manages to pull to the side
the other cars gobbling the places behind cathy who sees this
and now she watches matts car recede from her view
cathy going out of sight
as he lets her go
he is in bed wearing a bathrobe watching projection tv
number seven at the box office this week end is
he switches channels
the two words are tom cruise
he switches channels
becoming the first lawyer to be awarded his own star on hollywood boule
he turns off the tv and crosses to the phone allowing us to read the back of his bathrobe rocky balboa
he looks at the clock which reads four a
i hope its not too late to call
she has been crying
id like another chance
you only think you feel that way because youre on the verge of failure and youre without a core
nobody else gets me
a beat then you wanna have a little sex honey
a beat then you know ive never hung up on anybody in my life
because what if the next thing they said solved everything
but i must end this conversation
nan hangs up
burke picks up a pocket electronic notepad from the bedstand and hits the scroll button
names and phone numbers
he scrolls past numbers considering finding them wanting so that finally he is scrolling the emptiness of his relationships
now he considers one number and dials
the phone rings
he picks it up
hi matt this is burke
im sorry to bother you at home but you know nan
we were going out a little and i could use another guys slant on whats just happened
i dont think i can get into this
did i catch you at a bad time
you caught me at a bad time you caused
oh you mean about the screentest
the whole room thought you did good work
reinventing irony thanks
yeah look im not going to bother you about my thing
okay good night
as he hangs up
looks down and turns off his phone number pocket computer
music recalls princes there is lonely
music segues to recall ill do anything as he drives past the line waiting to see rainbow house
we see jeannies face in the mirror but it is seen through something resembling fleece which we now recognize as the strands of jeannies hair being combed out to the
side by an expert hair dresser
jeannie is shifting nervously in the large room where each chair is filled with a child of a different age and color
in the b
we can hear the voice of the warm up man
pilot for a new show called rainbow house
just listen to our band and ill be back to tell you more and make you love me
the audience laughs thinly
the band plays as someone closes the door to the make up room muffling the offstage sound
there is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room
jeannie sits between a fourteen year old hispanic boy and a four year old asian girl
the room is abuzz
kids running lines and loudly talking
this builds to a musical life as in our first audition scene
there is a briefly sung phrase jeannie not taking part
the parents in the same variety of skin colors as the child actors are stuffed into a small room being patronized by the assistant director
matt is grimly seated in the middle of a long sofa containing stage mothers
another sofa is two feet away the parents strain at each other
is talking grandly but we cannot hear his words because the rainbow parents are singing a phrase from the same song we heard in the make up room
matt does not take part in the singing
the music goes under allowing us to now hear the a
and when youre in the audience make sure you laugh and applaud even when its somebody elses kid
there is appreciative laughter from everyone save matt who rises in disgust and crosses out of the room
again youre not allowed near the stage
we only have a few minutes
matt ignores him and exits
matt moving about the area looking for jeannie spots a cluster of other cast members excitedly awaiting their introduction
jeannie not among them
talks with concern to a p
let me know if you see the little white girl
matt growing concerned walks on then across the stage to the distant make up room
jeannie alone in the room which is so brightly lit it creates a bizarre effect as if she were under a surreal spotlight
music reprises jeannies sinead oconnor song lonely life of mine
stopping his impulse to go to her he continues to observe
jeannie is nervous and uncertain
she plays with the handle of the make up chair
turns herself back and forth
then a very attractive ten year old boy enters the scene obviously telling her to hustle
he offers his hand and she takes it instinctively masking all clues that this hand holding is a first of great moment in her life
as they move toward the main stage area jeannie looks around needing something
she turns sees her father and gives a small cursory nod
he moves quickly drawing even with her but still giving her a bit of space and a low key pep talk
youre not even here tonight
theres only this other little girl that youre pretending to be who lives at rainbow house
and who just vomited
matt breaks up
even jeannie smiles briefly then she takes him aside for privacy
i just found out that we bow before we even do anything
and everybody claps
i made up a great bow
you going to look
wouldnt miss it
im not going to be able to cry
its too hard for me
hey then theyll just give you more chances after everyone leaves
this does not satisfy her
she rolls her eyes as she is pulled away towards the front of the stage
matt watches as the year old veteran actor leads his little daughter towards her debut
music a tension filled version of poor bastard
burkes stride was never stronger his posture never worse head hunched down into his neck
suddenly he reacts as he sees the staff of popcorn pictures grouped together backstage
cathy walking towards the group hurriedly from one direction as burke approaches from the other
seeing his staff has clearly moved burke
look at you
youre all here because of whats on the line for me tonight
having this many people in your corner helps more than i would have ever guessed
im just very grateful that i made you come
he starts off but a jubilant cathy stops him whispers something
he reacts with excitement
she sees matt deep in the wings watching the stage
she calls to him with some urgency
he turns and she beckons him towards her
with some hesitance he joins her
i dont want to miss her introduction
ill talk fast
its amazing news
oliver stones been looking for a comedy and
distracted ive got to see my kid
her voice breaking hes doing my picture
he starts off
part of this involves you
he remembers you from platoon and wants to use you in this one
he stops got your attention huh
matt is terminally disappointed in her last cynical sentence
look im going to watch this
let me talk to you later or tomorrow
thanks for your help
its good news
from the stage we hear the voice of the warm up man
first in her first appearance ever jeannie hobbs
there is applause
matts missed her intro
why couldnt you wait till later
broadly i guess its because im just incredibly insensitive to all human needs
id ask you to save me but im so far gone i wouldnt want you to waste your time
after a moment huh
she reacts but he walks off not wanting to get into it
cathy however has had a tricky nerve struck
she continues biting off each word
you know i dont have a kid or a mate or a talent
holding up book bag i got this
shes quite upset and shoot me if i think its important
cathy who looks alone and adorable as we hear music of this lonely life of mine
he puts a comforting hand on her
she speaks nakedly from deep within herself her eyes downcast
you think im a superficial jerk
and then a whispered afterthought you cant be right
i think youre the best of the bunch
broadly oh great
and now she raises her eyes big blue and vulnerable
if this look were returned i love yous could flow they could sink to the floor in a joint epiphany but there is no romance or kindling in matts eyes
he is in a hurry
pridefully cathy turns and walks off in the opposite direction her flight so instinctive she forgets her book bag
we hold on this her exit then standing just behind the four television cameras immediately behind them the rail where the shows staff and crew members and network bosses stand
crowded choreographed in the way in which they clear for a moving camera
behind these people is the studio audience
there is a loud laugh
burke turns around to study the audience
happy faces accompanied by the strains of burkes love song to the crowd
to matt what do you think
but matt doesnt hear him
a few feet away jeannie is making ready for her big moment
three cameras swing in front of them tv monitors showing a master and close ups of the three characters in the scene a short comic white man the black female
lead and jeannie dressed as a poor child
wide eyed wait
this is it
its like everyone is pi
ticked off at me because im not colored
the white man jumps on the phrase
correcting her pompously the word is black
correcting him with booming voice the word is african american
a burst of laughter whooping and applause from the audience
burke brags in a whisper to matt
i had them bring in two busloads of people from black churches
as they play out the scene
scolding jeannie now you use it in a sentence
look at me i
and jeannie begins to falter
she must somehow cry at this moment
she looks outward for help
she looks at the lead actress giving jeannie all she can
jeannie still cant cry
she looks past the cameras
her father nervously pulling for her
that didnt do it either
she looks into herself
she blinks there are tears running down her cheek
matt very much as he was when he watched brando on the plane
and then some
burke craning to make sure the network bosses are suitably transported
use it in a sentence
crying fully look at me
i love an african american
look at me
i love a little redneck
the black lead actress holds out her arms to jeannie who tears streaming down her face runs towards the arms
his lips pursed tightly in pleasure then agape in shock
jeannie has run past the lead actress and off the set going into her fathers arms instead
she jumps on him her legs and arms wrapped around him
pridefully you little stinker
you big stinker
my little stinker
my big stinker
the background to this intimacy is enormously alive
the lead actress and the character actor laughing out loud
in the b
we see the audience filling out preview cards as the floor manager leans in to say its okay jeannie
take a minute
we just need to get that hug at the end
to floor manager amazing right
to jeannie you were great
you look happy
i loved it daddy
matt starts to walk her back to the set
you want me to put you down
her answer surprises him
this is okay
now youre not finished until you hug the lady just like you did me
he puts her down
she turns from him to go back to work but on impulse he restrains her
he is kneeling down holding her lightly by the arms her back to him as he states an ultimate truth im very proud of you
i love you more than anybody
jeannie shocked by her fathers unprecedented sentiment turns to face him and clamp a hand over his mouth so he will add no more lush and primal affection
having silenced him though she finds that she has something of her own to say
shed never tell it to her father but she cant resist telling it to her acting coach
when i had to cry i thought of you buried in the ground
a beat then give me a kiss
the cast of rainbow house taking off their make up changing clothes etc
this is more than high energy and excitement whats the opposite of trauma
all are off the wall with pleasure the musical life of the earlier dressing room scene returning peaks of glee resulting in sung phrases as before
jeannie enters and is immediately surrounded with love attention and ad libbed compliments about her work
in this glare of good will jeannie turns gloriously shy
do you have any idea how special you were
on jeannies goony reaction that looks like a yes
youve got to get dressed for the party
overwhelmed theres more
then what will i wear
go to wardrobe theyll give you anything you want
she moves to her dressing table sits looks in the mirror and giggles uncontrollably
matt stands waiting for jeannie
it didnt sell
this show didnt sell
how do you know so fast
its the first time they had me do cards for a pilot and the demographics are all wrong for after nine oclock
thats their only opening
jeannie exits the make up room aglow
she is wearing an incredibly stylish outfit and her hair is in an expertly done intricate braid
im a good friend of your dads
did you see it
to jeannie yes and you were wonderful
aside to matt percent likeability
to jeannie and knowing that you were that good means so much more than the show not going
to matt i couldnt help it
what does she mean
to nan what do you mean
to matt what does she mean
to nan what do you mean
that theyre not going to be doing any more of these shows right now but
struck oh my god
and that means theyre not going to have a party
theyre still having the party
totally relieved oh
can we stay late
to which matt answers honey were going to close the place
the door to the roof garden opens and jeannie enters her dad behind her as she sees the party
the sparkling lights the decorations the other kids and music
our opening song
as her father urges her into the flow
she passes millie who is dancing with the boy who held jeannies hand
i cast him so he has to dance with me but im sure hed prefer dancing with you
to jeannie come on
you know how
angrily with disdain yesssssss
they begin to dance with the others
music slows in tempo as we indicate time passage and perched on a ledge eyeing the party
im not comfortable with television anyway
its too small
im much better at something with size
i dont do itzy
even this movie of cathys its small
but with stone it takes on a certain volume where i start to feel comfortable
out of nowhere i hate my life
backtracking in a way
i had a drink in my office
youre not saying anything
is it because youre not listening or because i havent stopped talking
this oliver stone thing
does he really want me
i forgot to say congratu
which one you want
one of the two leads wouldnt be bad
its the crippled factory owner
best part in the movie
he gets off the ledge and starts to move away
burke moves quickly to cut him off
wait a second
i want to see my kid
a second look theyre taking the cast picture now anyway
jeannie working her way to the absolute middle of the cast picture where she plops on someones lap
she doesnt look anything like the women i usually go with
and you know what they say beauty fades
what they dont say is that it fades very slowly
you dont think i can tell you what to do
only i can do that
i want you to tell me what to feel
he begins to use his fingers to run down nans qualities look
i trust her
more important everyone does
you have no idea how impressed people are with her
you never know what shell say next
her work is amazing
i like talking to her
you have no idea what to expect next
i respect what she does more than any writer or director sincerely much more unusual much more important
he walks away
burke waves a grateful goodbye and looks around the room until he sees nan eating cake with her hands
she sees him
he indicates he would like to dance
she does not move a muscle in response
still he walks towards her
she begins to shake her head no
he shifts uncomfortably but keeps coming until he reaches her side
dance with me
she shakes her head on a business basis
he turns away dejected but ill dance with you because i think it will reassure me that i should have nothing to do with you
ill take it
as they dance
why are you breathing so heavy
look lets move our thing in a more regular direction
what do you mean
let me think
then what if we go out this weekend
before she can say no with your kid
several more beats of dancing as he awaits her answer
whose name is
whose name is
then triumphantly leslie
song back wow
sung as a chorus
a slower cadence for the romance as we
change music and they dance more closely
the song slows for time passage and music changes to be my mirror as we
matt and jeannie the last ones there
he holds her in his arms dancing
she is asleep
he dances her to a chair with her wrap on it
shifts her around wrestling to get it on
she wakes up and puts it on herself
looking around satisfied last ones here
well i told you
he takes her hand and starts to lead her towards the stair shed then i never got to see your bow
she looks up smiling pridefully to see her father smiling back pridefully
as if its a great sacrifice oh all right
it is a bow all her own
