written by robert riskin of a large impressive looking building on the corner of a busy new york business street
a dignified brass plate sign on the side of the building reading union lower portion of high bronze doors one side of which is partly opened
sitting in front of the closed side is a uniformed officer greeting ad lib the various employees as they enter
of a cover being yanked off an adding machine
a telephone operator busily plugging in wires
mechanically sweet voice good morning
union national bank just a minute of the inside of a massive vault door made impressive by the shining finely cut steel bolts and the many other intricate looking instruments
which adorn it
camera pans up to a clock overhead which registers
a group of young men paying tellers are impatiently watching a teller struggle with the lock that will admit them to the vault
come on come on oscar what are we waiting for
whats the matter
cant you find it
sneak up on it boy
oscar come on
say if it had lipstick on it hed find it
they all laugh as oscar finds the combination
almonds to you
now now oscar not almonds
the camera moves with them as they pass through the first portal
nine oclock and all is lousy
yes i spend half of my life waiting for these time clocks to open
say wheres matt
probably upstairs thinking up that daily joke
that guy kills me with his wisecracks
say when he comes in lets put on a frozen face
lets not smile
they ad lib agreement
here he comes camera picks up matt brown the chief teller as he strides briskly in and begins turning the combination dial to the main vault
he is about twenty six a clean looking personable youngster
several of the tellers are standing close to him looking on
how are you doing slaves
howre you matt
matt begins to work the combination of the main lock
with his back to them say did you boys ever hear the story of the pawnbroker with the glass eye
no matt what is the story about the pawnbroker with the glass eye
as he continues to fiddle with the lock well ill tell you
a fellow went into this shop to pawn his watch
the pawnbroker said ill give you for it if you can tell me which is my glass eye
the fellow said all right ill do that
its the right one
the pawnbroker said thats correct
but how did you know it was the right one
said well its got more sympathy than the other one
he turns expecting their laugh but is confronted by stone faces
you know the right one had more sympathy than the other one
whats the matter
cant you get this thing open
matt stares in disbelief then gets the joke
contemptuously six reasons why banks fail
this cracks them all up as a uniformed officer who has been standing by works a lever attached to the floor which lowers a section of the floor directly in
front of the vault
this permits the vault door which is sunk below the floor level to swing open
ad libbing i love your jokes matt
theyre so entertaining
a very funny man
matt opens the inside door made up of perpendicular steel bars
the tellers scurry into the cavernous looking interior
someone snaps on a light
camera trucks the back walls of the vault are lined with steel cabinets divided into many small compartments
on one side is a wall safe which is also opened by a combination and which contains the surplus cash carried by the bank
matt is in charge of this
all around the room are numerous hand trucks one for every teller
these trucks contain the cash in the charge of the individual tellers
while the tellers in the b
obtain their keys and open the drawers of their trucks matt examines the time clock which is attached to the inside of the vault door
at the door as matt enters and goes directly to the burglar alarm box to the left of the doorway
he leans over to throw off the burglar alarm switch
the handle of the switch points in the direction of a sign reading on
matts hand comes into the scene and throws the switch up toward a sign reading off
this is done with no comment it being a routine matter with matt
come on white collars
the days started
as the tellers file out with their trucks
before they do however each one signs the cashbook
one or two exit silently
as one of the tellers comes into scene
matt examines the cashbook
youre carrying too much money on you hank
you better turn some in tonight
as he goes okay matt
he exits out of scene
how are you fixed
im okay matt
to another teller youve got enough
ill be all right
charlie the last man comes up
say matt ill have to have some money for those manville payrolls
about twenty four thousand
counting out money it was more than that last week
heres twenty five thousand
he hands charlie four stacks of bills
as charlie is signing the cash book matt speaks say do me a favor will you charlie
let me have ten bucks
aghast ten bucks
say if i had ten bucks id quit
charlie starts out
matt follows him
as charlie comes out followed by matt
camera trucks along with them as they walk
as they walk ill pay it back to you saturday on the level i will
give a guy a break will you
ive got to get it back in my account
if helen ever finds out that i unsympathetically baby i cant give you anything but love
camera trucks with them as charlie pushes his truck forward and matt walks alongside of him
en route camera takes in atmospheric shots of the general activity backstage of the bank
male and female clerks stand around at various angles checking away at adding machines
several are assisted by someone who calls off figures to them as they record it on machines
we hear these figures read in a monotone as we pass them
matt is still trying to pry the ten dollars loose from charlie
now listen charlie
ill give you an i
ill give you a note ill pay your mortgage its a matter of life and death ad lib conversations from the other clerks distract his attention
itll be yours if you dont kick in with that ten bucks
say pal did you ever hear of a depression
charlie arrives at his cage
camera stops with them
come over and see us sometime
camera continues to follow matt as he continues on to his cage muttering half to himself
im not asking you to pay off the depression
im only asking you for ten bucks
another teller is busy in the cage next to him
matt addresses him referring to charlie
that mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar
yeah what did he do with his first one
bought himself a pocketbook
the teller laughs heartily
the camera picks up helen as she crosses the main floor of the bank reaches matts teller window and pushes it open
conspiratorially matt come here
come here honey
he leans over and she gives him a quick kiss
hey look out somebodys likely to see us
already walking away oh is that so
she quickly kisses him again crosses back and takes the grand stairs up to the outer office of the bank president as matt watches with a grin
just then a group of five or six important looking men enter scene on the way to the conference room
one of the men looks towards helens desk
on helen and a secretary standing next to her
to helen oh oh
look whos here
the other clerks and tellers noticing the newcomers as they file past
five ill winds
standing next to oscar and blowing no good for the old man either
shooting toward helen
acidly the four and a half horsemen
what are they doing here
theres no board meeting today
by this time the important group of men have reached helen and are passing her by with perfunctory nods
the most important of the important looking men to helen mr
dickson in yet
not yet mr
when he comes in tell him were waiting for him in the board room
and tell him not to delay
the group of men file through the board room door and out of sight
to helen looks like trouble for your boss
takes more than two tons of directors to make trouble for my boss
as she turns to go sez you
taking in all of room
the directors are all here and some sit around a long narrow mahogany table
clark the sour faced old
bird we saw previously talking to helen paces back and forth agitatedly
ive sent for the cashier gentlemen
he has a list of the loans that dickson made last month
as he stops in his pacing a moment and addresses the directors further and as i told you at breakfast it is time we did something about it
in thorough accord with clarks violent attitude is schultz a german whose instinctive conservatism rebels against dicksons liberal banking methods
dickson will ruin this bank if we dont stop him
another conservative stalwart looks to me as if were in hot water already
a very dignified but meek little old man jonathan ives tries horning in feeble voiced gentlemen i was just wondering as another of the directors obrien a large bull faced
thunderous voiced contractor rises to dicksons defense
obrien is always filing his nails even while he talks
personally i think youre getting panic stricken about nothing
dicksons all right
interrupting oh is he
we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city
were fools to tolerate it
thats what i say
and the only way to end it is to get dickson out
he looks toward schultz
dont make me laugh schultz
dickson doesnt have to go
but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do
what good will that do
why it will take control away from him
well put somebody else in charge call in all doubtful loans and be on safe ground again
thats what good it will do
including ives in scene with clark and obrien
ives is seated obrien and clark standing by table
ives tries to speak again
it has just occurred to me interrupting youre wasting your time i tell you
dickson wont stand for it
hell stand for it if i have anything to say about it
just then they hear door open and they all look towards door leading thru to main floor
as he shuts the door behind him
he is immaculately groomed obviously cuts quite a dash with the women
he looks off toward the men as clarks voice comes in ah come in cluett
camera pans with cluett as he comes forward and puts a paper on the table before clark
heres the list
yes thank you
cluett exits toward door again
clark picks up the list and looks at it
then he addresses the other men look at this
just look at this
henry moore thirty six thousand
manny goldberg eighty five hundred
tony consero fifty six thousand dollars
joseph mcdonald eighteen thousand
alvin jones sixty six thousand dollars to a hotel thats on its last legs
i tell you people get loans in this bank that couldnt borrow five cents anywhere else
as the other men group around the loan list which clark has put back down on the table
they all scrutinize it carefully
to the men at large and on what
hunches he calls it
some day hell get a hunch about a man and give the bank away
hes almost done that already
our chief teller matt brown is an example of that
he breaks into dicksons house holds him up and the next day gets a job in the bank
well as far as im concerned a boy who should be in jail handling a banks cash
shooting toward matt inside the tellers cage busily counting the money he is getting ready for charlie
helen is outside the cage
shooting toward helen
skeptically what did you do with it
the ten dollars
quickly oh ten dollars yes
catches himself in time a friend of mine yeah really his mother was terribly sick and she was dying would you believe it
shooting toward matt
as she interrupts him
oh you think im lying
all right im lying
dont forget you called me a liar
he reaches forward and takes her hands
oh honey why dont we get married
then you can handle it all
just then oscar enters the scene en route somewhere
he stops beside matt notices he and helen are holding hands
as helen and matt separate guiltily
did you hear the news
all the big shots are in a huddle and it looks like dicksons out on his ear
helen and matt react to this piece of news
they look at one another
apparently it will have a definite effect on their lives
to oscar oh youre kidding me arent you
no im not kidding
everybodys talking about it
i havent heard about it
sure everybodys talking about it
as he speaks sadly
if thats on the level there goes my assistant cashiers job
taking the three in
well i just thought id drop by and cheer you up a bit
as he turns to go out of scene he looks at matt
ill be seeing you matt in the breadline
the men are all gathered around the table now
apparently they have been discussing ways and means of ousting dickson
as we cut to this scene ives is pouring himself a glass of water
that ham i had this morning was very salty gentlemen lets get organized before dickson gets here
schultz can i count on you
on schultz who is seated next to clark
what about you ames
on ames who is seated next to schultz
thats the way i feel about it
ives how about you
well the way i look at it it seems that interrupting all right
at other end of table where obrien is
well youve got an awful fight on your hands
thats all ive got to say
on clark determined
gentlemen i think its time that we do fight
the outer offices of the bank are in this shot
a spacious stretch of desks occupied by clerks and junior officers all busily at work
a wizened old doorman is greeting clerks as they arrive
passing by hello gardiner
youre on time this morning
its about time
we see dickson looming in the doorway for the first time
as dickson stops to speak to the doorman
dickson is a man of about fifty whose looks belie his years
there is a robustness and virility about him that is compelling
his very walk radiates power
he now puts his hand on the old mans shoulder
good morning mr
john hows your wife this morning
looking up worship in his eyes much better this morning thank you
got a handkerchief
gardiner hurriedly produces a handkerchief and starts to blow his nose
excuse me wait a minute
he takes the handkerchief and polishes the brass on gardiners uniform how do you feel this morning
im feeling fine this morning
that makes it unanimous
i feel all right too
as dickson exits from scene
the smile on his face disappears as he sees something which annoys him
sternly oh carter
a young man looks up quickly
he is smoking a cigarette
you know the rules about smoking
carter quickly crushes out the cigarette
even as he does so dickson reaches into his pocket and flips carter a fresh one which carter pockets for later
thank you sir
now dickson passes matts cage
catching matts attention oh matt
matt looks up
dickson tosses him a wink and matt winks back
dickson walks on towards his office
camera trucks ahead of him
on the way he is greeted by his employees
good morning mr
good morning he is joined by bill saunders a friend of his
bill walks along with dickson
firmly but pleasantly you here again
what do you want
he does not stop
continues his walk toward his office
bill along side of him
smiling what do you suppose anybody wants
money money money
listen i told you i wasnt interested in that deal didnt i
i want to know why
dickson notices a man a janitor without a uniform passing by
to the man wait a minute
wheres your uniform
i havent any
you havent got a uniform
my goodness you ought to have a uniform
how much does one cost
why i dont know
you see sampson
tell him i sent you
youve got to have a uniform
the man exits scene
bill picks up the conversation where he left off
tom i never had trouble getting credit from you before
when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted
now i come to you with a swell deal and the greatest interrupting ill tell you why
i dont like the crowd youre mixed up with
softening personally you can have all the credit you want
but for that deal not a cent
but listen tom i they have now reached the anteroom of dicksons private chamber where helen sits at her desk
as dickson comes up to helen at her desk
a lady sits nearby
dickson notices her
good morning mrs
good morning mr
got my letter
yes thank you
helen youre becoming more beautiful every day
what are we going to do about it
i dont know
guess well just have to sacrifice the bank
when are you and matt going to get married
awkwardly why well i ummm
changing tone professionally anything new
why the directors are waiting for you in the board room
he gestures accordingly
she trumps his gesture longer
half under his breath i havent got any new stories for them this morning either
pembroke has been standing by waiting to get a word in edgewise
camera pans slightly with him to take in the lady mr
i spoke to mr
schaffer at the guaranty
hes going to take care of that mortgage for you
during this speech the phone bell rings
as helen picks up the phone and quietly answers it
bill saunders is standing nearby still waiting to talk to dickson again
into phone hello
she turns to dickson mrs
dickson on the phone
dickson comes over to the desk and as he picks up the receiver he looks toward mrs
pembroke youd better hurry over there
hes waiting for you
then into phone hello dear
as he continues into phone where are you
sure well come on down right away
yes of course i remember
smiles see what a social hound im becoming
all right goodbye dear
he hangs up
pembroke is waiting for him to finish
she has apparently been disappointed in the news he has for her
dickson i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage
i only want ten thousand
the property is worth sixty
ill at ease mr
schaffer will take good care of you
hell give you fifteen maybe twenty
he continues talking to the lady trying to get rid of her
better hurry now
good luck to you
pembroke bewildered starts to leave
muttering thank you
camera pans with him as mrs
to helen oh if mrs
dickson comes in will you tell her to see cluett if she needs any money
bill saunders is still waiting
he corners dickson
whats the idea of turning her down
it sounds like a perfectly safe investment
shes a widow
i dont like taking mortgages from widows
puzzled why not
shooting toward dickson
if she cant pay ill have to foreclose wont i
dumbly yes sure mimicking him yeah sure
he turns to address a man below the janitor without a uniform
oh make that uniform blue
abruptly he heads for the board room
bill is still baffled by dicksons queer reasoning
suddenly it dawns on him
he shakes his head admiringly
blithely as he counts the board members present one two three four five
seven more and youd have a jury
he grabs a walking cane and wields it like a golf putter
well its a nice morning gentlemen
how about two foursomes of golf
eagerly oh i say that would be
ivess voice trails off as he realizes clark is scowling at him
undeterred still practicing his golf swing say you know i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball
youve got to hit with the left hand and from the inside out its the only way you can hit anything
huffy i think mr
dickson we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning if you dont mind
oh you would eh
if its more important than golf go ahead
whats on your mind
shooting from one end of the lobby toward the front door
depositors are scattered all over the place
some at the windows
some at the writing tables
others sitting inside the railing talking to junior executives
the scene is peaceful though very active
camera starts trucking forward passing en route the different types of individuals who frequent the bank
people from all walks of life
camera travels slowly picking up following little scenes
at window the check is no good
the check is no good
the man has no account here
ive been robbed
im sorry madam
so am i
and dont call me madam
camera next picks up an elderly lady talking to a bank guard
yes maam you can deposit your money here
is it safe
its his life insurance money you know
thats all right
you come with me and ill show you where to deposit your money
camera goes past and now singles out three men who are coming forward
one glance and we know they are here for no kosher reason
they are typical gangster types
one of them the leader is dressed in everything but the kitchen sink
light fedora stiff shirt and collar with stripes running perpendicularly
flashy gray suit spats and walking stick
the other two are just tough hombres but dressed to kill
as they walk toward camera they glance around the bank with a professional casualness but obviously very much impressed
their eyes rove around the place and finally land on some object where they stop
as he quickly counts out several thousand dollars in bills
their eyes glisten
their mouths water as they watch charlie off scene
inside the railing
cluett emerges from his office and starts forward business like when he suddenly stops in his tracks
he stares off at the racketeers
a look of fright comes into his eyes
his impulse is to turn back
the three gangsters
a quick flash
their eyes light on cluett off scene and they glare menacingly at him
there he is
he changes his mind about avoiding them
his face breaks into a feeble smile of affability as he walks toward them
camera pans with him as he approaches the three men his hand outstretched in forced amiability
shaking good morning
who do you want to see
the gangsters shake hands with him their expressions remaining unchanged which adds immeasurably to cluetts discomfort
we wanna talk to you about a big deal
there is a sinister significance in the manner in which he emphasizes a big deal
cluett is perceptibly ill at ease
uncertainly sickly smile oh yes
well come right this way
he opens the swinging gate in front of him permitting the three racketeers to enter
they start for cluetts office
helen sits at her typewriter near a railing overlooking the bank below
another girl stands by her both are staring off scene
from helens angle
cluett and the three gangsters going into cluetts office
helen and other secretary
hey pat come here
to helen thats dude finlay all right ive seen his picture in the papers hundreds of times
i wonder what hes doing with mr
still staring thrilled shuddering gee im scared
hes one of the toughest gangsters in town
shooting down the length of the table
the men are all sitting around the large table
dickson is on his feet
firmly gentlemen youre only wasting your time
therell be no merger
as dickson continues
the injustice kills him why should i turn this bank over to anybody else
ive worked twenty five years night and day to build it up and now youre asking me to dump it into somebodys lap with finality nothing doing
schultz who is seated near dickson looks up at him you can make a handsome profit on your stock
im not interested in profits
im interested in the bank
in the depositors
theyre my friends
theyre looking to me for protection and im not walking out on them
clark and obrien also seated around close to dickson
how are you protecting your depositors
by making a lot of idiotic loans
admonishing him take it easy clark
ives seated next to schultz becomes alarmed
still trying my dear friends
unruffled paying no attention to ives its all right
let him go ahead
let him speak his piece
i like it
ill speak my piece
dickson youve got to change your policy
as dickson retorts whats the matter with my policy
how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty five years
he looks around silence ill tell you
not a single one
defiantly whats wrong with that kind of banking
mumbles disdainfully just pure luck
ames seated beyond ives now speaks up conditions have changed
these are precarious times
banks today have got to be careful
and youve been more liberal than ever
dicksons voice comes in over scene yes and im going to continue to be liberal
as he continues
the trouble with this country today is theres too much hoarded cash
idle money is no good to industry
where is all the money today
in the banks vaults socks old tin cans buried in the ground
i tell you weve got to get the money in circulation before youll get this country back to prosperity
who are we going to give it to
men like jones
last week you made him an extra loan of fifty thousand dollars
do you call that intelligent banking
he cant pay his bills
how do you expect him to pay us
thats a fair question schultz
now lets see how bad a risk jones is
whats his history
hes been a successful business man for thirty five years
two years ago business started falling off
today jones needs money and if he doesnt get it he goes into bankruptcy and throws nine hundred men out of work
as he listens intently dicksons voice coming in it also means his creditors arent paid
theyre in trouble
they go to banks and are turned down
more bankruptcies as he continues its a vicious circle my friends and the only place to cure it is right here at the source
help jones and you help the whole circle
now when jones comes to me i ask myself two questions
first is he honest
second is he as good a business man as he was before
and the answer is hes better
showing his reaction as part of dicksons speech comes over scene he is not only older and wiser but his present trouble has taught him precaution
in my estimation gentlemen jones is no risk
neither are the thousands of other joneses throughout the country
to intercut with dicksons speech
to intercut with dicksons speech
to intercut with dicksons speech
the group as dickson concludes his speech
its they who built this nation up to the richest in the world and its up to the banks to give them a break
disraeli said security is the prosperity of the nation cutting him off why disraeli didnt say anything of the kind
well he should have said it
its as true now as it was then
and let us get the right kind of security
not stocks and bonds that zig zag up and down not collateral on paper but character
indignantly character hmmpf
thats your idea
not at all
thats alexander hamiltons idea the finest banking mind this country has ever known
those are his exact words gentlemen
its the only thing you can bank on and its the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums
cluett sits at his desk his face drawn panic stricken
he is like an animal at bay
the leader of the trio dude finlay sits in a chair directly in front of cluett
the other two men stand on either side of the desk
menacingly you know what we do to welchers cluett dont you
trembling i know i know dude
oh i must have been crazy
i lost my head completely
thats your funeral
weve got fifty thousand dollars comin to us
helplessly i havent got it
shooting past cluett
barking then what did you want to gamble for
if youd have beat us out of fifty gs youd have been paid wouldnt you
well we want our dough
im sorry dude buti that dont do us any good
but after all you cant take blood from a stone
threateningly quietly we can take blood from anything pauses if its comin to us
shooting toward cluett
dude on opposite side of desk the other two men still standing by the desk
a look of alarm spreads over cluetts face
there is nothing hidden in this threat
wants time to think perhaps if youll wait a little while i might be able snappily we waited long enough
shrewdly to the men nix
to cluett now whats the use of getting excited cluett
it oughta be easy for you to lay your mitts on that kind of dough shooting past dude as dude continues slowly deliberately theres plenty of it in this bank
laying around loose
cluett looks up horror stricken
pop eyed choked voice good heavens man
youre not suggesting that i why not
perspiring freely why i couldnt do that
flatly you dont have to do nothing
cluett looks up toward the men then at dude
slowly what do you mean
all you gotta do is fix a few things for us and well do the rest see
there is a pause while cluett stares at them horrified his confused mind trying to assimilate the ghastliness of their proposal
suddenly he starts to rise
as cluett gets to his feet and faces dude across the desk
no no i couldnt i couldnt do anything like that
the rest of his speech dies in his throat
the man to his right has slapped him across the face with his open palm
taken unaware cluetts hand goes to his cheek
he stares at them bewildered and frightened
cluett feeling himself trapped and helpless slowly sinks into his chair
helen sits at her typewriter
a very dignified beautiful woman of thirty approaches her
she is phyllis dickson dicksons wife
she radiates refinement and culture
pleasantly good morning helen
at helens desk as helen looks up at mrs
how do you do mrs
is that busy husband of mine busy
indicating conference room hes at a board meeting
not unexpected board meeting
oh that means hours i suppose
im afraid so
helen did you ever try competing with a bank
well take my word for it and dont try it
if it were some other woman i could handle her but after all you cant scratch a banks eyes out now can you
shooting past helen
i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite
when he comes out you tell him ill be back
he hasnt gotten rid of me
helen laughs as mrs
dickson leaves in the direction of cluetts office
the three racketeers are preparing to leave
dude has his hand on the doorknob
nervously dude theres not any chance of my becoming involved in this is there
no youll be all right so long as you establish an alibi for tonight
i know but be sure youre with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked
but dude listen couldnt we make this some other time
positively listen buddy youre getting by pretty easy
cluett looks at dude then at the others and realizes he is helpless
he opens the door and the men file out silently
cluett shuts the door and camera pans with him as he crosses back to his desk shaking perceptibly
he reaches into a desk drawer and extracts a bottle of liquor
as he takes a drink mrs
dickson enters unannounced
dickson stands watching cluett
playful reproach oh oh
cluett turns quickly
upon seeing her he makes an attempt to conceal the terror he feels
smiling feebly oh hello phyllis
she advances toward him as he rises
shaking her head this wont do
not during business hours why i needed a offering her drink want one
screwing up her face heavens no
do you mind putting up with me until the financial genius gets thru genius ing
no no of course not
not at all
as she takes out a cigarette he offers her a light
dickson notices that he is rather nervous
what is the matter with you
trying to be light am i
why i i dont know any reason why i should be unless of course its you
being alone with you has always done this to me
you know that
for a celebrated bounder that is an awful admission
besides i never knew that any female could do this to you well you can
you always could
youre just suffering from lack of sleep
he takes this as premature defeat and heads back toward his desk
good natured admonishment here here here now
dont you go back to work on me too
im getting tired of this
besides its beginning to affect your looks not understanding what is
finishing her little joke running around
not your work
cluett laughs in relief youd better start reforming cyril
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested i would
not bad not bad at all
do you know something
ive always been curious about your line
whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women
he shrugs off the compliment
continuing come on cyril try a little bit of it out on me
i havent had any first class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married
trying hard but you see it isnt blarney where youre concerned
laughs now let me see what comes next
a mocking tone oh yes i know what are you doing tonight phyllis
he is suddenly reminded of his pact with dude finlay
terror returns to his face
he suddenly gets an idea
he was told to be with someone around midnight
someone who would be an alibi for him
he stares off at phyllis dickson
continuing doesnt that come next
yes yes it does
what are you doing tonight phyllis
see were getting along famously
clark is in a state of agitation
the other directors seem worn by the ordeal
dickson remains adamant
most of the creditors i know personally
ive seen them grow up in the community
i knew their fathers and mothers before them
i know dickson
thats all very well
but youre taking too many chances
in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble
in case of emergency
all the men in the scene
i know what you mean by that
you want me to hang on to our cash
well i dont believe in it
the law demands that i carry a certain legal reserve and im doing it
the rest of our money is out working
working to help industry
to help build up business
as he almost shouts at dickson
in the meantime youre jeopardizing the safety of the bank
well we wont stand for it
of the group as dickson turns to clark
you have to stand for it
meek little ives once again tries to say something exhausted but my dear friends
interrupting youre forcing us to take action against you dickson
dickson looks at him go ahead take all the action you want
he looks about at the others as he continues im running this bank my way
get that clear
gentlemen you notice mr
dickson refuses to consider our wishes
he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground
he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as
you said it clark
thats the only thing that means anything to me
as dicksons voice continues
clark reacts appropriately
before i take a man into this bank and before i extend credit to anyone i satisfy myself on one thing do i believe in him
on the other men camera panning from one to the other as dicksons voice comes over the shot finally camera stops on dickson
so far my judgement has been right one hundred per cent
one hundred per cent
when i start going wrong you wont have to take any action
ill turn the bank over to you
then you can
merge all you want to
i wont be the fellow to run it then
good day gentlemen
he exits scene
camera trucks ahead of him as dickson passes briskly through his outer office stopping only to speak to helen at her desk cheerfully helen tell matt i want to see
mid stream and after dinner we could go not at all angry oh
i think ive done enough experimenting for one day
youve convinced me that youre a philanderer of the very first order
i shall recommend you highly
simply please please dont laugh at me phyllis
i must see you tonight
tonight oh never
tonight i have reserved for a very special occasion
believe it or not its our wedding anniversary
tom doesnt probably even remember it
but then they never do do they
no they dont she shakes her head
but im giving a party for him a real old fashioned surprise party
caps bells whistles and everything
im really terribly excited about it
ive been planning it for months
after a pause well smiling well what
he wont give up well arent you going to invite me
no can do
its all set
just a few of toms closest friends
now phyllis if you dont invite me im coming anyway
dont be silly cyril
these are respectable people
theyd probably bore you to death
desperate sounding no they wont
not when you are there
oh please be a sport
please ask me
flattered but a little suspicious why are you so anxious
intense sincerity dont you know
i want to be near you
he steps closer to her
dont you know ive been crazy about you for years
still flattered lightly now wait a minute wait a minute
ive loved you ever since i can remember long before you married tom dickson
still only half believing why cyril youre insane no
no im not
i deliberately avoided you
i was afraid of making a fool of myself
but i wont stand it any longer cyril
before she realizes what has happened he has swept her into his arms and crushes her to him
camera pans away from them to the door to the outer office
the door opens and matt steps in
he stops suddenly transfixed by what he sees off scene
phyllis dickson in cluetts arms from matts angle
they suddenly become conscious of someone in the room and phyllis struggles free looking off scene toward matt from cluett and mrs
he stares unbelievingly for a moment and then collecting himself turns and leaves the room closing the door after him
camera pans back to cluett and mrs
for a moment she is terribly upset
please forgive me phyllis
i lost my head for a minute
but i couldnt help it phyllis
as she starts for the door camera pans with her
cluett walks with her
please stop apologizing so much
youre making it far too important
as they reach the door
matt stands there in a daze
cluetts secretary is not there
he starts slowly forward hardly knowing where he is going camera trucking ahead of him there is a far away look in his eyes
his hand clutches the list of payrolls but as far as he is concerned it is entirely forgotten
several people talk to him but matt walks on heedlessly
he cant get over the shock of what he just saw
he always had been under the impression that dicksons home life was a happy one
he never dreamed that phyllis dickson represented anything but the height of circumspection
and now cyril cluett of all people
helen comes running into scene all excited
happily matt where have you been
dickson wants to see you right away
he turns around mechanically and continues to walk in the direction of dicksons office camera trucking after him
helen falls into step with him
say i just heard the merger isnt going thru
isnt that grand
tonelessly yeah swell
they reach dicksons outer office
matt crosses it and exits into the private office
helen looks after him her face falls in disappointment
matt is acting very strangely
she thought hed be elated
she stares unhappily at his forlorn figure as it disappears thru the door
dickson sits at his desk when matt enters
when he sees matt his face breaks into a broad pleasant smile
grandly well matt get ready for the big moment
starting tomorrow you become assistant cashier
matt crosses to the desk as dickson is speaking
as matt stops in front of dickson
matt cannot share dicksons enthusiasm
the scene he just witnessed has taken the joy out of everything
its all right
and whats more keep up the good work and who knows some day youll be the fellow sitting behind that desk
the idea pleases him not a bad thought eh
he suddenly notices matts lack of enthusiasm
shooting toward dickson
he leans forward to look at matt closely whats the matter
you dont seem very excited about it
feebly sure i think its swell
scrutinizing him closely very much hurt say come on
show a little enthusiasm
whats the matter
are you sick or something
go on fake it even if it isnt real
shooting past dickson
matt makes an attempt to snap out of it and answers quickly
aw im sorry mr
its just kind of sudden thats all
working up a little enthusiasm sure im excited
i think its great
only well youve done so much for me already
ill never be able to thank you enough
aw go on forget it
you came through didnt you
thats all i wanted
a lot of them didnt think you would
you dont know how much satisfaction its been to me
its been swell
well when are you and helen going to get married
well i i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too eh
they are interrupted by the sudden appearance of phyllis dickson
both men look up as she appears in the door
as she stops in doorway
she glances fearfully first at matt and then at her husband trying to sense whether matt has said anything
she is quickly assured by dicksons affable greeting
as dickson comes toward her arms extended well look whos here
he kisses her
then throws his arms around her for an exaggerated teddybear hug
over dicksons shoulder phyllis looks gratefully at matt
he returns her glance
his eyes are unable to disguise his contempt
dickson and phyllis
he releases her
if this isnt a red letter day for tom dickson
first i trample on the board of directors then i promote matt here to assistant cashier and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and
lovely and gorgeous wife
what a man what a man
with a half smile its amazing that your sweet lovely gorgeous wife can ever get to see you
that has the earmarks
he notices matt still standing there uncomfortably
good naturedly are you still here
go on go to work
what do you think i pay you for
as matt comes out and moves quickly forward as if anxious to get away from the embarrassing situation he found himself in
helen upon seeing him jumps up
excitedly what happened
what did he say
did you get the job
she is perplexed by his unenthusiastic attitude
whats the matter matt
gee i thought youd be thrilled to death
he takes her aside you know a few minutes ago i was in cluetts office and mrs
dickson was there
well he was making love to her
helen although she had a vague suspicion is shocked
after a pause oh matt you must be mistaken
i tell you i saw them
helen stares at him horrified
in cluetts office
yes right in his office the rat
id like to take a crack at that guy
a telephone rings
as she goes to answer the phone wait a minute
now dont go away
dickson is seated with mrs
dickson on the arm of the chair
talking on the phone as mrs dickson waits patiently yes george
oh thats for tonight eh
yes certainly ill be there
yes well go down together and have dinner in philadelphia mrs
dickson gets so upset
just as soon as the bank closes
he punches the intercom speaks to helen in the outer office
helen im going to philadelphia just as soon as the bank closes

dickson looks visibly upset
dickson cant help but notice
whats the matter dear
what have i done now
tom i thought you were going out with me tonight
oh i did have a date with you tonight didnt i
im terribly sorry
id forgotten all about you
im so sorry dear
favoring phyllis dickson
now tom you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight
thats all there is to it
but i have to go dear
its a very important bankers meeting
interrupting i dont care whether its important or not
you said you were going out with me and if you hadnt promised so faithfully i wouldnt have gone and planned the whole thing
listen it isnt so terribly important
we can go to the theatre any time
thats what it was you planned wasnt it
after a slight hesitation yes of course
you can take some of the girls
you can take mildred or gwynn the girls
i dont suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man
shooting toward dickson as he laughs boisterously
ho ho ho yourself
i wouldnt laugh if i were you
you may not suspect it but im still attractive to some
listen dont go around being attractive to anyone but me
dont you forget that im still the head man around here too
now well get the tickets changed for tomorrow night
you and i are going out together
a buzzer sounds and a visitor is announced on the intercom
answering the intercom oh yes
thats that lawyer
all right let him have nine thousand
returning attention to his wife yes sir ill step you around this town like youve never stepped before
we will have dinner at the st
regis then well go to a nice snappy show then a nightclub well listen to soft music and who knows
i might break down and dance with you
still skeptical all right
ill postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night
assuringly happy now
mock pouting no
he takes her in his arms and kisses her
tenderly poor kid you know i have been neglecting you
oh i dont care darling
i love you anyway
a buzzer sounds again and dickson answers the intercom
send him in
there is a knock on the door
dickson moves away from his wife
he looks toward the door
sampson an executive in the bank enters
sampson goes to dickson with some papers in his hand
he lays the papers on the desk before dickson
well sampson what is it
heres the data on the clyde deal
dickson is all absorbed
ill take this along with me
tell clyde ill see him tomorrow
im sick and tired of the delay
im afraid hes been stalling
thats just exactly what he has been doing
this deal should have been closed weeks ago
tell him to keep tomorrow open
he says he cant get away in the daytime
how about his nights
hes too busy running around
tell him to keep tomorrow night open come in and sign this thing or ill call this whole deal off
she stands by a window listening
there is despair in her look as she hears him making arrangements for tomorrow night
dicksons voice comes over this shot im sick and tired of these people dilly dallying
people who cant make up their minds mrs
dicksons eyes close hopelessly and she feels defeated
again shut out from his scheme of things she realizes he is incurable
on this picture of resignation insert clock over the vault reading camera pans down to open vault
inside several of the tellers are putting their cash away
one of them is just entering with his truck
i guess so
amused charlies upstairs as sore as a pup
hes out fourteen cents and he cant find it
good night matt
cyril cluett is standing at the bottom of a spiral staircase from which he has just descended
he stops a second and watches matt off scene
cluett has gloves on his hat in his hand preparatory to going home
matt does not see charlie
matt and helen standing near the vault door
whats keeping you
oh charlie again
say matt you havent done anything about what you saw today have you
still upset who
no not yet
but id like to take a crack at that stiff necked horse dollar
oh now dont be silly
disgusted can you imagine that guy
he was kissing her
now youve got me worried dear
she kisses him promise me you wont butt in
okay honey but just the same id like to take a crack at that she puts her hand over her mouth shh
whispering ill wait for you upstairs
all right dear
matt remains standing a far away look in his eyes
it is obvious he is thinking about the thing seriously
the boys who were inside the vault now file out having properly locked away their cash
at the same time charlie wheels in his truck
kidding him where you been
annoyed where do you think ive been
pointing to truck i took the baby for a stroll in the park
the men hurry out of sight laughing
charlie disappears into the vault
matt enters the vault his mind still preoccupied
as matt goes directly to the burglar alarm
as matts hand comes into scene and throws the switch down toward sign reading matt starts to the vault door whats the matter charlie
im fourteen cents out and it took me half an hour to find the mistake
and me with a date too
i remember once when your account checked
matt goes to the time clock to check it up
he tinkers with it a moment
matt has just finished adjusting the time clock as charlie comes out of the vault
pointing to time clock and listen wise guy im setting friend time clock for exactly nine oclock so no squawks out of you guys in the morning
as he exits say dont annoy me
i got troubles of my own
he starts to shut the vault
he has it swinging half way around when cluett enters
when matt sees cluett the smile dies on his lips
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow
peremptorily let me see your cash book will you
matt looks at him a moment antagonistically
he has half a mind to talk to him right now but he recalls helens admonitions and thinks better of it
all right sir
he exits into vault
the moment he is gone cluett crosses quickly to the time clock
as cluetts gloved hand comes in and turns the indicator back to oclock
matt has opened a compartment and has brought out several sheets of paper
he goes thru them to find the one he wants
cluetts hand is seen throwing the switch up to indicator reading off
as matt comes up to cluett with a cash report
cluett glances over it
returning sheet thats all right
but it seems to me youre carrying too much cash
matt glares belligerently at him
camera pans with him as he returns the paper to compartment
he locks the compartment door switches off the light in vault and camera pans with him as he starts out of the vault
as he swings the large vault door closed as a cab drives up to curb in the middle of a downpour and stops
they are in evening clothes apparently they had some drinks as phyllis is in a gay frivolous mood
to driver driver
have you the correct time
looking out whats this
mock melodramatic i knew i couldnt trust you
you told me you were taking me home
come on up for just a few minutes
well have just one drink then well go
i know the answer to that one
shaking her head i think youd better take me home
whats the matter
afraid papa will spank
no im afraid papa isnt that much interested
hes too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy old speeches at stuffy old bankers meetings
too busy closing big important deals on second thought i think i will have a drink
good for you
cluett and mrs
dickson emerge from the elevator and cross to his apartment camera following them
cluett fumbles in his pocket for the key
you know there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you
americas comfort to misunderstood wives
i never thought i would find myself in that class
oh youre not so badly off
theres something much worse than being a misunderstood wife
what is that mr
a misunderstood bachelor
he has the door open by now and stands aside to permit her to enter
phyllis dickson has just stepped in and cluett follows
he closes the door and locks it
mock melodramatic and now fair woman i have you in my power
playing along im not afraid of you
you havent got a moustache
ill grow a moustache by the time you get out of here
camera trucks with them as he chases her into the next room
she alights on a piano bench and runs her fingers up and down the scales
suddenly cluett stops
he stares off a look of amazement in his face
dickson turns and follows his gaze and she too is startled
camera pans quickly over to the other side of the room
matt sits on the edge of a chair waiting for them
he rises looks off toward cluett and mrs
as he starts forward camera pans back to cluett and phyllis
when he recovers from his surprise what are you doing here
matt enters the scene
the butler said i could stay
i told him it was important
cluett steps over to a bell cord and pulls it
hes not here
he left at nine oclock
he said you gave him the night off
cluett wheels around infuriated
what do you want
uncomfortably well i thought id like to have a little talk with you
sharply im listening
hesitatingly its funny now that im here i dont know just how to go about it
a glance toward mrs
dickson you see i kind of expected to find you here alone
as cluett starts away do you mind stepping outside
we could talk cluett crosses to the door where he stands ready to open it
dickson stands by helplessly
a tone of dismissal anything you have to say to me you can say in the morning
oh no mr
cluett if its all the same to you id rather not wait
its about you and mrs
cluett releases his hold on the doorknob
dickson looks at matt uneasily she is quickly sobering
aghast about me and
he crosses slowly toward matt
why matt what are you talking about
quickly i know ive got a lot of nerve butting in like this but i just couldnt help it
i thought i could stop two people from doing something theyd be sorry for
livid im not interested in what you think
youve no right to do this to her mr
why dont you think it over
its only gonna get you into a lot of trouble
i tell you im not interested in your opinion
turns to phyllis no
then maybe youll understand mrs
oh gee hes crazy about you
nobody knows it better than you
if he ever finds out itll kill him
but matt youre mistaken about the whole thing
there isnt anything wrong
cluett and i simply came here shooting toward matt
to phyllis phyllis you dont have to explain anything
snappily to matt youd do well to mind your own business
wheeling on him this is my business
dicksons been like a father to me
his voice rising what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this
livid that will be just about enough
now get out of here
i guess i have said enough bitterly im just wasting my breath talking to you
taking in mrs
dickson who stands slightly apart from the two men
youre right for the first time
now get out
matt ignores cluett and looks toward phyllis dickson
im appealing to you mrs
think what youre doing to him
youre passing up the whitest man on earth flaring up for a dirty no good
before he finishes the sentence cluett punches him
matt caught unawares is thrown off balance and sent reeling
he drops between two chairs
now livid with rage he pulls himself up murder in his eyes
cluett crosses quickly to a desk near the door opens a drawer and extracts a revolver
frightened cries out cyril
matt who was started toward cluett stops in his tracks upon seeing the gun
shooting toward cluett
under his breath now get out of here
camera pans with matt to the door
wait a minute matt
matt turns as she enters the scene
ill go with you
dickson steps closer to matts side
cluett comes up to them
you neednt go on account of this idiot
matt has opened the door
quietly you better carry that around with you all the time youre going to need it
matt follows mrs
dickson out leaving cluett glaring after them
a series of quick vignettes cluetts watch showing
a wall clock showing
a night watchman alerted by suspicious noise creeping up to the vault
the night watchman shot by figures in the shadows
a small number of men rush out of the vault clutching money bags and toting guns
the night watchman getting off a shot before he crumples to the floor
the vault door partly opened
over the shot we hear excited murmurs
until it takes in the full room
a fingerprint expert is working on the time clock for finger print impressions
the medical examiner bends over the body of the watchman whose face is covered with a cloth
a detective in charge of the proceedings stands around looking very officious
what do you say doc
oh id say about eight or nine hours
well youd better call the coroner
camera continues trucking back until it passes a group of tellers and clerks in a huddle
they listen breathlessly as oscar the youngest of the tellers relates his story
for the moment he is the center of attraction and he revels in it
breathlessly i was the first one to see it
i was coming down the stairs and there was the dead watchman at my feet
you coulda knocked me over with a pin
can you imagine
do you see that clock
thats where the bullet hit
when i saw that you coulda knocked me over with a pin
was there much blood
gesturing toward body come on over fellas
ill show you
the clerks head toward the dead body but are intercepted by the officious detective
officiously get back there
i dont want anything touched until the inspector gets here
the clerks awe stricken retreat
running up oscar whats the matter
i was the first one to see it
i was coming down the stairs and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet
when i saw it you coulda knocked me over with a pin
hell have a tough time thinking up a wise crack for this one
the detectives got matt up there in sampsons office
say did matt do it
dont look at me
i dont know
say he did look kinda funny yesterday didnt you notice it
yeah he did
i noticed it too
you coulda knocked me over with a pin
he sits in a chair
the side of his face is swollen from cyril cluetts punch of the night before
like a tri hammer come on come on
you might as well tell me the truth
what did you do with the money
i didnt do it
i told you all i know inspector
camera trucks back revealing the other occupants of the room
the inspector leans over matt firing questions at him
two detectives are also there one at the door the other near matt
helen stands in a corner pale and fearful looking on
you turned off the burglar alarm you set the time clock came back at twelve and emptied the boxes didnt you
rises in indignation i wasnt anywhere near this place shoving him back down sit down
when the watchman surprised you you shot him whatd you do with the gun
desperately i didnt do it
i havent got a gun
you used to carry a gun didnt you
sampson enters hesitantly
pardon me but id like to use my office for awhile
bellowing you use some other office
sampson exits scene hurriedly
the doorman gardiner stands at the door blocking a milling crowd as dickson who apparently has already heard the news enters
come on open up
good morning everybody
whats the matter here
open up the door
come on open this door
shall we let the people come in
snappily of course let them in
youre late now
camera trucks with dickson as he proceeds toward interior of bank
helen rushes into the scene and up to him
camera oh mr
dickson theyre going to arrest matt
they think he did it
where is he now
now dont you worry about it
he crosses in that direction followed by helen
cluett comes out of his office looks around cautiously and satisfied he is unobserved walks toward front door of bank
camera pans over to a corner of the ante room
detective is watching cluett
as cluett leaves the detective follows
matt is still seated with the detectives grilling him
then you did it and you did it alone dickson enters
to matt whats the matter
whats going on here
to the inspector this is ridiculous
you cant hold this boy on a vague suspicion
im afraid i must mr
why pick on him
its an inside job
thats a cinch
whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout
now brown here is in charge of the vaults isnt he
over which comes inspectors voice as he continues the burglar alarm was turned off
the time clock was set for oclock
what more do you want
somebody else could have done it couldnt they
he admits that he set the clock himself
matt looks up toward inspector
i set it for nine oclock this morning
as the inspector turns to matt then who changed it
helplessly i dont know
wait a minute
wait a minute
the inspector turns back to dickson
what time did this thing happen
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at
if the boy proves an alibi hes all right isnt he
if he can do it yes
why certainly he can
to matt matt now all youve got to do is tell them where you were last night between twelve and twelve thirty and everything will be all right
averting dicksons gaze i already told him i was home
to inspector there you are
thats what he says
i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now
to matt smiling youve got nothing to worry about
soon as the report comes in youll be released
to inspector and listen dont talk so loud
take it easy
coast a little
he exits scene
showing the normal activity of the bank in contrast to the turmoil going on inside
just a few people scattered about
camera trucks towards the other end of the lobby establishing the calm and peace of the place along the way
camera stops on a close shot at the bank telephone operator at the switchboard
oscar the young teller is relating his story for the hundredth time
gee what do you think
there was that watchman that poor watchman lying on the floor right in front of me
oh you coulda knocked me over with a pin
wide eyed you dont say
he was lifeless

i was coming down the stairs and there was the watchman lying on the floor right in front of me
i tell you you coulda knocked interrupting yeah i coulda knocked you over with a pin
yeah you coulda realizes he is getting the brush off oh almonds to you
oscar exits scene
the operator turns her attention to the switch board apparently oscar has interrupted a conversation she has been having
this is gert again pause say listen i just heard something thatll make your head swim

yeah the bank was robbed last night
yeah over a hundred thousand dollars
into phone who did it

they was robbed over two hundred thousand dollars
can you beat that
two men coming out of the building engrossed in conversation
stole over a quarter of a million

the other man whistles in surprise
you cant laugh that off
several people in the crowd overhearing them turn and stare
of an old lady pitiful expression begging alms
two gentlemen are beside her
one of them reaches in his pocket for a coin
i thought the union national was pretty solid
at the mention of the union national the old lady looks up startled
i did too
half a million is a lot of money
i wouldnt be surprised if they had to close their doors
the first man drops a coin in the old ladys palm and they leave
the beggar woman oblivious of the coin in her hand stares unbelieving at the departing men
suddenly her face screws up in horror
oh good gracious
she dashes out of scene
a colored bootblack is brushing the coat of a customer
sammy are you sure about that
emphatically yes suh
that messenga boy just tol me that mr
dickson took it all hisself
and it was more than a million dollars
more than a million dollars
breathlessly cross my heart
and i sure hopes that man gets a long time in jail too
never mind my shoes sam
he hastily exits scene
taking in two chairs
the man on the right being shaved is in conversation with the barber
well i always said the union national was a phony bank
the second customer sits straight up in his chair
you had money in that bank too
hysterical mon dieu mon dieu
second customer dashes out of scene
two men are in conversation
another man is alone
one of the two men holding the conversation is the man of the bootblack episode
of bootblack episode i tell you i got it from the best authority
dickson got away with several million dollars
he is just reaching for his glass and starts to lift it to his lips when another mans voice comes into scene
boy thats the end of the union national bank
thats the trouble nowadays
you dont know who you can trust
you said it
the third man drops the glass and turns toward the two panic stricken
say is there something wrong with the union national bank
brother that aint the half of it
if youve got any money in there you can just kiss it goodbye
throatily naw youre kidding no im not
he rushes out of the scene
the other two stare after him
over his shoulder to third man if youve got any friends youd better call them up too
thats a good idea
i have friends of my own
he dashes out of scene
turning to bartender who has been eavesdropping with interest imagine that

quick cuts of excited phone conversations
into phone listen jack go down to the union national and take your money out of there

showing in comparison to previous shot the effect of the rumors
the lobby is buzzing with activity
lines form in front of all the windows
depositors crowd around the writing tables
there are not
enough pens to go around
frantic hands reach over shoulders for withdrawal blanks
camera moves forward
over the shot is heard the seething blend of many voices
camera stops on a teller and a man
closing your account
im closing my account
i wouldnt leave a nickel in this bank
camera stops on a nd man talking to a woman
its getting so a mans money aint safe unless its in his sock

he hurriedly exits scene
inspector is still holding his ground
matt sits dejectedly in the same place as before
to dickson all i know is the banks been robbed and a murders been committed

he looks off toward door
sampson stands there looking off toward the group

but this is important mr
looks like theres a run on the bank
dickson and the others
dickson looks off at sampson unbelievingly what
a run on the bank
camera pans with him as he rushes over to the door to sampson
the lobbys half filled now
what are you talking about
dickson goes out the door followed by sampson
as sampson and dickson come into the scene
pointing in front of him look
dickson looks in the direction in which sampson points
from dicksons angle
this shot takes in the length of the bank
clerks bookkeepers stenographers in the f
the lobby in the b
it seems a little more crowded than in previous shot
sampson and dickson
dicksons face clouds
theyve been coming in steady all morning
i have called for some extra police
his eyes glued on the crowd all right

he turns to sampson
flaring up the banks reputation wouldnt be worth a nickel after that

theyve heard about the robbery and got panic stricken
listen get ahold of our available securities and have them turned into cash
wait a minute

as sampson leaves
dickson starts out in the direction of sampsons office
he is stopped by his name being called mr

he turns to follow then is stopped by another voice
we got a check on browns alibi

dickson is by matts side
the inspector is also in scene
dickson puts a hand on matts shoulder
now dont worry son

camera pans to the door as it opens and a detective enters beckons to the inspector off scene
as the inspector crosses to the new arrival who whispers something in his ear
the others in the room watch them interested
the inspector whispers instructions to the detective who leaves
the inspector then crosses slowly to matt
as the inspector comes up to the group around matt
carelessly so you were home last night
averting his gaze yes
what time did you get in
haltingly well about uh eleven oclock
eleven oclock eh

the inspector turns away and camera pans with the inspector as he crosses quickly to the door and beckons to the detective outside
all right kelley
kelley returns to the room accompanied by a little old irish woman
she looks around the room nervously
inspector leads her toward matt
as everyone stares at her curiously
indicating matt do you know this young man mrs

he has the best room in me house
the one with the fancy wallpaper
he feels himself cornered
the inspectors voice comes over the shot

she comes toward him threateningly

inspector leads her to the door
on the way mrs
halligan continues to mumble her protest against matts insult
for two nickels id knock his block off

she exits out of room
as dickson steps closer to matt
heartsick is that true matt
inspector comes up to them now
of course its true and he knows it
tenderly listen matt
if you dont tell the truth i cant help you
where were you last night
after a pause aw she was right

dickson is deeply disappointed
quickly appealingly but i wasnt here mr

the inspector barks at matt then where were you
favoring dickson as he leans closer to matt
to inspector wait a minute

matt looks at him
dickson is the only person he cannot tell his secret to

it cant be as important as this
now come on tell me
where were you last night
a note of desperation come on dont be a fool
matt you trust me dont you
no reply from matt
dickson is heartsick
he turns helplessly away from matt and walks out of sampsons office
of gert the telephone operator
all excited into phone what a day mame
everybodys coming in and drawing their money out
innocently gee mame i wonder what started it
shouting from the offices
the lobby is now packed to the doors with frantic depositors
the low grumbling of before is now replaced by
vociferous condemnation of the bank and dickson
individual protestations are heard above the din of the crowd
dickson enters scene and camera trucks ahead of him as he quickly passes several tellers giving them instructions to pay the depositors without delay
sampson catches up with him
look at them mr
theyre going crazy
did you get the case for the securities
but soon as our money runs out theyll mob the place
dickson looks off toward the crowd
if they only knew it theyre making things worse for themselves
somebody starts a silly rumor and they lose their heads
whatll we do
ill talk to them
listen go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible
tell em not to pay any attention to what i said
tell em to verify every signature
he leaves the scene as we taking in a greater portion of the lobby
dickson comes into the scene in the b
and stands on the stairs looking down at the crowd
he suddenly holds up his hand and shouts take your time folks
dont get excited
everybody stay in line
youll all be taken care of
dont worry about anything
plenty of time for everything
he has to raise his voice even louder
now listen everybody
listen to me
gradually their attention is attracted to him
all eyes are turned in his direction
shooting toward dickson past the crowd
dickson standing on the stairs
the people looking up at him
i want you to know that your money is safe
this bank is in excellent condition
if youve heard any reports to the contrary its based on malicious rumors
its a lotta hooey
we want our money
youll get your money every penny
we want it now
we dont want no speeches
as he addresses the crowd listen to me now
it takes time
ive got seven paying tellers working just as fast as they can
if youll all calm down im making arrangements to keep the doors open until four oclock this afternoon and you can be paid today
as they cheer their approval and return to their buddies
as dickson starts back toward the offices sampson comes to meet him
we cant keep open till four oclock
we havent cash enough to last an hour
dont you think i know it
they both start walking toward dicksons office camera trucking with them
as they pass the conference room schultz comes out and stops dickson
were still waiting for you dickson
dickson looks up studies schultz a moment as if trying to make up his mind whether to consult the board of directors or not
the door opens and dickson enters followed by schultz
they all look up
dickson goes up to them
well gentlemen weve got about one more hour to go
you know what that means
dickson and the directors
continuing well be forced to shut the doors
ive worked twenty five years night and day to keep this bank alive
youve all made money out of it
are you willing to help
defiantly what do you mean help
i know that among you you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city
get that money over here and ill stop this run within five minutes
that sounds very simple dickson but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes
i have everything i own in it
its your bank as well as mine isnt it
clark and schultz
this is just what hes been waiting for oh is it
judging from the way youve ignored us you wouldnt think so
we tried to reason with you but you wouldnt listen to us
shooting toward dickson
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you
you thought they were your friends
why dont you go out there now and try and get some help from them
aw theyve gone crazy
you cant reason with a mob
you cant reason with anyone else when youre in a jam
we pleaded with you to keep liquid but you wouldnt listen to us
you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish
now you want our help
you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that youve
theres one way you can get it
give us an option on your stock and resign as president
quietly tense so thats it eh
youve waited a long time for this chance havent you
his voice rising well im not going to resign now or ever
taking in the others at the table
you have no choice
ill shut the bank first
terrified say you cant do that i cant
you just wait and see
if that run doesnt stop within the next hour ill shut the doors
you know what that means
the bank examiner will step in tomorrow
youll be forced to liquidate
ill insist upon it
the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar
whats left you gentlemen can have
but ill guarantee there wont be enough to pay your next months garage bill
with which ultimatum he crosses to the door and exits camera panning with as dickson barges out
he stops in front of the door and looks off toward lobby
pandemonium has broken loose
men and women are hysterical
the police battle with recalcitrant depositors in a desperate effort to maintain order
strong men push weak ones out of the lines
wild eyed women jostle and scramble to get near the paying tellers
sex and priority rights are totally disregarded
above it all the din is deafening
men and women are clamoring for their lifes savings ready to commit murder to retrieve their little stakes
his face clouds
as he stands there watching the chaos slowly the deep concern vanishes from his face and his jaw sets in grim determination
he starts toward the stairs
cyril cluett enters from outside looking guiltily around
then he starts forward and exits from scene
the moment he is gone detective who followed him out appears in the doorway and crosses in the direction taken by cluett
dickson and sampson
get all the big bills in the place
take them out and get them changed
get nothing but ones and fives
distribute them among the tellers
tell them to take their time
stall as much as possible
count and recount the money
i hate to do this but ive got to have time to dig up some help
i think i know where i can get some real cash
snap into it sampson
we will lick this thing yet
he starts out of scene towards his office
camera trucks after him as he crosses past helen talking without breaking stride
come on in here helen
bring your book
i want some numbers to try to get some action
get parker at the union leeds the exchange
winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage
snap into it helen
just as quick as you can
pandemonium din and increasingly hysterical pushing crowds
the directors apparently are having a battle of their own
look at that mob
theyre going crazy
you know this run isnt doing the reputation of this bank any good
my dear friends
interrupting how much longer is dickson going to hold out
you know dickson as well as we do
hell shut the doors before he gives up control
all right let him
im sick and tired of hearing about him
if he wants to run the bank let him do it
i dont want any part of it
my dear friends oh shut up
sampson frantically advising tellers
one teller faces an angry depositor
er is this your signature
certainly its my signature
youve seen it often enough
im sorry but ill have to verify it
seated at his desk talking into the phone hello parker
listen ive got to have a million dollars in cash and ive got to have it quick
pause no no no
tomorrow is no good
i need it now
pause of course its safe
why the banks in excellent condition
you know that
the inspector is making preparations to take matt down to headquarters
youd better tell mr
dickson were taking matt brown downtown
to nd detective is the chiefs car outside
come on son
the detective takes matts arm and makes him get up from the chair
helen rushes into the room and into matts arms
helen clings to matt
sobbing oh matt
consoling her dont cry honey
everythings gonna be all right
the detective touches her shoulder tenderly
helen does not move
she clings to matt sobbing violently
as detective enters the room
camera pans with him as he crosses to the inspector
what did you find out mike
ive been trailing the cashier like you told me
youre right about that guy chief
theres something screwy somewhere
never mind all that
what did you find out
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlays joint
helen slowly lifts her head from matts shoulder
her eyes widen as she hears the name of dude finlay
mikes voice comes over this shot
he stayed about half an hour and then he came right back here
hes in his office now
slowly dawning realization thats where i must have seen that guy helen starts out of scene
as helen leaves matts side and crosses to the inspector and mike
did you say dude finlay
he was in the bank yesterday
suddenly alert he was here
he came to see mr
are you sure
as he listens intently to helen and the inspector
who was with him
two other men
they all went into mr
cluetts private office
pleased now were beginning to get somewhere
taking in all the people in the room
the inspector turns to the detective and speaks quickly kelly

he crosses to the door followed by tim and mike
as the inspector turns back and calls oh kelly call me up in cluetts office in about five minutes

pause yeah sure the board of directors turned me down but you know why

he slams the phone down angrily
cluett sits at his desk
the inspector stands in front of him
very suave i hope you dont mind me asking you a few questions mr
of course yes
just what would you like to know inspector
where were you at twelve oclock last night
much relieved thats very simple
i was home
shooting toward cluett
that is simple isnt it
i assume you can prove that if necessary
feeling very sure of himself oh yes of course
there was someone with me
smiling affably looks like youre going to have no trouble at all
what was the ladys name mr
if you dont mind inspector id rather not say that is unless it becomes absolutely essential
you see shes married
a big understanding grimace oh
smiling you understand
assuringly why of course
the telephone rings at this point
cluett turns to answer it
he picks up the receiver
the inspector watches him closely
as cluett answers the phone
yes hes here
to inspector its for you inspector
cluett gets up out of his chair to permit inspector to get to the phone
trying to be light somebody must be in good humor
he was humming mother machree
laughing its one of the boys from headquarters
he always sings mother machree whenever hes got good news
looks like this casell be settled in no time
his face clouds at this
he listens while inspectors voice comes over scene yeah kelly
where do you got him
inspector pauses waiting for a reply
detective kelly speaking on the phone into phone i aint got nobody here
im with brown
didnt you tell me to call you up in five minutes
cluett is terrified
the inspectors voice continues take him right down to headquarters
cluett starts to edge out of scene
the inspector is still holding receiver to his ear
cluett has edged close to the door his expression one of desperation
the inspector watches cluett out of the corner of his eye as he continues
into phone yeah
you dont mean cyril cluett the cashier
long drawn out yeah h h h h
did dude finlay tell you that
into phone what
sure i got him here
you know for a minute i didnt catch on
on the inspector
into the phone yeah
we got him here right now
okay kelly good work
looks like he feels himself trapped
he glances around the room quickly to determine his chances to escape
he keeps edging closer to the door with his back to it
his hands sneaks down and grabs hold of the doorknob
suddenly cluett snaps open the door and like a flash is out of the room
as cluetts figure disappears
the detectives are startled by the sudden move
hanging up receiver get him
the detectives dash out inspector following
cluett hurries through
at the door of the mens locker room
cluett comes into scene and enters locker room
inspector and detectives enter
look around quickly
looking off and spotting cluett there he goes
they rush out of scene their hands on their guns concealed
metal lockers line the entire room
cluett comes to door on other side of the room
just as he gets there he hears the detectives entering off scene
quickly he changes his mind and springs into a space between a row of lockers and the wall at the same time drawing his gun
inspector and detectives enter
the inspector and one of the detectives advance into the room cautiously holding their guns in front of them
kelley the other detective shrewdly separates from them
he must be here
theres only one door
cluett slips into a locker and closes the door behind him
they hear the noise off scene
what was that noise
sounded like a locker
a locker eh
well search every one of them
he must be in one of em
they search the lockers one by one until the inspector happens upon the one with cluett inside
he leaps out gun drawn
from inspectors angle
stand back inspector or ill shoot
drop that gun
calming tone all right jack all right
the detective and inspector
the detective drops his gun but the inspector keeps his levelled toward cluett off scene dont be a fool cluett
this is only going to make it worse for you
stand back inspector
let me out of here or ill shoot you
he starts slowly forward
the inspector ignores the warning
he takes a few more steps forward
from inspectors angle
i warn you inspector ill shoot
he levels his gun
he lifts his gun and aims for cluett off scene
he is frightened but desperate
he has his finger on the trigger ready to fire
nervously if you take another step ill a shot is heard
the gun drops out of cluetts hand
his arm goes limp
his face screws up in pain
rushing forward to grab him to the detectives let me see it
let me see it
its only his finger
get me a towel
to cluett now take it easy buddy
take it easy
all we want to do is talk to you
shooting over the tellers shoulder
people standing in line an atmosphere of pandemonium and hysteria
still at phone
his coat is now off and flung across the desk
his face is worn
perspiration rolls down his face
his appearance indicates he has been on the phone a long time
into phone defeated you cant do a thing
youre up to your neck
he is being turned down
he hangs up receiver
over his face slowly comes a look of deep perturbation
he refers to a small notebook open on his desk
his finger runs down the list of names as he searches for another prospect
camera pans across as inspector and other detectives with cluett in custody enter dicksons office all excited
you were right mr
brown didnt have anything to do with it
heres your man
why you must be crazy
ive known this man for years
hes just confessed
hes been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town
camera pans back to dickson as he stares unbelievingly at the shrunken figure of cluett who is trembling with fear
favoring cluett and dickson
cluett in heavens name what got into you
his voice shaking i dont know
its all been like a crazy nightmare mr
youre not a thief
howd you get mixed up with these kind of people
gambling i owed them a lot of money
last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars
shocked fifty thousand dollars
hysterically but i didnt kill that man last night
honest i didnt mr
as he continues dully yesterday they came to collect it
i begged them to wait
i wanted time to think but they wouldnt listen to me
his voice rises they threatened to kill me if i didnt pay it
i was desperate
i didnt know what to do
as he reacts to cluetts confession
cluetts voice continues over this shot
hoarsely quickly then they suggested that i help them rob the bank
all i had to do was turn off the alarm and
fix the time clock
it all sounded so easy
it seemed like a way out
as cluett continues wildly i didnt know anybody was going to be killed
the inspector addresses cluett what were you doing at finlays this morning
they took my keys yesterday
i went there to get them back
desperately if you were in a jam why didnt you come to me
i would have helped you out
you know that
i was crazy i tell you mr
i didnt know what i was doing
i wandered around in a daze
all i could think of was that they were going to kill me
pleading desperately youll stand by me wont you mr
you wont go back on me now will you
ill die if they send me to prison
practical dont forget theres a dead watchman downstairs
wild eyed i didnt kill him
i had nothing to do with that i tell you
i was home in my apartment last night i can prove it
skeptically claims he was there with a married woman
doesnt want to mention her name
desperately to dickson he wont believe it mr
but its the truth honest it is
i was in my apartment last night ask your wife she he stops dead
suddenly he realizes what he is saying
as he reacts electrically to the mention of his wife
he slaps a hand over his mouth as if to crush out anything further he might say
he stares wide eyed and frightened at dickson
dickson glares at cluett penetratingly
his brain slowly absorbs the revelation that phyllis was in cluetts apartment the night before
dully my wife
whats she got to do with you
out of the side of his mouth to a detective standing next to him no wonder he didnt want to mention her name
dickson comes over to cluett grabs him by the arm
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night
hysterically nothing nothing mr
dont pay any attention to me
i dont know what im saying
you just mentioned her name
what was she doing there
what was she doing in your apartment
she just came up for a drink
just for a few minutes
dickson grabs cluett and shakes him
a shriek youre lying
dont worry mr
well find out whether hes telling the truth
ill have a man from headquarters check up on it right away
hard you dont want to check up on anybody
ill do all the checking up
wait a minute
camera pans with him as he crosses to his desk and calls helen on the intercom
dickson on the phone
there is an awkward pause while dickson waits
he is obviously agitated
then the phone rings
answering it listen dear
i want to ask you something
i know its a silly thing for me to ask you but
i want you to tell me the truth
where were you last night
into phone disconcerted last night
er why uh last night very sombre listen dear
now tell me the truth about this
were you in cluetts apartment
into phone in cluetts apartment
well dear you see i
favoring dickson but showing cluett and the others
dickson slowly puts the phone receiver down
his face is ashen
he is shaken to the core
miserably she wasnt to blame mr
it wasnt her fault
honest it wasnt
i begged her to come up
she didnt an explosion get out get out
the detectives get on either side of cluett and silently they march him out of the room
inspector and others follow leaving dickson alone
when they have gone out
left alone he is a tragic figure
an incessant parade of disturbing thoughts tumble over each other in a hectic march across his chaotic mind
he grips his throbbing temples in an effort to crush out the torturous thought that phyllis was involved in an intrigue with cyril cluett
most of the directors seem to be weakening
obrien is remaining staunch to dickson
clark alone holds out
clark youre insane to hold out any longer
now lets get some money over here and stop this run
if we close our doors our stock wont be worth a nickel
meek little ives once more tries to speak my dear friends i interrupting ill lay you ten to one dickson wont give in
featuring schultz and clark standing together
maybe theyre right clark
weakening all right ill go and have a talk with him
as he starts to walk toward the door dickson sits at his desk his head cupped in his hands
clark enters thru door of outer office quietly
he looks at dickson a moment then crosses to the desk
shooting toward dickson
dickson slowly looks up at clark
softly dickson id like to talk to you about the bank
heartsick the bank
do anything you want with it
his face lights up
this is a turn he never expected
he really came in to capitulate
smoothly now youre talking sense
alert well draw up the option on your stock say eighty dollars a share
he is not even interested speaks vaguely eighty dollars
thats fine anything you say
he waves clark away
ill draw it up at once
as clark starts out of dicksons office elated helen comes in
you want the rest of those numbers mr
no never mind
she stares at him surprised backs out of the room
immediately following whats he doing honey
is he getting any help
he isnt trying anymore
they must have turned him down
he called some of the biggest people in town
sure theyd turn him down
he ought to know that
im going in there and talk to him
as he enters dicksons office
camera pans across as matt enters we havent got much time left mr
weve got to do something quick or itll be too late
softly why wouldnt you tell me where you were last night
ignoring the question youre not giving up are you mr
were you in cluetts apartment
dismissively oh i can explain about that later
youre losing your bank dont you realize what that means
gravely was mrs
dickson dont let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down
youve got more friends than anybody in this town
little guys guys who wouldnt be in business if it werent for you
all youve got to do is undeterred wait a minute
answer my question
fumbling for words well
dickson she was wasnt she
how long has this been going on
do you know
aw i dont know what youre talking about
all i know is that youre losing your bank and firmly all right
poignantly please matt
head bowed matt exits scene
immediately following did you talk to him
he has a sudden inspiration i got an idea
come on lets get to a telephone
they exit scene hurriedly
all of his beliefs are shaken by this seeming betrayal
dickson takes a framed photograph of phyllis from his desk gingerly sets it face down in the center drawer of his desk
also in the desk drawer is he cannot help but notice a gun
as he dictates to someone off screen a thirty day option on ten thousand shares of stock of this company now registered in the name of thomas a
now make that in triplicate and get it to me just as fast as you can
shooting past cashier in f
towards line of laborers waiting to be paid
cashier stands in front of a tall counter upon which is a small metal box filled with currency
he is speaking into the phone by his side as scene opens
he hangs up receiver and turns to the men on the other side of the window
speaking thru small window sorry ladies and gentlemen theres no more money
youll have to go on to the next window
he snaps the window shut slams down cover of little metal box
angry ad lib from line of laborers waiting to be paid
what do you mean theres no more money
panicked shouting and pushing
in the center of the crowd a woman faints
another cashier another window another angry line of depositors
thats all there is
more pushing shouting angry ad lib
phyllis dickson serious faced comes up steps and thru ante room on the way to dicksons private office
she pounds on door of office
there is no reply from within
standing next to her is a bank guard uncertain about what to do
throughout scene there are b
sounds of melee in the bank
to bank guard are you sure hes in there
he must be in there
he hasnt come out
she pounds on the door again
to guard ive got to get in there
cant you find me a key
reaching into helens desk yes i think theres one right here in the drawer
dickson rushes in
dickson is standing by a window
she walks over to him camera panning with her and stands in back of him
softly seriously tom
oh tom darling i came to explain about last night
dickson remains silent
cyril cluett doesnt mean anything to me tom
i went out with him last night simply because
well i had begun to feel that i didnt have any part in your life
that i was an outsider
tom all we did was to go to the theatre and then we went back to his apartment afterward for a drink
thats all it was
i didnt do anything wrong tom
i couldnt do anything wrong
i love you too much
you know that
as he stares dully out the window
dicksons voice coming over shot breaking down sobbing oh tom
they are furiously working two phones going down a list of people who owe dickson and the bank a favor
although matt has focus in the scene helens voice is always in b
as she handles calls making the same pitch
into phone rat a tat dicksons in a jam i tell you
the runs getting worse
continuing the big guys have got the screws on him
youve got to come through for him mr
he came through for you a hundred times
if his friends dont help him who is going to help him
looking up from her own phone pitch matt look
as a man elbows his way thru the crowd to a receiving tellers window
he is accompanied by a bank guard who sweeps the disbelieving crowd aside
he speaks loudly for everyones benefit any bank that tom dickson has anything to do with is all right
im putting my money in here
why should you be afraid
give him a chance
tom dickson is all right
hes perfectly square
im putting my money in this bank
i know what im doing
he reaches a tellers window which is closed
he pounds on it
i want to put some money in here
i dont want to take any out
a tellers face appears somewhat astonished
recovering composure certainly mr
into the phone rat a tat theyre starting to come in already
dont waste any time
get all the money you can lay your hands on and bring it down here right away
step on it
he hangs up dials another
helen has dialed another prospect also and hands the phone to matt
to helen whos this
into one phone mr
into the other phone mr
to helen ill talk to both of them at once
holding both phones up to his mouth listen both you fellows
dicksons in a jam
the runs getting worse
those big guys got the screws on him
yeah both you fellows got to come thru for him
listen if his friends dont help him who is going to help him
now he came through for you a hundred times
theyre starting to come in already
both of you fellas get all the money you can lay your hands on and bring it down here right away
both of you step on it
as several more people elbow their way thru the crowd on their way to tellers windows speaking aloud
loudly get out of my way
i got money i want to put into the bank
camera pans with him and second man until they reach the receiving tellers window where they fall into a line already containing ten or twelve people
the second man shoves his way to the front and addresses the teller
i want to make a deposit
four thousand six hundred dollars
hes the best man in the world
i believe in him
dickson and phyllis dickson
she is still explaining to him
it doesnt matter what you think about me theres something far more important
those people down there
the bank tom
you cant give that up
she is interrupted by sound of door opening
they look off
as sampson steps in
he looks off toward dickson
come here a minute
look at this
something wonderful has happened
people are bringing deposits
you wont believe it until you see it
you have to come out
dickson and mrs
he shambles over towards the door
as sampson and dickson come out from private office
pointing off look
dickson gazes in the direction he points
from dicksons angle
the line has grown in size
those trying to deposit their money are just as excited as those who want to draw it out
shouting tom dickson is a friend of mine
ill put money in his bank any time
shouting anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy
im going to put a lot of money in
here it is
i havent got much but here it is
tom dickson can have all my money any time
on dickson looking toward receiving tellers window
he stares at the miraculous spectacle deeply moved
he can scarcely believe his own eyes
a smile grows on his face
the sight of his friends coming to his rescue has an electrical effect on dickson
it revives his fighting spirit
he sticks his jaw out determinedly
without a word he turns and crosses to door of conference room
dickson flings the door open
clark and the other directors are startled out of their business
clark holds the necessary transfer papers in his hand
come out here you pawnbrokers take a look at this
weve been waiting fifteen minutes waving papers away you know what you can do with that
come on take a look at this
youll see a demonstration of faith thats worth more than all the collateral in the world
while he has been speaking several of the directors have edged over to the door
they are perceptibly impressed
he has remained unmoved staring at dickson as if trying to determine what kind of ruse is this
come on boys
come on clark
itll do your heart good
camera pans with clark as he crosses slowly to the door and looks out
look at that
theyre shoving their hard earned money across the counter with a ten to one chance against them
as they edge out onto balcony overlooking scene
if you fellas want to save this bank get some real money over here right away
decisively thats enough for me dickson
im ashamed of myself
ill have a hundred thousand dollars over here in five minutes
obrien starts away and crosses to a phone
dickson turns to the others
now youre talking
he goes off
only a moments hesitation this is your bank dickson and im with you
at last he can say something
shaky voice my dear friends thats what ive been trying to say all afternoon
go ahead and say it
turning to clark clark you can do twice as much as any of them
how about you
oh i dont agree with you but if everybodys gone crazy ill go crazy too
as clark and the other directors make their urgent phone calls
into phone this is ben schultz talking

into phone send all your available cash to union national
into phone currency small denominations into phone in tens and twenties
into phone say i want one hundred and fifty thousand dollars over here right away
listens i am in my right mind
no no no
not one hundred and fifty dollars
say listen you guys one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
a string of armored cars speed toward camera accompanied by an escort of eight motorcycle cops
the procession heralds its approach by the piercing wail of sirens
a dozen policemen precede the entrance of a parade of uniformed guards who carry in one hand sacks of money their other hands clasped firmly on their guns
the crowd in the lobby stands aside awe stricken
heads up make way there hey you look out
murmurs of approval are heard from the crowd
as the crowd is leaving the bank
everyone is smiling and happy
to nearby man thats the trouble with people nowadays
they hear a crazy rumor and right away they lose their heads
you didnt see me drawing my money out did you
as she works the switchboard the next day
union national bank
just a minute
as they gather for their morning ritual waiting for matt
nine oclock and all is lousy
ten to one hell have a crack about the run yesterday
its a cinch bet
i wouldnt take it
if he pulls a gag about the run well murder the guy
they hear matt approaching and gesture silence
matt strides purposefully in
he works the mechanism on the vault
there is a long silence during which nobody says anything most surprisingly of all not even matt
finally after having opened the lock turning to the group of expectant tellers well i suppose you guys had a good run for your money yesterday
they tackle him to the ground
as dickson enters and playfully pushes the hat down over gardiner the old bank guards face
the bank guard adjusts his hat annoyed then sees it is the president of the bank
merrily good morning mr
my wife is much better this morning
well thats too bad
mines all right too
guard puzzles over his non sequitur for a moment then smiles
camera trucks ahead of dickson as he strides through the lobby passing various individuals from opening scenes
he spots the teller with a habit of smoking on the job
the teller from dicksons angle holds up his empty hands
then he opens his mouth and chews elaborately showing that he has switched to gum
hellos and good mornings greet dickson as he continues on his way
he passes the janitor in a new uniform and stops him
well well well got your uniform eh
how much did it cost
proudly i dont know
sampson bought it for me
dickson opens his jacket affects an unenthusiastic perusal of his own well worn suit of clothing
cheerfully oh oh
i guess ill have to see sampson myself
camera follows him as he approaches helens desk outside his own private office
helen looks up
good morning helen
say i know whats the matter with you
matt hearing his name dashes up to stand next to dickson
i want you both to take the day off
go downtown and get a license and get married right away
weakly but i havent
i dont want to hear any more about it
if you dont get married ill fire both of you
by now they are beaming
dickson starts off then has a second thought
helen while youre downtown you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week
gee thanks mr
cutting him off oh no
its not for you
youre only going to get married
dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon
with just the barest suggestion of a wink he exits
matt looks at helen come on slave
they exit arm in arm
