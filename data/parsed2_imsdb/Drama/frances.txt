we hear the soft voice of frances farmer
no one ever came up to me and said youre a fool
there isnt such a thing as god
somebodys been stuffing you
on an expanse of water calm and undisturbed
after a moment it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface
a girls face breaks through
it wasnt a murder
i think god just died of old age
and when i realized he wasnt any more it didnt shock me
it seemed natural and right
the girl frances is blond very pretty she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of gods existence
she swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes
then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on west point beach
and yet i began to wonder what the minister meant when he said god the father sees even the smallest sparrow fall
he watches over all his children
that jumbled it all up for me
the banks of puget sound dotted with elm trees
frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary
towel around her neck her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun
but still sometimes i found that god was useful to remember especially when i lost things that were important
please god let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings
frances is now reading aloud from her diary gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair
an older woman lillian farmer sits opposite on the couch listening and nodding from time to time
a small suitcase stands by the front door
it usually worked
god became a superfather that couldnt spank me
but if i wanted a thing badly enough he arranged it
ernest farmer appears in the doorway and hesitates listening to his daughter read
but if god loved all of his children equally why did he bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always
ernest goes to frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head
she looks at him briefly smiling slightly
see you next weekend dad
he goes to the door and picks up his suitcase glances at lillian
she doesnt look up
i began to see that he didnt have much to do about hats or people dying or anything
they happened whether he wanted them to or not and he stayed in heaven and pretended not to notice
frances stands at a podium
other students and teachers sit to either side of her on folding chairs
above the proscenium is engraved west seattle high school
below that a banner hangs national high school essay competition
i wondered a little why god was such a useless thing
it seemed a waste of time to have him
after that he became less and less until he was
the audience consists of parents students and local dignitaries
we see several shocked faces
lillian is there also smiling
seated next to her is a distinguished looking woman alma styles
ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium looking a little worried
i felt rather proud that i had found the truth myself without help from anyone
it puzzled me that other people hadnt found out too
god was gone
we had reached past him
why couldnt they see it
it still puzzles me
frances closes her notebook and looks up waiting for some response
there is a deep shocked silence then a smattering of applause
lillian claps enthusiastically then rises to her feet
in the back a woman also stands
youre going straight to hell frances farmer
a stately man sitting next to her her husband judge benjamin hillier puts a restraining hand on her arm
the woman continues to glare at frances
frances stares back dumbfounded
the screen erupts into violence
a large unruly mob skirmishes with police in a cobblestoned square
on a truckbed addressing the crowd which carries placards reading organize now
workers of the world unite
and elect kaminski
stands martoni kaminski
by his side leading the crowds responses stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes harry york
and do you think its radical for a man to have a job and feed a family
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future and the future of your children
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country
because brothers thats you
the crowd cheers
harry york gives kaminski the thumbs up sign as a banner unfurls today seattle tomorrow the world
we realize weve been watching a newsreel
we see the school superintendent presenting frances with an award
seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying god
city hall steps
judge hillier and other bigwigs speaking heatedly to reporters
this prompts civic officials to charge that left wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the citys schools
miss frances farmer was unavailable for comment but her mother lillian lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small crowd of reporters photographers and curious neighbors
farmer a well known local dietician stepped to her daughters defense
emphatically frances has not turned her back on the lord theyre just having a momentary difference of opinion
what child hasnt questioned the lords mysteries in order to better understand them
to paraphrase mr
voltaire i may not agree with what she says but ill defend to the death her right to say it
freedom of speech unlike in the dark countries to the east still lives in america
and in my home
among the audience in the cinema we see frances and her father
frances slinks down in her seat until shes hidden from sight
frances carries library books and a small grocery bag
her hair and skin gleam in the sun
people in their yards stare at her as she passes
she walks on coming to a group of children slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall
a girl emma glances up
emma looks away quickly returns to her play
frances shakes her head as she walks on
frances hesitates then turns to look a man in his twenties whom we recognize as harry york kaminskis compatriot leaves a group of men in front of the union hall
and walks toward her
i wanna talk to you
frances keeps walking
harry hurries after her
momma told ya not to speak to strangers huh
reaches her grabs her arm hey
dont touch me
im not gonna hurt you
i just wanna talk
she stares at him
hes got a newspaper wedged under one arm
waiting okay then
youre causin trouble you know that
im causing trouble
youre a pain in the butt
you newshoundsve been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest
im just sixteen you know
who the hell cares what i think
but other people seem to
well if you didnt put it in the papers nobodyd even know about it
now wait a minute sweetie
do i look like a newshound to you
examining him no
actually you look more like a cop
hey if i was a cop id be packing right
holding coat open you see a gun
go on search me
pat me down
frances hesitates leans toward him as though about to frisk him
their eyes meet and she pulls away suddenly embarrassed
take your word for it
so who are you then
i work for martoni kaminski hes running for congress here
smiles points to him oh yeah
i saw you in the newsreel
embarrassed yeah well you know my dads done some work for kaminski
now youre catchin on
dont wanna get your daddy in hot water do you
see the papersve got us pegged as pinkos then you come along the friendly neighborhood atheist but im not
the newspapersre right again
youre no more an atheist than my mans a red but what theyre doin see theyre addin up their version of your ideas with their version of ours
could look bad for your daddy
could look bad for you and kaminski too i guess
sure dont talk like youre sixteen
well arent you the smoothie
now youre going to ask for my number i suppose
i suppose not
gotta ask you this though for all our sakes you better keep your trap shut
ill give it a try mr
hesitates nods harry
they half smile awkwardly as if neither really wants this encounter to end
then harry doffs his hat
she nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house
admiring her sure dont walk like sixteen neither
close on judge hillier in his robes identified by a nameplate on the bench
these are perilous times
with the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation and people turn to dangerous ideas i know
the camera pulls slowly back
we see that the courtroom is empty
those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant
whos behind this her mother
now we see who hes talking to alma styles the woman who sat with lillian at the school auditorium
as her attorney ive known her for years
what about the father hes a little pink
maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light shift some support to kaminski and those jackals
shaking her head hes no influence he doesnt even live at home
no i think frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended
it was her teacher who entered it in the competition
well the publicity must stop
its no good for seattle and no good for the country
sternly keep an eye on this will you alma
of course your honor
he nods with satisfaction
two right thinking people fighting for what they believe in
ernest farmer sits alone motionless at the table
between two candles facing him is frances check for a hundred dollars
we hear bustle from behind the kitchen door then lillian and frances enter juggling several hot dishes
they set down the dishes frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father
it always amazes me lil how you can whip up a hot hearty meal out of thin air
i can thank you for that
it was a hard earned talent
she moves the bread so ernest again faces the check
as lillian slices the bread father and daughter eat grimly
offering to ernest bread
taking a piece thank you
whens the last time you saw a hundred dollars ernest farmer
pushing back her plate im not hungry
you two just enjoy yourselves
after all this is a celebration
a long silence
they both glance slightly awkwardly at the check
frances takes it folds it and puts it in her pocket out of sight
im really proud of you frances
an essay contest
a national contest
thats pretty impressive
i didnt have much to do with it
you wrote it didnt you
yeah i suppose
dad whos harry york
well harry york is a guy who
well he does a lot of things
why do you ask
he talked to me today
told me to keep my mouth shut or id get everybody in trouble
harry york and i both work for mr
kaminski right now and
there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break
thats the way of things but mr
kaminski wants to change it and when it comes to new ideas the people in power get nervous
is kaminski a communist
no no no
all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation
hes a socialist then
sitting at a rolltop desk
shes looking through a large scrapbook
we see articles about nutrition and diet some featuring lillians picture others with her name in the heading
she listens to the conversation in the other room
the labels not important francie
whats important is this countrys got nine million unemployed and somethings gotta be done about it
besides left wing right wing up wing down wing
they dont mean much
all a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name
lillians face becomes set
she looks down at the book
an article titled girl denies god is there freshly pasted
she lays a hand on the blank page opposite
its already started dad
and i cant understand how it can hurt to be honest but the more i tried to explain what i meant lillian appears in the doorway
dont listen to him little sister
when youre proud of what you are you dont refuse the label understand
should be proud
you won that contest and made a name for yourself
she stomps out
frances and ernest push back their plates
lillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly
as ernest approaches she senses him and grows silent
she speaks without turning around
youre poisoning that childs mind
i have a right to talk to her
shes my daughter and shes beginning to understand why ive sacrificed so much in order to achieve
if youd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents they need help lil
they pay me back in other ways
what do they do for you kaminski and his friends
theyre all anarchists
sadly no lil
its just you cant understand their brand of patriotism
i cant understand a man who puts strangers over his family a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure
im going back to the hotel
see you next weekend
everything as usual mr
just give me my due
ernest starts back toward the house
he sees frances watching them and slows down turns
im more than willing to meet you halfway
dont make me sick
id sooner drown myself in puget sound
under his breath thats a thought lil
that sure is a thought
he trudges back toward the house under frances eye
a womans voice comes from behind the fence
are you all right dear
im fine perfectly fine
ernest stands on the porch holding his little bag
dad please dont leave early
just because of mama francie youll learn that sometimes its best to stay low and just walk away
he trudges out and down the walk
frances watches him shaking her head
that is not a lesson she wants to learn
harry is reading a playbill displayed in a theatre lobby spring production
university of washington players present uncle vanya by anton chekhov
frances is playing sonia
harry turns and enters the theatre
frances on stage seen from a distance
what can we do we must live
we shall live uncle vanya
frances is acting with a nervous young man chet
as her speech progresses the camera moves in nearer and nearer ending with a close up
it is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion
and then we shall rest we shall rest
we shall hear the angels we shall see the whole sky all diamonds we shall see how all earthly evil all our sufferings are drowned in the mercy that will
fill the whole world
and our life will grow peaceful tender sweet as a caress
wipes away tears poor dear uncle vanya you are crying
through her tears in your life you havent known what joy was but wait uncle vanya wait
we shall rest
embraces him we shall rest
audience bursts into applause
as the curtain opens and the players take their bows we see in the audience lillian and ernest lillian clapping madly crying nudging ernest to clap harder
and in the back stands harry york
to himself not bad farmer
not half bad
a celebration in progress
masks of comedy and tragedy hang on the walls
drama students lounge about eating drinking talking noisily
bing crosby is on the record player singing ive got the world on a string
the drama teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students
art is a constant struggle
some of you have the will but not the ability
for others the opposite
i dont wish to be harsh but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two
the front door opens
frances and chet enter
the young men rush over to congratulate her
frances takes a mock bow
she laughs as people cheer
two girls observe from the back
i could really learn to hate her
stand in line
things have quieted down
the drama teacher has cornered frances and is gesticulating drunkenly waving a copy of voice of action
frances is also tipsy but pays close attention to her mentor
this is the answer a subscription drive to voice of action
first prize is a trip to moscow
you could visit the art theatre maybe even meet stanislavski
but ill never win that
yes yes its all arranged
everyones collecting subscriptions in your name
and the best part is the trip returns you to new york
new york frances
this is your chance
you belong on the stage
flattered embarrassed thank you
a door opens quietly and harry slips in
he smiles at frances who disentangles herself from her teacher and rushes over
did you see the play
you think id miss it
whatd you think
shrugs i just wanted to see how you looked
howd i look
smiling dont be a rat harry
you looked okay
glances around joints pretty dead
how bout i take you home
she hesitates looks around and sees chet passed out snoring in a chair
she takes harrys arm
the beach is very dark but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old chevrolet parked near the shore
you really think so
frances and harry are sitting in the back seat
when you were up there you were really
there know what i mean
everyone else looked stupid
i dont know
yeah its a gift
you gotta do something with it
yeah but if i win this trip mamall kill me
she hates russians
i do want to go though
to new york especially
but i wanted to do it
youre not the quiet type frances
they are silent for a while
you know my old man was an inventor
spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads stuff like that
well i was supposed to be his partner
when i told him the smell of his workshop made me sick i thought he was going to die right there
what happened to him
he retired to florida
made a killing in vending machines
he grins ironically and frances laughs
i kick myself sometimes but the thing is i would have been miserable living his life
so you think i should go
try this acting thing
you can make good money at it
i dont know harry
i want so many
you dont know what you want
she looks at him smiles wistfully
not in the long run anyway
she starts to unbutton her blouse
harry is pleasantly surprised but unnerved
dont you think its up to me to
come on harry
this is america land of the free
whispers i thought we might go skinny dipping
harry cant believe his good fortune
lillians face distorted
no daughter of mine is going to communist russia
lillian is in her apron canning peaches
you act like im a bomb thrower mama
its just a trip
lillian follows her down the narrow almost institutional hallway
but theyre using you
oh ma theyre not using me
its just a chance to travel see things
besides its the only way i can get to new york
theyve reached frances room
she puts on her coat
ill pay your way to new york
ill work ill slave
ill sell my vegetables to the truck farmers or sighs oh mama dont you understand
she stares out the window
we see ernest mowing the lawn
i have to do this on my own
you see ive learned your lesson very well
to do what i think is right and everyone else be damned
frances turns and heads back down the hall
i never taught you that
frances keeps walking
little sister if you dont wise up soon its going to be out of my hands
theyve reached the kitchen
ernest is there sweating drinking water
it isnt in your hands mama
its my life
yes but important people are concerned about this
judge hillier spoke to alma styles i dont care
grimacing you will
she storms outside
frances sighs looks at her father
what do i do dad
you really want to go
and you think its worth all this
if i didnt i wouldnt put you through it
lillian has a few reporters drawn off to one side
alma styles and a minister stand nearby
a crowd has gathered
inside the station more reporters are milling around frances
almost conspiratorial the authorities tell me theres no legal way i can stop her but the way i see it its bigger than me or my family
the following is heard faintly as b
to the scene below american integrity thats whats at stake here
theyre sending my daughter to the heartland of darkness
the dark forces that would overthrow our country
ernest and the drama teacher stand at frances side
has your earlier denial of god led you to communism
im not a communist
but frances you said i said all countries are of cultural interest
besides russia has the greatest theatre company in the world
better than any american company
what do you think of stalin
ask me about stanislavski
suddenly frantic loud help me save my daughter
save the children of america
a tall spectral man dressed in black adds repent frances repent
their cries seem weird almost deranged and lillian is taken aback
passengers climb onto the bus
as frances is hugged by her drama teacher the tall spectral man approaches her
in his arms he carries a potted plant a bible and a flashlight
bless you sister bless you
dignified as though conducting some bizarre ceremony here is a bible for solace
and this plant to remind you of the eternal seed in all of us
and finally a flashlight to illuminate your path through darkest russia
frances accepts the gifts bewildered
the tall spectral man stares at her through hollow eyes
she staggers on toward the bus looking like a bedraggled statue of liberty
the tall spectral man sings an ethereal hymn
lillian blocks frances path
frances looks at her tearfully
i love you mama
turns to her father i love you dad
hugging her be careful francie
as frances climbs on board
frances im warning you
im gonna throw myself beneath the wheels
ill do it frances
inside the bus frances stares out the window and shakes her head sadly
the bus starts
everyone looks at lillian
she is motionless
frances sighs and the bus moves off unimpeded
there is a homicidal rage in lillians eyes as she stares after the vehicle
then the reporters rush toward her
what do you say now mrs
she looks down her lip quivering
as the reporters shout unanswered questions ernest puts his arm around his wife and leads her away
lillian is happily thumbing through her scrapbook
her hand runs down the page and we see a series of headlines with photos photo lillian frances then photo lillian next is a snapshot of frances on board on
then two snapshots of her in what is clearly moscow
she wears a russian hat
the kremlin stands behind her
then snapshots of her in new york with a small clipping from the new york times visits moscow art theatre
below this is a magazine advertisement showing frances in a glossy chesterfield ad
her hair is swept up off her head and she looks glamorous artificial very different from how weve seen her
lillian takes up the paste brush and liberally swabs the opposite blank page of her scrapbook
a handwritten letter from frances lies beside her
she removes a clipping from the letter and spreads it out
the clipping says stars of tomorrow and shows a semi circle of girls faces inside garish stars
lillian circles frances photo and sits back to admire it
we see the hollywood sign in the distance
then change focus to see the front of the studio
frances hair is tightly curled
she is dressed in a grotesquely ruffled white gown and seated on a small stool
behind her two assistants fuss with bunches of white carnations hanging on a grid
a seasoned publicist kneels nearby and a woman with a coffee cup claire surveys the scene
one more time
frances stares dramatically off into space
the camera clicks
oh i swim some
play the piano badly
and i read like a fiend i like history
no no people dont want that
now listen you spend lots of time at the beach
youre crazy about dancing
and youre the kind of girl whos just a little in love with love
now try again
writing in notepad beach
in love with love
ironically thats me
the camera clicks again
bebe a tall brooding well dressed man enters
good morning mr
frances farmer contract player six month option
an assessment okay
cant we show them off a little more
i guess so sir
nods stares again at frances very fine bone structure
claire stares after him with profound contempt
coming up to claire not much to work with
hows this reading the most interesting thing about frances farmer is that her road to hollywood was miles long
after winning a beauty contest the first prize of which was a trip to europe
she made some deal with the commies and went to moscow but im not going to say that am i
miss farmer returned to new york city and had a brief fling with the broadway stage before coming west to seek stardom
well actually she couldnt get hired but lucky for her some guy in our new york office saw her
she says soon as she gets a stake shes going back
claire rolls her eyes
shes heard this before
the camera clicks again
frances is frozen in time
two students are doing a scene from design for living
others sit around watching whispering flirting sleeping
but frances is paying very close attention making notes
the man next to her rubs her arm and whispers something
she grimaces and pays no attention
then she notices two rows in front a young handsome student dick whos also making notes
she stares at him for a second then back at the stage
a tiny rustic cottage dogs everywhere
two identical old fords are parked out front
frances sits on the couch talking on the phone
did you get the check
oh my god it opened
whatd you think
water lands on her face
she grimaces playfully
well i hope i get bigger parts they dont come much smaller
the last line is garbled as water streams in her mouth
she fumbles for something on the floor
no im fine
i just have water in my mouth
she finds a water pistol on the floor picks up the phone and starts searching for her assailant
no mama im not changing my name
they cant actually make you you know
most people dont realize that
playfully covering receiver oh dick
she flings open the bathroom door and finds him dick from drama class
a furious water battle ensues
no no nothings going on
fast i love you too mama
give my love to dad
she hangs up lowers her gun as dick squirts her
shes getting wet
her shirt clinging to her breasts
she likes it
on the small screen we see frances in the arms of a man in kurt
go with these trappers
theyll lead you safely down the mountain
but kurt i
no no arguments
be my good girl and go
theres a forest a burning forest and you know what i have to do
oh angela my own
on screen the corners of frances mouth begin to tremble but her eyes remain wide and innocent
the fire chief slowly inclines his head toward hers
the brim of his hat hits her forehead
frances covers her face with her hands and bursts out laughing
the fire chief looks stunned
she tries to control herself
looking into camera im sorry lets go back
laughter inside the screening room
a small light flicks on and from behind we dimly see two men
irate what the hell is that
whats she doing
thats talent andy
after a beat oh
frances smiles and eases shut the screening room door
we hear the laughing man inside shout lets see that again
frances puts a cigarette in her mouth and fishes for a match
a mans hand appears holding a lighter
she looks up its harry wearing a garish hawaiian shirt and a panama hat
harry god damn york
a real person
frances throws her arms around him
they hug warmly
how ya doin farmer
look at you
whatre you doing in hollywood
came to get a tan
they compare forearms
but come on harry whats the real reason
staring out kaminski
yeah i read about that
terrible business suicide
since when do you believe the papers
they killed him kid
they killed him
they threw him out that window
she stares down two stories to the ground imagining jesus
also staring down yup
poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldnt die
too god damn much heart
he just didnt want to die
walking on but
but why harry
whyd they do it
shrugs he wouldnt play ball
what can i tell ya
brightening anyway i didnt want to be next so i skipped town came down here to work for some big wig
tail and nail job
confidentially im sort of a non gentlemans non gentleman
turns around displaying his shirt how dya like the camouflage
pushing him down the stairs cmon lets get out of here
harry and frances walking arm in arm
it was slow at first but im doing bits now
i always told ya frances
you got real ability
smiling i know what ability youre interested in
hey im a man arent i
whattaya say we have dinner then maybe head out to the beach rub some of this tan off each other
off her sober expression for old times sake
i met someone
stiffens slightly yeah
what is he muscleman
frances shakes her head
then its temporary
whispers all actors are phonies
hes joking but she doesnt respond
hey thats great farmer just great
she smiles wistfully seeing him cover up his disappointment
she squeezes his arm and they continue walking
lights being adjusted cameras set actors walking through their blocking
in the midst of this we see frances dressed in western attire making a point to the wardrobe mistress who is listening without enthusiasm
spreading her arms these creases
i look like i just came from the laundry
im supposed to be hiding out in boxcars sleeping on floors
cool this is the suit we fitted on you miss farmer
friendly oh i know that
but it could look more realistic dont you think
looking her over itll do
no one will notice
we hear a man conspicuously clearing his throat
both women turn as mr
bebe steps forward
bebe good morning
he nods imperceptibly
come along with me fanny
she hesitates then goes
im not the cookbook
leading her off you see weve got to change that name
frances and bebe come through the sound stage door into the light
he gestures to indicate what direction theyre going but remains silent watching her
shes uncomfortable blinking like a bird
i like your looks
you have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties
garbo dietrich thank you i intend to make a great deal of money off you
frances is taken aback
this is all rather blunt
since we have you on a seven year contract im planning long range
im going to loan you out to sam goldwyn to make a picture called come and get it
thats a very good book
itd make a terrific never mind that
im concerned about you
they hear a ruckus in the distance and turn and look picketers are fighting with police
it is raucous brutal
bebe turns back to her with a stern look society is falling apart miss farmer and people have to buckle down do their jobs
you see i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry and i cant have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs
head lights now can i
but im concerned with everything mr
fierce but very muted no im concerned with everything
but im the one up there on the screen
youre an actress miss farmer and your job is to act
shes about to reply but he quickly takes her hand and raises it to his lips
kisses it very formally like a suitor
then turns and walks into the sumptuous executive office building
she watches him go
brightly colored bulbs flashing causing the wisps of fog around them to glow
the bulbs spell a noisy crowd is gathered outside the theatre straining against velvet cordons
big black limos disgorge couples in formal evening wear to the applause of the crowd
all slightly small town off key
harry now sporting a mustache hat pulled down over his face stands across the street
puffing his cigarette not bad farmer
two limousines streaking through the night
frances sits next to a faceless studio executive
shes all dolled up
she looks uncomfortable
she glances up at the limo ahead of them
dick sits between lillian and ernest a reporter and photographer crouch in front of them
i guess its no secret that im proud
only twenty one years old and look at all shes done
confidentially as for her looks i flatter myself that she gets them from me
he winks at the reporters
and not only has frances come home a star shes also brought me this big handsome lug of a son in law
farmer what was your reaction when frances told you she had married
well i was pleased of course
uh dwayne is a real gentleman
dick smiles and hugs them both
well all i can say is i feel like ive known these two for years
girlishly oh dwayne
overcome this is like a fairy tale
theyre stopped at a light
outside their window we see derelicts casualties of the depression huddled in the night
shes staring at the derelicts
we feel her sympathy for them
almost like shed rather be out there
a man with hollow eyes shouts something at them
whatd he say
she rolls down her window
the studio executive beside her looks at her like shes crazy
to driver lets go
well be late
the limousine lurches forward
frances settles back in her seat letting the night air sweep over her face
the two limos pull up the second emptying first
as frances gets out the crowd cheers wildly
she walks past them eyes glazed
she doesnt see harry who is held back by cordons
lillian is posing and signing autographs
in her tight formal dress frances looks radiant but constricted
as she walks voices assault her there she is
how does it feel to be back in seattle frances
a little strange
isnt she gorgeous
hows the movie frances
smile little sister smile
frances sees her mother smiling nervously
they have entered the again there is a cordoned area in the center where seattle luminaries are sipping champagne
reporter lurches forward can you make some statement about seattle how the city helped you or the schools well the truth is the city had nothing to do with it
i was lucky
and what wasnt luck was hard work
judge hilliers wife whom we recognize as the woman who shouted at frances in the auditorium steps forward in a garish gown
shes holding a large key
miss farmer i cant tell you how proud i am to meet you
she embraces and kisses frances whos more than a little put off
after the kiss she takes firm hold of frances hand and wont let go
judge hillier steps to his wifes side
lillian also approaches
on behalf of the seattle ladies club as a token of our vast admiration excuse me
dont i know you
i dont believe so
you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay
no my dear
you must be mistaken
barely audible oh bullshit
i beg your pardon
to the dignitaries listen im still the same girl that wrote that essay the same girl who went to russia and you people arent proud to meet me at all
a hideous silence
judge hillier is fuming
his wife is aghast the key to the city extended awkwardly in front of her
she shoves it into frances arms
frances moves to leave but her arm is taken by the studio executive who escorts her into the theatre
the crowd follows
lillian is utterly mortified
we track along the side of the theatre
an exit door is thrown open and frances storms out
as she does she trips over an old indian beggar
she stops and looks at him
he peers up at her with large forlorn eyes
then holds out his hand
a connection is made
all the anger drains out of her
she gives him money several bills
he breaks into a wonderful crooked grin
she starts away hesitates then hands him the key to the city
he stares at it bewildered
she strides away toward her limousine which is now parked with several others at the end of the alley
the chauffeurs are talking and smoking a cigarette
her chauffeur sees her and hurries to his limo
as it pulls into the street we see harry drift back to the curb and stare after it
frances sits on the old wood jetty staring out at the water the lighthouse
its one thing to marry the guy but did you have to sleep with him
she cracks up
harry laughs at his mistake
i meant the other way around
still laughing well the studio told me not to
is that why you did it
who ever thought theyd be right for once
its a zoo back there youre telling me
and my mother
she acts like shes on mars or something well shes back to earth now
theyre all pretty huffed up about your leaving
i think you better go back kid
he looks at her thoughtfully then sits
you know the funny thing is its not a great movie
i mean it couldve been but they screwed it up gave it a happy ending
and all my friends i know theyre going to smile and say they loved it
if they say they love it theyll probably love it
not everybody lies you know
warmly to him no they dont do they
frances youre a movie star now
if you give them what they want you can get anything
i dont have what they want harry
stares at the water harry will you tell me something
how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving
some people starve kid
until we can do something about it they might as well see a movie
makes em feel better
but i dont want to be like that
i want to do something
important whatre you gonna do waste your talent
why not use it to make something worthwhile
you can do that you know
laughs yeah if i dont make too big an ass of myself
they start to walk now along the beach
we see harrys car and the chauffeured limousine parked above
tell you what
lets ditch the limo
let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy
the hell you will harry york
come on cinderella your pumpkin awaits
she shakes her head mischievously
moves backward unbuttoning her coat
like a clock striking bong
the coat falls
dont start farmer
dropping her scarf its midnight harry
my glittering raiments are dissolving
nervously the chauffeur
he deserves a show
he missed the movie
im serious frances
this is important
kicking off a shoe i know
she kicks off another shoe sailing it into the water
frances is zipping off her dress
harry bends to pick up the first shoe
a single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands
who was that girl anyway
harry watches her mesmerized
the dress is off
come and get it harry
she skips off down the beach her dress strewn on the sands
after a moment from the darkness we see her underclothes fly into view
harry can restrain himself no longer
excited hot damn
he drops the shoe and runs after her tearing off his clothes
after a moment from the darkness we hear her squeals of laughter
the street outside the studio main gate
actors directors etc
arrive in their shiny expensive autos
among them is frances in her old battered ford
she waves to the guard and drives through
as frances pulls into her parking space claire the woman from the photo session strolls up
hi frances got a minute
if you dont mind walking my way
they walk toward the dressing room
nervous well i suppose i should just say it
its your clothes
bewildered my clothes
yeah i mean slacks
and work clothes
and that awful car its a perfectly good car
really i hate to sound
its just that the public expects something different from its stars
people wont take you seriously
i dont care if my clothes are taken seriously
or my car
you know what i mean
you mean what if the public finds out i perspire
and wear slacks
and drive an old jalopy
what if they find out im a real person
say it aint so
not a real person
claire is laughing
they go inside
posh fit for a star
frances smiles at the makeup man
as frances sits at the table and eddie goes to work thats not all frances
bebe is very concerned about your politics
he hears youve been donating money speaking at rallies
please please tell mr
bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life wed make a lot better movies
im sorry frances
its my job you know
imitating bebe this is a factory and we each have our jobs
the writer writes the director directs and the actress
ill relay your message
dick is talking on the phone in the living room
yes of course shell make a statement on womens rights
call back tomorrow okay
he hangs up
immediately the phone rings again
he stares at it wearily then answers pointedly dwayne steeles residence
through the half open door to the bedroom we see frances dozing an open script laid out beside her
yes ill tell her
he hangs up
slowly enters the bedroom
frances looks up
you learn your lines
nods drowsily sort of
thereve been some calls
about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called whats her name
she said she was fired
too bad huh
she said she delivered your message and that youd understand
frances looks stricken
dick presses on
there was another call too
from your agent
he says your summer stock deal is all set
so youre going back east huh
you werent going to tell me were you
just pack up and leave is that it
dick we need some time apart hey im not a complete fool you know
i can see youre going sour on me and when i try to do something about it you turn your back and say its nothing
dick i cant even breathe here
im dwayne now
and you damn well better get used to it
softly remembering dick
i dont suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too that i might want to do theatre
no cause you dont want me along do you
and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock
its all about that night isnt it
bewildered what night
i never pressed you about it but god damn it youre gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were
quietly you want his name
dick is crumbling inside
we watch it sink in
building gradually to resentment and rage
he starts to throw a tantrum
hurling things around the room
frances just sits there
i think youre overplaying this a bit
he hurls a pillow against the wall and rushes out
frances looks after him then turns
shes now facing the bureau
a mirror sits on top of the bureau
she looks into it
doesnt like her expression
turns the mirror away
a playbill in a theatre lobby reads mt
kisco playhouse summer season the petrified forest
among the names listed is frances farmer the come and get it girl
suddenly we hear an eruption of applause
tight shot on two men harold clurman a thoughtful aristocratic man and clifford odets who is taller slimmer with black hair and intense dark eyes
around them we see mostly hear the audience going crazy leaping to its feet yelling bravo
clurman and odets sit impassively
as the hurrahs die down and the audience files out the two men sit there
finally clurman turns to odets
odets nods very slightly
frances sits in the cramped room listening intently to clurman
occasionally she sneaks a glance at odets who is pacing like some caged beast
the group is more than a theatre company
its the embodiment of an ideal
our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense a creative individual and an instrument of change
you see watching odets really mr
clurman you dont have to sell me
forgive my indulgence
seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy
the point is mr
odets here has written a wonderful play
most of the roles are cast but we havent found our female lead
who is she
shes a tramp from newark
forgive me but i think youd be perfect for the part
odets is pacing furiously seizing their attention
he stops looks at her then resumes
miss farmer for me this is not a play its an assault
a plea for understanding
i think we live in a time when new art works should shoot bullets
and you make very attractive ammunition
tentatively almost boyishly he smiles
she returns it
and whats the title of this seduc
mysterious intimate golden boy
it reads golden boy
crowds of people streaming out of the lobby
a sign over the box office reads tomorrows performances sold out
odets sits on the curb
behind him the lights in the theatre lobby flicker off
pedestrians stroll by an odd mix of affluent theatre crowd and s bums
frances emerges from the theatre sees him sitting there
sits beside him
you wanted to talk
he peers up the street
a girl selling pencils catches his eye
you see that girl
she looks like a waif tough vulnerable pleading with a wealthy couple following them down the street
a drama being played out in the distance out of earshot
thats who my play is about
frances watches the girl
thats me clifford
strong i know but im not seeing it
its there frances the fire is there but its not coming through
youre lazy the same conversation continuing im not
yes you win them you bring them into your heart touch them but you dont set them on fire
but i want to
i need an incendiary
then show me
thats what im here for to learn to grow
then its very simple
you have to stop being afraid frances
its in you
clurman is delivering a speech in the background as photographers snap pictures
behind them on the platform frances and odets continue their conversation in whispers i can see it
you just have to let it out
no one will quash you here but its still a fight a struggle
being true to your art being honest is always a struggle
we now hear clurmans speech
the initial words below were background to the above
what we hear now is underlined not only an artist but an instrument of change
we must look to the world around us not content to observe but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs
we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy
we contribute our profits for if fascism is not stopped in spain it will spread across europe jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive
presenting check to the artist to be vital must be a soldier too
im not afraid of struggle clifford
yes you are
we all are
the first step is to acknowledge our fear
the conversation continues
you dont want to show your whole soul ugly mis shapen and pitiful you dont want to show it angry god damn it clifford will you shut up
i tell you i want to give these things
i want to give them to the audience and i can give them i will give them so shut up
she is seething
he smiles watching her
give them that
as she feels the anger coursing through her body she realizes what hes talking about
she looks at him still breathing heavily
gradually her face turns toward a smile
he reaches out and with exquisite tenderness kisses her
they enter slightly drunk laughing
he takes her coat
shes looking at the apartment
he sees her
a dark thought flickers across his face and he breaks into an exaggerated act oh my god
frances im such a cad
i cant go through with this
my wife is in europe but this is her house
gesturing off her bedroom
i cant ask you to
playing along oh well
i guess i better leave then
she starts to put on her coat
he watches her
okay but come here first
leading her down hall come here
i want to show you something
he opens the bedroom door
the bed is drawn back and the sheets are sprinkled with rose petals
frances eyes are large
the kiss is very hungry now
bebes huge desk
variety headline actress fights fascism
next to the newspaper are a dozen pencils which bebe is lining up precisely parallel
his expression is totally obsessive crazed
behind him a woman tora is cutting his hair
a studio lawyer paces nearby
and on top of her political activities now shes got a lawyer
she wants out of her contract mr
she says shes through with motion pictures
muttering im sure it wasnt me it wasnt me
excuse me sir
i dont know who she fucked to get where she is but i dont think it was me
tora is massaging the back of bebes neck
you could always dump her mr
teach her a lesson
there are a million beautiful girls out there who dont give a damn about politics
thats not the point
frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you
no that young lady has a contract and shes going to honor it
i mean good
i think its time to take the gloves off
scowls speaks into intercom get me some reporters
afterthought particularly louella parsons
during this conversation bebe has been drawing on the variety
we now see his work
beneath the headline was a photo of frances on whom bebe has drawn a mustache
the marquee for golden boy reads held over
ushers are opening the glass doors from the empty lobby onto the street
we hear thunderous applause from the inside
frances emerges from the stage door to a throng of autograph seekers
she smiles tiredly but good naturedly complies
a little ways back stands a boyish young man holding a single red carnation
when the autograph seekers are satisfied and all but a few have trailed away the young man steps forward
ive never done this before
i had to tell ya youre great
he shyly hands her the flower
thank you very much
im glad you liked the play
she smiles and begins to walk away
the young man follows her
im really sad its closing
now what am i gonna do on tuesday nights
you can always come see it in london
only if you were in it
i wouldnt miss it
boy id love to
but im going to hollywood
smiling are you an actor
well okay im still in school
but as soon as i graduate
california here i come
after a pause are you really serious
then dont go to hollywood
im telling you straight if you have any serious ambitions stay clear of the place
itll crush you
you sound as if you hate it
no i dont hate it
again she walks on
arent you ever going back
not if i can help it
youll break a lot of hearts
after a pause what about your husband
frances stops walking her eyes shoot to the young mans face
will you be getting back together
when you quit hollywood i mean
what is this
the young man suddenly seems much older and there is no sign of the awkward boyishness
is it true youre getting a divorce
you little bastard
the young man grins
thanks for our chat miss farmer
be seeing you
he begins to walk away
just one minute
turning youre wasting your time lady
nothings off the record with me
he is gone
odets sits at a table in back drinking and writing in a notebook
frances comes up to him
he smiles draws her to him for a hug
howd it go
she hesitates still affected by the incident outside the theatre
but how do i know you love me
your big speech
how do i know its true
youll get to be the champ
theyll all want you all the girls
but i dont care
ive been undersea a long time
when theyd put their hands on me i used to say this isnt it
this isnt what i mean
its been a mysterious world for me
but joe i think youre it
i dont know why i think youre it
take me home with you
smiling i already have
she nods turns her back to him
hows it sound
you think i got it
you got it
yeah tonight i think i got it
she is crying
frances comes in the front door with a bag of groceries removes her key
walks into the living room stops short
clurman is sitting on the couch a bottle and two glasses in front of him
looking around wheres clifford
hes not here
she drinks hers watching him
i hear youre meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract
i dont want them breathing down my neck while were in london
well you see thats the point
you wont be opening in london
frances looks like shes been punched in the stomach
insecure you dont think im good enough
good lord no its just
we needed backing and
well we found it
a rich actress
thats the deal
she plays lorna
growing angry but
but wait a minute
were supposed to be different right
this theatre is supposed to be different
and this play
this play is all about what greed and money do to people
i know but over his line what does clifford say
right now we have to be practical
does clifford even know
off his silence you didnt tell him did you
standing im gonna tell him
where is he
he knows frances
she collapses back into her seat
her head is swirling
gently he approved it
shes glaring at him
he hands her a letter
im very sorry but
well hollywood wants you back right
her eyes fill with rage
she hurls her drink in his face
he stands and with as much dignity as he can muster leaves
frances is shaking
she rips open the letter he gave her
stares at it in horror
a few tables with phones men on the phones writing down numbers
behind them are blackboards with horses names and prices
off to one side harry is conferring with the owner
of course it can be done mr
jones but its how you do it
theres a way to pay off l
cops and a way to get yourself arrested
first you gotta know who to approach a man at one of the phones looks up calls
you harry york
harry nods startled
the man at the table holds up the phone and goes to his next call
harry takes the phone
frances on the phone
a half packed bag lies on the bed
a bottle and glass sit beside her
shes been crying and drinking
harry where are you
jesus frances howd you find me
i called your god damned office
i want you to kill him harry
youll do that for me wont you
i loved him i loved him
calm down frances
dont tell me what to do just give me his head on a platter
frances unfolds the crumpled letter clurman gave her
two fucking lines
my wife returns from europe tomorrow
i cant see you any more
just like that
sobbing harry i hate being in love
i dont ever want to be in love again
i just hate it
with the patter of the bookie taking bets beside him harry listens to frances sobs
i know frances
he hears a click on the other end
he hangs up and heaves a long slow sigh
frances in a pair of overalls falls face down into mud
we see the slate flowing gold scene a take
then the same action is repeated from a slightly different angle
next to her is an old car its wheels mired in mud
she falls again this time splattering mud all over her face and hair
she lies still for a moment gritting her teeth
sitting comfortably in a nearby directors chair is a director reading daily variety
the headline reads studio wins farmer war on hollywood
behind the director off to one side stands bebe
tugs on the directors sleeve how was that
looking up good good
one more time
standing for gods sake
because we want to get it perfect
just the right combination of fury and confusion
you can understand that cant you miss farmer
were serious artists here right
the director glances toward bebe who nods with satisfaction
frances watches this interaction
she hesitates then approaches bebe
she wipes some mud from her face and drops it at her feet
bebe you can hold me to my contract but you cant break me
im back and im gonna make the best of it
somewhat snidely id like nothing better
she turns and walks with an air of pride to her wardrobe trailer
cars line the driveway
we hear the sound of a large party
a car pulls up
bob barnes gets out goes around to open the door for frances
she doesnt move
this is a mistake
this is a disaster
come on its just what you need
let everyone see you
talk to them live it up
tiredly but weve been at it since six this morning
at least you couldve let me go home and change
look frances i didnt want this job
think im crazy
but you begged me improve your image
lemme try huh
getting out youre right
sighs okay lets go get em
taking pills from pocket here take a few of these
studio makes em in the basement
they keep the fat off
joking so not only am i a troublesome bitch but im fat too
they make you feel nice and peppy
she nods takes a few
they head for the door
the doorbell chimes
the hostess connie a pleasant looking woman answers the door
looks like a swell party
as they embrace frances looks around with trepidation whisper god whos here
also whispering the usual vermin im afraid
barnes tries to pull frances inside
she sees a flurry of waiting faces
everyones watching her
sotto voice get me a drink
barnes nods concerned and crosses to the bar
some people seem amused some curious some scornful
the director from the mud scene nods to her
connie is at her side for support
a voice from somewhere pierces the chatter so nice to have you back frances
as barnes returns with her drink she turns to connie connie can i use the upstairs bathroom
frances lies in a bubblebath relaxing sipping her drink
she obviously feels a lot better
a fat man enters stares at her
he is dumbfounded
he slowly retreats into the hall
barnes is talking to a young man whom we recognize as the reporter who tricked frances in new york
you wouldnt believe the offers
just piling in
i mean piling
some of the best scripts ive read in years
my employer will be glad to hear that
is she here
how could you miss her
he nods toward a hard faced older woman surrounded by admirers
louellas here and im talking to you
we see the open door to the bathroom
frances with a towel around her is going through connies closet
enters sees her oh no
refill my drink will you bob
aghast whatre you doing
putting on my armor
come on frances
louella parsons is here
she wants to talk to you help you out
didnt she call me a spoiled little bitch
come on shes an important columnist
whats the matter
i thought you wanted these people to forgive you
that was an unfortunate choice of words
frances pulls down a dress and inspects it
youre not kidding
firmly get me a refill bob
ill be down in a minute
he nods and retreats out the door
everyone chattering away
then hushing slightly
heads turn frances is descending the stairway in one of connies dresses
she looks absolutely radiant
like some kind of goddess
barnes looking very pleased at her appearance and the others reaction hands her the drink
then the young reporter steps forward
his callow youth act gee awful good to see ya again miss farmer
barnes looks on nervously its all becoming unravelled again
my employer would like to know something very important is it true your friend clifford sleeps in the nude
frances is broiling
she stares at him
under her steady gaze the snide smile gradually fades from his face
you seem like an intelligent young man
cant you find a more dignified way to make a living
this hits home
frances turns on her heel and leaves
frances rushes out followed by barnes and a few curious partygoers
she is very upset
holding it in
barnes pleads with her tries to stop her but she leaps in the car and speeds off spewing gravel over him
the partygoers salute her with their drinks
in the pale moonlight we see the dim outline of a poster tacked to the outside wall
the highway disappears down to the sea glittering dully in the distance
we hear the rising sound of an approaching car
its headlights crest the hill illuminating the poster showing a woman driving an open car seated beside the outline of a familiar mustached figure
the poster reads when youre riding alone youre riding with hitler
the lights grow brighter almost blinding
the car accelerating furiously flashes by
then we hear a motorcycle start up
it emerges from the blackness and speeds off in pursuit
a roadsign reads dimout zone
frances drives fast tears running her face
the motorcycle cop pulls up alongside and shouts pull over
he waves insistently
gradually she slows
he gets off his bike and walks over preparing the usual lecture
he leans over the car and sees frances her hair wild and tangled
a come on hey wheres the fire sister
sarcastic in my eyes officer
cool off beautiful
didnt you see the sign says dimout zone
switching off her lights theres a war on you know
youre seriously trying to tell me the japs cant find los angeles without my headlights
testy i didnt make the law lady
i just enforce it
she switches her headlights back on
god you bore me
she starts the car
the cop angry now lunges in and grabs the keys
dont touch me
she leaps out of the car
the cop turns off the car lights
as frances passes his motorcycle she switches on its lights
he runs after her turning off the motorcycle lights on the way
when he catches her he grabs her arm
she struggles grabs the flashlight from his belt
she switches it on and holds it high its beam spearing wildly out to sea
he lunges for it knocks her down
he rolls on top of her pinning both her arms with one hand
trying to handcuff her
she writhes knees him in the balls
she crawls away desperately clawing at loose stones
the cop angry now hurls her down again and manages to get the cuffs on
as they dig into her wrists she tries to bite him
the cop winded from the battle yanks her to her feet and drags her kicking and screaming to his motorcycle
he pulls out his radio mike
panting santa monica this is motor six sixty six
i got a live one here
close on front page of the los angeles times october
the headlines read jap ships sunk errol flynn sex trial delayed frances farmer arrested on drunk driving charge actress gets fine and six months probation
camera pulls back to show several newspapers spread out on the balcony of frances beach house
as the papers ruffle in the wind a little kitten swipes at them
frances sits in the sun writing in her diary the same one we saw at the opening of the film
a mans shoes come into got any ginger beer
she turns surprised and pleased to see him
take a look
he walks off into the kitchen
she puts her diary away
calling how the hell do you find me anyway
she laughs no ginger beer
whats this red stuff
whats left of my blood
think ill have a glass
everyone else has
harry returns sipping the drink
looking around nice joint
can you afford it
the studio pays
thank you harry
for not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter
well i would have you know
i just didnt know how to cook it
six months probation
you gotta learn when to do battle farmer
youre not going to win many bouts with pound cops
i took the early rounds
laughs ill bet
i dont know
it hurts harry
some things no matter what you do with them they just hurt
so you drink and you fight with a cop
yeah and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are whats going on inside their heads
sometimes you can hear it like a buzzing the things that happen in their heads
and you wonder does anybody ever love anybody really
i gotta get outta here
i gotta get out of this town
we see a thought come to him
hey look i got some business down in san diego
whattaya say you come with me stay a few days
no harry i cant right now youre coming
waterfront bar full of sailors whores and heavy drinkers
hanging over the bar is san diego paraphernalia
frances and harry sit at a table
heavy boozing has led to philosophizing you know
when i started acting you know what i wanted
he grunts what
i just wanted to be part of something
one thing one play or one movie something that was really fine
and i could say i did that i made something good
to get a crack at something good you gotta earn it you gotta climb the ladder first
so you do you work hard and all these people behind you are pushing you up shouting you on
and then one day you realize you are youre at the top
and theres nothing there
and you look behind you and theres no one below
youre just left there all alone
swaying in the god damned breeze
in the background we see a drunken sailor lurching toward their table
well like the man said you can make a fresh start with your last breath
the sailor trips and falls across their table spilling beer on frances and knocking things over
irritated hey watch it
eyeing her suggestively watch what
get away from me you foul slime
thats no way for a lady to talk
take a walk pal
who said i was a lady
sorry i insulted you
ahhh go eat a toilet seat
the sailor goes berserk takes a swing at frances
harry leaps in to protect her starts to fight with the sailor
frances joins in shes not going to let anyone fight her battles
the sailors buddy enters the fracas
everyones getting hit
as the melee continues we a cab pulls up
frances gets out
she looks weary and has a bruise on her cheek
a car is parked in the driveway
she frowns at it shrugs and carries her suitcase toward the house
she enters with her bags then drops them stunned
the house is stripped bare
a man holding a measuring tape comes out of the bedroom
i live here
well look they took your stuff out
moved it to some hotel i think
im preparin it for the next tenant hes coming in tomorrow
frances stares at him dumbfounded
frances on the phone
boxes spread out their contents strewn over the floor tables etc
frances is going through various piles again and again looking for something
muttering god damn it god damn it
into phone yes ill wait im waiting
to herself i dont believe this
they cant do this to me
she takes a long drink sifts through a pile then throws it on the bed in disgust
we hear a voice on the phone
into phone barnes
its my diary
they stole my fucking diary
find it will you
god damn it thats my life
she slams down the phone
the crew is idle and the director paces muttering never
i swear i swear i will never work with this broad frances looking pretty hung over enters blithely
youre four hours late
id say im behaving as professionally as anyone else in this town
where were you
terribly terribly sorry i overslept
whats the name of this fine entertainment were all so involved in
the director clenches his fists as though about to punch her
looking blearly at the slate oh yes
theres no escape
she walks to her dressing room as the director explodes anew
small cramped not like the earlier one we saw
the hairdresser whom we recognize as tora the woman who cut bebes hair stands waiting holding her brushes and looking vexed
its about time
youre not the star on this show yknow
tora begins brushing her hair yanking frances head back with each stroke
of course its not up to me to say anything
im just crew
yknow you hairs so fine youll lose it if youre not careful
wonder you all dont the things you do to yourselves
in fact i think you are already
fact i think you better frances cries out and twists around suddenly
tora is thrown back stumbling
hitting her jaw against a chair
im not taking this any more
she storms out
tora is left moaning holding her jaw
frances marches across it
when she reaches the exit door she turns and bows to them all grandiloquently
shes snoring in bed
face down spread eagled
the light is on
a whiskey bottle three quarters empty a tumbler three quarters full and a bottle of pills sit on the night table
the phone rings
she winces groans tries to open her eyes then squeezes them together hung over
her arm flails out finds the light and turns it off
the phone keeps ringing
her arm gropes for it
a loud pounding at the door
what the hells going on here
calls hold on
answering phone hello
we hear a dial tone hello
the pounding at the door becomes violent
someones breaking it down
the door splinters
men stream into the room
back lit from the hall they look like monsters phantoms
theyre carrying sticks
frances screams and runs naked into the bathroom
dont kill me
dont kill me
she slams the door on the advancing figures
frances leans her weight against the door
mama help me help me mama
dont let them kill me
its too much for her
shes shoved back falling to the floor
the door flies open revealing three large cops
leering at her
frances clutches at the shower curtain trying to cover herself
get your clothes on
crying you have no right
you have no fucking right you bastards
get the hell out of here get your clothes on lady youre under arrest
frances is being led to the booking desk
all around her photographers snap her picture and reporters walk alongside subjecting her to a never ending barrage of questions
frances just smokes a cigarette and smiles grimly at the dour faced sergeant facing her
i dont believe this
you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you dont even know who the hell i am
the photographers laugh
just put me down as a avg a vagrant vagabond
come on this is a joke
assault and battery
i barely touched that bitch
frances considers for a moment then smiles matter of factly
the sergeant reddens
frances laughs as the photographers snap their shots
two matrons escort frances to her cell
she shakes their hands off her arms and enters
they slide the door shut
photographers press up to the bars
frances calls after the matrons
id like to leave a wake up call for say ten
ill have my bread and water in bed
frances looks disgustedly at the photographers and lies down heavily on the cot
why dont you comb your hair okay
take me the way i am
frances looking disheveled dazed and over tired from a sleepless night in jail stands alone before the judge
next to the prosecutor sits tora her jaw heavily bandaged glaring at frances
the spectators section is packed
is that not true
under her breath whos writing this guys lines
answer the question
have you driven a car since you were placed on probation
no i couldnt get my hands on one
have you reported to your probation officer as directed
i never saw him
why didnt he show up
did you expect him to look you up
i wanted to get a peek at his face
suppressed laughter ripples through the courtroom
youre on your way to a contempt citation young lady
thats fine with me
turning to spectators get it
hey cmon cmon what is this an audience or a jury
miss farmer is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night
sure its true
i was fighting for my country as well as myself
miss farmer you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law abiding citizen frances moves closer to the
are you telling me you didnt have a little rum in your pineapple juice this morning
i can smell it from here your honor
the courtroom erupts into surprised laughter
frances laughs triumphantly and spears the air with her finger pointing at the judge
its the truth
i can smell it from here you old hypocrite
the laughter grows
the judge bangs his gavel
in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here
i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of days in the county jail
rising you are a deeply troubled young lady
i only hope you change your course before its too late
the judge pounds his gavel
frances is about to say something when suddenly the realization of whats happening hits her
the judge is leaving the bench
a reporter runs out of the room
frightened now wait a minute
i havent got a lawyer
the judge ignores this
shouting what i want to know is do i have any civil rights
the judge closes his chambers door behind him
frances turns slowly
the matrons are coming toward her
i want to make a phone call
she lunges at the matrons trying to get past them
i have a right to make a phone call
the reporter is phoning in his story
the hallway is pandemonium
from his notes the kleig lighted road to fame and fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair
today film star frances farmer tarnished by alcohol and drugs m i going too fast for ya
in the next phone booth we see harry listening to the reporters spiel
he regards the confusion around him with calm eyes
they burst open
the matrons and two cops come out carrying frances
reporters and photographers rush past her
theyre stealing my civil rights
im being kidnapped
oh god help me
she suddenly sees the phone booths
her eyes fill with tears her shoulders slump forward and her lower lip begins to tremble
she no longer struggles
to a matron havent you ever had a broken heart
the matron relaxes her grip and gives frances a handkerchief
frances dabs at her eyes
wraps the kerchief around her knuckles
and slugs the matron in the jaw sending her sprawling
frances runs to the phones
oh my god shes loose
frances throws herself at the door of the booth
the reporter is delirious with joy what a story
shes attacking your correspondent
right here in the court building
good god this bitch is crazy
someone stop her
frances pounds at the door a few more times then moves to the next booth
into the arms of harry
a whisper harry
harry shakes his head
before he can speak frances is grabbed from behind and dragged toward the elevator
i have a right
i have a right
into phone with what must surely be the final act of madness the curtain falls on frances farmers once promising career
the crazed blonde who at
harry opens the door to his booth
the reporter looks up at him
hold it a second bub
harry says not a word but punches the reporter hard in the face
the reporter sags out like a light
in the confusion no one has noticed a thing
harry pulls the door shut
frances is sitting in a wooden chair
the venetian blinds over the tall windows are almost completely closed
the room is dim and terribly quiet
a woman is murmuring something to a kindly looking judge
another man is standing beside her
frances cant quite make out the words
and we feel that this would be more appropriate
a difficult decision but im sure the proper one
he nods to the other man who together with the woman turn away from the bench
as they pass in front of one of the tall windows frances recognizes the woman
it is alma styles
she feels an arm slip around her shoulders and she stiffens
her mothers face appears by hers
whispering its alright now little sister everythings going to be just fine
youre not going to jail frances
the judge has put you under my care
ill see you get the rest you need
youre taking me home
two other women appear at either side of frances and lillian
lillian tenderly takes her daughters face in her hands
smiling first things first little sister
she kisses frances on the forehead
frances looks at the two women
they are smiling understandingly at lillian
frances looks a little alarmed
a wood panelled station wagon turns the corner of a tree lined road and heads up toward tall wrought iron gates
on a white washed wall are black letters meadow wood convalescent home
the station wagon a similar sign on its door pulls up
the gates swing slowly open and it travels up a long tree lined driveway
as it goes by we see frances sitting in the back seat between lillian and one of the women from the previous scene
the car heads up toward a large spanish style building set back among some trees
frances sits in front of a desk nervously smoking a cigarette
lillian stands at a window looking out at a broad expanse of well manicured lawn ending at a row of oaks in the distance
why its beautiful here
what a view
lillian smiles enthusiastically at frances who stares accusingly back shes not falling for that
an awkward moment of silence
lillian fidgets doesnt know what to say
she is rescued when the door opens and dr
symington early s glasses white coat and ingratiating smile enters
he holds his right hand out to frances
good afternoon miss farmer
frances stares at the proffered hand
lillian steps in quickly and takes it
good afternoon doctor
the doctor winks at frances and puts a hand on lillians arm
im very pleased to meet you mrs
im sure well have more of a chance to talk later
right now i think its important that your daughter have a chance to settle in
perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here
he smiles pleasantly
lillian is obviously very put off by the idea
she looks at frances who stares unseeingly out the window
well i have some background that you should probably know about if youre
i have no doubt mrs
if youll speak to the girl at the desk shell arrange an appointment
he goes to the door and opens it
lillian is momentarily at a loss but she acquiesces
she bends down and tightly hugs frances who pats her on the back a couple of times
ill be back real soon little sister
you be a good girl
she waits for a reply and then getting none starts out the door
staring out window mama
lillian turns back expectantly
warningly i want to go home mama
lillian looks to the doctor who nods sympathetically at her
youll see little sister
everything will be fine
the doctors know best
she goes out and down the hall
the doctor closes the door
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance
am i supposed to say thank you
thanks are hardly necessary
aw shucks maam
im glad to see you havent lost your sense of humor
it aint for lack of trying
so it seems
may we be serious for a moment
seductively why doctor
weve only just met
he reddens ever so slightly and looks away
i feel ive known you for a long time
you see ive followed your career
youre a fascinating case
im looking forward to resolving your predicament
frances face begins to set in hard planes
are you really
among persons such as yourself creative people under great stress erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of
its just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which
can cripple your ability to function
he stops as frances rises and leans over his desk do you expect me for one moment to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do
please sit down
you may discuss my predicament doctor
you may discuss it with anyone you like but not with me
im not interested
i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian
besides i dont want to be what you want to make me
and whats that
will you please sit down now
smiling symington says
did you really say that
just a little joke miss farmer
this whole thing is a joke
stay calm please
no you stay calm doctor
but youre finding that difficult arent you
soft seductive why are you attracted to me
perhaps later in some of our more intimate sessions
after we know each other a little better
turning harder and youve torn my personality to shreds and im weeping and vulnerable
very hard then youll really get your kicks wont you doctor
ill have someone show you to your room
oh thats good very professional
but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away
symington stares at her
with a careful almost scientific gesture he moves thumb and forefinger over his lip then rubs the two fingers together
yes there is sweat
you really should get some rest now
nurse will meet you outside
he pushes a button on his desk and reaches for a folder
frances hasnt moved
she gazes at him evenly
is there something else
you didnt say symington says
his eyes are very calm now he smiles at her patronizingly
small white spartan and rather pleasant
lillian is standing by the window testing the locks
she turns and goes to the bed fussing with the pillow seeming very uncomfortable
she pulls at the corners of the mattress
the door opens and a tall sullen looking matron walks in
lillian doesnt pay much attention to her
not much on hospital corners are you
something in her tone makes lillian look up
the matron closes the door behind her and advances
lillian assumes her full height
frances is walking with a nurse
they pass a variety of other patients some of whom look old or beaten but few of whom seem overtly crazy
so this is the nuthouse
the nurse smiles confidentially at her
take my word for it
this is a resort
they get to the door and hear lillians protesting voice you have no right
they enter and see the matron struggling to get lillians coat away from her
lillian pleads with frances
tell them who i am
tell them who i am
are you crazy
unhand that woman
thats amelia earhart
frances bursts out laughing
the matron releases lillian and comes for frances
a little fluid squirts out the tip
but what is it
camera pulls back to reveal frances strapped down on a white cot
the nurse is holding the syringe while a thin nurse and an attendant stand by
youve got to tell me what it is
it throws your body into shock
frances looks at her suspiciously uncertain whether to believe this and turns toward the nurse with the hypodermic
reassuringly its just vitamins
this sounds more reasonable
frances relaxes somewhat
a c b complex certain minerals
inserting hypo just stay relaxed
good now open your mouth a sec
the attendant jams a rubber bar between her teeth
frances squirms fights
the attendant holds the bar in place
and the nurse pushes the plunger on the hypo
frances goes rigid
her eyes widen her back arches
with a loud hoarse cry she starts to convulse
the screen begins to fade into bright white light
she is unconscious
the screen frances sits beside lillian on a bench
other patients with ground privileges wander aimlessly about
there is an open carpet bag at lillians feet and in her lap a bundle of letters and telegrams that shes showing to frances
frances seems restless
and heres the one from duluth
a war widow with five children
she works in a defense plant and shes very worried about you
i answered her that she shouldnt let worry over you affect her vital work and that youd be back on the silver screen in no time
she hands it to frances who lets it drop beside her on the bench
and heres one from nice mr
he says that
why are these all opened
well they needed immediate answers frances
its good manners and good sense
you shouldnt be bothering yourself with these right now
then why did you bring them
its your fan mail little sister
looking off under her breath you kill me mama
she looks for something to divert her attention
frances is alone in the room
the door is ajar
shes standing over symingtons desk which is empty except for a doodle pad
the doodle shes looking at is extremely bizarre sadistic
after a moment symington enters holding several folders
frances manner changes very subtly
im sorry to keep you waiting the staff review ran over
did you enjoy your mothers visit
it was very good to see her
symington puts the folders in a drawer
all except frances
not at all
she brought me my fan mail
a performance i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me
but i guess thats the best thing about working in the movies
you make so many friends
i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasnt a mistake
youre telling me you feel guilty
slightly edgy no
what i mean is
im just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life thats all
after a pause do you really believe your mothers trying to kill you
she told me you said mama you want to kill me
i never said
thats just a figure of speech
she said something funny and i said
and you accused her of tampering with your mail
oh for christs
frances is wrapping and unwrapping a handkerchief around her knuckles
looks a little crazy
symingtons watching it
she misunderstood thats all
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative
whom do you think i should believe
doctor i hate to break this to you but my mother is a little batty
frances youre still filled with anxiety
you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends
consequently i didnt recommend your release at the staff review
mental illness is an elusive thing and though im pleased youre feeling more
capable its perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time
dont you agree
frances stares at him
smiling im sure youll see it my way in the end
symington how big is your dick
cause if its long enough which i doubt why dont you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass
symington smiles patronizingly
i want outta here you understand
im ready to get out
so you go back there
you go back and you tell them to let me out
calmly frances im warning you
no im warning you
who do you think you are god
you bumble around with your folders
she knocks her folder to the floor and your pencils
she grabs some pencils and throws them at him and your god damn buttons
she pounds on the inter com a voice says yes doctor
all your badges of authority
but you have no authority
youre a zero
she tears open the door
two huge orderlies are waiting
frances tries to barrel past but they easily restrain her
symington sits forward his hands smoothing his hair
frances smiles sarcastically at him symington says
tonelessly sedate her
they haul her away
a few patients stroll about visiting with relatives
frances lies on a chaise lounge
shes wearing a robe and dark glasses a big hat and she seems to be sleeping
the camera approaches
her hair is a mess her skin splotchy
and something is moving her hand
one finger on one hand is moving in agitated little bursts
we realize she is not sleeping at all
how bout a walk in the woods
she looks to one side and sees him
takes off her glasses and runs her fingers nervously through her hair
oh my god i look awful
friendly youve looked a whole lot better
frances and harry walking in a relatively secluded area
she glances around continuously
theyre doin stuff to me harry
can you see it
you feel it
theyre putting stuff in my food or something my water and theyre using it to put thoughts in my head
theyre trying to re arrange whats in my head theyre trying to drive me crazy
she breaks down and weeps on harrys shoulder
harry looks around warily
i cant stay here anymore you understand
i cant i cant
i gotta get home
i gotta get somewhere else anywhere okay
harry nods squeezes her arm firmly a warning as a white coated attendant approaches
frances straightens up
oh miss farmer
time for your bath miss farmer
urgent whisper listen to the left
straight through the trees and over the wall to your left
my car is there
the attendant reaches them
as if to a child its time for your bath
i love my baths
come along now
frances starts to move off with the attendant
for an instant harry and we wonder if she really is crazy
did you hear what i said
the attendant turns
she smiles sweetly madly
of course harry
the attendant is between her and harry
we see her face turn dark
she shoves the attendant toward harry and shouts fiercely over the walls
the attendant staggers toward harry who knocks him down with two punches
another attendant runs up
harry whips out an icepick and brandishes it at them you want crazy
ill show you crazy
the attendants hold their ground
harry runs after frances
frances and harry crash through bushes come to a high wall
offering to lift her here
frances hugs him tightly kisses him
he lifts her by the waist and she grabs the top of the wall and hauls herself up
harry joins her
we see over the wall a lincoln zephyr waiting on a dirt road
harry and frances jump down as we hear the two attendants burst through the underbrush and haul themselves up
as their heads pop over the top of the wall they see the lincoln disappearing down the road in a cloud of dust
harry eyes bleary and shoulders hunched tries to concentrate on the road ahead
the radio drones quietly a lazy saxophone ballad
after a while theres movement in the back seat and frances sits up
she yawns and stretches as harry watches her in the mirror
yawning that sure looks like fun
leaning over front seat you know how long its been since i was behind the wheel
forget it frances
youre not driving
have i told you how mean youre turning york
frances climbs over the seat and starts to fiddle with the radio
where are we mean man
couple hours from idaho
well cut across to montana
ive got friends there with a ranch
i shouldve known
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone
smiling take advantage of me
they pass a poster buy war bonds
frances stares at it
i dont think id be much good in a war
whattaya think youre in now
sleepily i dont know
not a war exactly
its more a
a misapprehension maybe
a misunderstanding people taking the wrong meaning from things
i wasnt declaring war harry
i was just saying my prayers
harry looks at her quizzically
harry i have to go home
i have to talk to mama
frances youre fulla drugs
you dont know what youre saying
who do you think put you into meadow wood
your mother thinks youre crazy and shell keep on thinking it as long as it suits her
sitting up no she just didnt want me going to jail thats all
shes a shark frances
im not taking you there and thats that
she rubs his neck and his attitude seems to soften
she looks at him fondly thoughtfully
you know something harry
aside from meanness youre almost perfect
theres only one other thing wrong with you
you cant drink
the lincoln is parked beside a few other cars
frances and harry sit at a table cluttered with empty glasses
the jukebox plays a few couples dance
frances is gulping down a tall scotch
wincing grinning ohhh thats lousy scotch
calling drunkenly hey
another shot for the lady and a double for me
what a man
hey youre a good quarter horse kid but you cant go a route of ground
hoisting her glass to quarter horses
he knocks back his drink
a hand puts a nickel in and we hear bing crosby singing love is so terrific
we pan across the dance floor where harry and frances are dancing
love is so terrific such a funny feeling makes you want to cuddle and coo
frances squeals with delight when she hears the song
she holds harry forcefully and starts to lead him around the floor
harry starts to sing along makes you sentimental makes you kinda gentle ouch
frances pinches harry terrific thing
around them an infection is spreading all the women are leading their men
for an instant it is magical liberating
she leans her head against his shoulder
why are you always leaving me harry
you should stickaround sometimes
look out for me
look frances im only gonna ask this one time
i mean it
i swear after this ill never ask again will you marry me
after a long pause i know a thing or two about marriage
you understand me more than anyone harry
maybe even more than mama
youre too important to me
id fail you
i dont know how or why but i would
and thats a chance i just cant take
do you understand
a bitter smile well
ill act like i do until i do
they are silent for a moment
theres just one more thing
will you marry me
she laughs happily
he joins her but his seems a little forced
she leans her head on his shoulder and holds him tight
the lincoln harry at the wheel drives up and stops
harry shakes his head
its not too late to keep going up to vancouver
be the smartest thing
thanks harry really but
i cant explain it
shes my mother
i cant give up on her that easy
you give up on her
something i gotta do i guess
smiling warmly frances youre crazy
whispers i know
dont tell anyone
we see lillian come out onto the porch with uncharacteristic trepidation
if you need me
warmly i got your number mister man
she gets out waves to him and walks toward the house
harry drives off
as frances reaches the top step lillian suddenly opens her arms nervous forced welcome home little sister
frances and lillian enter
on the sofa sits alma styles
alma and lillian seem slightly furtive
caught in the act
well who have we here
anxiously frances you remember my lawyer alma styles
you seem to be having quite a time of it
i called alma because i think well need
frances the doctors at meadow wood have petitioned the court for your return
your mother has asked me to intervene so you can stay here
i swear i didnt know what they were doing to you
i wouldnt have let them
she bursts into tears
frances takes her in her arms and rocks her like a child
its okay mama
you realize of course your mother is now your legal guardian
in the eyes of the law you no longer have any rights as an adult
youre going to have to hold your tongue and be selective about whom you mix with
that man who drove you here for instance you leave him out of this
frances please dont
we wont have to worry about him much longer
harry pulls up at a stop sign
he rubs his forehead wearily as a car crosses the intersection
it stops dead in front of him
another pulls up alongside
harry thinks about this
his hand slides down slowly under the seat
we see the handle of his ice pick
harry turns to smile at the man in the next car
the man flashes an fbi badge points revolver smiling how ya doin al
you got the wrong guy
no it aint
and it aint harry york neither
look im tellin you
the fbi man pulls the hammer back on the revolver
another man opens the passenger door
id give you till ten al but we aint got the time
judge hillier walking
out of the chamber and down a corridor
his stride is long his demeanor purposeful
the corridor leads into a courtroom
harry standing at attention
we hear hillier climb onto the bench and be introduced by the court official
harry stares up at the judge
alvin hanson a
ronald burns thomas slocum harry york
hanson this warrant has been outstanding for many years
normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency but the crime you committed inciting to riot and the cause you sought to promote a workers rebellion are such anathemas to
this court that i feel compelled to mete out the full sentence
i only wish it were longer
slamming gavel six months in the state penitentiary
frances sits at the piano playing you are my sunshine
lillian is lounging on the couch leafing happily through her scrapbook
frances play flow gently sweet afton
frances brows mesh
oh mama im so
tired of that song
i want you to
it would make me so happy
frances sighs and begins to play it
lillian scrunches down and begins to hum along
its just a flow gently sweet afton day
life has been so good to me
why i have just about everything one could wish
but i still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook
she smiles warmly at frances
frances abruptly stops playing
i think i need a little air
i think ill just go out for awhile
where are you going
for a walk mama
just a walk
she gets up and lillian rouses herself
how long will you be
frances goes down the hall for her coat
lillian follows part way
smiling ill have lunch ready by one
ill be back
frances returns wearing the coat
lillian half blocking her path
say you promise
i promise ill
i promise mama
lillian nods moves aside
as frances heads for the door you know the surest way to lose an appetite is to drink little sister
exiting yes mama
i dont want you drinking frances
lillian enters and re establishes herself on the couch with a happy smile
she begins to hum flow gently sweet afton derelicts sleep on broken couches and armchairs
in a corner by a pay phone ernest farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs
frances sits across from him
theyve been talking
so what do you think
i dont know honey
your mother has such big plans for you
i know that dad but what you have to understand francie is that she
she wanted so much for herself too and for me and she never really got to
the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers
but she could have been
if times were different she could have been a politician or
i dont know
but dad im asking about me
what do you think i should do
after a pause well francie sometimes after you get your hands on something you want it just doesnt look the same
then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because its all youve got
or just let it go
this is the way of things but i guess you already know that
whatever i decide will it be okay with you
frances rises from her chair looking around the room to hide her tears
ernest rises too
im sorry i
i dont have a desk in my room and
its not a proper office i dont care dad
i love you
i love you too francie
they look at each other across the desk for an uncomfortable moment then frances slowly leaves
he looks sadly after her
frances exits and starts across the road
ernest comes to the window to watch her leave
it is raining and the water on the glass distorts his view
lillian is straightening up frances room rearranging things to suit herself
she hears the door slam downstairs
im back mama
coming into hall oh frances do i have news for you
guess who excited wait mama wait
i have something to tell you
im not going to make movies anymore
i thought thats what i wanted and i went after it with all my soul the way you taught me but i was miserable mama and it nearly killed me
now its over
i want a different kind of life something
i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful
in the country maybe and ill have dogs and cats i feel so light suddenly so clear for the first time in
its going to be okay mama i know it
and i love you
she goes to hug her mother but lillian has changed
frances news has chilled her
coming down stairs dont
entering living room they want you back
your agent called today
dont you understand
hes sending the scripts
he wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people
frances you cant do this to your fans
why theyve been praying for you all through this nightmare
you cant turn your back on them now
look at this fan mail ive been answering
she points to a stack of letters on the table
havent you heard what i said
i told him to come up
i told him you wanted to show them all that theres nothing wrong with you any more that youre completely cured
im not cured
i was never sick
they had no business putting me in there
my only responsibility is to myself now
you selfish selfish child
at least talk to him hear what he has to say
you want to throw it all away is that it
you had everything little sister
a brilliant career
a wonderful husband
you were a movie star
mama shut up
and now youre throwing everything away
youre gonna be a nobody
you know what thats like
sudden realization you
youd send me back wouldnt you
frances grabs her coat
where are you going
im going out
youre not going anywhere
yes i am and you cant stop me
you cant tell me what to do mother
im a grown woman and i can decide about my own life
theyre wrestling lillian trying to prevent her from leaving
dont you try and stop me
dont you dare
she grabs lillians wrists and twists them throws her back
if you follow me mama i swear ill fucking kill you
frances storms out
lillian sits back in the chair suddenly looking very old
she massages her wrists
youve done it now little sister
we see a single light with a green shade hear the soft coo of lillians voice
the camera shifts gradually onto her earnest face
all my life ive tried to live up to my parents example
to have the independence of mind and fortitude of spirit that have made this country great
i taught that to frances speak out
make something of yourself something to be proud of bored yes yes mrs
farmer frances has always been a battleground lillian
doyle a psychiatrist and the others are seated with judge hillier around a table
the point is its your opinion that frances is getting steadily worse
doyle fills in a line on the printed form before him
and you feel youre unable to control her any longer
i mean yes doctor
alma holds up lillians bruised wrists as evidence
and the only course open to you is to commit your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution
well alma told me that
alma looks coolly at lillian
hillier nods slightly approvingly toward alma
closing his folder i believe thats all i need to know about miss farmer
i think in all future documents she should be referred to as mrs
her married name
its less recognizable
im sure youd prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum
can you tell us where we might find frances
frances stands at the bar acting out a joke for a small audience of devoted drinkers
looking for a drink and the town is deserted he cant understand it
finally he finds a bar goes in the place is empty bartenders closing up
salesman says gimme a martini
bartenders real nervous he says no no no i gotta close
big otis is coming to town
behind them is a large window covered by a gauzy curtain
in the street a police car cruises slowly past
salesman says i dont care
i gotta have a martini
so the bartender fixes him a martini real fast grabs his money and runs out the back
salesman sits there sipping his martini
hes got the bar all to himself
then he hears it
this big roaring in the street
stomping her feet gigantic footsteps
we see the police car again
it stops out front
enormous hands reach in grab the swinging doors and rip them off their hinges
this huge man stomps in
picks up a chair and hurls it over the bar smashing the mirror whiskey and glass flying everywhere
two cops appear at the window looking in
he turns to the salesman what the hellre you doing in here
salesman says im just drinking a martini
the guy says
well you better get outa here
big otis is coming to town
a long moment of enjoyment
then frances turns looks out the window and sees the cops
hillier behind the bench
doyle sits at a table with alma styles
a court recorder taps out his notes in an odd jerky style
note this scene is intercut where appropriate with shots of frances in a bare room wearing a strait jacket
from her history its apparent the patient suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism
her violent responses have recently included aggression against her mother
in view of the deep seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond satisfactorily to insulin shock it is my opinion she may ultimately require permanent institutional care
to styles counsellor as guardian ad litem for mrs
richardson do you waive jury trial
yes your honor
she signs a paper which is passed to hillier
having heard the testimony of a legally qualified and reputable physician
and being further satisfied of the truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician i do hereby order that the said mrs
richardson an insane person be confined to the western state hospital for the insane at steilacoom
he bangs his gavel
are the gentlemen from steilacoom present
huge dark red brick buildings with barred windows loom out of the fog and trees
a van pulls up to the front entrance
two men get out open the back doors and assist frances out
she is strapped into a strait jacket
she yells and struggles violently but a piercing scream stops her
she looks up at the building
from a top floor window a thin white hand protrudes from the bars and waves hello
frances is dragged kicking and screaming down the shiny linoleum covered hallway
there are many patients here talking to imaginary birds laughing at unheard jokes
a few of them notice frances most do not
the two orderlies arrive at a door and throw it open
a bare room is revealed with a narrow cot and no windows
frances is pushed inside and the door locks shut with a resounding click
a medical student wheels a small electrical machine up to a table
on the table frances is securely strapped down
two doctors grease frances temples and put two metal electrodes on them
the electrodes are connected to the machine
whats she getting anyway
standard series to start
doctor nods and jams a rubber bar into frances mouth
the medical student steps forward
can i push the button on this one
doctor shoots a silent query to doctor
the medical student pushes the button with great gravity
frances body immediately begins to convulse
it seems as if it will never stop
beds three inches apart
women patients lie on them in varying stages of madness and decay
some are bound to their beds with coarse cloth strips
one bed is empty the bonds chewed through
we find frances sitting on the floor staring at a hissing radiator
her lips are caked with blood
her eyes are glazed
she is dreaming
a scene from one of her movies or plays
she looks radiant vivacious alive
a nurse ushers frances and two attendants into a sparse tiled room with dilapidated plumbing and fungus growing between the tiles
in the center are three steel baths with hammocks suspended above them
the attendants strap frances into a bath as dr
speaking with difficulty doctor it may sound odd but i believe ive profited from my stay here
its just what ive needed to get away like this
but im recuperated now
ive had lots of time to think and ive made a few decisions about my life
im ready to get on with it
i know you believe that
im afraid not
you see we observe things that youre unaware of signs indicators
your problem cuts very deep frances and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out youll really feel secure
does that make sense
the attendants lower her into the empty tub
cut this runaround doctor
i know better
smiling listen to yourself frances
the resistance the anger in your voice
im sorry forgive me
doctor tell me honestly what do i have to do to get out of here
be patient thats all
take an interest in your treatment and dont dwell on your resentments
youll be yourself again i assure you
well talk more about this
ill see you later
if im not myself now just who do you think i am
the doctor smiles sympathetically
as he turns to leave frances laughs triumphantly
the two attendants lower her into the bath and begin to fill it with ice cold water
what the hell
they shove a rubber bit between her teeth
she immediately spits it out and defiantly starts to sing in order to keep her teeth from chattering
everyone eating gruel
a parade of lunatics
the edge of incipient violence is palpable
frances eats listlessly
others are playing with their food devouring it ravenously fondling each other
suddenly a call starts up at the far end of the hall
other voices join in
at first we dont understand it but gradually the words become clear come and get it
come and get it
come and get it
the whole hall joins in
the nurses make no effort to stop it
others at frances table smile at her try to push her to her feet
when they succeed the hall breaks into applause and a new chaotic chant we want frances
we want frances
the chant is quickly silenced by hushing sounds
everyone is watching frances
she climbs up on her bench
her eyes are glazed her face expressionless
this feels like some kind of automatic behavior
she takes an exaggerated posture and speaks in almost a whisper come and get it
the hall breaks into riotous applause catcalls stomping
frances climbs down from her bench
that was the entire performance
two dark figures move stealthily along the shadow of the main building
a little ways ahead a door opens sending a shaft of light across the ground
the two men duck back into the shadows
five young soldiers exit paying off and waving goodbye to one of the orderlies
the door closes
they head off down the road laughing and joking together
the two men emerge from the shadows and approach the door
they try the handle
the first one in is harry followed by the other man carrying a rolled up bundle
we see harry and the other man now wearing a white doctors coat walking quickly down a dim hallway
they come to a large door with a barred window
the man fiddles with a keyring and unlocks the door
we hear the door lock behind them
just inside the door the doctor flicks on a flashlight and they walk down the center of the room
the beam of light sweeps over women patients in their cots crammed side by side
some are asleep others stare blankly at the ceiling
a few smile invitingly at the two men whispering obscenities
the light falls on a bedraggled woman hunched over in a corner between the wall and a cot
it is frances
harry goes to her putting his arms around her
she is very heavily sedated
tears spring to harrys eyes
frances its me harry
touch me again and ill kill you you pig
watch out harry
let me look her over
harry is on the verge of tears
lets get her out of here tonight right now
lets take her with us
the hearings tomorrow
if she gets out legally they cant come after her
look at her
shell never pass that sanity test tomorrow
im taking care of that harry
just hold her
pulling a hypodermic from his pocket reserpine
i guarantee you thisll clear her head
shell wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing
harry holds her around the shoulders and straightens out her arm
frances starts to struggle and moan loudly
she knows about these
shut her up
harry glares at the doctor but puts a hand over her mouth and the doctor injects her
her arm is covered with sores
tenderly youll be okay honey
hes just givin you something to make you think so that tomorrow you can tell em what they want to hear okay
tell em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you and youre grateful
the doctor withdraws the hypo and massages her arm
this stuff takes pretty quick
grabbing harry please
other women in the ward cry out take me
pulling harry lets get out of here
ill lose my job
frances we gotta do it this way
just remember tomorrow remember what i told you
whatre you gonna tell em
groggily im grateful
very worried harry
i gotta go now
the two men come out and the doctor quickly locks the door
were all square now harry
all square doc
cause i dont want to see you again
frances face appears at the tiny barred window
we can just hear her i love you harry
i love you
i love you too frances
behind frances we hear the women screaming i love you harry
the doctor takes harrys arm and pulls him down the corridor
frances turns to face the women in their cots
she is practicing tomorrows speech
i realize now that i was a very sick woman
i couldnt relate to others in a normal way
playful warning shes
the others laugh
we realize that if frances can handle this she can sail through it tomorrow
the catcalls gradually diminish as she concludes her speech
and i was not taking responsibility for my actions
but now thanks to your treatment i feel ready to face myself ready to resume the career which i so single handedly shattered
i only hope
i hope i can make you all proud of me
thank you so much
the room is silent now
a very odd moment
to their astonishment the other patients seem to believe her
the vegetable garden is overgrown the paint peeling
the house is in disrepair but we can tell from the freshly mowed lawn that some effort has recently been made
a car pulls up
frances kisses ernest on the cheek and gets out
as he drives off she walks into the yard and looks around heaves a sigh shes home
then christmas lights spring on over the porch
lillian comes out grinning broadly followed by reporters
frances sits on the couch next to lillian
theyre sipping tea and answering questions
frances is uncomfortable
of course she hasnt anything definite in mind
no it all depends on what offers i get
who did your hair frances
she touches it shyly
its swept up in a continental style
well i like to try different styles
sometimes if youre old fashioned enough you find youre modern
what do you think of all this mrs
its a miracle
just a miracle
the porch light goes out
shadows pass over the curtained windows
across the street a match flares
harry is leaning against a tree
he lights a cigarette and settles back to wait
lillian walks from room to room turning off lights
frances is neatly stacking the dessert dishes on a tray
very domestic out of character
she carries the tray into the kitchen
oh just leave those things for now
no mama ill take care of it
ill wash them in the morning
lillian smiles warmly at her
you know little sister i never resented you for refusing to see me in the
i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back
thank you for understanding mama
lillian links her arm with frances and they go upstairs together
little sister i dont want you to feel any rush to get back to work
i want you to rest
for a while anyway
i will i promise
they hug each other
good night dear
lillian waits until frances has shut her door before closing hers
the front door opens and frances suitcase in hand slips out onto the porch
she eases the door shut behind her tiptoes down the steps and without looking back starts down the road
frances rounds the corner then sees him harry standing by his car smiling
she approaches him tentatively
this is it kid
this is our chance
when you got a chance you better take it
i dont know
you dont need to screw around anymore
you dont need dwayne steele or odets or your mother
you need me
i know but
there were so many people in there harry
every time i turned around someone was pressing against me
watching looking over my shoulder touching me grabbing sticking things into me
when i feel somebody near me now
my skin starts to crawl
she turns and stares at him sadly
you cant change the things they did to me harry
only i can do that
he nods slowly
been a lot of years you know
a long time waiting
end up feeling like a sap
oh please harry
dont even think it
youre the only person who ever
cant you wait for me
i dont know
getting frantic yes you do
if you love me you can wait right
a month six months whatever it takes
time has a way of no harry its not time its us
you and me
and im telling you now that ill come to you okay
ill find you
smiles wistfully i hope so frances
together for an instant
then she shivers as if the contact were too much
disentangling im sorry
he nods looks at her
ill be seeing you kid
he turns and walks slowly to his car
the middle of nowhere
a lone male hitchhiker poor stands at a crossroads
a car coming the wrong direction raises dust along the highway
it slows stops and lets frances out
she is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt
she has a heavy tan
she glances across at the hitchhiker and nods casually
he responds in kind
a relaxed silence follows
two strangers passing
his voice when he speaks is gentle calm pretty morning
nods its always beautiful at this time
and no people
where you goin
wherever theyre going im going
yeah i know what thats like
where you been
well i was picking fruit with some migrant workers until
she sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car
she averts her face
then tries to hide her gesture
whats the matter
frances sighs as the cop car speeds away
theyre looking for you huh
shes uncertain whether to trust him
takes the plunge yeah
whatd you do
you know ive never been able to figure that out
she shivers slightly pulls her clothes around her
he takes out a small flask and offers no strings ive got a little whiskey here warm you up
she smiles truly grateful thank you
then she sees a ball of dust nearing
a car on his side
maybe theyll pick you up
the car stops
its lights flashing
cops jump out
the hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the cops progress but is tossed aside
the cops are slowly inevitably gaining on her
frances and ernest walk out the door followed by a portly sheriff
he watches them get in ernests car and drive off
his expression says very clearly im glad thats over with
ernests at the wheel frances at his side
silence then dad
why dont you stop at a side road and let me out
ernest writhes slightly with discomfort
francie you know i cant do that
its such a simple thing
you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again
theyll just catch you again francie
besides your mother will know
we see them approaching a side road
you dont have to stop just slow down
you can tell mama i jumped out
she knows thats the kind of thing id do
she wont blame you
but i gave her my word
besides shes still your legal guardian
my hands are tied
they are nearer the side road
you know where youre taking me
you know what shell do
just give me a minute slow down give me an instant for once in your life please
they pass the side road
it disappears behind them
all the life seems to drain from frances
ill try to protect you francie
i will ill talk to her
well have a real talk
frances buries her face in her hands
are you hungry
i pity us dad
i pity us both
lillian is sitting on the couch waiting
we hear a car pull up outside and stop
steps come up the walk and onto the porch
the door opens and frances and ernest enter
lillian rises to face her daughter
coldly do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath
i was hoping for a kind word little sister
you were hoping for a kind word
youre my mother
youre supposed to nourish me
through the window we see a white van pull up outside
all youve done is try to break my spirit try to turn me into you
but im not you mother and i never will be and thank god for it
to ernest that goes for you too
and frankly i dont know how with the two of you i turned out as sane as i am to the men in white coats who are at the door
wait right there gentlemen ill be with you in a minute
and believe me i dont want to stay here one second longer than i have to
turning back but ive got to tell you lillian that one day before you die you will realize what youve done and hang your head in shame
but what have i done
youre not talking now
you can send me away lillian you can pretend im crazy and pretend im still your little girl who cant take care of herself but one thing you cant pretend
you cant pretend i love you because i dont
not after what youve done to me
because you see
im still me
im trying real hard all this time to be me
and you little sister you havent been any help at all
walking out the door okay boys im ready
the way she goes out that door we know shes never coming back
the ward is a huge room packed with nearly naked women their hair cropped very short
the walls are corrugated tin nailed to bare wood framing
the place looks like an enormous tool shed
the sound of garbled voices and screaming never stops
these are the forgotten ones
everyone here has lost any notion of what they might have once been
their faces are slack only their eyes glow with an animal ferocity
some wander aimlessly about unheeding of others who are pushing kicking and screaming at them
many squat in the dirt by the walls mired in their own urine and excrement chanting wordlessly to themselves
some appear lifeless their prone bodies shoved out of the way
some women are involved in violent sex with themselves or each other some in mindless fist fights
in a far corner we see a group of men in various military and medical uniforms their backs to us facing the wall grouped around something
we hear their cheering and laughing and joking slapping each other on the back
we slowly move closer and can see over their shoulders the object of their hilarity
its frances lying naked and spread eagled on the floor
four hospital attendants pin her arms and legs
a soldier his pants down around his ankles is squirming violently on top of her
frances eyes are open but glazed her face turned away from her attacker
she is passive and unresisting
she is reciting to herself over and over
we shall hear the angels we shall see the whole sky all diamonds
two of the soldiers waiting their turn are smoking cigarettes and chatting idly
best deal i ever made
twenty bucks to fuck a fuckin movie star
yeah its worth it i guess
whats she saying anyway
shes crazy aint she
frances keeps reciting as one rapist gets off
the soldiers cheer as another quickly takes his place
a heavy snow is falling
from the corrugated tin violent ward a thin white hand protrudes from a narrow window to catch a snowflake
as it opens and closes capturing individual flakes a voice begins to sing you are my sunshine
we recognize frances voice still surprisingly strong and steady
two nurses discuss frances condition as we see background that she is getting electroshock treatments from a pair of doctors
i dont know why they even bother
shes had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant
nods i checked the files
this one holds the record for shock treatments
four hundred seventeen and no end in sight
wincing youre kidding
indicating the doctors yeah well you know doctors
they sure hate to use that word
frances barely conscious lies strapped to a bed
doyle and an orderly approach her
doyle nods toward her as if to say that one
he and the orderly unstrap her
to doyle harry
oh harry i knew youd come
i love you harry
take me home harry
well get you home frances
thank you harry
the orderly helps her up onto a gurney
she lies down
doyle nods to the orderly who starts pushing her
she is wheeled out and down past other patients doctors etc
we see some of this from her point of view
she goes through two swinging doors down another hall
at the end of which a man opens a door
she is pushed onto a she is wheeled into a row
between two other patients
in the background we hear a voice one merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe manipulating it so as to sever the nervous
connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain
the lights are bright on her and the other patients
we cannot see but we sense an audience watching
because of the speed and simplicity of the operation i am able as you are seeing to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour
frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling
its moving round and round
the voice drones on
the operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever
we now see vaguely that dr
harlington has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney
we have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective but until now it couldnt be applied on a large scale
the old procedure required a full days work by a surgical team to perform a single operation
in the same time working alone i can treat fifty
frances turns and stares mutely without emotion at whats happening next to her the leucotome an ice pick like instrument is inserted into a womans eye socket
this procedure works best on patients with extreme over reactions to emotional stimuli
it can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment
the leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted
in plain language my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas
along with the cure comes a loss of affect
a kind of emotional flattening
frances turns away and stares at the fan again
there is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring
with diminished creativity and imagination
patients become like good solid cake with no icing
but after all it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed
we glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn
these patients will soon be leaving the hospital
harlingtons face moves vaguely into frances view
lobotomy gets em home
he moves directly over frances his pleasant face obscuring the fan
as the leucotome descends we total disrepair peeling paint broken steps fallen shingles
this house is easing slowly back to nature
neglect is just as evident inside
dust faded rugs torn yellow curtains
lillian sits on the couch staring out a window
she has aged and looks tiny frail with no trace of her old formidability
the scrapbook is open on her lap
what was i saying
oh yes it was the communists that did it to frances
ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace
four reporters crouch on the floor totally bored
yesterdays headlines are now old news
they capture the mind by first seducing the heart
i suppose i never taught frances to close her heart
two reporters rise and edge toward the door
excuse us mrs
were going to have to
rising yeah i better pack it in too
oh would you like more lemonade
the last reporter gets to his feet
kindly i think weve had enough
thank you mrs
he follows the others out
lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window looks out
ernest stares into the fire
you know ernie i think we should have frances room repainted for when she comes home
thatll brighten her day
ernest looks at her wearily as if she is stark raving mad
he knows damn well frances isnt coming home
fade in on a television screen against a dark background the show is this is your life
we see a smiling ralph edwards reading from a large black book
next to him stands frances
she has aged dramatically but is still a very handsome woman
she seems uncomfortable
dwayne steele divorced you and from this point on your story takes a darker turn
shunned by the hollywood you criticized so harshly alienated from your family and friends you turn your back on professional commitments in new york and alcohol and drugs enter your
these are sad desperate times for you
throughout this frances jaw works slowly back and forth not from anger but in embarrassment and doubt
until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution
were you mentally ill frances
i dont believe i ever was sick
but when youre treated like a patient long enough youre apt to act like one
we move away from the screen to see that the tv set is in the living room of a comfortable tastefully furnished home
on the couch in front of the set sits harry york
he still looks athletic young for his age
tears stream down his cheeks
were you an alcoholic
were you a drug addict
on the screen edwards has moved frances over to a seating area where various people from frances life are waiting smiling at her
weve never seen any of them before
and over producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight
so who knows frances farmer anythings possible on your comeback trail
indicating seating area and since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere look what weve got for you
the curtains behind them open to reveal a car in a spotlight
a brand new edsel
the audience applauds
frances smiles guardedly
thank you ralph
thank you frances
and after the show were hosting a reception for you and your friends at hollywoods own roosevelt hotel
so frances farmer this is your life
god bless you
the audience applauds
frances smiles wearily and accepts congratulations
a group of people are coming down the front steps frances among them
they all talk happily frances is silent but smiling
where shall we drop you frances
no someones picking me up
the people all excuse themselves calling goodbye
frances waits by herself for a few moments but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk
harry is leaning against the side of a building looking much as he did when they first met
but there is very little light of recognition in frances eyes
i want to talk to you
why harry york
how nice to see you
harry is a little puzzled by her reaction
how ya doin farmer
fine thank you
did you watch the show
sure i did thats why im here
concerned how did i look
a glimmer but she does not pick up on the cue well
youre looking well
they are both silent a long moment
i got a new car
only its red
did you know mama died
yeah i heard about that
i sold the house
im a faceless sinner harry
why do you say that
id ask you to take me home but im a faceless sinner
she smiles you smell good harry
familiar you know
id ask you to take me home but
harry is alarmed now
taking her by the arm frances
she angrily bares her teeth then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid
dont get mad at me harry
some things happen for the best
she takes his hand as if to shake it
harry clasps hers tenderly
she holds on like an old woman stroking his hand
for an instant she gets lost in time just holding his hand
then she looks up
its going to be slow from now on
do you know what i mean harry
im not sure
uncertainly but were not going to stop are we
reassured no were not
it is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will
but the words bear no emotional power
it was very good to see you again
would you like me to walk a little way with you
that would be okay
just a little way
he offers his arm
she takes it
all rather formal
they stroll on together
