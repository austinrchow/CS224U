the comatose bride
the man from okinawa
showdown at house of blue leaves
can she backe a cherry pie
the lonely grave of paula schultz
the cruel tutelage of pai mei
elle and i
the blood splattered bride we hear labored breathing
revenge is a dish best served cold old klingon proverb breathing continues
then a mans voice talks over the breathing do you find me sadistic
black and white cu of a woman lying on the floor looking up
the woman on the floor has just taken a severe spaghetti western style gang beating
her face is bloody beaten up and torn
the high contrast b w turning the red blood into black blood
a hand belonging to the off screen mans voice enters frame holding a white handkerchief with the name bill sewn in the corner and begins tenderly wiping away the blood
from the young womans face
little by little as the male voice speaks the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the audience
but what cant be wiped away is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her the bill of the title
in another age men who shook the world for their own purposes were called conquerors
in our age the men who shake the planet for their own power and greed are called corrupters
and of the worlds corrupters bill stands alone
for while he corrupts the world inside himself he is pure
i bet i could fry an egg on your head about now if i wanted to
he continues wiping away the blood
no kiddo id like to believe even now youre aware enough to know there isnt a trace of sadism in my actions
okay maybe towards these other jokers bot not your
we see for a moment a wide shot looking down at the woman on the floor
bill from behind bent down over her
four others in black suits standing over her three are female one is male
and about four dead bodies lying in their own blood
we also see were in a wedding chapel thats been redecorated by blood death and gunfire
and firstly or lastly depending on the viewer that the woman on the floor is dressed in a white bridal gown
this woman is our heroine and from this moment forth she will only be referred to as the bride
back to cu of the bride
the bride on the floor
her pretty face is wiped clean
no kiddo at this moment this is me at my most masochistic
while still in her cu the bride speaks for the first time in the picture
she looks up at the man standing over her and says bill im pregnant
its your baby
after saying the y in baby we hear a bang and the bride receives a bullet in the side of her head
black screen presentation credit the th film by b w cu of a young man in a tuxedo
shot to death
the bride speaks to us in a vo thats tim arthurs best friend
cu a pretty young woman in a frilly pink dress with two bullet holes in her
thats his girlfriend janeen
cu a plump young woman shot to death wedding bouquet still clutched in her dead fist
thats my best friend from work erica
an older man in a black suit shot fulla holes
thats the minister
i think his name was reverend hillhouse
a dead older woman by his side in an old fashioned flower print dress
thats his wife
a dead older woman slumped over an organ
organ player dont know her name
the name on his drivers license was charles arthur plympton but for some reason he preferred arthur
maybe if he went by carles people would have called him charlie
if that was his reason for going by arthur i can understand it
nothing wrong with the name charlie except he didnt look like a charlie he looked like an arthur
obviously youll have to take my word on this
speaking of names i was about two seconds away from becoming mrs
charles arthur plympton
and then finally the bride
and that thats me
im the bride
we do a dissolve from the bride looking dead in the bridal gown to the bride still in b w still in a bridal gown but the asswippin she took
in the scene before must have been in the past because she looks like a million dollars now
three million even
the bride behind the wheel of a volkswagen karman ghia convertible
her long blodne hair whipping in the wind
a process shot plays behind her
looked dead didnt i
well i wasnt but it wasnt for lack fo trying i can tell you that
actually bills last bullet put me in a coma
a coma i was to lie in for five years
when i woke up
i went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a roaring rampage of revenge
i roarded and i rampaged and i got bloody satisfaction
in all ive killed people to get to this piont right now
i have only one more
the last one
the one im driving to right now
the only one left
and when i arrive at my destination
im gonna kill bill
as a female sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the soundtrack we see the credits of kill bill play over the bride in her bridal gown driving to the
the sequence ends with the bride arriving at bills home
chapter one ex cu the brides eyeball in glorious color cu of the bride in glorious color shes sitting in a parked pickup truck
her eyes focused on something
the brides pov a very homey three bedroom house in the affluent suburb of pasadena california
a purple dodge neon sits parked in the driveway
a tricylce a big wheel and a few toys sprinkle the grass on the front yard
a mailbox with the name the bells on it sits out in front of the lawn
we hear but dont see ice cream truck bells
the city of we hear a car door open and close
the bride walks into the shot heading for the front door
ex cu a long white female finger pushes a doorbell
the front door opens and an attractive black housewife the same age as the bride stands in the doorway
the housewifes face shows immediate recognition of the blonde on her doorstep
the bride on the porch we do a quick shaw brothers style zoom into her eyes
that means our heroine is remembering something and we see it with an orange filter
were back inside the wedding chapel
the bride is taking the beating of her life by four people in black suits
a black woman punches her in the face
we see its the black housewife five years earlier
the bride on the porch we zoom quick out of her eyes to cu a vengeance theme plays loud on the soundtrack
whenever we hear this theme throughout the picture well quickly learn what accompanies it is the bride goin krakatoa all over whoevers ass happens to be in front of her
at that moment
as the vengeance theme plays a vein in the brides forehead begins to pulsate
when the vengeance theme stops the bride attacks the housewife
the white woman and the black woman fly into the center of the living room crashing onto her coffe table in front of the sofa
these two wildcats go at each other savagely tumbling over the couch clawing and scratching all the way landing together on the plush carpet
the housewife kicks the bride sending her crashing backwards into the small table where the phone a note pad for messages and the mail is kept
the housewife scrambles up on her feet but is caught by a flying tackle from behind by the bride that sends them both into
an ornamental iron and tempered glass bookcase that has framed family photos display toys some african art and a collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the negro experience in the
starting with a plate featuring cripis atkins in the revolutionary war negro troops in union blue during the civil war buffalo soldiers fighting indians the jim crow troops of the
first world war the colored troops of world war two korea vietnam and finally colin powell
the bride and the housewife crash through all this reducing everything to rubble
they land hard on the floor covered in broken glass locked in grapple each trying to get the best of the other one
when the housewife headbutts the bride in the nose
the housewife hops off the bride runs into the kitchen opens a drawer and comes out with a huge motherfuckin butcher knife
the bride rises from the floor and whips out a knife in a sheath hanging from her belt known as a sog
a sog is a long double edged knife thats as sharp as a razor and is what navy seals use to kill humans with
the bride backs up into the mess of the now totally demolished living room
the two woman stalk each other each holding her blade each looking like they know how to use it each waiting for the other to make a mistake so they
can plunge their blade deep into the other one
blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women locked in life and death combat
when the back kitchen door opens and a four year old little girl carrying a lunch box steps inside
mommy im home
the two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat concentration suddenly switch upon hearing the four year olds voice
the housewifes eyes flash a look of pleading to the eyes of the bride
the bride seems to answer back okay
the black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons behind their backs as the four year old little girl walks into the newly destroyed living room
the housewife switches to her mommy voice
hey baby how was school
the little girl is flabbergasted at the mess and the condition of her mother who looks like shes just been in a bar room brawl
mommy what happened to you and the t
oh that good for nothin dog of yours got his little ass in the living room and acted a damn fool thats what happened
barney did this
she says it with the slightest hint of skepticism then tries to enter the living room
now baby you cant come in here theres broken glass all over the floor and you gonna cut yourself
the little girls eyes go to the blonde lady in the living room who she aint never seen before who also looks like shes been fighting
the bride smiles at the confused little girl
this is a old friend of mommys i aint seen in a long time
hello sweety im bleep whats your name
whenever during the picture somebody says the brides real name it will be bleeped out on the soundtrack
that is till i want you to know
the shy suspicious little girl doesnt say anything she just stares at the blond lady
her name is nikki
what a pretty name for such a pretty little girl
how old are you nikki
nikki still says nothing only stares
nikki bleep aked you a question
to the bride im four
four years old aye
you know i once had a little girl
shed be five right now
maybe you two could of played with each other
now baby me an bleep have some grown up talk to talk about so you go in your room now and leave us alone till i tell you to come
the child doesnt move so the mother repeats herself
snapping her fingers nikkia in your room now
the little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the door of her bedroom
the two women turn to face each other masquerade and combat both finished
want some coffee
the two women move into the kitchen
the bride re sheaths her sog and the housewife puts the butcher knife back in the drawer
the bride sits down at the kitchen table while the housewife pours both of them coffee
cream and sugar
as the housewife fixes the coffee we hear the brides this pasadena homemakers name is jeanne bell
her husband is dr
but back when we were acquainted five years ago her name was vernita green
her code name was cobra
mine was black mamba
the two combat artists sit at the kitchen table drinking coffee out of vernitas coffee mugs
were you expecting me
yes and no
bill got in touch with me right after you woke up and then again a little later after your episode in japan
pause so i suppose its a little late for a apology huh
you suppose correctly
even if i was sincere
im quite positive youre sorry now
vernita says to the bride across the table furiously but with low volume look bitch i need to know if youre gonna start anymore shit around my baby girl
you can relax for now
im not going to murder you in front of your daughter
thats being more rational than bill led me to believe you were capable of
well thats a demonstration of bills complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me and what im thinking and what i might do
its mercy compassion and forgiveness i lack not rationality
she pauses for effect the ham
ill wait for now but i wont wait for long
ill allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again preferably as far away from nikki as possible
i could have just hit you i didnt i demand respect for that
since this is not a hit consider it a duel
and as two former deadly vipers we will observe viper rules of honor
one on one no help no bushwhackin no treacherous weapons on weapon of choice our skill and our bodies
vernita says her name im not through telling you
failure to keep our date or duplicity of any kind will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of
a building across the street from nikkis elementary school
now feel free to respond
i know i fucked you over
i fucked you over bad
i wish to god i hadnt but i did
the blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face
if i could go back in a machine i would but i cant
all i can tell you is im a different person now
i dont care
be that as it may i know i do not deserve mercy or forgiveness
however i beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter
bitch you can stop right there
the b word stops vernita short almost like a cold handed slap in the face it should affect the audience that way as well
leans in close just because i have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter does not mean parading her around in front of me is going
to inspire sympathy
you and i have unfinished business
and not a goddamn fuckin thing youve done in the subsequent five years including getting knocked up is going to change that
you have every right to wanna get even but thats where youre wrong vernita
i dont want to get even
to get even even steven
i would have to kill you go into nikkis room kill her then wait for your old man dr
bell to come home and kill him
that would make us even
no my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mothers hands
vernita knows no matter what else is said blood will spill
when do we do this
it all depends
when do you want to die
the day after tomorrow
thats about as long as ill wait
how bout tonight bitch
theres a baseball diamond where our little league has its games about a mile from here
we meet there around two thirty in the morning dressed all in black your hair in a black stocking and we have us a knife fight we wont be bothered
i have to fix nikkis cereal
as they continue to talk vernita pulls down a cereal bowl for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter
bill said you were one of the best ladies hed ever seen with an edged weapon
vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet and pulls down a box of the sugar cereal kaboom
fuck you bitch i know he didnt qualify it so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass black mamba
snorts to herself black mamba i shoulda been motherfuckin black mamba
as the two females continue to talk vernita reaches her hand inside the cereal box
weapon of choice
and if you want to stick with your butcher knife im cool with that
vernita fires a gun from inside the cereal box at the bride
the bullet explodes out of the cardboard box and hits the coffee mugh directly in front of the bride blowing it to the bride throws herself on the floor
vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and firees again
the bullet hits the floor of the tiny kitchen
the bride moves under the kitchen table then using her back lifts the table off the ground ramming it straight into vernita pinning her flat up against the table top
and the kitchen counter
while her left hand holds the table her right hand goes to the sog on her belt her fingers wrap around the blades grip lifting it up out of the
sheath and plunging it through the table top up to the handle with all the sogs steel entering vernitas abdomen
the table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker pinned to it
the two former colleagues meet eyes
sorry bout the bushwhack
do to your daughter what you did to mine
she takes her hand i wont
the bride removes her sog looks up and sees little nikki standing in the doorway of her room
the little girl sees her mother dead on the floor lying in her own blood
and she sees the blonde lady standing over her mother bloody knife still in her hand
but oddly enough nikki doesnt cry
the little girl locks eyes with the big girl and holds her stare
as she talks to the little girl she removes an already stained with blood white handkerchief with the name bill sewn on it
and the blonde wipes the girls mothers blood off her blade
it was not my intention to do this in front of you
for that im sorry
but you can take my word for it your mother had it coming
when you grow up if you still feel raw about it ill be waiting
and with that apology statement and invitation the bride walks out the kitchen side door leaving the little girl to her mourning
the bride walks down the dead womans driveway to her vehicle
she glances at the lawn toys one more time as she makes here getaway
she climbs into her big yellow pickup truck with the words pussy wagon written across the flatbeds hatch door in a pimpy font
she takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a page thats headline reads on the pager are five names numbered going down the page written in red ink
the first name has a line drawn through it with black ink
the second name on the list is the bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through vernitas name
turns on the trucks engine and drives out of the residential district
chapter two the comatose bride cu the comatose bride lying in her hospital bed wide open unblinking sightless eyes that constantly stare yet see nothing
the bride is at the beginning of her comatose journey
under her face
five years and four months earlier in the city of el paso texas although were only in a tight cu we can tell a few things one shes in her
hospital room two shes alone three its night and four one hellva rainstorm is pounding outside
the rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital
the wheel to an alfa romeo rolls into frame and stops
the car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the wet night
a red umbrella opens as rain falls down
cu the back of a head wearing a yellow rainslicker hood framed by the red umbrella above it which water cascades down and beats a rhythm against
the figure in the yellow rainslicker with the red umbrella who we can guess is female starts walking towards the hospital
left side right side cu the brides unblinking the back of the yellow comatose sleep
slicker walking in the rain towards the hospitals entrance
cu her yellow galoshes slapping against the wet asphalt and splashing through puddles
cu the bride in her coma cu the hospitals electrical doors we follow behind the woman in the raincoat as she walks from outside into the hospital down the hall
and into the ladies room door
cu the bride ex cu of a white in her coma womans shapely stepping into a sheer white stocking
the liquid is drawn up into the syringe
a lethal cocktail of bills own concoction
he calls it goodbye forever
on top of the womans blonde head
the door marked ladies is opened and a beautiful foot blonde in a white nurses uniform with a matching white eye patch over her left eye steps out carrying the
nurses tray with the goodbye forever filled syringe on it
she walks down the corridor towards the sleeping brides room
member of the deadly viper assassination squad codename the bride alone in her bed alone in her coma alone in her room
elle driver opens the door to her room and steps inside
the female assassin approaches the comatose woman
looking down at her sleeping target victim rival and opposite number
ex cu the brides eyes wide open blank stare
elle standing over the brides hospital bed says to her i might never of liked you
point in fact i despise you
but that doesnt suggest i dont respect you
you were a master of a profession thats most difficult to master
dying in our sleep is a luxury our kind is rarely afforded
my gift to you
as she lifts the syringe off the tray
her cell phone rings
she curses to herself
there can be only one person on the other end
she answers it
pause im standing over her right now
the female assassin turns away from the wide eyed stare of the bride and paces the hospital room talking in the cell phone
dont fuckin ssshhh me
if you think i came all the way down to texas in a dog and cat rainstorm no less just to tuck sleeping beauty in bed you got another fuckin
thing comin pause then real loud you dont owe her shit
then again but quieter you dont owe her shit
pause man fuck that bitch
pause oh youre not are you
well bill you never leave a job half done
a great teacher taught me that once he looked a whole lot like you
elle pauses as bill on the other line has his say
we dont hear his side we stay with elle as he talks
we can tell by her face hes making some sense
after awhile she answers back i guess
pause no i dont need to guess i know
pause i love you too bye bye
the female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at the comatose bride with the open eyes
even though her face is expressionless she almost seems to be smiling
thought that was pretty funny didnt ya
word of advice shithead dont you ever wake up
elle leans closer to the brides face
ya know now i get a better look at you youre not so damn pretty
yeah you go that venus thing going for you but
ya know now i get a closer look at you youre kinda weird looking
you got this big nose that doesnt fit with the rest of your face your eyes are two different sizes
and look at your skin
my complexion is way better than yours the bride does one of her motor reflex functions
she spits in elles face
elle springs up wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down at the comatose bride in her bed
oh no you didnt
she grabs the bride by the front of her hospital gown
yanks her up to a sitting position
and punches her hard in the face three times
if you ever take your ass out of this goddamn bed for as long as you fuckin live i will beat you into the ground bitch
elle driver in her nurses uniform angrily walks down the hallway
she passes by a doctor struggling with a patient bleeding profusely on a gurney
yelling nurse come here quick were losing this man
elle doesnt even look back
tough titty i quit
she walks out of the shot
five years later
the camera is in a corner of the ceiling looking down on the comatose bride who lies motionless in her bed
we hear the sound of a buzzing mosquito doing loop de loops and figure eights in the air looking for some warm blood
the buzzing stops
of mosquito on the brides forearm its stinger dug in her flesh visibly drawing blood from its host
drinking her blood
when the brides hand comes into frame and squashes the bug flat
her fingers flick the dead bug away
cu the bride her wide open eyes that have stared in a constant gaze for the last five years finally
they suddenly pop open
the bride sits bold upright in bed
she has no idea where the fuck she is
we do a shaw brothers back at the wedding chapel gun pointed down at our face
quick cut back to the bride in her hospital bed bank still echoing in her ears
she lets out a scream of pain and her hand goes to the side of her head as if she were just shot
her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her skull where the hole was
she knocks against it with her knuckle
suddenly she says out loud my baby
her hand goes down to her belly unly to find it not swollen but flat
she doesnt understand lifts up her hospital gown and sees a jagged scar which runs down her abdomen
her fingertips trace it
she quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the lines
macro cu the lines in her palm look like a road map
she stops counting shocked to herself five years
she counts again
a statement five years
the brides two eyes fill with tears as she realizes her baby is long gone
she hears the step
of bills boots walking balloon by her head
inside of it we see bills black boots walking across the wood floor of the wedding chapel
we see a hospital orderlys bright red and white reeboks softly slapping against the smooth surface of the institutions floor
they make a sound nothing like bills shoes
the bride listening to them orderlys reeboks walking getting closer
we hear the down the hospital step
in time corridor
with orderlys sneakers
orderlys face leading two truckdrivers
the bride hears bills in time in time shes right in here
shes right in here
stay with the brides screen the bride decides the best course of action till she gets her bearings is to play possum
she throws herself back down on the bed just as the three men enter her room
they see just what they expected to see the bride lying in her bed in her coma
she duplicates her comatose eyes wide open fixed stare
except knowing shes awake and sees everything in front of her creates a slightly different effect
the bride however while she sees the two truckdrivers for what they are when she sees the orderly she sees bill when the orderly talks she hears bill
we however will never see the orderly takes her shee covering off and hitches up her hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed
he does kind of a ta da presentation of her vagina
now is that the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw or is that the cutest little blonde pussy you evea saw
trucker gerald would tend to agree trucker warren fronts

cu the bride eyes wide open playing possum
she cant believe shes being exhibited in this manner
a look of chagrin crosses her trying to be expressionless face ive seen a fuck load better than you fatass
yeah in a movie maybe
but i know damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to
the price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen you gittin your freak on or what
the truckers pay the bill of fare

but after that its allll goooood
her plummin down there dont work no more so feel free to cum in er all ya wont

the orderly turns to leave then remembers something and turns back
he takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline in the history of cinema and hands it to warren
oh by the way not all the time but sometimes this cunts cunt can get drier than a bucket of sand
if she dry lube up with this and youll be goo to go
bon appetit gentlemen
and with that the orderlys gone
the brides pov as soon as he leaves the two truckers start giggling
warren begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly
while he looks down to accomplish this the brides pov hey warren she just blinked
he said she cant blink
i know what he said im tellin ya she just did
warren drops his levis to his ankles
just wait when i get through with this little dumbbell she gonna stand up and recite the gettysburg ad dress
warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount the bride
before he does he stops and looks back to gerald
this shit aint no peep show
go out in the hall and ill let ya know when its your turn
awww cmon i gotta leave the room
i cant get no errection wit you lookin at me so go on
well just hurry up then
gerald leaves the room we go out with him in the hallway
gerald paces waiting for his turn behind the door
he hears behind the door a commotion then warren scream like a bitch
he bangs on the closed door and says he man keep it down in there i can hear your ass out here
more falsetto screams behind the door
the heavy thud of a body falling
not what the expected
gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight
his buddy bloody and lying motionless on the floor and the bride lying haphazardly on the bed in her coma
he moves to his buddy whos dead
then moves to the comatose bride
who suddenly springs to life grabbing him by the front of his shirt yanking him down to her and plunging the i
needle in her arm deep into his temple then twisting it around and around turning the right side of his brain into scrambled eggs a la the bride
she tosses the now brain dead gerald to the floor
the bride upon waking without leaving the bed where she lay the last five years has just killed two men
she throws off the bloody blankets whips her legs off the side of the bed and tries to stand then quickly falls out of frame
we hear the the bride is flat on the floor
her legs and feet dont work
which means shes stuck on the floor with only a functioning top half and a completely useless bottom half
whats a girl to do
the elevator doors open and the orderly steps out
back to the bride she hears the sound of bills boots approaching the room
she sees gerald has a truckers knife in a holster attached to his belt
her hands removes it
the orderly swaggers down the hall to the brides room red reeboks slapping against the smooth floor
cu the bride she snaps the knifes blade open in her cu
the orderly pushes open the brides door stopping in shock
the orderlys pov he sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it two dead truckers on the floor and no bride
we go to slow motion as he freaks then pan down him
past shirts pants to his reeboks
once on the floor we see the bride curled up low next to the doorway behind his ankles knife ready
we go back to frames a second
he steps into the room when he does the bride reaches out and slashes both of his achilles tendons
the standing orderly lets out a yelp adn falls out of frame
the orderly hitting the floor face first
the boy is stunned
the bride confined to the floor crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor placing his melon head between the door and the door frame
then taking the door in her right hand
the orderly lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness
hes in both excruciating pain and quite sure hes lost his mind since at this moment hes lying on the floor looking up at the comatose bride asking him questions
hurt and confused who
where is bill
i dunno no bill
i saw him here myself
now do you tell me where he is or do i beat your fuckin brains in
please please stop dont hit me again
where is bill
suddenly the bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck that she thought shed seen earlier on bill
she snatches it from around his neck
where did you get this from
i saw bill wearing it in this room ten minutes ago
then the bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the orderlys hand one spelling b
on each finger of his left hand
and another spelling f
on the fingers of his right
the bride seems to look inside her own mind whenever she does this a special theme music will play well call it her we see buck enter her room that
first night five years ago
hes holding in his hand one of those big flashlights you use in a tent when camping
it gives off a soft blue light
buck examines the bride through the blue
well aint you the slice of cutie pie they all said you wuz
well maam im from longview texas my names buck and im here to fuck
he starts to unbuckle his belt
we zoom out of her eyes into a cu
the remembering theme cuts off
she looks down at buck and says your names buck right
and you came to fuck right
a how the fuck does she know look crosses his face
the bride looks down at him
the vengeance theme begins playing loudly on the soundtrack and the vein in her forehead becomes pronounced and begins to pulsate in time with the music
every time the bride comes face to face with a tormenter this theme will play on the soundtrack
by mid movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic anticipation of the carnage to come
and with the door in her hand and one mighty slam this longview texas boy is sent to the promised land
she searches the dead mans pockets coming up with a brown wallet that says on it big el paso pimpin loaded with lettuce
she also pulls out a set of car keys on a pickup truck key chain that has the words pussy wagon on it written in a pimpy font
she gathers up all these items and geralds knife then begins to strip buck of his orderly uniform
the elevator doors to the hospitals underground parking lot open revealing the bride in bucks orderly scrubs in a wheelchair
she wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot
her arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars looking for a pickup truck that buck would own
what made the bride stop
the ass end of a big yellow x hard body pickup truck with flames painted along the side and the words pussy wagon written along the flat bed hatch door
the bride looks at bucks key chain in her hand
ex cu car key in truck door lock it turns
the bride pulls herself up into the backseat of bucks pickup truck
once in the backseat she shoves the wheelchair away
it rolls out of control down the parking ramp and crashes
now the brides lying vertically in bucks trucks backseat
seemingly out of danger at least out of sight but shes still stuck hiding in the hospital
and until she regains full use of her legs and feet this little bride aint goin anywhere or doin anything
lying flat with the back of her head propped up against the door her long lifeless legs stretched out in front of her her two bare feet at the end
of them pointing to the sky the bride focusses her eyes her stare her thoughts her strength and all her concentration
on her big toe
monotone wiggle your big toe
toe doesnt move an inch
wiggle your big toe
it doesnt move
wiggle your big toe
as i lay in the back of bucks pickup truck trying to will my limbs out of entropy i could see the faces of the cunts who did this to
me and the dick responsible
members all of bills brainchild the deadly viper assassination squad

it ends with the reappearance of the six heades snake logo and the six black silhouettes
the final credit appears created and produced by we move into a head and shoulders cu of the brides black now after five years of beauty sleep i knew absolutely
nothing about my enemies strengths weakness or whereabouts
but as fated by god vengeance would have it i who knew nothing knew one thing
as sure as god made little green apples
we move fast to o ren ishiis silhouette the silhouette becomes a posed picture of o ren in all her deadly viper glory
continued if o ren ishii the first name on my death list was still alive
shed live in japan
o ren ishii made her first acquaintance with death at the age of eleven
cu o ren years old hiding under a bed watching
her father dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the american army fighting three yakuza gangsters
he kills one with his bare hands
the other two slice him to death with samurai swords
and her mother being raped by the same men
when they finish they shoot her
little o ren watches hidden from sight withi the eyes and face of a stone
it was at that age a half chinese half japanese american army brat witnessed the murder of her master sergeant father
and the rape then murder of her mother at the hands of japans most ruthless yakuza boss boss matsumoto
she swore revenge
luckily for her boss matsumoto was a pedophile
a stream of red blood shoots up out of him like a geyser
boss is naked o ren wears a japanese schoolgirl uniform
at thirteen she got her revenge
the bosss screams cause two of bosss men to run into the room only to be shot down by o ren as she removes a gun from a holster strapped
to her thigh
the year old o ren ishii on a rooftop with a high powered scope sight rifle up to her eye
her eye is hugely magnified in the scope
by twenty she was one of the tip top of female assassins in the world
a central american general riding backseat of his government vehicle
two beautiful latin women in one piece bathing suits sit on either side of him
they both wear sashes down their front one reads miss panama the other reads miss venezuela
as we cut to this shot he has both hands on each of their bare knees
hes laughing as the top of his head is the year old o ren ishii stands before bill and the bride
bill is not clearly viewed
at twenty three she joined bills deadly vipers
the year old o ren ishii beating up the pregnant bride with the other vipers
at twenty five she did her part in the killing of eight innocent people including my unborn daughter in a small wedding chapel in el paso texas
but on that day five years ago she made one big mistake
posed figure of the bride in all her pre beating bridal gown glory
she should of killed nine
however before statisfaction would be mine first things first
cu the bride in bucks truck an hour and a half later from the last time we saw her
wiggel your big toe
cu the brides big toe wiggles slightly
hart parts over
now lets get these other piggies wiggling
thirteen hours later pavement of the parking lot
we hear a car door open offscreen then the brides bare foot comes from above frame stepping down into the shot
she walks around to the drivers side and climbs in
she sticks bucks ignition key in its slot and turns
the trucks engine rumbles to life
she spies a pair of elvis t
sunglasses lying on the dash
she puts them on
the bride drives bucks big yellow pussy wagon all over el paso buying supplies
we follow her bare feet into a clothing store
her feet legs and ass slip into a new pair of levis
her hands grab a pair of cherry brown cowboy boots
then slips on the cowboy boots
chooses another top
and finds a warm jacket
she opens bucks big el paso pimpin wallet and pays for the items
she emerges from the store wearing her new outfit and climbs back in the truck
she drives stopping at a department store and walking inside
she picks up a shovel a hand pickaxe a big camping flashlight a map of texas a writing notebook and a bunch of red and black felt pens
while the bride is buying items in the department store well with her driving the pussy wagon up to a low rent motel called the texican
her registering with the old bastard of a desk clerk getting the key and paying him out of the big el paso pimpin wallet
her drawing a bath in the bathroom of the motel room
shampoo is taken off the shelf of the department store
a bar of soap
hot water runs out of the bathtub faucet
steam rises off the hot bathwater
she pulls down a bunch of bath products like bubble bath salts apricot this kiwi that we see her pour all the items in the bathwater
then we see her bare foot enter the bathwater
then lower her whole body into the bathwater
now submerged in the warm bathwater by herself perfect music cue on soundtrack she begins to cry
her poor heart has been shattered and five years of tears come flooding out of her
she cries for her baby
she cries for the motherhood robbed from her
she cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her path
she cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover
she cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades
she cries for the five years of life snatched from her
she cries for the countless violations she endured while incapacitated
and finally she cries for all the misery she will cause the undeserving
enroute to bills retribution
retribution that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub
she curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm water
we dolly back
to give our heroine some privacy
we dissolve through the bathroom door
till were on the other side filming a closed door with crying on the other side
when shes finished shedding tears is when shell begin shedding blood
when the bathroom door opens the woman that emerges has closed out all of her emotions
save from one
its that woman in her new outfit that climbs into the yellow pussy wagon puts the t
sunglasses over her eyes and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to follow
the truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of prairie wasteland
we see dirt rocks plants and an oil derrick pumping up and down
the bride stops the truck
taking her flashlight with her the bride walks into the headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular
she lifts it off the ground theres an x on its underside
if the x hadnt been there she would have taken it as a sign that her vengeance quest was never meant to be
but as it is there it would appear that fortune has smiled on the bride and her bloody intentions
she walks back to the truck takes the shovel and the hand pickaxe out from the flatbed reaches into the truck cab and cu the brides cowboy boots next to
the x rock in time with the metal the brides cowboy boots count out ten paces from the rock
when the boots stop the flashlight enters the shot illuminating the spot then
the shovel enters striking deep in the unmarked earth
deep in the middle of fuck knows texas lit by the headlights of bucks x the bride digs a hole in the ground
she hits something hard
she gets down on her knees hacking away at the dirt with the hand pickaxe till a large box covered in plastic is revealed
she hoists it up out of the earth
she rips off the plastic revealing a large green army footlocker untouched by the condensation of being buried in the ground for over five years
flipping the two locks open she lifts the lid placing the big camping flashlight on the rim
unfolding a sleeping bag long ways she bought at the department store
the bride begins collecting the contents of her buried treasure and laying them on the sleeping bag
we see her remove them from the footlocker one by one
the heavy metal continues on the soundtrack
mm automatics w ammo and holsters
small hand gun w ammo and holster which fits around the thigh
w ankle holster
double edged sog knife w holster mossberg pump action shot gun w ammo silver steel boomerang w a double sided razors edge w holster
old fashioned straight razor she flips it open and inside broken down into four separate pieces is a high powered scope sight rifle
she reaches in and pulls out a photocopy of her sonogram
there on the page is a photocopy of her unborn baby girl
a fierce grimness crosses her face as she places the sonogram back in the envelope
clear zip lock bag containing a phony i
and bank book both w the name candy ralston on them
reaching back in the locker she pulls out the final item small key attached to a dealy vipers key chain
she rolls up the weapons in the sleeping bag and drives off
the heavy metal continues
cu sign reading commonwealth bank of texas cu the bride standing at a teller window she holds up her key
insert bank book and drivers license w the brides photo on it and the name candy ralston on each
the bride with a big athletic bag slung over her shoulder watches a teller remove four safety deposit boxes
where you look isnide your safety deposit box by yourself
the bride opens up the first box
its filled w cash
she opens up the second box
its filled w cash
she opens up the third box
its filled w cash
she opens up the fourth box
she takes out a bag
inside the bag are forged passports and drivers licenses in different names
also in the box is one compact refrigerator case
she opens it inside are beautiful handmade gold syringes and vial of bills own concoction
he calls it the undisputed truth
as the heavy metal continues
we see the bride leaving the bank all the weapons she needs all the money she needs taking the first step on her bloody trail
the tiny figure of a black airplane flies over the map leaving a dotted line trail behind it
we move into the black airplane and dissolve to of the bride in her passenger seat flying to japan
we see shes holding a clean white handkerchief
shes sewing the name bill in the corner
chapter three the man from the entrance to a tiny sushi bar covered by a japanese curtain
the city of the fabric is moved aside and the bride enters the shot and the tiny establishment
the little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word cozy
besides the bride the only other person inside is the sushi chef who smiles at her behind the midget bar
this japanese man in his mid fifties greets the tall blonde western girl with a turned on for the tourists affability
my english very good
the bride smiles at this and walks further inside
she doesnt come across as one of the worlds deadliest assassins but instead as a sweet slightly airheaded american tourist
the sushi chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise and says oh domo very good very good you speak japanese
nooo just a few words i learned since yesterday
may i sit at the bar
sure sure sure sit
what other words did you learn excuse me the sushi chef yells in japanese to someone offscreen
the bride thinks the restaurant so small its almost hard to imagine there could be a back room to it
before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling to a moment ago the sushi chef turns back to the bride
what other japanese you learn
the bride puts on a thinking face
you know what ah so means i see
i see very good
i already said domo right
kon netie wa
the sushi chef goes oooh like hes just discovered the answer to a mystery
kon nichi wa
kon nichi wa
saying with surprise and admiration most impressive
you say japanese words like you japanese
the bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle
now youre making fun of me
no no no serious business
pronunciation very good
you say arigato
like we say arigato
well thank you i mean
you should learn japanese very easy
no kidding i heard its kinda hard
whenever the sushi chef doesnt either hear your or understand you he yells the word what
and everybody always speaks louder and clearer immediately afterwards
i always heard it was difficult
yes yes yes most difficult
but you have japanese tongue
maybe i was japanese in another life
the sushi chef proclaims as if he should know most definitely most definitely japanese in another life
he sets an order of colorful raw fish in front of the young blonde woman that not only looks good it looks beautiful
how did you know tunas my favorite
tunas my favorite
ah thank you very much
he yells offscreen in japanese agai
a little bald japanese man with a shitty attitude comes out from the back room
he heads for the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in japanese what she wants to drink
to the bald man i beg your pardon
the sushi chef pantomimes drinking
drink oh yes a bottle of warm sake
ahhh sake he holds up his thumb very good
in japanese he yells orders the warm sake the little bald man disappears
the bride takes a bite out of her fish
first time in japan
yes this is my first time
as the chef slices the next portion with a large knife he asks what brings you to okinawa
i came to see a man
aaahh you have friend live in okinawa
ive never met him
the sushi chef continues slicing
who is he may i ask
theres a break in the sushi chefs slicing
after a beat he brings a bloody finger into frame and sticks it in his mouth
the little bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake he pours one for the bride then disappears again
as the bride sips the sake she looks at the chef
as the sushi chef sucks his finger he looks at the bride
the sushi chef drops the voice he had been using up to that point
and in japanese subtitled in english asks what do you want with hattori hanzo
the bride answers in japanese i need japanese steel
why do you need japanese steel
i have vermin to kill
you must have big rats you need hattori hanzo steel
the trap door in the floor opens up and hattori hanzo sushi chef climbs inside the room followed by the bride
the room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand carved wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of the second half of the attic
the bride walks down the row of japanese steel looking and touching the shiny wood
she looks behind her to hanzo who is still by the trap door and says may i
the sushi chef answers in english yes you may
she starts reaching for one
try the second one down in the sixth row on your left
she finds it lying sleeping in its shiny black sheath
her hand lifts it from the rack
she unsheaths the steel partially
then with great flourish
hanzos mouth froms a smile
funny you like samurai swords
he pulls a baseball out of his pocket
i like baseball
then suddenly he throws the baseball hard right at the brides head
the two perfectly cut baseball pieces hit the floor
he gives her a slight nod then crosses the attic towards her
i wanted to show you these
however someone as you who knows so much must surely know i no longer make instruments of death
i keep these here for their ascetic and sentimental value
he takes both sword and sheath from her
yet proud tho i am of my lifes work
he closes them together i am retired
then give me one of these
these are not for sale
i didnt say sell me
i said give me
and why should i be obliged to assist you in the extermination of your vermin
because my vermin is a former student of yours
and considering the student id say you had a rather large obligation
hattori hanzo goes to a dusty window and writes the name bill on it with his finger
the blonde girl nods her head yes
the proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor throwing it open
he points into a corner
you can sleep there
starts to descend
it will take me a week to make the sword
before his head disappears he says i suggest you spend it practicing
he closes the door behind him
she smiles slightly
then moves over to the window takes out a handkerchief and wipes bills name off
one week later under black we hear hattori hanzos voice in japanese and read the subtitles im done doing what i swore an oath to god years ago to never
ive created something that kills people
and in that purpose i was a success
ive done this because philosophically im sympathetic to your aim
ex cu the hanzo sword tracking ex cu of the hanzo sword in its shiny black wood sheath
at the base of the sheath by the handle hes carved the face of a lioness
i can tell you with no ego this is my finest sword
if on your journey you should encounter god god will be cut
revenge is never a straight line
its a forest
and like a forest its easy to lose your way
to get lost
to forget where you came in
to serve as a compass a combat philosophy must be adopted that can be found in the secret doctrine of the yagu ninja
and now my yellow haired warrior repeat after me we go back and forth between cu of hanzo reciting the doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the bride repeating
when engaged in combat the vanquishing of thine enemy can be the warriors only concern
the bride repeats this
this is the first and cardinal rule of combat
the bride repeats this
suppress all human emotion and compassion
the bride repeats this
kill whoever stands in thy way even if that be lord god or buddha himself
the bride repeats this
this truth lies at the heart of the art of combat
once it is mastered
thou shall fear no one
though the devil himself may bar thy way
the bride repeats this
her eyes look at the greatest maker of swords on this earth and says domo
ex cu the hanzo sword her white hand with her long fingers comes into frame and removes the beautiful artful instrument of vengeance
chapter four at a hand comes in and as the bride talks over this image draws with a piece of charcoal a portrait of the geisha regaled o ren ishii
when fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge at the time it seems proof like no other that not only does god exist youre doing his will
at a time when i knew the last about my enemies the first name on my death list was the easiest to find
but of course when one manages the difficult task of becoming queen of the tokyo underworld one doesnt keep it a secret does one
the charcoal drawing gets color and becomes animated turning into a japamation o ren
we see japamation style images of the brides verbiage
at the age of twenty bill backed his nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her shakespearian in magnitude power struggle with the other yakuza clans over who would rule vice
in the city of tokyo
japamation images of o ren and her army taking on another yakuza army among falling cherry blossoms
we cut back and forth between cartoon images of this and the real life real mccoy samurai sword battle
o rens ability is simply amazing
when it was all over it was the geisha regaled o ren ishii that proved the victor
o ren has just become the official leader of crime in the city of tokyo
the six yakuza clan bosses each with two bodyguards standing behind them toast their new leader with much laughter and drinking
all except one
and just in case youre wondering how could a half breed japanese chinese american become the boss of all criminal activity in tokyo japan
ill tell you
the subject of o rens blood and nationality came up before the council only once
the night o ren assumed power over the crime council
boss tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the alcohol fueled frivolity
the man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is boss tanaka
and what boss tanaka thinks is
boss tanaka brings his fist down on the table smashing the plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces
the party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the tanaka crime family
whats the meaning of this outburst
this is a time for celebration
and what exactly should i be celebrating
the perversion of our illustrious council
the bosses all react with shock and outrage
o ren remains cool
she raises her voice for the first word but lowers it for the rest of the sentence
boss tanaka obviously has something on his mind
allow him to express it
looking at a clan head along with yours and
looking at another along with yours started this council
and while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today
the bosses react again
o ren silence
then composed of what perversion do you speak tanaka
boss tanaka looks at the female half breed american and says i speak mistress ishii
of the perversion done to this council which i love more than my own children
by making a half chinese american its leader
faster than you can say jimminy cricket
o rens samurai sword is unsheathed
boss tanakas head is liberated from its body
the head hits the floor
and from the spot between its shoulder blades a geyser of blood shoots up in the air
the bosses who were shocked at tanakas words are even more flabbergasted at o rens resonse
the two bodyguards standing behind boss tanaka hands go to their swords and draw them
o ren turns her blade in their direction
the bosses and their bodyguards say nothing
the lady looks across at the two men and says in and authoritative voice fight me or work for me
they look at her for a moment then they lower their swords
drop them on the ground
get behind me
get on your knees
put your foreheads on the floor
keep your mouths shut
you better believe they do
the mistress eyes got to the other bosses looking at her
as she speaks english bodyguard translators translate for their bosses
im going to say this in english so you know how serious i am
as your leader i encourage you to from time to time and always in a respectful manner and with the complete knowledge that my decision is final to question my
if youre unconvinced a particular plan of action ive decided is the wisest tell me so
but allow me to convince you
and i will promise you right here and now no subject will be taboo
except the subject that was just under discussion
to a bodyguard hand me that head
he picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the queen
she takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks
the price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or my american heritage as a negative is i collect your fuckin head
now completely american just like this fucker here
now if any of you sonsabitches got anything else to say nows the fuckin time
nobody says anything
i didnt think so
pause meeting adjourned
the entire o ren ishii crew moves through the restaurant
the customers all look up now as the crew passes
the restaurant staff acts as if the shogun himself has just showed up on their doorstep demanding a meal
no doubt if the meal is not satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger
the door to a private dining room is slid open the crew steps inside the door is slid shut
the private dining area of the japanese restaurant
the patrons are surrounded by white paper walls
the camera circles around o ren ishii
sitting in between her two personal bodyguards the yubari sisters yuki and go go
the yubari sisters are younger than o ren yuki is sixteen and go go is seventeen
both girls are dressed in japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid skirts and matching blazers
ex cu of an eyeball the brides on her right is her french and japanese lawyer sofie fatale
the bunch of mop topped young men who all wear black suits white shirts thin black ties and kato masks over their eyes are her soldiers the crazy
ex cu of an ear the brides fingers come into frame and move blonde hair out of the sensory appendages way
and finally theres a tall dark american in a black suit sans kato mask thats o rens head of security mr
theyre all drinking and having a good time as sofie tells a joke in japanese
the mop tops in black suits and kato masks were o rens soldiers the crazy
the two young girls in the schoolgirl uniforms are her personal bodyguards the yubari sisters
yuki aged sixteen and go go aged seventeen
the pretty lady whos dressed like shes a villain on star trek is o rens best friend and her lawyer sofie fatale
and finally the american in the black suit but sans kato mask o rens head of security mr
suddenly o ren hears something
like a deer in the forest her head springs up on alert
its almost as if shes listening to the brides narration
the brides narration suddenly stops in midsentence o ren removes a small dagger dart from the folds of her robe and throws it in the direction of the sound
cu the bride dressed in a kimono on the other side of the private dining rooms paper wall
the dart flies through the paper streaks by her face almost taking off the tip of her nose in the process
o rens action instantly brings the rooms frivolity to a halt
mistress ishii silently orders go go and yuki to retrieve the eavesdropper
the white paper door to o rens dining room slams open
yuki and go go step into the corridor
all trace of the bride has vanished
they look out over the restaurant patrons look normal
whoever was there is gone now
go go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the yubari sisters go back into the private dining room slamming the door behind them
cu the bride at the bar in her kimono drinking a colorful cocktail
she observes all the activity by o rens private dining room
when the yubari sisters go back inside the bride climbs off her barstool and goes through the restaurant
into the parking area
and up to her rental car
she opens the door
takes off her japanese kimono underneath is a one piece yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides like the one bruce lee wears in game of
she tosses the kimono in the trunk then removes the sheathed hanzo sword
with the sword of vengeance in her hand we follow her back inside the restaurant
she looks upstairs to the o ren dining room
we see yuki yubari and sofie fatale slide open the door and walk down the stairs together
when they get to the bottom they give each other a kiss goodbye and yuki leaves the restaurant while sofie makes her way to the bathroom
only to have the bride now dressed in her bruce lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand bar her way
between cus of the two women face to face
to bride can i help you
yes i am looking for the attorney of o ren ishii sofie fatale
would that be you
im mistress ishiis attorney
how can i help you
the bride punches her in the face
aside from drinking like fishes what is the queen of the tokyo underworld mistress o ren ishii and her private army doing when we cut back
singing karaoke of course
its crazy mikis turn at the mike and hes having a whale of a good time singing dionne warwicks walk on by in japanese
a commotion is heard being made by the restaurant staff and the other patrons from the other side of the white paper wall
just as they all start to notice it they hear o ren ishii
you and i have unfinished business
the crazy spring to their feet
one slides open the door
they see o rens lawyer sofie fatale standing in the middle of the restaurant her left arm completely outstretched hand gripped around a post
she has a terrified look on her face
before anybody on o rens side of the room can say anything the bride steps out from behind sofie
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned out to be
she says the brides name softly to herself its the bride the vengeance theme bursts on the soundtrack
the vein on her forehead begins to pulsate
we do a quick shaw brothers zoom into her eyes
a spaghetti western flashback of o ren beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel is superimposed over her eyes
the flashback dissolves we zoom back into a cu the vein stops pulsating and the theme stops playing over the soundtrack leaving a clean colorful cu of the bride loaded
she raises her hanzo sword and slices off sofies arm at the shoulder with one stroke
spewing and gushing blood from her stump twists her body in agony painting the floor and the walls with giant splashes of red as her body hits the floor twitching
in both surprise and shock
the crazy run out into the dining area and create a human wall between themselves and their mistress
take positions on either side of o ren
seated in a shoguns seat rises furiously to her feet
the bride does a swipe in the air with her sword sofies blood flies off the blade
the entire floor of the dining room lies between the two warring parties
the bride vs
the crazy the restaurants staff and patrons sit or stand rigidly in fear
o ren says loudly to the room sorry everybody but im afraid were going to have to close the place
theres some private business that we must attend to now
the staff and the customers stampede the exits
the bride the crazy and o ren hold their ground without moving a muscle till the dining room as well as the entire restaurant known as the house of blue
leaves is deserted of every human not engaged in the face off that precedes combat
o ren gives a simple order miki
miki one of the crazy the little one steps forward unsheaths his sword and yells at the yellow clad blonde
you had it coming bastard
raising his samurai sword high he charges screaming a banzai scream
the bride turns to face him
miki charging and screaming
the bride slowly raises the hanzo sword into striking position
miki charging and screaming almost on top of her
the bride sword in position waits for her opponent to arrive
miki arrives at his destination he swings
the bride swings
the hanzo sword slices mikis inferior blade in half
miki looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand
the bride thrusts her sword through mikis abdomen then lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air
miki screaming impaled on her blade like a fish at the end of a spear
held up in the air restaurant light fixtures in the b
o ren and her crew watch stunned
the bride drops the shishkabobbed miki into the koi pond that starts outside the restaurant and ends inside with a huge blue splash
koi pond blue water orange and yellow fish red blood dead man
the bride looks up from the pond across the length of the floor into the eyes of o ren ishii
she takes one step forward hears the slightest noise twirls the samurai sword in the air once drops to one knee and thrusts the sword into the beige colored carpet
the sword sticks in the floor half way
the sound of human death rises from underneath the floor
looking down on the bride at one end and o ren and her crew at the other
a red circle appears where the blade is buried in the floor
the red circle grows larger
and larger still
leaving the sword stuck in the floor handle sticking straight up in the air the bride rises up from her one knee and straight and tall staring down the queen
of the tokyo underworld
o ren her eyes narrow with rage
she screams out another order tear the bitch apart
the six remaining crazy unsheath their swords at the same time with a great sound effect
they circle the bride
the bride inside the circle of combatants who surrounded her
she whips the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in front of her
her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel
holding her sword in the diagonal position the bride can see reflected in the shiny blade whoever stands behind her
the six crazy attack
the bride does a zatoichi like swish slash swish with her steel blade
four boys die an immediate samurai blade inflicted death the last two put up more of a fight
but then one of them is slashed and falls and the last one is slashed and crashes through the restaurants big picture window
ex cu the eyes of the bride pointed down at the bodies by her feet they look back up at o ren
standing in between go go and mr
her eyes narrow
the bride swipes the air with her sword the blood of the dead attackers flies off
go go and mr
barrel unsheath their swords
we hear a loud sound of many engines behind the bride
then behind her through the broken pictures window we see seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot
all the riders wear black suits with kato masks and all carry samurai swords
the bride looks from the reinforcements to o ren
to the bride you didnt think it was going to be that easy did you
to o ren you know for a second there yeah i did
o ren smiles
both o ren and the bride finish the phrase together
trix are for kids
this is something they used to say back when they fought alongside of each other as vipers
the seventeen crazy reinforcements come running into the restaurant and with drawn swords surround the bride
as a heavy metal combat beat begins to pulsate on the soundtrack the boys and the bride have a spaghetti western stand off
we do a inside the circle of the crazy who surround the yellow haired warrior
not all have samurai swords one juggles two hatchets another twirls a three staff triple iron over his head
as the heavy metal music builds
we cut to various shots of the two opposing forces preparing to strike
hands on sword handles
feet finding combat stance
until heavy metal reaches its breaking point
at that point the metal explodes over the soundtrack
in time with the bride exploding into a violent killing machine as she matches skill with the army of black suited boys arms flailing silver blade clashing and slashing long
blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish
shes a goddess of war venus
not only is the fight cut to the heavy metal music but the bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights
this explosion of furious violence is punctuated cinematically by the color in the film popping off and the fight being filmed in high contrast black and white turning the squirting
spewing geysers of blood from crimson red to many members of the crazy are sliced slashed and liberated from the limbs they were born with at the brides blade
some specific moments while clashing swords the bride whips the silver boomerang out of its holster and throws it
it twirls through the air
embedding itself longways in one of the boys faces
the bride does a mid air somersault over the head of an attacker landing solid on her feet behind him
slash hes out
the bride is knocked to the floor her attacker stands over her to spear the young blonde her legs spring up in the air ankles lock around the boys neck
she throws him down to the ground
with his neck still in the vise like grip of her ankles she removes the sog knife from its sheath and plunges it deep into the boys chest
while still on the ground an attacker charges at her
yanking the boomerang out of the dead boys face she sends it flying in the charging mans path
boomerang twirling through the air close to the ground
chopping off the charging attackers foot in mid step he falls flat
the bride jumps up onto an attackers shoulders
she locks her legs around him so hes helpless at shaking her off
she swings down with her sword and cuts the mans hands off
so while the helpless man with no hands screams the now nine foot tall bride fights with the others
when shes through she brings the blade across the man shes perched ons throat
he falls to his knees bringing the bride back to the floor like an alevator
as soon as her soles touch ground shes off his shoulders somersaulting on the floor bringing her blade up between an attackers legs into his groin
he lets out a scream as she yanks her blade free
one attacker steps out from the rest the best one
he twirls his sword expertly challenging the young woman to come get a piece
the bride does a screaming charge towards him
sword raised the attacker stands his ground calm steady waiting for the blonde haired locomotive to collide
they match each other blow for blow till one makes a mistake
its the male
the brides swing thats neither clashed or blocked slices off his right arm
the arm still gripping the samurai sword drops to the floor
the bride pushes the hanzo sword right through the middle of his chest
only half of the crazy s that started the fight remain alive or intact
they start to approach
the bride still holding the sword thats still impaling the skilled attacker backs up keeping his body between her and the remaining killers
like a boxer the bride uses the momentary break in the action to rest on her feet
yanks the blade from his chest cavity
the body twitches spasms grunts and crashes to the floor
the attackers start to close in
the bride readies herself for their attack
then in perfect time with the heavy metal
drops to the floor on her back spinning like a top
she swings and slashes and cuts down below at their legs and feet like some hellish samurai sword weilding turtle flipped over on its shell
many black suited mask wearing boys drop to the ground
still spinning like a break dancer she spins up on top of her head and pops back up on her feet
and then there were seven
the seven remaining sword weilding black suited boys moved out of range of the brides blade when she dropped to the floor
now spread out they make a large half circle
the bride slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head
ex cu the brides eyes pointed up watch them move closer color comes back into the film
we see her face is splashed with blood
whips open a red fan
go go stands by the restaurants junction box she flips the switch
the room goes dark
the crazy make a wide circle around the blonde whos still on the floor
looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows
as she breathes in and out the face of a lioness is superimposed breathe in bride breathe out lioness breathe in bride breathe out lioness
the bride rises to her feet
the crazy move in a circle around the bride she moves in a circle inside of their circle all eight of them move in rhythm with the metal
the heavy metal music builds
to a big finish
then both music and the bride explode
with the lights off the white paper wall the eight killers fight in front of turns a psychedelic bright blue
the snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage
the eight samurais are black silhouettes against the blue backdrop
they begin to combat in a dance of blood steel and death
the bride does a sword weilding dosey doe with all sword weilding partners
she clish clash clish clashes with all of them they seperate stalk each other for a moment to the beat then clish clash clish clash again with the bride killing
or hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each encounter sometimes during the separation the bride crouches down low in repose while the others continue to circle stalk
she strikes again
we cut in closer whenever we need to
finally the last of o rens soldiers falls to the brides sword
standing by the junction box flips a switch turning the lights back on
the electricity shines light on
the bride splashed all over with blood
blood painting the floor walls and ceiling
dead bodies several limbs and horribly wounded men who have yet to die litter the ground
with a big whoosh in the air the blood of o rens subordinates fly off the blonde avengers blade
then saying to the foes who litter the ground
those of you lucky enough to still have your lives
take them with you
but leave the limbs youve lost
they belong to me now
the wounded men crawl out of the restaurant
the yellow haired crimson covered woman looks to the last remaining combatants
barrel go go yubari and o ren ishii
go go steps forward and removes her weapon its not a samurai sword
its a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain
she begins twirling it above her head
each rotation makes a whoosh sound in the air
in a d like effect the metal ball comes right at us
the bride ducks out of the way the heavy ball destroying a large chunk of wood post behind her
go go eyes focused on her enemy
she lets fly
the ball and chains wrap around the blade of the hanzo sword
go go yanks
the hanzo sword flies out of her grip
the bride removes her boomerang and throws it at go go
the boomerang twirls through the air heading right for go go
the young bodyguard swats it out of the air with her ball and chain
she lifts up her chain and the boomerang lies bent on the floor
she looks across at her opponent
she lets fly
it strikes the bride in the chest knocking her on her back
go go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the bride on the floor
the bride rolls out of the way the metal ball punches a hole in an overturned table instead
the weaponless bride wrestles a table leg loose from its purpose
she hops up on a table table leg in hand ready to fight
go go hops up on a table
as they fight they hop from table to table
go go throws her ball and chain
the bride quick as a whip
bats it away with the table leg
go go lets loose with the balls and chain
it wraps around the brides ankle
go go yanks
the brides leg is yanked out from under her she fall crashing through another table
go go jumps on top of the bride attacking her with a samurai short sword
the bride uses the table leg to block it
the women fight fiercely locked in grapple each face ugly with struggle
go go lets her left earlobe get too close to the brides mouth
the bride bites down on it
go go screams as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off and she rolls off the bride
the bride comes at her bringing the table leg whoops upside her head whoop whoop sides her the girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back and delivers a
to the bride from below dropping her to her knees
o ren is up and wraps the chain around the brides neck and begins to strangle
the chain digs into the brides throat
the bride brings the table leg which has a couple of nasty looking nails in it hard against the japanese girls thigh
the nails cut through the plaid school uniform skirt into her flesh
the bride rips out the nails taking some leg meat with them
go go lets out a horrific scream
the bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young girls white tennis shoe
the nails stick in the white shoe becomes stained with red
go go screams letting loose of the chain
falling on the floor
the bride unwraps the chain around her neck and begins breathing air into her lungs
go go tries to escape dragging her fucked up leg with her
the bride rises from the floor and begins twirling go gos weapon above her head
go go fast as she can climbs up the stairs to the second floor
the bride stands at the bottom of the stairs twirling the ball and chain over her head
go go frantically and in great pain climbs the stairs
she gets to the top
the bride lets loose with the ball and chain
it hits the female bodyguard and one half of the yubari sisters smack dab in the back of the head
we see her face as shes delivered a death blow right behind it
we see behind her eyes and features her life and spirit shatter like a teapot
like a discarded rag doll go go yubari tumbles down the staircase landing in a pile at the brides feet
dead before the tumble began
the bride throws the ball and chain to the floor
her eyes go to the last two remaining combatants
barrel and o ren ishii
any more subordinates for me to kill o ren
barrel says one last one
and youre black mamba
our reputations precede us
tell me mr
barrel why dont you wear your kato mask
are you and iconoclast
barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick like from a th century costume ball and holds it over his eyes
i dont like that rubber band
it fucks up my hair
you shouldnt work for her
its not too late to quit
do you have choices
i know exactly how you feel
this has nothing to do with you and i and everything to do with me taking satisfaction from that bitch behind you
and theres absolutely positively no way im going to leave here without taking that satisfaction
barrel you have to stand aside
and that means you must quit right now
yes you can
no i cant
dont say cant there are no cants
yes you can
screams at her
last line of defense what are you waiting for
are you on a date
attack her you fool
oh my god
pause she just called you a fool
she just called you a fool in front of me
not only am i your opponent
im a female fellow countryman
and youre going to risk your life to say nothing of harming me for a woman who refers to you as a fool
is furious and slaps mr
barrel on the shoulder
attack goddamn you
the bride acts like shes embarrassed to witness what she just saw
barrel spins in o rens direction shooting her a look shes never seen from him before
he then looks back to the bride
her eyes are waiting for his
she says with just the slightest hint of plea in her voice ill owe ya one
he looks at her a beat longer
then says as he resheaths his sword the things i do for a pretty face
insert the blade sliding back down into the sheath the handle locks into place with a click
he looks back over his shoulder at his former mistress and says i quit
o ren fries and egg on her head
then with his sheathed sword in his right hand and his left hand in his pants pocket he walks across the carnage strewn room and out the front door
as he walks when hes parallel with the bride he stops and says about that one you owe me
im gonna collect someday you know
ill be disappointed if you dont
he continues walking without a look back
before he exits the restaurant he throws a look in sofies direction whos lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood and says tough luck bout that
he exits the movie
o ren and the bride match eyes
the japanese gal says very funny
pause your instrument is quite impressive
where was it made
whom in okinawa made you this steel
this is hattori hanzo steel
the bride just smiles at her rivals response
o rens composure returns
swords however never get tired
i hope youve saved your energy
if you havent you might not last five minutes
pause have you seen the garden in this establishment
oh you really should
its quite beautiful
o ren moves out of the position shes stood in for the entire battle
she steps on the doormat of a corpse that serves the same purpose of a bottom step and moves over to the white paper wall and slides it open
a white winter wonderland set against a jet black sky
a snow covered japanese garden awaits right outside
snow falls from the sky slightly artificial not phony but operatic theatrical
o ren stands next to the bride in the doorway looking out into the white night
as last looks go you could do worse
the queen of the tokyo underworld steps outside
the bride follows her
as snow falls around them they stand the correct distance from one another
combat music begins playing but not japanese drums spanish flamenco guitar
the bride unsheaths her sword quickly
holding it out in front of her
tip of blade pointed at o ren
swords handle and her fingers wrapped around that handle up by her cheek
her eyes are reflected on the blade
snow falls around her
o ren begins walking forward towards the bride
she raises up her sword still in its sheath in front of her face vertically
then begins slowly unsheathing it
snow falls around her
white socks in wooden clogs walk forward crunching snow underneath them
the bride holding sword
eyes reflected in blade
her yellow sneakers crunching snow underneath them
when her sword is fully unsheathed the japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides sword in one hand wood sheath in the other like a bird
the two women circle each other
they swing clash dance separate
swing o ren leaps in the air does a somersault over the brides head landing behind her opponent
she brings her sword down in a slashing swing
slashing the bride across her back spinning her around
o ren goes in for the kill
the bride meets her blade
the blades clash and lock
the two womens faces come together as the blades become entangled
o ren moves her arm in a counter clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into the brides mouth
knocking her backwards over a small stone bench flat on her ass in a koi pond
the combat guitar stops o ren doesnt charge the fallen blonde she laughs silly caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords
bill might of humored you but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade
now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi stand up and fight
you may not be able to fight like a samurai but you can at least die like a samurai
the combat guitar starts again
as the bride slowly rises out of the koi pond
she brings up her sword and says calmly to o ren in japanese attack me
with everything you have
the two women clash swords furiously their attack ends with the brides striking o ren not fatally but deep
cold air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives
o ren looks down to her wound then back up to the bride
the respect for the brides ability is transparent
the two women circle stalk each other again
red blood running down yellow legs onto yellow sneakers
wooden clogs crunching the snow blood trail dripping down legs staining white socks with red
they attack the geisha figurine and the tall western girl with the mane of whipping blonde hair
they swing twist turn clash matching blow for blow till they both back off
both women are out of breath and have to stop to recuperate
as they both drink the harsh cold air into their lungs leaving red blood stains in the white snow the two females have the same thought
the next clash will be their last
i apologize for ridiculing you earlier
they continue breathing
the flamenco guitar begins again as the two women circle each other for their final attack
with all the quickness and skill at their command they clash in a superb display of samurai swordplay
they find themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall
the bride and o ren both begin running diagonally through the snow swords held up high facing each other continuing to run even after they passed the wall screaming their
samurai hearts out
they both swing
cant tell who got who
a scalp of long black hair flies through the air landing in the white snow
facing away from the bride
sword still in her hand
we see she doesnt have the top of her head on
a touch of her brain is exposed
blood droplets streak her face like raindrops
the queen of the tokyo underworld whos regime has just ended with one swing stares off into space
that really was a hattori hanzo sword
her sword falls from her grip
in the snow by her feet
i always dreamed of owning one
o ren falls to her knees toppling forward
left cheek in the snow just barely alive she says did he make it for you
the last thing she says before she dies he must of liked you
with her cheek resting against the snow her eyes close and shes gone
the bride removes a white handkerchief the one we saw her sewing earlier with bill in the corner and uses it to wipe the blood once belonging to the first
name on her death list off her hanzo steel
is returned back to its sheath
the lions head that hanzo carved into the wood seems pleased
the bride now wearing a yellow faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her head stands framed in a trunk shot
minus an arm lies curled up in the trunk of her mazda xoxo
the bride slams the trunk screen boes black
the mazda driving down the road at supersonic speed
the bride behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet
it looks like an insert from grand prix
the bride lifts up trunk lid we look up at her framed in the trunk shot
helmet on head making her faceless gold deadly viper syringe in her hand
when she speaks it comes out of a voice box at the bottom of the helmet
turning her voice deeper and electronically spooky
the two women speak japanese to each other
ive kept you alive for one reason
being o rens lawyer i take it youre familiar with bill
in fact id guesstimate you worked for bill before o ren and thats how it is you came to work for o ren
am i correct
i thought so
give me the arm you have left
i want information
now gimme your arm
sofie offers up her remaining arm
she injects sofie with the gold syringe
the cocktail racing through your bloodstream at this moment is bills own recipe
he calls it the undisputed truth
sofie is injected
okay first things first
where was the other yubari sister
she went home early
whats wrong with her
she has a cold
awwww poor baby

yuki yubari upon hearing the news of her sisters death
shell drink excessively
big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up
shell start trouble
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor
an older japanese man in a business suit sits next to her at the bar
he puts the make on her
do you like ferraris
yuki staring out into space says with a drunken voice ferrari
she slowly turns to face the older japanese man in the business suit
do you find me hot
the man in the business suit giggles at her boldness she gets annoyed dont laugh
do you want to fuck me yes or no
he lets out a grunt coming from below
we see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short sword and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen creating a big red grin across his
yuki focused business suit penetrated
she opens him up more
he feels every inch of the blades progress
how bout now big boy do you still wish to penetrate me
blade cuts deeper
or is it i who has penetrated you
and with her last line does the final disemboweling slice that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor
when she stops shedding tears shell start shedding blood
best guess what will she do
i dont hafta guess shell come after you
will she ever give up
she wont have to
when she finds you i dont know who will win
but what i do know is she will find you
is she more skilled than i
skilled wont be the word

the bride takes this in
then moves on
okay now i want all the information on the deadly vipers
what theyve been doing and where i can find them
the big hospital of tokyo is located by a hill by the highway
sofies mazda pulls off the highway to the side
the bride hops out of the car runs to the back opens the trunk takes out sofies body and rolls it down the hill
sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the huge hospital
in a hospital environment
bills voice speaks to her off sofie sofie my sofie im so sorry
please forgive my betrayal he shhhhs her off screen no more of that
i invented that truth serum
once it entered your bloodstream you no longer had a choice
but still but still nothing except my aching heart over what shes done to my beautiful and brilliant sofie
pause if you had to guess why she left you alive what would be your guess
guessing wont be necessary
she informed me
im allowing you to keep your wicked life for one reason and one reason only

i want him to witness the extent of my mercy
by witnessing your deformed body
i want you to tell him all the information you just told me

cu the bride lies naked on her stomach head up chin resting on her folded hand feeling no pain at the needle piercing her flesh

a black felt pen comes into frame and draws a line through the name

during their face off we only see the bride at a distance
the bride is in the b
back to us packing her trunk just about ready to make a clean getaway
yuki yells to the figure across the street
we see the back turned figure of the bride slightly freeze upon hearing the japanese greeting
without turning around she says conigute wa
thriller music begins on the soundtrack
the bride turns around to face the young avenger
can i help you
you can kill yourself
taking a trip
you still are
i know you feel you must avenge your sister
but i beg you
you call that begging
you can beg better than that
then she takes out a flashlight and switches on the beam

i would like to see for myself
yuki shines the flashlight beam in the brides face
look how pretty your face is
i want to touch it
your face is so pretty i just want to put both of my palms against your cheeks and give you little tiny kisses
yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face
how do i look
youre just saying that cause i told you how pretty you are
yuki youre gorgeous

dont make me kill you
yuki removes the israel sub machine gun from behind her back and fires a loud intense volume of firepower at the bride
the bride dives out of her way just as her yellow pussy wagon is demolished by the ammo
the bride with her samurai sword in her hand and her backpack full of money takes off running across a couple of front lawns
yuki chases her with machine gun fire
the bride leaps over a long hedge
disappearing behind it
yuki runs after her firing all the way destroying the hedge
the bride darts across the street she hits the ground and rolls under a volkswagen van
bullet fire explodes all around the bride as she rolls out on the other side
she removes her mm automatic and returns fire from behind the van
yuki yells to her in english you think youre safe
i say ha
she takes out a hand grenade removes the pin with her teeth and slides it towards the bride
the bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on the asphalt towards her
she takes off running
as the volkswagen van explodes behind she cuts through the backyard of a house the camera taking off with her over their fence in the backyard over the fence into
she trips falling into the other houses swimming pool
instead of splashing around the bride swims like she was in the olympics till shes in the shallow end
without breaking her stride she runs out of the pool
now with her gun out the sopping wet bride gets to the front of the house
its located on a cul de sac
yukis sports car pulls up at the end of the street
both women see the other
yuki hits the gas firing her machine gun out the window of her car as she speeds down the dead end street
the bride runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on the street as the bullets rip up homes lawns and automobiles
when yukis car reaches the end of the dead end
she jerks the wheel
spinning the car around pointing it in the opposite direction
bullets tear up the cars lining the street
in the hail of bullets the bride tries to fire back
yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around
she gets ready to make a third pass
some people in the house behind the bride look out of their front door
the bride yells at them stay in your house and stay down on the floor
yuki speeds after her but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her
the bride runs into the house shes in front of
she runs through the living room to the kitchen and the back door but the kitchens where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door
yukis sports car pulls up in front of the house
she stands up in the convertible
takes out a grenade pulls the pin and says time for the rabbit to come out of her hole
she lobs the grenade up on the porch then throws herself face down on the lawn
the porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters
everybody in the kitchen is blown back
realizing theres no getting out of the back door the bride runs back into the living room thats now missing a wall and runs up the homes staircase leading to
yuki steps into the house sub machine gun in hand
the bride makes it to the top of the stairs and is just about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall
yuki fires up at her hitting her twice in the leg
the upstairs hallway two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway
the bride crashes to the floor screaming blood pours out of her gunshots
yuki charges up the stairs
machine gun blazing tearing up the house
the bride aims her mm where she expects yuki to emerge
yuki gets to the top of the stairs and steps into the hallway
the bride fires
the brides bullet wings yuki in the left breast knocking her through a bedroom doorway
to herself gotcha
yuki screams like a little girl at the pain
she yells from the doorway into the hallway you fucking bitch
you shot me in my breast
theyre not fully developed yet you fucking asshole
now im always gonna have a dimple
the bride answers yuki back with an imitation of yukis giggle which makes the youngin blow her top
piss me off
she fires her machine gun around the corner tearing up everything around the bride
when the young girl stops firing the bride yells yuki in about two minutes theres going to be an army of police here
so if youre gonna kill me nows the time
from her hiding place yuki snorts a line of baby blue powder
it gives her energy
so whats it gonna be bitch
slapping a new clip in her machine gun
that fucking does it
yuki comes around the corner firing her machine gun in the brides direction ripping up everything around her
the bride lying flat on the floor fires her mm
the explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat
yuki charges the bride kamakazi style
three more bullets rip into the bride the bride fires up at yuki hitting her three times in the body knocking her off her feet and sending her tumbling down
the bride shot up pulls herself to the top of the stairs
she sees yuki lying at the bottom dead
yukis face dead eyes closed
then they pop up open
shes not dead
though shes bloody and her schoolgirl uniform is filled with bullet holes she rises
her head turns in the direction of the bride
the bride sees this and cant believe it
they lock eyes
yuki who no longer has the machine gun takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream
she charges up the steps at the bride
the startled bride fires at her
the mms empty
yuki charging up the steps yelling knife raised high
the bride hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster
the bride cocks back the hammer
yuki charging getting closer
the bride fires bullet hits yuki stops her for a quarter of a second but she keeps charging
the bride fires again
yuki jerks but keeps on charging
yuki jerks but keeps charging
yuki jerks keeps chargin almost at her knife raised high
the bride fires yuki jerks but keeps charging knife ready to do its duty
the bride fires but her gun jams
yuki leaps on her with the knife
they struggle for a moment
the bride realizes yukis dead
she tosses her to the side
goddamn what a wildcat
the phone rings and a black woman in a nurses uniform with a name tag on it that reads b
owens answers the phone
cu the bride on her cell phone a business card in her hand with a number written on the back that says b
owens and her phone number
shes bleeding from her five bullet holes
sitting in a pool of her own blood

the bride laid out on nurse owens kitchen table while the nurse extracts the bullets
the bride screams
the tv is turned up loud to hide the screams
the fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three cigarette butts and other balls of lead
the bride drunk as a skunk says to her savior that fuckin smarts
smoking her menthol kool nurse owens says yeah bullets are bad news
in the future you should avoid them if you can
ill keep that in mind
so do i have a future
youll live to kill again
she passes out
chapter six can she bake a cherry pie
is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side
i heard you had a game
who are you
they call me bill
that no one ever calls me
a female voice from off screen says to the doorman open the door alburt lets see what this bill looks like
the door opens revealing bill to the other side of the door and for the first time to the audience
he looks cool
bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into a crap game
a crap table has been erected in the middle of the suite
seven men stand around the table trying their luck
all playing has stopped at the opening of the door
one woman in a beautiful black dress stands at the head of the table
its her game
her name is l
bill stands in the doorway
alburt the doorman who wears a tux waits for l
are you a policeman bill
let him play alburt
bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest
to the players we now return to the game already in progress
the point is nine gentlemen nine is the point
as alburt frisks him bill takes in the room
there are five other men all wearing black tuxedos all carrying samurai swords as is alburt all working for miss oboyle
in his hand bill holds his sheathed hanzo sword
referring to the sword ill take that
youll have to
the two men stare
now now boys
bill do you intend to start any shit with that sword
i give you my word of honor i will start nothing
good enough for me
back to game miss oboyle required a two hundred dollar membership fee
thats rather pricey
you wanna play for free go to vegas
you start now youll be there by sundown
bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull to death
he peels off two hundred
i think ill stay here
bill walks over to the suites bar a young woman tends it
twenty dollars for a beer
high cost of living shooter
you dont like it go to vegas
you can get a prime rib dinner there for
what am i going to do im thirsty
throws a on the bar pour the beer
the bartender produces a dixie cup and a can of budweiser
she pops the top and fills the cup leaving half of the beer inside the can
she then offers only the cup to bill
pointing to the can i dont get that
the bartender slowly shakes her head no
he lifts the dixie cup to his lips and says cheers
bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer
gentlemen lets see if the new kid in school wants to play right away
to bill how bout it new kid you wanna handle my bones or do you just like to watch
dropping his money roll on the table
i came to play
boys take a look at this man hes what websters calls a gambler
the dice belong to you sir
with her table stick she pushes the dice to bill
he takes them and inspects them
i hope youre not implying anything friend
as he inspects dice im not implying anything
alburt starts to move from his position by the door
that did it fuckhead youre out the door l
motions him back to his position
the players watch l
and bill an opposite ends of the table trade quips
bill looks from the dice to l
you looked me over when i stood in your doorway
im looking you over as i step up to your table
if i dont know i dont throw
are you satisfied
more or less
i think were getting into a antagonistic relationship
oh im sorry i thought you were trying to take my money and i was trying to take yours
its just a game
bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table the room reacts
if youre game take my bet sportsman
bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand then throws
the room reacts
smiles and pushes the money and the dice back to bill with her stick
he picks up his winnings tosses them back on the table and says shoot it all
the room reacts
he holds the dice in his fist
the point is five gentlemen five is the point
shoot it all
he shoots again he wins again
moves the money in front of him
bill picks up the stack of moola
stands behind her table stick in her hand eyes on her opponent
in the midst of this silence his beeper goes off
his eyes go to it
it reads elle driver
he raises his eyes from the beeper to l
casually tosses the green on the felt and says shoot it all

you know weve never been properly introduced im l
and im not interested

i could always save myself this horrible fate by not taking your bet
to be replaced by a different fate
the embarrassing truth that you run a gutless game

im sure these gentlemen wont forget it
im sure theyll tell people who wont forget it
and we wont come back
if we dont come back you wont get our money
couple of weeks you wont have a game
you got a big mouth lucky boy
and the idea of taking everything youve won away and sending you out the door with nothing but a red face is so appealing to me that i will take
not with those dice
the houses perogative and you know it
she holds out her palm and two new pair of dice black are placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards
she sets the dice on the table and moves them in front of bill with her stick
bill looks down at them
maybe you would like to change your bet
yes i would
shoot it all
his hand scoops the dice off the table
he catches the young lady by surprise
did i stutter im changing my bet
im betting i dont make it
from the door alburt says you cant do that
oh yes i can
its the shooters perogative and she knows it
the spectators go apeshit
bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady whos game he just busted

bill sits on the bed talking with elle driver on the phone
in the b
is throwing everybody out
games over get out

into phone vernitas dead
pause what about her family
pause nice to see kiddo hasnt gone completely apeshit
no idea where she is
pause okay that did it were going to texas and talk sense into budd before bleep makes him number three
he looks over and l
is sitting on the floor of the bed
all the players have left only l
and her five tuxedo boys remain
were going to have a talk about this later
pause well im not exactly among friends at the moment
he laughs ill keep that in mind bye bye
he hangs up
got a nose problem
i said you could use my phone
i didnt say i wouldnt listen
this is true
you didnt burn me down you know
first rule of any house ya gotta have lucky guy comes in and wipes the place out insurance
if there werent losers it wouldnt be a game
standing up folding his winnings into his inside jacket pocket looking at l
and her boys he says i sincerely hope you mean that
without another word he exits the hotel room
nobody makes a move to stop him
oboyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for the sound of the elevator in the hall
the brides voice comes on the soundtrack what l
oboyle didnt know was the real game was just beginning
bill was on the job and she was the target
now bill was the greatest assassin of the th century
in fact the term hitman was coined for him
and he rarely performs actual assassinations anymore
however every once in awhile to keep his hand in he does
only he plays a game
he doesnt start big trouble
he lets them start it
if they do theyre dead
if they dont not only wont he perform hell take the hit off the market
its kind of fun watching people gamble when they dont know theyre gambling isnt it
they hear the elevator in the hall
oboyle tells her men get my money back
dont kill him
chop off all his fingers
the five men go out the door
the five tuxedo clad bodyguards hit the hallway only to see
bill with his hanzo sword unsheathed standing at the end
this wasnt expected they unsheath their swords
he charges at them
in the hotels hallway bill cuts through the five men
his mastery of the hanzo sword in his hand is peerless
he cuts through the first four rather quickly
the fifth one alburt is the most skilled but he too falls under the masters blade
oboyle hides in her room holding a gun pointed at the front door
she sits in bushwhack mode waiting for bill or anybody for that matter to step through the doorway
the window her back is up against shatters and a black gloved hand reaches inside and grabs her by her hair and yanks her out the window
bill on the ledge of the hotel window the th floor outside l
hes yanked her outside and hes dangling her over the side by her hair
do you know a jessica
is too hysterical to answer
well she knows you
he drops her
bill watches her all the way down
when hes confident her fall was fatal he leaves the ledge
chapter seven the lonely grave of paula schultz a small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle of a barren texas wasteland
a subtitle appears under this image the city of austin texas
a fist knocks on the trailer door
it opens revealing bills brother budd
not the slick willie budd with the black suit and the silver tipped black cowboy boots we saw earlier at the wedding chapel massacre
no the budd we see now is the budd who climbed into a bottle five years ago got himself comfortable and decided to live there
bill looking like a cool million stands out in the dirt and dust of budds lot of land looking up at his brother in his natural habitat
in the b
we can see elle driver lounging in the passengers seat
budd surprised by the visitor says great day in the morning
brother bill livin up to his familia obligation
how ya doin budd
oh you know my life bill just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women
budd squints into the sun at the woman in bills ear
is that that tall blonde one eyed viking bitch in the passenger seat
want to say hello
never said bye cant seem to think of a reason to say hi
elle inside blasting both the stereo and the air conditioner
she watches the brotherly scene play out through the car windshield
obviously theres no love lost between elle and budd
whatd ya wanna talk about
are you not going to invite me in
may i ask why not
it stinks in there thats why
now whats so important it requires a reunion
the estranged brothers continue their conversation
budd sits in the doorway of his trailer bottle of jack in his hand
you tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty eight bodyguards fore she got to o ren
there wasnt really eighty eight of them they just called themselves the crazy
i dunno i guess they thought it sounded cool
anyhow she had about or around her when bleep attacked
they all fell under her hanzo sword
the mention of a hattori hanzo sword gets budds attention
she got er a hattori hanzo sword
bill nods his head yes
she has a hanzo jingi sword
he made her one
didnt he swear a blood oath never to make another sword
it would appear hes broken it
budd doesnt say anything at first
then them japs know how to carry a grudge dont they
or is it just you tend to bring that out in people
pause i know this is a ridiculous question before i ask but you by any chance havent kept up with your swordplay
hell i pawned that years ago
you pawned a hattori hanzo sword
the disrespect is pain
it was priceless
not in el paso it aint
in el pso i got me dollars for it
since it was a gift from me why didnt you offer me the chance to buy it back
because that wouldve required me to acknowledge your existence
drunken bum though i may be i dont need booze that bad
but who the hell gives a crap anyway
that bitch aint gittin no bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword
im a bouncer in a titty bar bill
if she wants to fight me all she gotta do is come down to the club start some shit and well be in a a fight
budd you need to listen to me
i know we havent spoken for quite some time and the last time we spoke wasnt the most pleasant
but you need to get over being mad at me and start becoming afraid of bea
because she is coming and shes coming to kill you
and unless you accept my assistance i have no doubt she will succeed
budd sees bills true concern for his welfare
bill tries to charm his brother
cant we forget the past and look at the happy side of all this
and what would that happy side be
shes brought the boys back together
budd is touched by bills concern and chuckles to himself
i appreciate the concern on your face but theres a difference tween the boys time cant erase
i dont dodge guilt
and i dont jew outta payin my comeuppance
that woman deserves her revenge
and we deserve to die
but then again so does she
so i guess well just see now wont we
the my oh my club is the sleazy titty bar that budd works at
his job is tossin out the riff raff thats worse than him out on their ear minus a few of the teeth they had when they came in
his beat to shit pickup truck pulls up to the front and he climbs out of the automobile
budd walks into the wood paneled titty bar
no strippin goin on yet just a few barflies drinkin
the owner ted yells at him as he walks by
youre late budd this shit aint school ya know
budd doesnt say anything he just moves towards the back passing by a stripper serving drinks
another stripper walks out of the ladies room and says to him hey budd honey the toilets at it again
theres shitty water all over the floor
ill take care of it suzie pie
a brand new enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking lot and stops
the bride sits behind the wheel looking at the bar and the bars front door
using the rearview as a mirror she grabs her long blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a rubberband
then places a baseball cap on the top of her noggin that reads stubbs bar b q
she steps out of the trucks cab
shes dressed like a little texas two stepper
levis cowboy boots and a harley davidson loud and proud tee shirt
the bride walks into the club just as the band on stage explodes into honky tonk guitar
she walks up to the bar and oders a shiner
the bartender gives her a beer bottle of shiner bock
as she drinks the texas brew
watches the band
looking for budd among the crowd
she sees him
hes the bouncer
she observes him
hes sitting on a stool observing the crowd moving his head to the music
shaw brothers zoom into her eyes vengeance theme plays on the soundtrack
her hand removes her sog from its sheath
she moves through the crowd of texas two steppers sog in hand towards budd sitting oblivious on his stool
suddenly a big cowboy stands up from his table spilling every bottle and glass on it and barfs all over
budd curses to himself and heads over to the disaster area
clean up the puke
as the music from above continues we see budd driving his pickup on an empty highway home from work
he passes by the brides new red pussy wagon parked on the side of the road
after he whizzes by she starts up the motor but doesnt turn the lights on
she follows him hanging way back in the dark
budd driving not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness trailing him
budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper home
he walks inside shutting the door behind him
the bride rolls to a stop
observing the lonely trailer out of her windshield
texas tear ass music begins coming out of the camper
we see his figure pass the camper window once or twice
the bride chooses her weapon hattori hanzos samurai sword
she doesnt say anything nor will an actress of uma thurmans caliber indicate her feelings but the astute member of the audience will read the significance of her choice
his current status be damned the budd who owes the bride satisfaction was a warrior
and its that budd she intends to send to his maker
she takes a black stocking cap and slips it on top of her skull tucking her blonde hair underneath
rubs black make up under both eyes on top of both eyelids and down the bridge of her nose
disconnects the cab lights above her opens the truck door and slips out unseen into the austin texas night air
on her belly hattori hanzo sword in sheath in hand she crawls across the desert floor towards budds trailer
somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat
their fight makes a loud racket
the bride stops and buries her face in the dirt
from inside the trailer we hear the needle being lifted off the phonograph
from a distance we see the shadowy figure of budd looking out the window of the camper
the bride keeps her face in the dirt
the figure of budd at the window seems to dismiss the sound he heard for what it was a rat meeting its end at the claws of a cat
the curtain closes again
the needle is placed back on the phonograph
cu the bride face in the dirt
her eyes look up towards the trailer
she begins crawling towards the trailer again
shes now right outside the trailer home
we can hear the sound of budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth
she hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed
the sound of pouring in a glass
the sound of a glass being laid heavy on a table
crouched low on the balls of her feet she with great care slowly and silently unsheathes her hanzo sword
through the bottom slit in the door she sees the distorted image of budds feet on the floor
she slowly rises
removes her black stocking cap
blonde hair falls around her shoulders
sword in right hand
left hand grabs the front doorknob
quick as a texas lizard on glass she brings the swords handle down hard on the door lock ex cu cheap lock busting
she flings the front door open
the brides pov brother budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair moving back and forth to the texas twang on his turntable cradling a double barrel shotgun aimed right at
the bride blinks
both barrels blast in our face
the bride standing in the doorway is hit smack dab in the chest and propelled through the air backwards
landing hard on her back in the dirt
budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the phonograph cutting off the music
then with shotgun in hand stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at the bride
the bride laid out in the dirt below him sword separated from her grasp bloody mess down her front groan from her throat
budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt standing over the bride
bet your sweet ass that dont sting like a bitch
more groans coming out of the blood splattered bride
you done got a double dose of rock salt right in the ole tit
now not havin tits as fine or as big as yours i cant even imagine how bad that shit stings
he lowers down on his haunchers over her
but i dont wont to neather
the bride hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast still nevertheless defiant spits a gob of bloody saliva right in ole budds face
budd gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose
the cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket and wipes away the goo
then his eyeballs go down to the spitter
now i know when it comes to a rock salt burn youre feelin pretty much like a expert bout now
but truth be told you aint felt all rock salts got to offer till you took a double dose in your backside
with the help of his cowboy boot he rolls the bride over onto her stomach exposing her butt
snapping the barrel closed he takes aim and fires both barrels execution style right into her keister
the bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any opponent during the movie up till now
her head rears back and she lets out a scream
that gentled ya down didnt it
aint nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their backyard
almost mercifully the man once known as sidewinder sticks a syringe in her arm dropping her unconscious
knocking down a swig of jack daniels he removes a small silver cell phone from his pants pocket raises the antenna and presses one button on the panel
the six foot tall long haired blonde with the codename california mountain snake is doing a savage boxing workout with her coach
this is one white bitch who can kick some serious fuckin ass
with one mighty blow from her huge right arm synched to the sound of a car crash her boxing coach buys the farm
elle on cell phone
we cut back and forth

pause and one more thing
you said one condition
its a caveat to the same condition
she must suffer to her last breath
that elle darlin i can pretty damwell guarantee
then ill see you in the morning millionaire
we look down on a spooky texas graveyard
low hanging fog
this could be the opening shot of a texas zombie movie
we also see two men with shovels one which is budd the other which is ernie digging up a grave
budds beat to shit pickup is in the shot too
its headlight beams shining on the two men
and last but not least the bride bound and gagged lying in the flatbed of budds pickup
the bride she begins to come to from the shot in her arm
some dried blood lies caked around her wounds
rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her
a big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots
her eyelids flutter open
and she sees stars
a giant black texas night sky full of them
she has no idea where she is
she turns her head to the left and sees back window and cab of truck
she turns her head to the right and sees hatch gate to flatbed
she hears crickets
the sound of two men digging
one of the men says something to the other in spanish
she hears one of the shovels hit something buried
the two men speak to each other in unsubtitled spanish
we hear them lifting something heavy we might assume is a coffin
the bride however knows not what to think
they set it down
she hears boots approaching the flatbed the crunching of leaves leading in her direction
with a clang and a scrape the latches on the gate of the flatbed are yanked out and it lowers open with a crash
revealing budd looking down on her
wakey wakey eggs and bakey
the grabs her by her collar and yanks her out of the truck
she falls to the dirt hard
once in the dirt the bride sees an old coffin thats been dup up
next to it is a brand new pine box coffin straight out of fistful of dollars
and a freshly dug grave with a pile of dirt next to it in front of an old tombstone that reads budd and ernie stand over her
the bride just glares up at the two tormentors with the only weapon she has left the contempt in her stare
budd turns to ernie and says in spanish subtitled in english look at those eyes
this bitch is furious
you grab her feet ill get her head
got anything to say
the bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction and she wont give it to them
in america white women call this the silent treatment
laughing and we let em think we dont like it
the two fiends laugh then bend down to lift the bride and carry her over to the pine box
she struggles with her bound legs and arms
both men drop her to the ground
budd whips out a can of mace from his pocket
hey hey hey wiggle worm look at this
he holds the can of mace spray by her eyes
her eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can then to budd
looky here bitch this is a can of mace
now youre goin underground tonight and thats all there is to it
but when i bury ya i was gonna bury you with this
he removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the beam
but if youre gonna act like a horses ass ill spray this whole goddamn can in your eyeballs
then youll be blind burnin and buried alive
so whats it gonna be sister
her eyes move to the right indicating the flashlight
you may be stupid but at least you aint bloody stupid
the two men lift up the bride and carry her over to the pine box and place her in
budd puts the flashlight inside
he picks up the pine lid and is just about to place it over the coffin
he locks eyeballs with the bride
her eyes hold his for as long as she can he places the lid over her face closing the coffin
with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut
dark excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between the lid and the box
however with each nail pounded in more lights is cut off
the only light left is the crack by the brides head
the last hammered nail obliterates that light source
the bride lies in total darkness
the two men lift the pine box and set it in the grave
budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt
ex cu her fingers turn on the flashlight
cu the bride lit by the flashlight beam
a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid making the bride jump
she reacts again
the dirt just keeps falling the bams becoming softer with each new shovelful
the bride is starting to perspire
her breathing becoming more rapid and panicked
her heartbeat begins to echo inside the pine box
weve never seen her like this before
shes starting to lose it
she lets out a scream
she screams again
her bound at the wrist hands move to the lid
she pounds on it
her bound feet kick up at it
she starts to cry
shes getting hysterical
her fingers begin clawing at the wood lid
theyre ripped open and bleeding
leaving blood trails on the wood
she exhausts herself
all this while shes been screaming the words we cant even imagine coming out of her mouth help me
the bride halts her hysteria
she wipes her eyes and runs her hands down her face mentally sending the little girl she became back to wherever she came from
the woman we know as the bride is back
she talks to herself
well now that youve had a nice good cry lets figure out how to get out of here
youre breathing like you just been fuckin
close your mouth and start breathing short breaths through your nose
the bride continues in vo thats a lot better
but youre still too agitated
can you hear your heart
its like im buried alive with buddy rich
turn off that flashlight
fear comes into her voice as she combats herself
i cant turn off the light
yes you can
the darkness will have a calming effect
now turn off that fucking light
the screen goes jet black budd and ernie are finished filling the grave
the old coffin with the body of paula schultz in the back of the flatbed
before they climb into the truck and drive away budd lays a dozen red roses on the brides grave
budd behind the wheel
ernie in the passengers seat
car radio playing mexican music
budds silver cell phone rings
into phone yellow
elle driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the great state of texas
she calls budd on the airplane phone
didja do it
elle darlin shes sufferin as we speak
a smile spreads across elles face
she rests her head back against the seats headrest
her eyelids close
she slightly parts her lips
and lets out a ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is the face of satisfaction
chapter eight the cruel tutelage of pai mei we see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of china
a voice over spoken by bill tells us a story over this landscape once upon a time in china some believe around the year one double knot three
as bill tells this story it will be illustrated on screen by footage from old shaw brothers martial arts flicks of the s
especially films that feature chinese actor lo lieh as the old white haired white eyebrowed villian pai mei
head priest of the white lotus clan pai mei was walking down the road contemplating whatever a man with pai meis infinite power would contemplate which is another way of
saying who knows
when a shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction
as the monk and the priest crossed paths
pai mei in a practically unfathomable display of generosity gave the monk the slightest of nods
the nod was not returned
was it the intention of the shaolin monk to insult pai mei
or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture
the motives of the monk remain unknown
what is known were the consequences
the next morning pai mei appeared at the shaolin temple and demanded that the temples head abbot offer pai mei his neck to repay the insult
the abbot at first tried to console pai mei only to find pai mei was inconsolable
so began the massacre of the shaolin temple and all sixty of the monks inside at the fists of the white lotus
and so began the legend of pai meis ten point palm exploding heart technique
what praytell is a ten point palm exploding heart technique
quite simply the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts
he hits you with his fingertips at ten different pressure points on your body
and then he lets you walk away
but once youve taken five steps your heart explodes inside your body and you fall to the floor dead
we see on screen pai mei demonstrate this technique on five shaolin monks
who after being hit
take five steps
then fall to the floor dead
bill and the bride years earlier driving in a jeep through the mountains of china enroute to pai meis
did he teach you that
he teaches no one the ten point palm exploding heart technique
but he is nietzsches psalm personified
if pai mei doesnt kill you he will make you stronger
now one of the things i always liked about you kiddo is you appear wise beyond your years
then allow me to impart a word to the wise
whatever what ever pai mei says obey
if you flash him even for an instant a defiant eye hell pluck it out
and if you throw any american sass his way he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs and that will be the story of you
the bride sits in the jeep by herself parked in front of the priest pai meis home located high up on top of white lotus mountain
for over years his home used to be the temple of the white lotus clan and he was the temples head priest
the temple served as a home to over priests and disciples
but now the year the white lotus clan is no more
all the priests have died
all that remains is a very old man who once upon a time some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil
neither was wrong
a huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill leading to pei meis home
bill climbs down to the jeep
hell accept you as his student
caught him in a good mood aye
more like a sadistic one
she climbs out and gets her bag out of the back
bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended
just seeing those steps again makes me ache
youre gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker
why did he accept me
because hes a very very very old man
and like all rotten bastards when they get old they become lonely
not that that has any effect on their disposition
but they do learn the value of company
when will i see you again
thats the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies
when he tells me youre done
when do you think that might be
that my dearest all depends on you
now remember no backtalk no sarcasm
least not for the first year
youre going to have to let him warm up for you
he hates caucasians despises americans and has nothing but contempt for women so in your case that may take a little while
the jeep speeds off down the road
leaving the bride all alone somewhere in the middle of china
she begins the journey before her by ascending the steps to pai mei
the huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred years ago except now its empty and dusty
the bride enters shes winded from climbing up those fuckin steps
her voice echoes in the cavernous temple
pai meis voice echoes back up the stairs yankee woman
a beautiful but dusty mahagony staircase leads to pai meis private chamber
to herself more stairs jesus christ
the still unseen mans voice booms back if it is christ you seek turn back now
she climbs the wooden staircase
pai meis pov we see through pei meis pupils through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area
the bride enters the room
she approaches the old man reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim lowers to one knee and bows her head
from here on end whenever english is spoken by the bride or every once in awhile by pai mei it will be spoken in english in live synch sound
however whenever mandarin is supposedly spoken it comes out of their mouths as dubbed english like in a s shaw brothers chop socky flick
teacher i am unworthy to be your student pai mei is still unseen
your mandarin is lousy
i cant understand a single word you say
it causes my ears discomfort
you are not to speak unless spoken to
do you understand mandarin any better than you speak it
i speak japanese very well i didnt ask if you speak japanese or mongolian for that matter
i asked if you understand mandarin
a little i am still learning
you are here to learn the mysteries of kung fu not linguistics
if you cant understand me i will communicate with you like i would a dog
when i yell when i point when i beat you with my stick
her head remains bowed eyes to the floor
hes just like he was in the films earlier
long white hair long white beard long white eyebrowes same long flowing white robe
everythings the same except hes older by about a hundred years
he sits stone still in his sitting area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim
bill is your master is he not
yes he is
your master tells me youre not entirely unschooled
what training do you possess
i am proficient in a combination of tiger and crane style
and i am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the samurai sword
he makes a snorting the exquisite art of the samurai sword
dont make me laugh
your so called exquisite art is only fit for japanese fat heads
you really are a silly ass
this brings up the brides eye
she glares at the old man
you dare glare at me
she lowers her eyes
im sorry master silence
i do not wish to hear your unintelligible excuses
pai mei softly laughs to himself and strokes his long white beard
your anger amuses me
do you believe you are my match
are you aware i kill at will
is it your wish to die
then you must be stupid
rise stupid and let me get a better look at your ridiculous face
cu the bride through the scrim eyes down
pai mei laughs to himself again you breathe hard
the one hundred steps robbed you of your wind
so your stupidity is matched only by your weakness
is there anything you do well
oh yes you speak japanese
i despise the goddamn japs
i would of thought an american would be immune to their pompous posturing
apparently i was wrong
go to that drawer
the blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer
she opens the drawer its filled with just about every type of edged weapon
remove the sword
the bride removes a large heavy steel chinese sword
pai mei rises from his sitting position for the first time parts the scrim and approaches the bride
lets see how good you really are
try and land a blow
if you land a single blow ill bow down and call you master
the bride doesnt need a second invitation she attacks with the sword
he deftly moves out of the way
the fighting style is now like an old shaw brothers film with pai mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes
quick and skillful as her moves are theyre also full of effort and frustration
while pai mei effortlessly moves out of the swords path
hes amused and speaks while they fight come now woman cant you even hit an old man
she tries more
your ability really is quite poor
he strikes her with a blow to her chest delivered with an open palm that sends her flying back hard against the wall
she clutches her chest and coughs up some blood
pai mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard
ha ha ha ha ha
ive fought cripples who posed more of a challenge
now fight goddamn you
she attacks with a wild cats fury
he hops and ducks and dodges her sword easily
he leaps high up in the air and lands standing on the blade of her sword
the bride looks down the blade of her sword and cant believe it
pai mei smiles at her and says from here you can get an excellent view of my foot
he does a backflip off the sword kicking the bride in the face in mid somersault sending her crashing through a wood the bride emerges from the hole in the
pai mei stands waiting for her twirling the sword in his hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton till the twirling stops
the swords handle is pointed towards the bride
or care to try again
the brides face shows determination
not to win not even to land a blow that she knows is impossible
this mans ability is truly amazing
however be that as it may shes determined not to quit and through not quitting shes determined to distinguish herself in his eyes
in some way
she takes the sword from him and tries again
but this time pai mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the sword manipulating it into positions that would do the young girl harm
like bringing the blade up against her other arm
poised to cut it off
that blades sharp
careful not to cut off your own arm
then he twists her arm till the blades against her own throat
then twists again till its against her hip
then twists again while kicking her leg till the blades edge is against her thigh
if you cant fight any better than that what use do you have for a leg
he lets go of her arms she swings furiously at him
he calmly spins out of the way
then he kicks her in the stomach doubling her over then he brings the sword between her legs blade edge against her crotch
now that really would be a shame
he takes the sword from her grasp
the bladess against her jugular
he swings twice
the blades against the pocket of her throat
he swings a third time
the blades against the nipple of her right breast
your swordsmanship is amateur at best
he tosses the sword in the air catching it by the tip of the blade
then like a mallet brings the handle end down hard on the top of the brides head
she lets out a howl and falls to the floor holding the lump on her noggin
im a hundred and fifty years old and you cant even make me break a sweat
he chops the sword in half with his hand
lets see your tiger and crane style match my eagless claw
again she attacks
again he eludes
like a gordon liu and lo lieh film they do their animal style martial arts dance
as she strikes and he blocks
he yells out pathetic
you idiot you shouldve landed that blow
you call that crane
enough i grow bored
with little effort on his part he reaches out and grabs her wrist twists
shes on the floor with her arm stuck out in the air behind her her wrist still between his fingers
he could literally break her arm in half
i asked you to show me what you know and you did
not a goddamn thing
he twists her wrist
the pain is excruciating
like all yankee women the only thing you know how to do is order in restaurants and spend a mans money
he twists more
she cries out
excruciating isnt it
i asked you a question
through gritted teeth she answers yes
i could chop off your arm at will
i think i shall
he raises his other hand to chop off her arm
the bride screams in english no please dont
if you wish to speak romantic languages youve come to the wrong place
please dont cut my arm off
its my arm now
i can do with it what i please
if you can stop me i suggest you try
because youre helpless
have you ever felt this before
compared to me youre as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle arent you
he lets go of her wrist
she cradles her still throbbing arm
is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you were
can you cook
ill be the judge of that
pause draw me a bath
your training will begin tomorrow
that arm is still mine
you may lose it yet
pai mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front of him
his right fist is cocked back by his breastplate hes concentrating on a certain spot on the wall
the bride stands behind him watching
he lets out a scream and puts his fist through the wall
he turns to the new student since your arm now belongs to me i want it strong
can you do that
i can but not that close
then you cant do it
i can put my hand through that at six inches
and you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope sight rifle if you so desired but this is not what i asked
what if your enemy is three inches in front of you what do you do then
curl into a ball
or do you put your fist through him
he hits the wall again leaving another hole
the bride takes her place in front of the wall
she hits it
only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her scraped knuckles
both pai mei and the bride sit at the dinner table
pai mei concentrates on eating
the brides hand is scraped bloody
she tries to eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks but her fingers wont work
she puts down the sticks and takes a scoop of rice with her fingers
pai mei whacks her on top of her head with his stick
if you want to eat like a dog i will make you live and sleep like a dog
if you want to live and sleep like a human being pick up those sticks
the bride hitting it
she looks at her fucked up hand then to the wall hesitating
then pai meis behind her
its the wood that should fear your hand not the other way around
no wonder you cant do it you acquiesce to defeat before you even begin
he walks off in a huff
pai mei and the bride stand at the edge of a large round deep pit dug in the earth by the bride
in that pit is a rat
we see one lone rat in the huge pit
in the sky is a bird
pai mei brings a golden bow and arrow into frame and shoots up in the sky
a bird falls to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through it
you are to go into that pit and catch that rat with your bare hands
if you catch the rat i will deem you the victor and tonight you will dine on bird
but if you cant catch the rat by sundown ill deem the victor the rat
and because of the disgrace to my student i will be forced to kill it
and then i will force you to consume his body
because to be my student you must develop a taste for victory
she hops into the pit gets down on the ground lock eyes with her rodent opponent and goes after it
the bride practicing her tiger crane combo kung fu
at night punching the wall in front of her in her sleep
trying to catch the rat to no avail
a golden arrow kills the rat
she looks up and sees pai mei golden bow in his hand looking down on her
she stands dusting herself off shes dirty from the chase and looks at her teacher
she picks her dead foe up from the earth and removes the golden arrow
then with the rat in her hand she looks up to her teacher
i acknowledge defeat at the paws of this rat
however i will not eat this filthy vermin
what i will do
she rips the rat open like a pomegranate is consume his victorious heart
she snatches the tiny heart from the rodents carcass
holding it between her fingers
but tomorrow you kill a big bird
she pops the tiny rat heart in her mouth and begins to chew
pai mei looking down on her says how does victory taste
we do a shaw brothers zoom into a cu on pai mei he gives an affirmative nod and grunt
the brides fist goes through the wall
to herself wow
pai mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub when he hears a noise
woman is that you who disturbs my meditation
she answers from outside the door yes teacher
she does bowing to one knee
what news do you find so worthy as to disrupt my bath
i did it teacher
i put my fist through the wall
pai mei and the bride looking at the hole in the wall
would you care to demonstrate
she moves in front of the wall
takes her position
her right hand in a fist locked and loaded into position
with her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where shell strike
like shes transferring her energy into the wood
she removes her left hand
she hits it hard but her fist doesnt go through
her eyes sneak a look at the old man who wears no expression
i think you watching is making me nervous
not only that it has you speaking before you were spoken to
and when she does she does it
he says in english impressive
she immediately goes down to her knees thank you teacher he just as immediately lifts her back up
you still fight better than you speak
finally a woman who understands whats important
he moves the wall one inch in front of her
then the old man leaves to finish his bath
the blonde gal begins again
fist against wood
starting all over
pitch black the flashlight beam turns on
cu the bride in profile
her breathing is normal
we can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box
her composure is back
taking the flashlight she shines the beam on the lid above her
along the line of the coffins rim and the lid where many nails meet
then down to her red cowboy boots bound by a leather belt around her
raising her knees as much as the coffin will allow and wiggling her feet she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belts binding
then using her bare feet then her bound at the wrist hands to pass one of the boots up to her
when the red boot is in her grasp she turns it upside down
the straight razor falls out
opening the razor she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists till both hands are free
she positions the flashlight so its beam shines on the coffin lid
the lids about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose about three inches from her hand
as combat drums begin to beat on the soundtrack she begins to concentrate
her eyes focus on the wood above her her left hand reaches out touches the pine passing her energy to it
her long white fingers ball up into a fist
and that fist begins striking the coffin lid above her
with each strike she lets out a karate scream
her fist smashes into the wood leaving blood on the lid
a crack in the lid
dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the bride
even more dirt
the lid smashes and dirt pours into the coffin like water
through six feet of dirt we watch the bride dig climb swim sprout burrow trough the earth like a sprouting plant and a burrowing mole combined clawing for surface air
a shot straight out of an italian horror film
we see the tombstone of paula schultz and the mound of dirt over her grave
the brides hand breaks the surface
then like one of fulcis zombies claws digs and pulls herself from mother earths womb
once extracted from her almost final resting place she rolls over on her back exhausted
she drinks in the nights air as if it were gulps of water
dirt is in on and under every crack crevice and wrinkle on her body
she looks like a beautiful sculpture made out of dirt
a texas diner across the street from the graveyard
a young soda jerk stands behind the counter waiting for a customer when he sees something approaching through the restaurants big picture window that makes him look twice
through the picture window we see the bride emerge from the texas night and walk towards the diner looking for all the world like a six foot tall female version
of the peanuts character pig pen
with each of her footfalls a smaller mushroom cloud of dust comes off her
the dirty blonde walks into the diner sits on a stool at the counter directly across from the soda jerk and says id like a glass of water
chapter nine elle and i behind the wheel of a hot black and gold trans am driving full out on top of the deserts surface
spanish rock coming out of her powerful speakers
the car stops in front of budds camper
she shuts off the car and the radio
the camper door opens budd squints outside through the bright gold hot desert morning at the tall blonde girl with one good eye
want some breakfast
budd and elle in the tiny kitchen of budds tiny camper
elle sits a the kitchen table a black suitcase by her feet
budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas as he finishes telling the tale of last night
so thats called a texas funeral
i got to give it to ya budd thats a pretty fucked up way to die
whats the name on the grave shes buried under
budd turns on the noisy blender as elle writes down the name paula schultz on a small notepad placing it back inside her pocket
as the blender mashes ice elle looks around and sees the brides hanzo sword in its sheath leaning up against the t
in the front room
budd shuts the blender off
can i look at the sword
thats my money in that black case isnt it
well then its your sword now
the tall blonde girl steps into the living room takes the hanzo sword and sits back down on the kitchen chair
she slowly removes the japanese steel from its wood sheath
so this is a hattori hanzo sword
budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars with breakfast margaritas
thats a hanzo sword alright
bill tells me you once had one of your own
how does this one compare to that one
if youre gonna compare a hanzo sword you compare it to every sword ever made wasnt made by hattori hanzo
here wrap your lips around this
he hands her her margarita she takes a sip
he takes a gulp
so which r you filled with
they say the number one killer of old people is retirement
people gotem a job to do they tend to live a little longer so they can do it
ive always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship
so now you aint gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more which r are you filled with relief or regret
a little bit of both
im sure you do feel a little bit of both
but i know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other
the question was which one
elle looks right at him with her eye and says regret
yeah you gotta hand it to the ol girl
i never saw nobody buffalo bill the way she buffaloed bill
bill useta think she was so damn smart
i tried to tell him
bill shes just smart for a blonde
he looks over at elle and grins
elle looks at him
want your money
she gestures to the black suitcase by her feet
he smiles and lifts it up on the table unzipping it open
lying inside is a cool million the thousand dollar bills are inside stacks of a hundred thousand each
at the sight of all this lettuce budd lets out a whistle
great day in the morning
he lifts a stack out of the bag then another then another
and when he lifts the third stack out he looks down and sees a black mamba snake coiled underneath
the black mamba opens its wide jaws
and leaps right at striking budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession three times in the face and once in the forearm
budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor bundles of money fall with him
elle takes a sip of her margarita
the black mamba leaves budd and goes under the refridgerator
elle looks down budd lies on his back on the kitchen floor at her feet
his face is already grotesquely swollen and white as a sheet
the serpents extraordinarily potent venom makes a full frontal assault on the cowboyss nervous system
oh im sorry budd that was rude of me wasnt it
budd id like to introduce my friend the black mamba
gesturing towards the refridgerator black mamba this is budd
you know before i picked up that little fella i looked him up on the internet
she removes her notepad from her pocket fascinating creature the black mamba
listen to this reading from the notepad
in africa the saying goes in the bush an elephant can kill you
a leopard can kill you
and a black mamba can kill you
but only with the mamba and this has been true in africa since the dawn of time is death sure
hence its handle death incarnate
looking up from the paper pretty cool huh
back to paper
its neurotoxic venom is one of natures most effective poisons acting on the nervous system causing paralysis
the venom of a black mamba can kill a human in four hours if say bitten on the ankle or the thumb
however a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within twenty minutes
up from paper to budd now you should listen to this cause this concerns you
reading from the paper the amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be gargantuan
looks up from paper you know ive always liked that word gargantuan and i so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence
back to paper if not treated quickly with anti venom to milligrams can be fatal to human beings
however the black mamba can deliver as much as to milligrams of venom from a single bite
elle finishes reading and puts the paper away
she looks down at budd at her feet going through all the symptoms she just described
now in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left let me answer the question you asked earlier more thoroughly
when it comes to that bitch i gotta lotta rs in me
revenge is one
retribution is another
rivalry is definitely one
but i got another r for that bitch you might be surprised to find out
but right at this moment the biggest r i feel is regret
regret that maybe the greatest warrior i have ever met met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin scrub alacky piece of shit like you
the woman deserved better
budd dying watches from the floor as elle takes out her cell phone and presses one button
the other party comes on the line but we never hear their side
into phone bill
i have some tragic news
pause your brothers dead
pause im sorry baby
budd tries to make a sound from the floor elle calmly places her foot over his mouth
she put a black mamba in his camper
pause i got her sweety
pause shes dead
pause let me put it this way
if you ever start feeling sentimental go to austin texas
when you get here walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers
then you take those flowers to huntington cemetery on fuller and guadalupe look for the headstone marked paula schultz then lay them on the grave
because you will be standing at the final resting place of beatrix kiddo
the brides drivers license the real one with both her picture and the name beatrix kiddo
yes thats her real name
classroom of st graders on the first day of class
a st grade teacher reads roll call melanie harrhouse
we whip pan across a bunch of kids to an ex cu of st grader here
whip pan to an ex cu of the grown up bride here
im so sorry baby
look i can get there in about four hours should i come over
pause no no no no no you need me baby
pause okay im leaving now go smoke some pot or something
ill be there soon
she hangs up the cell phone and looks down at the dead man under her shoe
picking up the hanzo sword she climbs down on the floor on her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money
cu the black mamba out from under the refrigerator behind elle
elle senses it
and slowly turns her head to look back
both black mamba and elle driver lock eyes
zoom into both cus tighter and tighter till elle says bring it on bitch
the viper known as death incarnate leaps at elle
elle flicks her wrist slightly
she doesnt even swing the blade
she just holds it
the snakes head touches it and is immediately separated from its body
elles eyes look down at the japanese steel in her hand
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel
now thats what i call sharp
elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black suitcase in her hand
she climbs into her gold and black trans am starts up the engine turns on the radio
she thinks she hears something
she looks out her drivers side car door window
the dirty blonde bride behind the wheel of her new enormous red pickup truck heading right for her
cu the bride behind the wheel heading right for her
vegeance theme her jaw drops open
not only does she see the dead walk she sees the dead behind two tons of metal coming at her at mph
the red pickup t bones the trans am the gold and black car flies through the air then rolls over and over about five times in the desert sand and
ending upside down
the dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of the black and gold sports car
a smile with the slightest hint of satisfaction spreads across her face
she hops out of the truck and into budds camper
as she walks through the door budds dead swollen body greets her
as does her serpent namesake dead on the floor from decapitation
she begins searching the camper quickly for something in particular
we dont have the slightest clue what it could be
ex cu the brides eye watching
the brides pov budds camper seen from up high looking down
the bride searching the camper
ex cu her eye
the brides pov budds camper budd exits by himself
the bride searching the camper
ex cu the brides eye
the brides pov she watches from a high perch budd practicing with a
the bride searching under his bed she sees a sword on the floor resting in a shiny black wood mahagony sheath
she removes it from its hiding place
its one of hanzos sheaths
she opens it
it is a hanzo sword
near the handle etched in the steel are the english words to my brother budd the only man i ever loved from bill
she closes the sheath this will do
she sees a pair of cowboy boots
picks one up and places the sole of the boot against the sole of her foot
her feet and this mans boot are around the same size
she slips her dirty feet in them
shes good to go
elle crawls from the wreckage of the trans am holding the hanzo sword looking like shes just been in a car wreck
a cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face
luckily for her not the side with the good eye
the camper door swings open
the bride emerges from budds home looking like a barbie doll thats been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard carrying a hanzo sword
every footfall creating a cloud of dust
the two women each carrying a samurai sword face each other in showdown position
a shark smile spreads across elles face
i actually thought that alacky had got the best of you
you thought wrong
the bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish
elle does the same
referring to the sword whats that
budds hanzo sword
he said he pawned it
guess that makes him a liar dont it
without raising their swords into position the two blonde warriors circle each other
i was wondering just tween us girls what did you say to pai mei for him to snatch out your eye
of pai mei snatching out elles eye with his eagles claw
i called him a bastard
oooh not so good
were i to do it over again id bite my tongue
one more question
gulf of mexico
elle nods her head yes
you wouldnt lie to me now
elle raises up the brides hanzo sword into position
the bride raises up her sword
i saw what you did to that little mamba in there
want to try that on somebody your own size
i intend to
the bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai bearing
oh elle i should warn you before we get started
hattori hanzo swords are extremely sharp
they can take a little getting used to
careful not to cut your own arm off
i dont rattle bitch
the bride brings her sword back into combat position
youre gonna bleed though youre gonna bleed a lot
the two blonde warriors
swords in position
no longer circle each other
but instead move forward
closer and closer to each other
one baby step at a time
their separate grips on the swords handle
their feet moving closer
the brides eye
the tips of each others blade
their blonde hair
as the operatic spaghetti western music builds to a crescendo
we cut back and forth between cus of the two women that get tighter and tighter as we zoom in closer and closer
we reach the themes climax
both women let loose with a samurai grunt and swing
two shot the two women warriors stand their ground striking and defending
when they stop no ones been touched
the two women swords in attack position stare across to the other one as they prepare for their next attack
now they begin to circle again
cu their feet making a circular walk
ex cu blades meet however this time we dont know whos on the left or the right
one blade maneuvers around the other
ex ex cu of tip of blade slicing open skin about a quarter of an inch
it looks like a scalpel cut
just skin separating
we dont know whos cut
the two women stand and face each other
neither knows if its them who has been struck
neither woman bleeds
we feel a count of
ex cu one silver blade clean as a whistle
ex cu one silver blade with a smudge of crimson blood on its we feel a count of two mississippi
blood begins to projectile spray out of a slice in elles neck only a quarter of an inch long
the blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a fine red mist like that of an aerosol can we even hear the slight spray whistle
elle feels nothing
she turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray and sees the blood escaping her like air from a balloon
she lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray its immediately bathed in red
elle drops the brides sword
as her blood continues to escape both women look across each other
the effect is that elle driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes
and now looking across at each other the two women see the other for the first time not as adversaries or opponents or as rivals or as bitches
but as sisters
elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up
she falls to her knees in front of the bride
then as she dies she leans the side of her head against the brides standing body
her blood runs down the brides leg
as she passes on elle gently wraps her arms around the brides leg
the brides hands go down to elles long blonde hair and begins gently stroking it easing her pain as she expires
only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have been theirs
the bride standing elle on her knees the desert surrounds them
the bride putting a shovel down
the bride has finished burying elle
she sticks a jerry rigged wood cross in the ground as a marker
then using her sog carves the name l
driver on the cross
then drives away in the big red pickup
final chapter the blood splattered bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home named villa quatro located on the beach in mexico
at the moment bill partaking of his current hobby
with his hands among various flowers of bright colors he sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement
ex cu the brides eye watching
bills mexican housekeeper josephina appears on the patio
bill you wanted me to tell you to leave now
finishing up yes i got to go and meet the duchess
referring to the flowers do you like it
oh yes mr
bill its very pretty
why dont you put it on the dinner table so we can enjoy it tonight
she takes it good idea shell love it
as he heads out the patio he tells her oh and josephina take the remaining flowers and spread them around the house if you would
he exits the patio then turns around and pops his head back in
you know i just had a great idea
take the roses and spread the petals on the bed i just got for her
thatd be a nice thing to come home to wouldnt it a bed of roses
oh shell love that mr
you wouldnt mind doing that for me would you josephina
no not at all
ex cu the brides eye watching
we follow behind bill as he moves through his house
he slips on his jacket
grabs his keys
two energetic german shepherds follow him out the front door onto his driveway
on his way to his silver porsche he roughhouse plays with the dogs speaking to them in spanish
when he gets to the sports car the dogs wont leave him alone and one jumps on the porsche
he yells at it in spanish get the fuck off the car lucy lucy down
ex cu the brides eye watching
the gates in front of bills hacienda home open and his silver porsche hits the streets running
ex cu the bride watching
a suspense theme plays over the shots of the brides eye every time we cut to it
over the shots of bill driving we hear a spanish tragic love ballad coming from the car radio
driving his convertible as the beach whizzes by in the background
the brides eye
dirt road lined by greener than green trees the porsche kicks up dirt zooming down it
driving as the spanish love song plays
the brides eye
a striking but antiseptic looking institution of some sort surrounded by the beautiful foliage of mexico
bills silver porsche drives up its driveway
the brides eye
the institution is not spanish in style but on the contrary its a clinical new age box like structure made up of clear glass doors and walls and the color
bill walks through the glass doors to a lone asian female receptionist her desk is the only furniture in the lobby
in japanese he explains to her his reason for being there
ex cu the brides eye watching
we now leave any shot of bill not from the brides perspective
the suspense theme is stretched tighter and tighter as we look through the brides pov and listen to her vo the attentive audience members among you will have probably noticed
that all my kills have been straight up fights
the brides pov the glass enclosed institution and bill standing by himself in the empty lobby
yall figured id face him with my hanzo sword aye
well i figured bill figured the same thing
i am the product of three godfathers
bill pai mei and hattori hanzo
different teachers teach you different things
but one thing i learned from all three was in combat the opponent that does the unexpected can usually expect to be the victor
bill would never see this coming
not from me
and least any of you judge me a bushwhacker remember
it was bill who taught me how to shoot
as the bride has said these things weve seen inserts of her putting together her high powered scope rifle
snapping on the scope sight
setting the focus through the crosshairs
loading the heavy duty ammo
curling her long white finger around the rifles trigger
scope sight pov bills head in between the crosshairs
suspense theme is stretched tighter still
it will soon break
looking through the institutions glass wall
the elevator in the lobby opens
and a little girl steps out and runs into bills arms
a little girl about five years old
a five year old little girl with blonde hair
bill picks up the little girl and lifts her head into the crosshairs of the scope suspense theme snaps into an operatic wail
ex cu the brides finger pops off the trigger
ex cu the brides eye a huge tear falls out
we move out of the eyeball into a medium cu of the bride tears falling down her face
she cant believe what shes looking at
thats her daughter
her remembering theme plays
the bride remembering while she was in her wide eyed coma state lying on an operating table as doctors and nurses performed a cesarean childbirth on her
the newborn infant is passed to other hands above her wide eyed unblinking expressionless face
cu of the bride in one moment bill has managed to suddenly change the game
silence except for a few birds
we hear the roaring of an engine and the silver porsche whizzes into frame
bill behind the wheel his little girl asleep in the passenger seat
he sees something ahead
a convertible volkswagen karman ghia enters the road heading in the opposite direction
its a long long long way off but it will get closer every second
bill senses something about this automobile and throws a glance at his sleeping child
his cell phone rings he answers it
the bride behind the wheel of the convertible her long blonde hair whipping in the wind talks to bill for the first time in five years and six months
kiddo is that really you
oh its me all right
i hear you were driving a truck
my pussy wagon died on me
whos your little friend
he glances down at the sleeping child
oh you mean the little tow head next to me who looks extraordinarily like you
yeah that one
her name is b
the bride gets choked up again emotion betrays her voice
do you approve
she wipes her eyes
her hand moves under her shirt fingertips rest on scar
can she hear us
not now shes in dream land
how old is she
what do you mean by that
how many years has she been alive
dont ask how old she is ask if shes five
is she five
arent mothers like god arent you supposed to automatically know
i did and i do
pause i want to meet her
have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight
shes expecting you
what do you mean
i knew you were on your way so i told b
her mommy was coming to see her
confused what have you told her about me
that you were sick that you were asleep but one day youd wake up and come back to her
and she asked me if mommys been asleep since i was born how will she know what i look like
to which i replied because mommys been dreaming of you
and she said then im gonna start dreaming of her
so i gave her a picture of you which one
the one i took of you in paris sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand
since she was one and a half years old shes slept with that picture of you next to her bed
the exact photo dissolves over the brides face then you know prettier photos of me do exist
and shes seen them
but the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread
pause we normally have dinner around seven is that convenient
the cars get closer
when do we cross swords
well it just so happens my hacienda comes with its very own private beach
and my private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight
and there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight
so swordfighter if you want to sword fight thats where i suggest
but if you wanna be old school about it then we can wait till dawn and slice each other up at sunrise like a couple real life honest to goodness
as per usual kiddo ill leave the big decisions up to you
the cars will soon pass
do me a courtesy
slow down as we pass
i want another look at her
wear something nice tonight
i have a dress all picked out
will i like it
you said i looked beautiful last time you saw me in it
ill dress up too
his foot moves off the gas slowing the car her foot does the same
the cars in slow motion start to pass
the bride looks into the other car
we zoom past bill to the little girl in the passenger seat
we go one frame at a time till the car moves past us to bill holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our face
it emits only a tiny phoof
the bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the drivers side window explodes over her head
the two cars pass each other
the bride straightens herself in the drivers seat
she looks in the rearview as bill and her daughter drive away
grabbing the cell phone she screams in it you fucking maricone
bill on his cell eyes on rearview
now you just wait one second there little missy
unless im confused we are trying to kill each other arent we
now i wasnt planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt but she is asleep
and if youre gonna forget everything i ever taught you and gawk like you aint got good sense im gonna take a shot am i not
did she wake up
of course not
shes like you that way
i look forward to this evening
it was great speaking with you bea
he hangs up
hattori hanzo lies sleeping on his mat
his phone wakes him up in the middle of the night
he hurriedly answers it
in phone groggy hello
the brides on the phone calling japan in tears
beatrix whats wrong
my baby girls alive
the same shot we saw during the opening credits
shes dressed in a white bridal gown the exact replica of the one she was bushwhacked in
over her cu we dissolve to a cu of hanzo talking to her earlier on the phone
half of bills strength lies in his talent for the unexpected
if you intend to vanquish this man and claim your daughter you must not only expect the unexpected
you must do the unexpected
we dissolve back to the bride
we see the same shots as before of the bride driving up to bills villa through his iron gates and parking by his front door
we see two black suited male satellites approach her
now comes the new stuff
she climbs out of her vehicle goes to the back opens the boot and removes her mossberg pump action shotgun
the two satellites freeze
she slides the pump once and fires
one is blown apart by the blast
she slides the pump a second time
two buys the farm
she slides the pump again
and blasts the front door kicking it open and stepping inside
another black suited satellite hurries down the stairs reaching for his weapon
she fires the shotgun into his kneecap
he tumbles down the stairs landing at her feet
she points the shotgun straight down at his face
then moves further into the house
apparently this is the do the unexpected part of her plan
fuck the charade storm the camp kill everyone she comes across send bill to hell scoop up her daughter and head for parts unknown
so far so good
she enters the butcher block kitchen and finds bills cook and housekeeper josephina
josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her
hello miss beatrix
she grabs the housekeeper and shoves her into the kitchen pantry
stay in here and dont come out
if you leave this room ill shoot you comprende
she closes the pantry door and moves into the hallway leading to the living room
with her back against the wall holding her weapon tight she moves down the hall
as she creeps an unseen bill yells to her from around the corner
if youre through shooting the servants im in the living room
you remember how to get to the living room dontcha
go down to the end of the hall and make a left
back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end
she pumps the slide and turns the corner shotgun raised ex cu the brides eyes blink once
ex cu her finger comes off the trigger
what the bride sees in front of her is bill in a tuxedo holding a small orange squirt gun pointed at her
standing next to him is five year old little b
dressed up in a very pretty party dress arm outstretched holding a orange squirt gun aimed at the bride
the three look at each other for a moment then bill says loudly bang bang
then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like hes just been shot
mommy got us
lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside her dad
bill falls to the floor
oh im dying
oh im dying
bill on the floor says up to his little girl fall down sweetheart mommy shot you
the little girl falls down pretend dead
the bride still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them is truly thrown
bill delivers his lines from the floor spoken like a dying breath you did it quick draw kiddo
you are the fastest
and with these last words pretends to die
but then while pretending to be dead he speaks in a dramatic narrators voice
little did quick draw kiddo know
that five year old b
gunn was only playing possum due to the fact she was impervious to bullets
raises her head off the floor and says to mommy im impervious to bullets mommy
hey get back down there youre playing possum
the little girls head drops back down
bill continues his dramatic narration so as the smirking killer approached what she thought was a bullet ridden corpse
thats when the little b
springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says bang bang
the bride continues watching in gobsmackery
bill raises his head off the floor and says to her in his normal voice mommy youre dead so die
the bride shakes off her confusion and acts out a big death scene fo her little girl
you got me
i should have known you are the best
she falls to the floor and pretends to die
the little girl in her party dress runs over to the big girl in her wedding dress and kneels over her mommy
mommy opens her eyes
dont die mommy i was just playing
from the floor looking up at her daughter she speaks to her for the first time
i know baby
they embrace each other
i waited a long time for you to wake up mommy
did you dream of me i dreamed of you
the female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins to creep into her voice every single night baby
she holds her daughter out at arms length to get a better look at her
now let me look at you
my my my
what a pretty girl you are
youre pretty too mommy
starts stroking her mothers long blonde hair
all of a sudden bill has joined them on the floor
when i showed you mommys picture tell mommy what you said
the little girl gets shy
cmon shy girl you know what you said tell mommy itll make her fell good
as she strokes her long blonde hair little b
says i said i said youre the most beautiful woman i ever saw in the whole white world
thats the truth
thats what she said
points to mannys blood which splashed a little on the brides wedding gown
oh mommy spilled something on her dress
do you like kool aid
do you not like it or do you not know what it is
parroting bill i do not know what it is
well its a very tasty beverage that i used to drink when i was a little girl
it comes in a lot of different flavors and colors and its really good
maybe we should fix some sometime
want to do that
the little girl gives a big nod yes
speaking of fixing and drinking and eating i think its dinner time dont you
does an exaggerated nod yes
to mommy when you were doin all that fancy shootin you didnt happen to shoot a nice mexican woman about forty five years old did ya
wiping imaginary sweat off his brow whew then dinner should be done
shouting to the other room josephina
you can come out now were ready for dinner
he offers his hand to mommy and helps her to her feet
then says to b
want to go on top of the world
she says excitedly yeah
he scoops the little girl up puts her on his shoulders and as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through the house towards the dinner table
bill and b
sing the carpenters song top of the world
its obviously one of their songs
the dining room of bills house
the family mother father and daughter sit at the dinner table eating
dont you think mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world
yes i do
in fact its better than pretty
whats better than pretty
very good gorgeous
mommy is gorgeous
the bride shows no sign of thawing around bill
you know baby mommys kinda mad at daddy
where you a bad daddy
im afraid i was
i was a real bad daddy
to mommy our little girl learned about life and death the other day
you want to tell mommy about what happened to emilio
i killed him
i didnt mean to but i stepped on him and he stopped moving
emilio was her goldfish
she came running into my room holding the fish in her hand crying daddy daddy emilios dead
and i said really thats so sad
how did he die
and what did you say
i stepped on him
actually young lady the words you so strategically used were i accidentally stepped on him
to which i queried and just how did your foot accidentally find its way into emilios fishbowl
and she told me no no no emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him
beat hummmmmm the plot thickens
and just how did emilio get on the carpet
and mommy you would have been real proud of her because she didnt lie
she said she took emilio out of his bowl and put him on the carpet
and what was emilio doing on the carpet baby
he was flapping
and then you stomped on him
and when you lifted your foot up what was emilio doing then
he stopped flapping didnt he
and you knew what that meant didnt you
what did that mean
he was dead
to mommy she told me later that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping she knew he was dead
is that not the perfect visual image of life and death
a fish flapping on the carpet and a fish not flapping on the carpet
so powerful even a five year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant
not only did she know emilio was dead she knew she had killed him
so she comes running into my room holding emilio in both of her little hands it was so cute and she wanted me to make emilio better
and i asked her why did she step on emilio
and she said she didnt know
but i knew why
you didnt mean to hurt emilio you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him right
and what happens when you stomp on emilio is you kill him
and you discovered that didnt you
so we drove down to the beach had a little funeral and gave emilio a burial at sea
and right now im sure hes happy as can be swimmin around in fish heaven
but the point being our child learned two very important lessons
one about life and death
the other somethings once you do they cant be undone
i knew just how she felt to b
you loved emilio didnt you
well sweety i love mommy but i did to mommy what you did to emilio
you stomped on mommy
making his finger a gun i shot mommy
not pretend shoot like we were just doing
i shot her for real
i dont know
did you want to see what would happen
no i knew what would happen to mommy if i shot her
what i didnt know is when i shot mommy what would happen to me
i was very sad
and that was when i learned somethings once you do they can never be undone
what happened to mommy
why dont you ask mommy
are you okay mommy
does it hurt
no sweety it doesnt hurt anymore
did it make you sick
it put me to sleep
thats why i havent been with you b
ive been asleep
but youre awake now right
im wide awake pretty girl
bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine
the steps lead to the beach and the sea
beatrix steps out onto the porch and sits down on the steps across from him
between them the dawn sky breaks
did she go to sleep easy
it took her a little bit
she was excited
shes quite the little chatterbox
well if she doesnt like you you got to kill her to say hello
but if she likes you you cant shut her up
shes a chip off the ole blonde in that regards
he holds up the bottle of vino
she shakes her blonde head no
cmon bea youre a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya
she gives him a look
pointing towards the beach were going to go out there and have at it arent we
she shakes her blonde head yes
well ive already had a glass
so unless you want to win by an unfair advantage you should have a glass of wine
so were both on the same footing wine wise
she holds out the empty glass and he fills it with red
you know theres an old man down here his name is esteban viharo
he was a pimp
i knew him when i was a child
he was a friend of my mothers
i told him about you
when i showed him your picture he smiles and said imitating his accent yesss i see the attraction
he told me a story about taking me to the movies when i was five
it was a movie which had lana turner in it
and whenever she would appear on screen he said i would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it to an obscure amount
and he knew right then this boy will be a fool for blondes
who would of ever thought youd be such a good father
well not you thats for damn sure
she gives him another look
must we have to endure your little zingers
no we mustnt
but if youre going to say sentences like that in the future i will resist the temptation
baby you dont have a future
bill drinks some wine
i sent you to l
and you never came back
i thought youd been killed
do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead
i mourned you
then in the third month of my mourning i track you down
i wasnt trying to track you down i was trying to track down the fucking assholes who i thought killed you
and when i find you what to i find
not only are you not dead youre getting married to some fuckin jerk and youre pregnant
how do you expect me to react
why do you think i hid
why did you leave in the first place
you have cold eyes towards me now
i understand their temperature but they were warm the second to the last time i saw them or was that just my imagination
the bride decides to tell all
as she tells this story parts will be shown on the screen
to give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in japanese you sent me to l
to kill that lady scoundrel lisa wong
bill interrupts her
you are you talking in japanese
the bride explodes what the hell do you care what i talk in
dont you know when to keep your mouth shut
im trying to tell you what you want to know if youll just shut up and listen and stop talking
now may i continue
youre right im wrong continue
the morning i left i threw up
i dont feel like speaking in japanese anymore on the plane i threw up
when i got to my hotel i threw up
so naturally i started thinking maybe i might be pregnant
so i bought one of those home pregnancy kits
went back to my room and took the test
the little strip said blue
i was going to have a baby
i tried to call you but you werent there so i just thought id call back later
but you never did
would you shut up im trying to tell you how i feel
my apologies please continue
so i just figured id call you back later
i was just so happy i put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite holding my little blue strip
what i didnt know was at some leg of my journey i was spotted
with me in los angeles it didnt take lisa wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her
so she sent an assassin of her own to kill me in my hotel room
as i was dancing in euphoria the killer came down the hall
theres a knock on the hotel room door
the bride stops dancing and goes to the doors peephole
peephole pov a pretty korean woman in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager
shes holding a basket of flowers
the bride says through the door hello can i help you
hello im karen kim im the hospitality manager of the hotel
i have a welcome gift from the management
seeing it through the peephole
oh its beautiful
but im kinda busy at this second could you possibly come back later
as she talks she accidentally drops the blue strip she bends down to pick it up
a shotgun blast blows a hole in the door right where the bent over woman was previously standing
karen kicks open the door pump action shotgun in hand
the brides on her back on the floor below her
karen aims the shotgun down at her
with her foot the bride kicks the front door
it slams back hitting karen in the face
the bride scrambles to her feet running for cover
karen pushes the door aside steps into the room and fires the shotgun the brides way
the bride dives out of the way
the blast destroys the side of the room it hits
the bride comes up from the floor with her sog in her hand and throws it across the room at karen
karen blocks the thrown knife with her shotgun
the blade sticking in the weapons wooden stock
she removes the knife and drops it to the floor
the bride is a sitting duck
theres nothing she can do except wait to get shot
so you came here to kill lisa wong huh
well thats my sister bitch
im karen wong and ive come here to kill you
she raises the shotgun and takes aim at the bride
wait a second
yes im an assassin
yes i did come here to kill your sister
but im not gonna do that now
oh i know youre not listen to me
i just found out right now not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door im pregnant
karen looks at her what
on that table is the home pregnancy kit
on the floor by the door is the strip that says im pregnant
im telling you the truth i dont want to and i wont kill your sister
i just want to go home
what is this bullshit story number twelve in the female assassins handbook
any other time youd be a hundred percent right
but this time youre a hundred percent wrong
im the deadliest woman in the world but right now im scared shitless for my baby
please you hafta believe me
look at the strip its on the floor
karen looks over to the door and sees the tiny strip on the floor
sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head
the bride complies
karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor
then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box
blue means pregnant
ill read it myself thank you
it is blue karens starting to believe her
okay say i were to believe you what then
just go home
ill do the same
she starts backing out of the room
before she leaves she says you fucked with the wong sisters
facing karen wong was the most frightening moment i have ever experienced
and that includes three years with that evil bastard pai mei
before that strip turned blue i was a woman i was your woman
i was a killer who killed for you
before that strip turned blue i would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train for you
but once that strip turned blue i could no longer do any of those things
because now i was a mother
a mother who only had one thought on her mind
please dont harm my baby
can you understand that
but why tell me now and not then
you wouldnt have let me go
specially once you found out i was pregnant
you wouldve tried to talk me out of it
it would have been a big scene
i just said fuck it
starting to get mad
bill you couldnt know i was pregnant once you knew youd claim it and i didnt want that
thats not your decision to make
yes but its the right decision
and i made it for my daughter
everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate
but with us my daughter would be born into a world she shouldnt be
robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves
she would be born with blood stains
i had to choose
i chose her
she takes a sip of wine
its morning now
and now its her turn
you know five years ago if i had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen
you performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown would be right at the top of the list
beat idve been wrong wouldnt i
bill listens stoney then im sorry was that a question
of impossible things that could never happen yes in this instance you would have been wrong
the bride listens stoney then well
i already have
when i told you the story of when i thought you were dead
didnt you get how badly i felt
you call that an explanation
well if thats too cryptic lets get literal
beat there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard
you experienced some of them
thats his explanation
she hears it
they both understand one another
you and i have unfinished business
baby you aint kidding
they both laugh
you know how proud i am of you dont you
you know i was rooting for you dont you
you know on that beach out there i want you to be the victor
she nods her head yes
you also know youre going to have to defeat me
i cant just give it to you even though i want to
it wont be necessary for you to give me anything
ive surpassed you
ill take it
well as they say in missouri show me
as the blue waves of the gulf of mexico crash on the beach the bride in her bridal gown and bill his tuxedo jacket off face each other in a
the bride breeze blowing her blonde hair holding her hanzo sword in its sheath
stares across the sand to the figure of the bride his student facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to use
this is where all who teach combat artistry may end up
facing a frankenstein monster of their own creation
he removes his hanzo sword from its sheath with great flourish
the two combatants
quite far from each other
they intend to charge attack
stand in showdown stance
the bride the vengeance theme explodes on the soundtrack
she takes her combat stance
but what she doesnt do is remove her sword from its wood sheath
the fist of her left hand is wrapped around the wood sheaths center
her right empty hand raises and makes a beckoning gesture to bill
then with a face completely devoid of emotion says in japanese attack me
shes facing him sword in sheath hand far from handle in a standing still position not moving a muscle of blinking an eye staring her laser beams in bills direction
waiting for his attack
he stands in a combat position sword raises in a combat grip to charge her
to himself thats my girl
he screams a samurai scream
and charges her
she stands motionless
watching him coming
we go back and forth close wide low
using only her left arm with the sheathed hanzo sword in its grip she blocks all of his blows right arm unmoving down at her side
sort of like pai mei did to her earlier
his sword and her sheath lock together
theyre close to each other she brings up her right arm sticks out two fingers and hits bill on ten different pressure points on his body
then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm
his body jolts like hes just had a heart attack
he coughs up a little blood
he looks at her
their faces are very close
the face of the cold ice woman ninja melts away before our eyes and the face of beatrix kiddo is filled once again with compassion
he taught you the ten point palm exploding heart technique
of course he did
why didnt you tell me
she doesnt have an answer
she looks at him apologetically i dont know
he smiles at her duplicitly and says with blood on his lips no
youre not a bad person
youre a terrific person
youre my favorite person
but every once in awhile
you can be a real cunt
they smile at each other
bill turns his back to her
and walks five steps in the opposite direction
with each step his heart swells on the fifth
we hear a sound like of a tire blowout
he falls to the beach
the bride walks over to his body
she unsheaths her hanzo sword
blood lies in a pool by bills mouth
she dips the tip of the blade in the blood leaving the tiniest of crimson smudges
she then removes the bill handkerchief and wipes bills blood from off the blade onto the white cloth
she lets the bill handkerchief drop onto his body
the jingi sword hattori hanzo created just for her for this purpose has come to the end of its journey
beatrix in a moment of enormous generosity allows herself one final tear shed for her corrupter her enemy the father of her child
the tear is for her as well
for shes very aware she will never ever be completely any other mans woman
ex cu the hanzo blade slowly sliding into the wood sheath
ex cu the single teardrop sliding down her cheek
the blade disappears inside the sheath
the teardrop falls of her chin
her journey her revenge her victory her unfinished business is completed
the bride exits the beach
as a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack
we see the bride get b
the bride and b
are driving away
the bride and b
eating in a coffee shop
the bride and b
in a motel room
they both wear bath towels and both of their blonde heads are wet
the bride sits behind her on the bed combing the little ones head
the bride spooning b
from behind both of them are asleep
its the morning
sits on the motel room bed watching saturday morning cartoons on t
the bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom crying her eyes out
she shoves a towel in her mouth so b
wont hear her
we wonder for a moment whats wrong
till we see her face in cu
her tears are tears of joy
she cant believe this is even happening
her daughter is alive
they get to begin again
she covers her mouth so b
wont hear her crying and get worried or confused
but as the deadliest woman on the planet lies on the motel room bathroom floor smile on her face twinkle in her eyes happier than shes ever been she thinks
over and over again
thank you god
thank you god
thank you god
thank you god
she washes her face in the sink when shes presentable she walks out of the bathroom jumps on the bed with her baby hugs her from behind as the two
watch saturday morning cartoons
both blonde heads the big one and the little one next to each other watching t
the lioness has been reunited with her cub and all is right in the jungle
