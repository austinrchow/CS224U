written by dan pyne current revisions by glenn gers january an unfinished mechanical device a scaffold of thin metal pipes levers pulleys wiring serve motors
thomas crawford works on it in his s well dressed but in disarray graying stubble hair and clothes unkempt
magnifying glasses distort his eyes making them huge and strange
he sets aside a tool takes a marble sized ball bearing and drops it into a slot at the top of the device
his enlarged eyes follow the metal ball as it rolls and flips and spirals through a rube goldberg style maze setting off bells clicking past turnstiles then missing a leap
and clattering across the work table
eyes on the device crawfords hand traps the ball
he stays still analyzing
he selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal working and electronics tools
makes a miniscule adjustment to a single joint
drops in another ball
it rolls and flips and spirals all the way down
crawford doesnt react
just studies the machine
behind him on a desk a framed photograph of a beautiful woman in her mid s
jennifer crawford is just reaching orgasm with rob nunally mid s good looking aging boyish
they clutch each other shuddering lost in passion
and then breathing heavily caressing each other nunally rolls off her slowly coming back to earth
jennifer studies her lover a quiet play of relief and gratitude and satisfaction on her face darkened by a troubled distance maybe even fear
she is after all having an affair
crawford stares through the grotesque lenses motionless expressionless
he takes a deep breath and checks his watch
then he stands removing the glasses
we now see his office large austere
decor and equipment related to aircraft engineering
outside big windows jets take off from an industrial airstrip
crawford gets a brand new bottle of jack daniels from a desk drawer uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private bathroom
he gargles spits into the sink
he pours out more then puts the half empty bottle back on his desk
he collects a home made device from the workbench it looks like a pda connected by wires to a blank credit card
he puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket which he sets on the desk
adjusts the placement of the open bottle nearby
crawford goes to a light box studying a set of large x rays dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal
tina his assistant appears in the doorway
guys are here
doesnt look up yep
she hesitates a second glancing at the bottle
crawford ignores her pulling an x ray off the light box and grabbing his jacket which knocks over the bottle
it skitters across the desk liquor spilling
crawford just walks out past tina
the twisted torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor
investigators in shirtsleeves and aircraft company executives in suits cluster around work boards covered with photographs and diagrams of a crash site
they look up falling silent as crawford comes in carrying the x ray
a few exchange surprised concerned glances this is not a man who skips a shave
but when he gets to them crawford is laser like holding the x ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it its here
he hands a startled investigator the film and strides off toward the giant open doors out to the airfield
his foot knocks a piece of the carefully laid out wreckage in passing it clatters across the concrete but crawford doesnt slow or look back
rob is still in the bed naked under the sheet watching jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit
what about dinner tonight
she looks at him surprised
smiles comes to sit beside him
gently we go out to dinner we might never come back
beat i want to wake up with you
i want to
he gropes for words but its too big and he relents scales back sighing at least see where you live
she regards him tenderly feeling the same reckless yearning
but also fear
she rubs his hair
she leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips
a black porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach pulls into a parking space
crawford gets out goes to a pay phone
he puts his cell phone on top of it drops in some change and dials
lieutenant nunally please
he listens to hold music and checks the time
he doesnt come on til six
you want his voice mail
beat ill see him later
he hangs up grabs his cell and takes off down the sidewalk
he knows where hes going past the front desk and outside to the jennifer swims laps with strong even strokes
rob is enjoying the sun in a lounge chair
crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low fence
unnoticed he heads upstairs
crawford stops at a room with a do not disturb sign on the knob
he takes out his pda device and slides its card into the key card slot of the lock
the lock clicks to green
crawford enters quietly closing the door behind him
he just stands there taking it all in
the unmade bed the ripped open condom packet the clothes on the floor
he is silent
jennifer drives her mercedes convertible past expensive houses in the late afternoon light
she goes up the driveway of the crawfords stark mordern home
across the street mr
gifford is playing catch with his grandson
he waves to jennifer
she waves back friendly but distracted on her way to the front door
metal planters with bamboo trees
glass doors out to a back garden
a fire in the fireplace
in a corner is another of crawfords rube goldbergs this one the size of a refrigerator
on a coffee table in the center of the room a big wooden bowl of ball bearings
jennifer hurries in dropping her keys on a table and freezes startled
crawford waits in the center of the room despite the outer disarray he is calm and focused
youre home early
i just felt a sudden urge
crawford shrugs smiling strangely
he looks pained
i could use a hug
jennifer submits guiltily
crawford embraces her tight
she waits it out until have you been drinking
he lets go and she steps back
ive been watching you sleep
gently thats creepy
sometimes when im at work ill start thinking about you and ill just get just overwhelmed
tommy its a dense crushing geophysical force
like im pinned
at the core where things change
beat you ever get that way about me jen
what are you talking about
im trying to describe my feelings
those dont sound like feelings
beat whats the sound of one feeling
in a forest
you think youre so much smarter than i am
that must make you feel very powerful
maybe its time to really talk
he shakes his head
frayed and worn she sighs
ill make you some dinner
he watches her turn and head for the kitchen
to her back i know
she stops exhales
grateful its happening at last
im so sorry
knowledge is pain
im used to that
jennifer winces feeling some sympathy
preparing herself to turn and end it to grow to move on
its not like i dont let little pleasures in return for the pain
she frowns and turns and her eyes go big with fear
crawford is holding a semi automatic pistol aimed at her face
the gunshot explodes out of the muzzle bright harsh loud
gifford and his grandson turn to look at the crawford house
crawford stands tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand
the hand we might notice now wears a surgical glove
he lowers the gun bends to pick up the ejected shell casing from the floor
he wipes it and tosses it aside on his way to jennifer
he stands looking down at her face up on the floor head in a small pool of blood eyes and mouth open
the doorbell rings
gifford leans on the frosted glass panel next to the door hands cupped around his eyes trying to see in
everything okay in there
crawford steps in from the living room
everybody just leave us alone
he calmly aims up at the frosted glass transom and fires three times watching gifford fling himself away
crawford collects the shell casings wipes them drops them back on the floor
peeling off the rubber gloves he crosses to the fireplace and throws them into the flames
they curl and blacken
crawford watches expressionless then looks around satisfied
helicopters overhead swat teams setting up
nearby houses have been emptied gawking neighbors and media vans moved back to a block away
uniform cops pull aside the barriers as a plain wrap sedan rolls through
it pulls up by the swat command truck
rob nunally gets out surveying the scene
the guy who spent his afternoon with jennifer crawford in the hotel is an l
you the negotiator
what do we know
crawford waits with the gun
the phone rings
he picks up yes
nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan wearing a kevlar vest now putting on his shoulder holster over it
into his cell phone mr
who is this
my name is lieutenant robert nunally
im a hostage negotiator for the los crawford hangs up
nunally grimaces shuts his phone shaking his head
but then he turns with the swat commander and everyone else as crawfords front door unlocks and opens a few inches
nunally considers this looks at the swat commander
here we go
he pulls his suit jacket back on then reaches into the trunk for his back up gun
he tucks it into the back of his belt concealed under the jacket
he takes a walkie talkie and starts for the house
the spectators fall silent
radios crackle and hiss as he heads up the driveway
crawford watches nunallys silhouette appear on the frosted glass from across the living room
the door pushes open very slowly
nunally stays in the doorway
crawford studies him staying back
get rid of the vampires
nunally is confused crawford gestures at the flood lit lawn outside
nunally glances back sees the swat teams and down the street the distant barricades the media
he nods steps in and lets the door shut
do i call you rob
if you want
nunally nods humoring him glancing around
sees the small pool of blood where jennifer fell
plays it cool
crawford what do you say you give me the gun so i can pay more attention to what youre saying
is that your best shot
beat so to speak
i just think maybe it would tell you what i will if you will
nunally frowns wary
crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room holds his gun out over it
we both put down our guns
at the same time
crawford gestures to a chair across the room by the foyer door near nunally
we set them down and step away
beat then you can pay more attention to what im saying
nunally studies crawford
and the gun hovering above the coffee table
looking for a trick a catch
but there isnt one
if crawford sets down his gun and steps away hell be standing in the open center of the room
happy ending then
nunally stares crawford in the eyes then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster
eyes on each other from across the room moving very slowly the two men cautiously set down their guns and step away
nunally smiles too reassuring and false
begins to edge forward alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon
but crawford stays absolutely still
crawford your neighbor mentioned that your wife its tom
you can call me tom
is she here
crawford gestures to a library alcove behind him out of view
is she all right
nunally begins to drift slowly to the side to see
i dont think she is
i shot her rob
nunallys nodding edging to look into the alcove you shot your wife
it was like i just suddenly snapped
we were arguing and i got the gun
okay i hear you and i shot her in the head
i know it was wrong
beat are you listening to me
but nunally is not
hes frozen staring shocked at the back wall of the alcove which he can now see
theres a big framed black white photograph a portrait of jennifer crawford
oh jesus christ
nunally fumbles for his walkie talkie rushing past crawford toward the alcove kneeling by jennifer who lies face up in a red puddle into walkie talkie we need a medic
get the ambulance up
nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse looking in her open vacant eyes for some sign oh no god no i cant get a nunally desperately starts c
his hands getting bloody
he stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then as crawford slowly approaches from the living room standing behind nunally
you know i think i read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery
its on the inner surface of the upper thigh
if you put your fingers you know right up inside her dress nunally turns and lunges up smashing a fist into crawfords face
crawford reels backward with nunally the two of them falling with nunally on top beating crawford furiously cursing as swat cops burst in grabbing nunally dragging him back knocking into
paramedics trying to get to jennifer nunally kicking flailing spitting at crawford whos put face down on the floor to get cuffed
nunally pulls free from the swat cops distraught angry going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder holster struggling to regain control
wait a second shes not dead
nunally whirls everyone freezing breathless falling silent
the paramedics kneeling around jennifer work as crawford lies on the floor staring at his wife
like shes a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations
jennifers stretcher is loaded into an ambulance doors slamming shut and sirens kicking on as crawford cuffed behind his back is pushed into the back seat of a police car
his eyes on the ambulance as it pulls away carrying his wife
a detective uses a pencil to lift crawfords gun from the coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag
nunally stands back watching the cops and technicians work the scene lost in his thoughts shaken
you all right
nunally wakes nods
to avoid talking more he heads out to the glaring lights and chaos outside
the alarm clock shifts to am and pops on to local news and traffic but the narrow futon bed is already empty
willy slocum works at a laptop on his second hand desk lit by a solitary lamp
he is in his late s good looking
short hair office pale but athletic wearing mis matched sweats from eastern oklahoma state college
he jots a final note sets his yellow legal pad aside
as he goes to the closet sized bathroom pulling off his sweatshirt and starting the tiny pre fab shower we linger on the laptop screen rental listings for a new
the bare overhead bulb is on revealing the concrete floor and painted plywood walls
his clothes hang neatly on a length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters
law school texts fill cinderblock and board shelves
the radio chatters
willy knots a tie in his crisp white collar
willy methodically packs legal folders from last nights homework into his big battered briefcase
he has to work to stuff all the files in
he pulls on his suit jacket settles the shoulders tugs at his cuffs
uncaps a pen leans over a one sentence letter waiting on the desk
reads it over
as he signs we glimpse hereby give notice that i will be resigning my position at the district attorneys office as of novemb willy savors the moment
then he tucks the letter into an envelope gets the heavy briefcase goes to shut off the light and open the door which swings about six inches then clonks into
peeks out goes to pound on a wall
shuts the door and presses a button near the light switch
theres mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly rolls up letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves
he presses the garage door opener button again and hurries across the apartment to duck out under the closing door
willy straightens and takes a breath re settling his suit jacket with an irritable glance at his landladys car parked sloppily next to the garage blocking his door
as he walks away down the alley we rise up to reveal the hazy sprawling landscape of l
and the towers of downtown rising ahead of willy like oz
come on phil i called you as a courtesy and you start looking to take advantage
an ancient fluorescent lit cubby crammed with documents case files notes reference books
willy on the phone im not knocking it down to a class c
my backlog of open cases does not mitigate the fact that your client tried to kill his brother in law with oh right a golfing accident
your client owns one golf club and no golf willy contd balls and the accident took place in the stairway of an illegal after hours gambling club
yeah okay ill see you in court
his cell phone rings
as he gets it well i wont see you in court but someone from this office will
you take it up with them i gotta go
switching phones willy slocum
oh hey hi yes
assistant district attorney norman chang mid s throws the door open without looking wooton sims
willy holds up a finger talking into his cell no i didnt
norman mouths wooton sims
repeatedly during no short notice is
no i can
he hangs up exhales slowly
looks at norman
please stop saying wooton sims over and over
its starting to sound like nonsense words
okay go back to wooton sims
as willy gets up and goes out past norman how the hell did you get a job at wooton sims
i cant even get an interview
norman follows willy out to a central bullpen area where the shared administrative assistants work mona and gladys
ive been here five years
im your supervisor
i graduated usc summa
were just going to pretend hes not talking okay
im really jammed up all day and i need to rent a tuxedo for tonight
oh come on
you are so full of shit
jotting notes there must be a place that does that right same day
im also gonna need a messenger to bring it here
this is my suit size and my shirt size
i really appreciate this
mona nods taking notes as willy gets out a credit card
other ddas are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks
whats going on
wooton sims buys a whole lot of seats to this charity opera thing every year because bob wooton is the chairman of this committee bob wooton
enjoying mock helpless its what the man told me to call him
youre gonna need to pick out a style willy
for the tuxedo
willy hesitates in over his head
a dda helpfully does the travolta finger in the air pose
i dont know i just dont want to look like im going to the prom
you wanna go classic
fix him up
well get you something classic
picks up a ringing phone willy slocums office
make sure it comes with cuff links and knee pads
oh thats very nice its good to be back in high school
hanging up willy
her tone makes him and everyone else turn
god wants to see you
beat our god
who art on the eleventh floor
willy startled looks around
approving nods raised eyebrows
he tightens his tie and heads for the elevators
there is no justice
there is no justice in the city of los angeles
district attorney joe lobruto ish sits behind a massive oak desk studying a thick file
doesnt look up as a secretary shows willy in
looks around hes never been here
flags wood panelling leather furniture windows overlooking the city
finally lobruto looks up takes willy in
william no middle initial slocum
as willy does eighty four percent conviction rate
with a case load thirty percent higher than any other first year dda
beat of course you also swapped more cases than the rest of them put together
willy considers his options
he always does
i offered my losing cases in exchange for two or three of anyone elses possible convictions
they couldnt handle their workloads and i prefer not to lose
lobruto knew this the question was would willy admit it
youre going to need a middle initial
youre going to wooton sims
in two weeks
youll be able to afford a better suit
but those guys all play squash and have middle names
they go in for the mothers maiden name a lot
willy doesnt like the implied personal judgement but the only way it shows is how calm he stays
my mother didnt have a maiden name
lobruto nods unruffled by willys hard calm
so youre a bastard sometimes i can be a son of a bitch
maybe you belong here
i didnt work this hard to stay where i belong
youre a street fighter willy
you should be in court
we can move you up to better cases
i appreciate the offer
i didnt think so
closes the file stands well you got your litigation experience
and your juicy private sector job
anything else the city of los angeles can do for you
he stands too
as they shake hands no i think thats everything thank you
the offer stands
if you get tired of carrying a spear
willy nods but lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes not getting it and trying to cover
lobruto smiles gently
its an opera joke
give my regards to bob
willys twisting in his rented tux trying to adjust a buckle on the side of the vest
the phone rings and he gives up frustrated pushing the plastic garment bag aside to answer knocking a full cup of take out coffee on to his chair
which is where he left his suit
watching the coffee seep into the fabric
into the phone distracted willy slocum
normans looking at a case file
ive got an attempted homicide
conley caught it last night but hes hung up in motions with gardner
arraignment in part seven at three oclock
three oclock is in fifteen minutes
whats the temperature
i cant do it
you do still actually work here willy right
i mean youre still going to be cashing your paycheck for another two weeks and everything
just get somebody else for this one
everybodys booked up
look its not going to trial
theres a weapon with prints and a confession
take the arraignment and wait for the plea
beat a real confession
spontaneous and signed
come on willy
looking down at his coffee soaked suit
heres the problem
norman slowly smiles listening
you know i really wish i was going to see this
willy slips self consciously through the double doors wearing the tuxedo
he gets even more self conscious when he notices a handful of local reporters
he hurries in passing nunally in the back row
nunally is making a good show of keeping it together
but its only a show
judge irene feldman ish looks over her half glasses
nice to see a man who dresses for court
sorry your honor
willy hurrying to prosecution table barely glances at the defense table but crawford sitting beside his public defender in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs never takes his eyes off willy
grapevine has it the punch line is wooton sims
good for you double oh seven
signaling the bailiff lets see what public service is offering you by way of a send off the state of california versus thomas crawford
the defense rises crawford hardly pays any attention to the judge glancing back and noticing nunally whose eyes bore into him haunted and burning
crawford stares at him impassively a second then turns to lean past his p
and watch willy hastily skim the file
crawford youve been charged with section slash of the california penal code attempted murder with additional allegations of assault with a deadly weapon penal code section dash a with great
bodily injury p
beat do you waive further reading of the complaint and complete statement of rights
sotto i do
but your honor you do
and do you wish to enter a plea at this time
but i also want to waive my right to counsel and represent myself
willy looks up from the file startled
do you have a problem with your appointed counsel mr
i just want to do it myself
i believe its within my rights
your honor if i could have a moment with my client im not your client
try and keep up would you
shuts up taken aback
the judge considers crawford thoughtful then turns to willy
do the people have an objection or a comment for the record mr
willy hesitates held by crawfords strange amused gaze
shakes it off im sorry your honor weve got the weapon and a signed confession
i really think mr
crawford needs a competent attorney to frankly negotiate a plea
crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an imaginary bow tie
willy self consciously touches where crawford indicated on his own collar straightens his clip on
crawford nods youre welcome
willy turns to the judge
i cant this was supposed to be with a pro se defendant this is going to drag out for months and im not even going to be here
the people request a continuance to excuse me
im willing to waive my right to a preliminary hearing and go directly to a jury trial
to willy does that help
you dont need to look out for mr
the district attorneys office can shift another prosecutor to the case no i like mr
he likes you
crawford seems to understand his rights and responsibilities
all due respect your honor im worried this may turn into some sort of a circus i appreciate your concern for the dignity of my courtroom mr
slocum considering youre making the argument dressed as a game show host
unfortunately the man is a tax paying citizen entitled by our constitution to try and manipulate the legal system like everybody else
turning judge feldman contd as for you mr
crawford i strongly urge you to retain counsel
lack of same will not be grounds for appeal
are the people ready to go to trial without a preliminary hearing
willy hesitates irritated
looks through the file again
checks crawford waiting polite
crawford smiles at him as the judge opens her calendar
willy in his tux comes out of a staircase and stops
rob nunally is waiting by willys parked car
youre supposed to be good
willy takes him in wary seeing an edge of anger and fear beneath the tough controlled cop manner
is that what im supposed to be
i asked around
youre supposed to be top notch but to me it looks like youve got one foot out the door and youre wiping the rest of us off the bottom of
the other one
im sorry to
nunally is silent frustrated
the concrete walls and ceilings echo from distant cars
i took crawfords confession
and now you want mine
im here to warn you
take this seriously because its serious
this guy is stone cold and his wife is lying in a hospital bed with brain damage
he struggles to keep himself under control
are you all right
are you gonna be on this or what
im on it
gently you got a confession
you took the gun out of his hand
im just telling you
is that okay
or are you too friggin busy
watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons
beat its a lock
put him down
nunally turns and walks away down a ramp
willy watches him go
like hes watching nunally drown
but hes seen people drown before
and hes not about to put out a hand
might get pulled in himself
willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing chatting sparkling formal dressed people
nikki gardner joins him strolling alongside
shes his age but her elegant dress unlike his tux was made for her
are you a shark
youve been circling the lobby for half an hour now like if you stopped youd die
if i stopped id be standing around with no one to talk to
at which point death would be a relief
why dont you talk to bob
willy stops walking getting a little careful
bob is talking to the governor
beat do i know you
she puts a hand out gently amused
senior associate wooton sims
shakes oh hey hi
it was your office that called with the invitation
on bobs orders
listen i dont
actually know bob
i mean ive only met the man once
nikki nods considering this
theyre each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction
the lobby lights flicker breaking the spell a little
as the crowd begins to drift toward the auditorium doors you like opera
truth is i havent really had that much expos neither do i
with a conspiratorial head tip nikki moves toward the plaza doors
they stroll the emptying plaza dressed to the nines
bob assigned you to my team
ill supervise your case work steer you through the office arcana and generally keep an eye on you
kind of like a mentor
kind of like a probation officer
willy nods meeting nikkis gaze as she looks to make sure hes got it
wooton sims expects absolute loyalty and a hundred and ten percent performance
but you get to work on legendary litigation
national sometimes global in scope
its high stakes
and cut throat even within the team
we burn out associates at an astonishing rate
youre trying to scare me
youre going to have to try harder
she stops walking
can i ask you something personal
who are you
willy doesnt answer
maybe uncertain what she means
maybe not wanting her to know
or even not knowing himself
we have a guy in our criminal division fresh out of yale named calvin tyler
one of our very rich clients gets pulled over d
which is routine bullshit so calvin gets it
next thing we know calvin is fired and bob wooton who has never even interviewed a junior associate before let alone hired one says youre on my team
willy weighs his options
decides to level it was a good bust so calvin came to me for a deal
i told him if he could arrange an interview for me with mr
wooton i would throw the case
i laid out his arguments and evidence for him and i showed him how i would lose
calvin set up my appointment for the day after our court date
then he did what i had suggested in court and i wiped the floor with him
your client got the maximum
next day i met with mr
you know whats brilliant about that
you didnt actually do anything all that wrong
well i wasnt entirely honest with calvin
his cell phone rings
he ignores it
you gonna get that
everyone i need to talk to is here
they are both feeling the electricity in the air between them
they wait the phone out enjoying the forbidden insanity of it
but then we need to talk about your transition timetable
bob believes in trial by fire
he wants you up to speed two weeks from tuesday because were getting on a plane to chicago for depositions in a class action against our biggest client armstead pharmaceutical
she studies willy trying to make sure he understands thats catch up on three years work and you havent closed out your old job yet
im good at trials
even by fire
you know a little bit of fear can be a very healthy thing to have
im looking forward to when i can afford the luxury of having some
nikki sighs smiles
enjoying him somewhat reluctantly
ill have them put the armstead materials in your new office
he watches her head off into the night
he remains alone in his tuxedo looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza
then he checks his cell phone
marchand senior s
scene investigation division tech works as he talks into a speaker phone
he and willy have teamed up often and an underlying respect lets them mock each other
its willy slocum
your gun in that palisades shooting is no good
how can the gun be no good
its a perfectly good weapon
a heckler koch nine millimeter
its just no good as evidence
its never been fired
its the gun from the scene
bought by mr
thomas crawford and registered to his wife about a month ago
apparently a gift
and between the shooting and arrest this guy was locked inside his house
is that a question
no i mean just whats the point
playing games with the gun
hes alone in the house with the victim and he confessed its not like the guns gonna get him off the hook
do you have a question i can answer
willy shakes the puzzle off irritated look our weapon is in that house somewhere
get a team out to search it tomorrow morning
sighs smiles thank you
he shuts the phone
takes a moment looking around again at where he is
absently tugs at his tie and vest lets the case go
heads in to the opera
a weeks work has emptied the shelves and cleared the surfaces but the file cabinet drawers are all half open willy sorts folders neatly marking and packing them
white trans file storage boxes are piled all over
willy looks up at a messenger with another file box
where do you want it
the idea here is were trying to take boxes out not bring more in
is that the idea
willy sourly gestures to a chair checks the label as the messenger sets it down whoa wait a second this is a screw up
i already have these documents
i sent this box to the defendant at county
i picked up at county
slip says bring em here
messenger holds out a clipboard
willy reluctantly signs
as the messenger leaves willy cuts the tape and takes out a folder
opens it crawford has scrawled no in red marker across the top sheet
willy turns to the next page
a big red no across that too
pulls out more documents flips through no no no no red letters wriggling across the typed pages like flip book animation
disturbed he picks up the phone dials
techs are taking the place apart opening hvac vents pulling books off shelves upending chairs and tables removing drawers from cabinets
marchand supervising answers his cell phone marchand
where are we on this gun
we cant find it willy
im in trial on monday
i dont know what to tell you
im there now
you said youd get a team out a week ago im here now
my team has been here twice already
beat do you really need it
do i need it
he takes a second
sighs exasperated but honest i dont know
defendants a whack job
he went pro se right
just when you think theyre not really stupid they defend themselves
youve got a confession and an airtight bunch of circumstantial
apologetic weve gone over this place top to bottom three times now willy
willy takes a breath
thinks it through
dont worry about it
beat sorry got a lot going on
must be rough figuring out what youre gonna do with all that money
hey i had to sit through an opera last week
oh gee lemme see if i can express how much sympathy i have marchand snaps his phone shut
willy smiles hangs up
but then his smile fades as he glances down again at crawfords box of papers
hundreds of pages
every single one scrawled no
willy considers them
crawford sits cuffed at a table waiting
looks up as the door unlocks
a guard lets willy in locks the door behind him
crawford watches willy take a legal pad files pens from his briefcase set them on the table
hows my wife
i dont know
i heard somewhere i think it was on n
that youre supposed to talk to people in a coma
play their favorite music
supposedly it reaches them
willy now ready lets crawford study him
you represent jennifer
the voice of the victim judicially speaking
but you havent gone to see her
too busy getting up to speed on armstead pharmaceutical
i beg your pardon
im not judging you
i think anyone coming from
what you came from then paying your way through east okie cowshit college and tulsa law by writing papers for princeton kids on the internet my god it must have
eaten your liver
sixty thousand dollars in debt eighty four percent conviction rate you deserve this
willy tries to stay in control
what the hell have you been doing
im permitted the use of a private investigator
not to investigate me
youre investigating me
you shot your wife
thats how it works right
if i cant introduce something in court as evidence it doesnt exist
look i dont want to play games with you
im afraid you have to
willy reconstructs his formal cool
takes some pages scrawled no from a folder pushes them across the table
is this some form of communication
you sent me a box of papers
its called discovery
the state has a legal obliga theres nothing in it willy
you havent discovered anything
have you found the gun
beat does it bother you that i call you willy
id like you to consider becoming my lawyer
ill pay you
a lot of money
im prosecuting you
yeah but im offering you a chance to get on the right side of this whole mess while you still can
are you out of your mind
i think on advice of counsel ill decline to answer that one
willy studies him
decides its an elaborate act
begins to put away his papers
i dont need the gun to convict you by the way
she was cheating you know
willy looks at him slightly taken aback
he didnt know it wasnt in the confession
as he considers whether it makes a difference he notices crawford watching enjoying
willy shuts his briefcase
it doesnt matter what she did
what you did is a crime
but maybe my so called peers will look at me and see themselves
and you and i both know willy that people have an infinite capacity for believing in their own innocence
take the stand
tell your story
id appreciate it
not to mention the fact you have no actual evidence connecting me to the crime
willy smiles gets up
except your confession
crawford watches him go to the door
my grandfather was an egg farmer
willy stops annoyed
is this gonna be about how you had a rough childhood
i used to candle eggs at his farm
you know what that is
you hold an egg up to a light and look for imperfections
beat the first time i did it he told me to put the ones that were cracked or flawed in a bucket for the bakery
beat he came back an hour later and there were three hundred eggs in the bakery bucket
he asked me what the hell i was doing
beat i found a flaw in every single one
thin places in the shell minuscule cracks
smiles look closely enough and youll find everything has a weak spot
where it can break
looking for mine
no ive found yours
crawford considers how to put it
youre a winner willy
willy pushes the call button by the door
jokes on me then i guess
ill see you in court mr
the door unlocks
willy hesitates for a second then leaves
its got a window
its got a sofa
undecorated except for a pile of materials boxes marked armstead willy is filling out forms tax citizenship benefits
he doesnt notice nikki when she comes to the door
make sure you sign the one with the devil in blood
its not binding otherwise
he looks up smiles
just want to be ready for chicago
im all closed out downtown
last trial starts monday
not pleased youve got a trial monday
yeah attempted murder
that gives you three days
you told me and i told bob that you would be ready to hit the ground r the man confessed
and hes pro se
willy some but acting as his own lawyer he could drag it out for months
you want to hear his witness list
willy is silent
willy leans in enjoying this part analyzing even admiring crawfords ploy its kind of clever this guy is trying to provoke the system into declaring him insane
i think he thinks well call in the doctors and he can fake em out by refusing the defense
hes acting out this really organized plan to appear crazy
nikki considers willy
youre gonna miss being in court arent you
he studies her confident
gestures to the stacks of armstead materials im almost halfway through these
and i think ive already found about six disqualifiers in delaware ohio and florida
i have to check case law in each state but it looks good
ill get the rest done over the long weekend
nikki sighs smiles a little against her will
hes won her over
willy shrugs grins
in the silence the impossible electricity returns
after a moment to defuse it you dont go home for thanksgiving
she studies him a moment thoughtful
if you want youre welcome at mine
smiling a little knowing her family and starting to know willy i think it would be interesting
okay thank you
willy doesnt go back to work right away
judge robinson presiding
a mid sized crowd including a few reporters
a uniform cop is in the witness box willy stands in the prosecution table
we established a perimeter around the house and then waited for swat and the negotiator
it was strictly by the book
so the house was completely surrounded within how long of the first shots
crawford sits alone at the defense table
he wears an expensive suit and no handcuffs but two deputies sit behind him
hes barely listening to the testimony drawing on his legal pad intricate dense complex diagrams of rube goldberg contraptions
maybe ten minutes
and when you arrived at the sc crawford noisily tears a page off his pad
looks up sees willy and everyone else turned to him
willy sighs returns to the cop
when you arrived on the scene was there a crowd
neighbors came out to look soon as it started
and from what you could ascertain no one went into or came out of the house until swat and the negotiator arrived
no further questions
crawford looks up from his drawing
your witness mr
crawford takes in the uniform cop
no questions for this witness
willy watches crawford return diligently to his doodles
its a mess of loose legal pad pages torn from crawfords pad each covered in madly intricate schematics
he works on yet another head down intent
marion kang is on the stand using a marker on a big diagram of a head through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe coming to rest against the back
of the skull
so this bullet inflicted serious injury
it inflicted serious and irreparable injury
willy nods allowing the jury time on this
he checks a note card glances at crawford
considers his options
kang is it safe to say that someone inflicting this kind of wound intended to kill
judge robinson gives willy a warning look
crawford you might want to object
the witness cant know your state of mind
crawford doesnt even look up from his drawing
no thank you your honor
willy gives judge robinson an i told you so shrug
turns to dr
i would say so yes
thank you dr
crawford tears off the page starts another
nunally on the stand
crawford draws ignoring him
so after you put down your gun what did mr
he confessed to shooting his wife
beat did mr
crawford appear confused or in any way intoxicated impaired
not at all
he knew what was going on
what did mr
nunally looks at crawford enjoying the fatal blow he said i got the gun and i shot my wife
god help me i shot her in the head
i know it was wrong
low still drawing objection
everyone turns surprised
im sorry mr
crawford did you say something
crawford sets aside his pen for the first time
i want to object
on what grounds
i dont know
your honor i dont know what youd call it
they it wasnt the first time either but i dont know the legal term
why dont you just explain it in laymans terms
fucking the victim
uproar in the court
crawford you said laymans terms your honor im sorry what would you call it legally when the officer who arrested you has been having sexual intercourse with your wife
willy whirls a look at nunally
the cop meets his eyes a deer in headlights
low oh shit
i think its objectionable maybe im wrong
nunally looks down silent
shaking his head
your honor the people request a nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail to attack crawford as the deputies leap forward to stop him all of them flailing
and cursing in a tangle spectators screaming fleeing gawking
the judge grim willy panicked crawford calm
he had my witness list
he should have filed to suppress
shrugs my mistake
crawford i warned you about representing yourself
what about the fact that its true
i mean isnt that the point here to get to the truth
slocum is it true
i dont know
i only heard about it five minutes ago
put him back on the witness stand if you dont believe me
we cant put him back on now
not after what the jury just saw
your honor i told you this would turn into a circus
first he provokes the witness with an outrageous allegation my dick has evidence
the judge and willy look at crawford like hes truly insane
i call him dick
i guess i should call him as a rebuttal crawford contd witness
hes got phone records credit receipts photographs videotapes all documenting the affair
in graphic detail
mildly dick is good
the judge looks at willy
this is bad
thinking fast okay um ill stipulate that my witness was less than forthcoming and that can more or less cancel out the fact that the defendant withheld a crucial mr
slocum your witness was intimate with the victim and he assaulted the defendant during the arrest
actually while obtaining my so called confession
willy stares at crawford shaken
understanding the trap
your honor hes got a point
they were alone in the house
the confession is no good
oh come on
is this a legal argument
oh come on
whirls on him you want to get into it
crawford raises his eyebrows
willy takes a deep breath
turns to the judge
beat he dictated and signed his confession after that incident
in police custody
arguably in fear for his life
im sorry mr
slocum its all fruit of the tainted tree
we have to exclude all versions of the confession and any evidence collected by lieutenant nunally or by other police officers on the night he was present
this is insane
its biblical isnt it
the fruit and the tree and he set this up
dont you see what hes doing
yes i do
and i dont like it
but its done so we have to deal with it
do you think i could go home today your honor
with thanksgiving around the corner dont push it mr
beat what were going to do is give mr
slocum a few days to regroup and come up with new evidence
if he doesnt then you can go home
thats going to put us into the long weekend
we reconvene monday morning
willy just stands there blind sided shell shocked
crawford smiles at him
the end of a bad bad day
willy flips on the lights as he comes in shaken
a package is on the empty desk
addressed in red marker
the return address tc county jail
willy just stands looking at it
crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit
as willy takes a letter opener from the desk drawer the phone rings
he answers it eyes still on the package willy slocum
crowded with upscale young professionals
nikki is on her cell phone hand over her other ear well youve gotta admire the cleverness of it
willy begins cutting open the package as he talks do i
crawford very slowly raises his eyes until he is looking directly at us
come on willy give the devil his due
im just trying to figure out what that is
okay then listen i checked with bob on how he wants you to handle this
nikki contd has lobruto tried to take you off the case yet
well he pretty much has to if hes gonna save any face
so heres the strategy you let him
willy cautiously lifts the boxs flaps pulls aside tissue paper to reveal a single eggshell
i let him
crawford begins to smile
yeah damage control
stop getting your face on tv
as it is i had to talk bob down from cancelling your contract
willy is staring down at the broken eggshell barely listening to nikki
but weve got to move fast and get out from under
otherwise and i quote stick a fork in this kids ass and turn him over hes done
i cant just walk away
willy today you got killed
the issue now is saving your new life
willy cant take his eyes off crawfords gift
that would be the smart way of looking at it
crawford stares right at us
nikki is sympathetic misunderstanding willys quiet you want to come out and get drunk
ive got some stuff to take care of
dont beat yourself up
he hangs up
considering the empty eggshell
but then he looks up district attorney lobruto is in his office doorway trying to decide whether to be angry
you dont look into who the victim was sleeping with
willy burns ashamed
but unable to admit it
he threw me off
frustrated look crawford knew hed be the prime suspect so he gave us everything but he made it all radioactive
the night this went down it was over
but you still walked it into court willy
we might not have a case
but it didnt have to be a public humiliation for this office and the police department
are you taking me off
youre leaving anyway
im starting to get a sense of this guy
thats not new evidence
i can take him now he thinks hes smarter than i am
its not about you willy
yeah it is
he made it that way
shows him the egg he likes me
what is that some kind of oklahoma insult
let me do this
i wont make you look bad
thats what i need to make sure you understand
i remove you now im covered i took some action
beat if you go on with this when you lose blame has to come down
and itll come down on you
ill have to investigate you for improprieties incompetence anything i can
ill hang you out to dry
for the good of this office
if i lose
you said when
he shakes his head
local news on the tv willy pushing past media outside the courthouse official photo of nunally footage from the standoff at crawfords
the sound is low and nunally isnt watching
hes sitting on the edge of the bed
looking down at his gun in his hands
a knock on the door wakes him
he sets the gun aside goes to peek out the curtains
lets willy in
youre not easy to find
i had to call internal affairs
yeah they put me on a desk til this gets
he uncomfortably watches willy glance around at the half empty liquor bottle the mismatched suitcases and paper bags full of balled up clothes
and the gun on the bed
got home my wife already took the kids to her folks
press is all over our front lawn
he falters haunted by the echo
willy doesnt notice what the hell were you thinking
youre on the job and you get called to your girlfriends house i didnt know it was her house
id never been there
it was her name
i didnt know her name
nunally explains reluctant to expose himself no last names
we met at the same hotel room twice a week no phone calls no questions
she didnt want us to know too much about each other
she said it was like
travel in a foreign country
no baggage from our lives
did you get the feeling she had rules because she had done it before
with other guys
i dont know
thinking remembering no
it was all just this
for both of us
we didnt expect that when we started
we didnt know where it was going
i had cheated so many times i was numb but she was new
and she made me feel like there was some chance
we were scared
it was like we were afraid to go forward but we couldnt go back
beat you always think you have time
to work it out
or make things right
angry what was i supposed to do
you were supposed to tell me
i have kids
you thought nobody knew so maybe you could just walk away clean
i didnt think he knew
i thought it was just massively fouled up
like god telling me something
anguished im there
my mind is going crazy
i know the confession wont hold if anyone finds out
beat i thought the guy was a whack
well hes not
nunally wont look at willy
he just sits there numb
is there anything else you can give me
anything that might get us some evidence
nunally shakes his head
goes to the door
tried to warn you
you warned me he was smart
you didnt warn me you were stupid
willy feels a little badly
two guys in a shabby motel room in terrible trouble
how do we get the confession back in
what are you gonna do
willy shakes his head
a massive search is under way
team has been doubled back up by a dozen passing hand held metal detectors along the furniture taking pictures down from the walls turning over mattresses patting down every item
hanging in the closets wriggling into crawlspaces poking into light fixtures recessed into the ceilings opening the air conditioning unit up on the roof ripping out crawfords high end home theater system taking apart the porsche in the garage
willy paces the edges of the action restless edgy
willy stops in the doorway watching a deputy shut the stainless steel freezer open a wired glass cabinet and poke around
shake the boxes
the cereal boxes shake em
and theres a chicken in the freezer
thaw it out check inside
the deputy stares like hes nuts
willy doesnt blink
the deputy goes to shake the boxes eyes on willy okay
hours have passed
willy steps out of the front door because hes going stir crazy inside
stands watching two techs walk the lawn and flower beds with metal detectors
he notices past the s
vans and sheriffs dept
black and whites parked in the driveway nunally in his parked car across the street
he meets willys eyes
willy cant give him any news
so he pretends he didnt see the question in nunallys eyes looks away
takes a breath turns and goes back in to work
its getting dark out
techs pack equipment cases carry them out
the place is a disaster area
marchand watches willy pace the living room
and the tool shed and the roof and the h
what about the door frames
what did he do rip open a door frame hide the gun inside and re plaster the wall before swat showed up
what about the neighbors property
he could have thrown it over the hedges
beat he might have passed it off to somebody willy
had an accomplice waiting out the back
willy shakes his head grim
this isnt an accomplice sort of guy
looking across the room at the big rube goldberg device
as he moves toward it this is a
guy who likes to show off
he examines the intricate workings eyes travelling the clutter of metal and wires and motors
checks marchand who shakes his head
fuming relentless its a physical object
it cant just vanish
were missing something some step in the story
he begins walking through the crime the stations of the cross re enacting it starting from the front door methodical reciting it to himself the neighbor sees her get home
hes already inside
she lets herself in
a minute or two later blood pattern says shes standing over there hes somewhere around here
willy stands where crawford was
raises a finger gun
as willy goes to where jennifer fell but then he carries her back there
willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood because hes gonna need time
when shes alone with the cop
willy stops in the alcove looking down at the dried blood the discarded paramedic supply wrappers
neighbor comes to the door
willy nods comes out crosses to the foyer crawford shouts leave us alone and fires three more rounds boom boom boom
so everybody knows hes dangerous and she might still be alive
so theyll call the negotiator
beat now hes got about ten minutes
and thats it
he stands there with the imaginary gun in his hand
trying to think like crawford
im sorry willy
willy wont respond because accepting the apology means admitting hes got nothing left
the house is empty
except for willy turning on lights as he gets to each room turning them off as he leaves
do you dare stay out
do you dare go in
studying framed photos jennifer now and then with crawford in italy bermuda colorado
always a bit posed and formal when theyre together
and if you go in should you turn left or right
or right and three quarters
or maybe not quite
checking the contents of the medicine cabinet
you can get so confused that youll start in to race down long wiggled roads at break necking pace no longer really looking for the gun
hes looking for insight
a way in
willy wanders through jennifers spacious dressing room
and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space headed i fear toward a most useless place
he idly surveys the vanity cluttered with cosmetics skin care products
lifts her perfume sniffs
the waiting place
for people just waiting
waiting for a train to go or a bus to come or a plane to go notices a storage box on the floor left partly open in the search
he shifts the lid aside
or the mail to come or the rain to go or the phone to ring or the snow to snow a high school yearbook
an old photo album
a teddy bear
a snow globe
a well worn book by dr
or waiting around for a yes or no or waiting for their hair to grow
everyone is just waiting
willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life
the room is dim and silent except for the hiss click of the respirator the monotonous beep of the heart monitor
waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite or waiting around for friday night or waiting perhaps for their uncle jake jennifer crawford lies
with her head wrapped in gauze eyes shut plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape
willy sits beside her bed reading dr
seuss or a pot to boil or a better break or a string of pearls or a pair of pants or a wig with curls
or another chance
he stops reading a moment
watching her what are you doing
a work weary resident comes past him to check the i
s and monitors
hes about willys age
i heard it might help if somebody talked to her
who told you that
reluctantly the man who shot her
the resident looks up at willy who shrugs uncomfortable
is there any chance
she might come out of this
are you a member of the family
getting out id sorry
im with the district attorneys office
beat we dont have any other witnesses
this woman had a bullet plow through her brain
but you hear about people waking up from comas
after everybody said pull the plug they wake up
beat you hear stuff like that all the time
you hear about elvis and aliens too
all the time
its not impossible though
i mean why else are you keeping her like this
the resident sighs
its not impossible
but even if she did she might not remember how to talk let alone anything about how she was shot
when i was here alone before she moved a little
are you just going to keep asking the same question in different ways until you hear the answer you want
thats how it works with the law
i knew i should have gone to law school
willy watches the resident go out
then he looks back down at jennifer
listening to the machines
tina the assistant waits in the doorway
hes trying to conceal the fact that hes on a fishing expedition
so this is all exactly how he left it
browses a wall of framed photos crawford at crash sites universities engineering test labs awards certificates articles from industry publications lauding crawford as the go to guy for investigating mechanical
failures of aircraft
and he was distraught
he was drinking
the past few weeks
but he was working on this
he stands over unfinished rube goldberg device
tools laid out on the work table meticulous organized
all distraught and everything
its not evidence
do you want coffee
he said i should ask
willy turns a little rattled
tell him i said no thank you
the room where jennifer and nunally met
cleaned up now anonymous empty
willy stands looking at it
theres nothing to see
he grimaces nods heads out past the assistant manager waiting in the doorway
as willy comes out of the room he slows noticing the little gray plastic surveillance camera ball in the ceiling
how long do you keep the tapes
willy considers it
hes got nothing else to try
can i get a copy of october th
ill have it for you friday
im kind of under the gun here
were short staffed tonight and tomorrow
seeing willys confusion thanksgiving
willy nods trying to pretend he hasnt forgotten right
a faux tudor hancock park dining room
wealthy but lived in
judge lewis gardner your basic henry fonda jimmy stewart type patriarch carves a turkey at the head of a long table wearing a worn and gravy splattered apron
platters circulate in both directions among nikkis older siblings burton and sandra their spouses their children
willy sits next to nikki who is high stylish despite the fact that shes dressed casual
white or dark willy
anything is fine your honor
im off duty you can call me lew
while gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it so is everyone in this family involved in the law
well nikkis not
to willy burtons a counsel for sierra club and sandras aclu so they use the holidays as an opportunity to give me a hard time because i can buy and
were not actually for sale nick
nikki gives willy a did i tell you
nicole decided early on that black sheep was the most effective role in which to distinguish herself from her siblings
you know of any other family in america where the corporate lawyer whos going to make partner by thirty five is the black sheep
well you may be lost beyond recovery but maybe we can still convince willy that defending giant corporations against injured citizens is not the best use of his skills
i dont think so sir
smiles its where the money is
scolding mildly i believe that phrase refers to banks
and it was coined by a thief
willy remains polite but wont back down
times have changed
to willy you dont have to do this
i dont mind i get this kind of thing now and then
to gardner almost always from people with money
appearances can be deceiving willy
i grew up with eight brothers and sisters on a farm up in fresno and i promise you i saw my share of hard times
willy considers his options
my mom odd fairly frequently so they put me in a group home
my younger sister is dead and my older brother is doing twenty five to life
willy looks down begins to eat again
i usually do
i see that
i dont know if you will against the wife shooter though
the click of silverware
willy looks up at burton steady
its not over til its over
that looked pretty over
anyway willys been taken off the case
it might not seem like it now but thats a blessing in disguise willy
to nikki uncomfortable i wasnt
nikki looks at willy
doesnt make any sense
lobruto has to do some kind of damage control i asked him not to
nikki is staring at him
you are really stupid did you know that
willy doesnt know how to handle this everyone else tries to be polite eating and pretending not to notice
im getting new evidence where
the evidence store
oh thats right they open early the day after thanksgiving
youre gonna be fine
did it ever occur to you i might be good enough to still win
the man shot his you wanted corporate right
you wanted to play in the big leagues
yeah im just you go to all that trouble getting yourself in and then you just pay no attention to wh look im sorry can we not talk about this
refusing to look around
ashamed at losing control turns back to her food fine
everyone eats in silence a moment then nikki tosses down her napkin i need to talk with you
she gets up and walks out of the room
with an awkward glance around willy excuses himself and follows her
look im sorry i didnt tell you did you hear me when i said bob wanted you gone as soon as this thing broke
did you hear me say i went out on a limb to convince him wouldnt it be better than damage control if i actually turn it around
and what if you dont
willy has no answer
he doesnt think that way
and she sees that
she sees a young man from oklahoma in way over his head
desperate to get through you dont get it at all do you
you pulled a stunt to get yourself this job
fine youre a hot shot
beat wooton sims does not need hot shots
because you dont win
the firm wins
nikki contd beat and you just put yourself head to head in conflict with bob
shaken what am i supposed to do
we told the man youre getting on a plane to chicago tuesday
nikki watches him dealing with it sympathetic
the impossible feelings always running under the surface for them have developed a darker aching tone
if anything stronger
i think maybe im gonna go now
beat call if you want
neither one moves
judge gardner enters cautiously from the dining room breaking the spell
nikki nods goodbye to willy and goes out quickly without meeting her fathers eye
ive got some work to do
i need to call a cab
gardner nods respectfully but doesnt move quite yet
studying the torn up young man
you know what nobody understands about certain kinds of underpaid public service work
now and then you get to put a fucking stake in a bad guys heart
were not supposed to talk about that when we visit a third grade class on career day and it doesnt get you very far into the country club locker room
but its hard to beat when you actually get to do it
willy looks at the kindly old judge a little surprised
gardner shrugs my two cents
he goes to a side table finds the yellow pages
willy lets himself in
he looks for the light switch finds only a complex computerized dimmer panel
he tries it
accent lights come on buried in the living room planters
he cant get any other pre sets to work
the crime scene is creepy lit like that
the dried blood is black
shadows stretch up the walls strange
willy grimaces moves through it sees another panel by the french doors to the garden
goes over and jumps back startled shit
by nunally on the other side of the glass
catching his breath willy stares
he unlocks the french doors and nunally steps in uneasy haggard
the hell are you doing here
nunally looks around taking a pint bottle from his overcoat pocket uncapping it
we need to talk
he drinks then offers the bottle
willy hesitates takes it
as he drinks we have to find the gun
willy winces at the liquor and the remark hands back the bottle
thank you professor einstein
it would also be good to find a couple of willy contd eyewitnesses
if one could be the dalai lama it would be even better
no willy we need to find the gun
ive had three different teams here he didnt leave between the shooting and when we took him out in cuffs
the gun is here
beat so we have to find it
well we cant
you want to move on
nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat willy catches it
a heckler koch nine millimeter in a plastic bag
willy stares down at it
then at nunally who holds up a bullet deformed by impact
theres a guy in the evidence room owes me a favor
well its not so much a favor as i know stuff about him
he can trade this for the bullet from jennifer give us a ballistic match
its a crime
so whos gonna get away with a crime this asshole or us
tosses the gun back
what else have you got
ill find a way
no you wont
willy watches nunally stalk out through the big strangely lit room
the front door opens and slams
a little worried willy takes a deep breath
gets to work
he still has three days to break this open
walking through the crime again
playing it out in his mind
standing in different places getting different perspectives
willy stands in the alcove
theres something here
but he cant get it
his eye falls on the rube goldberg device
moves closer peering into the mechanism
turns away no gun
but now hes facing the big wooden bowl of ball bearings sitting out in the middle of the room on the coffee table
hide in plain sight
he walks over pushes his fingers in feels around
takes a ball bearing rolls it in his hand
goes to the device drops the ball in the slot
the machine is amazing
the ball rolls and leaps and clatters lights flash elevators rise and fall at one point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air then it spirals out of
sight and reappears somewhere unexpected until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails across the living room to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table
this guy is really good
a mess of courtroom exhibits copies of evidence lists depositions photos diagrams take out food containers and coffee cups
marchand surveys it
the bleary end of a long day sifting clues dead ends
theres nothing here
willy has barely slept all weekend
he shakes his head reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a vcr tv stubborn
guns dont just walk out of crime scenes
marchand waves copies of crawfords evidence stills printed from home video dick took at a hostage negotiation nunally doing his job his methods his routine
two months before he shot his wife this guy had his investigator watching the cop at work
he knew exactly how it would go down and he didnt leave any loose ends
then what is this willy uses the remote
on the tv in black and white jennifer and nunally come out of their room and head for the pool indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on
fast forward until he slows it crawford comes to let himself in
from that day
he was there
marchand watches over willys shoulder
had to see it for himself
they were out at the pool
the unmade bed
mans gonna shoot his wife in the head he needs to get himself all worked up
willy stares at the grainy black and white figure emerging from the room walking away down the corridor
marchand gets his jacket pulls it on
willy go home
tomorrow you go back into court and take your lumps then you start your cushy new life and you forget all about this one
hoping to get a smile and then you can lend me money and shit
willy says nothing
runs the tape back and then slow motions it forward again
marchand goes out
leaving willy alone watching crawford
willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out on his narrow futon
walking the scene again on paper
the whole apartment is an array of law books notes exhibits marked up depositions
hes staring at evidence hes already stared at a hundred times
he grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets a dull moan rising into a yell as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper
throwing books tearing up printouts pulling out drawers emptying them smashing them on the desk yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse his shabby garage apartment is trashed and hes sitting exhausted in his chair
theres a knock on the door
willy frowns checking the clock its two thirty a
he goes to open it revealing nunally standing in the darkness a haunted shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to jennifer crawford
in the tool shed taped to the blade inside the lawn mower
before willy can say anything nunally walks away
willy doesnt move
watching the tormented cop disappear down the alley
willy in a clean suit and crisp suit carrying his briefcase hurries through paying no attention to the secretaries and other d
s who watch like hes on his way to his own execution
at his office door he gestures for mona to come in with him
surprised she gets up taking with her an envelope with a messenger receipt taped to the front
mona watches willy shut the door behind her
hesitates can i ask you to do something for me this morning
write down your cell number
as she does once my trial is in session wait outside
i might call and just hang up
if i do i want you to come into court and whisper to me that we got a tip about the murder weapon
you found it
i havent decided yet
mona studies willy then accepts its dont ask dont tell hands him her number
willy nods grateful
turning for the door she remembers the envelope in her hand
oh this came for you
he takes it and as she leaves checks the return address wooton sims
willy grimaces opens it
inside are an airline ticket to chicago first class and a handwritten note on wooton sims stationery we only win the favor of the gods by making a sacrifice see
you tomorrow nikki he stands in his empty office considering the ticket and the note
willy steps off the elevator into a crowd of reporters and spectators outside the courtroom
hes startled for a moment its worse than he expected the dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes tracking him like hes walking into an
arena a freakshow performer but he doesnt slow ignoring the comments and questions avoiding eye contact until he sees nunally by the courtroom doors his eyes fixed on willy
willy meets nunallys gaze
moving on giving back nothing
nunally watches willy disappear into the courtroom stares at the closing doors uncertain on edge
lost no matter which way this goes
gifford the crawfords neighbor is on the stand
willy questions him standing by the prosecution table
behind him the court is standing room only
reporters sketch artists spectators
nunally sitting near the front
lobruto standing at the back
crawford writes intently on a legal pad filling pages with dense scribble
so between the time you heard the first gunshot and called and the time of mr
crawfords arrest you had the crawford house in view
i was very concerned about jennifer
she was a lovely woman
no one but thomas crawford came in or out
thank you mr
no further questions
crawford glances up at the judge
then at gifford as if hes just noticed him up there
without getting up did you see the guy run out the back door
the other guy
the one who shot my wife
did you see him run out the back of the house carrying the gun
willy closes his eyes
i couldnt see the back of the house
trying to salvage it i believe
the police went around back when they arrived
no further questions
willy immediately stands re direct your honor
but crawford is standing too with his handful of pages ive also written a motion to dismiss
objection im on re direct
the judge hesitates
both men standing
on what grounds mr
the prosecutor doesnt have any actual evidence
im in the middle of presenting all of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts that my wife was shot and that i was tragically in the
house at the time a witness and in a way a victim myself
ill stipulate to mr
slocums entire witness list right now a request a directed verdict or dismissal per california versus collier and the appellate court decision v
willy stares at crawford stunned
as the judge reluctantly nods to the bailiff to collect crawfords pages and opens a law book your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend mr
while the judge checks the citations crawford glances at willy
willy looks down reaches into his briefcase moves his cell phone out from under some papers
to where he can get it easily
looks back up at crawford
willy and crawford turn to the judge
have you got any new evidence
may i have a moment your honor
the judge nods
willy nods down
trying to focus
hes got nothing and everyone in the room knows it
he can hear it he can feel it
theres a restless hungry edge to the crowded courtroom
he stares into his open briefcase the cell phone
next to it the first class ticket and nikkis note
willy glances back at the gallery
nunallys eyes burn into him
in the back lobruto frowns concerned
willy turns back to his briefcase
press the menu button selects speed dial
on the tiny screen a list of names
selected mona cell
mona sits on a bench a few steps down the corridor from the courtroom doors
cell phone in her hand
willy stands at the prosecution table
hearing his own pulse
crawford studies willy curious
can we signal the prosecutor from here on planet earth
willys fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad
press and a path is chosen
possibly for life
next to the cell phone the ticket and the note
see you tomorrow
nunally sits forward
lobruto is watching intently
willy doesnt move
now or never
willy wont look up
nunally stares agonized
willy grimaces slightly as if he feels his soul burning up turning to ash and blowing away nods closing the cell phone sliding it under nikkis note
shuts the briefcase
looks at the judge
i have no further evidence at this time your honor
crawford begins to smile
lobruto looks down
a buzz rises in the gallery as nunally gets up furious stalks to the doors slams out
judge robinson looks at willy a moment then at crawford who has been waiting calm and polite
very reluctantly motion to dismiss is granted
the judge bangs his gavel order
the jury is released with our apologies practically shouting over the chaos reporters hastily heading for the doors pulling out cell phones and the defendant is free to go
crawford gives the judge a gentlemanly bow of the head
willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase
refusing to look up
the judge and the bailiff might be saying other things but no one is listening spectators swarm up the aisles out to the hallway and the court starts to close
crawford comes over to willy holds out a hand
willy looks him in the eye
even a broken clock gets to be right twice a day
he winks and heads up the aisle
as willy watches crawford go out the doors into a clamor of lenses hand held mikes white hot halogen glare and flashes he hears a buzzing noise
looks down at his briefcase moves the papers aside his cell phone is vibrating
willy stares at it as if hed forgotten the thing could be used for an incoming call
the caller id reads wooton sims
he picks up nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the windows behind her
its an effort hey
what did you think i wasnt keeping tabs
i dont know what i thought
she tries to get past it listen what do you say i take you out tonight and get you completely trashed
tomorrows just a travel da theres a gun shot outside the courtroom
screams and shouting in the corridor
hang on we move with willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the doors faster pushing out into the echoing chaos of the corridor trying to move in
the crowd shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered around a figure lying on the floor
willy pushes closer until he catches glimpses of nunally
lying on the marble floor
his gun in his lifeless fingers
blood all over from his head
willy stops pushing
wont let himself look away the screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur
then suddenly willy looks up as if hes been called to find crawford standing very still in the crowd on the other side of the body
everyone else is moving talking gawking at the body or averting their eyes except crawford
hes looking straight at willy
willy stares into crawfords eyes
the life support system clicks and hisses and beeps
jennifer is curled into a fetal position despite the tubes and wires
willy sits by her bed
still in his suit from court the jacket off the tie loose
hes been there a while
but now he speaks
your husband said something
that i cant seem to shake loose of
he said im a winner
beat and hes right
i cant lose
i cant stand people who lose
beat i may have been working so hard to put some distance between me and
people like you that maybe i messed up
i dont know if did anything wrong
or what i should have done
i really dont know any more
what im supposed to do
beat but i feel like i let you down
somehow in the
and if i did im sorry
i just i hope you
he feels stupid
takes a breath
looking at her pale drawn comatose face
he stands goes to get his jacket lying folded on a table by the door
pulls it on settles the shoulders tugs at his cuffs
gets his briefcase
he goes to the door and as he opens it he looks back
jennifers eyes are wide open
shes staring at him
willy stands breathless watching her
sliding glass doors suck open willy walks with the resident from the other night she was looking at me
yeah i understand no she was looking at me
a beam of light slides across it
the resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket draws a pin from his lapel
gently sticks jennifers cheek
willy winces watching
the resident ignores him
pricks her forehead her chin her big toe
each time she twitches
he runs his thumb along the sole of jennifers bare foot
it arches up
the normal reflex goes downward
up indicates brain trauma
shes in there
she was looking at me
the resident sighs
sympathetic but plain sometimes we have to tape their eyes shut
they all move they make sounds they twitch
you think theyre dreaming
but theyre not
its just whats left of the system sending broken signals
can we do other tests
like an m
and i want a coma specialist to see her
youre not authorized to order tes ill get you authorization
first thing tomorrow
the resident studies willy
reluctantly you get the paperwork ill do what i can
willy nods grateful
as the resident heads out willy sits by jennifers bed protective intent
crawford comes in through the lobby rested well dressed
a free man
he slows surprised seeing willy come off the elevators
willy hasnt left jennifers bedside
hes in the same suit and carrying his briefcase from the courthouse
this isnt like you at all
you havent got anything to gain
thats my weak spot
beat ever think about what yours might be
of course i have
leans in the truth about me is willy
im really not very nice
concealing the ace up his sleeve
you sure do know a lot though
got everybody all figured out everything set up like one of your contraptions
then you just sit back and watch it all fall right where you want it to
must be kind of
at that point
not an ounce of sympathy willy
beat imagine it imagine she was yours
and you knew you were losing her
beat imagine days
going through her desk
staring at her clothes
knowing this is what it will be like
beat do you have any idea how hard it was to go on living with her every day knowing
but you had to right
you needed time to set it all up
your crime of passion
there are many kinds of passion willy
beat so thank you
starting to feel wary
willy sees it
for sharing your wisdom
all your little helpful bits of information
beat you were right
talking to her
he goes past crawford and out the doors
crawford doesnt move except to turn and watch willy
uncertain for the first time since weve met him
willy still unshaved unslept in yesterdays suit comes off the elevator fishing out id as he passes a receptionist hi im just going directly to the key card slot by
the glass double doors to the rest of the floor
he swipes his card and pulls the handle but it stays locked
willy swipes his card again
excuse me im new i just started and theres something wrong with my card
can you buzz me in
who are you here to see
i work here
im new he stops realizing how he must look
willy slocum for nikki gardner
as he calls in willy sees nikki through the doors one of a half dozen associates trailing in the wake of bob wooton
they all carry expensive business luggage except wooton who is powerful perfectly groomed and two decades older
wait a second never mind here she is thank you
willy goes toward the glass doors as wooton comes through nodding deferentially to the boss semi apologetic hey
bob to nikki can i talk to you for a second
wooton glances back at nikki eyes saying dont take long
she nods as wooton and the team continue to the elevators staying back by the glass doors to talk with willy you let him know what happened last night
i told him
great who do i work with on it while youre gone
you dont work with anyone
nikki the man has power of attorney and a health care proxy he can disconnect her life support whenever he wants
if we dont move fast nikki explodes but quietly not wanting the team to hear jesus willy wake up
what is wrong with you its first year law that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it nikki contd wouldnt matter
you cant take him back into court
i told you we bring a civil suit youve got no standing
it doesnt have to stick we just need to get a court order for now to keep crawford from pulling the plug
with all the brain power here im sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor
then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state appointed conservatorship so we can protect her while we fight him on whats the point willy
because shes drawn a line in the sand
one he already crossed without truly understanding
and now hes standing out there alone feeling the sand slither away under his feet
this man is going to kill his wife
beat what does that have to do with wooton sims
willy just breathes
vulnerable like we have never seen him before
he looks across the big reception area at wooton and the team of associates
some look away
i warned you
no this is insane
its what it is
nikki grimaces frustrated and sad i warned you
she starts for the elevators willy following youre not really just gonna let this happen are you
oh im supposed to lose my job over your problems
wait a second this is not about my anything any more willy grabs nikkis arm to stop her turn her around and she shoves him away hard tears welling in
her eyes willy letting her go as the receptionist quietly calls for help and nikki hurries into the waiting elevator
the associate holding the doors lets them go
this is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a womans life
the doors begin to close
willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits their expressions ranging from pity to contempt except nikki whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger
as the doors shut across them
willy doesnt move
confused humiliated frustrated
he turns when a bunch of other lawyers emerge from the offices ready to act as bouncers
people gawk from behind the glass doors
willy holds up his palms
i got it
he bangs open the paddle sign on the stairway door setting off the fire alarms as he stalks out
willy runs down the stairs furiously the clanging alarm several floors above now a little fainter
he suddenly stops clinging to the railing bent over
he sways dizzy gasping backs up until hes against the concrete wall
presses himself against
listening to his own ragged breathing
scared out of his mind
crawford stands by the bed glancing over a set of forms on a metal clipboard
lunt a senior neurologist and a hospital administrator wait
the machines hiss and click keeping jennifer alive
crawford signs the forms expressionless
willys walking alongside judge robinson as they leave the building
the judge is wearing his civilian clothes
what do the doctors say
people wake up out of these things
what did the doctors say mr
theres no way to really know
im trying to get them to run more tests but i was there and im telling you
i have no probable cause to issue a court order against mr
crawford and hes protected agai the judge stops giving willy a hard eye im sympathetic but yelling at me is not a smart approach
willy looks at the judge a second hapless frustrated scared then nods and shakes his head and turns away hurrying off through the homeward bound crowds
the judge watches him go
crawford is carefully preparing an elegant solitary meal
music plays on his state of the art sound system
he stops noticing a pair of jennifers reading glasses folded up by a note pad and pen next to the telephone
he picks them up
he goes to the trash steps on the pedal to flip open the lid and drops the glasses in
goes back to cooking
lobruto at the dinner table with his family looks up surprised as the doorbell rings
he excuses himself goes to open the door
willys outside apologetic but urgent near the end of his rope
im sorry but nobody else seems to give a damn that sooner or later this guy is gonna finish what he started
have you been home at all today willy
willy looks down at himself hes unshaven in the same rumpled clothes he wore to court yesterday
exasperated no ive been trying to get some theres a court order out against you
a restraining order
beat you were at the hospital
talking to her doctors
lobruto looks out at the confused frantic young man truly sorry that he cant help willy fight his way back toward doing some good in this mess
crawford hired a lawyer this time
they saw judge gorman this afternoon
you need to stay away from him and his wife and the hospital
he can have you arrested if you dont
beat im sorry
beat i cant help you
i told you how it would go
willy stares a second slowly understanding his situation
can you do anything for her
i dont see how
we move with willy out to the quiet street
the windows of the houses he passes seem warm and safe and very far away
behind him lobruto watches from his lighted doorway
willy walks shaken determined into the night
a nurse checks jennifer crawfords vital signs
she then begins to gently wash jennifers face where its not taped or bandaged
the monitor beeps the ventilator hisses
crawford knots his necktie studying himself in the mirror
judge gardner pulls his car out to the street swerving hastily as willys car skids alongside and forces him to the curb horn honking
willy pulls to a stop blocking gardners way and gets out of the car holding up both palms just wait
lunt takes a chart from the i
crawford been prepared
crawford drives wearing a dark suit sunglasses
willy watches gardners secretary bring in a document fresh off the laser printer
as gardner signs can i use your fax machine
these have to be served in person
willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a driver wrangling with the booth guy
he grimaces looks around backs up tires squealing heading for another exit
lunt stands by jennifers bed supervising the nurse and an orderly as they prepare her
crawford walks in goes toward the elevators
he floors it racing under a light going red narrowly misses getting broad sided
lunt looks up from making notes on jennifers chart as crawford enters the room
willy pulls into a no parking zone and jumps out papers in hand tossing the keys to an orderly smoking a cigarette move it if you need to
running through the automatic doors
standing beside dr
lunt crawford watches expressionless as the nurse and the orderly work efficient and silent disconnecting the oxygen tubes unplugging the monitor willy dodges people coming to the elevators which open
willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs comes out of the fire stairs hurrying toward i
and into jennifers room where he stops
the bed is being stripped the equipment rolled out
willy stares breathless overwhelmed
you just missed her
she just went on up
willy struggles to control his emotions
how long ago
did she die
beat the roof
beat nurse contd medevac transfer
out to a long term care facility up in santa barbara
they just left you can probably still catch em
willy tries to understand her
with growing horror
hes moving her by helicopter
nothing but the best
we hear the surge of a jet engine as willy runs out of the room
a sikorsky s medevac chopper is preparing to take off very loud and windy
through the open doorway and the thick windows we can glimpse crawford sitting beside jennifer who is strapped on to a gurney
shes connected to life support equipment
the med tech is outside checking a few last supplies and giving crawford a moment alone with his wife
he may be whispering to her
or adjusting her pillow
hard to tell
as he climbs out of the chopper he sees willy across the roof arguing with dr
lunt who is skimming the court documents shaking his head
crawford curious walks toward the two men
lunt hands crawford the court order
as crawford reads them lunt and willy shout over the helicopter engine this orders him not to take her off life support
we cant stop the man from then just hold it for a couple of hours
have it inspected
youre talking about a phenomenally expensive delay mr
slocum when the man has every right to move his wife
shes not gonna get there
he looks at crawford reading amused thoughtful
this man is a mechanical engineer with expertise in air crashes
he has access to airfields and he knows exactly how to make it look like an accident
you know what he did
you know why shes like this
lunt hesitates feeling a tiny edge of doubt
crawford checks his watch
looks into willys eyes then gestures for willy to join him and turns back to walk across the pad to the helicopter
willy stares stunned
lunt looks at him case closed
the rotors whirl faster engine noise rising to a scream
from the open chopper doorway crawford looks at willy again and gestures for him to get on
willy doesnt know how to react
slowly he starts to walk toward the helicopter
willy bends coming to the door wind whipped flinching
crawford holds out a hand to help him in
willy doesnt move
the pilot glances back
crawfords eyes are locked with willys
willy stares at crawford scared
but unable to back down from the crude plain challenge
which crawford is clearly counting on
angry at himself willy climbs in without taking crawfords hand
as he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in the med tech secures the door the pilot turns to face front and they lift off
looking directly down at the sikorsky as it glides over a picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways gray and terra cotta rooftops blue kidneys and rectangles of pool
willy watches crawford who stares back at him
glances uneasily at the pilot bug headed in sun goggles and headphones
flying them calm
the med tech adjusting jennifers portable ventilator
the sikorsky glides over cross hatched parking lots a pale swath of beach and the white foaming edge of the pacific
willy looks up from the view
yells to the pilot
why are we going out over the ocean
willy looks at crawford
deep dark vast blue
the sikorsky flies over
willy stares into crawfords eyes
then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him hundreds of feet above the earth
the sunlight glare in the scratched windows
the blur of the rotors against the empty sky
the edges of the door frame
the rivets in the roof
willy unbuckles his seat belt lurches toward the pilot we have to turn back
get in your seat
hes doing something we have to turn back
whos doing something
willy points to crawford whos just sitting there he is
you have to get us down
get back in your goddamn seat
willy im not doing anything
everyone can see that
im telling you we have to turn back
hes doing someth an alarm begins to shriek on the ventilator
everyone turns as the med tech hastily kneels next to it whats happening
i dont know im theres a malfunction willy whips around to look at crawford with fury in his glare oh you bastard
crawford almost smiles
the med tech is flipping switches checking wires i cant do anything with this up here
the pilot turns steeply willy falling over the med techs supplies spilling as the med tech hastily removes jennifers breathing tube and prepares to begin c
the med tech looks up startled
what is it
willy watches wide eyed as the med tech grabs up his paperwork searching it what
the med tech looks up at willy scared
shes do not resuscitate
willy turns on crawford
its in her living will
the med tech looks at willy paralyzed
she signed it
theres a restraining order shes protected im authorizing you to do it
the med tech turns to crawford uncertain no extraordinary measures
turns to willy unless your court order specifies crawford contd contravening her living will
but i dont think it would
i think you got one that forbids me from disconn willy throws himself at crawford attacking him as the med tech grabs him drags him back the med tech holding
willy down on the floor by jennifers stretcher willy struggles furiously wait
willy is pointing at jennifer shocked as the med tech lets him up and they kneel by her the med tech taking her pulse willy staring down at her intent
willy whirls around to crawford
you messed up
with all your plans and games
willy turns back to jennifer
delicately strokes the side of her face
her eyes flutter open shhhh
its all right
she stares into willys eyes
he takes her hand
silent awe in her eyes
youre gonna be okay
she squeezes his hand
crawford is looking daggers die bitch
jennifers eyes fixed on willy roll back
she fights it
something sad in her wordless gaze
as it starts to fade
her eyes gone empty
her hand becoming lifeless in his
come on jennifer
tears well up in willys eyes but he struggles against them feeling crawfords gaze refusing him the satisfaction
dont let go
but shes gone
he stares down
letting his grief slowly burn into rage
he gently reaches up and closes her eyes
then he looks up at crawford who smiles sympathetically
you pushed it willy
we didnt have to be here
beat but now youre my witness
you saw i didnt touch anything i didnt do anything
the machine went down
anybody asks youll have to tell them
what you saw
beat thats really kind of perfect isnt it
willy stares into his eyes
then he looks away
out the window into the sun glare
the garage door is open letting in daylight
we can see the alley especially well because there are only empty hangers on the clothes bar and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart stacked on the floor
willy is packing
hes wearing jeans an old t shirt
he carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins throws them away
as he turns to go back in he sees lobruto coming along the alley wearing a suit
youre not answering your phone
thats kind of an answer in itself isnt it
willy heads back in starts to pack again
where are you headed
havent decided yet
just someplace else
i shouldnt have let it get so far out of control
beat we all lose willy
we just have to live with that and keep fighting the good fight
thats not what i was doing
you belong in a courtroom
willy packs thinking about that
shakes his head
i need to get to know myself better
youre a good lawyer
all this may have even made you a better lawyer
dont waste it
willy turns on him angry confused bitter i didnt just lose a case
i let a man get away with murder
respecting his pain
shrugs accepts the decision with regret
willy nods his thanks and turns back to packing
lobruto starts to leave
but from the alley door if it makes you feel any better technically you let a man get away with attempted murder
willy doesnt respond
lobruto goes out
after a moment willy stops
something turning over in his mind
lobruto is walking toward his car when willy steps out of the garage and calls after him his wife is dead
uncertain what willy is getting at
we can still get him
we can take him back to court
willy comes toward him excited insistent double jeopardy doesnt apply
we bring a new charge of homicide
willy what happened to you on the helicopter we dont even know if we could prove no he shot her and she died
the fact that it took time the fact that he went to trial in between just for shooting her doesnt matter
he fired a gun and caused her death and thats murder
beat if he can twist the law around then so can we
lobruto thinks it out
a second indictment on the same incident
a man burns down a house we charge him with arson
there were people sleeping upstairs and after weeks in the hospital they die
wed charge him with murder
on the fence but seeing it now
impressed with the young mans fervor and his logic
but he shakes his head
all your evidence is still toxic
the confession the arrest its all still inadmissible
im sorry willy
it was a good idea but ill get something new
willy looks up at him
you dont want to know
willy you cant i dont work for you
lobruto sighs as willy nods and turns to start back to the garage
with work to do
dont do anything crazy
what else have we got left
willy disappears inside
end of the day
marchand pulls on his coat shuts down his computer
he turns to go willy is standing in his doorway
i need a favor
willy follows an evidence clerk along an aisle between floor to ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers
these are from that thing at the courthouse right
the clerk stops checking a number against a slip of paper in his hand pulls down a box for willy
crawford is building a new rube goldberg device tools and parts laid out precisely on a table
eyes enlarged by the glasses he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal when a french door suddenly implodes a metal lawn chair hurled in from the backyard smashing through
crawford stands taking off the glasses as willy walks in over the broken glass carrying nunallys gun
willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall
you aint seen nothin yet
he presses the police emergency button then turns to crawford
i want the gun
youve already got one
i want the gun you shot your wife with
crawford doesnt move
willy raises his gun points it at crawfords face
one way or another im going to see to it you receive justice tonight
crawford studies willy
youre serious arent you
a smile dawning willy
you got religion didnt you
willy keeps the gun aimed at him
no its very sweet
gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute
considering the game
getting it like this is that going to hold up in court
i dont work for the d
im just a guy who broke into your house
when the police arrest me theyll inventory anything in my possession
if that happens to be crucial evidence in another case well some prosecutor just got lucky
crawford studies willys eyes over the muzzle of the gun between them
it takes a very special kind of person to look right into someones eyes and pull the trigger
it takes a unique kind of strength
i guess youd know that
willy cocks the gun
crawford shakes his head
eyes on willy
i dont think so
willy doesnt lower the gun
but he doesnt pull the trigger either
you dont know me
crawford smiles slightly
then im in for a rude awakening
willy glares over the gun
his bluff called
refusing to back down
where did you even get yourself a gun
bitter its nunallys
crawford is thrown by this but conceals it well
willy grimaces over the gun still aimed at crawfords face
he has backed himself into a corner and hes getting scared
because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake crawford out with is starting to seem like his only way out
even crawford sees it
in willys eyes
the uncertain edge of the idea
he could just do it
end the game
blow crawfords brains all over the wall
there i was with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse
it would be so easy
with his life already a shambles
with everything already lost
at least he would have this
put it down
i thought you might appreciate the irony
willys finger tightens on the trigger
and willy does
distracted by a thought
lowering the gun slightly looking at it remembering marchand on the phone holding the gun crawford surrendered in its plastic evidence bag a perfectly good
heckler and koch nine millimeter
crawford is getting edgy watching willy study nunallys gun the police will be here very soon
the exact same type of gun you bought your wife a month before
he looks up at crawford
nunally setting down his pistol on the chair as crawford across the room sets down his on the table
if they see you with a gun in your hand theyre not likely to ask a lot of questions
thats why you went to the hotel
surveillance cam view crawford lets himself into the room thats why you went into the room
crawford quietly closes the door behind him
stands taking it all in willy looks at crawford
you took his gun
crawford checks the dresser drawers the night table finds nunallys badge holster and gun
and you left him yours
crawford replaces nunallys gun with his own matching pistol which was tucked into the back of his belt
crawford shrugs arrogant i gave it back
yes you did
crawford fires at jennifer crawford shoots at the transom after youd used it
crawford holds out the gun to nunally making the offer then you told nunally youd put it down if he put down his
nunally setting down his pistol on the chair as crawford across the room sets down his on the table
willy turns looking into the alcove thats why you moved her back there nunally rushes past crawford to kneel by jennifer shocked frantic the truth is i could have done
it right in front of the man and he wouldnt have noticed
ignoring crawford behind him
other things on his mind
nunallys calling for help on the walkie talkie desperately starting c
as behind him crawford picks up the murder weapon nunallys gun from the table and walks over to the chair where nunally left crawfords gun from his holster
and all you had to do was switch the guns back in the commotion crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the chair in its place
and then wait he then comes back to put his gun on the table where it will be mistaken for the murder weapon
nunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair upset distracted puts it in his holster until nunally walked the murder weapon right out of the house
a detective drops jennifers gun into an evidence bag as nunally walks out
willy stares at crawford
in real wonder
you know this is really kind of fun
its like showing some caveman a cigarette lighter
willy looks down at the gun in his hand
this cavemans gonna put you in prison for the rest of your life
its still not evidence willy
theres no prints left by now
nothing ties that gun to me
willy smiles slow
enjoying himself at last
that would be true
except for all those eggs
willy nods to himself going to the wooden bowl of ball bearings selecting one carrying it to the rube goldberg machine with all those little cracks and weak places
shooting himself right there in the courthouse
i didnt think he was going to do that
studying the complex device toying with crawford i mean we all knew he was going to fall apart sooner or later
that was part of your plan right
like a bank shot on a pool table you kill your wife and destroy her lover
with one bullet
turns well four bullets actually
trying to see what willys getting at
first bullet goes into your wife
crawford fires at jennifer then three more out the front of the house to get some attention
and fires three times at the transom
then while youre waiting for the show to begin you have to reload nunallys gun
crawford pushes new bullets into the clip i mean you dont want him wondering where the hell four bullets went considering he never fired his gun that night
and slides the clip back into the gun pleased
willy nods thinking it out
sure of himself
he sets the ball bearing into the slot at the top of the machine and im betting you didnt worry about fingerprints
close crawfords fingers putting the bullets in the clip
willy lets the ball go watching it begin rolling down the ornate tracks
i mean why would you
nobodys going to be looking at his gun
the ball tumbles and clatters flipping and clicking through the ingenious precise heartless machinery and sooner or later life goes on those four incriminating bullets would get used and be
and crawford is recognizing slowly his one mistake
the gun in nunallys limp dead fingers glimpsed on the marble courthouse floor through the crowd
except nunally only fired one of those bullets
willy turns from the machine which continues clattering and working beside him
which means there are still three left with your fingerprints on them tom
in this clip
he holds the gun up
savoring crawfords growing fear
they can hear a car rolling up the driveway
red and blue lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door
everybody has a weak spot right
some place they break
without looking willy gently pushes the machine moving it a fraction of an inch on the floor as the ball catapults out sailing across the living room in a perfect
graceful arc that misses the bowl
outside the police car doors open and then slam
crawford going pale watches the metal ball roll off the coffee table and across the floor toward him
crawford doesnt move
trying to focus
his mind working
the ball comes to rest against crawfords shoe
the doorbell rings
crawford looks up
meeting willys eyes
smiling slightly willy tucks nunallys gun into his belt and puts his hands in the air
and gives crawford a wink
crawford is staring at willy frozen panic and hatred and fear curdling in his eyes as behind him the police begin pounding on the front door
