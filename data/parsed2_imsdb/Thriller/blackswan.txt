written by mark heyman andres heinz john mclaughlin january a spotlight slices black space
in its beam a dancer materializes
she is fair skinned
beautiful and pure
the maiden twirls on pointe a smile on her face light as air and carefree
she pauses her face grows worried
sensing someone watching
scared she peers into the darkness
she moves now looking growing more frantic
then a sinister man emerges out of the darkness behind her
she stumbles backwards frightened
she tries to escape twirling away but he pursues
his true form is revealed the demon rothbart
he flings his open hand towards her casting the spell
she wants to scream but nothing comes out
she looks at her body sensing something happening to her
she spins panicking but its too late
she disappears beneath the beasts cape
she emerges as the white swan the iconic protagonist of swan in the darkness a pair of eyes
they belong to nina the same dancer
she lies awake in bed thinking about her dream
the room looks like it hasnt been redecorated since she was a teenager
pink and frilly
the door opens throwing light on her face
nina looks towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it
nina sits up and hangs her bare feet off the side of the bed
like all ballerinas shes beautiful and her feet are atrocious
covered in corns broken blisters and bunions
she arches them doing her first extensions of the day
the room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing
a large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely
nina rubs her knees to get them warm and then begins her morning exercises extending and contracting her feet and legs in precise and rhythmic motions
the skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum
defined vertebrae run up her back sinewy muscles contract as she moves
her slender neck leads into her hair contained in a ballerinas bun
nina looks serene as she moves completely in her element
she hears someone fussing about in the kitchen
i had the most amazing dream last night
i was dancing the white swan
different choreography like the bolshois
it was the prologue when rothbart casts his spell
still no answer
nina continues to stretch
nina sits at the table
an older woman erica places a poached egg and a quarter grapefruit in front of her
youre in a good mood
im just excited to get back
off season always makes you grumpy
look how pink
inside joke inside joke pretty
they giggle and erica resumes packing ninas shoulder bag with extra clothing shoes snack filled tupperware duct tape ribbon thread etc
plus he promised to feature me more
he certainly should
youre the most dedicated dancer in the company
nina smiles comforted and begins taking her vitamins
erica walks over with a sweatshirt and holds it above her
nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms through the sleeves
erica points to her shoulder
nina feels and finds a small she shrugs and shakes her head
erica gives her a suspicious look but lets it go and smiles
nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt
erica hugs nina into her chest and kisses the top of her head
erica releases her and nina begins eating
nina rides inside a crowded subway staring absentmindedly at her faint reflection in the trains window
suddenly another train roars by on the opposite track snapping her awake
in the next train car she sees the back of a ballerina standing in the midst of the crowd
her head bops to music playing through ipod earphones
nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes and at that exact moment the girl in the next car moves in the same way
unnerved nina slowly lowers her arm
so does the other girl
although nina cant quite see her face the girl seems identical from ninas vantage point
the train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station
nina sees the girl head to the exit
she cranes to see her face but her views obscured
the doors slide shut and the train pulls out
nina watches the platform whisk by keeping her eyes peeled but she doesnt see the girl
nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street
she arrives at the majestic looking theater where a few other ballerinas likewise trickle towards the entrance
they all look strangely similar slender carrying shoulder bags wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts
she passes a row of posters featuring the companys prima ballerina beth macintyre
nina looks at them a little envious before continuing on to the stage door
crammed into a single dressing room nina and the companys soloists get ready for rehearsal
chatting sewing ribbon onto shoes applying makeup putting band aids on blisters
nina removes a new pair of ballet shoes admires them for a moment before cutting off the satin toe with scissors
in the background catty veronica and russian galina gossip
cant believe shes back
of course she is
she cant take a hint
no one comes to see her anymore
no one comes to see ballet period
thats not true i heard the royal had one of their best seasons yet
he needs to try something new
no someone new
like someone whos not approaching menopause
i think its sad
beths such an amazing dancer
sos my grand mother
fonteyn danced into her s
yeah we know
irked nina starts pounding the shoes against the floor to soften the toe
her eyes are drawn to a new girl standing in the doorway
nina pauses to scrutinize her
she wears vampy make up hair down
dark and sexy
wary the girls mumble mmm hmms and nod
she slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down at an open spot
fucking got off the wrong stop and had to hoof it from th
nina exchanges glances with the other girls taken aback
the new girl notices the looks smirks to herself and starts getting ready
nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire company warms up including the pubescent corps members and a handful of male dancers
legs hands and feet repeat the same movements all around her led by a severe ballet mistress
to the back fondu to the back plie
fourth fourth and one and fifth to the back
to a corps member like this
why cant you do this
using the mirror nina monitors her movements carefully
the mistress surprises her
it needs to be looser
let it flow
flustered nina nods and tries to follow her instruction
suddenly the girls around nina begin stripping off their sweatshirts and insulated pants
nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the company thomas leroy has entered the space
he has the unkept look of an artist
magnetic and intense
the ballerinas remove their warm up gear to show off their bodies
leroy walks around the room judging his flock
smiles and glances are thrown his way
he goes up to the ballet mistress takes her hand and kisses her on the cheek
even she manages a smile
he heads to the line of soloists studying them
we all know the story virginal girl pure and sweet trapped in the body of a swan
she desires freedom but only true love can break the spell
he taps a dancer on the shoulder she lights up
he walks then taps another
a selection process of some kind
nina looks nervous has an inkling of what it means
her wish is granted in the form of a prince
he nears nina
she sneaks peeks at him eager and hopeful
he acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile
but he walks on without tapping her
but before he can declare his love her lustful twin the black swan tricks and seduces him
he approaches the new girl
nina watches threatened
but he doesnt tap her either
devastated the white swan leaps off a cliff killing herself
but in death finds freedom
he taps one more soloist and then claps
the music stops and all the girls face him attentive
good morning company
they respond good morning in nervous unsure voices
we open our season with swan lake
done to death i know
but not like this
we strip it down
make it visceral and real
he pauses for effect
and a new production needs a new swan queen
a fresh face to present to the world
surprised the soloists glance at each other trying to keep their cool
but which of you can embody both swans
the white and the black
nina prepares for disappointment
all the soloists i touched
please go to your scheduled rehearsals this afternoon
the girls are confused
and the girls i didnt touch meet me in studio b at five
nina breathes realizing the girls he didnt tap are the ones hes selected purposefully toying with them
hidden inside a nook nina has her eyes closed nervously humming the score to swan lake
she makes small motions with her feet and hands going through the choreography in her mind
preparing for the audition
a loud crashing sound snaps her out of it
she goes out into the hallway to investigate
the door to a principal dressing room is halfway open
nina cautiously approaches
inside she can see someone moving around the room in a fury trashing it
suddenly the door swings open and beth macintyre bursts out
she makes brief eye contact with nina
nina just shakes her head
beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her
she clips down the hall in the opposite direction
nina waits until shes gone then moves closer to the door and peeks inside curious
she checks to make sure no ones around and quickly enters
large and comfortable
beths presence is everywhere
photographs clothing and personal belongings scattered across the space
nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles imagining how great it would be
then she notices a large vase lying on the floor
the flowers have been shredded water everywhere
she moves to the vanity counter and touches beths belongings in reverence
the items are neatly laid out ballet supplies jewelry and makeup
her fingers brush a tube of lipstick
she picks it up
nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room
in the middle of her audition nina dances odettes variation from act ii of the ballet a frightened look on her face
although her movement is incredibly precise theres a definite vulnerability
exactly as the white swan should be fear tinged with melancholy
leroy waves his arm
the music and nina stop abruptly
he approaches her and when he gets close taps on her sternum with two of his fingers
so nina would you like to be the swan queen
if you want me to be
he leans in and talks softly so the other girls cant hear
well if i was just casting the white swan shed be yours
she cant help but smile flattered
he pulls away from her
but im not
he turns to the piano player
maestro odiles coda
the piano player rifles through the song book
show me your black swan nina
nervous she glances over at veronica and galina who anxiously await their turn
she takes a few breaths then looks towards the piano player and nods
the music begins
nina dances a few steps and then launches into the most difficult and famous part of swan lake the black swans coda
it consists of consecutive fouettes spins
come on not so controlled
the music builds in intensity she pushes herself into the next turn
not just the prince but the court the audience the entire world
the fouettes are like a spider spinning her web
leroy runs his hand through his hair dismayed
a look of worry spreads across ninas face
knows shes blowing it
the door clangs open and throws ninas focus completely
she stumbles several spins short of finishing
the new girl obliviously marches into the room listening to an ipod
good of you to join us
the new girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her earphones to talk
girls this is lily
straight off the plane from san francisco
shes filling rebeccas old spot
lily gives a small wave
nina eyes her with scorn as she catches her breath
go on get warmed up
lily starts stripping off her layers revealing her lithe body
on her back she has a tattoo of lilies
should i go again
distracted by lily ive seen enough
thank you nina
she looks down getting his meaning
the white swans variation
furious nina marches out of the room
nina stands up from a kneeled position and flushes the toilet
she wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and exits the stall
nina walks along a quiet side street
she clutches her jacket for warmth and comfort
her cell phone starts ringing
she digs it out of her bag and checks the caller id mom
she silences it and puts it away
up ahead she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction site and detour into an enclosed passageway beneath the scaffolding
nina slows a little scared but decides to push on
the passageway is dark
the temporary lighting dim and flickering
she walks quickly trying to get to the other side
she hears the sound of soft footsteps approaching
she stops and the other footsteps stop
she looks up and sees the faint outline of a slender woman standing there almost ghostlike
nina starts walking again keeping her head down and the other woman continues as well
as they pass each other nina glances at the womans face and discovers
the woman looks exactly like her
but the moment passes as the woman continues walking
nina stares after her perturbed
her cell phone starts ringing again piercing the silence
nina continues out ignoring the phone
nina enters and locks the deadbolt and chain lock behind her
she turns and is startled to see erica standing right there
how did it go
nina looks at her confused
erica helps take off her coat
you were late so i called susie in the office
cant believe he just sprung that on you
it went okay
erica hangs up her coat turns and sees nina tearing up
the tears start falling now
erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace
shhh shhh tell me what happened
nina lies on the floor stewing
her legs straight in the air to drain the lactic acid in her muscles
i told them it doesnt matter how talented their daughter is if she misses any more classes shes out
she forgets half of what i teach her and i waste time catching her up
nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her bag
she considers them for a moment then starts to put them on
she stands takes a breath and does a single spin testing the waters
she takes a breath and spins again then again then again
each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor
she jabs her toe down hard
she winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot
nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe
her right big toenail has split oozing blood
nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on
she reassumes the position takes a couple breaths and starts spinning again
her toe jabs into the floor
she winces a little with pain but keeps pushing
her face grows more determined focused
she starts to look powerful willing herself to succeed
at the end of the nd spin nina jabs her foot down hard
shes done it
nina looks at herself in the mirror glazed in sweat a slight smile of satisfaction
nina sits on the edge of the bed as erica douses some gauze with peroxide and dabs it on the split toenail
nina reacts to the sting
youre working yourself too hard
we all have off days
if that girl hadnt barged in
im sure she didnt mean to
remember when you started
if i hadnt taken you to each of your classes you would have been completely lost
im gonna talk to him
tell him i finished it
he knows you can do the coda
it wont convince him one way or the other
annoyed nina lies down looking away from her mother
oh sweetheart i know its disappointing
when you start to get older theres all this ridiculous pressure
god knows i understand
erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it into ninas calves
but its alright
no matter what
youll probably get to dance the pas de quatre again
thats such a wonderful part
or maybe hell make you a big swan
either way youll shine
i know mom
erica removes ninas earrings then opens a jewelry box sitting on the night stand and drops them inside
a toy ballerina spins to tinny music
nina gets under the covers
erica tucks her in and sits down on the edge of the bed
everything will be better in the morning
it always is
she strokes ninas hair humming along to the music
nina watches the ballerina spin and spin with a determined stare
nina applies the lipstick she stole from beth using the side window as a mirror
the jerky motion of the train makes it difficult but she manages
nina waits anxiously outside leroys office
she hears someone approach looks up and sees leroy coming down the hall
she puts on a nervous smile
he doesnt reciprocate
do you have a minute
he doesnt answer just opens the door to the office and walks in
she takes a breath and then follows
nina closes the door and faces the cozy dark space
large couch posters from the ballet on the wall several featuring beth
leroy lights a cigarette quietly studying her and not making this easy
he takes a drag and exhales
if nows not a good time
nows fine what is it
i just wanted to tell you i practiced the coda last night and i did it
how thrilling for you
okay nina listen i honestly dont care about your technique you should know that by now
yes but anyway ive already chosen veronica so
he lifts his hands in the air there you go
she makes a move towards the door
youre not going to try and change my mind
she looks back at him uncertain
leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette
you must have thought it was possible coming to find me like this
he pauses looks her up and down as if trying to decipher her
why are you here
all dolled up
i came to ask you to give me the part
she doesnt know what he means
he comes around his desk and approaches her
truth is when i look at you all i see is the white swan
yes youre beautiful fragile fearful
but the black swan
its a hard fucking job to dance both
i can be the black swan too
shes hungry volatile
in four years every time you dance i see you obsess over getting each move exactly right but i never see you lose yourself
insecure she looks like she wants to run out of the room
all that discipline for what
i want to be perfect
perfections not just about control
its also about letting go
surprising the audience
he considers her for a moment
very few have it in them
without warning he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth
it lasts for a moment but he suddenly jerks away
he touches his lip stunned
you bit me
shes too scared to respond
i cant believe it
that fucking hurt
he goes to the mirror to check for damage
he glances back at nina
she quickly leaves shell shocked
the company stretch and go through their usual warm up routine a tension in the air
the casting decision still uncertain
nina touches her lips thinking about the encounter
then looks over at veronica knowing the good news in store
nina looks away
nina shakes her head
a sudden energy sweeps the room and she hears the sound of scuffling feet and whispering
she just posted it
the dancers start exiting into the hallway
veronica turns to follow
veronica turns around
its hard but nina decides to be a good loser
nina subtly glances at the exiting girls and veronica immediately gets it
she excitedly pushes through the crowd of girls wanting to see for herself
knowing the outcome already nina continues stretching in the deserted space resigned to her fate
she finishes grabs her belongings and walks out
a crowd of dancers surround the bulletin board jostling to get a look
nina starts walking down the hall in the opposite direction
behind her she can hear a small commotion and then why did you tell me that
she turns and sees veronica her face flushed with anger
your idea of a joke
veronica storms away
the group of girls stares at nina making her very self conscious
nina tentatively approaches the bulletin board to see what veronicas outburst was all about
first a few then more and more of the girls smile at her
they make room for her as she pushes through
she finally gets to the casting notice finds swan queen stunned she turns around to face the mass of ballerinas
she sees lily eyeing her with a flat expression which turns into a smile to mask her disappointment
the other girls start congratulating and hugging nina some more sincerely than others
nina bursts in through the door and heads directly for one of the stalls
she locks herself in for privacy and dials a number on her cell phone
she holds it to her ear anxiously waiting for the person to answer
he picked me mommy
she waits for a response
did you hear me
yes im going to be the swan queen
nina laughs at her mothers response and cant help but start crying
ill be home soon okay
i just had to tell you
nina hangs up and the tears really start flowing
shes dreamt of this for so long its almost too much to bear
she wipes the tears off with the back of her hand and pulls herself together
she comes out of the stall
horrified to discover whore written on the mirror in red nina looks around the bathroom to make sure shes alone
she snags a paper towel and wipes off the insult smearing the mirror with red streaks
nina unlocks the door to the apartment
nina looks around puzzled she isnt there
nina opens the door and pokes her head in
but ericas not in there either
nina glances at the walls
where several homemade paintings hang all of the same subject nina as a young girl posing in a tutu
on a desk the original photograph is clipped to a painting in progress
out of the corner of her eye one of the portraits seems to shift
nina turns towards it but the paintings now perfectly still
unsettled nina withdraws
post shower ninas fuzzy reflection stares back in a steam covered mirror
nina takes her hand and wipes a streak across to see herself more clearly
she looks nervous
the enormity of whats in front of her setting in
she turns side to side scrutinizing her body
she lifts her arm and pinches the skin to check her weight
she notices a small cluster of red bumps on her shoulder
a small rash
she feels the bumps with her fingers bothered
she checks the same place on her other shoulder
theres no rash just faint streaks of scar tissue
nina slides the hamper in front of the door to block it
in the mirror now one of the bumps is scratched and bleeding
nina quickly wipes the blood off with her finger
the sound of the front door opening steals her attention
nina exits the bathroom wearing a robe
in the kitchen she sees a cake with a lit sparkler sitting on the table
her mother smiles anxiously
my daughter the swan queen
she opens her arms and nina falls into a hug
she looks at the cake
it has a ballerina sketched with frosting
nina hides her disdain
its our favorite vanilla with strawberry filling
erica picks up a knife and slices into the cake
just a little piece
erica ignores her and starts cutting a very large piece
thats way too much
its a celebration
my stomachs still in knots
erica grabs the whole cake and heads towards the trash
erica hesitates but returns
she sets the cake back down
im just so proud of you
erica lifts the slice onto a plate
it looks yummy
first day in the new role nina stretches alone
muffled sounds of other ballerinas chatting and giggling drift in from the large rehearsal space
makes nina feel a little isolated
nina turns and sees david the high cheeked cocky dancer playing prince siegfried
it is so full where do i stand
it is his version of a joke
nina politely laughs
good luck finding a spot
i am david
i know you are
here we go huh
she nods nervous
david dances around the space miming a hunt with a cross bow
nina enters stretches her body to illustrate her transformation into human then sees david and acts spooked
she dances away from him a scared look on her face undulating her arms to resemble a birds flapping
david gives chase but nina spins out of his grasp disentangles from him
but he eventually snags her and they come very close together
the music stops
nina breaks out of character and looks at leroy anxious for his reaction
the russian ballet mistress nods and smiles clearly pleased
nina smiles relieved
leroy hops out of his chair and approaches
but i knew the white swan wouldnt be a problem
the real work will be your metamorphosis into the black swan
i saw a flash of her yesterday
get ready to show me more of that bite
he gives her an impish smirk
she looks down embarrassed
nina takes a drink from the water fountain
she hears music emanating from the large rehearsal studio
curious she walks to the open doorway and stops to watch
corps members and a few soloists form two lines on both sides of the room
in the middle veronica dances along with lily
nina pays close attention to lily sizing her up
her dancing is explosive exudes sex
watch the way she moves
leroy has snuck up behind nina at the doorway and gets very close to her
imprecise but sensual
shes not faking it
lily makes a small mistake but cracks up laughing amused rather than bothered by her blunder
nina stares at her attracted and threatened
the companys administrator susie shows nina into the room
you share with beth from now on so be considerate
awed nina looks around the room
she scans beths photographs and personal belongings and lands on a large bouquet of fresh flowers
those are for you
nina pulls a card out from the flowers and reads
a faint smile curls her lips
she opens her shoulder bag and removes a small satchel
she pulls out a pair of diamond stud earrings and puts them on
leroy pulls nina through a fundraiser gala filled with rich looking patrons and some dancers from the company
bewildered nina takes in her high society surroundings getting the occasional curious glance as she passes
leroy grabs a couple champagne glasses off a waiters tray
he hands a glass to nina with a smile
he leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the party
ready to be thrown to the wolves
we need their cash so smile
she smiles as instructed
ladies and gentlemen good evening
the crowd turns their gaze towards them
all eyes on her
as i stand here tonight i see so many familiar faces
your contribution to the art we all cherish profoundly goes straight to my heart and i am very grateful
let me begin with a very important announcement
you all have had the chance to be enchanted transported sometimes devastated by the performances of this true artist of our company
she has been an exceptional inspiration to my work a role model to our dancers and a deeply satisfying presence on our stage
you all know who i am talking about
beth macintyre more applause
nervous nina unconsciously picks at her cuticles
as we all know every great career comes to an end
beth is retiring at the end of the season
she will be giving her farewell performance as melpomene the role she originated in my first ballet
people start whispering stunned by the news
nina sees beth in the crowd giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests
trying to remain dignified
she will be greatly missed but she will always be remembered
my little princess
amidst the mummering nina sees beth quietly sneak out of the crowd and out the front door
leroy quickly covers
but as we bid adieu to one star we welcome another
he looks at nina
she stops picking her nails self conscious
as you know we open our season with my new version of swan lake
taking the role of our new swan queen is the exquisite ms
nina steps forward and curtseys
someone seems to giggle at her
insecure nina glances towards the source and sees lily flirting with a rich gent uninterested in the official proceedings
soon you will have the pleasure of seeing her perform tonight we raise a glass
to all of you to nina to beth to beauty
he downs his drink and the crowd follows suit
party guests surround nina and leroy trying to meet the companys newest star
nina basks in all the attention
brinson and his lovely wife ellen tonights sponsors
she shakes dr
brinsons hand and curtseys to mrs
such a beautiful event
not as beautiful as you dear
theyre replaced by another husband and wife
and this is mr
nina repeats the pleasantries this time noticing that one of her cuticles is bleeding
she awkwardly pulls her hand away
leroy leans in and whispers in her ear
relax youre doing great
nina washes her hands
she looks at herself in the mirror and takes a deep breath
someone knocks on the door
just a second
she turns off the water and wipes her damp hands on the back of her neck trying to cool herself
she checks her finger
no blood but theres a hangnail
nina takes hold of the small flap and tries to yank it off
accidentally tearing a strip of skin from the nail to her second knuckle
more knocking startles her
im about to burst
nina quickly balls up the peeled skin and throws it away
she opens the door
lily pushes in
look who it is
lily closes the door behind her and locks it
im lily by the way
dont think weve officially met
our new swan queen
that is so huge
you must be freaking out
lily slides her panties out from under her dress and puts them in her clutch
i should probably get back
keep me company
lily starts to refresh her makeup
nina stays put for a second uncertain
she opens the door and steps out where shes immediately met by leroy
ah there you are
lily closes the door behind her
leroy escorts nina out
its a couple hours later and shes tipsy
she stumbles a little and grabs onto leroy
i think i drank too much
all those toasts
you did well
they tried to eat you alive but here you are in one piece
ill get you a cab
where you going
oh upper west side
why dont you come to my place first
its on the way
she gives him a coy glance reading between the lines and hiding her excitement
for a drink
unless youve had enough
no thats good
he starts to look for a cab
they turn see mrs
brinson the host of the party standing at the door
you need to say hello to karen halloway before you disappear
shes from texas
correction she is texas
a minute more of ass kissing
he runs back inside to say his goodbyes
nina smiles after him giddy and anxious
she notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of the adjoining doorway
in the dark she looks like nina
spotted the figure backs up seeming to disappear
nina cautiously approaches but cant see anyone
she gets closer to the doorway
and someone jumps out startling her
its beth drunk and shivering
cheeks streaked with mascara
what are you doing out here
beth stares her down
nina backs up nervously grabbing her earlobe
i was crushed to hear that youre leaving
whatd you do to get the role
nina shakes her head confused
he always said you were a frigid little girl
her words needle nina too close to the truth
so what did you do to make him change his mind
suck his cock
some of us dont need to do that
ninas struck a nerve
beth starts to come at her
you fucking little whore
beth im whats going on
they both turn to see leroy returned
i need to talk to you
you should go home
dont do that
dont just dismiss me
poor poor little princess
try to hold it together
im going to drop by later okay
i have something i want to give you
he puts his arm around nina starts to lead her away
a token of my appreciation
he ignores her and raises his arm to hail a cab
as they enter the cab beth calls after them
make the most of it nina
through the cab window nina looks at beth troubled by her words
tasteful but spare loft
modern and expensive furniture
nina stands alone looking around his inner sanctum wide eyed
she explores the pieces of art the furniture
she touches some of it in awe
she turns finds leroy holding out yet another flute of champagne
for himself a scotch
she looks up at him expecting him to make a move
instead he walks away and sits in a chair
he gestures for her to sit as well
confused she sits across from him alone on the large couch
he takes an unceremonious sip of his drink and studies her
uncomfortable she takes a drink as well
i thought itd be good to talk about the role
ground us a little
the better we get to know each other the more productive well be
i dont want there to be any boundaries between us
so do you have a boyfriend
shes caught off guard by his question and just smiles uncomfortably
he waits for an answer
finally she manages a reply
have you had many in the past
but no one serious
youre not a virgin are you
her expression sours at this line of questioning
she shakes her head
then theres nothing to be embarrassed about is there
she shakes her head and you enjoy making love
do you enjoy it
blushing and feeling awkward she takes a sip of champagne
we need to be able to talk about this
nina looks at him embarrassed and shrugs
he smirks and joins her on the couch
i have a homework assignment for you
go home and masturbate
live a little
she blanches scandalized
he finishes off his scotch and stands
lots of work tomorrow
the doorman will find you a cab
he leaves her alone in the living room
nina looks at herself in the mirror removing bobbie pins as erica folds clothing and puts it away
sounds like quite an evening
wish i could have been there
you know i asked
i know susie told me
guess he wanted you all to himself
thats not why
erica looks adoringly at ninas reflection in the mirror
i dont blame him
erica starts to remove ninas diamond earrings but pauses
where did you get these
erica removes the earrings then walks behind nina to unzip her
nina faces her
i can do it
nina turns back around reticent
he must have been at your side all night showing you off
erica finishes unzipping the red dress and sees ninas shoulder
remembering nina pulls away from her
its just a rash
erica gruffly pulls nina to the mirror and turns her around
what are you talking about
nina checks her reflection and sees the rash red and irritated from scratching
it was worse a couple days ago
its already getting better
youve been scratching again
erica yanks her out of the room
nina sits on the toilet stripped to her underwear
she does her best to cover herself
erica finishes dabbing her back with hydrogen peroxide and replaces the cap on the bottle
she pulls out nail clippers and cuts ninas nails down to their base
each click makes nina twitch
i thought youd outgrown this disgusting habit
click you havent done it for years
click mom please
erica grabs ninas other hand
its the role isnt it
all this pressure
i was worried itd be too much
nina stares at her seething
nina crawls into bed avoiding her mothers eyes
dont be mad at me
you know i love you you know i want whats best
but we have to take care of you
nina doesnt respond
erica opens the jewelry box and the tinny music begins playing
she hums and starts to stroke ninas hair
nina tries to brush her hand away
but erica brings it back and keeps stroking
nina lies wide awake after a restless night
she slowly reaches down under the covers down between her legs to complete leroys homework assignment
she closes her eyes and starts to maneuver
she suddenly hears a rustling sound and a short snore
she freezes and opens her eyes
she slowly sits up in bed and sees erica sleeping on a chair in the corner of the room
nina glares at her
nina waits her turn as a row of dancers perform grand jetes diagonally across the room
she watches veronica perform her leaps
she rejoins the group giving nina a nasty stare
nina avoids it looking towards lily who gives her a small smile
just as ninas turn arrives a panicked young corps dancer rushes in and makes a beeline for the severe ballet mistress
nina takes one leap and then stops dancing sensing somethings wrong
the corps dancer whispers into the ballet mistress ear
a look of shock on the mistress face
the dancer collapses into the older womans arms
the piano music trickles to a halt
nina exchanges glances with some of the other dancers
first a few then more dancers approach the two women wanting to find out whats happened
nina hangs back filled with a sinking feeling
nina sits as leroy worse for the wear stares at the jets of water
she walked into the street got hit by a car
oh my god
im sure she did it on purpose
how do you know
everything beth ever did came from within
from some dark impulse
its what could make her so thrilling to watch
even perfect at times
but also destructive
nina hesitates but has to ask
was it right after we saw her
its not your problem
this has nothing to do with you
she looks away not so sure
nina dont let yourself be distracted
dance is not immortalized like music poetry or art
it lives for now
for this moment only
and this is your moment
she attempts a nod
beths belongings have already been packed up and cleared
guilt ridden nina tries to get ready
she picks up her duffel bag and removes her satchel
she unpacks its contents onto the counter needle and thread cigarettes a makeup compact and the tube of lipstick
she looks over at the vase of flowers
a few have wilted
she pulls them out to make the bouquet look fresh again
nina exits the elevator with a brown shopping bag
she walks down a stark hallway and approaches beths hospital room
members of beths family surround the bed blocking beth from view
nina considers going in but shyly sulks past drawing the attention of an older nurse
you can go in
the older nurse gives her a skeptical glance and continues on her rounds
nina walks a little further and leans against the wall to wait
she hears the sound of shuffling feet looks over and sees the group of people exit the room and walk down the hall comforting one another
nina steps out from hiding and goes inside
beth is bandaged and unconscious attached to machines
nina stands at a distance too intimidated to approach at first
she looks around the room
it is lined with large expensive she removes the flowers leroy gave her from the brown bag and sets them next to the others
nina slowly approaches beths bedside
beths face is heavily wrapped with bandages
only her closed eyes and pale lips can be seen
she scans down her body sees a sliver of her thigh purple with bruises
curious nina lifts the top edge of the blanket and peeks underneath
the legs are bloated and horribly bruised pierced with large pins to reset the shattered bones
she looks lower and lower and discovers maggots feeding on her ankles
nina turns away confronted by the older nurse
what are you doing
nina doesnt have an answer
she just stumbles out the door
nina steps out of her apartment into the dim hallway lugging a bag of trash
she notices some wooden debris from an apartment renovation sitting near the trash chute
nina drops the trash bag in the chute then picks up a piece of broken wood
she considers it for a moment and hides it inside the sleeve of her sweatshirt
nina quietly steps inside and heads towards her bedroom
through ericas open bedroom door nina can see erica busily sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes humming to herself
nina quietly slips back inside her room
she removes the wood piece and jams it between the door closet creating a makeshift doorjamb she tests it
holds pretty well
she hears a creek
she removes the wood and sticks it inside her dresser not ready just yet
she quickly lies down on her bed and waits to be tucked in
the door squeaks open and nina looks towards it
nina david and the dancer playing rothbart rehearse the black swan and prince siegfrieds pas de deux from act
david lifts her then sets her down and they lean in towards each other almost kissing
no no not so stiff
dont be scared of him
she pulls away from david not at all coyly
leroy exhales frustrated
nina and david dance the next part of the section looking more worn out
forget about control
i want to see passion
she still looks tense not getting it
let it out
nina practices with an older ballet mistress
she demonstrates a movement and nina mimics her
the mistress scrutinizes unimpressed
nina is worked over by a physical therapist
every joint and muscle aches but nina breathes through the pain
nina and david finish the section completely soaked with sweat
they look at leroy heaving breaths
david answer me this question are you interested in fucking her
david snickers embarrassed shakes his head
no of course not
no one would be
leroy comes face to face with her
nina your black swan still looks no different than your white swan
shess just as
b suddenly the lights turn off throwing them into total b darkness
leroy angrily marches to the door and whips it open
to someone in hall hey
were still working in here
lights back on
theres a momentary pause and then the lights return
to david piano player okay you guys can go
thank you for your patience
david gives her an insinuating glance then shakes his head
very used to leroys methods
david and the piano player leave them alone
c leroy approaches nina and takes her hands in his
c ill be the prince
made nervous by his touch she nods
he walks behind her and puts his hands on her waist
he starts humming the score
and then they begin
they do a series of lifts and spins leroy bracing her
he lets go she moves away from him
use each finger your face your tits everything
he grabs her wrist
he lets go
he grabs her other wrist she spins to face him
they get very close
just before they kiss she dips pulls away
he grabs her arm again she spins then he stops her her back to him
he runs his hands down her arms
just feel my touch and respond
she turns and leans in close as though to kiss him
almost touching lips
but then she tries to push off again
he tightens his grip holds her there
she looks back at him questioning
he looks at her intently pulls her to him and kisses her
she melts and eagerly kisses him back
he pulls away momentarily
open your mouth
nina follows his instruction
the kiss grows more heated and he wraps his arms around her
he pushes her back against the mirror
he runs his hand down her body then reaches between her legs
she gasps tries to pull his hand out but he persists
she throws her head back as he kisses her neck
she breathes deep emits short moans succumbing
suddenly he pulls away from her
she looks at him confused flushed and breathing hard
that was me seducing you
it needs to be the other way around
he turns and starts to walk away
she cant believe it
he ignores her and walks out of the room
nina sits on the floor head in hands
nina startles and looks up
sees the dark figure of somebody watching her from the doorway
looks like herself
lily emerges from the darkness dressed to leave
b lily sits down beside her oblivious of ninas desire b to be left alone
she digs out a cigarette from her bag
offers it to nina
nina doesnt take it
we cant smoke in here
i wont tell if you wont
nina reluctantly takes the cigarette holds it a little awkwardly clearly not a regular smoker
lily sparks a flame for her and then lights one for herself
nina puffs but doesnt inhale
big days getting closer and closer huh
i cant wait
youre going to be amazing
nina wipes off her tears with her hand
so want to talk about it
just had a hard day
leroy play too rough
nina looks at her surprised
he seems like a prick
sure but not exactly warm and fuzzy
you dont know him
lily smirks with a realization
someones hot for teacher
nina gives her a withering glance
i dont blame you
nina stands up
i should go
its getting late
hey i was only playing
nina walks towards the door
she ignores lily and exits
nina lies in the bath eyes closed concentrating
her body jostles slightly moving her hand between her legs seeking release
growing frustrated she moves more and more aggressively
she abruptly stops and submerges herself under the water defeated
she lies still her arms wrapped around her chest
she opens her eyes her vision distorted by the water
suddenly her blurred double appears staring down at her
nina shoots up
the double is gone
nina scans the bathroom but she is alone
nina notices some water dropping off her fingers onto the lip of the tub
then a few drops of red land on the white porcelain
worried she examines her fingernails which have started to grow back
she discovers blood and bits of skin
out of the tub nina checks herself in the mirror
her shoulder is streaked with deep scratches
she grabs a pair of little scissors from the medicine cabinet and starts trimming her fingernails
she looks up at the mirror and sees her reflection snip off the tip of her index finger
nina gasps and drops the scissors clanging in the sink
two of her fingers are bleeding their tips sliced
nina looks at the door already blocked by the hamper
ill be out in a second
she stays still hoping she wont try to come in
footsteps recede and nina breathes
she runs her hands under some water to clean off the blood
david and nina dance the black swans pas de deux
once again ninas rigid and self conscious
try it again
they resume dancing
she finishes out of breath and looks at leroy and the russian ballet mistress
the piano music starts up again and she begins dancing
when she finishes she looks at him eager for feedback
the music starts up again
nina stays still frustrated
do you have any corrections
she doesnt understand
he gets up from his chair and goes to her
lily talked to me
said she saw you crying
nina looks away
cant believe lily talked to him
she said you were upset and i should take it easy on you
i didnt tell her that
maybe youd like a break for a day or two
or a fucking month
she shouldnt have said anything
i dont care
you shouldnt be whining to her
you could be brilliant
taking it easy would be a betrayal
he walks away from her
stop saying that
stop being so damn weak
he tosses his chair across the room
smashing into the wall
furious nina heads towards the soloists dressing room
hears them chatting in their usual manner
nina knocks loudly at the door interrupting them
look whos gracing us with her presence
lily i need to talk to you
youre in trouble ooooh
the other girls giggle
and they do
nina leads lily to a private nook fuming
you told thomas about last night
lily falters guilty
i ran into him this morning
he said you guys were having some trouble
why would he talk to you
whoa your highness i just told him youre working your ass off and im sure youll be great
you shouldnt have done that
i didnt fucking do anything
lily takes off
nina stares after her at a loss
nina sits on the subway going home
she notices that one of her fingernails has a jagged edge
she removes an emory board from her bag and begins filing it down
a skeezy man across the aisle ogles her
nina keeps her eyes down trying to ignore him
he starts to sing an old love song from the s
nina stands and goes to the other end of the car
he continues singing undeterred
nina sits on the floor in a loose sweatshirt sewing ribbon onto pointe shoes
erica sits across from her sewing ribbon onto another pair
has he tried anything with you
nina doesnt respond
he has a reputation
nina tries to ignore her
i have a right to be concerned nina
youve been staying late so many nights
i hope hes not taking advantage thats all
i dont want you making the same mistake i did
not like that
i just mean as far as my career was concerned
the one i gave up to have you
nina bites her tongue
erica glares at her
hows your skin
we leaving it alone
let me see
nina stares back defiantly
take off your shirt
erica starts to come towards her
the doorbell rings
erica looks at nina questioningly
nina shakes her head
erica goes to the door and cracks it open keeping the chain engaged
to person outside can i help you
pause im sorry shes not in
erica shuts the door
nina rushes out to see who it was
who was it
erica doesnt answer
irritated nina walks around erica and quickly opens the door to find out
its no one
nina sees a ballerina walking away from the door
what are you doing here
nina steps out of her apartment and closes the door
i wanted to apologize
nina just stares incredulous
you were right i shouldnt have talked to him about you
erica opens the door and sticks her head out
give me a second
erica closes the door
shes a trip
how did you know where i live
i have my ways
nina looks at her darkly
relax i got it from susie in the office
i feel really shitty
can i make it up to you
take you out to dinner
i dont think a drink
erica pokes her head out again
sweetie you need to rest
nina pushes the elevator call button
nina walks to the door and grabs her coat
what are you doing
im going out
nina ignores her and shuts the door
a noisy bar and burger joint packed to the brim
lily and nina sit at a small table
cant believe thats what he called her
i think its sweet
he probably calls every girl that
well im sure she lost the title after her game of chicken
ninas smile fades
bet hell be calling you little princes any day now
i dont think so
sure just gotta let him eat the pussy
nina blushes embarrassed and lily cracks up
a waiter drops a plate in front of her
cheese burger extra bloody
let me know if its not juicy enough
oh i will
he smiles keeping his eyes locked on lily as he rudely plops down ninas plate
lily watches him go then notices nina looking annoyed
guess im invisible
lily studies her and digs into her purse
pulls out a sexy here wanna spruce up
nina gives her a puzzled look
i always carry a spare case i wake up somewhere unexpected
lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite a little grease dripping down her chin
nina cuts into her dry chicken breast
not like you need more attention these days
how is he
nina doesnt understand the question
i wouldnt know
i dont want to talk about it
relax youre so tense
lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open
inside cigarettes and a couple pills
one for you
lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over
and one for me
lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer
nina stares at her pill too embarrassed to admit she doesnt know what it is
dont worry its pure
brought it with me straight from san francisco
what is it
you never rolled
itll just make you have a good time
see the night sky
how long does it last
nina looks at the pill thinks about it for a second
lily puts the pill back and snaps the case closed
wearing the skimpy shirt lily offered her nina rinses her mouth out with water from the sink then checks herself out in the mirror
its broken and covered with graffiti and stickers
one particularly bright one says seize the day glo
ninas cell phone rings
she checks the id mom and silences it
nina puts her sweatshirt back on over the shirt and exits
nina returns to her table but when she gets there lily is gone and the table is cleared
she looks around the crowded room doesnt see her anywhere
she heads towards the exit and sees lily at the bar flirting with two attractive men
shes very touchy feely
intrigued nina stays put wanting to observe lily from a distance
the bartender sets a drink down in front of lily
the men compete to pay for it
lily takes out the cigarette case from her purse and removes the pill
nina looks on suspicious
lily opens the pill and dumps its contents into the drink
she stirs it with her finger
she holds out her finger to one of the men he sucks off the liquid
lily looks over and catches nina watching
she waves for her to join them
nina reluctantly walks to her
heeey thought we could use some drinks
im gonna go
this is tom and this is jerry
the guys laugh
actually its andrew
you cant leave i bought you a drink
lily holds out the doctored beverage
nina eyes it tempted to go down the rabbit hole
i really shouldnt were on the stage tomorrow
what you gonna go home to mommy
live a little
nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink
just a couple of hours
nina takes a tiny sip
nina takes another sip and smiles
lets go sit somewhere a little more comfortable
she gets up and holds out her hands
the two men each grab one and she leads them deeper into the bar
ninas drink is half gone
the foursome sits snugly at a booth
nina next to andrew shyly avoiding his gaze
she takes another tentative sip of her drink
you havent told me who you are
oh im a dancer
no i mean your name
you two sisters
were blood sisters
we dance in the same company
so thats why you look alike
tom and jerry are gay lovers
oh i just assumed
ive never been to the ballet
in that case youre definitely not gay
its pretty boring isnt it
no its not
its not for everyone
you probably arent sophisticated enough
youve got some mouth you know that
isnt that compliment a little premature
lily sips her drink staring at tom flirtatiously
you guys should come sometime
i can comp you tickets
tom laughs amused by ninas earnestness
thatd be neat
i think we all need another round
she looks at nina and sucks down her drink challenging her to follow suit
nina takes a breath of courage and empties her glass
she waits for something to kick in
tom come with me
lily slips out of the booth and tom follows leaving nina and andrew alone
she avoids his gaze nervous
what are you guys working on these days
her cell phone rings interrupting him
she quickly turns it off and gives him an embarrassed smile
you know it
oh no not really
heard of it though
whats it about
its about a girl whos been turned into a swan
she needs love to break the spell
yeah but her prince falls for the wrong girl and she kills herself
so a happy ending then
its beautiful actually
she starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug
i said youre beautiful
she gives him a flirtatious glance
my hands are all sweaty
andrew touches them
she grabs onto his hands
she looks at his face
his eyes twinkle at her
lily slides in next to her
nina sees her and melts into her body
lily hugs her back
looks like someones rolling
lets get you dancing
nina kisses tom on the floor of a crowded dance club
the drug is in full effect
the world has soft edges colors are vivid and bleed into one another
lily twirls her around
nina attaches herself to her hungry for the attention
a cheering section of guys surrounds them
nina lets loose
dances with abandon
nina makes out with someone her back pushed up against the wall
her eyes are closed shes shiny with sweat
she opens her eyes confused to find that its not andrew or even tom just a strange man
she backs away
he reaches for her but she swats him off
she stumbles around the dance floor looking for lily but only sees a mass of moving bodies
she finally spots a girl that looks like her from behind
nina grabs her shoulder and the girl spins around
nina pushes her way out of the club starting to panic
she looks around trying to figure out where she is but the city is dark and non descript
nina turns towards the voice and with relief sees lily exit the club
where you goin
nina stares adoringly at lily who has her eyes closed enjoying the cool air blowing in from her open window
lily opens her eyes and catches nina staring
using her index and middle finger as legs she walks her hand over the vinyl seat all the way to ninas leg and pokes it
nina watches her hand with a smile on her face glances at lily
lily smiles back and then walks her hand up the leg until it reaches the edge of ninas dress
lily looks at nina questioningly
nina doesnt protest
lily slips her hand underneath the dress gently makes contact
nina shudders but pulls lilys hand back out and holds it
lily snickers and looks out her window
nina looks at their clasped hands then out her own window happy
nina quietly opens the front door
nina shushes her
they slip off their shoes and tip toe inside
nina eases the door shut
lily taps her on the shoulder and points towards the hallway
erica emerges from the darkness approaching them slowly
do you have any idea what time it is
where have you been
to the moon and back
youve been drinking
ding ding ding
lily snickers nina tries to keep a straight face but ends up laughing
what else have you been doing
nina smiles coyly
you want to know their names
erica grabs ninas wrist
you need to sleep it off
there were two
tom and jerry
be quiet nina
i fucked both of them
shut your mouth
erica violently jams her fingers over ninas lips trying to silence her
nina runs into her room and slams the door
she grabs the broken piece of wood from the dresser and jams the door
she backs lily away preparing for the storm
dont come in here
erica tries to open the door but it gets stuck
she peers her eye through the crack
its called privacy
im not fucking twelve years old anymore
erica struggles a little with the door but cant get it to budge
youre not my nina right now
nina shoves the door shut
ericas footsteps retreat followed by the slam of her bedroom door
b nina is worked up breathing hard
nina turns around and sees her double smiling at her
nina flees to the door
she peeks back and sees that its actually lily
relieved she grabs lily and kisses her revved up
lily responds with equal force
they claw at each other passion exceeding coordination
lily pulls ninas shirt off and throws her onto the bed
she straddles nina who looks up at her carnivorously
lily takes her own top off plunges down and kisses nina
nina flips lily over becomes the dominant one
lily scratches ninas back over some of the rash
theres subtle movement underneath the skin
little pin pricks push up the flesh trailing behind her hand
self conscious nina grabs lilys hand and holds her wrists down
she bites her neck
lily smiles likes the violence
she digs her nails into ninas hands
then lily gets back on top of nina
the tattooed lilies on her back undulate and spread out
morphing into dark wings
she kisses down ninas body
further and further
lily starts to go down on nina
nervous nina whimpers
glances down and sees the double
she tries to pull away
lily shushes her
nina calms back down seeing that its her
she takes a breath and succumbs
bumps shoot up all over her skin as her breath quickens
she closes her eyes allows the sensation to invade her body and climaxes
she breathes her way back to earth
slowly her eyes open
she rolls over towards lily
but lily is gone
instead her double hovers over her
she smashes a pillow over ninas face
nina lies alone in bed the sheets and comforter in disarray
she sits up clutches her head in pain
she looks around but theres no sign of lily or the double
then her eyes drift to the alarm clock
she snaps out of bed
dishevelled nina races towards the front door
she sees erica brooding at the kitchen table watching her
why didnt you wake me up
erica just stares at her devastated
im moving out
nina whips out the front door and leaves her
she hears muffled black swan music playing rehearsal clearly in progress
she runs into the wings and sees the full company rehearsing on stage for the first time
another girl dancing her part
the girl spins and nina sees her face
horrified nina runs onto and makes a beeline for leroy looking beyond apologetic
the dancers and piano player stop at the interruption
lets finish the act
the piano music resumes and the dancers pick up where they left off
nina meets lilys eyes
she makes a sorry face but then continues dancing
nina is forced to watch from the sidelines as lily and david finish the black swans pas de deux
that was good
lets take then well move on to act
he turns to nina and his smile fades
get warmed up
thomas im sor he ignores her and walks off stage
lily tentatively approaches with the practice tutu
nina snatches it avoiding eye contact
she puts it on
he wanted to go through the spacing
asked me to step in
nina starts stretching
least you had a good time right
nina doesnt answer
you put something in my drink
and took off this morning
yeah you slept over
unless your names tom and you have a dick
nina stops herself
we what nina
lily can read something on her face
what you have some kind of lezzy wet dream
nina glances at the dancers nervous theyve heard
oh my god you totally fantasized about me
was i good
other dancers look over
nina resumes stretching
lily just walks away
nina dances the end of the ballet the white swans suicide
the black swan has stolen your love
theres only one way to end the pain
nina climbs the stairs of the set and arrives at the cliff stopping at the precipice
youre not at all fearful
filled with acceptance
nina looks down
its a short drop to a stack of pads but a hard floor surrounds it
you look at the prince then down at rothbart and yes up at the audience
she hesitates fearful
youll be fine
nina takes a breath and leaps in a swan dive
and lands in the pads unhurt
slight applause from the other dancers
everybody get a drink then its notes
nina lies in the pads completely exhausted
nina sits backstage toweling herself off
she pauses noticing leroy and lily conversing near the doorway
lily nods and touches his arm
he smiles warmly then notices nina watching
his serious demeanor returns and he pulls away
he says goodbye to lily
lily follows his gaze and smirks at nina rubbing it in before exiting herself
nina kneels in front of the toilet a finger down her throat
she gags but nothing comes up
her eyes tear up and she tries again but still just heaves
frustrated she wipes her mouth and flushes
nina exits the bathroom and approaches her mothers bedroom door
its closed but the lights on underneath
shes about to knock but hesitates
through the door she can hear the sound of her mother watching an infomercial on tv
an unfamiliar lonely noise
nina stands there for a moment just breathing
she strengthens her resolve and backs away from the door
nina collapses on her bed
she opens the jewelry box sitting on her night stand
she watches the ballerina spin for a moment
then suddenly slams the lid shut and throws the box hard against the wall
she shoots out of bed and starts gathering all her childish possessions stuffed animals dolls keepsakes etc
nina shoves her belongings into the trash chute a pile of her next victims strewn at her feet
she grabs a teddy bear in a tutu and jams him in
nina dances the black swan in front of the nearly completed scenery
a few technicians complete last minute touch ups
leroy watches from his down stage post his focus split between her and
lily stretching with the other ballerinas
she stares at nina with a dark expression
fueled by the competition nina pushes herself
her dancing becomes more impassioned and aggressive
she finishes the section breathing deeply covered in sweat
the company enthusiastically claps
she stares intently at leroy awaiting his response
at last i saw the black swan
nina wears the black swan costume facing a mirror
another mirror behind her creates an infinite array of reflections
the overworked costumer checks each seam pulling the costume taut analyzing what needs to be taken in and let out
nina looks uncomfortable disliking the scrutiny of her body
she hears a sharp rustle
like someones scratching
she looks up at the mirror
her reflection stares back
behind the first reflection another nina has her arm behind her back like shes scratching her shoulder
nina leans to get a better look
sit still im almost done
the reflection has returned to normal its hand back at its side
costumer checks one more thing makes one more note
okay all set
the costumer leaves her to change
relieved nina quickly takes off the costume and starts to dress in her sweats
she hears someone enter the costume shop
thomas sent me
nina pauses recognizing her voice
yeah need to get you measured for your swan queen costumes
nina steps out from behind the privacy curtain and finds lily waiting
whats she doing here
he made me your alternate
cant help it just in case
nina pushes past her
nina chases after leroy in mid conversation with the stage manager and two stagehands
he stops and faces her
shes trying to replace me
to stage manager go ahead
ill catch up
they continue walking
whats going on
you made her my alternate
theres always an alternate you know that
lilys the best choice
she wants my role
every dancer in the world wants your role
no shes different
shes after me
shes trying to replace me
please believe me
he studies her for a moment not sure what to make of this
listen i know its been a struggle
but you had a breakthrough this morning
nina starts to speak he holds up his hand to silence her
tomorrow is yours
give a great performance and you wont have to worry about lily or anyone else
go home and rest
shut down she watches him walk away
nina practices the black swan alone with the jaded piano player working herself hard
he suddenly stops playing
i gotta life deary
he closes the music book and stands
dont work too hard
its your big day tomorrow
annoyed she watches him leave
b she faces herself in the mirror and takes a breath
b she resumes dancing without music her feet clicking on the floor
as she moves she notices something strange out of the corner of her eye the reflections dancing lags a little behind hers
the sound of her footsteps stops a second later
she stares at the mirror
the door to the room bangs shut
she whips towards it and shes suddenly plunged into freaked she stumbles towards the door and pushes out into
where its equally dark
lit only by the stages ghost light a single bulb on a stand
im still in here
no one answers
she looks at the cavernous auditorium
all those empty seats faced towards her
she hears a noise in the wings
turn the lights back on
she gets to the other side of the stage but the wings seem empty
b then she hears the faint sound of muffled banging
no one answers
she heads towards the noise
the banging now accompanied by a its pretty dark but the sound is unmistakable two people going at it
nina tiptoes past some off stage sets and lighting equipment
and peeks around a piece of scenery
catching a glimpse of leroy fucking lily further backstage
shes wild clearly enjoying it
nina looks away disgusted
she peeks back one more time
leroy has become the demon rothbart ravishing the double
she meets ninas eyes and smiles
nina jumps back knocking into a piece of the set
the lovemaking pauses at the sound
nina runs in and quickly jams her belongings into her bag
she notices her reflection in the mirror and removes her diamond earrings
then gathers the other trinkets sitting on the counter and puts them all inside her bag
nina pushes out the stage door and passes the row of they now advertise swan lake and feature a beautiful photograph of nina
nina stops and looks at them
nina slowly enters beths room but remains at the threshold
beth sits in a wheelchair faced towards the window
nina gets up the nerve and quietly walks further in trying not to wake her
nina pulls out the tube of lipstick from her bag and gently places it on the hospital table
she pulls out the diamond earrings sets them down
followed by the makeup compact the pack of cigarettes a needle and thread and an emory board
a hand suddenly grabs ninas arm
awake beth stares nina down
what are you doing here
stunned ninas unable to answer
beth follows her gaze to the random items on her table
im so sorry
beth begins touching the objects vaguely remembering
i didnt mean to make you feel this way
its happening to me now
shes trying to replace me
beth sees the earrings and it all clicks in
you stole all these things
i just wanted to be like you
beth shoots nina a dark look and turns away
im not perfect
its not true
beth grabs the emory board and stabs herself in the face
nina spins beth around
she is now a bloody version of the double
she continues stabbing herself
nina grabs the doubles hand and struggles to restrain her
the emory board stabs into ninas arm
nina rushes from the room
she bangs into a empty stretcher sitting in the hallway causing a clamor
the older nurse looks up
nina jumps into an open elevator
she hits the ground floor button and hides in the corner
as the doors close she looks down and sees that in one hand she holds the bloody emory board
she drops it disgusted
nina runs in and quickly shuts the door behind her
takes a breath and notices some blood still on her hands
she flips on the light
the rooms empty
she goes to the sink and washes her hands
she finishes and flips the light off as she walks out of the room
she pauses rushes back and flips on the light
the double stares at her from the corner her face covered in blood
terrified nina runs
she goes straight to the toilet and vomits
she hears a creaking sound in the apartment and looks towards the open door
she goes out to investigate
nina flings open the door but ericas not in there
she hears rustling then whispering
nina looks around the room
the paintings of herself seem to move slightly
they whisper sweet girl and then start chanting my turn my turn my turn
nina cups her hands over her ears trying to block it out
she hears a bang and looks towards the door
no ones there
she glimpses the mirror which reflects down the hallway
she sees her double rushing towards the room
scared nina whips around just as her mother arrives in the doorway
what are you doing
nina pushes past her in a frenzy
nina closes the door
sticks in the broken piece of wood
a pain shoots through her shoulder
she screams instinctively reaching for it
she quickly yanks off the sweater and looks at the vanity mirror
her back pulsates unnaturally
tiny black tips poke through
the door opens and catches on the doorjamb
erica starts pounding
she digs into the open bump on her shoulder with her fingernails
open the door
erica violently pushes and pulls jostling the piece of wood
nina concentrates takes hold of the growth and yanks
blood vessels in her eyes explode making the white turn red
nina looks at the object held in her fingers a sharp tiny black spine
like that of a sea urchin
damp feathery wisps hang off of it
the door flings open
erica rushes in and finds nina half naked her skin inflamed
oh my god
nina starts forcing her out the door
erica pushes back
stop youre sick
she manages to get her all the way out the door
but rothbarts hand grabs the door frame
nina slams the door smashing the hand
erica screams in pain
nina slams the door again and again
the hand now human
she finally gets the door all the way shut
she steps away from it nervous
she looks down sees one of her knees snap backwards like that of a bird
then the other knee snaps back
nina stumbles and falls
and slams her head into the radiator
tinny music plays in the darkness
nina flutters open her eyes
the world comes into focus and she sees her mother hovering over her stroking her hair
sshh shhh its okay
nina looks around disoriented
sees her hands jammed inside thick socks held on by rubber bands
groggy she tries to pull them off
you were scratching all night
erica helps remove the socks her smashed hand wrapped in bandages
nina weakly tries to sit up but erica pushes her back down
nina gives in too tired to fight her
her eyes drift to the source of the tinny music the open jewelry box
the ballerinas been broken off all that remains is a single amputated leg spinning morbidly on the base
ninas eyes drift to the alarm clock
wheres the clock
nina looks at the dark window
what night is it
nina reads ericas face
reality clicks in
what time is it
nina tries to sit up but her mother pushes her back down
i have to go
i called the theater and told them you werent feeling well
nina freaks struggles more violently
no i want to
get off me
nina squirms free of ericas grasp and gets out of bed
she gets to the door
but the doorknobs been knocked off leaving just a metal post sticking out of the hole
were staying in here until you feel better
nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls shaking the door
where is it
erica calmly sits down in her chair waiting for the storm to pass
this role is destroying you
nina rifles through her dresser drawers
she notices her mother sitting calmly
nina grabs her by the wrist
what happened to my sweet girl
nina yanks erica off the chair onto the floor
please youre not well
under the cushion nina grabs the hidden brass doorknob
erica lunges for her daughters legs
you cant handle it
im the fucking swan queen
you never even got out of the corps
you fucking ungrateful nina jams the knob onto the post opens the door
nina approaches the theater with harried steps
quickly past the row of swan lake posters
she reaches the side of the building flings open the stage door and enters
nina frantically makes her way down the bustling hallway chaotic with dancers
excitement in the air
she nears the soloists dressing room
just outside of it she spots a group of dancers excitedly chatting around a smiling lily
nina stops in her tracks
lily glances in her direction and her smile quickly fades into a sneer
what are you doing here
the other girls follow her gaze towards nina and their smiles turn to confusion
she turns and finds that leroy has approached from behind her
youre supposed to be sick
lily give us a minute
leroy pulls nina towards her room
lily glares at nina as she passes
leroy closes the door behind them
he looks at nina wheels spinning
are you okay
nina goes to her wardrobe finds her two costumes hanging
one for the white swan one for the black swan
she doesnt heed him pulls out the white swan leotard and sets it on her chair
i already asked lily fuck
have you announced it
after beth do you need more controversy
leroy smirks at her directness
im here thomas
im doing it
he looks at her considering and gives her a reluctant nod
the only person standing in your way is you
its time to let her go
he takes one last look at her and leaves
she breathes a sigh of relief
curious she cracks open the door and peeks outside leroy has pulled lily down the corridor to break the news
lily takes off furious
through the pa music from act plays
nina sits at her vanity in a robe wearing the full white swan makeup and feather crown
pale with red lipstick and dark eyeliner she looks like a porcelain doll
she drops the robe off her shoulder and covers her rash with white makeup
the stage managers voice comes through the pa speaker act s starting
she removes a slipper off one foot
her big and second toe and her pinky and fourth toe are stuck together
puzzled she peels them apart
she removes her other slipper and finds the same toes completely fused forming two large toes with double toenails on either side of the middle toe
she touches the bird like foot concerned but slips on her tights and hides the feet
nina stretches nervously in the wings awaiting her entrance
she peeks out through a small hole in the wall sees the audience sitting expectantly in their seats
the music begins and they shift and mummer in anticipation
nina pulls away taking deep breaths and clenching her hands trying to stay calm
on stage david enters beginning the act
he traverses the stage hunting with a crossbow
nina takes a last breath and runs on
under the spotlight she begins dancing her intro
david runs towards her and she startles away from him afraid
he grabs her and they begin their first pas de deux
nina comes offstage catching her breath
all around her corps members dressed as little swans rush back on stage where four little swans begin the pas de quatre
nina looks into the opposite wing and sees leroy watching her
he gives her a small contented nod then disappears behind a swarm of dancers
on stage the four little swans perform
in their identical makeup and costumes they look disturbingly alike
during the applause nina catches a glimpse of david backstage sweaty laughing and holding someones hands
nina cant see who her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs
suspicious nina moves to get a better look
revealing that davids flirting with lily
then the four little swans rush offstage past nina
she watches them go unsettled
what are you doing
he gently nudges her and she has to run back on
nina rushes from the wings directly into davids arms
all the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the stage looking downstage
david launches nina into the air hands around her waist
he slowly turns her around keeping her held high
from her swirling birds eye view nina sees the rows of identically dressed little swans glaring at her
nina freaks jerking her body
davids grip slips and nina slams onto the stage
its a horrific moment that feels like an eternity
gritting her teeth nina looks up around her sees the faces of the other ballerinas
staring at her sadistically
nina finds lily glancing at david
he snaps to and quickly helps nina up
what the fuck
shes too freaked to respond
they resume dancing nina barely keeping it together
behind them rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit
the little swans start swirling off stage
leaving nina and david alone
david tries to pull her in one direction but the dark hand of rothbart summons her transforming her back into a swan
she pulls away from david frantically flapping until she disappears into the wings
as soon as shes off she breaks down hyperventilating
the dancer playing rothbart eyes her with concern
she looks up sees his creepy mask and backs away
rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the act
other corps members surround her chirping you okay
dazed nina doesnt answer
the music ends and theres a weak smattering of applause
act in fifteen
the other dancers scurry to get ready abandoning her
nina sees leroy on stage chewing david out behind the closed curtain
david spots nina glares at her and sulks away
leroy runs his fingers through his hair his back to nina
nina cautiously approaches
it wasnt my fault
he dropped me
he cant even look at her
what a fucking disaster
he walks away
all alone nina sees everyone backstage looking at her
she runs escaping their stares
she closes the door behind her ready to cry
she looks up and finds lily putting on makeup and wearing the black swan costume
rough start huh
get out of here
lily coyly smiles and continues applying makeup
im worried about the next act
not sure youre feeling up to it
i dance the black swan for you
nina looks into the mirror
instead of lilys reflection theres the double
leave me alone
leave me alone
but its my turn
ninas fury rises up from inside
leave me alone
and smashes her into the wall length mirror shattering it
shards fall everywhere
the double flips nina over and wails on her
punch after punch
nina does her best to block the onslaught
they scuffle knocking things over bumping into walls
the double gets her hands around ninas neck
gasping for air nina tries to pull the hands free but shes too strong
her hands frantically scramble along the surface of the floor
the fingers barely touch the edge of a mirror shard but cant grasp it
the double squeezes down
the blood vessels in ninas eyes burst again
her neck starts to stretch unnaturally
strength surges through her body and she lunges
finally grabbing the shard
and drives it into the doubles stomach
nina glances at her hand cut by the mirror then back up
the double is now lily
stunned lily looks down and touches the stab wound
its my turn
lily coughs up blood and collapses dead
nina stares at her breathing heavily high on adrenaline
a knock on the door
black swan places in
nina drags the stiffening body into the wardrobe closet
nina zips up the back to the black swan costume
she deliberately applies the black swan makeup
dark eye shadow and rouge maroon lipstick
dressed in black and wearing the dark make up of the black swan she looks fierce
she stares at her reflection her eyes burning red
new rash bumps pop up on her arms the intensity building within
nina bursts onto stage as the black swan accompanied by rothbart
she looks powerful intense as she moves towards david
his face shows his surprise
nina dances the first pas de deux with him
they finish and she walks away from him
alone she looks at her arms sees black points trying to push through again
some fully emerge as shiny black feathers
she just watches them not panicking but accepting the transformation taking place
even beckoning it
her second entrance cue is played
she leaps back on for the coda
she takes a brief pause closing her eyes once more and then completely lets herself go
she spins with ferocity
more black feathers burst out from her shoulders and back
at last she truly embodies the black swan
she finishes the coda punctuating her last spin with a sharp step that echoes through the theater
the audience looks on mesmerized
too stunned to clap at first
d nina looks down at the stage her face glazed with sweat d she has returned to normal
she finally looks up at the audience and they erupt in a standing ovation
nina walks to the front of the stage takes her bow
nina looks up at the mass of bodies filling the auditorium vibrating with applause
proud nina smiles and bows again
again and again
she finally runs off stage the applause still going strong
nina enters the wings other dancers cheer loudly
even veronica and galina
she pushes past all the smiling faces
it feels very surreal
she sees leroy clapping and shaking his head
get back out there
get back she stops his mouth with a kiss
the kind of kiss that you cant stop
not desperate but adamant
finally she disengages staring at him in the eyes but before he can say anything
she turns and rushes back on stage
like hes been run over by a truck
she walks towards her dressing room a satisfied smile on her face
she passes the stage manager
you got fifteen til the last act
she nods and arrives at her room
she opens the door makes sure no ones looking and enters quickly
she closes the door behind her locks it
turns and sees the broken glass all over the floor
she eyes the closed wardrobe
a pool of blood drips out from under the door
she picks up a towel and lays it over the blood
she starts to undress
back in the white swan costume she re applies the makeup
theres a knock on the door
she looks towards it her face only halfway made up
she goes to the door opens it just a crack
she peeks through and finds
lily looking back at her
you were amazing
im sorry things got so messed up between us
just holy shit totally blown away
nina barely manages a nod
anyway wanted to tell you
ill let you finish
lily turns and walks away
nina swiftly shuts the door
she turns around stares at the wardrobe
she steps cautiously towards it her face repeated countlessly in all the reflective shards
she lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it
it is clean
she looks down at the floor
no blood there either
she slowly opens the door to the wardrobe
and finds it empty
no body whatsoever
she looks over at the broken mirror
sees her reflection staring back at her
she stares at it for a long beat and realizes something
she touches her stomach and winces a little
pulls back her hand
its coated with red liquid
its started to soak through the costume creating a faint red spot
the fabric is ripped at the center of the stain
she feels inside for confirmation
and discovers a stab wound in her own stomach
she pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside
blood begins flowing more rapidly
she drops the mirror
on the pa white swan in
in a daze she sits down at the vanity and finishes applying the rest of the white swans makeup
nina dances the final pas de deux as the white swan
losing blood by the second everything is woozy and blurry
she cant do all the steps but her performance is pained making it poignant
a spot of red begins to soak through at the center of her costume
the music turns ominous and von rothbart the evil sorcerer comes onto stage
nina dances away from him back upstage towards the cliff
its time for her final leap
her energy fading she teeters up the stairs of the set
one step at a time
she gets to the top takes one last look around at all the eyes watching her
she notices a familiar face in the audience her mother
she watches with a profound sadness tears streaking her cheeks
in the front of ninas costume a dark circle has started to form
her blood fully seeping through
and nina leaps
she falls through an endless void her eyes closed
she slowly twists around in the air so that shes falling backwards
she hears something
soft and muffled
the faint sound of applause
c she lands slowly and comfortably on padding
c the sound of applause is now loud uproarious
a group of ballerinas surround the mattress clapping for her each one dressed as a white swan
leroy pushes through the group to get to her
listen to them
they love you
get up get up
i always knew you had it in you little princess
go take your bow
nina is too weak to move
lily pushes her way into the group and gasps pointing at ninas abdomen
leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood which has grown in size
what did you do
i felt it
oh my god
someone get help
leroy looks back at her
it was perfect
the applause grows more and more faint
her eyes glaze over and everything goes completely silent
nina lies there motionless a smile frozen on her face
