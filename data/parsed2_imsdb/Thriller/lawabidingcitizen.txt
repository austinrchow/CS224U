written by frank darabont kurt wimmer opening credit sequence
images and sounds are surreal dreamlike disturbing a hand is trying to dial three simple numbers
trembling fingers miss try again
we hear boop boop boop
filtered operator what is your emergency
the phone rises gripped tightly
were tight its dark we see no face just slack trembling lips
whoever it is he cant talk
all we hear is breathing all we sense is grief and panic and deep shock
can you hear me
can you speak
can you speak up
lights appear like phantoms over blacktop flashing
police cars coming our way
sir what is the nature of your emergency
the man cant speak
are you injured
do you need medical attention
the cars blast by us
police vehicles converge in slow motion dreamlike
doors fly open cops jump out weapons drawn as we move with them to front door
ramp to normal camera speed as it opens revealing benson clyde phone still gripped
he barely registers the weapons aimed at his face
camera closes in on him as she cant
close her eyes
hes pulled from frame
camera keeps moving following cops into the house
dark as hell inside
arms training weapons
moving up a tight hallway emerging into
where the flashlight beams find blood spatter patterns
furniture shattered and overturned
a kids sneaker
the flashlights play across two bodies in the wreckage a womans pale hand a childs motionless leg
camera drifts around to the cops faces as unsnaps shoulder radio dispatch we have multiple s need full response
chaotic now vehicles and lights
the eye of the storm is clyde on the lawn hugging his knees fetal with horror and grief
hes screaming at the sky but no sound is coming out
ems techs enter shot steal the frame race toward the door
tracking shot at floor level photos being taken
flashes bathe the foreground wreckage
forensic techs step gingerly
uniformed cops hang grimly back hugging the walls
camera brings us to closeup a profile in deep shadow in the foreground face tilted obliquely in the wreckage
a camera flash reveals the face with shocking glare and the image freezes
a ten year old girl eyes open staring at us
prelap her eyes
thats how they were
open like that
clyde is seated speaking slowly and precisely
angle widens revealing the room light filtering through blinds as when i found my wife and child dead my little girls eyes were open
pause the last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life
can you understand that
yes i can
looks to somebody else you
i dont see this helping
angle has now widened drifted to include d
jonas cantrell senior attorney for the state
he wears thick glasses and is suffering the early stages of macular degeneration
i have a son and daughter
both in college
my daughter was ten
i married late in life
clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table
angle comes around to reveal the third man in the room the d
under cantrell focused exceptional at what he does the man youd want on your side
nick doesnt answer stays focused on the task ive seen the crime scene photos mr
but they dont alter the facts of the case
those men are guilty
both of them
you know they are
this isnt about what we know
its about what we can prove in court
things have gone against us
tainted crime scene evidence thrown out
maybe you just havent tried hard enough
weve had only one real break in this case
the fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole
in return for immunity
so he gets away with it
the other man doesnt
hell go down for the crime
that has to count for something
it counts for half
pause quietly dont reward one of the men who murdered my family
i cant claim to know what its like to be in your position
losing your wife and child
but please try to grasp how limited our options are
this is how the justice system works
clyde sits for a long moment numb absorbing this
i see my mistake
i came for justice
instead i got a system
sarah lowell fresh out of law school is waiting anxiously for the meeting to end arms full of file folders
with her is bill reynolds the defense attorney in this case glancing impatiently at his watch
clyde exits the room fast not watching where hes going accidentally plowing into sarah as he passes
on he goes
nick and cantrell exit the room
youre due upstairs in three minutes
youre gonna be late
thank you voice of doom
they move toward the elevators with reynolds
sarahs at their heels sensing the tension and keeping her mouth shut
to cantrell we doing the right thing
jumps in you even doubt it
cmon you didnt just tumble off the fucking truck
do the math
cantrell has trouble seeing the elevator button misses
nick presses it for him
this is thrown away without comment both men are used to cantrells bad eyes by now
they elevator opens they get on
and ride up its your office
its your decision
nick shoots him a withering look glances back at sarah
what do you think
what are you asking her for
shes just an intern
deer in the headlights i am just an intern
you were top of your class at yale dont give me that shit
someday you might have our jobs
you know the issues of the case before the court
you can take both men to trial spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars and probably lose
or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row
its a no brainer
you make the deal
smug to the men duh
they trade a look
cantrell glances to sarah
when the day comes that you argue a real case in court you might refrain from summing up with duh
ill avoid that
judge laura burch presides
nick cantrell sarah are present
clarence darby is the focus bill reynolds at his side
the agreement has been vetted by both sides
satisfactory to all
yes your honor
state also approves your honor
nick places a document before darby along with a pen
this document guarantees that you will provide testimony against rupert ames in the matter of which you were both accused
in return you will be shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes
but you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering
youll do a maximum of five years
with good behavior you could be out in three
that also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation
your honor need not worry on my account
i assure the court that i am aware of the opportunity ive been given
and i am deeply grateful to all concerned
nick gives cantrell a glance both stoically enduring this proceeding
darby pulls the document closer
if i may
it has come to my attention that rupert ames has been spreading lies about me to the tabloid press
about certain alleged activities of which i have no knowledge
sexual and otherwise
libel and slander
dryly you can always sue him
well no matter
my tongue will wag in court under oath
his tongue will wag in hell
he puts pen to paper looks to nick
hell get the chair
we dont do chair
we do needle
cathedral like pigeons fluttering
the door from the hallway opens and betsy a months old german shepherd puppy bounds toward us on a leash pulling cantrell toward the top of the vast marble staircase
nick trails them nervous as hell whoa jonas take my elbow
im not blind
ill do it
youre shitty on stairs
at least let me take the leash so the dog doesnt pull you down
she needs to imprint on me
not you not somebody else
cantrell starts down
nicks at his side hovering and ready to grab him jumping at every little lurch cantrell makes
thats the whole point of this phase
she needs to get the idea that she and i are partners
then the real training can begin
unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life
nick and cantrell emerge into daylight and find darby in the protective custody of a federal marshal on the courthouse steps surrounded by a crush of reporters it was a
burglary gone wrong
we thought the house was empty
rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy
i was stoned and in fear of my own life so i fled
they catch sight of bill reynolds the defense attorney
you let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps
hellooo kettle to pot
since when do you shy away from publicity
since everything in this case has gone sideways so far
tell your boy to save it for the courtroom
hes your boy too now
you tell him
reynolds proceeds down the steps
and vanishes in the crowd
nick glances sourly toward darby
and may i say for the record how very sorry i am that i failed to prevent rupert ames from committing those terrible crimes
you good here
long as nobody bumps into me
camera follows nick through the crowd toward darby
been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me
to atone for my past failings and weakness of character
it is a gift given me by gods grace
darby sees nick grabs his hand shaking it for the cameras
and the grace and wisdom of this court
i cannot thank you enough sir
a barrage of camera flashes
nick caught off guard before the press darby not letting go
then nick sees clyde a tiny defeated figure far below waits at the bus stop
hes gazing up seeing this photo op happen
breaks the handshake with a flush of discomfort signals the federal marshal marshal escort your man please
to the reporters mr
darby is done here
darby is hustled down the steps
the reporters surge to nick surrounding him shouting questions
nick looks over their heads and glimpses clyde getting on a bus
the door closes the bus pulls away
he drops his briefcase by the door
reflected in the mirror kell nicks wife is just out of the bath wearing a robe and toweling her hair
nick enters behind her
she cranes back for a kiss keeps toweling her hair in the mirror
he hugs her from behind buries his face in her neck
pause hows she doing
she drove me a little crazy today
she was busy
he reaches around slowly unties her robe pulls it open
revealing her pregnant belly
our angles have avoided this till now
he places his hand feeling for movement
of course she stops kicking the moment you get home
slow tracking shot finds them in bed nick with his head on kells chest
i had to say some things to a man today i didnt want to say
and i did something i didnt want to do
you didnt lie to him
or bullshit him
or shine him on
none of those things
so you had your reasons
you did what you had to
its not your fault the world sucks
nick smiles eases his face to her belly
you in there
your mother just said the world sucks
you may wanna rethink this whole thing
if youre asking
just stay in there
i promise you nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now
what is wrong with you
plus theres shit you dont need to know about
madonnas entire back catalog
did someone drop you on your head
i have swollen ankles and all i do is pee
that babys coming out
weighs that okay
im sure you heard that
then again there are the beatles
be a shame to miss those
beat getting serious all right kid
bring it on
but when youre old enough for the world to disappoint you i hope you wont blame your old man for bringing you into this mess
give me that at least
nick and kell asleep
shes no longer pregnant its now ten years later
a long beat of quiet
a small face peers in from the hallway
emma their year old daughter
she darts in puts her face to nicks
you know what it is
hollering she jumps up on the bed bouncing up and down and dancing around hollering at the top of her lungs nick and kell are too groggy to do anything
but ride it out
emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door hollering all the way up the hallway nick and kell are left groping with blankets heart rates and consciousness glad
its once a year
nick and emma finishing breakfast getting ready to leave kell packing emmas lunch at the counter why cant you be here
its a work thing
you know that happens sometimes
draws sneakily close he claps his hand over her mouth
i believe weve established that
i let go youll stop reminding me
she nods he lets go well celebrate this weekend
tonight is all about your friends
knock yourselves out dont give mom any grief
ill try to be home in time to tuck you in okay
but what are you doing tonight that is more important than
shes doing that sneakily drawing close thing again
nick holds up his finger cautioning her to say it quietly
leans in whispers my birthdaaaaay
something hed get out of if he could
emma grabs her stuff kisses dad races from the room
kell grabs her keys to follow kisses nick goodbye
cars are traveling an old service road
nicks in back with cantrell
the years have left cantrell blind his glasses are beyond coke bottle thick
between them sits betsy the german shepherd now ten years old wearing a guide dog harness
she looks miserable wearing a big cone shaped post surgery collar
how long she have to wear this stupid thing
till the stitches heal
week or two
nick dotes on the dog theyre old pals poor honey
sucks doesnt it
but youre very pretty
yes you are
even with a radar dish on your head
there they are
angle shifts to sarah much more confident and power suited than last time we saw her riding up front with the driver
the car pulls up to the gate as camera rises to reveal the new facility positioned right next to the old one
the condemned rupert ames is placed against the upright execution table and buckled in
the table is tilted back to vertical
all rupert can do is lay there and watch as medical techs swab his arms with alcohol prepare the needles find his veins
the needles are inserted taped off
lines are attached
the techs leave the room
the curtain is drawn aside revealing the big window that separates the chamber from nick and his colleagues are among several dozen witnesses seated in chairs
they watch as warden iger faces rupert
do you have anything to say
rupert doesnt have much of an iq and hes scared shitless but he does his best im here
clarence darby aint
and that aint right
cause that man is evil aint no other way to say it
all them things he done and him turn witness against me for it
he pauses trying to untangle his thoughts
i did wrong too
i guess ill pay up
but it was always him sayin jump and how high and i just went along
now hes killin me and he got you people to do it
and thats a shame
a goddamn shame
pause and i guess thats all
nick trades a look with sarah
cantrell is stoic
warden iger nods to two guards manning the lethal injection machine on which eight oversized glass cylinders in a vertical row are the main feature filled with various clear liquids
there are two switches one a dummy the other live no way to know which is which
the guards power up the machine
lights activate on the board
each man grabs a switch waits
nick watches the wall clock
it hits oclock
the warden nods and the guards flick their switches quickly leaving the room
the warden follows them out closes the door
we hear the pumps quietly activate
rupert is taking shallow breaths terrified
then lays back to wait
plunger one slowly descends emptying its contents into the i
rupert sags as the fast acting barbiturate spreads through his veins
his breathing slows
his head drops back
he loses consciousness
plunger two depresses sending the second vial of liquid into the i
lines with a quiet whir of pumps
plunger three activates
then plunger four
the row of cylinders emptying in sequence
rupert lies unconscious just drifting away
he suddenly comes to
he draws in a long shaky breath
it catches in his throat
his eyes go wide
his entire body starts to clench against some increasing pain
nick is surprised uncertain
betsy starts growling softly at cantrells side
her head comes up hackles rising
nick glances to the dog
then to iger sees the stunned look on the wardens face
something is definitely wrong
the pumps keep whirring the plungers keep descending
rupert he throws his head back mouth wide
the witnesses go tense confused what the hell
ah ah jesus dont that hurt
rupert looks down at his arms his expression turning to sheer horror because the veins are turning angry red then blackening as the liquids course through them
those are last coherent words he speaks
from then on hes just shrieking and bouncing against his straps because his veins are starting to smoke
noxious and foul
the flesh starts giving away blood eating though skin like acid
shock sweeps the onlookers oh jesus
whats going on
people are on their feet
horror and incomprehension
nick goddamn it what
i dont know
rupert is fast becoming a horror its going down his arms and legs up his neck infusing his ears a nauseating discoloration courses through his body using his veins as
a road map going from red to yellow to black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes
people in the room scream turning away
nick pushes his way to the viewing glass shouting at the techs the techs dash into the chamber but are instantly gagging and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from
they retreat coughing pulling the door shut again
ruperts screams spew forth toxic fumes
breath blows smoke from his nostrils
hes arching against his restraints so hard that bones begin snapping blood spewing and smoking through his skin
all nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a cloudy toxic haze
drained and waiting nick sitting against the town car
cantrell across from him with betsy at his side the guide dog will always be at his side in this movie specified or not
emergency lights are swirling all around them
a parade of people descends detective dunnigan sarah warden iger cops prison staff
intense were still trying to sort through this thing
gentlemen we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come
we need answers
start with what we know
lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order
somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else
off their looks industrial solvent
lets not guess let forensics do its job
how could the chemicals be switched
were in a goddamn prison
ill ask because somebody has to
is there any chance no matter how remote that this was an accident
a mix up
weird shit happens
a beat of awkward silence
the warden hesitating
the bad part
dunnigan brings our group in
electricians huddle at an array of circuits and trunk lines
in the dancing flashlight beams some kind of bypass on the phone lines
nick sees a circuit board spliced into the wiring
twenty minutes before the execution the prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails
cell service went dark too
signal was probably jammed
the bad part
i was just on with the governors office
he commuted rupert ames sentence
they were trying to call us to stop the execution
they couldnt get through
nick and cantrell are stunned as this sinks in
the governors incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls
cantrell removes his glasses rubs his eyes
softly oh fuck me
one more thing
dunnigan aims his maglight and swings the junction box cover all the way open
scrawled on the inside of the door in red are the words his tongue will wag in hell
this mean anything to you
camera pushes in on nick
nicks laptop sits on an unmarked car streaming the d
s database by wireless
nick taps the keys as clarence darby
thats what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight
his tongue will wag in hell
those very words
it was ten years ago
i remember it too
some things stick in your head
check the court transcripts theyre public record
darbys mugshot ten years ago scans up along with pertinent info of that time
garza dunnigans partner peers at it
i know this prick
im pretty sure hes one of our c
surprised looks are traded
you think or you know
thats not the name he uses now
but im pretty sure hes one of bernsteins informants
okay raise bernstein i want everything hes got including an address
we roll with tactical
how about i ride along
give you a fast accurate id on this guy
is that necessary
you said yourself we should move fast
this thingll be all over the morning news cycle
wed all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then
off cantrells look
aerial shot angling down to find a convoy of police vehicles speeding across a bridge
dunnigan riding shotgun
nick in back putting on a tactical vest
a transmission comes over the cars dashboard computer a murky nighttime shot of a man in sunglasses and hawaiian shirt
is that clarence darby
i think so
hard to tell
dunnigan scrolls the classified police data pertaining to the informant dates number of convictions attributed
jesus look at this
no wonder bernstein loves him
we scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years
almost a shame to bag the guy
a snort from nick
the cops glance back
hes helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars
i can read a c
what i see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade
so you cops look the other way
he gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions
isnt that what you did ten years ago
give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction
off nicks look maybe we played this asshole to our advantage on the street but youre the one who put him there
so no offense but you might wanna go fuck yourself a little
nick stares at the man on the dashboard computer screen
who is indeed clarence darby naked and drenched with sweat taking a hit off a crack pipe
a womans hand flails up into frame trying to grab for it
he sucks in a full breath hands the pipe off to lisa the thin tattooed skank hes got bent over his bed and is fucking from behind
she flares the bowl with a lighter barely registering any reaction as he keeps pumping her
this shit makes you soft baby
thrusting grimacing thank you
for stating the obvious
he grits his teeth
he sags catching his breath and glances at the plasma tv screen which has been playing silently
he grabs the remote unmutes the set rumors the execution did not go well due to technical flaws but that has yet to be confirmed
did not go well
way to go rupert
you even fucked up dying
you know that guy
cell phone rings he answers
somebody who doesnt want to see you in jail
look out your window
darby hesitates argue later
do it now
darby goes to the window
headlights in the distance
lots of them
he grabs binoculars off the sill
racing this way
no lights no sirens
lowers the binoculars stunned
theres a world of shit coming your way
id get out the back
click line dead
darby frozen for a moment looking around at all the drugs and paraphernalia
he scrambles tossing on his pants grabbing his shirt
lisa jumps off the bed what
she goes to the window sees cars sweeping from the darkness
are those fucking cops
darby lunges to a bookcase grabs a revolver from behind the books sails out the bedroom door
and races down the steps with lisa at his heels
you aint leaving me here
she catches him halfway across the room holding him back
he smashes the gun into her face repeatedly
and knocks her bleeding and crying to the floor
he sails on through the kitchen leaving her there
and bursts through the screen door fleeing barefoot across the back yard as vehicles and cops swarm the front of the house
a cruiser nails him with a spotlight over car speakers you
freeze right there
darby never slowing swings his arm around firing his revolver blindly at all the lights
whoa fuck gunshots
cops scramble and dive
nick has just gotten out of dunnigans car a cruisers window takes a blind hit nearby exploding glass
nick ducks total shock out of his element
drawing dunnigan throws him to the ground
darby runs like an amped up rat in a maze hearing cop cars in the night engines roaring tires squealing
suddenly the sound of a helicopter above
darby dashes for cover against a garage lost in shadow
a massively bright searchlight sweeps from above probing
darby crouches heart hammering watching the searchlight scan over rooftops
his phone rings he answers ditch the gun
wipe the prints
kiss my ass
i heard six shots
bring extra ammo
darby glances at the gun realizing
he bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration fuck
you shot at cops
thats attempted murder if they find the gun on you
youre in deep enough without that
darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail as youll need my help getting out
whatll it cost me
well discuss terms later
go south across th
past the el tracks
alley behind the clinic
take his ride he wont give you any trouble
how do you know
cause i tasered his ass
you gonna keep asking questions
click line dead
darby breaks cover heaves the gun into somebodys yard keeps moving
chaotic with cops and lights
lisa is dragged out shrieking and bleeding her face a broken mess
angle to nick watching it all unfold
he sees dunnigan approach no way hes getting out of this neighborhood
darby finds a police cruiser parked in the moonlight window down
a local cop is sprawled across the front seat
groaning coming to
darby jumps in passenger side wrestles the cop upright
he yanks the cops service revolver slapping him awake
darby reaches over and keys the engine to life
ill put your brains on the dash
disoriented dont shoot
dont hurt me okay
depends on you
the cop hits the gas
tense moments go by as they accelerate up a dark road
darby ducks as cop cars stream past
dunnigan and nick tense hearing a voice over the radio heavily filtered air unit three
see no sign of suspect
think we lost him
keys mic keep sweeping the area unit three
to tactical commander go house to house
garages dumpsters storm drains
you gotta be kidding me
dunnigan angry at a loss doesnt reply
cops are scrambling in all directions
nick turns steps toward camera into a tight shot gazing off into the darkness
something very weird just happened here but he has no idea what
softly how could we lose him
tracks and factories remote and deserted
far away the police copter is still buzzing searching
the police cruiser appears stops
darby emerges with gun and flashlight leveled motions for the cop to get out
the cop complies with hands raised shaking
in the ditch
dont kill me
darby shoves him stumbling into the ditch
the cop sinks to his knees and starts to weep
ill never see my wife and little girl again
ill never see them
its fucked up
darby steps closer draws the hammer back takes aim for a head shot
but his phone rings
he pulls it fast
this my guardian angel
on his knees in the muck the cops quiet weeping becomes soft laughter
he brings up a cell phone speaks into it i see you got out okay
darby draws back confused gun still aimed
the cop snaps his cell phone shut rises to face him
you know why ill never see my wife and daughter again
he takes his hat off peels his moustache away
darby pins him with the flashlight finally and fully revealing you took them from me
recognition floods darby
he pulls the trigger and nothing
just a click darby freezing a hiss of pain
clyde reaches for the gun pries open darbys fingers pulls it from his grasp
revealing the tiny needles that sprang from the pistols grip into darbys palm
darby stares at his perforated palm
his knees give out and clyde catches him eases him to the ground
angle a head encased in a hood
the hood is pulled off revealing darby eyes wide lying on a rough table
benson clyde leans over him checks his pupils
he displays the prop gun rigged with the needles
it paralyzes you but leaves all other neurological functions intact
he sets the gun down starts rooting through some instruments that darby cant see though hes straining to
that means you cant move
but you can see
busying himself that last ones important
you can feel everything
glances at bottled drugs got some other items here
drugs to revive you in case you pass out
stuff like that
darby almost manages to speak thrashing weakly
clyde leans over checks his pupils again
wearing off a little
he tucks a padded block under darbys head like a pillow raising his head so he can see better
clyde moves down the table tightens straps holding darby down
but the worst part tourniquets are tied on darbys arms and legs at various points
darby sees them and starts hyperventilating
dont want you bleeding out
this will take a while
clyde puts on a thick coat like a meat packers
he returns sorting implements darby trying to see
clyde obliges him holding things up pliers teeth
bolt cutter fingers
in case you insist on shutting your eyes
darbys screaming but with the tetrototoxin in his system all thats coming out is air like a slow leak
clyde picks up an object unfolds it a full body plastic coat
he puts it on over his other coat as earlier on the phone
i said id get you out
you asked me what it would cost
he finishes buttoning up crosses back to the table raises a new object into view a circular power saw
well start with an arm and a leg
go from there
the reality of what hes about to do washing over him ive been waiting to say that line for years
but it wasnt very funny was it
played much better in my head
maybe its my delivery
he puts a construction site face protector atop his head the kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down
he turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching up to the ceiling
he feeds the cord and a full length mirror tilts down horizontally above the table
darby finds himself staring straight up into it hell see everything
the cameras lcd screen looms large in our shot
the lcd is dark the camera inactive
its mounted high on a tripod aimed down at the table
clyde approaches b
my hearts beating
he flips his visor down dark no face visible
he reaches up turns the camera on
the lcd screen activates
angle closes in until all we see is the lcd image
grainy in low light
clyde now faceless behind the visor crosses to the squirming figure on the table
we hear the circular saw build to a high shriek
and the shrieking saw fades
the blackness opens up were in a cop cars trunk looking up as the lid is opened
a figure in a meat packing coat looms over us faceless and scary behind a dark face protector
reveals officer hilts hand cuffed and duct taped
hes spent the night in here
he recoils terrified and blinded by glare
the figure opens a wicked sharp butterfly knife click clacks it open
he leans down slits the tape binding hilts arms drops the keys in the cops hands
the police cruiser sits on a dirt road a female dispatchers voice issuing softly and incessantly from the radio unit twenty one come in
unit twenty one please respond
report your location
the mysterious figure strides from the police cruiser to a midnight blue lincoln continental in superb condition shrugging off his thick coat
he gets in hits the gas
hilts struggles to uncuff himself in the cruisers trunk arms and legs cramping as the lincoln becomes a cloud of dust receding in the distance
cleaning up the aftermath of the party nick up on a step stool taking down the birthday banner kell in her robe feeding the dishwasher emma zooming in and out
shuttling paper plates and plastic cups into a big trash bag
and while we were singing karaoke ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face
i saw it coming
and suddenly she just went barf
total puke moment
and we were all like ewwww gross
it was so funny
shes out of the kitchen to grab more stuff
kell starts preparing a bowl of cereal for emma
funny for her
i cleaned it up
i had my ewwww gross moment last night too
i had a house full of shrieking ten year old girls
i saw a guys veins dissolve
its not a competition
off his look okay you win
emma re enters dumping more trash so tara says thats what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made ashley puke again
the doorbell rings
kell glances out the window
grabs her cereal ill get it
she runs out
nick comes off the step stool gratefully accepts a cup of coffee from kell
he suddenly freezes notices the kitchen tv is playing cnn a top of the hour story on the rupert ames execution and foul up
weve gone national
at the front door a messenger hands emma a gift basket trailing mylar balloons with happy birthday emma on them
she closes the door turns toward us finds a cardboard envelope on the basket a card
she opens it finds not a card
an unlabeled dvd
local sheriffs not city cops are spreading out across the fields beating the grass looking for clues
angle to officer hilts blanket draped and still rattled by his night long ordeal being interviewed by a sergeant the suspect who tasered you last night
was it the same person who let you out of the trunk this morning
i never saw a face
he wore a thing a face shield
suddenly we hear a distant voice shouting in panic sergeant
everybodys gaze snaps up tense
across the fields a young cop is stumbling away from a distant farm shed pointing come quick
you gotta see this
nick at the table with kell riveted to cnn state officials including iger are being grilled in a media frenzy
cantrell was right its a shitstorm of scrutiny
emma munching her bowl of breakfast cereal slots the dvd in the player
she backs up hits play with the remote
an image appears on screen grainy
emma looks perplexed
its not a normal dvd more like a bad home movie a figure in a plastic coat and face shield turns from the camera to a table where another man
is strapped down
the first man raises a circular saw
the man on the table is thrashing weakly trying to move
emma still has no idea what shes looking at
suddenly the man with the saw makes a quick sweep across the table across the other mans leg at the shin
the move was so fast and casual that its taking a moment to sink in emma stands frozen clutching her cereal bowl
we see nick lean back in his chair reacting to her tone of voice
and by what sounds like a shrieking saw
on screen the man with the saw picks up the severed limb and shows it to the victim
its been lopped off below the knee
emma drops her bowl it shatters at her feet
nick and kell enter behind her confused not sure what theyre seeing
on screen the man with the saw lops off the victims forearm
oh my god
emma turns throws herself into her parents arms
they drop to their knees shielding their sobbing daughter
push in on them staring at the shrieking saw
what the hell is this
jesus christ nick
turn it off
turn it off
comforting emma its okay baby im here
nick lunges to turn off the tv as the door is swung open in a blaze of sunlight
the local cops enter with pistols drawn and shotguns leveled
faces go stark with horror as their eyes adjust
oh my lord
a record is pulled from a sleeve
an old school vinyl lp
cops easing in
angle swings queasily around as they enter widening to reveal a scene of nightmare intensity blood everywhere
and body parts
strewn and discarded
intestines nailed to the rafters overhead
a record player needle drops hits the groove with a hiss of vinyl
music starts to play loudly booming through the space
focus remains with the spinning record
an out of focus figure in a rolling chair pushes away from the record player and sails across the room toward a brightly lit work table
cops are covering their mouths with handkerchiefs gagging
the stench is incredible
flies are buzzing and swarming
one cop turns away and doubles over trying not to puke
the sergeant moves cautiously forward finds a head
on the wooden dissection table
clarence darby not that youd recognize him
his eyes are gone
his lips are missing
well most of them are scattered about
a miniature civil war soldier is held in extreme magnification before us under a tabletop magnifier the tip of a paintbrush delicately evoking stunning detail
emma is still sobbing into her mothers arms as nick takes the frame f
shouting into the phone my daughter is traumatized
shes only ten
its a goddamn snuff film
in my home
price got a video of it happening delivered to his house
dunnigan enters frame f
snatches up his extension
he listens for a few beats trying to get a word in yeah we know
nick we know
the bodys been found
the pieces anyway
call just came in
beat in some old shed on a farm outside the city
about a hundred and fifty acre piece of property
belonging to who
a giant eyeball stares at us unnaturally magnified by a tabletop magnifier
the lens is swept aside revealing benson clyde
in addition to the tabletop magnifier hes wearing magnifying lenses on his head
he examines the figurine with his naked eye then flips the glasses down to continue
vehicles race along two lane blacktop cruisers unmarked cars tactical vans
a police helicopter skims along just above them at scary low altitude
the cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road kicking up an awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide pacing
tense faces dunnigan garza nick
clyde pauses hearing a rumble under the music
glances up as the rumble passes overhead a helicopter
he clicks on a tiny fan holds the figurine under it giving it a final dry
a shitstorm descends vehicles swerving in cops jumping out machine gun toting swat tactical troops pouring from vans
clyde still holding the figurine under the whirring fan leans to one side in his chair glancing out the window
he glimpses scurrying figures behind cars cops darting and surrounding the house motioning with hand signals
he holds up the figurine for a final look
satisfied with it he places it onto a chessboard the last piece
all the others are also hand painted gorgeous
real craftsmanship here
calmly moves to the middle of the room
kicks off his shoes
peels off his shirt and undershirt
even takes off his pants
there will be no confusion about hidden weapons
he positions himself very precise and purposeful
lifts his hands high above his head
then bam doors explode in and windows shatter as the swat tactical troops storm the room bad asses in black machine guns aimed encircling him everybody shouting clyde is the
calm eye of a pissed off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers
he remains serene looking around at them hands raised high
he compliantly goes to his knees then prone offers his hands behind his back
they move in cuff him as troops spread throughout the house yelling clear
nick wearing his kevlar follows dunnigan and garza
nick glances over and sees a perfect midnight blue lincoln continental in the carport
clyde is pulled to his feet just as nick enters
uniforms spread out securing the house
dunnigan faces clyde
you have the right to remain silent
as the full miranda is read nick and clyde have their eyes locked throughout this moment is all about them
understand your rights as i have explained them
clyde is hustled outside leaving nick with dunnigan and garza in the farmhouse its renovated clean very loft like
nick drifts to the table sees the chess board cant help admiring the pieces
then his eyes go to a floor to ceiling bookcase
hes stunned to realize theyre all law books
check this shit out
nick turns moves to garzas side
dunnigan joins them
all three staring at a wall
angle shifts around to reveal the long ago photo clipped from a newspaper of nick and clarence darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps
angle widens to reveal photo after photo
the crime scene photos
photos of clyde and his family in happier times
photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial
all very neatly and precisely arrayed
the entire wall covered with them
the music keeps booming from the record player
dunnigan turns tight to camera and yells clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room
widen to reveal sarah at the observation glass
she turns as nick steps up
he says hell only talk to you
nick and dunnigan prepare to go in
dunnigan takes off his gun and holster lays them on a table as garza activates the video
cantrell finds a chair by feel sits down as nick and dunnigan enter
dunnigan melts into a corner to observe as nick sits across the table from clyde
why so formal
we go way back
call me benson
nick sits across the table from clyde settles in
maybe you can explain what this is all about
nick almost laughs not what he expected to hear
i think thats obvious
clyde spreads his hands questioningly not really
you murdered two people
rupert ames and clarence darby
shifts his gaze detective
i thought id made it clear i would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me
dunnigan glowers at him looks to nick
you murdered two people
rupert ames and clarence darby
i knew about ames of course
ive been following the news about his horribly botched execution
but darby too
quite a coincidence
cut the shit
we know you did it
save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess
are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation
beat gives in fine
far be it from me to be rude
clarence darby was found on your property
old abandoned shed
i didnt know i had one
its acres uncultivated
the other day i found a creek i never knew i had
hunters trespass all the time
you going to try to pin the dead deer on me too
i dont believe this guy
that man is frosty
it occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property
one of darbys drug rivals
thats an unsavory world
off nicks stare a jury would have to weigh that possibility
what else you got
temper flaring how about video of you dismembering darby while he was still alive
see if i were to do such a thing id probably wear something so i couldnt be identified
some kind of mask maybe
but you say its actually me on the video
did the camera capture my good side
nick snaps lunges across the table grabs clyde
you sick fuck you sent it to my house
my daughter saw that video
it fucking traumatized her
she couldnt stop sobbing
dunnigan moves in fast trying to pull nick off but failing whoa whoa nick ease off
no trouble here detective were fine
thank you though
dunnigan backs off
clyde turns back to nick whos still got him in his grasp their faces close
your daughter is what ten now
thats a wonderful age
my daughter was always so busy at that age so interested so into everything
i called her bean she jumped around so much
nick is easing off by inches subtly and ineffably weirded out unable to break clydes gaze
softly i am sorry nick that your daughter experienced that
that video should not have arrived that way
the person who sent it should have thought twice
dunnigan moves in again gently but firmly pulls nick away
unless theres hard evidence tying me to these crimes forensic or otherwise why am i here
why are we having this conversation
we know you did it
its not about what you know
its about what you can prove in court
off nicks look your words
like when you called it a justice system
you know the thing about a system nick
any system can be played
you think you can play us
you gonna take me on
clarence darby did
and im much smarter than he was
nick advances furious held back by dunnigan im gonna bury you fucker
lunges to his feet thats it thats what i want
that fire in the belly
thats what i wanted ten years ago
do it nick
shouting at clyde sit down
sit the fuck down
clyde does settles in speaking calmly or
set me free
did i stutter
make your case
shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way
off nicks look ill even make it easy on you
i will confess hows that
youre gonna confess
lets start tomorrow after a good nights sleep
well all be fresh and rested
nick paces agitated with the group ten years hes been planning this
patient people make me nervous
this freaks me out
is he serious about confessing
whats his deal is he crazy
confession or not were gonna nail him on two counts of first degree
agreed but softly
nothing hard ass no grand standing
hes a psycho with a power saw
depending on whos writing the headline hes a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child
off nicks look public sympathy is to be respected and feared
this could blow up in our faces if were not careful
we cant look like were pissed off or have an ax to grind
stops are we pissed off
do we have an ax to grind
then stop acting like it
nick takes a deep breath
he got under my skin a little
steadicam two silhouettes were following nick and sarah through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street background checks gotta be thorough i want to know everything there is to
know about this son of a bitch
get all the adas on it tell em i better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals
how about outside help
who helped us on the jacovitz case
yeah he was good
and hansons always reliable
but try to limit their hours okay
we find a mercedes at the curb kell at the wheel emma in back
nick gets in
sarah leans down happy to see them
emmas face lights up the little girl obviously adores her
well hello there beauty
hey emma hows my dynamo
we havent seen you in so long its ridiculous
when are you gonna come by for a visit
who needs a life right
talk to your husband maybe hell give us a day off one of these years
seriously we miss you
sarah blows emma a big extravagant kiss
emma returns it waves as they pull away
nick and kell glance back happy to see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self
nick in t shirt and pajama bottoms comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand rubbing his eyes
he comes to his daughters bedroom door quietly turns the knob
and finds the bed empty
sheets thrown back
nick stands for a moment every irrational fear hes ever had washing over him
camera follows him fast down the hallway
into the master bedroom where he finds emma sleeping with kell
he stands for a moment heart hammering
kell stirs sees him puts a finger to her lips
in whispers i saw her bed empty
scared the shit out of me
dont know why
she had a bad dream
she wanted to sleep with us tonight
feels his heart race jesus
he climbs onto the bed cuddles up emma between them
i had a nightmare
were all good
nobodys gonna hurt you
especially not that man
daddys gonna put him in jail forever
thats what daddy does
he makes sure the bad people stay locked away
nick lays there listening
a huge domed chamber
in the center of the floor stands a smaller free standing domed cage like a bizarre birdcage
inside the birdcage nick and garza wait
garza mans a camera
outside the birdcage observers
some cantrell and sarah occupy floor level where the video monitors are
others iger and dunnigan are on a catwalk above that encircles the room
a door opens and clyde is brought into the birdcage
he gazes around checking his surroundings
i admit i expected something more modern
that jail downtown
filled to capacity
it has been for years
they had to re open this for the overflow
part of it anyway
welcome to the county jail annex
all new inmates come here
it was in the papers
its a problem
nick joins him pulls out a legal pad
for the record youve waived legal counsel
youve offered to confess to the murders of clarence darby and rupert ames
well get to that
first what id really like to talk about is the cot in my cell
off nicks stare hardly any padding
i know what lumpy means
sorry to hear it
but were not here to talk about prison conditions were here to talk about things youve done
start with things i havent done
like get any sleep last night
beat leans forward i said lets begin today fresh and rested
you recall my words
what do you want from me
a bed in my cell
in your cell
one of those sleep matic adjustables
those are best
you want the variable temperature control too
that would be nice
nick tosses his legal pad on the table swivels around in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk spreads his arms in a help me gesture
its a steel cot
its bolted to the wall
im sure they have a wrench
we also have rules prohibiting personal items such as beds
looks to nick let me get this straight
youre going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place
you looking to deal
all right hows this
how about i dont kick your fucking teeth down your throat
clyde is mildly taken aback
the cops tense up
okay kid gloves
to clyde my daughter slept in our bed last night
she hasnt done that since she was six
you gave her nightmares
so excuse me if i dont feel like cutting any little deals today
my daughter cant have nightmares because she died with clarence darbys breath in her face
you gave him a reduced sentence and his freedom
all i want is a good nights sleep
everybodys wound up talking fast this is bullshit
hes jerking our chain big time
i can justify the expense
its not just a bed
every inmate here will be on the phone to their lawyer filing lawsuits for equal treatment
can you justify that
offering we give him a bed he confesses we take the bed away
at most its one night
cantrell weighs it decides were talking a high profile double homicide
order the bed
clyde watches as maintenance men remove the unbolted cot from the cell and his sleep matic is rolled in
convicts watch dumbfounded
clydes cellmate a towering aryan brother named dwight dixon stands quietly amazed
pre lap switching the drugs was easy
back in the birdcage i hacked the fedex database diverted the package to me made the switch sent the package on
its automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily
nobodys questioning who receives what or why
and the prison phones
get a phone company uniform hack the prison database schedule an official visit
theyll wave you through the gate like they did me
its simple if you know how things work
off nicks look its a system
you learn how it works
you play it
beat i saw him die
that stuff burned his veins
he suffered terribly
nick flips to a new page on his pad
lets move on to clarence darby
sits back hey you like music
hesitates very much
i could tell
i love music
all of it
its like air in my lungs
so the thing about clarence darby is i want my record collection and player brought to me
the vinyl discs as well as cds
reactions all around the room
iger leans forward vinyl records and cds can be broken into shards
they make excellent weapons
my answer to that one mr
clyde is not no but hell no
clyde absorbs that looks to nick as its a legitimate concern
beat calls to iger how about my ipod and speaker dock
an ipod and speaker dock now occupy a small plywood shelf attached to the railing outside clydes cell
a guard plugs it in via a long orange extension cord
angle widens to iger who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to clyde
dixons watching balefully as is every inmate on the cellblock
the player stays out here
you hand the remote to the on duty guard every night at lights out
those terms arent negotiable
i appreciate your compromise
iger draws close to the bars
quietly you looking to get your ass kicked
off clydes look by every inmate on this cellblock
you keep this up theyll take it out on you
clyde glances back to dwight
dwights watching glowering agreement in his silence
clyde turns back to iger
just trying to keep you alive in here
iger walks away
clyde aims the remote
music starts playing
he leans his head on the bars listening blissed
cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him
pre lap i took his fingers with a bolt cutter
his toes with a pair of tin snips
his balls with a hacksaw
his penis with a box cutter
his skin with a filet knife
his teeth with pliers
for those i used my fingers
looks to nick check the video i made
all that will match up
i kept him alive for an hour give or take
nick trades looks with the others in the room everybody have what they need
nicks closes his pad
my office types it up you sign
nick rises putting things in his briefcase
people get ready to leave but clyde motions garza to keep it rolling
how about a signing bonus
the small concessions youve made so far have kept my cooperation flowing
why not give me a reward for signing
you dont want to sign dont sign
weve got you on videotape well go to trial
in ten years when your appeals are exhausted ill attend your execution
ill make sure nobody tampers with the drugs
dont be such a hard ass nick
i dont want much
just a good meal
directed at iger the food here
dunnigan glances at nick and stifles a smile enjoying where this is going in spite of himself what do you have in mind
theres a place in town on halston
its a little above my pay grade
you know it dont you nick
ive eaten there
tonight at p
i would like my meal delivered to my cell from la traviata
with nice silverware crisp linens
not gonna happen
because i have no interest in making it happen
and you have nothing left to bargain with
weve just started bargaining
you havent even heard what im offering yet
this makes people pause
something in the tone of his voice
is your laptop still on
would you please do a search
she flips the laptop opens dread mounting even though shes not sure why poises her fingers over the keys
cantrells quietly stunned as the name sinks in
pin drop silence now
laptop keys clacking softly
whos william reynolds
clarence darbys defense attorney
he brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago
hes been missing now since
sarah spins the laptop a photo of reynolds a story of his disappearance
detectives dunnigan and garza will like this offer nick
itll clear one of their departments missing persons files
and itll solve them their third homicide this week
how do you think i located clarence darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name
reynolds told me though it took some convincing
push in on clyde in the frozen silence
you want the location of the body
i get my meal delivered to my cell from la traviata
a helicopter throttles up everything moving fast an fbi field team led by agent sam davies emerges from a staircase door onto the roof where they are met by nick
davies dons his kevlar vest on the move toward the waiting copter everybody shouting over the rotors to another fed to dunnigan they get to the helicopter feds loading in
as nick pulls a business card hands it to davies
davies gets in signals the pilot
the copter takes to the air buffeting nick and dunnigan
tight on clyde
he looks up speaking slowly and clearly gps position is as follows
fbi helicopter thundering over the city
delta niner foxtrot
gps coordinates follow
the helicopter veers banks into a steep turn
nick enters moves through the bullpen
adas assistant district attorneys are working and grimly focused
nick pokes his head into sarahs office
she looks up
what do we have so far
a high end delivery van bearing the logo of la traviata is waved through the gate into the delivery entrance
hes got no next of kin
no family since his wife and daughter were killed
the fbi helicopter thunders over beautiful green hills
hes a tinkerer
little inventions and gizmos
nick gazing out the window cantrell seated with his dog sarah reading the report thus far he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the
last ten years
hes invested a lot of it in real estate
properties with no real value
around airports chemical plants
stuff nobody wants
a convict comes to his bars peering out
because here comes the rolling la traviata cart gleaming domes keeping food warm silver utensils crisp linens a rose in a bud vase
a red jacketed la traviata waiter is pushing the cart accompanied by guards and warden iger
more cons appear at their bars faces peering an angry grumble growing in the cellblock as the cart goes by
the waiters looking around nervous
he gives money to charity mostly victims funds
but he also gives a big chunk to macular research
looks up he donates to eye research
thats the charity you work with isnt it
the waiter hemmed by guards nervously reads the order consomme
new york strip rare
a variety of pates
rack of lamb
oh yes rack of lamb
the helicopter roars in lands
davies and his men jump out
an fbi ground team is waiting for them
a camden field agent runs up and points at the ground shouting davies signals his team
shovels and picks hit the ground
while gorgeous food hits paper plates
its being slopped unceremoniously from the fine china by the guards
tilt up to iger overseeing this process passing china and utensils to the waiter whos flustered youre bruising the crepes
lifes a bitch then you die
no plates they break into nice jagged pieces
nothing sharp nothing that can be made sharp
no forks no knives no spoons
lose that carafe
we will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening thank you
you can eat with your fingers
the guards will think me gauche
clydes got the rose teasing his nose with it
all around the cellblock inmates are shouting insults and threats
sarah is exiting leaving nick and cantrell to stare at the phone and wait for it to ring
calls after her thanks
sod coming off being set aside on plastic
flash photos being taken
stones being pried up
waiter and guards exit with the cart
the entire cellblock is shouting
iger pauses gives a final glance back
then he too departs as aims his remote
music for dining
clyde glances back at dwight whos poised and tense
i suppose if i dont share youll beat the shit out of me
make me squeal like a piggy
that sort of thing
clyde motions join me wont you
they each take a seat
clyde passes dwight a crisply folded linen napkin
dwight tucks it like a bib
clyde lays his on his lap
a hurled object clangs off their bars
the cons are now throwing things hollering to raise the dead
clyde cranks the music a bit louder motions for dwight to dig in
dwight goes for it cramming food in his mouth and grabbing for more fingers digging in
fingers digging in pulling loose soil prying stones
a layer of soil is brushed aside to reveal a face
embedded in the dirt
hes been there a long time
flash photos highlight desiccated lips and teeth
lips and teeth dwight chewing laughing
oddly enough he and clyde seem to have started enjoying each others company
the music plays in bizarre counterpoint to the cacophony of an angry cellblock if the cons werent in their cells this would be a riot
all imaginable items are being hurled through bars toilet paper rolls books shoes clothes all raining down showering the cellblock floor
i wonder what the little people are eating tonight
dwight throws his head back and laughs
while in deep silence nick unwraps a sorry looking deli sandwich swaps his pickles for cantrells potato salad their long standing ritual
they both keep glancing at the phone
as clyde and dwight indulge their food orgy
dialogue is not important so we wont hear any well let the music take over and carry because its all about tone theyre laughing and talking winding each other up
and the more clyde wisecracks the more dwight laughs
clyde finishes gnawing a lamb rack and says something to dwight about the ruckus
dwight turns glances out as clyde casually but with purpose lowers the bone onto his lap adding it to one already there
he picks up a fresh one starts chewing the meat off
dark enough now for flashlights
in the beams we see the body mostly excavated
forensic team members gather in gloves and breather masks getting ready to try lifting
okay lets see if we can get him out in one piece
angle finds davies at the helicopter activity around him holding nicks card and dialing a cell phone
clyde laughing chewing gnawing that third bone
angle closes down as he brings it to his lap
tight reveal his napkin wrapped tightly around his hand provides padding for his palm
the two earlier bones are already held between his fingers he places the third makes a fist and the bones now protrude from his clenched knuckles like a trio of
tilt up to clyde
he reaches across turns a paper plate over to cover the crepes
the phone rings
nick snatches it up
he listens looks to cantrell
they found the body
behind davies b
the bodys being extracted from the hole gently on three
on cell well have to wait for the autopsy results but wham the grave erupts as half a dozen buried claymore mines pop like firecrackers knocking davies forward
and clyde lunges face no longer laughing the rolling cart slamming into the wall as the lamb bones protruding from his fist go slamming into dwights throat
and the dust cloud cascades across the hillside
and clyde has dwight pinned on the floor against the bars arm ramming like a piston punching those bones into dwights throat again and again blood everywhere
tight on nick holding the phone
he knows something awful just happened on the other end agent davies
an open cell phone lies on the grass
feet stumble haltingly into the shot
tilt up to davies dazed staring offscreen in shock
dust and smoke billowing
people running shouting
clyde rises into the shot calm now covered with blood
he unwraps the napkin from his hand snaps it open uses it to wipe the blood from his face
he takes his seat positions the cart uncovers the crepes and resumes eating
a steel gate slides open revealing nick
flanking him are cantrell dunnigan davies banged up and bandaged iger others
they move toward us with purpose grim and resolute sarah bringing up the rear with a young ada named royce
why do you have him in the dome
he killed his cellmate
we had to separate him out
whats wrong with solitary
we dont have the authority
not without a court order
this place was re opened under protest as it is
some areas are off limits to our use tied up in a legal challenge by the aclu as cruel and unusual
off nicks look it was nicknamed the dungeon
to sarah get judge burch on the phone
sarah speed dials as a guard lets them in
clyde waits in the birdcage shackled
the group spreads into the room silence thick
nobody will enter the birdcage this time
clyde occupies it alone owning it in fact as nice trick with the rack of lamb
didnt see that one coming
whyd you kill your cellmate
i claim self defense
heres what i think
you suckered us in
you ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him
which makes it premeditated
and again youll have to prove that in court
as ive said before
to nick make your case
or set me free
pissed moving forward your booby trap killed two of mine and put four in the hospital
that brings the total of people youve killed to six and be advised the bureau does not suffer losing agents in the field
turns were done dancing
i have the right to claim jurisdiction here do i not detective dunnigan
that is correct agent davies
again to clyde so
im gonna rendition your ass
rumor has it we have places that make guantanamo look like disneyland
dont bother packing youre gonna disappear
beat glances to nick you see nick
that man is pissed
thats what im talking about
no deals no compromise
i see you totally disconnected from reality thats what i see
handing off phone judge burch with an answer for you
im the aclus biggest fundraiser in this state
you wanna put that piece of shit in solitary
as far as im concerned you can bury him in the bowels of hell
thank you judge burch
hangs up looks to iger consider your court order signed
moves to clyde freedom
in fact you just bought a one room suite in the dungeon
youll have it all to yourself the first man down there in over twenty years
quite an achievement
clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat rests his head wearily on the bars
nick moves in speaking quietly youre doing everything wrong
making all the wrong moves
it would seem that way
the wording catches nick but he dismisses it turns sam
i know you got hit hard
i know youre furious
but id like my shot at prosecuting this case
off davies look this started with us
let me finish it
give me that chance
im seeing fire in your belly nick
i like it
this is our deal after all
lets not mistake this
this is not about the two of you
shouts wake up blind man
its been exactly that since i watched him shake clarence darbys hand on the steps of the hall of justice ten years ago
the hall of justice
his voice echoes off
in the silence that follows you wanna take this fuck down
be my guest
whatever you need
bangs his bars thats the spirit yes
to nick its on you now nick
its your game to lose
just dont screw up
you do theyll scapegoat you
thats how the justice system works
to davies good call sam
making me disappear was a bad idea
you couldnt have handled the blowback
cause and effect
your actions provoke reactions
the choices you make come back to haunt you
off their looks there are things ive set in motion
dominoes that will fall
didnt see the rack of lamb coming
start a list
all i can do at this point
if i feel like it
is stop them from happening
ready to talk deal
see how insane you think this is
youre going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within twenty four hours
or i start killing everybody
the dungeon a small underground block of five cells dating back a century or more
a guard is spraying wd into the lock of a cell trying to turn the key
it finally does as clyde is brought in
guards have him on poles connected to a leather collar around his neck and theyre none too gentle
clyde tosses a final glance back at nick and iger
clocks running nick
and then hes gone shoved inside
nick and the others exit the dome thoughts racing what can he do
weve got him boxed in
hes isolated for gods sake
lets keep him that way
strict rules apply
law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day thats what he gets
just one under heavy guard
the other twenty three hours hes in that cell hes a ghost he doesnt exist
no contact whatsoever
you think it was a bluff
we underestimated him before
id like to know what this prick is capable of
calls to sarah update on the background check
properties investments a few small businesses he owns a lot of its hidden behind false names and shell companies but were still digging
nothing else unusual
the last twenty years hes been joe blow citizen
but prior to that weve hit a blank spot
he used to do consulting for the government but we cant pin down what
they absorb this especially davies
all eyes go to him
what kind of government work leaves a blank spot sam
ill make a few discreet calls
see what i can find out
we find nick and kell at a table
shes got her menu but her attentions really on nick
hes toying absently with his wine glass
where are you
catches himself million miles away
this guys really doing a number on your head isnt he
i guess he is
she expects more its
killing his cellmate
i need that to make sense
happens in prison all the time
yeah i know but
were not talking some gang banger
this man is precise
does things for a reason
you said so yourself
we saw it on that video
psychos dont need a reason nick
theyre just psycho
off his look whatever
youll figure it out
you always do
im a poor excuse though
its date night
you deserve better
a glance around just wish youd picked another restaurant
this is our place
you love it here
as a waiter approaches you should have said something
she raises her menu yes were in la traviata
and the waiter is the same guy who brought benson clyde his meal have we decided
nicks cell phone rings
he pulls it checks the number gives them a look sorry gotta take this
what is it
beat not far maybe six blocks
im having dinner with my wife
two words doggy bag
be in your office in ten minutes
beat nick dont ask questions
i was on the phone all day
believe me when i say weve got one shot at this
he clicks off
and faces nick and cantrell in the dimly lit office hes coming here
so im told
its called inter agency cooperation but dont ask me what agency because i wouldnt know
this isnt even back channels this is theseus in the fucking labyrinth
off their looks i just blew thirty years worth of favors today calling in this one chit
i hope its worth it
the desk phone rings
nick answers listens a beat yes
yes were all here
hangs up he said not to take the elevator
off their puzzled looks
huge descending seven floors circles within circles dropping into darkness
nick and davies lead the way down
cantrell brings up the rear with his dog and cane
thats good there
nick and davies peer down
they start to make out a figure in the murky darkness one level below
which one of you is davies
davies takes a step forward
the spook eases partially into the light flinty gaze military style haircut
you must be well thought of agent davies
i dont do this
but i was asked nicely by the right people
they briefed me on your problems with benson clyde
what are we dealing with
things i can neither confirm nor deny
things of which if im asked i will disavow any knowledge
the guys trade a look
cantrell cant help chuckling
to davies you gotta be kidding me with this guy
tell me you grasp the implication of what ive said or were done here
smile fades yeah
i get it
what was clyde
some kind of spy
spooks like me are a dime a dozen
clyde was a brain
he ran a think tank inventing things for use in the field
ways to kill people
off their looks you need to get rid of somebody
its not a situation where you can get close
what do you do
and hed figure something out
he was good at it
beat you play chess
tournament level in college matter of fact
in my line we use an aptitude profile based on chess
a tournament level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player did you know that
me i think about ten steps ahead so id take you in a game
what about clyde
off the charts
if youre eight steps ahead hes twenty
hes already got the game won on the first move you dont even know youre playing yet
further into the light this cellmate he killed
you think that was random
that was a pawn taken off the board
if i were you id be trying to figure out what the move was
i have been
top of my head
was the cellmate ever connected with this case
or with clyde
was anybody else in that facility
any connection at all no matter how remote
because if clyde says he has things in play he does
hes locked up
what can he do
gives him a look youre an average chess player arent you
actually i kind of suck
i can tell
but i like your tie
perplexed thank you
theres this tie we call it the albert after albert desalvo
they tiptoe in one night thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties
sounds crazy but trust me it works
you put your tie on and all day long it slowly tightens
you dont even notice its cutting off the blood flow to your brain
then you drop dead
brain dead or plain dead doesnt much matter at that point
beat clyde invented that
the spook melts back into the shadows
the guys crane forward trying to see
theres a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes
the three of them stand there absorbing everything theyve heard
nick sits on a step
quiet looks are traded
and they all start taking off their ties
nick enters tie less subdued distracted
kell and emma are in the living room playing scrabble
emma jumps up and runs over for a hug
mom said i could stay up late
wanna play scrabble
let me talk to mom first
emma returns to the couch
kell comes to nick noticing his weird vibe hes looking around at the room
sorry about date night
you learn anything
thing or two
he moves up the hallway slowly as if noticing the walls for the first time the picture frames the light fixtures
following him nick
hey i was thinking
maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and emma in case you need to
spend the night in a hotel
why would we wanna do that
its like a fire drill thing
he comes in opens the closet reaches up for some overnight bags but pauses drawn to his tie rack inside the door
he stares at the ties hanging in neat rows
starts touching them running his hands up and down the fabric
kell stands in the doorway watching
wondering what the fuck is going on
and getting a little creeped out
he freezes feeling something in the seam of a tie
runs his fingers up and down thinking somethings in there
emma appears in the doorway too at her mothers side
both staring now
they watch as nick grabs a pair of scissors from kells sewing kit carves the tie lengthwise rips it open feverish and faster finds nothing inside but mangled fabric and
thread and stops
realizes theyre staring at him
what the hell are you doing
nick pauses what the hell is he doing
he starts to regain his sense laughs at himself in amazement
its okay baby im fine i promise
go back to your game
dubious emma departs
as soon as shes out of earshot seriously nick
what the fuck
i got paranoid for no reason thats all
im fine now
i cant believe i let that son of a bitch clyde get to me like that
are you in danger
the question hangs there the real question
im sure were fine
he pulls his phone speed dials
ill make goddamn sure
beat into phone sarah roust the adas
tell em were pulling an all nighter
adas are parking their cars along the wall directed by a waving guard
angle finds a lot of people cop prison fbi
sarah jumps out of her car and hurries over to nick and the others with a flock of eight adas at her heels
ready to turn this place upside down
we find the ada team spread around the bullpen aided by prison personnel and police advisors everybodys on computers or sorting heaps of paper files etc
see if theres anybody locked up here or working here ex cop witness for the prosecution anybody who might have had anything to do with the original darby ames case
or has any previous history with benson clyde
start with the cellmate
flag anything no matter how insignificant it seems
jameson glances up in dismay from his keyboard
this could take days
sarah grabbing a stack from a filing cabinet and slamming the door shut with her hip gives him a laser look we boring you jameson
you got someplace to be
no miss lowell
crossing the room weekend plans
i dont wanna hear any shit about it
on jameson again clack clack jameson
jameson dives onto the keys starts clack clacking
sarah gives nick a nod shes got this in hand
and finds a forensic team disassembling clydes sleep matic bed nuts bolts struts electronics
the mattress is being razored open wadding pulled out and run under fluoroscopes
it used to be a sleep matic adjustable bed
now its not
camera follows them to a table where an fbi team is focusing all their skills and tech on clydes ipod and speaker dock
the team leader places the buds in his ears listening
what do you have
rocky mountain way
off nicks look what do you want from me its a fucking ipod
the other agents snicker not hiding their amusement but tear it apart make sure
guards feds bomb sniffing dogs theyre cruising the cellblocks flashlights swiveling beams catching the faces of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars
we find nick and iger at clydes now empty cell
two fbi emerge shake their heads
sleepy at his bars warden man whassup
everybody back to sleep
looks to iger i want to see him
two doors solid steel outer door inner barred door
the outer slides aside reveals nick outside the bars
inside stands a shadow waiting clyde
youre up early
it was a good bluff
but youre done
fucking with my head
scaring my family half to death
clyde moves closer to the bars into the light
amazing isnt it
how primal that is
what a man is capable of when it comes to his family
you strip away all the polite shit thats what were really about
i hope you never face what it is to lose them nick
its like dying yourself
theres nothing worse
that could play as a threat of course but its not
and nick knows it
good night ben
good night nick
and then the moments gone and the mocking clyde returns is it casual friday
off nicks look ive never seen you not wear a tie
and that says volumes clydes totally aware of what theyve been up to and is tickled by it
the outer door grinds shut
night has passed day is coming
all the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness
people straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles
nick dunnigan davies iger all look whipped
sarah approaches briefcase in hand files under her arm
we dug pretty deep for one night
still got a ways to go but on a first look
well thats good news
now we double down
make absolutely certain
nods after adas let them all sleep a few hours then bring em back for round two
my middle name
she trudges toward her car following the adas toward their vehicles
nick trades relieved looks with the men everybody coming down from a tense night
davies shakes their hands fellas
for once glad not to be of assistance
love it when they cry wolf
the men separate in different directions
dunnigan catches a glimpse of sarah almost at her car she loses a page from under her arm which flutters away on the breeze
calls to her miss lowell
she looks back sees the page skittering slowly across the ground
weary she blows a strand of hair from her eyes sets down her briefcase walks back to get it
dunnigan smiles keeps walking
the other men too
nick stands a moment watching then starts toward his car
the adas are getting to their cars pulling key fobs aiming them to unlock their cars
sarah is getting to the page leaning down
the adas are pressing the remotes a chorus of chirps
and wham the cars explode in a stunning series of detonations killing the adas throwing bodies through the air kicking cars off the ground and flipping a few skyward
nick is knocked flat by heat and shrapnel ripping the air
sarah goes flying
an arcing car slams upside down nearby on a rocket booster of flame and shattering axle
and from this point on the visuals and sound are surreal pries himself off the ground stunned looking around trying to figure out what the fuck just happened
hes disoriented all sound muffled
dunnigan runs up to nick shouting something
we cant tell what because nick cant hear
dunnigan sees nick is alive turns and keeps going running to help the others
nick looks over sees bodies being pulled clear by responders men running in beating at flames
nick dazed looks through the drifting smoke and sees sarah trying to sit up
theres something wrong with her leg
nick pulls himself to his knees staggers to his feet as sound filters back in screams shouts the roar of flames
he stumbles through the smoke to sarah
shes on the ground in shock sobbing and flailing crying out
nick sees the jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf nearly severing it
he drops to his knees tries to calm her youre gonna be all right
he pulls the metal from her leg mistake
he clamps down hard with both hands blood going everywhere
he keeps clamping down sarah screaming and sobbing as we firemen spraying the flaming rubble of the cars
tangles of wreckage billowing smoke
a body bag dragged across the ground added to a row of body bags awaiting transport
emergency vehicles parked haphazardly lights spinning
cops and responders dealing with the scene
sarah being wheeled on a gurney to a paramedic van by an ems team oxygen mask on her face gravely injured but stabilized everything swirling around her dunnigan clearing a
nick appears takes her hand
she clasps it weakly
they load her on and the vehicle pulls out with siren and lights
back to real time cantrell is just getting out of his town car with his dog
we find nick on his cell on cell baby
dont be worried or scared
but i want you to pack those overnight bags
i dont have time to explain now
just do it okay
ill call you back as soon as i can please honey i gotta go
he clicks off as angle comes around revealing davies and his teams coming his way each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank
hes got someone working with him
on the outside
hes got to
everything looks pre rigged
we found a short range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall
when your people showed up here and drove in through the gate the signal armed the bombs
he could have planted those bombs a month ago
grappling for sense no
no weve got two dozen adas on payroll
those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment
how could he know which eight would show up
our people just found bombs on every car in your ada pool
all two dozen
were disarming those now
tight on clyde shoved into the birdcage
the neck poles are disengaged
he moves forward gazing through the bars
i want a phone in my cell
if im conducting my own defense it would be useful
also in case you and i need to be in touch nick
glances at clock your twenty four hours are about up
in return for the phone ill extend you another twelve hours
how many more people die while you stand around dithering
how many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in
cantrell closes in tracking clyde by voice motherfucker
whatever point you had was lost long ago
eight kids dead in that yard most of them just out of college
i have to talk to their families
i have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead
clyde leans down right in cantrells face intense ive been waiting for my explanation for ten years
cantrell spits in his face turns away trembling with rage
clyde calmly wipes it off rises to address them all if it hasnt dawned on you this is a war
as in any war there will be collateral damage
the question as always is how much damage youre willing to take before you withdraw
maybe i got a better idea
maybe we end this war right now
looks around fourteen people dead
i have to say this out loud
moving toward clyde prisoners die in custody all the time
attacking a guard
trying to escape
shit like that
clyde eyes locked pulls his shirt open heres your target
dunnigan temper flaring yanks his revolver and aims
dont tempt me
jesus christ man dial it back
it would be decisive
stupid but decisive
off dunnigans look can you handle the blowback detective
the shit like that
nicks stunned seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control
he steps in seizing the moment back put the gun away
are you crazy
calmly reholsters its an option
all im saying
risk the blowback
ride it out
were not risking anything
or letting him tear us down
to clyde youre not getting us to throw out the rules like you
i like rules
ive wanted you to follow them from the start
like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family
re buttons so
a phone buys you another twelve hours
but if you havent cut my deal and let me go by the deadline
ill kill someone in this room
that sucks the air out of the conversation everybody stares as that sinks in
glances are traded
he looks at the room full of people scans their faces as if trying to pick
he points his finger starts going from one end of the group to the other
from person to person to the end moving back again
he lands on cantrell
cantrell obviously cant see
whos he pointing at
everybody on the move emotions high fuck him
let him try
thats not helpful
we have fourteen dead
you could ask them what hes capable of but theyre in no position to answer
beat tight point taken
well give him his phone
well tap in and monitor every call
buys us another twelve hours we could use that right now
that puts the deadline at
checks his watch about tonight
ill be in front of a room full of lawyers
im the keynote speaker
find a replacement
until his deadline passes youre in protective custody
cantrell isnt happy about it but nods
and have them switch the location of that dinner
thats last minute
he could have gotten your schedule in advance been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else
that eenie meenie act could have been horseshit
off their looks we have to get a few moves ahead
plan for every contingency
this way mr
garza youre with mr
they split up
dunnigan leads cantrell to an unmarked car while nick and garza head toward nicks
nicks phone rings
he checks the number answers hey baby no im fine
honey calm down
he listens a beat calls to the men getting in the other cars our shit just hit the fan in a big way were all over the news
on phone yes all eight died
sarahs in surgery right now
beat they think so but
beat okay ill meet you there
he hangs up aims his key fob and hesitates
he and garza trade a look thinking the same thought
angle shifts to youre good
cars been swept
of course it has
nick feeling foolish presses the fob
nothing but a tiny chirp
he and garza get in
cantrell and his dog ride in back
both men tense and silent
two police cruisers provide escort
nick is pulling up toward the hospital sees a tv news van at the entrance a minicam crew arguing with hospital security
ill get us in back
nick hits the gas drives past the news van
and they come past the nurses duty desk
uniforms are stationed in the hallway
garza pushes a path through keep the press off this floor understand
nick squeezes past
the floor is busy
he finds kell in the waiting area
she looks up spots him
she and nick pull into a tight embrace
no words for a long moment
kells shaken fighting tears
shes in surgery now
theyre saying shell be okay
youll have to explain the good part nick
im missing it
this is crazy
what if something happened to you
what would i say to emma
what would we do
you didnt lose me
does the school know were pulling emma out of class
i called yeah but id rather be here for sarah when she wakes up
nick and for you
i want to do something
getting our daughter out of harms way
calls to garza detective
will you escort my wife please
to kell theres not much time
ill be there to see you off
kell reluctantly walks away with garza while a media frenzy is brewing trucks pulling in news crews gathering
angle to a reporter on camera reporting live from a tense scene at city hall
we have confirmation of earlier reports that eight people with the district attorneys office were killed this morning in an explosion at the county correctional annex in george hill
nick enters finds the staff around the bullpen watching the same live report
everybodys in shock a few are crying
details are sketchy at this point and names are being withheld
people start noticing nick
royce comes up looking dazed
thats the good news
oh god thats a relief
calls to the others miss lowell is okay
everybody reacts they needed a shred of good news
weve been getting calls from upstairs
the mayors people
off nicks look someone from our office has to make a statement to the press
cantrell absent the mayor wants you to do it
pause thinking royce
how much petty cash do we have in the safe
i dont know
give it to me
and your cell phone
i need to borrow it for a few days
beat puzzled what do you want me to tell the mayor
a figure enters shot pushes a door open into glaring daylight
camera follows him outside to a podium set up before a swarming mob of press shouting questions
angle comes around to reveal royce nervous leaning to the microphones
we in the d
s office are still reeling from the events of this morning as you can imagine
its a tragic day for us
for our city
kell and emma on the platform garza hovering nearby crowds swarming around them as boarding calls come over the p
kell is looking around anxious
nick appears on the platform hurrying
they see him
emma runs throws herself into nicks arms as he crouches
i wanna see sarah
shes fine dont be scared
thats not allowed
and theres no reason for it
why do we have to go
cause your mom wants to see a few broadway shows
you gonna begrudge her that
youre kinda full of shit dad
nicks taken aback not sure whether to laugh
he trades a look with kell whos too tense with worry to care
okay youre right
maybe i am a little
but only a little
the part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine
directed at kell i mean it
she detaches from her father
nick rises to kell pulls an envelope hands it to her
no credit cards
too easy to track
meals hotel whatever pay cash
then takes her cell swaps it for royces
ill keep this
it can be traced
use this one instead
dont answer unless you see its me
i love you
she embraces him fears and emotions swirling
be goddamn careful
she breaks the embrace
nick stands watching them get on the train
the doors close
the train starts out
garzas been watching a look of sympathy for what nicks going through
kell and emma on the train watching buildings slide by outside the window
kell troubled holding her daughter
we follow the train traveling a path through canyons of buildings leaving the city
angle swaps train for car as we drift over a bridge and find nicks car racing across the span
nick and garza enter
angle comes around to reveal the house swarming with high tech fbi forensic teams turning the house upside down tearing things apart x ray scanning walls
cantrell sits isolated near tears of frustration as the place is trashed around him
he glances up hearing jesus
these guys wont even let me pack a bag
not even a toothbrush
davies enters frame accompanied by forensic techs not the guys from downtown but people who work serious ops
we have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice maker
he holds up a drinking glass with a few ice cubes runs a black light wand behind it dark granules become visible on each pass embedded in the ice
im betting something lethal
like this salt
pours a small amount not sodium chloride
its a neuro blocker stops the heart they use it in lethal injections
youd be dead before you got up from the table
nick tosses the others a grim look
im telling you clyde has someone working with him
someone on the outside
who could he have
somebody from his past
could be that spook we met on the stairs for all we know hed know how to plant this shit
no why would clyde let him come talk to us
to fuck with our heads
to get us to bring in our adas so he could blow them up
it would be a clyde move
but its not proof
to cantrell could he have planted this stuff in your house before he was arrested
i i dont know
jonas think last few days have you used any ice
confused grappling i dont use salt my cholesterol
yeah not long ago
before or after he was arrested
i dont remember
you track your use of ice nick
you keep a daily log
tech calls from the kitchen heads up
looks like polonium here
in his tea pot
same way the russians killed litvenenko
took him two weeks to die
off their looks its an exotic isotope
all you need is a trace amount
rips through your organs and bone marrow
nicks been listening thunderstruck paler by the moment
he looks to cantrell sitting there quiet and shaking
ill buy you a new toothbrush
drifting in on a reflective glass skyscraper spectacular
the door opens revealing nick cantrell et al
they come into the room
actually room undersells it
its the most spectacular suite known to man huge open floor plan with a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us
im actually a little jealous clyde didnt pick me
cantrell laughs and it lightens everybodys mood
nick drifts to the windows gazing out as its the presidential suite
last person who stayed here was actually a president
of a country
security here is amazing
its not bad jonas
i think you can muddle through
youre muddling with him
i dont want you back at your house until my people sweep it
you need pajamas buy some in the shop downstairs
nick nods pulls sarahs reports from his briefcase
the background check my office was compiling these properties we think clyde owns
if he is working with somebody they could be operating out of any of these
we should check them
ill try to wrangle additional manpower
pages the report no shit
this is quite a list
over forty locations
its not even complete
sarah was in the middle of it untangling property ownership from under assumed names shell companies
shes the expert on all that
im grateful for all your efforts
i just wanted to say it
save it for tonight
hope youre in the mood for chinese takeout
where are you going
that stuff in your house its all gone too far
i started this
i owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it
a steel door opens
clyde steps out shackled blinking at daylight
he comes down a short flight of steps
camera comes around to reveal his surroundings not within prison walls but rather behind the prison a loading area we havent seen comprised of fences and razor wire
nick walks in the rear gate passed through by warden iger himself this is clearly an off the books meeting
nick and clyde walk to each other meet halfway
interesting location youve chosen
i thought wed have some privacy
gazes around maybe youve decided to take detective dunnigans advice
hes noticing guards atop the prison wall and surrounding roofs all with sniper rifles
be the perfect place for it
outside the wall
look like you were shot trying to escape
nick and clyde below
a scope suddenly rises into frame turning our shot into a sniper scope pov jumping clydes face into magnification
he smiles in the crosshairs
you have some kind of signal worked out
you scratch your nose and blam im a goner
something like that
might solve all your problems
whats stopping you
afraid of the blowback
its to prove a point
off clydes look just because i have the power doesnt mean i have to use it
one can show mercy
so why dont you
we see clydes brain bend a little trying to wrap his head around it
its almost painful for him
i think weve come a little too far for that havent we nick
i mean what do i say
sorry my bad
which way to the execution chamber
dont give me that
death doesnt scare you
smiles right yeah but
were in the flow of this now
you cry havoc you let slip the dogs of war you go with it
you dont just stop because someone says hey wait
by then the dogs are dragging you
until one side admits defeat
what if i did that
what if i said
beat you were right
i was wrong
what if i say i should have prosecuted both men ten years ago
id say youre making progress
you should have you know
id have lost
with your head held high
and without any blame from me
nicks cell rings he turns away answers yeah
beat she is
ill stop on my way back
put some get well flowers in her room they sell em in the lobby
hangs up baleful six hours in surgery
but shes okay good
miss lowell is a fine young woman
beat oh hey
your wife and little girl get out of town all right
beat staring you asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose
clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh
just a guess
its what i would do
get em out make sure theyre safe
like id ever have hurt them anyway
there are limits
even in war
i may be many things nick
but im not clarence darby
im not rupert ames
im not that kind of monster
what kind are you
not the kind whod hurt your wife and child
christ look at me
mine were my salvation then they were killed and all i had left was this
life without them in this fucking charnel house world
drawing close it hurt to lose them didnt it
even knowing theyd come back
imagine knowing they wouldnt
i cant imagine that
i envy you
for me knowing mine wont come back is the only thing thats crowded my thoughts for ten years
if i could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain i would
i wont make any more deals with murderers
if hearing that makes a difference
if that was the point of all this
we see clydes brain hurting again hes trying to believe that would like to believe that
i have no doubt as we stand here that you really believe that
i wish i could
pause are we done
you gonna scratch your nose or can i go
nothing left to say
they turn and walk in opposite directions
and clyde is brought in locked into gloom as the doors slam behind him
he stands staring at the darkness
the sun is setting
as nick drives back into town crossing one of the bridges
not cantrells hotel but one close by
a sign reads a
people are entering passing a greeter
angle finds judge burch arriving
a secretary answers the ringing phone judges chambers
laura that you
im sorry judge burch is gone for the evening
listen honey i flew in from galveston for this a
a thing laura invited me to just got here and they said it was moved
you got a number address anything
nick peers in
sarahs in bed leg braced in traction
shes awake but groggy which isnt stopping her from giving instructions to royce whos scribbling notes at her bedside tell hansen we need hard info on those addresses
dont let the shell game on ownership title slow him down
at this point well take educated guesses
sarah looks over sees nick step in gives him a weak smile
he comes to the bed takes her hand squeezes it
how you doing
this place has great drugs
i shouldve totaled my leg long ago
but her emotions are in turmoil she puts her hands over her face holding back a sob
theyre all dead
im afraid so
sarah lets herself cry
nick waits then youre alive
that counts for a lot
beat im sorry i put you in harms way
she absorbs that angrily wipes her eyes
it wasnt you
it was that son of a bitch
i hear hes threatened jonas
were all over it
jonas is safe out of reach
cantrell on the upper level wearing brand new sweats white cane tapping the unfamiliar place betsy at his side
he follows voices around the corner
inside a room garzas playing poker with three other cops laszlo fleming and mitrius
laszlo the cheatin prick
wanna sit in
if i had my braille set id clean you out
not much of a game if you have to tell me what my cards are
the other guys toss garza a look what a moron
turns away enjoy your game fellas
want one of us should walk you down
unfamiliar places take me a little longer
but i get there
calls after him holler if you need anything
back to the game okay whos in whos out
waiters setting out salads guests taking seats as good evening
sorry for any confusion our last minute change of location might have caused
that incredible city view skyscrapers all around aglow with lights
cantrell enters frame drawn to the glass
a police helicopter is roaring slowly past out there drifting among the buildings at our eye level
cantrell raises his hand places it on the glass feeling the vibrations
the copters searchlight sweeps the windows highlighting him briefly with incredible light he cant see
but we can see the copter going by from here searchlight playing over cantrells building which is plainly visible just across the way
angle widens to find judge burch at a table as please join me in a warm welcome for our keynote speaker this evening judge laura burch
she rises and heads for the podium amidst applause
nick exits arms loaded down with bags of takeout talking on his cell phone as he heads for his car yes you pain in the ass of course i got
your kung pao
you think id forget
just dont give betsy any i cant deal with dog farts all night
cantrells sitting in front of that incredible view with betsy at his feet on the phone how long man im starving
nick gets to his car checks his watch and pauses
the time reads
nick is suddenly hit with a momentary sense of dread
he glances up the street
reveals nick in deep f
looking up the broad avenue in the distance stands cantrells skyscraper
im minutes away
nick shakes off his misgivings hangs up gets in the car
cantrell eases to the floor sits with betsy
he strokes her fur
she whines uneasy
its gonna be okay
judge burch at the podium jonas was upset not to be here with you tonight
a personal matter came up
but he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards
angle looking up at cantrells hotel a figure steps into our shot his back to us
he pulls a cell phone from his pocket flips it open sees the time
the thumb starts pressing numbers boop
angle drifting across the floor cantrell and betsy against the incredible city view
he finally gets fed up with that surgery collar shes worn the entire movie reaches around unsnaps the plastic
he puts the collar aside gently ruffs her shaggy neck
he puts his arm around her taking comfort in her presence
a quiet pensive moment
nick driving a block from the hotel now
as the figure finishes dialing
the thumb hovers a moment then presses send
we hear the call ringing through
and cantrell hears a strange sound
almost like a phone ringing sort of close but not weirdly muffled
he looks around trying to pinpoint it
his head finally swivels down to betsy lying at his side
shes whining getting a little freaked licking her stitches
cantrells hand travels down her fur to her belly
fingertips tracing the stitching
and what he cant see is the strange glow building under her skin
but he can sense it
his eyes widen slightly
the room is swallowed in a detonation which blows out the room in a huge explosion the rows of windows vanishing in a storm of flame and shattering glass
judge burch and the others gasp as the explosion lights up the night from the building across the way
nick slams on his brakes he cranes forward gazing up in horror as the explosion is reflected in his windshield
the blast kicks from the face of the building fireball rising with eerie grace into the night sky as the figure steps into frame pockets the cell phone
camera pivots behind him losing cantrells building and bringing the other hotel into view the one with the lawyers
nick jumps out stunned
he runs up the street toward the hotel as glass and debris rains onto the sidewalk
people crowd to the glass staring out at the skyscraper across the way at the smoking ruin that was once a floor
and the figure bends down picks something up
he hefts it onto his shoulder a laws rocket launcher
he flips up the sight takes aim at the other hotel fires
whooosh the rocket streaks leaving a contrail
fast cut judge burch and those around her reacting as the glare of the rocket approaches in a heartbeat wham
our second explosion of the night takes out the ballroom killing dozens blowing flame and debris across the room
nick sees it the contrail the second blast all of it
it stops him dead in his tracks
garza and his guys come stumbling and bleeding from the room they were in
they get to the top of the stairs find the front of the suite open to the windy sky outside
gasping on radio we need help up here
what the fuck hit us
nick stares up wondering the same thing as we a foot high hand painted domed ceiling above an equally huge round table below an imposing room that says power
nick is ushered in
a dozen or more people are seated top echelon city brass political fire police
also present are davies and dunnigan
dunnigan is not seated hes getting his ass reamed today
the top dog the mayor
hes seething but not a screamer a man who keeps it tightly reined were worldwide news this morning
almost twenty dead among them some of this countrys top attorneys
i had friends in that room
hell i almost attended myself
the second explosion
i saw a rocket fired
to davies and dunnigan clyde does have somebody on the outside
what you saw or think you saw is beside the point
what matters is that the fbi wanted to rendition this man out of my city
the reason hes still here causing havoc is you
you wanted to prosecute this case
your ambition kept him here and provoked this tragedy
mutters not entirely fair
your job is hanging by a thread
id think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered
dunnigan formidable though he is looks away keeps his mouth shut
the mayor approaches nick looks him in the eye
when i go in front of the cameras today unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked im going to make goddamn sure the media doesnt hang
this abject disaster around my neck
because im hanging it on yours
beat youre done
get the fuck out
people going about their business
nick exits dazed comes down the steps
he sits on a step vacant a man completely at a loss and out of options
his cell rings
he rouses himself flips it open
some legal team from the mayor showed up here this morning
i hear youre off the case
told you theyd scapegoat you didnt i
howd you kill jonas
i know about the second explosion i saw the contrail so i know you got somebody working for you
but the first explosion how
say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem
hungry ex wives
heavy gambling debts
a bizarre sound occurs on the line an unidentifiable shrieking sound that grows and rapidly dissipates
say that guys a veterinarian
you hand him a million in cash hell do what you ask
especially if hes looking to blow town for good
cant believe it it was
inside the dog
you own the vet you own the dog
explosive wasnt even that big
stuff i use it didnt have to be
beat hidden in plain sight
thats my specialty
havent you figured that out yet
nick sighs rubs his eyes can barely even speak
whats next for you
mulling career options
i suppose law is out
im trying to get over my friend being dead
aside from that fuck you
beat ill miss you nick
it was a good dance
didnt bring your family back though did it
off clydes silence has it made you feel better
you done making your point
just warming up
this is clausewitz shit my friend
camera pushing in on nick listening as im gonna pull the whole thing down
i will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased corrupt temple down on my head
beat stay tuned
itll be biblical
click line goes dead
nick sits staring at the phone
nick enters finds sarah crying
a wall mounted tv is playing a news report of the explosions file footage of jonas cantrell pops up
nick drifts over sits at her bedside as going live now to city hall where mayor tilden is about to make a statement
announcing were told among other things the dismissal of district attorney nick price
the image cuts to the mayor stepping to the mic
thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion
nick mutes it
he and sarah dont speak for long moments hes waiting for her to pull herself together
she finally does going into professional mode pulling her laptop and files and reports around her
we got the latest batch of background in
hansen and the other guy did some good work here sarah
give it a rest
off her look im done
the mayor is nailing my coffin shut
the best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can see what you can salvage of your career
sarah is staring at him with fuck you in her eyes
she picks up a multi page list of addresses hands it to him
this lists over fifty shit value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own stuff around chemical plants factories
all are owned by benson clyde
look at twenty two
nick not caring scans down to joes lube and drive garage
went out of business in
looks up irritated now why would joes extinct lube and shit garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you me or anyone
tight pissed the garage not so much
but the address
look at the location
nick looks down at the list again
a shitty garage in a shitty industrial park
bordering it on the other side of some fencing are municipal train tracks
nicks car pulls up
he gets out
its a ghost town here
he goes to the garage window glass thick with dirt
he wipes with his sleeve but it doesnt help him see in
tight on roll up door a car jack jams in under the lip
we hear cranking and the door rises
nick drops down peering in
he squeezes under the door stands up
gloomy in here
he hits the door switch it rattles up on its tracks flooding the place with light
he looks around
a car under a tarp on the hydraulic floor lift
old shelves and pallets of tools
the crap of ages
he sighs turns and walks out
something tickling his brain
suddenly a shrieking commuter train blasts by gone dwindling
it was a bizarre distinctive sound
like the one nick heard during his last phone call with clyde
nick stands frozen pieces in his head tumbling and threatening to fall into place
something about the shape of that car under that tarp
he turns staring at it
goes back in drawn to it its long distinctly old school with sharp boxy corners
he draws the tarp off finds a lincoln continental midnight blue in excellent condition
the last time he saw it it was parked in a carport at benson clydes farmhouse
whats it doing here
more pieces falling into place
nick leaves the garage again walking out
camera tracks him across the tarmac and as we come around the corner of the building we reveal the county correctional annex is right there a backwater corner of the
prison not sixty feet away
nick stares up at it a very curious location indeed
fast cuts nick searching
the grimy little office
looks at the car
theres a mechanics pit below that hydraulic lift
he goes to the control hits up
nicks face comes slowly into view as the hoist rises
in blackness we hear boop boop boop
a cell being dialed
the line ringing
a voice answering weary dunnigan
on cell do we finish this tonight
nervous glance around look
no hard feelings but there is no we
i cant even be seen talking to you
i know who hes got on the outside
that stops dunnigan ill ask again
do we finish this tonight
poor dunnigan looks tortured
he catches garzas eye
a train shrieks through shot revealing the garage quiet in moonlight
the area deserted
the garage door rolls up on its tracks
a pair of headlights kick on blinding us
the lincoln emerges moves off into the night as the door rolls down again
we hear soft static from a police radio and a voice all units
subject vehicle is on the move
angle widens to reveal were in an unmarked car dunnigan at the wheel nick beside him
dunnigans on the radio everybody maintain distance
dunnigan puts the car in gear pulls out
drifting magically through the downtown skyscrapers
neon lit rooftops
city lights reflecting off glass buildings
an fbi helicopter drops into shot
camera comes around pacing the copters reflection in the buildings were passing
skyscrapers pass the lens below us
theres a midnight blue lincoln traveling the streets far below
it turns a corner moving up a long boulevard
camera pivots around a skyscraper following
the lincoln cruising cold reflections of street lamps kicking off sheet metal flowing along its body and windshield
we start zooming and racking focus to the unmarked cars tailing it in traffic
visually it becomes a surreal dance of headlights and traffic signals
a police copter joins the fbi copter in the air
both cruising eerily against a kaleidoscopic wash of city lights
maintain two thousand foot ceiling
subject vehicle turning south off of hudson
into an alley
clicks hand mic hang back
the lincoln pulls to a loading door
the door rises
and the lincoln enters
it stops next to a large cube van with the logo nomos custodial services
camera pushes in as the car door opens feet step out
tilt up to clyde dressed in a custodial services uniform
he slams the car door gets in the van fires up the engine
far below us the van emerges from the same door comes out of the alley and back onto the street
i got a white van
large cube type
think he switched vehicles
moving north again on hudson
five and six stick with that building in case hes trying to cowboy us
all other units stay with the van
dunnigan pulls out into traffic resuming the tail
i have visual on van
logo on side reads nomos custodial services
where the hell is he going
the glorious old building looms above us
tilt down to reveal a red carpet event brewing limos and luxury cars pulling up guests in expensive attire getting out
the nomos van steals the frame as it drives past and turns to go around the back of the building
a limo steals the frame back as it pulls to the curb
the mayor steps out waving and smiling for flashing cameras
nick and dunnigan drive past all the hoopla
you dont suppose nomos custodial has a service contract with city hall do you
off dunnigans look of oh shit
tight on a card scanner as a card is swiped
thunk the lock disengages
tilt up to clyde as he rolls a loaded custodial cart with mops and trash barrel inside
a guard mans the security desk he glances up from a bank of live feed video monitors as clyde rolls his cart in
aint seen you around
had to get that vacation in
visited my sister in the keys
good for you
hey whats all that hoopla at the main entrance
mayors got a big fuckin thing
thousand dollar a plate whatever
they say the governor might come
moving on ill stay out of their way
calls after him theyre up on six avoid that floor
they got more security than god
far below the entrance lit up with arriving cars and guests a helicopter drifts through the shot just below us in slow motion rotors thrumming eerily
while clyde rides up
he stops at five gets out
and rolls his cart up the hallway
muffled music from the floor above
he comes to a door sorts his keys
and enters in darkness
moving swiftly he reaches into his trash barrel pulls a gleaming steel briefcase from under the shredded papers he strides to the judges dais lays the case atop it turns
and heads back to his cart
as a stream of tactical cops stampede into the building and up the stairs
angle finds nick dunnigan and davies looming over the nervous security guard what floor
i told him to avoid six
checking monitors there
on a monitor clyde rolls his cart from the courtroom
thats the main courtroom on five
thats right below the ballroom
the mayors event
early arrivals are coming up entering the ballroom
the place is crawling with secret service types in suits
clyde comes down the hallway b
rolling his cart
angle finds tactical cops with machine guns pouring quietly up the stairs taking up positions just around the corners poised and tense
tighten in as the tac leader uses a small mirror to peek around the corner and spot clyde whispering on headset subject in sight
do we take him
nick dunnigan and others are racing up the steps
dunnigan raises his radio to say yes but no
let him go
off dunnigans look we know where to find him
lets get to that courtroom
dunnigan hesitates against every instinct in his body
i hope you know what the fuck youre doing
clicks mic negative
were letting him go
all units hang back
we are letting the subject go
the cops trade surprised glances
the elevator dings
clyde gets on the doors close
the cops swarm up the hallway
this all happens fast bang the doors slam open
nick leads a huge phalanx of cops and fbi in weapons and flashlight beams stabbing in all directions
they race to the judges dais the steel case
dont touch it
could be motion sensitive
davies shoves his way to the front grabs a small hand held drill from one of his guys tactical vests i need light
dozens of beams converge
davies places the drill goes to work on the case
i have visual
suspect leaving the building
different service exit
clyde exits a loading dock gets in his van
the drill taps through
davies yanks it feeds a fiber optic tube into the hole puts his eye to the eyepiece
he swivels the tube carefully peering inside
glances up explosives
davies takes his eye from the eyepiece looks at them
c is for girl scouts
this is malglinite
take out the whole floor above us
maybe this entire corner of the building
can you open it
back to eyepiece no we got tripwires
we open this lid instant karmas gonna get us
keeps scanning dont see a motion sensor
trigger looks simple
dial a cell phone incoming call arms the trigger triggers set to count down from forty seconds then boom
off their looks that call comes in we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible
to his men alert the mayors security team
evacuate those people upstairs clear that ballroom go
dunnigan turns on him instant shouting match no
what the fuck are you talking about this could go off any second
he wont set it off until that room is full
people are still arriving red carpet shit thats at least another half hour
i will not take that risk
you have to
nick no longer shouting but intense and fast if im him ive rigged cameras in that ballroom live video feed first sign of an evacuation i trigger the bomb
off their looks we have to think ahead of this fuck
whats the move
clyde slams the van door gets in the lincoln
he pulls a handheld clamshell video monitor it shows a live feed of people entering the ballroom mingling as they arrive
clyde smiles starts the engine
the mayor enters waving to everybody shaking hands
the garage door rises
the lincoln backs in stops on the hydraulic lift
clyde gets out throws the tarp over it
briefly checks his clamshell
still plenty of time
he raises the lift a few feet drops down and crawls under the car into duplicate controls
he hits the button and the car sinks down atop us settling to the floor sealing us into darkness
a bright light turns on one of those gazillion candlepower flashlights
clyde aims it and we see a tunnel hewn into the wall of the mechanics pit
just large enough for clyde to crawl into
hand dug rough dirt held up by two by four bracing
a wheeled platform is the transport clydes on his back pulling himself along by an overhead rope hand over hand
clyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub basement laid into a foundation that dates back to the civil war
he crawls free shining his light as rats scurry in shadows
hes on his hands and knees at first because the ceilings so low
hes finally able to rise moving along at a crouch
and emerging into a proper sub tunnel
now able to walk normally he navigates the tunnels and comes to were just below the solitary wing
clyde has it rigged with all his needs computer spare cell phones various kinds of clothing even a shelf lined with snacks
he quickly shrugs off his custodians outfit revealing his prison jumpsuit beneath
he gazes up a welded steel ladder identical to four others in a row one for each cell
he checks his clamshell one last time tweaking the bad reception with a relay ballroom looks full
he clicks off his lamp and clamshell sets them on a shelf
he goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling
and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet
in deep darkness now he pulls his cell phone starts inputting a number boop
and he freezes
theres somebody in there with him
a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door
the figure reaches out pushes open the outer door a bit
faint light spills in revealing i came to talk
guess who wasnt in his cell
imagine my surprise
beautiful how you played us
getting yourself tossed into solitary pre rigged with exits from all five cells
whichever one we put you in you had your bases covered
faint smile i thought i was such a bad ass putting you down here
turns out i was doing what you wanted
thats how you play
make the other guy think its his idea
beat you came to talk so talk
if id done things differently made different decisions from the start we wouldnt have gotten to this point
but it happened
and here we are
here we are
beat your decisions put us here too
this mess is on both of us
you want to hold hands
whats your point
we cant change decisions weve made
we can only account for decisions we make from here
i know what mine will be
beat what about you
you gonna finish dialing that number or what
clyde hesitating thumb hovering over the number pad
if i dont
what are you offering
you looking to deal
im willing to listen
okay heres the deal
the deal is
there is no deal
off clydes look i told you
no more deals with murderers
im sticking to that
thats my decision
its what you taught me
strange as it sounds im grateful for the lesson
nick rises steps out pauses turns back
you make the right decision ill see what i can do for you
but the wrong decision is one youll have to live with the rest of your life
the moment stretches
clyde poised all down to this
in the end he cant help himself boop boop boop hits send
nick pushes the barred door shut
because like i said its a decision youll have to live with the rest of your life
which at this point i figure is
glances at watch another seconds
and turns the key in the lock klatch
clyde hears a sound
like a phone ringing sort of close but not muffled like the sound cantrell heard
clyde realization dawning thrusts his hand out and jerks the cot blanket up revealing the steel briefcase under his cot
he glances up to see nick gone
clyde scrambles to his portal yanks on the handle
angle on the hatch handle rattles now padlocked shut
fast cut dunnigan thrusts himself out of the tunnel cops grabbing his arms pulling him free
nick comes through the sally port at a fast stride through another door goes up the steps
clyde wheels around frantic as a caged tiger he lunges to the door rattling the bars
while nick pounds faster and faster up staircase after staircase
clyde enraged bellowing picking up the steel briefcase swinging it hard against the bars trying to batter through
and then stopping
a self awareness returning
perhaps its the clyde thats been missing for years the sane one
he sets the briefcase down
stands a moment
he sits down on the briefcase
pulls a small photo from his breast pocket
gazes at it
its his wife and daughter
he stares at them a while
tucks the photo back in his pocket
the detonation is staggering instantly vaporizing clyde and the cell hes in
blowing the bars right out of the stone on a wall of flame that overwhelms the lens
flame hurtling with express train force
and blasting tons of brick and mortar skyward
nick enters the shot as we dolly back with him walking away from the building going to dust and rubble b
camera pans him around now following him as he approaches davies standing with iger
iger is staring agog jesus
beat thank god that wing was empty
a car arriving behind them dunnigan getting out approaching
how do i explain this to the city
i think the mayor will have your back
nick approaches comes abreast of them
looks are traded with dunnigan and davies
a touch of sadness
words arent needed here
nick keeps walking pulls his cell phone starts dialing
he knows exactly where nicks going
long lens nick sitting
an arriving train moves massively into the shot pulling into the station
a squeal of brakes steel on steel
nick engulfed in a crowd of arriving passengers people getting off swirling and jostling all around him wiping frame
only two faces he wants to see
and there they are
he sweeps his family into his arms
the final moments of this movie are all about faces and joy
