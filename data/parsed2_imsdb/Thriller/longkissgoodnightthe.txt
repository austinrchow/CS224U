by shane black february assaulted from without by snowflakes
inside a bed dappled with moon shadow
a little girl fast asleep
the wind whistles and sighs outside
eyelids closed eyes roving beneath
then suddenly they snap open
a stifled cry
she thrashes for her stuffed bear as a soft voice says shhhhh
and theres mom kneeling beside her
vague shape in the dimness
the full moon throws light across one sparkling eye
mommy the men on the mountain
gone all gone now
strokes her hair im here
mommys always here and no one can ever hurt you
safe and warm
snug as a bug in a rug
beat ill sit with you think you can sleep
turn on the nightlight
the mother nods
passes her left hand gently over the girls forehead
close your eyes now
i love you
the child subsides breathing steady
the mother rises
regards her through the dimness
slowly turns heads for the door
flicks on a winnie the pooh nightlight her entire right forearm is slicked with blood
more blood on her czech made mp machine gun
she staggers just a little
passes out on the light
sits beside her daughters bed
the child sleeps peacefully
outside snow slithers at the glass
its snowing in southwestern ohio
before us nestled in the rolling hills a postcard slice of suburbia
super the legend three weeks earlier
its the town in the glass bubble the one god shakes to watch it snow
children dozens of them bursting from houses
slapping of screen doors
a horse driven sleigh is rattling down main street
flanked by kids
christmas carols droning from loudspeakers
happy laughing santa waves howdy chortling his hos in groups of three meanwhile hes really a grizzled old fire marshall named earl freezing his nuts off
beside him sits mrs
claus about whom we notice two things first shes the june in this june december pair and second shes to kill for an effortlessly beautiful woman
for the record meet samantha caine
how you holdin up
freezing my nuts off
santa produces a bottle of seagrams
starts to open it
put that away
earl complies grumbling
some teenage burnouts howl from a street corner ow
claus is hot
samantha squirms in her seat scowling
i cant take it earl this dumb costume is giving me a wedgie
driving me crazy but theres these kids here right you dont wanna be rootin in front of little billy age four yeah
look mommy mrs
claus chooses to go butt mining
this is little billy talking
age four kids unbelievable
sighs im too old for this earl
spare me i got a prostate the size of a melon
samantha stares at him
seriously half my lifes a doctors hand up my ass i should marry the fucker
say that a little louder theres a kid in back didnt catch it
its not that fucking little billy again is it
throughout the following narration we watch sam rallying the varsity cheerleaders showing off a gerbil to her seventh graders kneeling in church with her husband blessing herself absently fingering a
silver key which she wears round her neck and finally probing at a tiny ridged scar under her hairline
i keep hiring detectives but they never find anything
beat i was born days ago on the beach in new jersey
i entered the world fully grown wearing clothes i dont remember buying
nothing in the pockets but a single key filed smooth
beat im married now
nice guy early forties
i stand naked in the mirror and try to guess my age
thirty five maybe
i have lots of scars
samantha walks with her husband hal
coming out of st
pauls episcopal church
hal i gotta tell you of all the christmas pageants ive seen this was by far the most recent
aw honey i had teenage girls playing the wise men whatd you expect
well i thought they did fine
come on it was ground breaking stuff
the first nativity where joseph stares at the wise mens tits all night
she hugs him good naturedly
as they near their house an eight year old girl drops from a treehouse and comes running leaps into mommys arms hey you
the kid leaps into her arms as we hear her name is caitlin
shes my daughter and when i woke up on that long ago day she was two months grown in my belly
i dont know who put her there
i may never
i just know shes mine and shes about to turn eight
the family troops up the driveway to their suburban home
chipper little a frame
christmas lights abound
behind the house a vast frozen pond
it is idyllic
party in progress
in the corner caitlin puts pipe cleaner antlers on the gerbil
samantha shepherds her home room class past the punchbowl
she is radiant
earl surreptitiously nips from a silver flask
i teach now fifth grade
i have the key i wear it around my neck for luck
except for that and my name all traces of my prior life are lost
beat was i in love ever
did someone look in my eyes did i say darling ill never forget you
beat because fuck me darling i managed
across the room her daughter caitlin hangs with two young girls
shows off a plush teddy bear says his name is mr
perkins my mom named him for me
girl points whispers excitedly thats her
kid thats who
excitedly her mom shes got amnesia
a voice interrupts their reverie excuse me
the girls whirl around startled samantha is leaning on the desk behind them
she smiles amiably hello girls
caitlin im going to help dad with the refreshments
leans in whispers which ones dad
the girls look at her like shes grown a tail
a door kicked open wham
a nude couple on the bed
they look up startled as three men burst through the door
the leader a haggard looking man sporting a soup stain on his tie whoops thats the design sorry
mitch henessey private investigator and con man extraordinaire
he flashes a phony badge what the hell is this
dont give me an attitude sir
youre assuming i wont shoot your sorry ass and everyone knows when you make an assumption you make an ass out of u and mption
im sergeant madigan vice and if you cop a tude jerkoff i will see to it you spend the next ten years in prison getting ass fucked and if the

beat officer donleavy read him his rights
donleavy looks pale pasty
he stutters a few words
wanders away across the room
a trifle confused please this is my first i
ive never done this before ill do anything
sir listen to me
i understand youre not a wealthy man but in light of the damage this arrest will cause you we might be able to make an arrangement donleavy plops in a
the man in bed points to him is he all right
the remaining cop is swaying on his feet
like a tree in a hurricane
donleavy pukes all over the floor
we cut to theres the girl
the one in bed moments ago
she and henessey are dividing a wad of bills
we gotta stop using bums
lights a smoke forget it
they looked like cops
we pulled it off didnt we
it was embarrassing
you want i should hire actors for chrissake
these guys are cheap they work for food
so when they puke all over you is that like a refund
trin im pissin myself over here youre so funny
he indicates an envelope earmarked for him
labeled in magic marker samantha caine
new case honest to god chick with amnesia
you want the job
henessey opens the envelope
extracts a black and white head shot of samantha says immediately yep
yep yep yep
trin peers over his shoulder wasnt there a lady on tv named samantha
had a magic nose or something
chick lived with a faggy guy then in the last season it was a different faggy guy
heres what we do get on the horn to amnesia chick tell her yes
then tell her in she promised to give me a blow job
worth a try right
samantha and hal bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors
hal steers her away from a middle aged teacher
christ guys all over you like a cheap suit
thats funny theres a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit
she notices earl sitting in the bushes by the side of the building
he is speaking intently to the gerbil
someones gotta take my father home
samantha takes the keys from him
breathes deeply of the chill night air
surveys the scene
sighs this is all i ever wanted
at which point young caitlin says how would you know
switch gears a grim grey building
a tired tv set drones to an audience of one
lets call him one eyed jack
in fact lets give him one eye the other replaced by a patch
he smokes cigarettes stubs them out on the chairs armrest
throws offhand glances at the tv screen
so much for the flame swallowing santa of boone county
meanwhile ktva news journeyed to upper sandusky where santas own mrs
kringle turned out to celebrate her hubbys worldwide tour
after one look at her im thinking santa got what he wanted this christmas
the happy news chatter continues
jack isnt listening
jack isnt talking or breathing either
hes simply staring at the tv screen jaw slack
gotta be fuckin kidding
he screams as we cut to if you had to pick a night to die horribly youd be hard pressed to find a nicer one
a country highway
bathed in moonlight
crusted with snow
pontiac sunbird wending its way through the wooded slopes
samantha drives while earl the santa we saw earlier reclines still drunk
youre married what now five years
he makes a thumb circle
jabs his finger in and out of it you and hal how often you two
stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again
every chance we get
shut your piehole
dont get all snippy
earl do me a favor
every few words say hic and have bubbles come out your mouth okay
goddamnit im not drunk
would a drunk man have this much raw talent
he starts playing the hawaiian nose harp
in sams ear she cant help it snorts laughter the adult deer appears perfectly framed in the sunbirds headlights
sam looks up face etched in sudden terror
no time to think
swerves no dice
broadsides the animal and it comes through the windshield
all two hundred and fifteen pounds of it
fucks up their night altogether
actually it only makes it halfway through but the damn thing is alive
more than alive
squawling with pain and rage
a flailing hoof takes out earl
kills him in less than a second
collapses his skull
sam rides the wheel screaming
an antler gouges her chest
she swerves madly hits the tree doing
sam goes airborne
explodes through the windshield outward bound
shower of glass spritz of blood
and then shes flying
slow motion end over end
we lose all sound
silence as she tumbles
below and behind her the sunbird noiselessly erupts
fireball sky high sam floating
describes a lazy arc in mid air
disappears into the snow
swallows her leaves a silhouette
around her trees catch fire
she lies in her impromptu sarcophagus
out of sight
the flaming deer totters from the wreck thrashing
scene from a nightmare
nightmare part two from the snow from the human shaped divot arises a woman of blood
she stumbles from the drift
toward the wreck
and though its clearly sam caine under all that crimson theres something wrong about her eyes
en route to the car she kneels beside the suffering deer its flesh scorched and torn and kills it
puts it away with a sharp crack
ing blow to the head
stands eyes squirming with madness
the cars an inferno
earl is dead
she turns away wiping blood from her eyes comes face to face with a snowman
a jolly white fellow
charcoal briquettes for eyes
she watches fascinated as he melts in the blast furnace heat with warning she screams
crumples to the ground
the snowmans eyes fall out
he melts away and away
tract housing late model cars
mitch henessey delivers a christmas gift to his nine year old son todd not just any gift the midtown saturn orbiting precinct with action figures
henessey points to the box engrossed and heres the jail here see
escape chute for the borian hes a dinosaur guy moves quick dont take no shit neither

voice interrupts them an awkward pause
hey you go ahead um
hope you like the present
its awesome dad
mom though she
sighs she gets weird
on my birthday when you gave me the schwinn
she called bicycle stores to see if thered been any robberies
henessey manages to control his face
says tightly tell her i dont steal them locally
he watches forlorn as his son vanishes inside the house
christmas lights blinking feebly
we hear supered dear ma filled out the child support stuff last week
office got pissed under ex spouse i put spawn of satan dweller in eternal dark
just being honest ma lady wants me to die
as he reaches his car his beeper goes off
henessey on the phone
we hear id go without a ripple thats the truth
thanks ma for hiding the truth from me for so long
or maybe you believed in me

ill do it but were talking time and a half
plus a night on the town when i get back and no cockfights this time
samantha having survived
laid up now in an austere hospital room
listening to silence
stares out the window at a sunlit tree
frowns i want a cigarette why do i want a cigarette
outside snow slithers
her eyelids slowly closing
slides off the edge of consciousness
in the dream she stands on a windswept cliff before an incongruous full length mirror
staring at her reflection its bleeding from a scalp wound
she probes her head
nothing but the tiny ridged scar shes had for as long as she can remember
what do you want
the reflection eyes her grimly
i want a cigarette
i dont smoke
chuckles you used to
samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette
she raises it to her lips
her reflection mirrors her precisely
except samantha coughs chokes on the smoke while her bloody reflection takes a long satisfying drag
relax you can drop the act
nice and smooth take another hit
there you go
see how easy it comes back
they are now in perfect synchronicity
sam inhales easily
im coming back
you know that dont you
names charly by the way
youre gonna love me
the reflection grins
theres blood on its teeth
back at home business as usual pre christmas
a commotion has arisen gingerly bones still aching samantha moves toward the kitchen
hal and caitlin trail behind
honey you cant cook im not wrong about this
im remembering hal
things are coming back
trust me im a chef i know it
daddy make her stop
go to the garage and get me something anything
a veggie go man go
im hot to trot
hal worriedly exits to the garage
plucks a tomato from the fridge tosses it to caitlin who stands in the door
caitlin turns tosses it to sam tomato
who catches it plops it on the cutting board and proceeds to dice it to simthereens
razor thin slices
knife a blur
missing her fingers by millimeters never faltering like a mad mumblety pegger onion flying in
sam catches it
pieces flying up
and it becomes a bucket brigade
hal heaves veggies to caitlin who spins and relays to mom who slices dices purees and even makes curly fries
hal starts to lose it starts lobbing them at caitlin one after another she giggles starts throwing them overhand tomato
and now its a food fight pelting mom and the floor is covered with food as hal stumbles in laughing scoops up caitlin samantha shakes her head grinning dices to
pieces a last lovely radish
ends with a flourish ta dah
doesnt think flips the knife point up on one finger
tips it for balance
lobs a tomato
slings the knife without looking pins it to the wall ka chuk
everyone goes silent
the knife quivering
caitlin and hal turn as one gaping at her
she shrugs numbly
chefs do that
water gurgles through overhead pipes
furnaces hum and tick in the sweaty gloom
a shirtless man is tied to a chair
before him what looks like a young gq model
for the record timothy
he looks his captive in the eye as the guy blubbers please man
i dont know why you gotta kill me
but use the gun not the knife
as a fucking favor im begging you
itll be over soon
im scared of the knife
shit i cant handle getting shots at the doctors man please
what do you know about a town called santa claus

i dont know timothy stares him full in the face eyes narrowed
as though seeing into his brain
he nods satisfied
beat i can always tell you know
if someones lying to me
a little skill of mine something to trot out at parties
he slams home the knife
we dont see it but we feel the impact
the fbi mans face contorts in shock
inches away from timothy their eyes lock
a cellular phone beeps
timothy reacts annoyed
plucks it from his belt and flips it open timothy
message from mr
he shrugs at his captive
rolls his eyes
the guys still dying still on the knife
he says hes sorry but he needs you right away
somethings come up
im just finishing up here
then im going bunjee jumping
hes aware of your weekend plans and he apologizes
all right whats so fucking important
your old colleague one eyed jack
recently escaped from a high security prison as youre aware
but listen to this prior to his escape seems he saw something on tv that disturbed him
so much he had to be sedated
i saw it too
its called empty nest
how the fuck is it my business
the man was overheard talking to himself under sedation
beat he said charly baltimores alive sir
timothy is silent
i know its incredible sir but
if she were alive im thinking she might be in contact with the old man in pennsylvania
should i tap his phone yes
and tell daedalus im on my way
he clicks off face troubled
withdraws the knife
checks his clothing
not one speck of blood
a carton of marlboro reds hits the stack of groceries
hal looks at his wife bewildered
they were on sale
at the next register over a duo of canadians throw looks her way
confer in rapid fire french subtitled for us ooh jaimerais la baiser
subtitle id like to fuck her
the checker looks up smiles dont you love hearing people speak french
oui jveux etirer celle la autour dune chaise
comme je le vois une femme cest comme gumby avec des seins
subtitle ill stretch her over a chair women are merely gumbys with tits
he turns to samantha except sam isnt there
her arm shoots out
clamps on one of the men
by the throat
catches him like a fucking vice
her voice a sibilant hiss allez gumby etiriait le cou fils de pute
subtitle gumbys gonna stretch your neck motherfucker
eyes like steel
the man will go on to start a profitable construction business with the bricks he shits
jubilant cant contain herself i speak french
you bet your life fluent french whatever the fuck that means
chortles quand jetais a lecole jai eu un professeur qui sest fabrique du dentifrice
you just said when you were in school your teacher was made of toothpaste

pasty joe we called him
look the accents perfect so piss off
im a french chef ya hoo
samantha and daughter caitlin sing a hearty chorus of frere jaques
sam giggles caitlin looks nervous astride her new two wheeler bicycle while sam finishes removing the training wheels
caitlin points to her stuffed teddy bear
put perkins in the basket
perkins going in the basket
are the training wheels off
just pretend theyre still there
piece of cake
you can do it
nothing to be scared of
pretend youre one of the x men youre tough
lets go now
three two one
mom i cant do it swear samantha sets her sailing
the bike weaves side to side
hits the curb and topples with a crash
spills caitlin to the pavement
nows shes crying
i cant do it it hurts
samantha walks over briskly
face set in determined lines
you can do it
you dont want to but you can
my arm hurts please take me home
you can go home caitlin
you can ride there
an unpleasant note is edging into her voice
the louder the kid cries the more samantha starts to simmer
look i know youre afraid thats the whole point can you see that
now stop being a little baby and get on the damn bike
she hoists her onto the seat
caitlin cries and hollers
you gonna be afraid of things all your life
that what you want
my wrist hurts
something lets go
suddenly samanthas right in her face life is pain
get used to it
see you will ride this bike home princess
you will ride it and you will not fall again is that understood
eyes cold and lifeless
she is not herself
cut to caitlin huddles on the steps itching at her brand new wrist cast
eavesdropping on her parents
in the kitchen a counter top tv is on the three stooges
samantha is on the phone saying yes im three blocks past the gas station
thank you mr
henessey ill see you shortly
she hangs up as hal enters behind her
she doesnt turn around
samples the topping of a cream pie
stares at the linoleum floor
he regards her with angry vindictive eyes she rode all the way home
she didnt fall not once
she didnt cry
beat youre good
you should work with kids you know that
she said her wrist hurt
i didnt know it was broken god
i cant even remember what i said to her
hal takes a breath composes himself
we can still make six oclock mass you coming
sam surveys her perfect kitchen
runs her hand over a hanging pot
looks sadly at her husband
whispers a private detectives coming by he
hes found something
beat i may have to go away
for a bit
now please leave me alone
with a detective
jesus its the holidays sam are you deaf
i said leave me alone
go to church
drink some for me
they stand in tableau
an electric silence
broken quite suddenly by the sound of singing
outside the front door
the sweet strains of god rest ye merry gentlemen wafts in through the window
except the sweet strains aint so sweet
these carolers are terrible
missing by a country octave
sam and hal look at each other what the hell
the carolers continue their interesting rendition
all is quiet
all is bright
especially bright is the shotgun barrel pressed to the throat of the lead soprano
over and under combo
shotgun on top
he cannon on bottom
youd sing shitty too
samantha hurries to the door
carrying a bowl of festive m ms
just as she gets to the door the singing stops
footfalls running away thats odd
she opens the door
shes eye to eye with one eyed jack
he swings the big gun
slams the barrel into her
glass shatters m ms everywhere
she gapes at him dumbstruck unable to think
hurry it up lady we need a decision live or die she grabs the gun barrel
wrenches the gun
on the steps caitlin howls eyes like saucers mommy
sams cry is a veritable shriek
hal launches himself from the kitchen doorway
pounces on jack snarling brave useless
for his trouble gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace airborne
rolls over and over on broken ribs jack kicks samantha in the gut
she collapses onto the stairs
splinters the banister
thats when he sees caitlin
top of the stairs paralyzed
jack is already moving forward
spin cocks the shotgun draws a bead promptly slips on festive m ms
gun goes off wham
a flat concussion
the banister explodes
a storm of wood chips as samantha surges up the stairs toward her daughter jack
on the ground
the wall disappears three inches from caitlins head
blown to shreds you can see outdoors
samantha doesnt miss a beat
grabs her daughter flings her outside
through the hole in the wall
takes her by the belt and fucking hurls her out into space
two stories up
the kid is ejected flailing
floats in slow motion
across a ten foot gap into the treehouse
sails head over heels into the place
hits with a crash
alive and unhurt
samantha didnt even look
didnt need to
here comes jack
up the staircase
samantha launches herself down the stairs
collides head on down they go
jack rolls to his feet
propels her into the kitchen
she hits spray of cat food
across the linoleum slams to a stop
cupboard pops open out comes the ironing board
falls into place snap
a gun blast disintegrates it
reveals sam cowering behind
i want my eye back bitch
samantha struggles to her feet
jack abandons the shotgun
takes the iron down from its spot on the shelf slams it against her head
whats wrong with you fight me
close on tv stooge joe besser mugs wildly takes a pie in the face
jack raises his arm for the killing stroke samantha takes hals cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in his face
comes from nowhere
back foot planted body twisting entire organism focused into the outstretched arm whack
we have never seen anyone move this fast
startled by what shes done the glass dish is splintered into his head
it sticks there
hits the linoleum
she straddles him breathing hard
the barking dog jingle bells plays inanely in the background
pokes the body
pokes it again
she leans forward
grips the neck and wrenches crack
just making sure
she out of it
glaring at her own hands as if demanding an excuse for their behavior
there is pie filling on her fingers
she kneels beside the corpse catatonic
absent mindedly licks the bloodied cream
hal is standing in the doorway
he has seen samantha break the mans neck
she looks at him frowns
it took me three seconds
thats good huh
he stares dumbstruck
snaps out of it
we gotta find caitlin
she gets up
we run with her to the front door she flings it open and collides with mitchell henessey
runs right into him
the kids okay shes in my car what the hell is going on
henessey spins as four police cruisers pull up
vomit up a bevy of cops swarming toward the house
he spins back to samantha as she collapses to the floor
super the legend one week later
early morning quiet
henessey and samantha are throwing suitcases into the back of his battered chrysler
sams looked better
kneels beside caitlin says softly that man who tried to hurt us
if i stay here
other people will come
i have to leave
just for a little while
caitlin looks at the floor
samantha reaches in a cupboard
produces a box of candles
lights a match touches flame to one of them
i want you to light a candle and keep it in the kitchen window
and never ever let it go out because as long as it burns
it means youre thinking of me
and if im alone
if its dark and im lost
its how ill find my way home
she touches caitlins wrist cast
pain in her features
she grabs a marker pen and writes a telephone number on it
thats for a portable phone
i keep it with me you call me anytime you dont worry about the bill
and last but not least she reaches behind her head
unhooks the key the one she wears around her neck
slips it over her daughters head
looks up at hal eyes brimming
he whispers no matter what you find im not scared
not of you
as it fades behind henesseys chrysler
leaving behind porch bound elders dimestore clerks
grinning children hair like spun straw
dissolve to henessey sings with the radio
hes got the lyrics wrong im not talking bout the linen
and i dont wanna change your life
samantha endures as much as she can
speaks up movin in
its not linen
the songs not about linen
shivers im freezing
turn on the heater
it doesnt work but it makes a very annoying noise which distracts from the cold
clears her throat so youre a former cop
atlanta was it
stop me if im out of line but im curious
how did you
i mean where six other detectives failed
plus my secretary used her feminine wiles
shes got two one wile per side
no kidding you can see em coming around a corner you got time to comb your hair
nice kid youd dig her
here we are
as they clamber from the car henessey shoves his sunglasses into his sportcoat
sings putting my glasses in my cooooat
samantha looks at him like hes sprouted wings
i sing what i do so ill remember it
turning off the downstairs liiiight
samantha smiles thinly
the mans a lunatic
an old walrus mustached irishman ushers them down a concrete hallway
the old man hangs back with henessey
whispers the elder trelawney rented to her in aye
neer could bring himself to dispose of her things
ifaith shes welcome to whatsoeer she wishes for neer has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye divil take me if im lyin
henessey lights a cigarette says do me a favor
say always after me lucky charms
always after me lucky charms
just needed to hear that
filled with disused tables lamps farm implements
jimmy hoffa watches tv in the corner
see anything you recognize
yeah this dirt used to be outside my window shut up and let me look
sighs im sorry mr
henessey im a little on edge
surveys the musty compartment faraway look in her eye
says softly i can feel her
like a ghost
beat we could walk away you know
theres still time we could just
leave her dead
she hefts a suitcase onto a bench
opens it draws a sharp breath ay i yi
clothes to kill for
the finest the best
sam peeks at the tags size four no way
you know how long its been since i could wear a size four
beat cant be mine
she checks the case for initials c
in his book well dressed is clean underwear
holds up a small manila envelope
addressed to a guy
whats in it
another guys address
two addresses is basically what im saying
meanwhile her hands still pawing through the suitcase
she feels it
at the bottom of the case
lifts up the mound of fabric hkm sniper rifle
sam looks like she just took a stomach punch
up until now it couldve been adrenaline
she could still be just a schoolteacher
a rifle that changes everything
she plunks the clothing back in place
anything else in there
yeah well take a look at this
he holds up the envelope addresses to one nathan windeman
fishes in his coat brings out samanthas check
written to him earlier that day
cut to nathan windeman is in a bad mood
a frail looking man mid seventies
tiredly spooning a bowl of soup
his sister alice watches tv nearby
in her lap a pomeranian cleans itself
windeman scowls alice please
alice stares at him
your dog alice
it and my appetite are mutually exclusive
whats wrong with the dog
hes been licking his asshole for three straight hours
i submit to you that theres nothing there worth more than an hours attention and i should think whatever hes attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there
wouldnt you agree
the old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door
the phone rings
nathan snatches it up hello
the voice is soft
controlled hello mr
windeman i got this number from a realtor in pennsylvania
id like to speak with you
who is this
you tell me mr
my full name please
god it really is you
chapter they think youre dead everyone thinks my full name
then you dont know your name
he chews his lower lip mind racing
jesus no joke this is her
he fights to control his voice your full name
is charlene elizabeth baltimore
a man in shirtsleeves flips a switch
speaks into a headset signal daedalus
we just got her she made contact
initiating phone trace
charly dont talk just listen we have to meet understand
we have to meet right away
meet me off i
highmile exit salt pepper lounge
she hangs up
nathan stares trembling
turns to alice standing in the doorway
swallows hard says a former student
is in trouble
she hangs up the telephone in the ladies room
stands alone in the stillness
hands to her head mind churning
turns checks to make sure the door is locked
props her suitcase on the sink and opens it
flips back the mound of clothing and there it is
the pieces disassembled of an m sniper rifle
her trembling hands find the parts seemingly of their own volition
gauging their feel
and then slowly
knowing how they go together
she snaps the barrel in place click
the sound breaks her reverie
she drops the thing like its alive
looks down trembling
also in the case a wicked looking hunting knife
she picks it up gingerly
shiny brand new
turns it over in her hand fascinated by the play of light off the blade
her reflection in the mirror
she frowns it frowns
she turns away the reflection doesnt
it stays right fucking put except now its smiling
sam feels something wrong
spins back toward the mirror her reflected arm comes through the looking glass
reaches into sams world and slices for her throat
samantha jerks comes awake in the passenger seat of henesseys plymouth
looks over to see if he noticed hes honking his horn at a traffic jam
sea of taillights dead ahead
what the hell is this
we dont have time for this of all the cocksucking bullshit whoa
class drive a little truck on the side do you
what are you a mormon
no maam its just that
well when we met youre all oh fooey i burned the darn cupcakes
now you go into a bar ten minutes later sailors come running out they cant take it
just then three police cruisers blow by sirens screaming
henessey frowns puzzled
what the hell
lemme check the scanner
he switches on a police band radio
listens hears without endangering the hostages over
roger that two niner
pcp confirmed hes on a fuse please provide backup over
conneaut im waiting on special weapons sorry over
police flashers spinning
cop cars incoming
slamming to a halt
disgorging uniformed cops
the diner is rapidly surrounded
its a cheery decor the giant roofbound santa all in stark contrast to the screaming we hear dimly from within
hostage drama unfolding
the perps a big ugly meatloaf with his mitts on a waitress
shes sixteen shes a baby
shes sucking the barrel of his shotgun
his finger on the trigger
from outside we hear the cops mr
shotgun snorts laughter
does a little dance yells im the man
im the man
i elicit the explicit
the police are just starting to re route traffic
a highway cop signals to henessey turn around go back
swings wide when suddenly a hand clutches his arm
he looks over and suppresses a shiver samanthas eyes have gone dead and cold
she lights a cigarette shakes out the match and says go up this hill
drive up the fucking hill
now henessey shivers
cranks the wheel as we cut to samantha flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees
where the shit did you get that
she deftly assembles the sniper rifle
rests the rifle barrel on a dead branch
flicks on the starlight scope
sam goddammit youre gonna kill someone
she ignores him
focuses through the scope
pov samantha framed in spectral green the diners interior
through a tiny window a limited view of the kitchen
hes in there
girl eating both barrels
samanthas jaw tightens
thats half a mile away are you fucking crazy
hk m assault rifle
at three hundred yards vertical drop six inches
shotgun leans in
whispers something to the waitress
hes gonna do the girl
how the fuck can you tell
she steadies the rifle
i read lips
shotgun dies on his feet
spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt hamburger
samantha slams the trunk of the chrysler
gets in the passenger side without a word
henessey pulls away
samantha stares straight ahead
gives a high brittle laugh
took care of it
knew i could
she laughs again
henessey favors her with a look reserved for people with major deformities
suddenly she says pull over
he stops the car
she gets out
stumbles across the shoulder
lights a smoke with trembling hands
had to he
he wouldve killed her
oh god i took him such a good shot
i felt proud of it such a shot jesus how could i be proud
sobs im scared
i want to go home
henessey kneels beside her awkwardly
she clutches his shoulder
presses her head to his chest
yes it certainly is
cut to three stories below the white house proper
the president is seated in his robe and slippers
before him sits a panel of three national security adviser deputy director of the cia and another man in his sixties sporting a distinguished mane of silver hair
the president addresses him mister perkins
frowns please say it again im a little slow
better yet ill try it
you lost an operative a trained counterassassin and you just saw her on tv in a christmas parade
the silver haired man appears unperturbed
and no by the way it didnt escape us that he shares his surname with caitlins teddy bear the one mom named he nods says on tv thats correct
its two weeks old intelligence just caught it
you recruited this woman in the late seventies
for chapter yes
i was a friend of her fathers you see and
i took her in
well it looks like she returned the favor now doesnt it
throws up his hands unbelievable
you people you dump this on me then next week youre screaming wheres our funding
ill tell you where it is can you say health care
the head of the cia pipes up mr
president please calm down
the cia bears no responsibility for this problem
thanks for sharing kent
how many double agents you got on the payroll last count
that controversy has been thoroughly dealt with and if there still exists a leak perhaps this
woman agent of his if i may sir colonel baltimore hasnt had classified access since
beat but thank you kent for trying to fuck me in the ass
he directs his baleful gaze at the president
lights a pipe
im afraid rooting out double agents may have to wait
the primary threat is the woman
her specialty is counterassassination a horseshit turn of phrase which implies the other fellow shot first but in point of fact shes a takeout artist of the first order
nearly disposed of our friend the beard down in cuba a few years back
specializes in long rifles accurate to a mile and a half
presumed dead now after eight years back in the field agenda unknown
she knows enough to hurt us
i believe you
just one question beat what in pluperfect hell is she doing in a christmas parade
henessey is on the phone to his ex wife
aw cut me a break fran

i dont want you around todd hear me
shrink told me what those men did to you in prison
this is a christian household my sons not gonna develop any
for a moment her ignorance is so stunning hes speechless
then he slams down the phone
returns to the pumps where samantha leans against his car still dazed
looks up at him says i still cant believe it
youre saying my hands didnt even shake
henessey doesnt look at her
puts the nozzle back in the pump
crosses to the driver side without a word
whats the matter with you
youre the matter
look you wanna keep going good luck
im driving back to ohio
youre free to come with me
what are you telling me
he gets into the car
starts the engine
samantha reacts distraught
leans in kills the ignition
pulls him out of the car
goddammit lady im taking you home
she slaps him
he falls back stunned
ill spell it out for you ready
i have no future i cant go home
until i know whats happening im in prison you know how that feels

marion illinois real shithole

clears her throat um

seven years ago atlanta pd
me and my partner we handled a lot of impounded shit
fucker hated me boy
one weekend when he was conveniently gone
some bearer bonds disappeared from his office
and lo and behold when the police responded to an anonymous tip youll never guess what just happened to be sitting in my closet
your partner put them there
laughs hell no i did i stole the fucking things
samantha frowns a little thrown then she snorts loses it
they both lean against his chrysler
now every dollar i hand my kid he asks his mother did i steal it
he smiles ruefully
a pause then no more killing
samanthas voice is cool and level no more killing
she blows her nose
it was a helluva shot wasnt it
a gunmetal grey sky looms overhead
the aforementioned lounge is a faded old roadhouse gravel parking lot strewn with mud covered trucks
the kind that get a man laid in these parts
henesseys plymouth pulls into the lot rolls to a halt
hell never get any
samantha and henessey enter blinking in the dimness
around them drunk mid day cowboys
stringy haired girls in their ample laps
samantha consults her watch quarter til
any time now
they sit at the counter
henessey flags the bartender
signals for a beer
lights a cigarette blows smoke nice crowd
youre just jealous of their girlfriends
who wouldnt be
corner booth theres a beaut
while youre doing her doggie style you can pop the zits on her back
samantha shoots him a look
on a tv above the bar a british sounding cnn announcer is saying violence in northern ireland continues today despite a plea by british prime minister john major samantha sits
draws a sharp breath
he shoots her a questioning look i just
got a flash of something blinks i hurt my father
you remember your father
thats whats strange
shakes her head if i saw him on the street i
she rubs her eyes
her voice breaks
shes utterly miserable
henessey leans in says softly ms
caine last week at a party i ran into a girl i knew from college and we chatted for a few minutes
and it wasnt til i was driving home on the freeway that i remembered that id screwed her in the back of a car once
beat everyone forgets
he pats her arm
thats your helpful story
no see alls im saying is youre not alone
oh shut up
i gotta use the head
he stands heads off
samantha nervously lights a cigarette
the bartender suddenly puts a beer in front of her
she reaches for her purse
he waves it away points beside her
the assassin called timothy sits down two stools away
another in a long line of bad investments
just saw the ring on your finger
he reveals a surprisingly winning smile says do i know you from somewhere
total pickup line lets forget i said that
still staring in her eyes
noting absolutely no recognition on her features
she gives him a cursory smile
thanks for the drink
i dont know you
timothy nods slowly
no you dont do you
id know if you did
i can tell if someones lying
smiles sorry to bother you
he takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth
sits a very puzzled look on his face
adjusts his coat collar whispers into a concealed transmitter okay people i got what i needed
wait until she comes out
then do them both
beat walk soft we got local law
he sits back as two sheriffs deputies suddenly enter doffing their stetsons
cross to the bar
henessey coming out of the bathroom
sees the deputies
grabs samantha by the elbow
tosses down a fin steers her toward the door
sotto what are you doing
on your nine
so you shot a guy in the head yesterday
we wait outside
people shouldnt shoot other people in the head
during that show with the little girl whos a robot
they emerge into the chill air
breath pluming from their mouths
samantha surveys the parking lot
grabs henessey points a late model car pulls into the gravel lot
thats an old guys car
how do you know
because theres an old guy in it
they cross toward the car
she frowns points to his coat
you think im gonna shove it down my pants
shoot my damn dick off
so now youre a sharpshooter
as they approach the other car the engine stops
the door opens and a middle aged man emerges it aint nathan
he pauses lighting a cigarette
she strides right up henessey in tow
flashes a dazzling smile slow motion
the guy drops his lighter darts a hand inside his coat with practiced ease
pulls out a oh shit
samantha tackles henessey
hurls them both to the ground
during their fall stuff happens she clutches his sportcoat grips his
special through the fabric and squeezes
a sharp report bam
the jacket shredded
hitman just caught two in the chest
he goes over backwards gun spitting sam and henessey hit the ground
back to regular speed
henessey rolls over stunned
samanthas staring at her hand wondering how in the hell it just did that
they scamper to their feet
running hellbent for leather toward the plymouth
they never make it
another hitman steps calmly from the trees
stands at the shoulder of the highway full view of the parking lot
adopts a two fisted stance
draws a bead locks on target leaves his feet
takes to the air as a black le sabre swerves off the highway with no advance warning and demolishes the bastard wham
the car roars across the lot nathan windeman at the wheel
the snapped in two hitman announces nathans arrival by flying through the window in an explosion of glass
caroms off a table and bounces head over heels
leaps up and bolts for the door right behind the sheriffs deputies as the black le sabre slews to a stop showering gravel nathan shouts at sam and henessey get
both of you now
they pile into the backseat
nathan floors it
peels out bouncing onto the highway and meanwhile here comes timothy
on the run
barks into his transmitter east theyre going east
head them off
he begins to run we have never seen anyone run this fast
nathan kicks in the afterburners
squinting cant see
wipers squeaking to and fro
erasing the hitmans blood
henessey is trembling samantha comatose
nathan steals a look in the rear view mirror
gets his first good view of samantha
reacts stunned charly
jesus christ i dont believe what im seeing youre so fat
this is not what she expected to hear
um i mean
what in gods hell have you been eating you look positively bovine
yards down the highway
beside a parked car a guy with an elephant gun
oh god no more
the big rifle bucks concussively
the car window splinters
does not break
put it in myself
almost as an afterthought he swerves slightly
crunches the gunman against the parked car
his screaming visage goes by an inch from samantha he coughs blood onto her window
timothy on the move
runs breakneck through the woods
jumps fallen logs
in and out through the trees as scenery whips past
in the backseat henessey is trembling samantha comatose
nathan snaps his fingers sharply charlene darling my name is caine
exasperated yes yes you said that on the phone
must i point out to you that the letters in the name sam caine when rearranged spell out amnesiac
your mind was missing a name so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition
samantha reacts floored
the schoolteacher that was your cover
your memory was gone you got confused and you bought your own cover
this ridiculous ohio housewife business its a fantasy you wrote the bloody thing
its not a fantasy im in the fucking pta
youre an assassin for the united states government
beat i ought to know i trained you
henessey is so shocked hes laughing beautiful
a forty foot embankment damn near vertical
plunging to the road below
topped by a chain link fence
timothy hits the fence at a dead run
up and over
pitches head over heels down the embankment bouncing
hits bottom in a shower of dirt rolls comes up
amp in a two fisted grip and theres nathans car
blows by doing
timothy swivels calmly blasts an entire clip at the retreating car
shot after shot like a machine sam screams as the side windows collapse inward
nathan rides the wheel swerving
what happened to bulletproof
the side windows were next i swear
watching them go
he tried right
did his best tomorrows another day without missing a beat timothy walks out in the middle of the road
another car coming
he snaps in a fresh clip
raises his fist and pumps one through the fast approaching windshield
kills the driver
the car throws a skid
slewing sideways at him
onrushing juggernaut immense
he vaults the hood without breaking stride
catches the drive side doorhandle jerks then hes in and out comes the corpse and the car never stops moving
completes an out of control showering muddy water
and then hes stomping the gas
leaving behind a wet and very surprised looking corpse
timothy guns it eyes locked dead ahead on the le sabre hears a screech
whips his eyes to the rearview mirror police cruiser
fishtailing onto the road behind him
falls in behind siren wailing
one of the deputies from the bar
nathan fishes a gun from his coat
hands it to samantha
here you might as well have one too
how many do you carry
one shoulder one hip and one right next to mr
wally pats his groin where most patdowns never reveal it as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another mans groin
henessey looks out the back windshield says got a tail
nathan looks swears
the chase cars gaining on them
lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest
he accelerates into a curve
rockets past a connecting road as without warning another cop car skids out of the side road after him
the other deputy
going too fast swerves
plows into the deputy headlong
the cop cars tires blow out as its spun degrees
timothys car careens into a gulley bam
hits a dead stop
hood shears off goes flying
back end sticking up tires spinning
the horn blares continuously
up above the other cop arrives brakes to a halt door opens and out he comes
helps deputy clamber from his crippled black and white
together they leap down into the gulley guns drawn
cringing as the long hoooooooonnnnnk continues unabated
approaching the crashed car
walking up guns at their sides
they jitter and twitch
topple over dead slide to the bottom of the gulley
inside the car we see that a very annoyed timothy is also very conscious
splayed against the drivers side door
holding one hand down on the horn hoooooooonnk
he releases it
on the radio conway twitty is singing
he puts a shot through the radio
climbs from the car and stares off down the road
of nathan and his companions there is neither whisper nor breath
nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees
the car is covered with branches
he watches through a gap as two police cars go by on the distant highway
your father was in the british sis assigned to the irish situation
after he was murdered in his friend perkins recruited you for chapter a black bag operation working out of the u
charly is overloaded
trying to keep up not wanting to fall presidential orders come down
youre to flush out a terrorist by the name of daedalus
you never complete the mission electing instead to die of all things despite clear orders to the contrary
and dead you remain until without preamble you re emerge eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier
would you lay off the weight
i think we can safely assume daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it
damn i cant drive around in this thing
beat any idea where we can go to stash this car
her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something
one address left
i recognize it now
i think it belongs to a friend
henessey stares at her
as nathan reaches for the envelope his coat falls open and samantha gasps his left side is soaked with blood
perhaps youd best drive
the house is actually an old converted mill
beyond it frozen landscape stretches to the lakeshore
in the barnyard a scruffy looking cowboy type is splitting logs on a tree stump
drops the axe
scoops up an armload of firewood
comes around the corner drops the logs startled
an unlikely trio approaches
levels a revolver
samantha says dont be afraid we dont want to hurt you
beat i just want to know who you are
seeing her his eyes go wide he locks her in a whooping bear hug shouts picks her up spins her around laughing
henessey and nathan stare
the strange man lets call him luke stands awkwardly in the dooryard
shifting from foot to foot
nathan watches him dispassionately from the tree stump
gun on his knee
sighs look is this americas funniest practical videos or something
the door bangs open and samantha comes out of the house
crosses to the tree stump kneels before nathan
his voice is a harsh rasp let me do it
he bats her away administers his own first aid
luke pipes up exasperated i cant believe you dont remember dating me
charly please you pursued me for months
i caught you and forgot you
its december youll remember
looks at her face
stops chuckling takes a sudden interest in the ground
sam crosses to henessey standing nearby
takes him aside whispers sotto this is ridiculous
what do we do with this guy
dont ask me i just work here
did you bump pelvises with him or not
and you kid cathead caitlin
um could he be the
i dont know
beat its coming back though
little details about him
she studies luke
i know hes got a pin in his leg car accident
i know he cuts his own hair
thinks rush limbaughs an ass
i know he sits down when he pees
i know enough
youre giving me a stiffy
just then nathan is hit with a dreadful sounding cough
it wracks him
doubles him up
luke blurts out goddammit hes dying
let me call the poor bastard an ambulance
nathan grits his teeth no ambulance
the car i ordered will be here soon
windeman please let him help you
i know this man i
im pretty sure i slept with him
nathan presses a bandage to his side
im about to faint
and if you call an ambulance i will fucking kill you
he pitches forward into henesseys arms
beside the lakeshore luke and samantha walk side by side
rack focus to the porch nathan is laid out on a chaise lounge
henessey beside him applying cold compresses
the older man stirs coming awake
tries to sit up henessey nudges him flat again
shes with luke
thats his name luke
goddammit i told you yeah yeah we werent real big on what you told us
i had him call you an ambulance so shoot me
should be here within fifteen minutes
henessey presses a cloth to the mans head
the guys story checks out
sam knows things about him
stuff only a lover would know
just watch them
dont worry about it
chick signs my checks im gonna watch her get aced
lie back down
lies back down
youre not fooling anyone dear boy
bemused youd wash her feet and drink the water
cut me a break nimrod
shes married with a kid
speaks eyes faraway my star pupil
smiles thinly that man in pennsylvania yesterday
the one at the diner that was hers wasnt it
howd you know
nods i saw the news report they found a shell casing a thousand yards away helluva shot
tell me about daedalus whats his story
arms broker man without a face
veteran of baader meinhoff and the red brigades
hes rumored to be based in the u
doesnt travel much they say
too afraid of metal detectors the poor sods got a foot long piece of steel in his leg
at which point henessey stops
a pin mr
a surgical pin
he scuffs his shoe in the porch dust
eyes narrowed where the hell
i know i just heard that somewhere something about a
his eyes widen oh fuck
points to the lake nathan that son of a bitch has one in his leg
nathan freezes thoughts racing
swears violently you blithering idiot the son of a bitch wasnt her lover he was her target hes daedalus
thats how she knew all that shit not from dating him she studied the fucker to take him out
he takes off for the lake at a dead run
behind him the bloodied nathan drags himself to his feet and lurches off the porch stumbling
refusing to go down
at the lakeside luke walks behind samantha
talking softly in her ear smiling
she hears something
a ratcheting noise drawing closer hmmm
wishes she hadnt a bell ranger helicopter is descending over the lake
inside timothy shoulders a bolt action rifle coolly professional
fires kicks up dirt at henesseys feet
stops the fucker cold
on the shore luke smiles at samantha says sure dont look like an ambulance does it
slugs her in the face
drops her to the ice like a broken doll
out of the darkness we hear a news commentator
far away or long ago
a television image fills the screen
black and white
the legend belfast northern ireland over footage of a sidewalk bombing
were back in time the year
a crisp looking brigadier is speaking to the off camera reporter the bombing has been linked to the ulster volunteer force which as you know is the counterpart of the
provisional ira and the most violent of the protestant paramilitary groups
an announcers face replaces him despite threats of reprisals brigadier baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut uvf supply lines especially from tripoli lybia
president nixon concurs that
a battered tv volume turned low
snoozing in a chair a rumpled older man its the brigadier the one we just saw speaking on tv
a calendar on the table identifies the date as june
pinups of rock stars
a young girl is awake dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket
she inspects her handiwork
human looking lump
one last look at the wooden jesus on the wall creeps from the room
past the sleeping brigadier
to the front door
she checks over her shoulder nervous
taps out five digits
shuts off the alarm
unlocks the door and slips out
the boys name is gregory
sixteen with a quick easy grin
huddled beneath a tree with him the girl is gelatin
youve never made it with a boy then
theres nothing odd about it
im only sixteen
youre fourteen and not a day more
here now im right youre blushing
look what if im ignorant
its my father we never stay in one place i never meet bloody anyone
saw him on the telly
think hed kill me
im a nasty one i am
he slides a hand under her sweater
she stiffens terrified and exhilarated as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb
you know what ill bet youve never even kissed a boy
now have you
beat aye but you want to
he leans in
she leans forward
a jerky tentative duckling on the road to swan dom
their lips touch
across the road the windows blow out in her fathers flat
she spins scream caught in her throat as armed men rush from the house
through the door the one she left unlocked
stutter of small arms fire
she whirls on gregory realizes only then that the guy is laughing
thanks for shutting off the alarm you bloody papist bitch
he slaps her full across the face
tell the press the ulster force claims full credit
he spins and flees
walls racing past shot to pieces run run run into her bedroom and lurches to a stop screaming propped against the wall
by the bed
hes still alive
the man has dragged himself in here
he refused to die simply couldnt you see
not until he reached his daughter
two pillows jammed beneath a blanket
the brigadier just stares at them
his face slack
white and gastly
shifts his gaze to his daughter
tears running from his dulled eyes
he raises the pistol to his head
did they pay you
on a young girls dissolve into insanity we fade out
sound echoing away
waking is slow
samantha opens her eyes
hazy out of focus
tries to rub her eyes cant
somethings wrong what the helld she do with her hands
theyre stretched over her head
bound with cord
suddenly shes very awake
the basement of the old converted mill
a drafty windswept place full of old broken timbers
a river runs through it
a stream at any rate
the waters are still and frozen now
above the stream a great wooden wheel
smaller corollary of the wheel outside
mounted on the same axis
samantha is tied to that wheel
lashed to its side affixed to it like a goddess to a greek sailing ship
now the bad news the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can turn
and it will plunge samantha under the freezing water
beneath the ice
bound hand and foot
strapped to the wheel wearing only a nightgown she is utterly helpless
the man known as daedalus aka luke stands before her giving instructions to the ubiquitous timothy
he looks up at samantha
seeing her eyelids flutter he tosses her a cherry wave
gone is the gee whiz country boy schtick in its place a frightening arrogance
he tosses her his cheeriest wave well good afternoon
if it isnt the forgetful spy
how you feeling
not so fresh
samantha struggles against her bonds
takes a look around at her predicament
timothy stands at the edge of the ice
watching her intently
smiles thinly you
the man from the bar
look at her
shes not faking it she doesnt know me from adam
daedalus shakes his head frowning its not that i dont trust my compatriot colonel baltimore
in fact i had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine until you showed up here
beat meanwhile i just got around to reading the papers theres the small matter of an incident upstate
long range rifle shot blew a man out of his socks
coldly you can see where im coming from
im trying to pull of the biggest job of my career
i have to know
how much you really remember
and who youve told
i didnt tell a soul i swear
well soon know
he crosses toward a large red button
set into a wooden beam
samantha thrashes at the bindings
looks down at the water where it intercepts the mammoth wheel
fighting panic is
is this a torture thing
the torturing of beautiful women albeit politically incorrect is an addiction with me
beat a woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain
witness the beauty of childbirth
please im getting all misty
look untie me ill make any face you want
lets not and say we did
do you smoke
youll last longer
now hush yourself and take a deep breath
were gonna do the torture thing
he hits the button
an electric whine the big wheel turns
feet first into the water
arms stretched above her head
she plunges below the surface
a new dimension in pain
frozen mind numbing
she writhes against the wheel
its like a crushing vice is ripping her limb from limb
she opens her eyes briefly
discovers shes not alone a mere foot from her face the bloated corpse of the drowned nathan
staring away and away
blue with cyanosis
meanwhile back on the surface daedalus turns to his right hand man who says were running on schedule i just secured the tanker
were borrowing it from carbide in south carolina
cargo listed as fire retardant
nods juice up the bird we head out soon as im done here
hits the red button again
the wheel reverses itself
creaks and moans turning samantha breaks the surface
gasping for air
the freezing wind plasters the nightgown to her
take all the air you can thats right
if you need to vomit do it now
samantha face twisted
timothy looks her in the eye
shakes his head you dont remember at all
the greatest night of your life shit drown this ungrateful wench
daedalus alone with his captive
on her features unbridled hatred
he chuckles talk to me colonel
is my identity safe
the truth and ill shoot you in the head
nice and quick
otherwise youre in for a long night
who did you talk to
he shakes his head makes a tsk tsk gesture
smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch
hate to see you like this charly
i heard you were a helluva spy once
without warning her head snaps upward eyes cold
voice not her own watch your back
im not done yet
thats a very funny joke
youre an entertaining woman
he hits the button
she plunges beneath the surface
daedalus walks over to one corner
takes out a pipe
picks up a book
underwater sam thrashes and jerks to and fro
dead nathan mocking her
there under the water the memories come
in a flood
stark and vivid
the trunk of a car opens revealing a patch of night sky
mostly obscured by two familiar individuals theres one eyed jack remember him
few years younger
one eyeball heavier
the other man is timothy
he looks in the trunk
okay ill signal daedalus
your money will be waiting and jack
do yourself a favor do her and dump her im serious
dont get cute try to play doctor first
i made that mistake
the lid slams shut
the world of rushing madness memories unspooling now faster and faster memory flash a cliff overlooking the ocean
our heroine for it is unquestionably samantha is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff
one eyed jack produces a syringe from a leather case
rolls up her sleeve
starts to administer the injection
he cant resist
cant help loosening the buttons on her shirt
her eyes snap open
and before it even registers shes grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep into his eye then shes up and running
along the cliff toward the car
jack howling in pain stumbling
draws his gun and shoots her
in the head
she pitches backward
tumbles from the cliff
rushes headlong toward the waters below getting smaller here
she breaks the surface
gasping for breath
shrieks a sound ripped from her by the pain the cold by her ruptured sanity
she hangs there
daedalus cant help it
a chill dances up his spine watching
she is not afraid
she is not whimpering
she is looking directly at him
with a sick smile
make you a deal
let me go now
ill leave you the use of your legs
bargain trust me
daedalus struggles to recover his poise
how did you find me
who knows about this place who have you told
charlys eyes bore into his i let you touch me cowboy
i think i need a bath
daedalus stabs the red button
the big wheel turns
into the water goes charly
going down for the third time
here we are again in the world of silence and blinding pain
despair and madness but now theres something else now theres rage
it takes losing most of the flesh from her right wrist
but she frees the hand
wrenches it loose
the water turns soupy red around it
fingers numb so fucking cold breath running out
she darts her right hand forward
toward the obscenely bobbing corpse of nathan
does something grotesque jams her hand hideaway gun its right where he said right beside mr
semi auto steel jackets
rage inside her
death in her hands
the wheel creaks
the terrorist in the western boots watches her emerge face first she comes up firing
the first slug takes him in the knee
blows it to scraps
he collapses howling
she shifts aim
the red button
hits it dead on
stops the wheel
unties her captive hand
blows to splinters the wood surrounding her feet
leaps to solid ground as daedalus looks up from his prone position
a vision from hell approaches a fiendish blue skinned woman in a sodden nightgown
blood leaking from one wrist
she has risen reborn from the icy waters
she shoots him in the other knee
she tosses it aside
in a nearby crate assault rifles
snatches up a kalashnikov and clip
kneels and says you see in the movies badguy says talk to me and ill let you live
were gonna run a variation it goes like this talk to me
ill let you die
she fires again
the detective lies naked bound hand and foot
a single ray of light through a tiny crack
he hears a splintering noise as if a doors been ripped from its hinges
pause a fusillade of gunfire
a heavy weight slams to the floorboards above him
through a crack comes a tiny stream of blood dribbling onto him as timothy bolts from the house clutching a bleeding hand
running hellbent for leather
reaches a parked car
leaps in and kicks over the engine as behind him more men come piling out of the house shouting
running for their cars never make it
cut down in their tracks
wracked by gunfire bodies twitching
and as timothy peels out spraying mud we pull up up and away
into the sky moving ever higher gunfire fading
until now were way up we can see timothys car
the old mill ever so tiny below us
it blows to pieces
sends flaming boards flying straight up the door bursts open as perkins stalks in shedding his coat
his aide lets call him harry looks up nervously
this cant happen harry
the presidents already up at night prowling his sock drawer for double agents and now weve got a fucking rogue on our hands
sir theres someone in the conference room to see you
oh for the love of christ who can be so fucking important
he throws open a door off the passage theres timothy
perched on the edge of a conference table tamping a pack of smokes
perkins reacts stunned
its me your poor black cousin
the one you cant be seen with
are you crazy coming here
lights a cigarette my boss is dead
your rogue bitch just took him out
probably went shopping in his weapons storage too
he blows smoke
trains his eyes on the older man
were still on perkins
ive got the tanker the chemist all ready to go
but you gotta contain her man
we gotta step on her hard and fast
an agent on the switchboard calls out you have a call on line three sir
who is it
charly baltimore sir
perkins stops dead
lunges for the phone nearly drops it perkins
we only see her mouth
set in hard grim lines
she says its cold i want to come in
oh my god what the hell are you doing

ill come in for a full debriefing but we do it my way

if you want me dead youll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets
we do things my way
your way i see
and if i say go to hell
from where i stand it aint much of a commute

she clicks off
perkins darts a look at the techie guy shakes his head no go on the trace
she mustnt threaten our success
contain her whatever it takes
but be careful
if it gets out youre working for me
well both be grabbing our ankles on the white house lawn
thank you new jersey thatll be all
you can go now
waking is slow for mitch henessey
he swallows dryly
eyes creak open struggle to focus
hears water running
squints at his watch
hes not wearing a watch he knew that
in bed naked
chest swathed in bandages what the hell
he pokes them
jerks his head hissing in pain
henessey lights a smoke at the bar
flicks the match in a trashcan
starts to go stops
reaches into the can
plucks out a tiny scrap photograph ripped in two
a photo of hal and caitlin
he pockets it disturbed
crosses to the bathroom door
the shower has stopped
raises a tentative hand starts to knock
there in a thin silk robe is a woman swabbing at her hair
she breezes out of the bathroom all chipper like nothings unusual
notices henessey cursorily
raises a finger one sec
lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier spraying him
he cannot stop staring
its samantha it has to be
now shes blonde though
hair clipped short
blood red fingernails
red cotton shift legs for days
then she smiles at him and its not her not samantha
amnesias over folks because were clearly looking at a changed woman this ones name is charly baltimore and she hasnt seen the light of day in eight years
glad youre awake
uh oh youre seeping
she grabs a washcloth
frowns says here look at this
with that she opens her robe and exposes her breasts
henessey perks up considerably then screams as she rips the gauze from his chest
she clinchs the robe again
ah that hurt like shit
thats why i distracted you first
dabs at his wounds same principle as breaking in virgins
same as virgins what
saw it in a harold robbins book
guy bites her on the ear as he goes in
distracts from the pain
you ever try that
no i slug em in the jaw and yell pop goes the weasel what the fuck are you talking about
who are you
nice to meetcha
henessey watches fascinated
all the little mannerisms the differences
shaking out a match running a hand through her hair
and never missing a thing eyes constantly roving scanning
guard never down
she plucks a drink from a nearby table steals it outright
sit next to the dance floor every drinks free
people finish dancing they think the waiter lifted em
clears his throat says im confused
gimme a minute
take two theyre small
she knocks back her drink
henessey shifts uncomfortably lights a smoke
lets say i buy it
youre actually a trained killer jesus i cant even say it with a straight face
frowns so then
never really existed
like nathan said she was a total fabrication i made her up
and now shes just
forever and ever
look at my inordinately large ass look what she did to me
henessey squirms this ones gonna take some time to digest
pretty convincing act
i mean her personality it had to come from somewhere change the subject
better yet steal me another drink
next to him a couple get up to dance
he reaches over and lifts their beers
i called chapter
im trying to bring us in from the field alive
can you trust them
until i know you might wanna stay away from curbs
he looks at her confused they like to push people in front of buses
didnt need to know that
a dancing santa goes by bad caribbean accent hey lady santa want to dance the lambada witchoo
come this way everybody
he shimmies away
charly grins at henessey if i could come that way i wouldnt need to dance the lambada
follow me i need you to do something
henessey hunches forward speaks rapidly into the phone the ladys whacked trin shes lost it and i want fucking out now call the feds
shes moving us tonight ill sneak out to this phone call you back at midnight with the details
he hangs up quickly
turns reveal charly lounging a foot away watching him
all right charly
what did that accomplish
im testing our boy perkins
i figure hes gotta be tapping your office
got a light
pause then oh no
he just traced that call
she swipes matches from his pocket
come midnight you hang by the phone
nobody shows we think about trusting him
he tries to kidnap and torture you well there it is
whoa time out
oh dont be such a baby
lights her cigarette ten oclock we got two hours to kill
im a woman feed me
carnival rides dead for the winter
henessey and charly stroll beneath them
she eats chinese
god im full im gonna have a food baby
he takes a good long look at her still cant fathom it
beat shame about the fat ass
i bet you were really attractive once
oh i was
check this out
a guy said hed fuck me
swear to god
did he make good
oh and afterwards
oh my god afterwards i said the most funny thing you know what i said
beat i said go back to your room
she laughs through a swig of beer
memory flash charlys bedroom as dad puts the gun to his head and fires crack
its why he thought i had him killed
henessey huddles watching her closely
your father was murdered
she nods gazes out over the icy waters
speaks her voice faraway and gone when da died i went to his funeral
years old today i wouldnt
and i overheard a woman she was praying
she was thanking god sounded so happy thanking him it hadnt been her father who was killed
she didnt really care that god had let someone die
just so long as it missed her
beat and she bought her cross at the same store as mine see thats what we do we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls and
sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed
anger flares in her eye
like a stirring of mud at the bottom of a deep deep pond
fuck the waiting
fuck being afraid
i determine who gets hit and how hard
and i thank no one
its pathetic to thank someone who spares you when theyre just taking someone else
beat walk me upstairs
they enter the suite
she drops her purse sways toward him
presses him against the wall framed there in the doorway
this is my first date in eight years mitch
is this a fun date
quite suddenly charly leans over and kisses him on the lips
he reacts startled
stares at her
okay whats going on
true love shut the fuck up
you kidding me
im an ex con lady
i wear a shiny suit my ties crooked and the last time i got blown candy bars cost a nickel
plus im ugly so whats up
she nibbles his ear
pulls back smiling and henesseys holding the picture of hal and caitlin
the one he found torn in two
he looks her full in the face chemistry my ass

i think this is why youd fuck me
beat to kill a schoolteacher
bury any trace of her
he pushes her away
sorry i liked the schoolteacher
when she comes back give me a call
charly jerks backward
henessey heads for the bathroom
oh and call your fuckin kid will ya
its two days to christmas and shes under the mistaken impression that mommy gives a shit
charly snatches up her purse eyes burning i didnt ask for the kid mitch
samantha had the kid not me nobody she storms out
cut to charly stalks the city streets
a quartet sings god rest ye merry ostensibly about joy oddly the most depressing tune ever written
on a crowded street she is alone
searches her own haggard features in a shop window
swallows hard whispers easy baby
she aint coming back no way
bitch is dead
she bustles down a sidestreet hands jammed in her pockets
thats when a tall bearded man crosses the street and falls in alongside
i see me a good looking lady all upset i wonder if she doesnt need some male company
im saving myself til i get raped
his hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed
step into the alley honey
i aint asking im telling
charly stops walking
regards him the way you or i might look at a telephone cord
groans oh dont tell me
youre early goddammit youre supposed to be at the pay phone
go away and come back at midnight
im not ready yet
got a light
the guy stares mouth working
lady i have a gun
which is precisely when a much larger smith and wesson cocks next to his ear this aint no ham on rye pal
henessey holds the gun rock steady in his big fist
charly spins on him eyes flashing what the hell are you doing here
saving your life
woulda got here sooner but i was thinking up the sandwich line
you think i couldnt take him
idiot you probably scared the other guy away what other guy
headhunters nimrod they go in pairs were you always this stupid or did you take lessons
the hitman watches bewildered
considers waving to get their attention
finally he cant stand it
blurts out hey
charly snaps her head toward him what
i still got this fucking gun
she smiles sweetly
no you dont
takes it off him
just like that
he stares dumbly at his empty hand
half of his trigger finger is missing
charly flips the gun into the air
launches a spin kick
shatters his jaw
catapults him backwards
completes her spin catlike catches the
on its way down
doesnt stop there
arm out gun cocked fires
straight at henessey what
he dives aside behind him a second hitman
blown to tatters
the knife meant for henessey arcs through the air
imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective
he stares at it with shocked eyes
the killer hits dead
lowers her arm slowly
gun barrel smoking
just fuck all of you
a bronco roars up out of a parking garage
swerves and plunges into the maze of streets that inspired the worlds most popular board game
charly drives possessed
i knew i couldnt trust that prick
she throws a shrieking skid
henessey clutches for the dashboard swearing
i got myself out of beirut once i think i can get us out of new jersey
dont be so sure others have tried
the entire population in fact
beat look about me
i mean whats up youre this hot survival chick im getting the feeling you dont need me anymore
charly reaches over
yanks the doorhandle
she kicks him out of the moving car
he bounces off the highway
over and over shudders to a stop
the wind blows
looks up spits gravel
dusts himself off
watches the bronco go far away
as henessey trudges wearily down the highway we hear dear mom i was tortured now im in atlantic city
the girl of my dreams just threw me out of a speeding car
now more people will come an shoot me in the head
on the plus side i won two bucks at video poker
a screech of tires he turns startled here comes the bronco
skids onto the highway and races back toward him
pulls up alongside
charly throws open the door says get in
without a word
closes the door they drive off
he lights a cigarette like nothing happened
shakes out the match speaks without looking at her found a use for me
beat i gotta vanish mitch
i need money a whole bunch
why didnt you say so
gimme a second while i pull it out of my ass
she turns to him a gleam in her eye
speaks softly the key mitch
the one i keep around my neck
what about it
what if i told you its the key to box at pittsburgh international airport
how would you know
someone filed off the numbers
i filed them off
beat theres a briefcase in box mitch
whats in it
henessey does a spit take sprays whiskey
payment for my last assignment
i need you to retrieve it for me
dont be stupid they might have the place covered
i dont want to get shot to pieces
sighs gimme the key
id love to
i left it with caitlin back in ohio
the bronco races on into the night
late very late now
beside him charly reclines lost in reverie
features bathed in passing roadlights
henessey grinds out a butt humor me youre a paid assassin then you fall off a cliff
sink under the ocean and when you come out youre a fucking schoolmarm wanna tell me what happened
i fell into a school of fish they elected me principal
shut the fuck up
im thinking maybe samantha caine wasnt an act
maybe you forgot to hate yourself for eight years ever think of that
nope seems clear enough to me
hate myself christ almighty
what are you my shrink
no just some loser thought he could maybe understand fuck it

mary by the way
i pushed for cindy but hell
god im tired
beat i never did one thing right you know it not one fucking thing
not even accidental that takes skill
he looks over
shes asleep hasnt heard a word
face slack lips slightly parted
the toughness banished from her features
in its place a lingering sadness
cut to the bronco glides along
charly in the passenger seat eyes roving like a hawks
the caine house is peaceful and quiet
christmas lights still burning dimly
drive past dont slow down
points park under those trees honk if theres trouble
bad rochester yas massah i be slowin de caw down fo you
she stuffs a
automatic in her waistband
cradles an mp beneath her coat
rolls out of the still moving truck
makes her way through back yards
silent as a cat
she went to cookouts here
now she prowls a grim assassin
leaps a fence drops behind a woodpile comes face to face with raymond a fifth grade student we saw earlier
secreted behind the woodpile smoking
his eyes pop as he spies good ol ms
caine sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon
charly doesnt miss a beat good morning raymond
what did we learn about the dangers of smoking
give it here
a wet stain appears at his crotch
he hands her the cigarette with nerveless fingers
charly accepts it
takes a long satisfying drag
passes it back
tell anyone you saw me ill blow your fucking head off
moves off through the bushes
out of sight
charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates
crouches face pressed to the glass door
the house is silent and empty
the christmas tree winks off and on
the tree she helped decorate
she opens the door and slips inside
cut to three government agents
faces drawn haggard
pit stained shirts day old sandwiches
carrying photographs of charly and henessey
agent sighs examining her figure
man id eat a mile of her shit just to follow it back to the ass it came from
christ im trying to have breakfast
a radio mic on the dash squawks a voice says unit to red dog give us one more pass lets make sure the house is secure
begins to systematically rifle the drawers
her daughters precious things
sweeps everything onto the floor
utter disregard its a bit startling
crosses to the bed throws back the covers mr
perkins the stuffed bear has the chain around his neck
we hear it then
ghosting on the still air barely audible the sound of singing
childrens voices waft across the frozen pond from st
pauls episcopal church
crosses to the window lifts the sash
charly chews her lip
unlimbers the mp
hefts the wicked looking thing
not to fire it
but to use the scope
sights down the weapon
scans though the gunsights
pov charly hals christmas pageant
cast in spectral green
laughing and serving breakfast
on the church lawn a nativity scene
teenage girls as the wise men
choir of children singing
caitlin among them
charly is sweating
she lowers the scope
squeezes her eyes shut
something in her threatening to wrench loose
henessey slouched behind the wheel
starts to light a cigarette
stops the match halfway to his face
eyes riveted on the rearview mirror as a government sedan turns the corner behind him
watching her family far away
thats when she hears a horn honking
her head whips around toward the front of the house
the honk is followed by three gunshots in rapid succession
shes up and moving
all else forgotten
henessey peels out tires smoking
careens forward government sedan close behind the upstairs window explodes outward
charly hurtles through
freefalls to the porch roof
glass showering down
surfaces in a combat crouch fires
government sedan kills the passenger
collapses him over the doorframe
gun clatters to the street car speeds off the driver looks over incredulous
goddammit how did that happen
go bulletproof now
the driver hits a button and up go the windows
all that is except the passenger side window because the dead guys bald head blocks it
becomes wedged there
bald pate exposed to the world
charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the street
out of range
lowers the smoking
takes off around the house at a dead run
switch scenery the christmas pageant caitlin and fellow angels traipse into the church vestibule
caitlin looks up just in time to see timothy apply the chloroform
two seconds shes out like a light
up and moving child tucked neatly under his arm
a nearby mother of three has seen it happen
opens her mouth to scream he palms a knife
puts it to her youngest sons kidney wanna be a statistic lady
youre about to have
i know where you live
close your mouth you look like a fish
he exits into the vestibule
high speed chase in progress
the driver dogs henessey jockeys for position
barks into a radio mic target two acquired
red dog in pursuit backup requested
over his shoulder you got him
i got him
the backseat agent hefts an ak assault rifle
henessey checks the rear view mirror just in time to see a circular portion of glass pop from the chase cars window
out comes a gun muzzle
the guy opens up on full auto
rakes the bronco strafes it
henessey swerves madly no go
hes not coming home not this time
charly baltimore hurtles forward speed skating across the frozen pond toward the chase vehicles
long coltish legs to die for
this is gross this is gonna be so goddamn gross
she goes sideslipping at superhuman speed
tacks alongside the government sedan
targets the bald guys head
not to be graphic but the cars driver receives the bulk of the mess
across the eyes
he loses control skids out
catapults off the road onto the ice
slides right toward charly still doing fifty
she doesnt miss a beat
launches herself twisting in midair
up over the hood of the sedan it blows by underneath her as the incredible part
in slow motion she does a double axel pirhouette
above the hood
mid spin she blows three shots through the windshield
the car spins twice around
plows to a halt charly hits a picture perfect landing
on the shore henessey watches thunderstruck
charly skates by the icebound sedan
flashes a grin at the dying driver shit
i dont believe it they moved you from cyphers
long time man i figured you were dead by now
she delivers a blow to the neck
cut to henessey and charly driving a new vehicle late model cadillac
henessey rifles the glove compartment
still think im warm and fuzzy
its not your fault the gun accidentally went off in mid air as you tripped and flew over the car
whats in the glove box
phone bill christmas card
five buck swell
you didnt have to kill him you know
back off man
do i tell you how to snap photos of extramarital blowjobs
there is a short chirping sound
seemingly from nowhere
they exchange puzzled looks what the hell
charly abruptly realizes its coming from her purse
she reaches in scoops up the cellular phone the one she told caitlin to call
thumbs the button
says cautiously hello
a voice then
clipped tones timothys voice its me i got your kid
give your location we gotta lose the cellular
hand gripped tight on the phone
pause then state road minutes west of harrison
okay heres how we do it
drive to harrison find their main bus stop
pay phone fifteen minutes
better drive fast after five rings i hang up
what the hell was that
hes got the kid
doesnt want to talk on the airwaves hes routing me to a land line
a pay phone
the detectives mind racing
suddenly it hits him shit
they list em on the back of phone bills right
shut up and find me a gun
as he rips open the bill we cut to a neutral background as charlys head enters frame were very tight on her face
tense thin lipped
a phone rings deafening
click charly speaks tersely verify you have her
i got your cellular number off a cast on her right wrist
right below mommy loves you
picture of a panda

ill blind the kid and shoot out her knees
youre dead motherfucker
we dont involve families
its not the way its done we dont take families
ill be in touch
he hangs up
hold on charlys face
until slowly ever so slowly the camera pulls back to reveal the
automatic pointed at the head of an at t operator
the phone company theyve taken it over
employees cringe on the floor
henessey mp slung on his shoulder leveled
charly points to the switchboard give me an ani trace
set back from the mountain road a lonely motel
a neon sign deer lick motel no vacancies
the sign sits atop a rusty pole
timothy hangs up and turns to mr
perkins seated across the room its done she hooked
all i gotta do is set the ransom meet
she mustnt suspect a trap
she thinks im acting alone remember
say the word ill hand her to you on a plate
perkins crosses to the bed
rubs tired eyes
gazes down at caitlin
asleep a syringe on the nightstand beside her
next to a brown paper bag
were monsters arent we
pause then forget charly
talk to me about tonight
the tankers on its way from charleston eta a
one terrorist on ice waiting to play patsy
points whats in the sack
perkins follows his gaze the brown paper bag
something to prove that im not a complete ogre
he reaches into the paper bag and brings out a baby doll
frilly with lace
a bright red bow
the young one will have a doll to play with on christmas
very popular item
well it pees
you put water in it and
oh fuck you
charly and henessey eating at hardees
seated across from each other at an orange plastic table scarfing christmas burgers
outside a billboard reads welcome to santa claus
where its christmas all year long
almost dark now
another ten minutes

listen you sure were doing the right thing
weve got money we could negotiate
ill get the damn kid okay

so i let him seduce me
had a steel needle under the pillow figured to stick him en flagrante that means while we were screwing
but he was too slick
bashed me in the head finished then threw me in the trunk of a car
still think im a girl scout mitch
the look in her eyes is feral
its almost dark
lets get it done
full dark now the fun begins
a tanker truck rumbles up the mountain road
pulls up before the deer lick motel
men in suits wield flashlights motioning the truck forward into a cavernous garage
inside men in blue jumpsuits operate cranes maneuver a fill tank into place above the truck
in the distance as the tanker enters the garage charly baltimore drops into frame
lands and rolls cat quick
comes up behind a scrawny pine
scans through a pair of zeiss nightvision binoculars
welcome to the extraction
no more fun and games tonight its a survival zero operation
henessey appears at her elbow
lugging the ordnance bag
he sees charly lower the binoculars head in hands
whats the matter
fucking chapter thats who
timothy acting alone caitlin had a chance
shes dead meat
as the tanker snorts to a halt timothy pulls up driving a bright red jaguar
gets out as a blue suit trots up hours
were still trying to clean the tanker scowls annoyance fuck the cleaning just drain it and reload
chop chop im going bunjee jumping after this
charly and henessey
he speaks tersely let me go in
you stomp around like a forties drunk and youre a lousy shot
i get by
you couldnt hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom now shut the fuck up
charly studies the encampment
draws a long ragged breath and flops on the ground
props her back against a tree
lights a cigarette i saw a little girl
frowns come again
thats what happened under the water
that night eight years ago
she looks up at the sky
at the end
there she was this pretty little girl at the bottom of the ocean smiling at me
three years old didnt know daddies hid in closets not yet
stared up at me in the strangest way
saying howd it come to this we were so pretty and perfect now look at us sinking with our head all open
said when she grew up she was gonna teach school
she couldnt wait
she heaves a sigh
threads a silencer on a baretta
guards are on megahertz meet me at you need to talk
as soon as you spot me with the kid start blowing the charges
pause she does something unexpected
leans over and kisses him hard on the lips
he reacts startled
she pulls back the oddest look on her face
theyre gonna blow my head off you know
softly this is the last time ill ever be pretty
she kisses him again
pulls back turns without a word
what i do next they tell me it
looks like a machine or something
you dont like it dont look
she moves off toward the trees
henessey shifts from foot to foot awkwardly
opens his mouth dont say it
i was gonna say enjoy life eat out more often
beat if shes alive shes coming out of there mitch
if shes not
theyll know we stopped by
shes gone like a wraith
cut to series of shots charly on the prowl
in and out of the trees
burying c charges
she crawls to woods edge peers out the motel stands solemn and bedraggled
draws a sharp breath
theres a lit candle in the window of
cut to a gray suited sentry
poised on a wooded slope
he puts a walkie talkie to his lips and says all clear
charly out of nowhere
hand clamped on mouth
in goes the knife
he burbles blood
before he hits charlys already switched from knife to gun and moved on
charly appears from the shadows
ghosts up to the window of and peers in
crosses to the door taps lightly
watches the peephole a tiny pinprick of light
abruptly darkened by a human eye she presses the silenced beretta to the hole and fires
sputs of splinters
from behind the door a muffled thud
she goes to work on the lock
henessey lies prone binoculars trained on the motel
christ lady what are you doing in there playing fucking mah jongg
behind him a tiny sharp click
timothy has a skorpion machine pistol aimed at his head
the killer speaks into a radio unit a single word bogey
go the kleig lights
brilliance blinding catches charly coming out of
pins her dead to rights
unconscious daughter cradled in her arms
tiny doll cradled in the kids
charly runs as the ground around her erupts like a timothy meanwhile shouting into his walkie talkie saying take her alive perkins wants her
henessey watches helpless and panicked as charly tumbles backward
crashes through a cellar access it splinters beneath her
plunges into blackness
she hits cushions the kid
grunt of pain
the darkness explodes into kaleidoscopic flashes of gunfire charly strafe it all
blows through the clip hits the lights shes killed household items
brick walls blasted
rusty tools faded signs three ten gallon gas cans which shes managed to perforate good one charly
the gas comes bubbling out on burps and splatters drenching the floor
charly casts about for an escape route
set into the brick wall a huge steel door
she flings it open meat locker
nothing there no help
a gravely voice wafts down from above then
deadly serious i smell gasoline you have a little accident
i got plenty of matches up here
bad way for a kid to go
thirty seconds think it over
charly stands in place mind racing
regards her dully
plastic smile like it knows a secret
cut to a match flares as it descends into the bowl of a pipe
perkins puffs mightily
turns and favors charly and henessey with a thoughtful gaze theyre handcuffed to radiator
timothy straddles a nearby chair
smiles and says good to have you back again chuck
you know colonel you ought really to have stayed dead
you dont know the rules of the game anymore
eight years ago you send me to kill daedalus and this clown
now youre working with him
he crosses to the fireplace flips the match inside
budget cuts remember
congress blinded us in eastern europe central america
across the board an intelligence blackout
we had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find even if it meant going to former targets
suddenly charlys eyes go wide
she whispers budget cuts
is that what this is about
the foot soldiers the tanker truck
fuck me youre running a fundraiser
she looks up in disbelief
youll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing wont you
all you need is a major terrorist incident
theory my ass
i think some terrorists were planning a strike
bought supplies from daedalus thats how you knew they were coming
eyes widening no way
dont tell me youre gonna sit there and let them go through with it just to get a budget increase
perkins shrugs philosophically
its not without precedent
remember the world trade center bombing
the cia had advance knowledge dont think they didnt
worse the diplomat who issued the terrorists visa was cia they facilitated the bombing
purely to justify a budget increase
of course theyd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job
thats not gonna happen this time
this time the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned
this time the terrorists cant muck it up
because weve killed them and taken over
charly and henessey react startled
on the move
our two heroes shepherded across the compound
timothys casualness is belied by the presence of two dyspeptic guards each keeping a safe distance
a pock faced agent approaches briskly rifle across his shoulder
holds out his hand found these buried around the perimeter
timothy studies it c charge with remote detonation unit
make sure you get all of them
the agent rushes off
timothy looks at charly reproachfully chuck you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me come back from the dead whack my boss
no sense lyin im miffed
moves like lightning
charly stumbles vision going black
fights for balance
henessey starts to react but a gun muzzle stops him
grits her teeth says so whats the plan
whats going out in the tanker
timothy and the guards exchange looks
cracking up they cant believe it charlys not laughing
looks at timothy with hooded lifeless eyes whats the plan
im gonna die i wanna know
timothy lights a cigarette
you wanna know the plan
he casually points to the neighboring valley where christmas lights twinkle
santa claus small town u
we drive the chemical tanker in tonight park it
add a catalyst chain reaction it goes hot
the mix heats overnight goes critical at degrees celsius
main street looks like a meteor strike
are you fucking insane
youre talking about people
to timothy how you gonna blame it on terrorists
those roads are treacherous this time of year
when we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine with the corpse of imn al rahman in it
get the picture
charly summons herself
her voice a dull rasp listen to me timothy
let my kid go
for old times sake
she shakes her head goddamn you look at her eyes
and why exactly should i do that
spits blood because theyre yours motherfucker
she stares timothy full in the face
that night in paris i got pregnant
the little girls your daughter
then timothy brays laughter
cant believe it
hooting out loud
he manages to bring himself under control
stops gestures to the cellar access the dark awaits
kids down there
what it is charly theyre gonna find you both frozen to death in the woods
charly fights to contain herself
shes no risk timothy let her go
the freezers downstairs charly
lets get it done
charly and henessey are separated at gunpoint
a look passes between them
henessey swallows hard
ill wait for you to rescue me
be just a minute
charly goes through the opening
the same cellar she occupied earlier
timothy behind her he wrinkles his nose in distaste
shit this place is loaded with fumes nobody light a fucking match
you check her for flammables
shrugs checked her for colon cancer
caitlin is sitting in a chair
bundled in flannel clutching her baby doll the one perkins bought for her
she looks up at charly dully
sucking her thumb
charly composes herself
mommys here its okay
safe and snug
what comes next huh
whats the next part
bug in a rug
man with white hair
says the same thing you say
charly licks her lips
easy charly keep cool she mustnt die afraid
were going to take a nap together cate
you can have your dolly and mommy will be next to you hows that
itll be like bears in winter
when they get cold see they fall deep deep asleep
bears yeah yeah
he points to the steel door of the meat freezer
the guard opens it onto a gleaming silver chamber
timothy calmly adjusts the thermostat
the guard reaches for caitlins doll
charly snatches it back
face etched in disgust
youre murdering us both cocksucker let the kid have her fucking dolly
he subsides unable to meet her gaze
at which point timothy tosses her the wooden box
chuck im not a total creep
ill make you a deal okay
theres a knife in that box
now you and the kid youre going to freeze but if you kill the kid by your own hand
i wont kill your husband
were gonna open that door and youll both be frozen solid but i wanna know that youve cut your own childs throat
you dont want to ever be on the receiving end of the look she gives him
steps into the freezer holding caitlin
as the door starts to swing shut she says it aint over motherfucker
youre gonna die screaming and im gonna watch
am i telling the truth
she flashes him her most dazzling smile the whole room lights up
she can do that
as the door erases her from view a chill dances up timothys spine
because there was nothing resembling doubt on her face
charly crosses with caitlin to the far corner
mom its cold in here
just for a little bit
polar bear remember
breaks open the box sure enough a hunting knife
without missing a beat she crosses to the steel door
kneels and begins digging at the bottom edge
carving into the brick what the hell
henessey by the window
tied to a chair
timothy paces before him carrying three razor keen scalpels
pegs one into the wall with deadly accuracy
tell me where charly keeps her money
she must have mentioned it
get fucked you dumb bastard
charly called washington by morning this whole placell be crawling with feds
well be gone by then mitch
yeah well thats what im saying theres a couple feds they couldnt sleep said they might come early
fuck you someonell screw up
already did mitch someone already did
perkins got stuck with a double agent someone trusted highly placed
chuckles chinks are paying me to bring down chapter
henessey reacts startled
timothy chuckles truck goes hundreds dead rescue teams within minutes guess what they find
they find chapter caught with their pants down
see mitch i dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst
beat the tankers gonna blow tonight
in the center of town thirty five minutes from now
charly sweating at sub zero
brushes hair from her eyes
still jabbing with the knife why the hell is she digging
gonna crawl under the damn door
shes gone loopy
lying flat she appraises her work a tiny notch
poked through to the other side
the actual penetration to daylight millimeters
then she does two seemingly nonsensical things crosses to caitlin gently takes the doll from her then open
reaches in her mouth
takes out her retainer
must be the temperature
crosses to the door again
calmly with infinite care takes the retainer
inverts it now its trough shaped
holds it flush against the tiny notch she carved
baby doll now
holds it directly above the retainer
depresses the knob in its back it pees gasoline
gas trickling down the retainer through the brick into the other room
draws a trail with the doll
crosses dribbling over to caitlin
hands the doll back to her
she grabs the hunting knife thats what
raises it high one terrifying moment is she gonna put it in the kid
brings it down on the floor
slams it down
gimme a spark
show me show me
striking over and over
floor rings with the effort come on come on
but in the end its just not gonna happen
lets go a groan of despair all this just one fucking match goddamit
she collapses forward
cradles her head in frustration
theres a tiny tap in her shoulder
charly looks up face haggard and depleted
caitlins eyes alive again
no longer dulled
kid reaches inside her cast and brings out a pack of matches
i keep these here
beat for lighting your candle
charly stares dumbstruck at the tiny gift
the bitterness the self hatred all of it
under innocent eyes on christmas eve detonates blown sky high and she sweeps up her daughter and cradles her tears streaming
i love you caitlin oh god do you know how much i love you
caitlin pulls back looks flush in her mothers face
am i gonna die
from a dark and cold place caitlin has led her home
charlys eyes like steel
a harsh whisper no baby youre not gonna die
she strikes a match
henessey straining against his bonds
whats the number of the locker mitch
timothy across the room a good forty feet
left nut five bucks i make it
smiling he raises a scalpel
eyes dead like a rats
the flame hovers above the gasoline trail
when i tell you scream as loud as you can or else your earsll get hurt
a tiny nod
charly calmly touches fire to the fuel
cradles caitlin to her chest gently strokes her hair
hey should we buy a dog
the flame races across the room
hits the steel door
vanishes through the notch
wooden walls obliterated
the meat locker door blows inward like a cannon shot
holds to its hinges buckled like jiffy pop
timothys throw is off target sticks in henesseys chair
between his legs
then the assassin leaves his feet look of comic surprise as the walls behind him disintegrate in flame
henessey cries out blinded as hes blown backward out the window
chair and all lofting across the middle distance
blasts through the motel sign
blows it to splinters
tumbles and over end
atop the garages corrugated roof
chair flies to sticks
a blue suit spins startled
gun comes up henessey doesnt miss a beat
reaches between his legs
plucks the knife from the wood and slings it
guy takes it in the head drops
some days you get lucky
he looks up in disbelief
fireball raging to heaven
you foxy bitch
timothy staggers from the smoke
nicked and bloodied alive
rushes into the cavernous garage where blue suits scuttle like ants
points to the tanker face crazed move it out of here now
caitlin in tow smoke everywhere
running flat out across the compound
eyes ticking back and forth missing nothing
sees a gun on the ground scoops it up promptly drops it the fucking things red hot
thats when the pock faced killer lurches out of the smoke blade arcing for her throat
she goes under the blade
down they go hit the dirt caitlin beats feet vanishes into the smoke
charly fighting for her life
manages to kick free
he rears up
poised to hurl the knife
charly dives rolls scoops up the gun and screams as her flesh sizzles and it spurts three times and blows him down
rips the automatic rifle from his shoulder
rummages in his coat cube of c
casts about searching the smoke
no sign of her daughter
caitlin darts in and out of the trees
in the background men rush back and forth
the motel burns merrily
then above the shouts a rumbling noise she darts a look as the tanker comes trundling out of the garage
pov caitlin attached to the rear of the truck bed a bright yellow utility box roughly three by three
as the driver idles waiting for the road to clear caitlin breaks cover
runs and climbs inside the box and meanwhile her mother
crouched behind timothys red jaguar
scans through the rifles starlight scope
we see the landscape cast in ghostly green
whered you go baby
charly watches through the scope as a tiny green caitlin climbs into the box and shuts the lid
unfortunately a nearby blue suit has witnessed this
he looks around stabbing a finger at the box hey
hey you see that
a little kid a bullet slams him backward in a cut string sprawl
she lowers the rifle
nods grimly smart girl honey
dont make a sound
snug as a bug in a rug
henessey on the move
choking on woodsmoke eyes streaming
up ahead a splayed corpse he hunkers over the poor schmuck guys good for a radio
snatches up the portable unit
fumbles with the dial searching for
charly slews to a stop in the red jag
darts along the cliff throws herself flat
peering down at the grounds sniper rifle positioned babysitting the tanker
calling to her on the radio
charly you there
grabs the unit from her belt mitch
i dont believe it
listen if you say are we having fun yet ill rip your nuts off
where are you
behind the big garage
is caitlin with you
no but shes safe for the moment she stowed away on the tanker truck
henessey draws a sharp breath
swallows says charly timothy rigged the tanker to go off early
we got fifteen minutes
on her reaction we cut to beside the tanker a panel truck sits engine idling
phony logo on its side little debbie snack cakes
a ramp is lowered and a car begins backing up into the truckbed facing outwards
inside the truckbed harried blue suits hurriedly unwrap the frost covered corpse of imn al rahman and place him behind the wheel
a blue suit puts a padlock on the utility box as he passes
he hears two flat crack
s on the still air
even over the receiver her desperations apparent tires wont pop mitch
bastard just locked her in shes stuck in there and theyre leaving goddammit
henessey rubs his eyes
takes several deeps breaths mind turning it over
he looks up
all right ill go in and get her you watch my back
i make it twelve mitch automatic weapons
so kill em for me bitch christ what are you good for
he stuffs a fresh clip in the gun
wipes away sweat
to himself cmon buddy
do one thing right just this once
closes his eyes
piece of cake
he leaps from the roof and makes a death run
gun in one hand radio in the other
swerving and dodging like a broken field runner charly in his ear screaming your nine on your nine
he spins blasts away dead guy pitching forward smoke billowing making him cough
degrees left mitch
beat your other left
stumbling catching himself
nix nix i cant see in there dont do it break right
he breaks right
fuck me i was wrong get outta threre
he staggers out of the smoke two men mp machine guns
trained on his chest
he struggles to aim oh shit two distant cracks
the bad men go away catapulted backwards
henessey shouts into the radio gracias
charly fires shot after shot
every time she squeezes the trigger someone dies
no such thing as wounded were talking st
peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit its the lunch rush at kate mantilinis
the smoke clears and mitch sees the tanker
right there thirty yards away
yellow utility box
no one in the way
end run mitch go wide
he breaks for the truck
no goddamn you they got you flanked
everybody fires a gun
takes one high in the chest spins him
charly sprays on full auto dices to tatters the combat zone extinguishing the gunmen too little too late because bam
bullet takes out his right arm fuck you buddy doesnt miss a beat simply tosses the gun over to the other hand and keeps shooting blows that fucker down and
now hes staggering into the trees and collapses and hits
and lies very still and bleeds
as echoes of gunfire die slowly we hear dear ma im looking at the ants theyre pretty great
some really funny ants here ma
all these funny ants think ill stay and watch em awhile
charlys out of ammo
flings aside the rifle snarling in a helpless rage something else then
building in pitch reaching a crescendo crests the cliff and hovers like the sword of damocles
marksman riding shotgun
scans the cliff below thick evergreens
charly somewhere among them
he sights down his rifle takes careful aim blows out tires on the jaguar
the chopper banks heading away
in big trouble
many headlights bouncing uphill toward her
cut off theyve cut her off the other direction aint much better a foot drop
evergreen trees far below
she hears the phone ringing then
inside the jag
reaches in lifts the receiver
i tried to give you a pretty death baby
did my best
now youre fucked now its ground beef time
how long til it blows
incredulous sweet loretta youre another animal entirely
lets see degrees
make it ten minutes give or take
then i better hurry
oh spare me
you made a big noise and bought five more minutes on the planet
ill spit in whats left of your face
he clicks off
charly drops the receiver
turns looks behind theyre coming for her
woods filled with headlights
ducking in and out of the trees getting closer
the wind blows
bitter cold out here in the dark night of the soul
the rage explodes in the form of a kick which shatters the lock on the trunk
dammit she needs a fucking miracle
at that moment the trunk lid slowly rises creaking
revealing all of timothys bunjee jumping equipment
the tanker is rolling
out onto the road snorting and belching
preceded by the little debbie panel truck
poor little caitlin huddles in the dark
roaring in her ears
sort of like being underwater
a silver device attached to the skin of the tank
he consults a tiny liquid crystal display on his watch
she wont quit
busy now deftly sticking the wad of c explosive to the bottom of the jaguar
turns around stands dead calm as they all come out of the trees guns drawn
raises her hands see boys
no bang bang
like backlit monsters they approach hulking
matter of yards now
she flashes a naughty little smile goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward
feet of open air the bunjee cord pays out fast
whipsaws out the door of the jaguar hooked by carabiner to the steering column and meanwhile rush forward incredulous
peer over the edge below them a swan diver blackness all around
she drops like a stone
vanishes into the fog beautiful as a poem
inside the jaguar the cord goes taut now it starts to stretch outward
deceleration kicking in charly can feel it still whistling through space
hits a dead stop
this is it
cord stretched as far as it goes
shes still sixty feet above the highway
no hesitation whatsoever
she thumbs the detonator in her right fist blows the car
the jaguar goes up with a solid crump
blown off the edge of the cliff
along with a half dozen screaming agents
feet above the road no problem
she does thirty feet in freefall
raises her left hand slaps a carabiner on a passing power line
hurtles downward until suddenly ka chuk
she lurches to a stop
doesnt miss a beat grips a rope and glides the last thirty feet touches down lightly
unhooks herself turns as an oncoming car throws a fishtail skid just misses her
driver she raises her gun
fires without blinking
puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the driver aint sticking around hes out the door and gone as crosses to the car face a stone mask
behind her the flaming jaguar smashes to the ground raining fragments followed by burning corpses smacking the pavement one after another
she doesnt even look
gets behind the wheel
leaves most of her tires on the road behind her
music and laughter
santa heads up a teeming parade down main street atop a horse drawn sleigh
replay of the films opening as the gleaming tanker roars down a sidestreet
riding point the innocuous panel truck
the temperature gauge continues to rise degrees
charly runs a roadblock doing fifty someone put a parade in front of her
hits the brakes
fishtales into a mailbox
sends it flying through a plate glass window
out of the car gun held low and meanwhile timothy barks orders into a mic all units converge
divert local law this is a government matter
brook no interference i want the baltimore woman eliminated
wheres the fucking chopper
racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile santa claus himself perches atop his sleigh feeling like a rock star and wishing his groupies were legal
when suddenly hes got company
im the missus
the rogue colonel fires a shot in the air the horses bolt
plunging off the parade route amid screams as mr
perkins hunkers forward face slack as a tinny voice issues from his headset mic yes shes with santa claus correct er excuse me the individual playing santa er
theyre pursuing the tanker truck sir
perkins stares straight ahead speechless
side by side with the tanker
horses at full gallop hooves in pounding frenzy
charly tries to jump from one to the other no go the tanker pulls away widening the distance and meanwhile come whipping out of alleys fall in behind them
gunshots shattering the stillness
a ricochet whines off a hydraulic cable
spurt of fluid as the brakes start to go and meanwhile charly throws herself flat next to santa
government agents high level conspiracy
the sedans jockey for position try to pull abreast charly swerves the sleigh back and forth wont let them through
she hands the reigns to santa
away from the truck
in five seconds im gonna own that fucking truck
peels off to the left opens a twelve foot chasm between sleigh and tanker
sure enough one of the government cars spurts forward to fill the gap comes abreast of them
its what she wanted
charly baltimore leaps from the sleigh lands atop the government car
skips lightly across it casually blows two shots through the roof
down through the metal
drilling into their heads
driver and passenger killed instantly as charly hops nimbly from her mile an hour stepping stone
over to the tanker
dump stuffs a new clip as fades from the race driverless
whipping out of control
fishtails away behind them takes out the second chase car spray of metal
three seconds and charlys taken out two pursuers
the door files open and the driver sees charly
wisely leaps out bounces from view charly snags his hat as he goes by plops it on her head
swings up into the drivers seat double clutches pours on the steam
she owns the tanker
blasts forward into the lead panel truck
slams the truck from behind bulldozes it sends it thundering into a park bench
she owns the road
on the seat beside her an mp machine gun
throws a ninety degree turn onto a sidestreet
donates most of her tires to new york
charlys on fire
eyes tick back and forth like a machine
heading downhill out of town
hang on catey
she hits the brakes
a flash of sparks
a ripping whine dies away the brake pedal is all play
shes in a runaway truck
no not fair not fucking fair
a lunging behemoth
cant stop catey cant
chain link fence at roads end
beyond it a quarter mile plunge
downhill over rocky terrain to st
looming stone structure
vast empty parking lot
tears on her cheeks
lights a cigarette
takes a long drag exhales suck my dick every one of you bastards
blows through the chain link fence
shudders and leaps downhill
mud blows skyward
trees blasted to splinters
buffeted inside the utility box
cries out as charly fights to contain the beast
fuck you slyly retorts the beast
she bounces and caroms off the sides like a mad pinball and all the windows blow out concussively and the front tires go with a volcano crack
as the beast goes canting to one side ponderous massive
it keels over on its side
still doing fifty
slows itself by taking out light poles shears them off like saplings
whacks the side of the chapel
charly is ejected from the cab
pinwheels through space like a broken doll bursts through a stained glass window
the glass ruptures as she catapults through
hits on her stomach bounces
slides to a stop rolls over flings herself aside just in time as a towering st
peter smashes to earth an inch from her head showers marble
concussion dies away
the tanker slides detonating planters one by one
comes to rest in a central courtyard
lies there a hissing dinosaur
timothys temperature gauge is still affixed to the trucks underbelly degrees
charly semi conscious
rolls onto her back gasping
stares at the gathered saints
sucking it up preparing
rolls to one knee plants her foot
shes got to make that truck
on her feet now
one arm hugging her guts
cross eyed so hard to focus
left foot right foot get it done bitch yes its supposed to hurt that much flings open the door and shes so brave that for a second we think she
might make it
timothy kicks her in the head
charly flies back
hits and slides
fetches up against a bannister wham
timothy calmly shuts the door behind him
consults his tiny gauge degrees
call it four minutes to detonation
i got a chopper on the way lots of time
he sheds his coat
stows his gun
removes a switchblade
drapes the coat on the bannister
flicks open the knife
only four inches
youll feel me
he approaches almost casually
charly staggers erect
adopts a killing stance
she can barely stand
perkins hears a garbled pained voice over his headset point team leader reporting
incapacitated the truck
im damaged sir i believe im dying
he leans back
loosens his tie hits the intercom and says anthony get me the president
he takes out a bottle of scotch
cut to charly and timothy
they circle two pros
youve lost a step chuck
muscles never recovered from c section ill bet
am i right
never watching the eyes the eyes are liars they watch the hands
the gathered saints look on neutral
shes a beautiful little girl
his concentration never falters as he says shes a worthless bitch
i know it cause she came out of me
he lunges with the knife she spins away he gets hold of one arm and flings her up and over
she sails through space
twists in mid air
lands like a cat
its called shock charly
your body wants to go into shock
fuck you your breathings lousy
charly launches herself
avoids a stab at her throat eats that for breakfast spins slams the knuckles of her right hand into timothys ribs
he snarls traps her wrist crack
she hisses in pain falls back circling again
charly cannot walk a straight line
look at you
youre out of your motherfucking league dearie
she looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red and in those eyes we glimpse it the demon laughing
as charly whispers you want a piece
take my shoulder
he lunges with the knife
she ducks trips on purpose and hands him her shoulder all thats missing is the plate and wham
in goes the knife cuts deep and charly looks him in the eye and grins because sure enough theres the bastards knee wide open
boot strikes bam
shears the knee and timothy howls in agony
stumbles backward into the bannister grabs his coat
brings out the gun it goes off
charly dives for cover
rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it
takes him in the shoulder
topples him back
up and over flailing
drops from sight
charly falls back
sits down hard
looks down at herself oh god
theres a hole in her chest
the doors burst open and here she comes
shock blood loss she makes for the tanker
for her kid
going on sheer guts
the pilot brandishes his radio mic got her
heading for the tanker thirty yards out
shes all over the place somethings wrong with her
left foot right foot shes not running shes falling in a straight line reaches the tanker
staggers against the inverted chassis
cover your ears
she raises her gun
lock springs to pieces
caitlin tumbles to the pavement dazed and confused
casts about she springs to her feet
comes running and flings both arms around her mother
hugs her that one puts charly out for a few seconds
comes to her senses swaying like a clothesline in a high wind
dont go away again please
charly grabs caitlins head
facing the temperature gauge
red numerals degrees
the trucks a bomb
gonna blow up run
im right behind you go
caitlin hovers torn
charly summons a gutteral croak go and dont look back
in the end caitlin relents
runs toward the surrounding woods
charly watches her go
nods satisfied collapses
hits the tarmac and splays in a heap
breath wheezing in and out
already the pavement is staining red
as within ten seconds of the command she promptly disobeys her mother looks back stops dead
theres a corpse underneath the truck
it isnt moving
it isnt breathing
it isnt laughing or crying
or hurting not anymore
her tiny arms pumping feet slapping pavement she returns to her mother
grabs one knife bloodied shoulder oblivious of the wound
jerks back and forth
im sorry i left please wake up come on please
cheek against the pavement
one lifeless eye stares
bloodshot and sightless
government vehicles pulling up now
at the edge of the parking lot
yards away give or take
the little debbie panel truck
agents crouch behind cars
weapons trained on the wounded behemoth
the side door bursts outward and a limping figure emerges frantically signaling for the chopper timothys got murder in his eye
the chopper banks coming in low as he hauls himself aboard
sir your shoulder fuck the shoulder knees worse
just bring me around and hold her steady
im not leaving until i know the bitch is dead
he grabs an automatic rifle
she adheres to charlys motionless form
looking small and terrified
whispers in her mothers ear
soft and low mommy get up now
you just stop it mommy you stop being a little baby
stop it youre not dead i know youre not dead so you get up now
face contorted she strikes out
dont you die you get up now goddammit
life is pain you just get used to it and stand up right this minute mommy
life is pain do it you bitch
tears coursing in rivulets
little fists clenched
then it might be a trick of the wind
tiny aspiration not enough breath to fog a mirror
a solitary tear appears in the wide open staring eye
one fingernail then
a hand planting itself
teeth bared a rictus of pain
full height now flexing one deadly arm
she hugs her daughter and says youre grounded
overhead the howling of rotor blades
charly gasps for breath
cracks open the gun
scans the pavement
the mp machine gun lies twenty feet from her
twenty miles same difference
across the pavement even farther away timothys car
charly swallows hard im gonna get the gun you run for that car
we go on three okay
they break cover
into the open
a withering fire erupts
right at their feet
geysers of asphalt shot skyward timothy sprays the blacktop from above
charly goes insane
lurches crazed to the cab of the truck
thumbs the mike and says somebody get that motherfucker off me
i got a kid here i got my eight year old daughter jesus christ
its christmas eve who are you people fucking pull him off
do you hear me
eyes snap open in darkness
we dont know whose they are
we dont know where we are
the temperature gauge degrees
she clutches caitlin
shouting into the mic distract him for gods sake give me ten seconds please im begging somebody anybody shes my daughter
a sour looking chapter agent stands before a row of cars and the little debbie panel truck
lifts the mic to his lips and says negative maam we understand your request but weve decided to go ahead and let this play out
behind him the back of the panel truck explodes
a car catapults outward into space smashes down atop two sedans
blows out their windshields
flings itself to the pavement and ricochets forward zero to sixty
at the wheel
making a suicide run
face a fright mask of deadly purpose
we have no idea why someone who looks like him is alive
distraction just enough the pilot banks toward the car
where are you going
timothy grabs the stick thats when charly breaks cover
does a mad stagger across the blacktop
goes for the gun
timothy changes direction
chopper again screaming in low and fast charly dives rolls comes up with the machine gun and falls flat on her back points it skyward suck on it
blows the choppers tail rotor
the craft pitches to the side dumps timothy out the door
head over heels he falls lands atop the tanker right on the silver tank and burns
actually sizzles at degrees celsius steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight die screaming motherfucker
she watches as he slips from sight
off the tanker
sirens now approaching
wind biting cold
ground black and bloody in the moonlight
here comes henessey powers across the lot pedal to the metal
followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen squawling government vehicles flashers turning
henessey stomps the brake
slews to a stop tires cooking
kicks open the passenger door as charly collapses into the car caitlin in her arms
the kid says hurry
the truck is a bomb
what else we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof
no caitlin dont check
he peels out
i think thats yours
he inadvertently smacks a light pole
youre a bad driver
who said you could drive
they have to drag timothy inside the car
the engine roars as it leaps forward trailing the other five scarred and hideous he stares after charly screaming somebody do her somebody kill that fucking whore kill her
thats when the helicopter crashes
the pilot does everything but flap his arms forget it
it keels over
rotor touches pavement blows to pieces
they all go
blown like rockets in every direction
timothy looks up as a rotor blade whistles right through the windshield of his car
shears off his head
blows out the back in a shower of glass and hurtles onward spinning out of control
strikes the tanker
imagine god in monte carlo
tossing dice the length of a craps table
now imagine the dice are burning cars
henessey flies out of the parking lot and into the woods as the firestorm rages to heaven behind him
cars heading his way airborne
fights the wheel swerving through the woods as all around him flaming cars crash down
bouncing into and out of the trees peekaboo
some go flying past overhead
striking in front like meteors gouging the earth
caitlin screams dont hit the cars
henessey favors her with a foul look
charly looks up and sees angels flying overhead trailing concrete
then theyre out of the woods
car slingshots onto the highway and races forward safe
behind it the sky is aglow snowing fiery traces
bits of earth trees pavement
overhead view as they roar out of town we see burning woods and a crater approximately yards in diameter st
peters seminary no longer exists
cut to henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops
he lays his head on the steering wheel sucking air
looks at charly sorry cant drive
are you okay
grimaces are you
you arent going to die
charly offers him that soft sad little smile
henessey starts to fade
strokes caitlins hair
smiles at her hey gorgeous
you got your mothers eyes
nobody tell you different
slumps back in the seat
gazing at charly
a single tear runs from one bloodshot eye
he whispers scared
to be nobody
without a ripple
beat love you
charly leans on the dash
cries for awhile
for this godawful planet and everything else
dissolve to a mother sits in the glow of a winnie the pooh nightlight
next to her sleeping daughters bed back to the very beginning of the film its been a long kiss goodnight
an elderly farmer pokes his head in
she doesnt look up
ambulance is here
theyll be right in
the shadowy figure nods
stays awhile in the dark
snow slithers against the glass
perkins emerges from a guest cottage flanked by his aide harry
theyll push for dismantlement of our apparatus in chile but weve got a degree of plausible deniability
harrys foot comes down on a circular slab of stone and a voice from the grave says stay very still
stops him in his tracks stops him dead as charly baltimore steps from the nearby trees
stands twenty yards downrange
beretta leveled at both of them
two months you barely notice the limp
she stands there in sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million
thumbs a metal box click
a red arming light blinks on
good morning im charly
the slab youre standing on is actually a land mine
keep your foot on the pressure plate nothing happens
step off the stone well all be wearing you
perkins steps forward
the gun shifts
charly i know weve treated you poorly please it was just business she reaches in a pocket
tosses him a cellular phone he catches it as though it were a live snake
my terms are these
call state and order full disclosure on your personal correspondence
then disband chapter effective immediately
i wont shoot you and i wont make you stand on that mine
i wont touch you
i wont touch you
he swallows hard
looks to his aide
back to her
charly takes a deep breath
scans the flowers face placid
its really quite lovely today
maybe shell start a garden
perkins clicks off
look at charly its done
now you promise
you wont shoot me
wont make me get on the mine
shifts her aim and shoots the other guy
perkins eyes widen in sudden realization
he lunges forward grabs the aide holding him up
desperately propping his dead weight atop the land mine
goddamn you i cant hold him
you fucking bitch
henesseys chrysler convertible has been restored to a cherry red
it purrs along the boulevard charly at the wheel
she talks on the cellular phone yes mr
president you have my assurance that perkins latest operation has been rendered beyond salvage
behind her a gout of earth blows skyward
showers the road a ways back
hes not in the greatest shape either
he speaks from the oval office face grave i owe you an astounding debt of thanks colonel
would it be impertinent to ask if youd consider working for state again
the moneys involved would be substantial
out of the question
ive got a stack of papers to grade
listen before i go i need a small favor
henesseys ex wife stands in the open doorway flanked by her son todd
two uniformed cops speak solemnly as i say we can only apologize for the system maam but its confirmed that your husband is innocent of the crime for which he
this is a photograph of the actual criminal
he shows her a mug shot of timothy
a petty thief now deceased
ill respect your wishes should you choose to file charges against the state attorney
in the eyes of a young boy henessey finds redemption
sun passing into mystery
caitlin is in the yard chasing a big floppy eared labrador
on the porch a cricket chirps
hal comes out sits beside his wife charly as she finishes eating
says softly just talked to dr
sullivan shes gonna need the full braces
even with your teaching insurance wont cover it
i dont know what to do
charly says nothing
the dog parades up to caitlin with a stick in its jaws
a farm truck goes by a faraway speck
charly absent mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers
eyes far away
it never occurs to her what shes done until the chirping stops
ten feet away the knife quivers
