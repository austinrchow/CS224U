in the winter of these men were commissioned by the united states national science foundation to gather data concerning the physical and natural sciences on the continent of antarctica
the interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and compartments within the compound
sturdy but prefabricated materials have been used in its construction
there is a laboratory
a kitchen and mess hall
a communications room and sleeping quarters
other cubicles are for storage and supplies
the most spacious area of the building and the main center of activity is the rec room
of the many entrance ways to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment
the below quarter houses the generator and still other compartments for storage
a long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the dog kennel
from out of the billions the smallest of specks drives slowly forward
it closes getting larger its features becoming more identifiable a vessel
flip flopping out of control
its stern roaring with flame
it passes its blue fire surging into the screen
gusts of snow
superimpose loud and strident
a helicopter streaks across frame
it travels precariously close to the ground its chassis battered and swayed by the wind
red dials beam on the faces of two men
one carries a rifle and searches the horizon with binoculars
the other pilots
their unkempt faces their blazing eyes notate a wildness
they bark at each other in some scandinavian tongue
two men arguing like mad and desperate children
the man with the binoculars sights something
it turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards to its rear
then whirls and gallops off
a gun blast kicks up snow at its heels
another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his prey
the pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and implores for better aim
the craft swoops lower and the engine is put into full throttle
running feverishly up and over a hill of ice
a weather beaten wooden sign sticks up on the other side a rifle blast kicks up more snow
a large almost snow covered building
not far from that a tall meteorological balloon tower
a scattering of several small shacks at varying distances from the main compound
the smaller hovels are connected by wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes
multicolored pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions to outdoor experiments
a tractor and two helicopters sit idle covered with mounds of continuously mounting snow
standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the process of letting up a large red balloon
childs a hefty black man is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile
their beards are caked with ice
it is winter and it is harsh
the faint sound of the copter turns their attention
flying ever lower now
the man with the gun leans dangerously outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost
outside the compound look to one another incredulous
much too low now and chastised by the wind attempts a high speed landing directly on the heels of the sprinting dog
it bounces violently on the hard packed surface
passing the dog
a third bounce sends it skidding
it flips its blades snapping off like toothpicks
it lands belly up soundless except for the whine of its engine
the man with the gun rolls out before the explosion
the half a dozen men playing cards monitoring equipment listening to music spring to their feet startled
the dog reaches norris and bennings as they awkwardly wade through the snow toward the downed copter
of the crash his eyes crazed with determination struggles to his feet
heedless of his companion he double times his way to the men and the dog
he reloads his gun and bellows in his scandinavian tongue
norris and bennings have no idea what he is saying
the survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off screaming as he does so his face now caked with blood
the two men are bewildered
the dog jumps up licking and pawing them imploring for safety
the visitor fires
the men jump back in disbelief
what the fu
the crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks after them
his countenance ablaze mad
ice and snow kick up about the terrified americans
a bullet smacks into the dogs hip sending it skidding and howling in pain
childs the black man by the snowmobile takes cover diving behind his machine
bennings is hit
norris pulls drags him back toward the compound
the dog crawls along beside them
the intruder is relentless in his assail
he runs screaming firing screaming reloading and firing
some watch helplessly through the small fogged up and translucent windows
others try to mobilize grabbing for their heavy jackets
as it efficiently breaks through a windowpane and into the cold
a steady hand grips it firmly
suddenly his head jerks back
he falls to his knees and then face down into the snow
stare blankly but relievedly at the fallen man
the dog whimpers in pain
pokes his head out from under the snowmobile
the rumbling of voices fades
the men adjust their eyes to station manager garry as he extracts his gun from the broken window relieves it of its spent shell and puts it away
several men spray snow on the burning wreckage
there is no hope for the pilot
a neat round hole is set in the middle of his forehead
station manager garry holds up something akin to an id
fuchs a young and sensitive looking biologist stands closest to the large area map of antarctica
several men sit and stand around viewing the body that lies on two brought together card tables
gotta be from the norwegian camp
how fars that
bout eighty kilos southwest
surprised that far
garry directs his attention to childs the large black man who had been working on the snowmobile
next to him sits norris the rugged looking fortyish geophysicist who was one of the men being shot at
you catch anything he was saying
am i starting to look norwegian to you bwana
garry motions inquiringly to norris
i caught that he wanted the better part of my ass to come apart
cooper mid forties works on the outstretched leg of bennings the meteorologist
clark the dog handler is mending the hip of the wounded dog off in the corner
bennings lets out with an ouch
dont ouch me
it just grazed you
he helps a shaken bennings up off the table
what in the hell were they doing
flying that low
shooting at a dog
the dog yelps and whimpers as clark tries to calm him
ill be here a while
shells pretty deep
blair senior biologist fifty balding leans against the entrance door
he looks on as the young bored looking radio operator sanchez attends to his equipment
bursts of static
its no go
well get to somebody
weve got to report this mess
look i havent been able to reach shit in two weeks
doubt if anybodys talked to anybody on the whole continent
nauls the cook glides along on his roller stakes down one of the many narrow hallways that connect the various compartments of the main compound
he is black a little mischievous about twenty two
he comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances to the rec room area where the men are gathered with the dead norwegian
maybe we at war with norway
palmer a spacy twenty seven year old novice pilot and mechanic grins as he lights a joint
he directs a remark to station manager garry
was wondering when el capitan was going to get a chance to use his pop gun
garry rebukes him with a stern look and then turns to fuchs
how long have they been stationed there
fuchs leafing through a pile of papers
says here about eight weeks
copper enters the room
bennings limping after him slightly
shaking his head thats not enough time for guys to go bonkers
bullshit bwana sweetheart
five minutes is enough to put a man over down here
i mean palmer been the way he is since the first day
palmer smiles and flips the cook the bird
how many in their party
referring started with six
thered be four others left
how do you know
the mens attention turn to copper
guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us
nothing we can do about that
yes there is
id like to go up
in this weather
turns to bennings
winds are going to let up a tad next couple of hours
cant condone it myself
but it is a short haul
hour there hour back
garry still does not much like the idea
palmer takes another hit off his joint
shit doc ill give you the lift if
forget it palmer
doc youre a pain in the ass
turns norris go get macready
slight laughter from some of the men
grins macready aint going nowhere
bunkered in till spring
just go get him
stands anyway hes probably ripped
norris bundled in his sixty five pounds of clothing exits the main compound
he walks the prefab wooden planks up the precipice his destination is someone a hundred yards up the slope to a shack
he grabs onto the steadying ropes and pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet
being dumped into a glass followed by the pouring of whiskey
an electronic voice is heard
bishop to knight four
macready takes a sip of his drink makes his way over to his electronic chess game
a large mexican sombrero hangs on his back
he is tall about thirty five
his shack is sparse but unkempt
a few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by an occasional poster of some mediterranean or south american paradise
the chess game is of larger than normal size
the pieces move automatically with the press of a button
he sits down and chuckles over his opponents bad move
poor little son of a bitch
youre starting to lose it arent you
he confidently taps out his move
his companions response is immediate
pawn takes queen at knight four
macreadys grin slowly fades as he examines the board
there is a pounding at his door
macready broods for a bit heedless of his visitor and makes his next move
rook to knight six
more impatient pounding
macready glares at his opponent for a beat
he bends forward opens up a flap containing the chess games circuitry and pours in his drink
there ensues a snapping popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the machine followed by a flush of chess gibberish
macready gets up from his seat mumbling on his way to the door
he opens the door
norris steps in followed by a flurry of snow and wind
you jerking off or just pissed
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply
get your gear on
one of the grounded choppers is being readied for take off
childs holds a huge industrial torch to the engine warming it up
garry bennings dr
copper palmer and macready wind their way through the slender corridors on their way to the chopper
copper carries a satchel of medicine supplies
macready going over his flight chart looks mad as hell
this is goddamn insane
quit the griping macready
sooner youre there sooner youre back
its against regulations to go up this time of year
four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there
so i dont want to end up crawling around with them when we go down
look if youre going to keep bitching macready palmers offered to take him up
what are you talking
hes had two months training in those choppers
to bennings what is it out there anyway
forty five knots
disgusted and the horse you rode in on
sixteen for how long
you cant predict this time of year
copper sits next to macready who is at the controls
macready tightens the string of his sombrero around his neck and starts up its choking engine
macready fights violently with the controls as he struggles to get the craft into the air
it finally rights itself and moves up and off into the grey white sky
a couple of the men mingle in the area
clark the dog handler looks out the window
macs really taking it up huh
the dog a large bandage on his hip wades through the room
past mens legs
it hobbles slightly
no one takes notice
moves over a ridge of ice
columns of smoke can be seen rising ominously from a quarter mile off
as they near the smoke looms thicker
a black tar like gush billowing up into the grey sky from the whiteness below
smoke climbs upward in the f
macready sets his craft down
pull back to reveal the camp itself resembling the aftermath of a western fort sacked and ravaged by indians
small fires and debris are strewn everywhere
the prefab administration building exposes gaping holes
smoke rises from the almost entirely snow buried quonset huts
embers swirl in every direction
the two men look at each other in silence
they get out
smoldering to a close
a hastily conceived crematorium
wood books furniture tires anything that will burn has been mixed together with the charred remains of several dogs and the body of a man
curious mounds of a melted and blackened goo are heaped within the mess
a small can of gasoline lies nearby
a large oil drum not far off
their faces ashen as they take in this grotesque sight
macready turns to view the norwegian compound
he then exchanges a look with copper
macready heads back toward the chopper
macready unhinges the shotgun that is latched to the panel behind the seats
macready and dr
copper stand hesitantly amidst the wisps of snow and embers
macready tries the door
it is unlocked
he slowly pushes it open with his gun
a long pitch black corridor
copper shines a flashlight
they exchange a look and enter
the two men move slowly
it is dank and cold
their breath bleating like exhaust
a soft steady wind howls overhead
the flashlight is not much help
further down they hear a faint hissing sound
as they get closer it more resembles static
the flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor
the sputtering static comes from within
the face of the door has been shredded
an ax sticks out from its middle
macready wrenches out the ax
there is blood on it
the men acknowledge this for a beat
macready tries the knob
it opens slightly
something is blocking it from the other side
anybody in there
come to help you
macready pushes against the door
give me a hand
they push shove grunt
the door gives a bit
it widens enough for macready to see that a large computer like machine is blocking their path
macready wedges in and shines the flashlight
it is the communications room
holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold
the flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair
one more nudge allows them into the room
a beat as they catch their breath
macready spots a coleman lantern
he lights it with a match
holds it up
the brighter light exposes the top of a mans head sitting in the radio chair
the chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze
they inch closer
a yard from the chair macready stops the doctor
he pokes his gun at the chairs back
copper spots something
from the mans wrist on the armrest he follows a long yarn thick red line ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor
the two men step around the chair
the norwegian stares up in blanched death
a gaping black hole for a mouth
his throat and wrists slit
an old fashioned straight razor in his lap
macready turns off the hissing radio and marches to the other door
it is locked and barricaded
more to himself my god what in hell happened here
come on copper
the two men free a machine like obstacle from the other exit
macready opens a lock and pushes the door open
copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous underground causeway
irritated theyre not swedish goddamn it theyre norwegian macre whap
something slaps into the doctors face from the darkness
the lantern crashes to the ground
the doctor stumbles falls
macready grabs the flashlight and whirls in different directions
a panting beat
copper holds up what hit him
a thick centerfold buffeted by the wind
macready takes it
norwegian of the month doc
macready pockets it for further viewing
the supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked from the constantly moving ice underneath
the evidence of fire has further weakened the foundations
the wood creaks overhead
bits of ice and silt trickle down
the two men walk hunched cautious
macready gingerly tries to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam
he brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning roof
the two men wait until it subsides and then moves on
macreadys knee bumps into something along the wall causing him to stumble slightly
he shines his light on it
an arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off the ground
the door has been slammed shut
the arm pinned its fist still gripping a small welding torch
the flame long since gone out
wincing holy shit
he tries the door
the arm drops to the ground
it has been severed by the force of the slam
its owner is nowhere to be seen
macready sickened coughs
they step over the arm and into another slim passageway
moving along they come to rest in front of a door with norwegian lettering on it
macready pushes it open with his foot
dozens of papers fly about flailed by the holes in the quonset hut style roof
the place is a wreck
macready surveying the small room with his flashlight
broken beakers test tubes a microscope are illuminated
macready notices a video camera
portable video unit
copper makes his way over to the main work table
he shuffles through papers glancing at the writing
all in norwegian
copper bends down and begins gathering the papers strewn about the room
what are you doing
could be important work
might as well bring it back
its getting late
im going to check the last few rooms
amongst the rubble dr
copper finds a pocket tape recorder and several cassettes
he selects a tape and is about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear
macready shoves himself into another room
debris and wood flush down on him
the receding ceiling had been blocking the door from above
he brushes his coat and shines the light upwards
the ceiling is a shambles
he then shines the light deeper into the room
copper is playing the small tape recorder
a casual norwegian voice drones on as if making notes
he fast forwards
the same casual drone
copper come here
copper enters squeezing in through the door
the wood cracks overhead
more debris comes falling down
its about to go
copper dusts himself
macready stands before a huge block of ice
fifteen feet long
six feet wide
four feet tall
it has partially melted but its thawing process has been stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost
its one curious feature the middle has been thawed and scooped out
giving it the appearance of a large bathtub
the two men study it uncomprehendingly
macreadys gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left
he moves for a closer look
several photographs are pasted to its door
small snapshots of the norwegians at work and play
he tries to open it
the partially caved in ceiling is slightly blocking the top of the door
he tries again careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above
bits of dust float down
his grip is too strong
it gives suddenly unexpectedly
the large metal door flies open
large chunks splash from the ceiling
they come thumping to the floor behind and in front of the open cabinet door
macready coughs and waves away the dust
he peers inside
some empty shelves
some small scientific gear
his flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door
it is a picture of five norwegians arm in arm all smiles toasting each other
they are on either side of the frozen block of ice pridefully displaying it for the camera
the block looks much thicker
its interior opaque
macready looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph
he untapes it pockets it and shuts the door
an armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door
dislodged from the ceiling the body and macready go crashing to the floor
the loud beat of warren zevons song the werewolves of london can be heard throughout the compound
the room is empty
close on a video pong game its ball of light lazily traveling back and forth
the dog its tail wagging its bandage on walks by
zevons record is blasting from nauls stereo
he skates from the big walk in freezer and plunks down a large side of beef on the wood cutting table to thaw
he skates from pot to pan keeping time with his sounds
adds a little something here a touch there
he clearly enjoys his work
station manager garry stops past the open door
turn that crap down nauls
you can hear it all over the camp
he skates over and turns it down but not much
garry enters and sees that sanchez has nodded off in front of his receiver
his headgear is still on
garry walks over and turns up the volume the static jolting sanchez awake
you reach anybody yet
were a thousand miles from anybody else man
its going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better
well stick to it
an empty hallway
larger than most
doors to several sleeping quarters on either side
the dog slowly walks through
one of the doors is open up ahead of his left
the dog stops in front of it and looks in
someone is inside
inside the small cubicle a slight portion of a mans back can be seen as he sits bent over a chair his large shadow displayed on the wall
back in the corridor
the dog looks up the hall once and casually to the other end
he enters the room
the sound of a mans voice too indistinct to tell whose mumbles hello boy
the sound of a glass breaking
a muffled scuffling
the door is slammed shut from the inside
and then silence
fuchs the young biologist is finishing up his daily jog around the compound
he stops at the end of a long quonset hut almost completely buried in the snow
the hut is fifty yards long and connects to the main compound
he enters a tunnel from a latch door up top
he jogs down the steps passing the underground dog kennel and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel
he passes and waves to clark who rolls along a wheelbarrow of dog food
opens the door to the small kennel and serves up the dinner
the dogs about seven of them yelp and bark eagerly
near the fuel supply bladders
older and more rickety than the quarters above
childs waltzes through humming a big smile on his face
he stops at a door with six locks on it
combination locks key locks etc
he opens each one separately
inside are several marijuana plants
sun lamps beam down on them
childs inspects them with a wide grin
how my brothers and sister doing today
he moves over to a tape deck selects a cassette grins back at the plants and turns it on
what say to some nice al green for my babies huh
he waters them carefully as al green sings softly
he hears a panting and turns around to see the dog
his bandage is gone
you get the hell on out of here
the dog is shooed off
childs turns back grumbling
comin in here
goin to urinate on my babies
blair passing through holding a chart and carrying a rack of test tubes notices a large bandage on the floor
he picks it up inquiringly
it is mangled and shredded
palmer works on the generator
he hears the sound of approaching propeller blades from outside
and then the sound of his tool box crashing to the floor
he turns to see what caused the ruckus
the dog who has entered the shed has jumped on the work table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out of the above window
palmer curses under his breath and calls out
will you kennel this goddamn dog
bangs wrench against pipe hey clark
it paws at the window and watches as the chopper carrying macready and dr
copper fights against the newly arrived heavy winds and lands safely
garry macready dr
copper norris bennings blair and his assistant fuchs are present
the small norwegian video unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a tv screen
grainy home movie ish no sound
the proceedings are grim
shots of the norwegians at work
others of them playing soccer on ice
generally the footage is a prosaic record of their day to day life
norris shuffles the bundle of notes dr
copper brought back with him
seems they were spending a lot of time at a place four miles northeast of their camp
what were they involved in
macready working on the video machine answers
little ice core drilling
same old shit we do
the present footage is a shot of them all naked and probably drunk holding a sign across their waists as they stand outdoors in super freezing weather
how much more of this crap is there
about nine more hours
we cant learn anything from this
macready turns on the light and shuts off the video machine
he then slides the portable tape deck across the table to dr
they exchange a look
macready and i were listening to some of these cassettes on the way back
somberly like you gentlemen to hear it
a norwegian voice drones on calmly making verbal notes
what do you want from us
flat just listen
copper fast forwards
the calm voice continues
and then a loud blast followed by pounding
the sounds of confusion
mens feet running up and down wooden floorboards
and then a screeching
more blasts mixed with the din of wild carnage wrought cries
and then more screeching
a screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard
the men look from one another in silence as they listen
copper turns it off
goes on like that quite awhile
beat what do you gentlemen make of it
could be anything
men in isolation
some beef that snowballed
got out of hand
maybe the whole camp got bent
something they ate
what about food poisoning doc
copper taps the tape deck pensively
he glances at macready and then back to the others
theres something else we want you to see
copper and macready begin dumping the heavy contents of a large plastic trash bag onto the slab
we found this
displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a man
what is left of the trousers and shoes of the bottom torso are ripped and split as if his legs and feet had burst from the inside
his upper body is an almost undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush
the head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal
it is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen
tendon like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and sticking up and out in odd postures
one is wrapped around the bodys left leg
the shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar like mess
the men grimace
i know hes pretty badly burned
but could fire have done this
blair sickened but fascinated pokes at the tendon like things and the tarry goo
blair id like you and fuchs to help me with autopsies on this one and the one garry shot this morning
nauls and clark are going at it hot and heavy
sanchez sits off in a corner thumbing through an old issue of photoplay
bennings norris and garry are engaged in a card game
bennings is about to play a card when he feels something under the table
it is the dog
clark will you put this mutt with the others where he belong
larger than most of the other rooms and well equipped
copper is performing an autopsy on the norwegian intruder killed early that morning
blair sits over his microscope while fuchs prepares slides
the other body is draped with a sheet waiting its turn
copper pulls off his gloves
nothing wrong with this one
to blair find anything toxic
clark leads the dog through the long cold tunnel toward the kennel
a new dressing has been placed on its hip
he unlatches the door to the kennel and leads him in
about twenty feet long five feet wide
cramped with dogs
some of them sleeping
others pacing around and curious greet their new companion sniffing panting and rubbing up against him
clark pats the dog and several others then leaves latching the door behind him
childs lies in his cot watching a small television
the show is a tape of an american tv game show
he has seen this one too many times extracts the cassette and injects another game show
palmer is stretched out in the other cot reading a comic book and smoking a joint
childs beckons for it and takes a hit
a small area just off the rec room
set up like a bar
macready is alone looking over the rest of the videotapes from the norwegian outpost
mundane to esoteric chores of antarctic camp life
he looks bored
blair hovering over the microscope lays in a slide focuses and motions for dr
copper to take a look
copper is confused as he examines
i dont understand
fuchs takes the opportunity to look
blair moves over to the disfigured corpse and indicates one of the fibrous tendon like appendages
its tissue from one of these sinewy rods
fuchs is befuddled as he examines
what in the world kind of cell structure is this
thats the point
tired i dont get you blair
im not sure it is any kind of cell structure
sighing this really isnt my field blair
lets wrap for the day
copper undoes his lab coat and lays it over a chair as he exits
blair stares down ominously at the mutilated body
a steady stream of sleet pounds the compound and small surrounding shacks
the wall clock reads four thirty
sleeping cubicles on either side
the sound of snoring
bleary eyed macready is in the process of blowing up some strange inflatable object
as he puffs away he still keeps an eye on the norwegian video tapes
his balloon begins to take shape
it blossoms into a life size replica of a full breasted woman
something on the tape catches his eye
he rewinds then starts it forward again
the screen shows the norwegians on the surface of what appears to be an enormous flat glacier
they are spread out on the ice around a large odd oval shape their arms outstretched
it fades to black and then a norwegian comes on mugging childishly in front of the camera apparently quite pleased with something
the tape fades to black again and the picture reappears
this time they have marked off the large oval area with flag sticks
closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into the ice
there is a small patch of something dark and metallic at the bottom
macready leans forward intrigued
the men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various points around the markings
macready squints and mumbles to himself
the tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings
no norwegian in sight
an explosion kicks up the ice
a beat as the ice sprays to the ground
then the camera appears to shake as the ground beneath it quivers
another immense explosion follows
an earthquake like force throws the camera to the ground
the tape continues distorted unviewable
a distinct crack in the lens
macready lets go of his companion and quickly rewinds
the deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around the room
most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging
the new dog watches them calmly silently
he takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs and sits upright
he stares at them
the dogs are aware of something
they begin to seem a bit confused uncomfortable
the new dog continues to stare
sitting rigidly unnaturally still
his eyes dead lusterless black spheres
bewildered a few dogs start to pace
as if sensing something a portent
but so odd
they begin a soft purring growl
the new dog remains a statue
the growling builds
more dogs begin to pace
emitting hisses snarls
the lack of response driving them into a frenzy
more frenetic pacing
the din escalating
three dogs start to close in on the stranger
against the kennel wall
the shadow suddenly lurches upward seeming larger
the kennel roars
macready is still going over bits of the same footage fascinated
he hears the far off clamor of the dogs
he too bothered by the noise tosses and turns in his sleep
macready has entered
macready nudges him
clark rolls away annoyed
macready pinches his snoring nose cutting off the air
clark sits up groggy
dogtowns going nuts
take care of it
clark sleepy irritated makes his way down the freezing corridor
the wind soughing loudly overhead
reaches the kennel door
the savage outpouring of noise from within baffles and angers him
he unlatches the door
whats got into
just as he opens the door two dogs as if jettisoned from a cannon knock him off his feet
growls barks snarls
and a screeching from within
macready is fetching himself a beer
the sound of the far off screeching
he turns and sprints
as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm
he pulls the lever
the alarm is blaring throughout the camp
macready garry norris run through the narrow tunnel led by clark
macready carries a shotgun
garry half dressed has his
clark a fire ax
i dont know what the hells in there but its weird and pissed off whatever it is
men half naked bounce from their cubicle
pulling on their pants digging into shoes
childs is grappling with his belt buckle
mac wants the what
at the doorway thats what he said
bennings is off
as the men approach the locked kennel door
the two dogs thrown into clark back ferociously and scratch at the door trying to get back in
one is badly bloodied
the fight inside rages on
macready and clark brace themselves by the narrow door
norris and garry hold back the two hysterical dogs
clark undoes the latch and he and macready enter the kennel
the light has been broken and it is pitch black
macready snaps on his flashlight
norris and garry cant contain their animals and the dogs burst into the room
they smash into macready and send him sprawling
total confusion the dogs the men the screeching the blackness
mac where are you
macready gropes for his flashlight and rights himself
he finds clark
then shines it around the cramped room trying to get his bearings
the light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner
barking mixed with hissing a gurgling a screeching
dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray with a vengeance
the flashlight illuminates parts of some thing
but not quite
impossible to tell
it struggles powerfully
garry pokes his head into the blackness
whats going on damn it
macready aims his shotgun at the entire pack
im going to shoot
clark wades into the pack grabs at dogs hides and throws them back
he then wields his ax into the fray chopping and hacking away at the gurgling hissing silhouette
from out of nowhere a large bristly arachnid like leg springs up and wraps around clarks ax
it sends clark smashing violently into the wall
more men running nearing the kennel
several squeezing in with garry trying to get a look
macready fires several rounds
a dog is flung at him knocking him and his flashlight once more to the ground
garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction of the hissing and screeching
a dog is hit
macready crawls for his flashlight
where are you
garry continues firing at the silhouette
childs huffing and puffing lugs the huge industrial torch toward the crowded kennel doorway
childs you got the torch
you get your ass in here
childs scrunches in disoriented by the blackness and bumps into garry knocking him off balance
where are you
macready signals with his flashlight and then points it at the gathering of snarling dogs
torch it over there
screw the dogs
childs lets loose with a burst of blue flame
a mewing a screeching
part of the kennel starts to burn
panic were on fire
dont let up childs
to outside extinguishers
childs moves closer continuing his assault on the hissing gurgling presence
men charge into the room and begin spraying dogs and burning walls
dogs and men choke and cough amidst the smoke and the screeching lessens
the hissing and gurgling fade
childs turns off his torch
those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet uneasiness
blair in silent awe stands over the badly burned corpses of two interlocking dogs that lie before him on a table
they are connected as if they were one animal
though the one wearing the remnants of clarks bandage is much larger and appears less dog like
its entire torso is cracked and peeled as if its innards were trying to burst out
odd appendages recoiled and withered by the flame are wrapped grotesquely about both bodies
clark his eyes set in glassy stare sits in shock
nauls comforts him
childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring at the floor
blair transfixed continues hovering over the united cadavers
a very worried look on his face
the dead bodies of two other dogs from the kennel are not far off
fuchs is attending to the shredded bodies of three other badly wounded dogs
nauls pats clark on the shoulder and grins trying to pick up his spirits
its okay now man
beat you see
clark turns to him with a childlike smile
childs killed it
norris is going through some maps
macready is bent over his shoulder
norris finds the one hes looking for
this is where they were spending most of their time
bennings pokes his head in the room
pretty nasty out mac
thirty five knots
screw it im going up anyway
station manager garry has joined blair by the stuck together bodies
blair motions to the bandage
was that dog the norwegian dog
i just cant comprehend any of this
it was just a dog
evenly twerent no dog bwana
that tape macready showed us this morning
couldnt make much of it myself
ive asked him to try and locate the site
okay with you
you think theres a connection
high above the antarctic expanse
young palmer and norris are with him
it is clear but the winds are troublesome
the ride is a shaky one
norris refers to their map
one of their sites would be directly over here
they aim for a large mountainous wall
as they go up and over
they see on the surface an enormous blackened oval shape
all the bodies of the dogs have been brought in
fuchs stands by as blair studies through his microscope
of two cells
they appear to be much different from each other
they are joined at the ends but are completing the process of breaking off from each other
a disturbed look on his face
he checks his watch as if timing the procedure
as they walk along the ice
they come to a stop at the edge of a sharp drop
pull back to reveal the massive black hole about fifteen feet beneath the ice
charred gnarled and mangled metal are all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere
macreadys and norris eyes meet each other in silence
palmer is in awe
macready finds a burst thermite canister
he and norris climb down
they move along amongst the wreck
almost everything but the skeletal superstructure has disintegrated into a fine ashy powder
norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage while macready browses through the center
palmer continues to marvel as he walks around the oval atop the ice
macready returns and kneels down next to norris as the latter examines a piece of metal
magnesium of some type
or some kind of strange alloy
looks out at debris in disgust and those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it
so what do you make of it
you know damn well what we both make of it
no chance it could have been some new kind of test craft
norris shakes his head no
seismic activity has been pushing this are up from way down for a long time
holds up ice sample this ice it was buried in
its over a hundred thousand years old
palmer calls out waving them over
the two men join palmer about fifty yards from the oval
a large rectangular chunk has been cut out of the ice
it is fifteen feet long six feet wide and eight feet deep
macready kneels down to observe
a gust of wind picks up the snow at their feet
fascinated a few of the men are reviewing the norwegian video tapes of the finding of the mysterious craft
macready sits quietly by his chess set contemplating a large glass of scotch
clark less interested than the others is flipping through the norwegian nudie magazine
blair looking worried sits off in a corner pondering the photo of the block of ice and fingering a piece of crumbled up metal brought back from the site
childs viewing the tapes cant quite believe it all
okay now mac run this by me again
thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes right
macready is not listening
look im just guessing
well go on
nauls about to prepare dinner scowls as he rummages through his many cabinets
wheres that big ol steel pot of mine
he turns to examine the cabinets above the large stove
he spots something in the nearby kitchen trash can
disgusted he pulls out a torn and shredded pair of long johns
so it crashes and this guy whoever he is gets thrown out or walks out and ends up freezing
i just cant believe this voodoo bullshit
you believe this voodoo bullshit blair
blair says nothing lost in thought
palmer stoned a joint dangling from his mouth is searching for information through stacks of old issues of the national enquirer and the star
rambling happens all the time man
theyre falling out of the skies like flies
government knows all about it
chariots of the gods man
they practically own south america
i mean they taught the incas everything they knew
cool it palmer
palmer shakes a magazine at him adamantly
read von daniken
have you read von daniken
get your facts straight
clark marvels at a particular photo
jesus why would those guys ever want to leave norway
nauls skates into the room
he shakes the crumpled up pair of long johns in his fist
which one you muthers been tossing his dirty underwear in the kitchen trash
he flings it across the room
it lands on macreadys chess set
i want my kitchen clean
nauls spins on his skates and storms off
macready fetches the strangely shredded underwear and rolls it up while childs paces
so macready come on now
these norwegian dudes come by
find him and dig him up
macready tosses the ball of cloth across the room into a trash bin
yeah they dig him up and cart him back
he gets thawed out wakes up and scares the shit out of them
and they get into one hell of a brawl
now hows this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice huh
annoyed i dont know how
because hes different than we are
because hes a space guy
what do you want from me anyway
go ask blair
you buy any of this blair
a beat as blair stares straight ahead transfixed
he speaks softly to no one particular
it was here
got to that dog
it was here in this camp
the men take in his grave countenance
its over with
blair turns to them
the men search his face
edgy well isnt it
as blair rips it off exposing the tangled mess of interlocking dogs
all the men have gathered
some of the men settle into chairs others stand
whatever that norwegian dog was
it was capable of changing its form
indicates their dog when it attacked our dog
it somehow was able to digest
and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dogs cells exactly
holds up gooey dog leg this for instance isnt dog at all its imitation
we got to it before it had time to finish or
i think the whole process would have taken an hour
and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form
well that thing in the ice sure werent no dog
impatient of course not
but whatever it was revived it
well the thing was probably disoriented
and realized it couldnt survive for long in our atmosphere
but being the incredibly adaptable creature it was
it tried to become something that could
before the norwegians killed it
it somehow got to this dog
what do you mean got to the dog
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce whatever it ate or absorbed cell for cell
the concept is staggering
i dont fully understand it myself
skeptically points youre saying
that big muther in the ice became the dog
nodding i think were talking about an organism
that could imitate other life forms
it could have gone on and on
it could have become one dog
it could have become as many dogs as it wanted to and without losing any of its original mass
you been into childs weed blair
blair slams his fist on the slab
look i know its hard to believe
breaking in so whats our problem
theres still some cell activity
its not entirely dead yet
several of the men nearest the carcasses jump back knocking over a chair
lying on the snow
they are being soaked with gasoline
in violent protestation you cant do this
you cant burn these remains
fuchs is beside himself
childs has the large torch
macready empties another can on the bodies
copper stands nearby
and the horse you rode in on fuchs
to childs light it up
childs lights the tip
fuchs makes a determined move for the torch
well im not going to let this happen
childs struggles with him for a beat and then flings him to the ground
copper grabs him preventing him from getting back up
childs splays the remains with a jet of flame
fuchs shakes his head in frustration and disgust
i just cant believe it
were going to go down as the biggest bunch of assholes in history
at least were going to live to be an old bunch of assholes
the night feeding
clark dishes out the food
blair is taking blood samples from the remaining three dogs
perplexed bothered clark did you notice anything strange about that dog
just anything at all
any little thing
just that he recovered real quick
that night when i found him in the rec room he had already scraped off his bandage
before i put him with the others i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good
a beat as blair stares at clark
pets dog vigorously yeah
what was he doing in the rec room
well after i worked on him thought id let him rest
left the room for a bit
when i came back he was gone
well where was he
where did he go
looked for him for a bit
couldnt find him
a long beat youre saying he wasnt put into the kennel until the night
clark seems uneasy under blairs intense gaze
blair stands his eyes still glued to clark
how long were you with the dog
alone i mean
he was hurt bad
bullet nicked an artery
i dont know
hour and a half
blairs eyes glaze as if in revelation
what the hell you looking at me like that for
nothing at all
he backs out of the kennel
irritated distressed station manager garry moves briskly down the hall
blair worried and pale tries to keep up with him
it could have gotten to somebody
i dont mean infection
garry stops at the entrance to the communications room
any luck yet
couple seconds of an argentine disco station
well stick with it
i want you at it round the clock
we got to get help in here
no you cant let anyone in here
that dog was all over this camp
bennings interrupts entering the hallway referring to his meteorological chart
to garry travel wise tomorrow may be okay
but after that some pretty nasty northeasterly shits coming in
the men outside come stomping through the hallway
pleading listen to me garry
to macready if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody im sending you and doc up to macmurdo
you cant let people leave
i aint going anywhere in anything over forty knots garry
snapping the hell you wont macready
dont you understand
that thing didnt want to become a dog
fed up damn you blair
youve already got everybody half hysterical around here
you cant let anybody leave
ive got six dead norwegians on my hands a burned up flying saucer and weve just destroyed the scientific find of the century
now fuck off
close on blair ashen faced falling silent
as if in a daze he watches the men as they continue to converse
pitch black except for the barest of lighting which outlines the building
the swirl of ice
far away from the others macready sits in his little hovel putting the final screw into his mended chess set
on the other side of the set his busty inflatable companion has been propped up in a chair
his sombrero hangs down her back keeping her in place
hawaiian music plays from his tape deck
he puts down his screwdriver holds up his glass and offers a toast with a big grin
he clinks the drink he has made for her that rests on her side of the board
he turns on the machine and makes his first move
now go easy on me esperanza
im just a beginner
the set answers for esperanza
rook takes bishop at queen four rook take pawn at queen two rook takes queen at queen one checkmate
he flips open the circuitry panel in disgust
he tosses his screwdriver on the board and grabs his drink downing it
he reaches inside his ice bucket
never any damn ice around here
he swacks at a nearby bank of ice with a small ice pick
now in mexico
they got ice
they got ice coming out of their ears
the sound of a clanking
he turns his attention
metal against metal
it appears to be coming from far off below near the camp
as he makes his way down with the aid of the steadying ropes
the clanking louder now
he senses the direction
at the bottom near the main compound
the sound has stopped
he looks around in the near blackness
sitting idle in the dark
the door to one of the cockpits is slightly ajar
he opens it cautiously
macready slips in
he turns on a flashlight
the controls have been mangled
beaten with something heavy
macready startled turns
like the sound of a gun
coming from the main compound
he grabs palmer as he and bennings rush by
hes gone berserk
hes in the radio room
got a gun
beat on sanchez something fierce
the men are on either side of the open radio room doorway
garry peeks his head in
a gunshot blast forces him back
sanchez lies on the floor groaning
blair holds the gun on the door
he wields a fire ax with the other hand and smashes down on the radio
anybody interferes ill kill
nobodys getting in or out of this camp
macready has joined the others
he smashed one of the choppers up good
childs go check the other one and the tractor
childs is off
blair crunches the ax down once again while keeping an eye on the door
you think im crazy
most of you dont know whats going on but im damn well sure some of you do
crunch the back window
a couple of us could maybe surprise him
too damn dangerous
you think this thing wants to become an animal
dogs cant make it miles to the sea
no skua gulls to imitate this time of year
no penguins this far inland
dont you understand
it wanted to become us
he brings the ax down hard on the radio
childs runs up out of breath
he got both choppers and the tractor
i dont know how bad yet
garry readies his large
no wait a minute
to norris the fuse box
norris double times down the hall
macready turns the corner and into the rec room
he grabs one of the thick card tables
macready returns with the table to the hallway
cant you see
if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth
nothing could stop it
humoring look blair maybe youre right about this
but weve got to be rational
weve got to talk this over
im unarmed and im coming in
no youre not
i dont trust any of you
reaches the fuse box
he opens it
macready readies the table like a shield
if youre right weve all got to stick together
the lights go out
macready charges into the black room
macready barrels into him knocking him to the ground
he pummels him with a right hand and manages to control the gun
the others dive in and pile on
heavily clothed macready fuchs and dr
copper help a dazed blair to a toolshed some seventy five yards from the main compound
more spacious than macreadys
blair has been placed on the cot
copper injects him with a sedative
why am i here
its for your own protection blair
and mainly ours
fuchs and macready nail boards over the windows
leave a bit of an opening so he can see out
blairs droopy eyed heavily drugged features loom up at macready through the window
how you doin old boy
softly i dont know who to trust
humoring know what you mean blair
trust is a tough thing to come by these days
just trust in the lord
beat watch clark
watch him close
ask him why he didnt kennel the dog
blairs face disappears from the window
harsh and grey
getting very dark as winter takes a stronger hold
bennings is dumping the trash in a large hole in the snow which acts as the trash dump
bennings finishes and drags the empty bins past palmer and childs who are fixing the wounded choppers
the radio looks a mess
norris and sanchez a bandage wrapped around his head examines the damage
he is in pain and still looks a little groggy
ill see what i can do
but they didnt teach me much about fixing these things
norris smiles and pats him comfortingly
they didnt teach you much about working them either
the men help themselves
it is a cramped elongated room
copper approaches nauls and hands him a capsule
put this in blairs juice before you take him his tray
clark comes running into the room pallid out of breath
the men turn to look
clark and garry examine the latch of the kennel door
doesnt look broken
door was wide open
i know i latched it
close on the dogs tracks in the snow
they lead from the kennels open stairwell and out onto the ice
all the men have gathered
all three of them took off
macready is writing down what appears to be a list on a pad
how long do you suppose theyve been gone
i havent seen them since their last feeding
could be as much as twenty four hours
they couldnt have gotten that far in this weather
garry and several others turn to macready quizzically
youre not thinking of going after them are you
i am going after them
what in the hell for
even if blairs right theyll just die out there
theyre over a thousand miles from anything
chopper arent going to be ready for days
macready hands his list to bennings
get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles
youre not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got
palmer how long would it take you to strap those big four cylinder carburetors on
grins oh i got you
not too long
then get a move on
childs come with me
he puts his arm around childs and pulls him along
the others watch them walk off a little bewildered
shouting after them besides what are you going to do when you catch up to them
bennings is reading macreadys list
hands list to garry whatever hes going to do he aint fucking around
of the large torch
a fierce stream of flame bursts from its nozzle
the stream has shot out some fifteen feet
childs has been modifying it
i can get maybe another five or six feet out of it
thats good enough
as he works on the snowmobiles
into frame rolls a wheelbarrow on sleds
a box marked dynamite is its most prominent article
bennings reads off the list of supplies
box of dynamite
box of thermite
box of flares
two flare guns
thirty cans gasoline
and a case of alcohol
lets load em
the two vehicles rip across the hard flat ice bolstered by the added horsepower
they follow the still visible dog tracks in the snow
sliding across the horizon signaling midday
the snowmobiles whoosh past
bennings drives the one loaded with supplies
macready and childs double up on the other
steadying his binoculars while childs drives spots something up ahead
the vehicles slow down and come to a halt
something lies just ahead of them in the whiteness in the middle of the dog tracks
kneel down by the something
it is the half eaten remains of a dog
its hind legs and lower stomach picked clean
its ripped hide flapping in the wind
its top half missing
what is it
macready follows the line of continuing dog tracks
dogs dont eat each other
beat i know
wheres the other half
probably the next meal
macready moves to the snowmobile and grabs a two gallon can of gasoline
he turns to bennings
where these tracks headed
just straight to the ocean
a beat as macready takes this in
he pours the gas over the remains and sets it aflame
childs and bennings are not that anxious to continue
they could be hours ahead of us mac
gonna get dark soon too
supposed to be fifty below tonight
macready gets on and revs up the engine
turn back if you want
childs and bennings return shrugs
making its last pass rolling off the horizon
only a slight orange hue left
move slower positioned on either side of the tracks
the tracks abruptly change direction
the men come to a stop
it is much colder now
their beards a mask of white powder
macready surveys the new direction
they are headed toward a far off ridge of bluffs
large windswept mounds of ice
as they move through a valley of newly formed dunes and tall ice cliffs
the last of the sun obscured the headlamps are turned on and pointed at the tracks
the men look behind in front and from side to side as they proceed cautiously through the maze
up ahead macready spots it sits its back to them unconcerned heedless of their arrival
it is munching on the other half of the dog carcass
the men stop their machines some twenty yards from it
they are hemmed in at the valleys narrowest point
childs carrying the torch and macready armed with a thermite bomb wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal in their snowshoes
bennings stands back by the snowmobiles
childs and macready spread out some dozen feet from the dog
it continues to pay them no mind content to chew its food
wheres the other one
bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle them with his flashlight
to dog wheres your buddy boy
macready searches the near vicinity with his light
all three are growing uneasy
let that thing fly childs
dont let up until hes ash
childs turns on the gas and lights the tip
bennings is still watching the bluffs
something from beneath the snow reaches up and grabs his feet
he is ripped back down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion
he screams his head the only thing sticking out of the ice
childs and macready turn confused unable to see anything be bennings screaming head
they rush toward him
the sound of a snapping a crackling to macreadys rear
he freezes turns back to the dog
its back is still to him its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine
it snarls its face turns slowly toward him
its skin splitting its mouth ripping open wildly
childs stops confused as to who to help first
he notices the dog hunched and ready to spring
he steps back toward macready
the dog thing leaps for macready an incredible jump of some twenty feet
childs lets loose a blast hitting the dog in midair the force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice in flames
macready throws his thermite canister
it discharges and engulfs the screeching animal in fire
howling in pain
the ice underneath him thrashes violently
childs and macready stand by helplessly unable to see what has him or what action to take
childs moves closer to help
pulls him back stay back
bennings head disappears with a sudden jerk through the ice
the ice continues to rumble like boiling water moving in different directions
part of bennings body pops up in a different area and is just as quickly pulled back down
macready and childs watch on in frustration and anger
what we going to do
how the fuck do i know
bennings head and shoulders then surface near one of the snowmobiles
something has him
unclear as to what
the jowls of a dog
bennings heavy clothing begins to rip tear as if his skin underneath was bulging out
the jowls seem to be absorbing his head
macready runs for the snowmobile
hes gone already
childs blasts away
the ice begins to melt as bennings and whatever has him catch fire
macready grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles
suddenly a steel like arachnid shaped arm shoots out in pain and with incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the snowmobile
macready is knocked back
he recovers and dumps cans of gasoline on the writhing mess
he dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage
he and childs watch on as bennings and the thing roar in flame
behind them the other dog thing continues to burn
the screeching mewing and gurgling wails on all about them
they look to each other in disbelief their faces illuminated by the flickering flames
the strident sounds beginning to subside
its slim orange arc sets signaling the start of the vernal equinox
and the beginning of six months of darkness
the men are interrogating clark
he is frazzled and defensive
im telling you i dont remember leaving the kennel unlatched
childs is holding the industrial torch directly in his face
you left it open so they could get out
macready waist deep in trash and snow searches for something
the interrogation continues
would i even have told you they were gone if i had anything to hide
but why didnt you kennel that dog right away
i told you i couldnt find
pushes torch away get that out of my face
childs grabs him by the collar and rips him off his chair
dont you be telling me
nauls steps between them
to childs lighten your load sucker
you aint the judge and executioner around here
who you trying to protect mutherfucker
im telling you this s
could be one of them
garry breaks it up pulling them apart
macready enters from the outside
a bundle is tucked under his arm
hold on damn it
were getting nowhere
if this bit of blairs about absorbing and imitating is true
then that dog could have gotten to anybody
and if it got to clark
clark could have gotten to anybody
macready moves over to the table
theoretically any of us could be whatever the hell this thing is
norris shakes his head rubbing his chest in slight discomfort
its just too damn wild i cant believe it
macready pushes his sombrero back over his head
well you can believe it now
he drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between the men
it is the shredded pair of long johns
nauls found this yesterday
its ripped just like the clothing on the norwegian we brought back
the same thing was happening to bennings clothes when it got to him
seems these things dont imitate clothes
just flesh and bone
the men look from one another
macready picks it up and examines the label
grins what do you wear clark
i wear a size large too
so do i
so do most of us
the uneasiness in the room grows
doubt if it got to more than one or two of us
but it got to someone
beat somebody in this room aint what he appears to be
a pause as all eyes travel from man to man
scared well what we going to do
norris turns to dr
copper and fuchs
can there be
some kind of test
to find out whos what
a serum test possibly
its a simple blood typing test
this things blood chemistry is different than ours
basically we mix someones blood with uncontaminated human blood
if we dont get the proper serum reaction then that person isnt human
whose uncontaminated blood we going to use
weve got blood plasma in storage
how long will it take you to prepare this
a couple of hours
well get to it
garry unhinges a key from his belt and hands it to dr
copper and fuchs head for the infirmary
hows that thing get to the dogs
i though we stopped it in time
copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight
and that was enough
the rest of you
the men rush in
fuchs and copper stand by the open plasma storage refrigerator
the inside is a mess of dried blood
the bladders have been ripped open
copper is ghastly pale
somebody got to the blood
oh my god
a horrified silence
was it broken into
somebody opened it
and then locked it
sanchez twitches terrified
well whos got access to it
i guess im the only one
and ive got the only key
several pairs of eyes turn to garry
would that test have worked
i think so
somebody else sure as hell thought so
who else could have used that key
i give it to copper when he needs it
could anyone have gotten it from you
i dont see how
when im finished i return it right away
when was the last time you used it
uneasy a day or so ago
garry senses the nervous and inquiring eyes on him
well its possible someone might have lifted it from me
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt
now how could somebody get to it without you knowing
upset flustered look i havent been near that
silence as the men continue to stare
sanchez is perspiring
coppers the only one who has any business with it
the eyes shift from garry to copper
wait a second garry youve been in here on several occasions
and the doc thought of the test
anger so what
is that supposed to leave him in the clear
sanchez bolts out the door
stunned for a beat the others chase after him
in terror runs at top speed through the narrow corridors
opening and shutting doors
the others are in pursuit
they shout for him to stop
as he reaches a small armory
a glass case set into the wall
a half dozen rarely used guns are inside
he tries the handle
he hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing
he breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun
then a box of shells
he frantically tries to load but is too nervous
the others arrive at the end of the hallway
garry pulls his handgun and points
put that down
ill put this right through your head
no one doubts garrys sincerity
you guys going to let him give orders
i mean he could be one of those things
the other regard garry tensely
no one oblivious to the fact that sanchez just might be right
calm put it away sanchez
just put it away
still trembling he tosses the shells back into the broken case leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob
nauls skates over to comfort him
the men watch as garry lowers his gun
he turns to them
i dont know about copper
but i didnt go near that plasma
beat but i guess youll all rest easier if someone else is in charge
he hands his gun to norris
cant see anyone objecting to you norris
rubs chest dont think id be up to it
havent been feeling well lately
childs goes for the gun
ill take it
macready beats him to it
maybe it should be someone a bit more even tempered childs
to others any objections
roving eyes pass about the hallway
nobody is sure who to trust
macready seems as good as any
the men have gathered to discuss plans
furtive and untrustworthy glances are passed around the room
from what we know this thing likes to go one on one
so we stick together as much as possible
in twos and threes
childs points to garry dr
copper and clark
what do we do about those three
we got morphine dont we
well we keep them loaded
stash them here in the rec room and watch em twenty four hours
ears perk up morphine
you know i was pretty close to that dog too
palmer is ignored
we should sleep in shifts
half of us awake at all times
how we going to try and find out whos
you know whos who
to fuchs can you think of any other tests
i could sure use coppers help though
you can eighty six that thought right now man
copper eyes his accuser solemnly
when this thing turns
it turns slowly at first
i think we can handle it in that state
but if it ever got to full power
from what i saw of that norwegian camp
well i just dont know
it would probably take it an hour or more to get like that
so no matter what anybodys doing we all return to this room every twenty minutes
anybody gone longer than that
anybody trying to leave
we kill em
it is the dead of winter
six months of darkness ahead
palmer fights the cold as he works dismantling the engine of the helicopter
he frowns searching for something
mumbles wheres that magneto
cant find a darn thing around here any more
copper clark and garry sit moodily together on a couch
norris awkwardly prepares to give them their injections
he is new at this
childs stands guard with his torch
copper offers to help
ill do it
youre going to break the needle in my arm
hes doing a real fine job
macready and sanchez are foraging through the trash dump
look for shoes too
and burned cloth
norris has begun dismantling the radio
he rubs at his chest as he disengages the headset
following nauls as he skates through the labyrinth
checking waste bins
pausing to look behind shelves and any obscure hiding place
macready passes him coming the other way
that things too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes macready
just keep looking
fuchs is poring over a book
several others lie open on his desk
macready pokes his head in the lab
hows it going
but macready ive been thinking
if our dogs changed by swallowing parts of that other one
we better see to it that everyone prepares their own food and we eat out of cans
a siren goes off signaling the end of a twenty minute period
sanchez pulls himself out of the trash dump
palmer carries a large part of a helicopter engine toward the compound
the hallway near the supply storage cubicle
macready holds the door open as palmer makes his way to him lugging the heavy helicopter part
childs passes by from the other direction
childs wheres that magneto from chopper one
aint it there
he passes by
no it aint there
would i be asking if it were there
move it palmer
palmer sets down the heavy part
norris follows him inside with a bundle of radio gear
they move back out into the hallway
macready locks the door behind them
the three move down the hall toward their appointed rendezvous at the rec room
to palmer start taking apart those snowmobiles next huh
several of the men are preparing their food
heating them in pots
nauls wearily approaches blairs tool shed with a tray of food
he hears a pounding from within
i got your goodies superdude
he peeks in through the opening in the boarded up window
blair is nailing himself in from the inside
he looks pretty crazed
what you doin
nobodys getting in here
you can tell them all that
well who the hell you think wants to get in there with you
nauls slides the tray in the slot
it is immediately shoved back out and topples onto the ice
some of the food has splashed on nauls heavy coat
now whyd you go and
and i dont want any more food with sedatives in it
i know what youre up to
dont think i dont
and if anyone tries to get in here ive got rope
ill hang myself before it gets to me
nauls picks up the tray heads back mumbling
crazy white scientist motherfucker
palmer works on the snowmobile
sanchez resumes searching through the trash
macready slashes into the huge uninflated weather balloons rendering them useless
tanks of helium and hydrogen are stacked nearby
nauls does the dishes
his cassette plays in the b
childs continues guarding the three men
gotta go to the can childs
childs follows him to the other end of the room
clark walks to the head
childs moves back to the middle of the room
as the guard he is much more vulnerable in this position
being split between his prisoners
the lights begin to flicker
the soft purr of the generator begins to fade
the lights go out
nauls calls from the kitchen
that a fuse
you got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen
get to it
fumbling around wheres the damn flashlight
calling out you fellas okay over there
copper giggles in the dark
cut that out copper
whats taking you
im working it
thats impossible man
okay clark out of the john where i can see you
its shorted out or something
shouting clark you come on out here
childs lights the tip of his torch allowing him a strong candlelight
garry is no longer in the room
copper looks numbly at the empty seat next to him
childs finds the portable siren and blares it
macready palmer and sanchez heed the call and head for the compound
childs jerks his head around in different directions
where are you garry
dont you move an inch copper
shouts nauls bring me a goddamn flashlight
somebodys taken it
i cant find it
clark you want me to come in after you
macready sanchez and palmer come in from the outside
they bump into each other trying to get their bearings from the lack of light
palmer the only one who seems to have one turns on his flashlight
shouting whats happened
macready that you
its the generator i think
to palmer well lets get down there
to self oh shit
shouts well hang on
palmer and macready stumbling down the stairs
macready turns around looks
both look around
sanchez is gone
palmers light finds the motionless generator
he examines it
the fuel pump
frantic youve got to get up to supply mca
if we dont get this thing started soon itll freeze on us and well never get it going
macready dashes upstairs into the darkness
the lab door is opened
fuchs holding a small candle walks out
as he passes the shoulder of a man springs into frame
palmer is feverishly working underneath the generator on his back
the temperature continues to drop rapidly
childs swats himself to keep warm while still keeping an eye on dr
copper and the rest of the room
macready rushes out of the supply room with a fuel pump bumps into somebody
who is that
the silhouette moves on down the hallway
mac where the hell is that pump
macready holds the flashlight for palmer
their breath puffs of white smoke
somebody definitely messed with it
we going to make it
another ten fifteen minutes
what i dont get is
the sound of a screeching
from somewhere in the compound
the two mens faces locked in fear
the generator has been repaired the lights within the compound are back on
grim and tense
everyone is present but fuchs
eyes flit from man to man
palmer nauls and sanchez are spread out about the room keeping as much distance as possible from the rest
norris and childs are tying the doctor clark and garry to the couch
macready prepares several makeshift blowtorches as he kneels on the ground
where were the flashlights
screw the flashlights
where the hell were you
tons of stuffs been missing around here
magnetos cables wire
kitchen things too
anybody see fuchs
or hear him
no answer as the mens faces roam the room
childs glares at garry as he begins to tie him in
whered you go
garrys groggy features stare blankly
i said where
whered you go
find a light
you lying bastard
garry struggles to his feet affronted
slurring i rather dont like your tone
he grabs childs by the collar
you sit back down
childs whales on him with a right hand
both go tumbling over the couch
macready and norris dive in breaking it up
macready furious pulls childs away
norris breathing heavily from the activity massages his chest
the strong stormy winds overhead batter the roofing
macready glances up
he and childs release each other
that storms going to start ripping any minute so we dont have much time
he thrusts one of the blowtorches hard into childs stomach
weve got to find fuchs
when we find him we kill him
if hes one of those things weve got to get to him before he changes
nauls you and childs and ill check the outside shacks
he tosses torches to sanchez and palmer
sanchez you and palmer search the inside
i aint going with sanchez
sanchez snaps his head toward palmer
palmer looks at the others
i aint going with him
ill go with childs
well screw you man
i aint going with you
well who says i want you going with me
cut the bullshit
okay sanchez you come with us
you stay here
refers to tied up men any of them move you fry em
and if you hear anything anything at all you let loose the siren
we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless
a beat and everybody watch whoever youre with
the men survey each other
macready and nauls wearing their snowshoes and using flares for light pull themselves along the steadying rope that leads to blairs shed
they are careful to keep an eye on each other as they move along
sanchez heads off in the direction of another shack
one of the many doors creak open
childs and palmer stealthily move into the next corridor
palmer falls a few steps behind
whatd we ever do to these things anyway
childs freezes and snaps his head around facing palmer
dont walk behind me
he moves to the other side of the wall parallel with childs
they continue on skimming along the sides of the corridor in plain view of one another
nauls and macready arrive at blairs shack
they peer in through the spaces between the boards
a weak light burns as blair is seated eating out of a can
a hangmans noose dangles from the ceiling nearby
blair jumps in fear spilling his can
has fuchs been out here
blair approaches the boarded up window
he looks haggard and afraid
ive changed my mind
id like to come back inside
i dont want to stay out here any more
i hear funny things out here
have you come across fuchs
no its not fuchs
you must let me back in
i wont harm anyone
he and nauls trudges off
blair shouts after them
im much better now
ill be good
im all better
dont leave me here
norris continues his watch on the sedated trio
he anxiously tries to keep an eye on the various entrances behind and in front of him
he rubs his chest in pain
im getting worried about you
you ought to have a checkup
lets just not get worried about anything just now
yawning after all this mess then
nodding after all this mess
the winds are thick and vicious now
macready and nauls pull themselves along the rope fighting their way up the slope
a violent gust sends macreadys body horizontal but still hanging onto the rope
the wind slaps him back down
his flare and torch tumble back toward nauls
nauls saves the torch from rolling down the hill
macready lying vulnerable watches nauls pull his way toward him
nauls reaches him
he hands back his torch
relieved macready pulls himself upright
that line the wall
they have been torn apart
childs and palmer examine
auxiliary light cables
been pulled apart
as they reach the top
the remaining flare their only light
they stand on either side of the door
macready shoves it open
pitch black inside
macready flips the light switch
the place is a mess
the winds as strong as on the outside
the single flare illuminating the ceiling
almost all of the corrugated steel roofing is gone
as if ripped off
shouting to be heard wheres the roof
macready stares up incredulous as they advance through the room
this storm do that
shouting couldnt be possible
must have weighted a ton and a half
nauls kicks over a chair
a naked fleshy object bounds high into the air
nauls thrusts out his torch catching the breasts of the inflatable woman
she pops and is sucked out through the hole in the roof
nauls tries to catch his breath
goddamn white women
underground rickety corridor
palmer stands by as childs undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants
one by one
palmer twists his head in every which direction
childs pulls open the heavy door
a flush of snow and wind push them back
they wedge their bodies at the entrance to the lightless room
the light from the hall exposes the completely smashed in window high above the plants
the plants look frozen
somebody broke in
now whod go and do
saddened angry childs goes to check the damage to his plants
palmer his face set in horror yanks him back
let go of me
dont get near em
those things can imitate anything
whats it going to do being a plant
palmer readies his small torch
we got to burn em
now hold on you dumb
palmer sprays them with flame
childs pushes him to the ground and tries to swat out the fire
you stupid sonofa
palmer his mouth agape with terror screams and points to the closing door to their rear
one arm outstretched swings into view
an ax embedded deep into his chest pins his frozen body to the inside of the door
norris startled by the scream turns on the siren
sanchez has joined childs and palmer
the body of fuchs is still pinned to the door
sanchez tries to wrench the ax loose
it is too deeply embedded and wont budge
whoever put this through him
sanchez observes childs hulking frame and adds pointedly is one bad ass and strong muther
no ones that strong boy
tracking with the three men
opening and closing doors as they make their way back to the rec room
they keep their distance from each other watching each other while they walk
why didnt it imitate fuchs
isnt that its number to get more recruits
wasnt enough time
generator was out what
takes the bastards an hour maybe two to absorb somebody
he was working on a test
fuchs must have been onto something
these bastards got scared and got rid of him
suddenly realizing hey
shouting down a passageway
a strong driftwind streams snow across the ground obscuring everything but the very top of the buildings
the siren screams
rigid immobile faces
listening to the storm overhead
how long they been out now
forty five minutes
silence as the uneasy eyes measure one another
we better start closing off the outside hatchways
childs sanchez and palmer closing off and bolting the entrances to the camp
all of you
through the fogged up windows a figure can be seen approaching the main compound
it pulls and drags its way along the guide rope fighting the gale force winds
weapons in hand huddle at the main doorway
they unbolt it
sleet and hail send nauls rolling in from the outside
the men force the door back and lock it
the weary nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air
the others surround him
nauls weighs each of them ominously while digging down underneath his heavy jacket
cut him loose of the line up by his shack
cut him loose
when we were up poking around his place
i found this
he pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing
it is mutilated and partially burned
he holds out the jacket to show the inside collar
close on name tag it reads r
macready the men as they examine in a hush
it was stashed in his old coal furnace
wind must have dislodged it
i dont think he saw me find it
the men continue to examine in various states of disbelief
made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back
cut him loose
hes one of them
scared when do you think it got to him
could have been anytime
to nauls suspicious if it did get to him
when the lights went out
would have been a perfect time
garry was missing
pointedly and sanchez
goes for him fuck you palmer
childs and norris separate them
this is just what it wants
to pit us against each other
a pounding at the door sends the men jerking backward
nauls scampers to his feet
no answer as the men surround the door their weapons ready
open up its me macready
still nothing come on damn it
the towline snapped
been crawling around like a seal out here
harsh whisper bullshit
hes got to know damn well i cut it
the men keep their voices low
lets open it
shaking you think hes changed into one of those things
he hasnt had enough time
nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline
where is everybody
im half frostbit
lets open it
edgy hostile why you so damn anxious to let him in here
slightly trembling hes so close
maybe our best chance to blow him away
just let him freeze out there
voice cracking what if were wrong about him
then were wrong
the muffled breaking of a window down the hall
the men turn
the supply window
terror what we going to
weve got no choice now
macreadys voice is heard cursing as he appears to be stumbling around looking for a light switch
he responds to the muffled voices at the door
whats going on out there
palmer stands by as childs tries the knob
damn it hes got the keys
childs rips a nearby fire ax off the wall and begins hacking away at the door
what are you doing
youre a dead man macready or a dead whatever the hell you are
macready begins to rummage through the supplies in the darkness
we found your clothes the ones you tried to burn
you been made macready
childs chops away
macready desperately continues rummaging through the supplies
someones trying to mark me you bastard
trying to frame me
childs cautions to palmer as he prepares for one last blow
move in slow now
the door gives
the men move in
their blow torches ready
macready stands before them holding a lighted flare
his hair and clothing are covered with snow his cheeks and nose blackened by frostbite
tucked under his arm is an entire box of dynamite
he holds the flare dangerously close to the open box
anyone messes with me the whole camp goes
he appears to mean it
they dont seem anxious to test him
put those torches on the floor and back off
he follows them out into the hall
the men step backwards carefully
back way off
they heed retreating further down the hall
macready glances behind him
wheres the rest
nauls and norris who have silently crept in through the supply window come flying through the hacked up door and barrel into macready
both going straight for the flare
macready spins nauls off and rips into norris sending him crashing violently into the wall
nauls tackles macreadys legs pulling him to the floor
the others rush him
macready still in control of the dynamite and flare bellow so help me i mean it
they skid to a halt
nauls crawls away quickly
its cool man
we aint near you man
yeah man really
anybody touches me
norris lying on the floor coughs as if gasping for breath
he quivers for a moment and then is still
nauls crawls over to him and shakes him
i dont think hes breathing
nauls listens to norris chest
go untie the doc
get him in here
bring the others too
grins menacingly from now on no one gets out of my sight
norris body is plopped on the examination table
copper stumbles and is steadied by some of the men
macready continues to keep his distance
copper places an oxygen mask over norris face
he then rips open his shirt
so you sweethearts had yourselves a little trial
i just may have to kill you on general principle nauls
copper begins swathing norris chest with a gelatin substance
ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up
we aint buying that
damn it quit the bickering and give me a hand
wheel that fibrillator over here
sanchez pushes over the portable fibrillator
copper climbs up on the table and straddles norris chest
unnoticed clark paws the contents of the instrument tray behind his back
palmer turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face
childs grab his shoulders
they do so
copper holds electrical prongs over norris chest
to macready threatening youre going to have to sleep sometime
to sanchez turn that thing on
sanchez depresses the on button
now hold him
im a real light sleeper childs
copper presses the prongs onto norris chest and shoots a bolt of current
norris body heaves upward
a slight crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask
more current this time sanchez
several more jolts from the prongs
clarks hand has found a scalpel
he gently lifts it out bringing it to his side
and if anyone tries to wake me
damn you macready
norris body begins bounding up
more crackling and popping
his chest begins to break up and spread
the mask pops off a hideous mewing escaping from norris distorted mouth
the men jump back incredulous
copper scrambles off his chest and flops to the floor
they watch on in stunned horror as the thing that was norris begins to change to spread awkwardly on the slab
its clothes tearing
a shoe splits in half and falls to the floor exposing the beginnings of a talon
macready charges toward it shooing the men off
get out of the way
he unloads with a stream of flame
the body writhes in pain belching and hissing
the slab catches fire
it struggles lunges for the floor straightens up and moves a few feet
a black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and squirts to the floor
norris body collapses on the fibrillating machine in flames
extinguishers are ripped from the walls and put to work
macready watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination as they twitch and mew on the floor
within seconds the fire is out
the men stand around in awe as they look upon the thing that was once norris
macready continues to observe the small particles
their tiny squeals abating into silence
macready still carrying the industrial torch has maneuvered all the men into the room
he holds garrys
he has untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite
what you got in mind macready
a little test
what kind of test
im sure a lot of you already know
he tosses a ream of steel cable and some rope to palmer
palmer you and copper tie everyone down
for your health
to others lets rush him
hes not going to blow us all up
damn if i wont
a beat you aint tying me up
then ill have to kill you
then kill me
macready points the
at childs head
i mean it
macready cocks his gun
childs holds his ground
i guess you do
clark springs for macready
macready spins and fires three shots point blank the forces of the charges sending clark flying backwards
the others themselves about to pounce stop as macready whirls the torch and gun back toward them
being tied securely to couches and chairs
tie up clark too
bemused hes dead
norris looked pretty dead himself
bullets dont kill these things
macready turns on a bunsen burner while he cuts the rubber covering off an electrical cord exposing the copper wire
all the while he keeps his eye on the men
muttering we should have jumped his ass
now copper you tie palmer up
copper starts to tie palmer to the small couch next to childs and garry
were going to draw a little bit of everybodys blood
what are you going to do
watching norris in there
gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole
every piece of you is self sufficient an animal unto itself
when a man bleeds its just tissue
but blood from one of you things wont obey
its a newly formed individual with a built in desire to protect its own life
when attacked your blood will try and survive and crawl away from a hot needle say
grimacing as dr
copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and collects a small portion of his blood in a dish
all the men have been tied up
palmer childs and garry on the small couch
the others including the lifeless corpse of clark in chairs
copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in line with the other plates of blood that he has collected
the names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates
macready slides the doctor a fresh plate
copper cuts his thumb his blood dribbles onto the plate
he stands nervously for a beat
slide it back here
copper pushes it toward macready
now step way back
copper steps backward moisture beginning to collect on his brow
macready begins to heat the copper wire over the bunsen burner
the men watch intently
the wire begins to glow
macready points the torch directly at the doctor
both of them perspiring
macready lifts the glowing wire from the flame
the doctor is dead still
macready slowly touches the wire to the doctors plate
a soft hiss
macready heats it again and tries once more
the same soft hiss
macready and the doctor both let out a sigh
i guess youre okay
shaken facetious thank you
i didnt think youd use that fibrillator on norris if you were one of them
he hands copper the torch
he cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his own blood
now ill show you what i already know
he heats the wire and puts it to his plate
the same harmless hissing
all eyes continue to watch as he tries again
the same result
load of bullshit
lets try clark
he heats the wire and lays it in clarks dish
so clark was human huh
so that make you a murderer
macready glances over the group
he sets palmers plate in front of him and heats the wire
this wont prove a damn thing
thought youd feel that way garry
you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma
placing the wire in palmers dish well do you last
the blood howls trying to crawl off the plate
palmer bolts forward with incredible force racing for macready his face splitting his mouth roaring dragging the couch childs and garry with him
he smashes into macready knocking him over the table
its all happened too fast
copper tries to get off a burst of flame
the ever changing palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the doctor
the others sit helpless struggling at their bindings
macready dives on palmers back and the three go rolling to the floor
macready pounds viciously at palmers head
a powerful shirt splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor
copper momentarily has control of the torch
just as he positions it palmers mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the doctors head
the big torch slaps against the wall
palmer bounds to his feet wrapping his arms around the dangling struggling body of dr
the men are screaming hysterically
macready tries to fire up the bruised torch
frustrated he charges up behind palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head
the shirt of palmers back erupts in macreadys face
splitting and ripping wildly exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice
a blackened iron strong tongue lunges outward
stunned macready manages to elude it diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite
macready lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table
palmer awkwardly spins in circles swinging the doctors body like a propeller blade struggling to keep on balance as he advances on macready
the second orifice spitting and snarling as it continues to take form
macready waits until palmers back spins around facing him
only two yards away macready flings his lit roll into the ever evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering childs and garry with his body
a muffled boom as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room
macready rolls away from childs and garry as fast as he can
perspiring profusely his hand trembling slightly prepares to continue the test
he heats the wire
the men are pouring sweat white knuckled
one of the smaller torches is pointed at nauls
he closes his eyes
macready places the heated wire into his plate
nauls opens his eyes
macready unties nauls with one hand while the torch stays glued to the others
macready heats the wire once again
both he and nauls have torches aimed at sanchez
sanchez is near tears
the wire is dipped into the plate
sanchez breaks down and sobs
sits stoicly while he watches the preparations for his turn
lets do it bwana
nauls and sanchez take aim five yards away
the wire comes off the flame into the plate
the harmless hissing
the muscles in childs face melt into a sigh
snap towards station manager garry
childs suddenly realizing who he is sitting next to squirms
get me the hell away from
cut me loose damn it
nauls rips away his bindings
the other two stand guard
childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor
stares grimly ahead
childs soaks his clothing with a can of gasoline
he is then surrounded
the room tenses adrenalin pumps breathing halts
macready tries again
the men breathe
their torches are lowered
nauls throws his on the floor
sanchez and childs flop down in chairs
macready wipes his face
a long silence
sanchez weeps quietly with relief
i know you gentlemen have been through a lot
but when you find the time
id rather not spend the rest of the winter tied to this couch
childs starts to giggle
the strain on macreadys jaw begins to lessen
garry sits catatonic
nauls scowls at childs uncontrollable laughter
the infectious rasping causes macready a slight smile as he looks up taking comfort in the sound of the raging antarctic wind vibrating the roof
nauls untying garry grumbles at childs
shut the damn hell up
childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward macready
his smile fades macready is now stone faced
childs grin goes stale in sudden realization
almost a whisper blair
the wind rumbles
the storm is at its peak
macready childs and nauls guided by their flares pull themselves along the steadying rope headed for blairs shack
the door is wide open
they pause by the entrance trying to balance against the wind
a few of the floorboards are loosened
they pull them up
they stare down into a large hole beneath the planking
something is down there
they pull up more boards
the hole is some fifteen feet deep
its dimensions are the same as the shack
its space is almost completely taken up by some strange metallic object
crudely fashioned a patchwork job but streamlined
sheets of corrugated steel are visible but cut apart and welded into the desired shapes
the object appears to be unfinished
what is it
everything thats been missing
spaceship of some kind
he put it together piece by piece
where was he trying to go
anyplace but here
macready pulls out a dozen tightly wrapped sticks of dynamite
but he aint going to make it
far off amidst the howling gale the screeching
the men jump
macready lights the fuse as they make it to the exit
he tosses it in
the explosion echoes behind them
the men pull along
their heads jerk in circles searching into the blackness
some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down severing the line
the wind sends the men tumbling along the ice
childs loosens the line and is blown away rolling out of sight
macready and nauls have lost their torches
they pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound
the screeching closes in behind them
macready loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building
he crawls along looking for an opening
nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel
he climbs down through the open stairwell
macready has found the broken window
he rolls through it landing on the frozen plants below
something smashes at the glass above his head trying to get in
he sprints for the door
fuchs frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax
macready grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob
he finally gets it open and lets himself out slamming and locking the door from the hall
fuchs body swings eerily back and forth
macready charges up the stairs from the plant room
he zooms down the twisting corridors opening and closing doors
he rounds a bend and crashes into nauls coming the other way
pouring gasoline into empty bottles preparing molotov cocktails
garry is connecting an electrical device wires attached to two portable generators
macready appears to be injecting something into empty contact capsules
the men work feverishly
nauls rushes in with another box of dynamite
what about childs
forget about childs
nauls begins cutting the wicks off the dynamite
make em short
theyll go off quicker if we need to use them
the wind belts into the roofing overhead
garry sets the wiring to the main doorway
macready begins blocking off one of the other entrances with a large computer
what if it doesnt come
it needs us
were the only thing left to imitate
to sanchez give me a hand
they block off a door with two heavy electrical games
to sanchez you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks the mess hall and the kitchen
protest you crazy
he might be inside already
chance we got to take
we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged
nauls starts lacing his skates
he might just wait us out
im going to blow the generator when you get back
hell have to come for us or freeze
macready further barricades the door with small couch
weve got portable heaters well last longer
sanchez and nauls start to leave
he dispenses the capsules
we place them between our cheeks and gums
this thing cant imitate anything thats dead
a grim silence
if it gets a hold of you bite down
theyre supposed to be fast and painless
sanchez and nauls inch their way through
macready rips linen soaks the strips in gas and stuffs them in the molotov bottles
garry tests the current on the door
popping sparks smoke
one thousand volts
should be enough
nauls pushes a stove reinforcing a locked door
five yards away sanchez maneuvers the refrigerator in front of another outlet
sanchez hears a quiet purring bubbling sound
he turns to nauls
you hear that
they whip their attention to stereo speakers on either side of the kitchen
rock music screams out
the same loud music
macready and garry look to the three speakers attached to the walls
macready yells his incomprehension to garry
garry tries to respond
their voices drowned out
another of the stereo speakers that line the walls thunders
nauls in sudden realization screams over the din and points back in the direction they came
its got into the pub
its turned on the stereo
its in between us and them
how we going to get back
i cant hear you
macready cursing rips the speakers off the wall
what are they doing out there
the music is now subdued within the room but continues booming throughout the camp
nauls scream can be barely heard
whats he saying
at the top of his lungs
we been cut off
a sharp red talon like fingernail pierces the top of the door above nauls head
it saws downward quickly
black goo drips through the slit
the sawing obscured by the music
sanchez eyes bulging points
a claw rips through the wood
nauls dives to the floor
in the opposite direction behind sanchez another arm splits through the door and the refrigerator extends itself five feet and yanks sanchez back as if he were a puppet
sanchez struggles looking imploringly at nauls
he bites down on his capsule
nauls takes off like a speed skater
the sound of the screeching over the music
got to get to the generator
he opens the door
looks down the hall
the speakers blaring music
full speed down the maze
he hits a straightaway
from out of nowhere blasts through the hallway wall directly in nauls path
a thick arm pins the body to the other side
unable to stop nauls skids out of control banging into the sides of the wall his cyanide capsule flying out of his mouth
whatever the rest of it is it starts to crumble through the wall
nauls dives over the arm somersaults to his feet and takes off
macready running spots nauls careening out of a turn heading toward him
screw the generator
nauls blazes by him
macready hears the snarls and screeches heading his way
he streaks after nauls
they make it in
lock the door
macready tries to catch his breath
nauls shakes pants
world war three wouldnt mess with this fucker
can go through walls
and its like all over the place
calm down and get in your position
position my ass
garry fiddles with the two generators
im going to bump this up much as i can
boulder dam might do it
the loud music in the compound is turned off
macready shuts off the lights
the men spread out
the men watch all the doors
how longs it been
little over two hours
maybe it aint coming
then we go after him
bet the last place you ever go
the sound of a door opening and closing
another creaking door is opened
still far off
macready and nauls spread further apart
the soft bubbling cooling sound
a slight scratch at the door
garrys hand tightens around the generator switches
the scratching gets more pronounced
macready cautions garry with a whisper
the door begins to pound from the outside
nauls and macready light two cocktails each
the door booms
the rooms foundations shake
the ceiling quivers
the gas bombs are cocked
from the roof the thing roars down into their midst
stunned the men stumble back
macready throws his gas bomb
nauls the same
for a moment it stands silhouetted in flame
garry bolts for the main door
the things tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him
the good two thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs garry by the door
another leg slaps nauls to the ground
macready dodges still another appendage dives on the generators and throws the switch
the current rips through the door
garry dies instantly
one of the things talons still caught in the door sends it writhing in pain
it literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground trying to shake it loose
nauls hobbles scrambles out of the opening
macready dives through the window and out into the storm
the distant sound of a motor
nauls battered and bloodied his leg apparently broken crawls along the ground
another sound a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear
the terror forces him to drag faster oblivious to the pain
he reaches the bathroom stall
the gurgling nears
leaning on the toilet seat he looks about himself frantically
the presence pauses at the door
nauls paws rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood cutting his fingers as he tries to break it off the siding
a strong blow begins to breach the stall door
nauls finally unhinges the piece of wood brings the jagged end to one side of his throat and rips
the motorized rumbling nears
the wall seems to explode
the tractor barrels into the lab
its enormous shovel scooper tearing half the room to shreds
his eyes glint like a wild mans he looks stark raving mad
his frostbite now in an advanced stage resembles black war paint
he clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth like a buccaneers cutlass
two large compressed air tanks have been tied together at the top and are draped around his neck
they are marked hydrogen
they are used for the weather balloons
he pulls the tractor to a stop yanks the stick from his mouth grins and bellows
just you and me now
be on your toes
were going to do a little remodeling
macready guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary
medical equipment goes flying
the machine is powerful the prefabricated walls buckling under its force
a trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend
macready rams into the mess hall sweeping away tables chairs
he sings out loud the lyrics of some mexican song
all the while he keeps his eyes on everything
through the kitchen
the foundation is crumbling
he sings on
gurgling and hissing
a taloned arm slinks around a corner in retreat
chime in if you know that words old boy
plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub area
he backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from the bar
you like whiskey
come on join me for a drink
be good for you
grow fangs on your chest
he takes a drink and rams through another wall
the tractor blazes into the rec room
macready parks it directly in front of the hole in the roof created by the thing when it surprised them earlier
damn it ran out of gas
he pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor
as he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof to doorways to rubble
wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes stinging macready with the cold
he winces at his mittenless blackened fingers
sweetheart its going to get mighty cold in here soon
you better make your move
i mean hell im only one person
he takes a swig from his bottle
i know youre bugged because we ruined your trip right
spiffy little toy you had there
a slight tremor perks his eyes and ears
he looks up through the hole then around
he lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap
but your real hang up is your looks
a stronger tremor
the adrenalin pumps
wants him bad atta boy
i know youre around
the floor shakes
macready stands his head whirling around the room
come on sucker
the tractor inches up off the ground
macready falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below
a claw flashes up splitting the steering wheel but missing his face
he depresses the ignition bolting the tractor ten feet
he jumps hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling
the things face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor
the reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through
he lights his fuse drops in the stick turns and runs
half of the things grotesque and angular torso bolts up through the hole howling in fury
an appendage springs outward and winds around macreadys jacket hissing like acid into the fabric
an immense explosion
the hydrogen tanks send a white fireball fifty feet into the sky
the things body disintegrating almost immediately
the force of the blast sweeps macready off the roof
he and the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames
he rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off the insidious limb
one half of it burnt almost to the ground
macready wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud from his shoulders to the floor
he walks bent over and in much pain trying to blunt patches of fire with an extinguisher
it is futile
he gives up
mostly untouched by the fire but like most of the rest of the camp exposed to the outside
the storm has settled considerably
lighting a cigar
his hands are heavily wrapped
he pours himself a drink
a puffy white hand missing two fingers enters the frame and whirls a startled macready around
it is childs
white and black blotches cover his frostbitten face
did you kill it
he looks as weak as macready
i think so
what do you mean you think so
both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously
i got it
refers to childs condition pretty mean frostbite
childs steps back keeping his distance
he indicates his puffy white hand
itll turn black again soon enough
then i guess ill be losing the whole thing
refers to feet think my toes are already gone
macready carrying the bottle and glass limps over and sits down behind a gaming table
there is a chess set and several decks of cards
the two men continue to eye each other
so youre the only one who made it
macready begins setting up a non electronic chessboard
not the only one
the fires got the temperature way up all over camp
wont last long though
neither will we
maybe we should try and fix the radio
try and get some help
maybe we shouldnt
then well never make it
macready puffs on his cigar
he reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top
maybe we shouldnt make it
beat if youre worried about anything lets take that blood test of yours
if weve got any surprises for each other we shouldnt be in any condition to do anything about it
beat you play chess
they regard each other for a moment
childs painfully sits down across from macready
i guess ill be learning
macready grins and hands the bottle to childs
childs smiles back and takes a healthy swig
the fires smolder on
bright embers dance in the blackness pushed by the soughing wind
