written by chris sparling darkness
after a long beat we hear movement confined and contained
we then hear the sound of a man paul conroy groaning making confused attempts at words
we hear his movement short abrupt shifting ending almost immediately with the sound of his body banging against wood
he screams though its clear from the sound that his mouth is covered by something
after attempting to sit up he immediately bangs his head against something
its terribly warm and his breaths are labored
he attempts to move to his left and right only to find that he is confined on those sides as well
he frantically shifts about only to discover by touch that he is encased in something
something is very wrong and he doesnt need to see to know that
finally we see him lit by the flame of the zippo he holds in his hands which are bound together in front of him with rope
a rolled up dirty rag is tied tightly around his head stretched across his mouth
dried blood stains his hair and forehead
we see that he is lying in an old fashioned wooden coffin
nothing more than a few rotted out planks of wood nailed together
realizing the same paul is struck by an overwhelming instant panic
with great difficulty and while still holding the lit zippo paul removes the muzzle from his mouth
what is this
his words become almost unintelligible as he flails about though fear is understood in his every utterance
he screams aloud but his voice is captured by the coffin walls
oh my god
he kicks and slams his hands against the top and sides of the coffin all to no avail
his violent movements cause small grains of sand to trickle in through the space between the sides and top of the coffin as well as a small gap that exists
between one of the coffins broken wooden planks
sweat cascades down the side of his neck dripping from his dampened brow
the heat inside the extremely close confines of the coffin is stifling
somebody help me
paul continues with his futile efforts to pry off the top of the coffin
the sides the top the bottom all are too thoroughly reinforced by the force of what surrounds the coffin
it becomes clear to him that he is buried
he tries his best to calm himself though he has trouble catching his breath
it takes him some time but he eventually achieves some semblance of calm
getting a good look at him for the first time we see that paul is somewhere around years old
unshaven and physically unremarkable he embodies the blue collar american everyman
the minimal amount of oxygen in the coffin makes it hard for him to breathe
his eyes widen a bit upon seeing an exposed rusty nail
he tries desperately to use the nail to cut through the old frayed ropes that bind his hands
doing so is no easy task
the incredibly tight quarters makes his every action nearly impossible
after a lengthy struggle the rope snaps
paul quickly frees his hands
a small victory
the heat is unbearable
paul takes off his button down shirt leaving him in a t shirt
his body battles against the walls and the ceiling of the coffin with every move he makes
he tosses his button down shirt down by his feet
his undershirt is drenched through with sweat
still trying to calm himself but having little success in doing so paul looks around the coffin
his feet though only his body length away seem miles from him
he looks at the top of the coffin and then back at his feet
with great difficulty he shifts his body so that his feet are pressed against the top of the coffin
he attempts to use his leg strength to push the top off of him but it doesnt move even a millimeter
after several failed attempts and with his legs exhausted paul drops his feet from the top of the coffin
he lay for a moment in silence followed by an outburst of crying
close to his head on the corner of the floor we see theres another broken plank
a small hole
he closes his cigarette lighter extinguishing the flame
in total darkness he continues to cry
what is this
with his sobbing slowly subsiding the coffin soon grows eerily silent
the sound of pauls labored breaths are all we hear softened under the blanket of absolute darkness
after a beat the silence is interrupted by a subtle buzzing sound
the muted sight of strange blueish light flickers in the coffin by pauls feet
he is extremely startled
the buzzing continues as does the minimal splashing of light
its coming from underneath his discarded button down shirt down near his feet
he lights the zippo to get a better look
pulling the shirt away he realizes that what he is hearing and seeing is the vibrating ring and display features of an older model cell phone
he frantically reaches for it though the coffin is far too small for him to reposition himself so easily
to his dismay the phone stops ringing
but his efforts to reach it continue
he uses his feet to search for the phone
after some trouble finding it he eventually locates it
clamping the phone together between his clasped feet paul then painfully angles his body so that he can reach his feet with his hands and grab it
he is soon able to reach it
immediately thereafter he flips open the phone and puts the receiver in front of him
we see that there is a text message waiting for paul on the phone
however paul barely notices
the time on the phone reads pm
while the numbers and display screen icons are familiar to americans all the words are in arabic
what he does notices is that the phone barely has one bar of signal strength
worse yet there is only half of the battery life remaining
he tries to remember the safe number he was given
with the phone open and ready to be dialed paul struggles to recall the information
come on come on
what was it
getting only two digits into dialing the number he cannot remember much more and closes the phone
he wedges the lit zippo into sand which is compacted against a small hole in the wall of the coffin
paul reaches into his pants pocket frantically searching for something
he hastily removes a prescription pill bottle and a small metal flask
both are not what he was looking for
he then reaches to his back pocket and removes his wallet
his license his credit cards his cash and most importantly at that very moment a piece of paper with the safe number written on it are all missing
where the hell is it
son of a
he screams aloud again hoping greatly that someone can hear him
his frenzied maneuvering puts out the flame of the zippo
somebody help me
his words barely make it pass the coffin walls
with the cell phone still in hand and laboring to reclaim the breath he just expended paul turns to desperation
he dials the international code of and then dials
a female operator answers almost immediately
the female operator places paul on hold
paul accidentally bangs the cap of the zippo against the coffin wall putting out the flame
she quickly returns
what is your emergency
whats the problem sir
paul is so incredibly panicked that he has trouble remaining coherent
after a few sparks the zippo is re lit
you have to help me

im not sure exactly how you called here if youre in another country but if youd like i can patch you through to the sheriffs department
you dont underst
realizing that his conversation is both lengthy and useless paul ends the call
he checks the battery life on the phone
it still holds steady at two bars
he immediately dials another number one that he can recall with ease
he again enters the international code before making the call
paul then dials his home phone
it rings several times so far unanswered
come on come on
after sitting through the agony of a few more rings paul is met with the answering machine
the voice of his young son shane is heard on the answering machine greeting
thanks for calling the conroys
were not home right now
please leave a message at the beep
at the sound of the beep paul leaves a frenzied rambling message
linda honey its me
listen i need you to contact the national guard right away
or the pentagon
tell them we were attacked in the diyala provence in baqubah
they have to find me
please help me baby
please help them find me
paul hangs up
he dials his wifes cell phone right away
after several rings her cell phone voice mail picks up
we hear the sound of linda pauls wife on her outgoing message
hi this is linda
please leave a message
thanks and have a great day
the beep sounds and paul immediately tears into his voice message
linda its paul
i need you to call me right away
this is an absolute emergency
call the number that comes up on your phone
call me at that number
if i dont answer call the pentagon or the f
i dont know what the hell is going on but im buried in a box
hearing himself say those last words gives him pause
the gravity of the situation fully takes hold
i cant breathe in here
make sure you call me right away
please baby please call me
paul ends the call
he nervously looks at the amount of battery life remaining on the phone
still holding strong at two bars
he notices the flickering light of the zippo
it too appears to be using up small amounts of oxygen
he closes the lid extinguishing the flame
silence save for pauls increasingly heavy breaths
he begins to hyperventilate
he knows that preserving oxygen is paramount so he does his best to calm himself
the healthy swig he takes from his flask helps
he flips open the cell phone
the light of the display screen partially illuminates his face and some of the coffin with a blueish hue
paul again enters the overseas dialing code this time dialing information
the operator answers
what city and state please
i dont know
wherever they are
paul reaches for his button down shirt
fishes for pens stashed in his lapel pocket while keeping the phone pressed to his ear with his shoulder
do you have a specific city youd like to be connected to sir
i dont care any city
just connect me to the f
sir i have f
field offices listed in boston new york philadelphia new haven los angeles chicago denver paul cannot bear to listen any further to this list that seemingly never ends
any city just connect me please
im sorry sir but im not allowed to do that
please hold for your number
paul is transferred to an automated message
the number you requested
paul writes the digits of the phone number on the top of the coffin with his pen
but after the first three numbers the pen stops working
he hurriedly reaches back into his shirt pocket to remove the other pen which is actually a click up pencil
click click click click
he writes the last seven digits followed by the word fbi
can be connected for an additional charge of twenty five cents by pressing the number one
he presses the number one and is connected directly
after a few rings special agent harris answers
chicago field office
special agent harris
is this the f
yes it is sir
im calling from iraq
im buried in the desert somewhere
i need you to help me whoa whoa sir
when were you in iraq
im there now
im a truck driver for crt
ive been here for nine months
may i have your name please sir
saying it as he writes it paul conroy
back on the phone okay paul explain to me whats going on
paul attempts to center himself so that he can accurately tell his story
me and a convoy of other drivers were delivering kitchen parts to a community center
as we got closer a bunch of kids started throwing rocks at our trucks
then an ied went off up ahead and blew up one of the other trucks
these guys came out from behind the houses with guns and started shooting everybody right there on the street
were you shot at
i dont know
after a breath calmer i dont know
i was way in the back of the convoy
i must have got hit in the head with one of the rocks and got knocked out
thats the last thing i remember
but now i just woke up and i was tied up and buried in a coffin
who put you there
i guess whoever ambushed us
special agent harris sounds slightly skeptical of pauls claims
a bunch of kids
no youre not listening
the kids threw the rocks at us but then some iraqi guys maybe insurgents i dont fucking know popped out of nowhere and started shooting at us
i thought you said they didnt shoot at you
they didnt i dont know
but they shot them
sir youre going to have to stop shouting if im shouting because youre not listening
i need you to help me
paul takes a moment to center himself
can you trace my call
gps or something
why is it that they didnt shoot you
i have no idea
they didnt thats all i know
whats your social security number paul
im buried in the middle of the fucking desert
who cares what my social security number is
im an american citizen
just send someone to find me
do you know where youre lo
the cell phone starts breaking up
i cant hear you
suddenly special agent harris is not heard at all
paul checks the phones display where he sees that the call has been lost
cell phone service temporarily goes down
paul lights the zippo to help him see the cell phone screen
he tries to make a call but nothing happens
he shakes the phone moves it around the coffin all in desperate hope that he will get a signal
he soon does
he looks at the number for the f
that he has written on the wall thinking about calling them back
he then checks the battery life on his phone which remains at two bars
paul then decides to make a different call this time to a phone number he has committed to memory his employer back in the u
crestin roland and thomas crt
he closes the lid of the zippo extinguishing the flame
after a few rings a crt operator answers
thank you for calling crestin roland and thomas
how may i direct your call
somebody i need to talk to someone right away
its an emergency
who is this please
im a driver for you guys
im calling from iraq
my convoy was attacked

they took it
who took it sir
the iraqis i think
i dont remember i blacked out
im going to put you through to alan davenport
director of personnel
no i need to talk paul is placed on hold
synthesized soft rock plays in the background of the phone maddening paul further
over the music a crt spokesman is heard speaking a recorded testimonial during the on hold message
at crt we work with our clients to provide effective and sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in our fast growing global economy
as the premiere
the message is interrupted by alan davenports outgoing voice message
youve reached alan davenport personnel director at crestin roland and thomas
please leave your name and number at the tone and i will return your call as soon as possible
the beep sounds
paul is confused as to why he was patched through to someone in human resources but leaves a message nevertheless
this is paul conroy im from hastings michigan
im a driver for crt and my convoy was ambushed
by insurgents or terrorists
i dont know
i dont know who it was
im stuck in the ground buried in a coffin and i need help
please send help
im begging you
i think im in baqubah in the diyala provence
please send help right away
i cant breathe in here
im begging you
i dont know who else to call
paul notices that his phone has again lost signal
paul drops the phone to his side the screen still emitting its glow
he explodes with a mixture of rage and fear
he screams and flails his feet and hands wildly banging them against the walls of the coffin
his animalistic outburst causes the phone to close
the coffin returns to pitch black
after a long beat paul lights the zippo which remains wedged in the sand compacted against the small hole in the wall of the coffin
paul takes a few moments to catch his breath
he looks again at the cell phone
remembers receiving a text message
the icon on the phones display indicates that he does in fact have an unread text message waiting for him
paul quickly scrolls through the phones menu which is all written in arabic until he reaches what appears to be the text message option
opening it he sees a series of ten numbers
using his click up pencil he scribbles the numbers onto the top of the coffin
next to the number he writes the word help
noticing that his phone has again picked up a signal he dials the number
it rings once but then the reception begins to falter
after only two rings the call is ended
pauls frustration mounts
he is barely able to fight off another fit of hysterics
he dials the number again
it rings once
a second ring
in the middle of the third ring someone answers but they do not say anything
is anyone there
after a beat paul hears breathing on the other end of the phone
he also hears a discordance of background sound the din of a room filled with arabic speaking men
who are you
please you have to help me
still pauls words are only met with slow measured breaths
who is this
the person on the other end eventually speaks
an iraqi man jabir talks forcefully and aggressively in broken english
breathe no breathe american
breathe no breathe
i dont know what youre saying
who is this
american can breathe no breathe
no i cant breathe
please get me out of here
yes please get me out
no no im not a soldier
im a truck driver
im not a soldier
im a contractor
yes thats right
not a soldier
no not for blackwater
im not a security contractor
truck driver im a truck driver
you are american
then you are soldier
despair falls upon paul
it becomes clear that jabir is responsible for all of this
as such paul crosses out the word help
closes the lid of the zippo leaving only the cell phone display screen to illuminate his face
no im not
im here unarmed
but you still shot at us
in head and in throat so you tell no more lies
im not lying
we were all drivers
the big trucks you see driving around with the supplies
were not soldiers
five million money
five million money tonight by nine pm or you stay
buried like dog
five million dollars
my family doesnt have five million dollars
if they did i wouldnt be here
i dont know yes the embassy will pay you
if you let me go theyll pay you the money
silence on the other end of the phone
after a long beat nine pm five million money
jabir hangs up the phone forcing paul to instantly come to grips with the fact that he is being held hostage
he lays back in the coffin shell shocked
physically spent the cell phone falls from his hands and onto the floor
the display screen casts a dim light throughout the coffin
the zippo lights
paul holds it in his hand using it to illuminate the inside of the coffin
he attempts to push it into its now customary resting place but the sand has loosened making it difficult for the zippo to stay in place
it almost falls to the floor
looking around paul sees there is a crack between two planks located on the opposite wall of the coffin
he wedges the lit zippo into the crack
with his hands now free paul haphazardly positions himself so that his back is facing the top of the coffin
his every move is arduous the claustrophobic nature of the coffin bearing down on him
paul positions his bent knees underneath his chest with his shins and feet pressed against the bottom of the coffin
using the strength of his legs he attempts to lift the top off the coffin with his back
trickles of sand fall in from the side of the coffin sprinkling against the wooden base
he fails only to immediately try again
exhaustion sets in
staring ahead the phone sits in front of him
he notices that the battery life bars are still at one solid and one blinking
he grabs the cell phone staring at it trying to think of someone else to call
the battery life is limited
every call has to count
he tries to remember some phone numbers but has trouble recalling the information
come on whats her number
he cannot remember the number hes thinking of
he notices that the flame of the zippo flickers indicating its use of his much needed oxygen
paul closes the lid extinguishing the flame
a second later we see him lit by the cell phone display screen
he dials the international code for the united states followed by information
a male operator answers
what city and listing please
im looking for donna mitchell
i have two donna mitchells sir
one on federal road and one on ardmore avenue
shit i dont know
just give me that one
yes ardmore avenue
please hold for your number
paul is switched to an automated message
the number you requested can automatically be dialed for a charge of twenty five cents by pressing the number one
paul writes donnas number and name on the top of the coffin and then presses the number one
he is connected
her phone rings and rings
pauls frustration is evident
where the hell is everyone
the phone rings some more
paul checks the battery life still at one and a half bars
donna eventually answers
hearing her voice paul hurriedly places the phone to his ear
donna its paul
hey hows it going
shes not answering her phone
i need to talk to her ive been taken hostage by
we realize as does paul that her voice was actually coming from her answering machine
im not really home
but if you leave a message ill get back to you as soon as i get in
his hand falls to his forehead defeated
donna i need to talk to linda
its an absolute emergency
have her call me
use star sixty nine and find out the number im calling from and have her call me
donna picks up the phone
what do you want
i need to talk to linda
where is she
i dont know
i havent talked to her all day
call her cell phone
are you near a computer or something
turn it on
it is on
look up the number for the state department for me
i was just heading out to the supermarket
i really dont have donna please please please just get me the number
is everything alright
everything is not alright
so please just look up the number
dont fucking yell at me paul
im not yelling
yes you are
just like you did last year at the cookout
im not going to tolerate just get me the fucking number
get me the number get me the number
donna hangs up on him
realizing this paul bangs his fists and claws at the top of the coffin bloodying some of his fingers and knuckles in the process
he violently tosses and turns and screams at the top of his lungs like an animal trapped in a cage
tears spray from his eyes as spit shakes free from his mouth by the force of his shudder
he eventually calms quite a bit
sniffing away tears and taking notice of the damage hes done to his hands paul slows his breathing as best he can
he lies there motionless
the silence is almost comforting
paul closes his eyes regretfully accepting what appears will be his inescapable fate
after a beat he calls donna back
knowing it is paul calling she answers right away attitude at the ready
it takes every ounce of pauls being to keep himself from going off the deep end
he takes a beat to compose himself and then finally offers a very delicate and deliberate response
donna im very sorry i yelled
but im only going to ask you once more to get me this number
if you dont get me this number im going to die
i dont have time to explain
we hear donna put down the phone
in the b
we hear the sound of keys being pressed on a computer keyboard
after a beat she picks the phone back up
paul writes the number on the top of the coffin beneath the man others
he writes the initials s
next to it
what the hells going paul hangs up on donna mid sentence
he dials the number the state department right away
a state department rep answers after a few rings
united states department of state
im an american citizen working in iraq
ive been taken hostage
i need to speak to someone right away
where are you calling from sir
im a truck driver for crt crestin roland and thomas
we were attacked and now im being held for ransom
are the kidnappers with you
im buried somewhere
yeah in a coffin a wooden box
its an old coffin i think
did you try contacting the military out there
i dont have the number
i was given a number to call a safety number
but the people took it
the people holding you hostage
i dont know
let me connect you
paul is placed on hold
as he waits his eyes wander around the coffin
he looks at the numbers he has written
after a moment rebecca browning a state department official picks up the phone
i was just informed of your situation
yeah my situation
im running out of time and you people keep putting me on hold
what the hell is wrong with you
dont be sorry
just help me
i just have a few questions for you mister conroy
youve got to be kidding me
its important that i get this information
it will make a rescue
wait wait wait
how did you know my name
i never gave you my name
i dont think i gave it to the other guy either
rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone
what the hell is going on right now
after a beat we received a call from a representative at crt
you left him a message
he contacted us right away
well since you know what the hell is going on what have you done to get me out of here
theres little we can do from washington
so thats it
im just supposed to rot in here because theres little you can do
i need to know where you were when your convoy was ambushed
in the diyala provence
and has contact been made with the kidnappers
the guy told me that he wants five million dollars by nine oclock tonight
or else hell bring me to sea world
what do you think lady
even faced with pauls sarcasm rebecca remains stolid
well do everything we can
so youll pay them
that we cant do
its the policy of the united states government to not negotiate with terrorists
to hell with that
its easy for you to worry about policy youre sitting in an air conditioned office somewhere probably finishing up your sandwich from lunch
youre not the one stuck in a coffin buried in the god damn desert
i understand your frustration
lady im going to fucking die in here
rebecca is silent on the other end of the phone
paul wonders if she is still there
the idea of being alone again scares him terribly
worried paul lights the zippo
the reflection of the flame dances on his frightened eyes
after a beat well then say something
tell me how youre going to get me out of here
whats the number on the phone youre calling from
i dont know
did it come up on your end
its listed as unavailable
do this take down this number
paul takes out his pen
paul writes the number onto the top of the coffin
hes the commander of the hostage working group over in iraq
paul writes d
brenner next to dans phone number
hostage working group
we formed it in to deal with situations such as yours
paul shakes his head in disgust
i love how you keep calling it that
did you write down the number
hold on ill connect you with him now
he should be expecting you
what about the news
im going to call them
do not i repeat do not contact the news
it will only complicate things further and threaten your chances of rescue
paul doesnt buy it
youre just covering your ass
no im covering yours
everyone who needs to know about this does
you dont go looking for something if you dont know its missing
thats why you need to contact dan brenner right away
paul still contemplates contacting the news but soon acquiesces to rebeccas pleas for him not to
im transferring you now
several beeps sound as hes being transferred
paul hears a faint sound coming from behind him outside the coffin
while the beeps continue to sound he lights the zippo circumspectly looking behind him
he doesnt see anything
with the zippo still lit paul takes a deep centering breath followed by another
a few more long beeps pass before a ring is heard
after two rings dan brenner answers
dan is quick to figure out who it is that must be calling him
is this paul conroy
yes yes its me
paul i was informed of whats going on
i want you to know that were already working on trying to get you out of there
paul is relieved
his first glint of hope has appeared
tears of joy instantly escape his eyes
oh thank you god
i was told that we have until pm
is that right
thats what he said
that doesnt give us a whole lot of time
and just so i have this right the kidnappers buried you in the ground
yeah in an old wooden coffin
my guess is that since youre able to get a cell signal youre no more than a few feet underground
i dont know
what about battery life
how much does the phone have left
paul looks at the display to find out
less than half
you have to conserve that battery
our best bet of finding you is by tracking your cell signal
is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate
press and hold down the asterisk key to change it to a ring tone
it will use less power
what about my zippo
you have a lighter
use it to look around for markings a logo whatever you can find
wont it use up oxygen
dont worry about that now
try to find its really dark in here without it
i understand paul
try to find anything in there that might indicate where that coffin was made
you guys have to hurry
were working as fast as we can paul
do you know if there were any other survivors
from your convoy
thats still unclear at this point
i just wanted to do right by my family
i didnt know it was going to be like this over here
i dont think any of us did
while on the phone with brenner paul gets another call coming in
he checks the display and reads the number
matching it against a number he wrote on the top of the coffin he sees that is jabir calling
what do i do
you know his number
give it to me
what about the call
give me the number first
the phone has rung several times
paul fears that jabir may hang up
hes going to hang up
take the call
take the call
paul complies with dans demand and switches to the other line
two hour six minute
paul looks at his watch
indeed he has but two hours and six minutes until the time reaches pm
you have to give me more time
you talk to embassy
they give money
i talked to
they said that they wont pay the money
they said that they dont negotiate with terrorists
i am terrorist
you are terrorist you son of a bitch
you are terrified so i am terrorist
what did i ever do to you
im here because its a job to make money
i have job until you come
now my family have nothing
thats not my fault
jabir retorts with a spirited conviction similar to pauls
nine one one was not my fault but still you are here
saddam was not my fault but still you are here
i told you im only here to work
to help rebuild
rebuild what you destroyed
paul cannot handle his stress any longer
he begins to crumble under the pressure
just please stop
im just a guy
im just a truck driver
im nobody that makes decisions about anything
i just want to go home
silence from the other end of the phone for an extended period of time
you make video ransom video
this surprisingly comes as good news to paul
get me out of here and ill make the video
you make video now
you use video on phone
pauls hopes are dashed
his sanguine head falls back onto the coffin floor
you read note near foot in box
paul shines the flame of his zippo lighter toward his feet
he doesnt see anything
i dont see near foot
read note inside box
paul repositions his legs as best he can
he can vaguely see the corner of a small metal box partially sticking out of a broken plank on the bottom of the coffin
if i make it will you let me go
only if we get money
nobodys going to pay five million dollars for me
we take less
one million money
if they pay it will you let me go
after a beat one million money
jabir hangs up ending the call
paul sits motionless for a moment soaking in all that jabir has just told him
he again looks down toward his feet
he can see the protruding corner of the metal box but its positioned in such a way that it will clearly not be easy for him to reach it
paul then tries to clasp the box with his feet but after several unsuccessful attempts he realizes that a new strategy is necessary
he makes efforts to reposition himself in the coffin so that his head and feet will ultimately switch places
he struggles inch by troubled inch to make this maneuver
sweat pours down the side of his face
the extremely tight quarters of the coffin make the repositioning nearly impossible
after expending a great deal of energy doing so paul eventually completes the turn of his body
he examines the small rusted metal box
on it is a cartoon picture of a small arab boy and girl playing with a red rubber ball
skeptical at first paul carefully examines the box and shakes it gently
items are heard rummaging inside
he carefully opens it
a fluorescent green light shines from inside
paul looks inside and finds a lit green glow stick fluorescing brightly and now illuminating much of the coffin
he closes the lid of the zippo
removes the stick
looking into the small box again he finds several other items a small disused flashlight a second unlit glow stick a jackknife and lastly a folded piece of paper
he slowly unfolds the piece of paper
we see that his ransom message is written in an unintelligible mix of english and arabic
paul shakes his head and lets out a sigh of disgust
he crumbles up the paper into a ball and listlessly drops it to his side
he covers his face with his hands his labored breaths echoing in his palms
under the low light of the green glow stick paul picks up the phone and dials his home
per usual he gets the answering machine
his son shane is heard on outgoing message
thanks for calling the conroys
were not home right now
please leave a message at the beep
pauls eyes well up with tears
he smiles at the sound of his sons voice
the beep is heard
paul hangs up without leaving a message
he looks at the time
battery life is holding steady at one and a half bars
he remembers something
paul presses and holds down the shortcut button on the phone that changes the ringer from vibrate to an audible tone
the glow stick begins to slowly fade
paul dials dan brenner
after a few rings dan answers
heres his number
paul presses the green key bringing up the last numbers dialed and received
alright go ahead
dan says something to someone who is in the room with him and then returns his attention to paul
this is huge
unless theyre using a cloned line we should be able to find where this is coming from in minutes
what about me
can you track my cell signal
were having a lot of trouble with yours
seems to be an eds line probably through one of the egyptian carriers
what does that mean
its not going to be easy
he wants me to make a ransom video
hold off for as long as you can
if its going to get me out of here im making it
the last thing we want is for this to end up all over al jazeera
paul becomes angry again sensing that more emphasis is being placed on containing the situation than rescuing him
this cant turn into an international incident
thats all you people care about
but what about me
dont you care about me
thats why were no you dont
you people dont care about any of us
ive had eight friends killed out here six of them today
we dont have any guns any armor
youre not soldiers
tell that to the people who put me in this box
tell that to the people who shot my friends
were doing the best we can
no youre not
all you people understand are your secret plans and your back room politics
if i were some diplomat or something maybe even a hostage working group leader or whatever your fancy title is id be out of here by now
but im not so im just supposed to keep my mouth shut and die
i need you to stay focused paul
dans heard enough
paul listen to me finding you is our primary concern
and were searching just as hard as we would be for a four star general so dont literally waste your breath suggesting otherwise
paul does not respond at first
dans retort clearly has an effect on him
who are they
the people who put me here
theyre just that people
no different from you and me
im no terrorist
neither are they
how do you know that
if you were homeless starving
actually i take that back
if your family was homeless and starving what would you do for them
i wouldnt kill someone
how can you be sure
what difference does it make
theyre criminals desperate ones at that
they dont care about anything other than getting the money
so pay them then
trust me if it was an option i would do that in a heartbeat
how many others have there been
since i got here
journalists contractors soldiers
hundreds have been taken
its one of the only functioning businesses out here
how many have you rescued
dan is reluctant to answer the question
tell me their names
any of them
make me know they really do matter to you
who was mark white
a kid from new hampshire
twenty six years old
came over here to help out local doctors
what happened to him
insurgents grabbed him
about three weeks ago
paul writes mark white on the top of the coffin below the list of phone numbers
he circles the name
you remember his name
i remember all their names
afraid to ask did he
the glow stick begins to fade
yeah paul hes alive
hearing this affords paul some semblance of relief
paul shakes the glow stick returning it to its full strength
where is he
probably happy to be back at school
i want to get out of here
we found him well find you too
we already have a solid lead on the number you gave us
a units on its way over there now
this news calms pauls nerves
what should i do in the meantime
i know its hard but try to relax
the more worked up you are the more air youre going to use
i cant help it
im always anxious
i take pills for it
do you have them with you
paul checks his pants pockets
he removes a small orange pill bottle
you need to preserve your oxygen level any way you can
is your zippo still lit
i feel nauseous
you have to calm down
and you need to save that battery
were expecting some intel in about ten minutes
call me back then
just hang in there paul
the glow stick begins to slowly fade
paul shakes it causing it to brighten only momentarily before dimming again
dan ends the call
paul lets out a deep breath finding it difficult to lay claim to its replacement
he looks at his watch
its now pm
the ticking sound of the second hand turning is inordinately loud due to the extreme silence of the coffin
just then the cell phone rings
checking the number on the display paul sees that it is jabir
did you make video
jabir yells something in arabic to the other iraqi men we hear in the background
collectively they do not sound pleased
slightly panicked in fact though it is difficult to tell for sure
you make video
let me out and ill make it
you make video now
i cant read the paper
make video now
i dont know what you want me to say
i cant read the paper
jabir is heard speaking with the men we hear arguing in the background
although they speak in arabic it is clear from their tone that they are becoming worried and increasingly hostile
jabir returns his attention back to paul
you make video now
jabir ends the call
paul closes the phone to help conserve battery life
he then reopens the phone and scrolls through the menu options
everything is written in arabic
he eventually comes across an icon with a movie camera the video function
he turns it on
looks at himself though the viewfinder
after a beat he closes the phone clearly frustrated and growing more panicked
his breaths grow heavy and rapid utilizing a great deal of oxygen
im never getting out of here
paul begins to freak out restlessly squirming inside the coffin and pressing against the sides and top
the glow stick fades out almost completely offering very little light
paul shakes it but with no change to its brightness
moments later it dies
paul tries the flashlight
he bangs it a few times with his hand
the white light turns on but quickly turns back off
he twists the top which causes the flashlight to switch bulbs
a red beam emits momentarily
paul twists the top again and gives the flashlight a few good whacks
it turns on
white light shines dimly on his face
he takes a breath
in efforts to calm himself he once again removes the orange pill bottle from his pocket
he pours two into his hand
he then removes his small metal alcohol flask from his back pocket and takes a large swig swallowing the two pills in the process
still pauls heavy labored breathing continues
he drops four additional pills into his and swallows them with yet another generous pull from the flask
he sits and waits
nothing is happening except that his extremely limited time keeps passing
after a moment paul picks up the cell phone
he holds it in front of him hesitant to make a call
after some consideration he dials
after a few rings a nursing home nurse answers
mountain view nursing home
i was hoping i could speak with maryanne conroy please
let me bring the cordless phone to her room
hold on a moment please
we hear the nurse walk down the tiled corridor floor
she soon reaches pauls mothers room
misses conroy you have a telephone call dear
here you can use this phone
pauls mother maryanne answers
her voice is pleasant but confused
its clear that she suffers from advanced stages of alzheimers disease
its paul mom
its okay mom
how are you
who are you
its your son mom
we lived over on colfax street in the duplex
thats right mom
is this paulie
it is mom
hows everything at the home
your father and i have been playing gin rummy every night
its almost too much for paul to take
he cries silent tears over a heartbroken smile
i dont think pops there with you mom
how are you doing sweetie
not very good
uh this may be the last time i talk to you
thats nice honey
did you get the flowers i sent a few months ago
yeah i sent
im going to go now
i just wanted to talk to you you know just to say bye
i love you mom
maryanne doesnt respond
did you hear me
i told you
do you want to tell me you yes dear
your father and i have been playing gin rummy every night
after a beat okay mom
tell pop i said hi
paul ends the call and instantly begins crying his heart out
he lays there sobbing relentlessly
after a long beat the cell phone rings
decidedly different than his past reactions to an incoming call paul seems hopelessly disinterested
the ring is maddening
he mindlessly presses the shortcut button resetting the ring to vibrate mode
he eventually picks up the phone but there is not anyone on the other end
its then that he sees that it was not a call that came in but instead was a picture message
pressing what appears to be the accept button the incoming picture begins to download
several seconds later the picture downloads and an image appears on the display of pauls cell phone
its of a woman bound and gagged a gun pressed against the side of her head
no no no
paul frantically dials the number to reach jabir
as soon as the phone connects paul begins his desperate plea
let her go
please dont hurt her
the woman is heard in the background of jabirs phone crying muffled words through her muzzled mouth
we shoot her if you no make video
no please no shoot
no shoot her
you get money
i will i promise
just dont shoot her
shes a mother shes got two kids
she has two kids
i have five
now only one
you make video
i give three seconds
i cant read the paper
i dont know what you want me to say
okay ill make the video
just please dont shoot
jabir does not fire his gun
paul attempts to catch his breath
i need to hang up to make the video
is that okay
you have three minute to send video
jabir hangs up ending the call
paul reaches for the balled up piece of paper that has the ransom script written on it
it takes some trouble for him to grab it but he is soon able to
placing the flashlight next to the paper paul is again reminded of the incoherent nature of the script
re the script fuck
he drops the paper to his side and opens the phone setting it to the video record function
he places the flashlight close to his face so as to make his image more visible on the small phone display screen
he presses the record button
speaking at the phone my name is paul conroy
im an american citizen from hastings michigan
im a civilian truck driver for crestin roland and thomas
ive been taken hostage somewhere in iraq
and i need one million dollars by nine oclock tonight baghdad time or else ill be left to die in this coffin im buried in
ive been told that if
the flashlight goes out
paul continues speaking in the darkness
after a few quick smacks the flashlight turns back on
the money is paid i will be let go
if its not i will die in here
these threats are real and will be followed through on
trying to think of more to say paul soon opts for not saying anything further
he saves the message and then sends it to jabir
we see that the screen displays an icon confirming the video has been sent
paul places the phone on his chest
still rubbing his temples his eyes begin to flutter a bit
he tries to control his breathing and remain calm
he opens the phone and displays the photo of the woman
he stares admiringly at her hoping dearly that she will not be harmed
the effects of the anxiety pills finally taking effect his eyes soon close and he drifts off to sleep
darkness once again
we hear the sound of paul slowly awaking followed the sight of zippo sparks
it doesnt catch
the second glow stick is snapped illuminating the coffin with a fluorescent green hue
paul starts to move but suddenly freezes
his eyes widen
his pupils dilate
something is clearly very wrong though we cannot see what
his eyes slowly shift downward as if watching something move down his body
beads of sweat form across his brow
his measured breaths are held for as long as they can be
moving excruciatingly slow paul lowers the glow stick toward what he is looking at
a shape moves across his stomach underneath his t shirt
pauls eyes are fixed on whatever it may be
he cautiously slowly moves the glow stick even closer
the shape disappears just as the light of the glow stick shines on whatever it may be
still paul does not dare make any sudden move
pauls pant leg moves slightly starting at the top slowly undulating toward his cuff
paul leans the glow stick in further
moving a millimeter at a time
he shifts the position of his head slightly charily to see next to his feet
he leans in even closer with the glow stick
but then his wary movement comes to immediate stop
its a snake
a two foot saw scaled viper
it has positioned itself in the corner of the coffin inches from pauls feet
his terror evident paul very slowly pulls his feet back toward his upper body away from the snake
the confined space offers little room for safety
the snake turns its muscled neck to face paul
their eyes meet for the first time
the snake hisses poised to strike at any moment
paul raises his foot
prepares to preempt the snake with a solid stomp
a more sensible plan soon prevails
after lowering his foot paul cautiously removes the flask from his pocket
slowly unscrews the top
splashes a small amount of alcohol on the floor close to the snake
the snake recoils slightly but then menacingly twists itself into a new posture ready to attack
paul lowers the zippo to the small puddle of alcohol
after a few sparks it lights
a flash fire
the snake flails and hisses wildly at the other side of a small fire wall
the flame soon goes out
paul moves fast
throws more alcohol this time some of it lands on the snake itself
he places the already lit zippo against the puddle of alcohol near the snake
another flash fire this time burning the snake
it hisses loudly
it swings back and forth challenging the small wall of fire
the fire soon extinguishes
the snake burrows into the hole from where it likely entered the coffin disappearing into it with haste
paul hurriedly stuffs the hole with his discarded button down shirt
he then pours a small amount of alcohol over the shirt and temporarily puts the flask on the ground but does not screw the cap on securely
he then wedges the lit zippo between a small space between two wooden planks
with the snake situation handled paul finally lets out a sigh of relief
rubs his eyes
tries to regain his faculties
looks over the list of phone numbers written above him
suddenly the cell phone vibrates
paul frenziedly searches for it but he cannot find it
he then notices it has fallen into the small hole near his feet out of his reach
he makes several attempts to grab the phone with his feet but he is unable to do so
it continues to ring
his next efforts involve repositioning himself in the coffin so that he completely turns to face the opposite end
struggling through each move paul painstakingly begins to turn himself
while turning however he inadvertently kicks the zippo from the side of the coffin landing it on the floor up against the glow stick and knocks over the flask
we see that the flame of the zippo slowly melts the plastic glow stick causing it to dim slightly
worst still and completely unbeknownst to paul a stream of alcohol slowly makes its way from the flask and toward the flame of the lighter threatening to set the coffin
inch by inch the flammable spirit gets closer
still in the midst of his repositioning paul looks back and sees the alcohol nearing the flame
in a panic he attempts to reach and grab the zippo
but he finds himself stuck in the middle of the coffin
he cant budge either way
no no no
desperately straining every muscle in his body he extends his arm backward toward the zippo hoping to move it away from the spilled alcohol
he still cant reach it yet he tries with all his might
the phone stops ringing
he has missed the call
he tries blowing at the flame but his head is too far away and his breath is not strong enough to do much more than cause it to flicker
with the alcohol now mere inches away from the flame paul reaches for his shoe
his odd positioning makes reaching his foot almost impossible
he struggles to undo the laces and remove it from his foot
with his face beet red from the force of his strain paul finally removes his shoe
the mere inch of leg room this creates allows him to slide his leg out from under him
the trail of alcohol is just about to come into contact with the flame but paul deftly maneuvers his body just in time to awkwardly kick the zippo out of
the way and close the lid
paul breaths an enormous sigh of relief as he sits in the dim light of the damaged glow stick
he notices another hole in the coffin
as a precaution he stuffs it with the cloth that had previously been used to gag him
just as he is about to grab the phone he hears what appears to be the faint sound of a muslim call to prayer being announced over the citywide pa
the sound barely makes its way through the hundreds of pounds of sand that envelop the coffin
a sign of hope as well as a point of reference for his location albeit a very vague one
he listens further as the call to prayer continues
the light of the glow stick dims further
paul then opens his phone
sees that he missed jabirs call
he starts to call jabir back but stops
he instead navigates through the various display menus
he soon reaches what appears to be the tools menu though its difficult to tell because everything is written in arabic
he becomes frustrated as he fails to find what he is looking for
on the verge of mental surrender he sees something that gives him pause
a smile crosses his face
re the phone screen there you are
we see on the display of the phone that paul has found a listing of languages
he scrolls past many francais detsche espanol stopping at english
presses the button instantly making all the text on the screen readable
he quickly navigates to the tools menu
locates the number of the cell phone he is using
he scribbles the number onto the top of the coffin
then a second pass making it bolder than the others
paul then dials his wifes cell phone
after only a few rings he is met by her voice mail
hi this is linda
please leave a message
thanks and have a great day
the beep sounds and paul frantically proceeds right into his message
linda heres the number for the phone
i just found it out
you have to use the international calling code first
please call me as soon as you get this
i love you
i love you
call me right away
paul hangs up
he looks at the battery life left on the phone
he then checks his watch
both are not good signs and he knows it
he begins to panic
grabbing the pocket knife that was left inside the metal box he slides the blade in the space between the sides of the coffin and the top
paul grabs the glow stick
but because it was partially melted to the floor the stick snaps in two
liquid oozes out of the small portion of the stick that remains stuck the floor
son of a
paul grabs the flashlight
turns it on
it works for a second but then goes out
shaking it only produces intermittent beams of light
he turns the top switching to the red bulb
the coffin fills with a reddish hue but then it too goes out
growing incensed paul switches back to the white bulb
he returns his attention to the coffin
his efforts to use the knife as a fulcrum are futile
still he tries
bending the blade well past its design it nearly breaks off its handle
the flashlight turns off
after a good shaking it turns back on emitting white light
with oxygen levels extremely diminished efforts of this kind are all too much for paul to take
he has to stop and try to catch his breath
as he endeavors to get his wind back the cell phone rings
not a call this time but instead a video message
it has been sent by jabir
pauls trepidation is evident
he fears what the incoming video may show
after a beat he presses the accept button and the video downloads
within seconds the video plays on his phone display screen
we see in the video the american woman that previously appeared in a picture message that was sent to paul
she is still bound at her wrists but her gag has been lowered
she sits on her knees
standing behind her are three men all with their faces shielded by arab headdresses
they each hold ak assault weapons
paul watches in horror as the terrified woman speaks through her tears into the camera
my name is pamela gorham
im a food service worker at f
anaconda employed by crestin roland and thomas
my captors requests for ransom have gone unanswered and the woman pamela looks off screen to her right
someone is fast approaching her
she cowers protectively holding her bound hands in front of her face as she screams
to the person no
another iraqi man steps into the cameras line of site a handgun already brandished
without as much as a moments hesitation he fires two rounds directly into pamelas head killing her
the video message ends immediately thereafter
paul is in complete shock
he screams aloud slamming his closed fist against the bottom of the coffin
no no no
still in the throes of emotional torment paul vomits on himself
he doubles over only to vomit once again
his body taxed almost to the point of complete physical breakdown gradually slows and levels itself
with his vomit smeared face pressed cheek down onto the bottom of the coffin paul stares into nothingness
after a beat his eye catches a glimmer of light the blade of the knife reflecting off the beam of the flashlight
paul reaches for the knife
lying on his back still suffering enormous mental strain he places the cutting edge of the blade against his neck
his jugular vein
his hand shakes his lips tremble
the hand that holds the blade tightens its grip on the handle
it too shakes
paul closes his eyes
a small amount of blood begins to drip from the side of his neck where the blade of the knife rests ready to open his vein
after a great deal of consideration paul throws the knife to the foot of the coffin
he cant do it
the flashlight falls from pauls chest
it turns off upon landing on the floor of the coffin
paul sits in darkness
his breaths echo off the coffin walls
after a beat he turns on the flashlight
it turns off after less than two seconds
this time however he does not shake it nor does he hit it
a moment later we hear a click followed by the sight of a red light beam emitting from the flashlight
it holds steady
paul shines it onto the names and phone numbers written on the top of the coffin
he stops at mark white
after a beat he lowers the flashlight to his side
he picks up the phone and dials brenner
after one ring brenner answers
hes clearly not pleased
paul however is surprisingly calm
almost disturbingly so
why the hell did you make that video
its all a bunch of lies
what are you talking about
all of it
all of what
nobody gives a shit about any of us
were nothing to you people
were going to find you
by looking the other way
you cant start breaking on me now paul
you have to stay strong
you let her die
after a beat no i didnt
they shot her
and you didnt do anything
we didnt even know she had been taken hostage
she sent three videos
thats what they told her to say
i dont know
what do you know
that your ransom video already has hits on youtube
and all the major networks are playing it including al jazeera
so now your captors have no choice but to follow through
i found out the number to this phone
i found a way to change the display language
i figured that out and you didnt
because i didnt
just like you and every other person on this planet there are some things i know and some things i dont
then how are you ever going to find me
their signal was cloned like we figured
but were close
what about mine
were working on that too
im near a mosque
i could hear the call to prayer over the p
that means that were in the right area
i spoke with soldiers from the third id who were escorting your convoy
after a beat not all of them
both bradley tanks were hit with ieds
the rest got caught in small arms fire
what the hell happened out there paul
paul doesnt answer at first
after a beat we had just left anaconda everything seemed okay
we knew that a bunch of our cb radios had been stolen and that the iraqis were listening in so we made sure to switch from our usual channels
pam was riding with jeff breer the convoy commander
she wanted to ride with me like she usually did when she hitched a ride from base but it seemed safer for her to be with the c
as we headed down the road all these kids came running into the street
dozens of them
it almost seemed like they were expecting us except we got there faster than they thought we would
so they run on up in front of me and i slam on my brakes
the rest of the drivers were already further up ahead so they kept going
next thing i know one of the lead trucks got hit by an ied
i hear tommy wilkes on the radio saying sandmans hit sandmans hit
thats when the iraqis came out of their mud huts from the side of the road and started shooting everybody
i couldnt believe what was happening
it seemed like slow motion like i was watching it on tv
people my friends were getting killed and all i could do is watch
i didnt even notice that the kids were throwing bricks and rocks at me until one split my windshield
sort of snapped me out of my trance
but then i guess i got hit in the head with a rock cause i blacked out
do you happen to remem
the cell phone service begins to cut out
suddenly the coffin begins to vibrate slightly dropping sand granules through the crack and onto the wood bottom followed by the faint sound of an explosion
within seconds the explosions grow louder and more proximate
the vibration becomes so intense that it violently shakes paul around the coffin
the sound of jet plane engines are heard coming from above flying by as the massive explosions continue
sand seeps in through the crack between the top and sides of the coffin as it shakes
paul does his best to brace himself but the bombardment is far too powerful
a large crack forms in the wooden cover to the coffin spanning almost its entire length
sand immediately pours through the concave shaped crack seeping in onto paul like an hourglass
fearing that the top of the coffin may collapse under the immense pressure from the sand above paul positions himself underneath it and presses with all his might
he grunts and screams loudly using what little strength he has left to keep the top from caving
the shaking soon stops though the steady flow of sand continues
in efforts to prevent the sand from filling the coffin any faster paul removes the button down shirt from the hole and stuffs into the area where it enters with
the greatest volume
he removes the balled up cloth from the other hole and does the same with it
both offer very little help
the flashlight falls to the floor
the red light beam turns off
the sound of sand steadily pouring down
paul clicks the flashlight to a different setting
white light shines but then goes out
he shakes the flashlight and it stays on shining its normal white beam
he assesses his situation noticing that the coffin is already filled with a small layer of sand a situation that is only going to get worse with time
this cant be happening
we see that dan brenner is no longer on the phone and that the display menu shows an icon of a phone with a line through it no service available
once he feels it is secure enough paul slowly moves his body away from the crack
although slightly caved it does not show any more signs of possible collapse
sweat drenches his face
his eyes affixed in utter disbelief on the sand as it spills into the coffin filling in around him inch by inch
he grabs the cell phone only to see that he does not have a signal
he shakes the cell phone and moves it all around the coffin hoping that it may somehow help
his efforts are futile
the flashlight goes dead
he hits it shakes it
it turns back on
the brightness is diminished
still the sand continues to fall drowning him deeper and deeper in a pool of granules
then very surprisingly the cell phone rings
paul answers right away
alan davenport answers calmly from the other end
is this paul conroy
yes this is paul
who are you
paul my names alan davenport im the personnel director here at crestin roland and thomas
i left you a message
i also heard from rebecca browning over at the state department
are you able to speak on the status of your situation
there was an explosion or something
the coffins breaking theres sand pouring in from everywhere
i only have a half an hour before okay okay
you should try to stay calm
tell me something paul who have you spoken to
the hostage takers dan brenner from the hostage working group okay paul
im with you
how about the media
i know your ransom video leaked but have you spoken directly to anyone about whats going on
the flashlight goes out
paul hits it a few times and it turns back on
it needs to stay that way
its important that we keep this situation as contained as possible
paul finds alans obvious concern with doing damage control to be infuriating
about three inches to my right theres a wall
three inches to my left theres another wall
and about four inches above my head theres a roof thats about to collapse and drown me in sand
i think this situation is pretty contained
i know youre upset help me
what are you going to do to help me
i know youre upset
and from what ive been told steps are being taken to get you out of there
so hopefully it wont be much longer
yes thank god
im going to switch on a recorder right now
just a second
pauls visage expresses his confusion
a click is heard in the b
of alans phone followed by a low steady hum
alans speech becomes very laconic
his questions are clearly being read from a human resources handbook of some kind
this is alan davenport personnel director for crestin roland and thomas incorporated
the date is october
i am speaking with paul conroy
mister conroy are you aware that im recording this conversation
please answer the question
the flashlight goes out again
paul hits it but it does not catch
he sits in darkness
and do i have your permission to do so
why do you need my permission
what is all this
i need you to answer yes or no please
paul hits the flashlight
it turns back on
now mister conroy when were you hired by crt
about nine months ago
around january of
why are you wasting time with this
i have your official date of hire as january th
is that correct
this is fucking crazy january th
is that correct
and during your initial training before being sent to iraq were you made aware of the dangers inherent to the position for which you were hired
you mean when i came down there to dallas and you guys said that all of the trucks would be armored and have bulletproof glass
the flashlight dims
paul angrily shakes it returning it to full strength
you mean when you told us that things were safer than ever over here
is that when i was made aware
i need you to answer yes or no please
the flashlight begins to slowly dim
during that time did you also receive and sign an employment contract with crt which thoroughly explained company policy as it pertained to your specific terms of employment
yeah i signed a bunch of things
yes or no
i signed the contract
its our understanding that you were taken hostage in iraq two hours ago is that also correct
thats completely correct
what is the point of all this
alan breaks from the h
handbook script though his tone remains just as matter of fact
the flashlight continues its steady slow dim
our legal department requires that we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees confirming that they understand the reasons for their forced separation from the company
as of this morning your employment with crt was officially terminated
wait wait wait the flashlight dims even more
it was brought to our attention that you were engaging in relations with a fellow crt employee pamela gorham
wait stipulated in your contract was a fraternization clause in which it was stated quite clearly that any relationship be it romantic or sexual in nature deemed inappropriate by crt
senior officials is grounds for immediate termination
we were just friends
our records indicate differently
this is bullshit
were also legally required to inform you that because you were technically no longer under the employ of crt at the time of your abduction we cannot be held accountable
for any injury that may befall upon you after your official date and time of termination
therefore in your case that includes this incident or any consequences that may result from it
paul sees where alan is going with this
what about my insurance money
my family will need that money
given that you were alive up until the time of your termination you son of a bitch
you cant do this
do you understand everything you cant do this
alan takes a second before trying again
do you understand everything youve been told mister conroy
paul does not answer
after a long beat go to hell
that concludes our interview with paul conroy
i am now turning off the recorder
a click is heard
the humming ceases
you people cant just wash your hands of this
you bastards put me here
alan ends the call
paul looks at the phone it is still holding a steady signal
battery life however is running quite low
all that remains is one blinking bar indicating that paul has very little battery life left
he shakes his hand free of the pile of sand that now covers it and looks at his watch
the flashlight bulb dims until it goes out completely
only the light of the cell phone display lights the coffin
wasting little time paul dials jabir
the phone rings and rings but jabir does not answer
checking to make sure the he dialed the correct number paul matches it against the phone number he wrote onto the wall of the coffin
seeing that he did in fact dial correctly paul again tries to call jabir
while he waits through the many rings he tries relighting the zippo
no one answers
pauls disquietude is evident in his increasingly erratic behavior
answer the phone
paul tries jabir once again but still he does not answer the phone
desperate exhausted why wont you answer
its then that something occurs to paul
he stares at the crack in the top of the coffin and the sand that pours in at an alarmingly fast rate
the crack has split jabirs written phone number in half
the aerial bombing
he wonders how it may have affected jabir and consequently his own chances of survival
he places his hand under the point from where the sand pours in most allowing it to collect on his palm and slip through his fingers
the flickering zippo flame tells of the diminished amount of oxygen
paul attempts to control his breathing realizing full well that there are not many more breaths he will be able to take
he then calls dan brenner
after a few rings brenner answers
paul is surprisingly serene
paul is that you
how do you know that
i just do
three f s levelled parts of the city a few minutes ago
i felt it
did they know i was here
the zippo flame flutters
after a beat yeah
did they care
dan does not answer
these people that took me if theyre dead they cant tell you where i am
we can still try to track down your signal
you tried that already
we can try again
paul appreciates dans effort but he knows there is little hope left for him
its over isnt it
after a long beat no
paul doesnt say a word
he knows that dan is lying
after a beat dan comes clean
the flame of the zippo becomes smaller
it clearly has little life left
what should i do
i dont know
thats right just like everyone else on the planet there are some things you know and some things you dont
i wish this could have gone differently
after a long beat paul ends the call
he forces a smile to his lachrymose face
utterly hopeless he opens the phone and turns on the video feature
he turns the phone to face himself projecting his image on the display
he presses record
this is paul steven conroy
social security number date of birth
this video will serve as my last will and testament
to my wife linda conroy i leave the seven hundred dollars in my personal savings and whatever i have left in my annuity
to my son shane conroy i
i dont know
i dont have anything else
my stuff like my clothes
i wish i had more
i wish i had done more
your dad wasnt really much of anything shane im sorry
maybe if i was a famous baseball player or a guy who wore a suit to work i would have more to leave you
but you can be one of those people if you want
you can be whatever you want
just promise me that when you get older youll take good care of your mom
and promise me that youll always try to do the right thing no matter what
i love you very much shane
maybe i never said that enough
maybe i did i dont even know
that probably means i didnt
im sorry linda
i should have listened to you
paul ends the video and closes the phone
he carefully places the phone into his pocket where it may hopefully be found if he ever is
he lays back staring at the almost completely extinguished zippo flame as the sand continues to rain on him
down and down it pours the sands of time passing might and main through the cracks
the zippo flame goes out
paul sits in the darkness resigned to what apparently will be his fate
hold on black for several seconds
until suddenly from inside pauls pocket he hears a faint vibration
its the cell phone
he looks at the number of who is calling him
shines the light of the cell phone on the list of numbers written on the top of the coffin
he cant believe what hes seeing
paul answers immediately
youre not dead
jabir is heard speaking frantically in arabic to the several other people in the room with him
jabir turns his attention to paul
where is money
i dont know
what dont know
i dont know where the money is
im not lying
im telling the truth
sounding panicked jabir again speaks in arabic to the other people in the room with him
they respond accordingly
paul tries to turn on the flashlight
it doesnt work
jabir returns his scornful attention to paul
from embassy you get money now
i need more time
paul shakes and hits the flashlight
it still does not work
no more time
theres sand pouring in here
please let me out of here and i will get you the money
jabir utters something in arabic to someone standing next to him seemingly asking a question and getting an answer from the same individual
paul unscrews the top of the flashlight
switches the positioning of the batteries
screws the cap back on
hits the switch
jabir returns to the phone
you show blood
paul unscrews the top of the flashlight again
removes the batteries
bites down on them a few times
blows hard inside the flashlight tube
you show blood they give money
you cut off thumb finger send video
im not doing that
paul puts the batteries back inside the flashlight
begins screwing on the cap
thats right no
you let me out of here and ill cut off my whole god damn hand if you want
jabir again says something to someone in the room with him returning to paul after a brief moment
paul finishes closing the top of the flashlight
you have wife
the flashlight turns on
paul considers jabirs question to be a potential sign of compassion
yes i do
and a son
a young son
i want to go home
to see them
i say that out of respect
east walnut street
why did you say that
you show blood
or they show blood
all of you
you cant get to them
youre peasants criminals thats all
you dont even know where michigan is
even this basic knowledge is enough to make jabirs threats that much more real
you looked at a map
thats all you did
you show blood or they show blood
send video by five minutes
jabir ends the call
realizing that jabir is gone paul quickly dials his wifes cell phone
after several rings her voice mail picks up
hi this is linda
please leave a message
thanks and have a great day
linda listen to me you and shane have to go somewhere
dont stay at the house whatever you do do not stay at the house
the kidnapper he knows our address
he stole my license and now he knows where we live
go to the sheriffs station if you have to just dont go home
paul hangs up
he takes a moment to look around noticing that the coffin is almost halfway filled with sand
re the sand holy god
paul then dials dan brenner
after only one ring the call goes directly to voice mail
the flashlight starts to dim
paul shakes it causing it to regain its strength
this is daniel brenner
please leave a message at the tone
the beep sounds
paul delivers a frenzied message
brenner where are you
he just called me
call me right away
the fucking guy is still alive
paul hangs up the phone
unsure what to do next pauls heartbeat races
he fidgets nervously shaking and tapping his thumb against the phone
he questions the validity of jabirs threats toward his family
they cant find them
theres no way
paul opens the phone and brings up the photo of pamela bound and gagged
the image causes paul to second guess himself
the flashlight goes out
the cell phones display illuminates pauls face
he then replays the video in which pamela is seen being shot
reliving the experience is extremely painful though his concern is more on his own family at this point
however the video is enough to convince paul of jabir and his cohorts convictions
paul tries the zippo
he tosses it aside
his breathing grows erratic and labored
his eyes dart from side to side his throat groans involuntary noises of fear
paul then looks at the knife and then at his watch
he has less than two minutes to send the video to jabir
fearing for the safety of his family he must meet jabirs demands
he hits the flashlight a few times
it turns on
paul opens the phone and sets it to take video
he places it flat onto the surface of the sand which by this point is already filling the coffin halfway
he then reaches for the knife
oh my god
oh my god
he places his hands against the side of the coffin spreading his fingers
he stares intently at his thumb
with the extremely sharp knife in hand paul slowly lowers it just above his thumb
he inhales and exhales deep breaths almost hyperventilating
paul then reaches into the sand and finds one of the expired glow sticks
he shakes the sand off of it and places it across his mouth biting into it hard
his heart races his breaths are the deepest hes ever taken
after placing the flashlight on the ground to ensure that the camera picks up the image he presses the record button on the cell phone
grinding his teeth into the glow stick and letting out a primordial scream paul closes his eyes and chops down with the knife
we see through the display screen of the phone paul sever his thumb with a swift chop of the blade
a small spray of blood spatters onto his face as he screams out in unfathomable pain
he falls to his side still screaming and writhing
he reaches for his discarded outer shirt which is still stuffed in the crack to help slow the influx of sand
removing the shirt from the crack instantly causes the sand to fall into the coffin more rapidly
paul wraps the shirt around his hand
the blood quickly soaks right through it
he is fading fast
his blood loss is great
shock sets in
he musters up the strength to send the video to jabir
to secure his shirt over the wound paul removes his belt from his waist and pulls it tight over his wrap
growing increasingly more pale paul teeters on the verge of consciousness
everything becomes blurry to him
the phone falls from his hand
his lips turn a light shade of purple and his face ash white
everything becomes more and more blurry
he fights with every last ounce of strength to remain conscious
while laying against the side of the coffin the phone vibrates once again
to paul the vibration against the wood seems so distant so foreign
the vibration grows louder and louder in his mind sounding more and more like the sound of rotating helicopter blades
he then hears what sounds like voices yelling from on top of the coffin
hes down here
get him out
paul were here
the cacophony of voices form a mosaic of sound in pauls head each overlapping the other in distant echoes
shovels digging deep into the ground are heard banging against the top of the coffin
the top of the coffin is torn open sending a brilliant ray of white light onto paul
he stares into the light crying eking out a tortured smile
suddenly paul is back in the same predicament
the voices the shovels the light it was all a hallucination brought upon by his loss of blood
hes still alone
hes still in the coffin which continues to fill up with sand
he is too exhausted to display his disappointment
the phone continues to vibrate
it soon stops
paul is in too poor condition to show any concern
after a beat the phone begins vibrating once again
after several rings paul languidly picks it up
he barely recognizes the number through his extremely blurred vision
hes so weak hes barely able to formulate words
he spits out stray particles of sand from his mouth
paul its brenner
paul doesnt have the strength to answer
are you there
were coming for you now
you hear me
we know where you are
this news serves as somewhat of an adrenaline rush for paul who musters up even the modicum of strength he seemingly did not have left in him
we are paul
were almost there now
how do you know
coalition forces picked up a shiite insurgent just outside of baghdad
said he knew where an american was buried alive
he agreed to show us where if we let him go
youre coming for me
were practically there already
an impossible smile fights its way to pauls lips
his momentary joy is just that however for the sand has almost completely filled the coffin by this point
you have to hurry
you have to hurry
its filling up fast
just hang in there for three more minutes
this will all be over soon i promise
paul is very hopeful that dan is correct in his assumption
i believe you
a beep is heard
paul has another call coming in
hes visibly elated upon seeing who it is
try to i have to go
paul no call me right back
call me right back
paul switches to the other call despite the fact that he has a mere eight inches left before the entire coffin is filled with sand from top to bottom
he holds the flashlight just above the top of the sand pile allowing it to illuminate what little unoccupied area remains
linda is in hysterics which is evident in her speech
paul is that you
tell me its you
its me sweetie
oh my god paul
what are they doing to you
please tell me youre okay
i just saw the news
oh my god baby
the flashlight dims
paul shakes it regaining a bit of its strength
its going to be okay now
i missed all your calls
i left my cell phone at home
i just found out what was going on
its all okay
theyre getting me out
they found out where i am and theyre on their way to get me
oh thank god
oh dear god thank you
the flashlight flickers
paul hits it
it flickers some more
its all going to be okay
how do you know for sure
oh god please tell me youre okay
the flashlight continues to flicker almost like a stroboscopic light from this point forward
i was so afraid i was going to lose you
linda breaks down in joyous tears
i love you so much
i love you so so much
i love you too
i should have listened to you
it doesnt matter
i should have never come here
you were right
sweetie i dont care
i just want you home
please come home to me
i swear i will
paul then receives a call on the other line
he checks to see whos calling
its dan brenner
theyre calling me right now
i have to go
call me right away
i love you
i love you
swear it again
i have to go
paul clicks over to the other line where dan brenner waits to speak with him
we hear dan yelling to people who are with him
a great deal of commotion and action is heard through the phone
dan yells to one of the soldiers who are with him
corporal get your men over here
dan gets back on the phone with paul he brought us right to you
to the soldiers start digging
lets go lets go
the flashlight fades
paul hits it momentarily returning it to full strength
meanwhile the sand inside the coffin has almost reached the very top
it continues to pour in from the crack seemingly faster than ever
paul struggles to keep his head above the sand giving him only a few inches between his face and the top of the coffin
you have to hurry
its almost full
just hang in there
to the soldiers dig
paul fights to keep his head above the sand
the flashlight dims
are you close
were almost there paul
were almost there
to the soldiers
were almost there
were right above you
the level of sand grows even higher
paul spits away falling sand that threatens to suffocate him
i cant hear you
where are you
were almost there
a soldier is heard off screen in the b
of dans phone
there it is
to the soldiers keep digging
we see the coffin
just hang in there
paul coughs out sand
he has a mere inch left above his head
where are you
i dont hear you
the soldier is again heard off screen in the b
of dans phone
to the soldier open it
nondescript noise is heard through the phone until it comes to an abrupt stop
oh my god
what is it
im so sorry paul
its mark white
he brought us to mark white
im we see the circled name of mark white written in capital letters on the top of the coffin
im so sorry
the battery life on pauls phone runs out causing it to power down
the filament of the flashlight bulb burns out
as it does the sand finally consumes the coffin filling it completely
we hear pauls muffled screams emanate through the sand until we no longer hear them at all
im sorry paul
im so sorry
