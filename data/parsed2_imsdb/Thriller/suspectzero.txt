suspect zero written by zak penn revisions billy ray directors shooting script november on a black wave vast oceanic and coming right at us
the wave is relentless huge menacing
we cant tell if this is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything noisily
it sucks it yawns it roars
then we realize
this massive wave of darkness is actually just a run off of dirty black water alongside the edge of an interstate
we pull out of it now
to find concrete and garbage and weeds
amongst the refuse is a discarded milk carton resting on its back
the carton asks have you seen me
above a photographed face thats been obscured by grime
yellowing newspaper old coke cans twinkie wrappers
in that bed of untended weeds
a hollow texas wind blows through it all
we stay with the carton
then that hollow wind gains speed
and a deep rumble grows in the distance becoming a roar
the yellowed newspaper lifts off and whips past us
as an wheel mack truck blows by just a blur in the corner of our frame doing in the pre dawn darkness
then the truck is gone and the rush of air dissipates
the milk carton the coke cans
they lie undisturbed
a light rain begins to fall
and some of the grime washes away from that milk carton revealing a face
have you seen me
to take in the vast flatness of texas i concrete forever
in the distance gray highway yields to black stormclouds gathering silently over endless prairie
a vertical vein of lightning streaks through one of them
a spoon stirring a cup of coffee
harold speck sits mid s pleasant face
a family man
reads rod and reel magazine
has a salesmans case by his side
around him is a truck stop in twilight truckers at the counter elvis on the wall a drink bud
the world series can be heard on a radio
top that off for ya hon
thats dolly a waitress been here too long
speck looks up smiles thinly no
dolly heads off
speck returns to his article underlining a particular passage
until a man seats himself suddenly in the seat opposite specks
speck reacts startled
the mans name is oryan
we only see pieces of him his eyes his hands a stain on his parka
whats in the case
youre always lugging that case around
speck looks around there are plenty of empty tables in here
so why is this guy bothering me
what do you sell
in restaurant supplies
i didnt get your name
must travel a lot huh
speck is looking for dolly a manager anyone
whole country or just hereabouts
i dont mean to be rude but hows your wife feel about it
that spun things a bit
she must get lonely with you gone all the time
do you get lonely
specks so thrown now he cant answer
ya miss fucking her harold
listen i dont know who you are but you cant oryan silences him
by holding up a piece of paper
on it is a drawing
the image faces away from us
but speck can see it in rich detail
and his eyes go wide
we catch glimpses the color of flesh
a body part
looks like a rendering of a young naked woman
and just like that speck finds himself staring
did it myself
its sort of a hobby
no reply ive got more
would you like to see them
oryan lowers it and slides a second drawing over
speck is speechless transfixed
cant look away
tell me those jokes about the traveling salesman and the farmers daughter are they true
speck remains silent here
this ones my favorite
oryan slides over drawing
again we dont get to see it
and we still havent seen all of oryans face
but we can see speck and his reaction
in fact he recoils so violently that his coffee spills
really says it all wouldnt you agree
thats a matter of opinion
he rises leaving the drawings behind
we stay with him as he crosses the diner deeply unsettled
he reaches the manager mel balding in no mood at the register
im having a problem with another customer
id like you to ask him to leave please
what kind of problem
hes he turns to point out oryan
but the booth suddenly is empty
the guy has simply disappeared taking those drawings with him
mel eyes him annoyed
speck hurries out to his buick checking over his shoulder repeatedly
gets to the car fumbles with his keys
they fall to the asphalt
he grabs them opens the door
speck guns the buick
interstate flies by
the farther he gets away from that diner the happier hell be
until a strange sound gets his attention its wind as if whistling through a ghost town
hollow varied building then falling off again
trouble is the windows in this buick are up
yet there it is again a thin hollow ghost town wind whistling over his shoulder
hes heard it before in every western he ever watched as a kid
but this wind is coming from his back seat
the blood drains right out of specks face
doesnt know if he should jam on the brakes or drive faster
he looks in his rear view catches a glimpse of a latex glove snapping onto a hand
dear god oryan is back there making that odd ghost town wind sound
sheer terror what do you want
what do you want with me
instead another gift appears from the back a fourth drawing tossed from the darkness into specks lap
he looks down registers the image
theres a rest stop next off ramp
pull into it
i have some money
its not a lot but nobody wants your money harold
just pull in
oryan rises into frame now like nosferatu
because i dont wanna do this at miles an hour
it could be dangerous
speck finds the off ramp
his breaths are shallow now
please mister what do you want from me
oryans face a knowing grin fans across it
the face of virgil ray starkey on a bulletin board
were looking at the f
s ten most wanted list
starkey is on it
his crime are listed as rape murder kidnapping
thomas mackelway stares at starkeys image
at the eyes
mackelway is bred for success bred for stardom in fact a whiz at everything hes ever attempted
so what the hell is he doing in wichita falls texas
eight agents in cubicles with a ring of outer offices
quiet phones lousy take out options hardly a dream gig
got a spot set up for you tom
thats rick charlton late s thinning hair friendly
charlton heads around a corner
potters the nice girl you met at the desk
she puts a package together for all the new agents things to know about the area help with finding apartments and such
this ones yours charlton stops at a cubicle carpeted walls formica desk
a corner of dull hell
mackelway eyes it fighting dread
not so different from dallas is it
fuck yes no sir
an abandoned sports page tells us about that world series so we must be mid october
charlton heads out
mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk setting up his world a framed picture of himself and his brother ages and on a childhood camping trip
address book coffee warmer calendar a baseball covered with autographs
he opens up a drawer and casually tosses two bottles of bufferin into the back of it
but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles and throws them down his throat as ya like frito pies
bill grieves stands here holding a white grease stained paper bag
grieves is mackelways age not quite as ambitious
but solid decent
what are they
grieves pulls out a greasy concoction thats wrapped up like a semi burrito
tosses it to mackelway welcome to the minors
grieves passes by with a faint smile handing out lunch to a few other agents
mackelway eyes the still wrapped frito pie
god get me outta here
a brief montage mackelway in his cubicle watching as those other agents take calls strap on guns head out on assignment
men in motion
but mackelways land locked writing up an auto theft report
its drudgery but hes meticulous about it deleting the word beige and replacing it with tan
his head is throbbing not an unusual circumstance for him
but after lingering for a half second on that most wanted list again
its a wound
mackelway struggles with a coffee machine thats unfamiliar to him
filter water grounds etc
lemme do that
this is katie potter
shes friendly under challenged by her job
been here two years
in two seconds shes got the thing percolating
it takes some experience
he shrugs not feeling too smooth
youre mackelway right
fax came in for you
its the room next door
he rises heads for the fax room
a former closet converted into useful space
five fax machines sit on stands sharing a surge protector
one fax machine is printing
mackelway approaches it
six pieces of paper await him
the first is a top sheet written by hand attention agent thomas mackelway fbi resident agency wichita falls
no sender named
he looks beneath the top sheet at page one of the fax
a young boy stares back at him his face photostatically copied
across the top also handwritten have you seen me
at the bottom of the sheet typed we read jason corey age
eyes brn hair brn
last seen riverside ca
date of disappearance
mackelway eyes the face then the vitals
no idea why this was sent to him
then he looks at page two
a young woman stares back at him this time
another faxed photo
another have you seen me
scrawled across the top of it
and at the bottom of the sheet anna casitas age
eyes brn hair blk
last seen macon ga
date of disappearance
the other three faxes are more of the same pictures and vitals
have you seen me
he looks at the bottom of the transmissions finds the fax number of the sender
all he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line
he eyes the faxes again
its not alarming but its odd
then charlton emerges from his office shouting mackelway
you gonna sit on your ass all day or do you wanna do something
mackelways out of this room in an instant
your standard roadside rest stop a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldnt go near
those stormclouds we saw earlier are closer now
police cars and highway patrol motorcycles fill this site
charltons fbi sedan pulls up
he and mackelway get out
two men approach sheriff harry dylan and his deputy bud granger a gangly baby faced pup
charlton nods looks like a robbery homicide
bodys over that way
he gestures toward a ravine where a tow truck is currently lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle
it is harold specks buick nose down in the ravine teetering on a rock like the balanced scales of justice
ya run the plates
charlton eyes mackelway easy hot shot
mackelway nods reminding himself to remember his new rank
dylan hands a preliminary report to charlton
fellas name is harold speck
traveling salesman from abilene
charlton eyes the report then hands it to mackelway
the hierarchy is being made clear
mackelway turns this ravine runs right up against a sign that reads welcome to texas on one side and you are now leaving oklahoma on the other
a vehicle left right on the state line
then a noise that tow truck winch grinding badly
its just about to yank the buick out of this ditch
it blurts out hey
before charlton can react mackelway is running across this weed choked lot zeroing in on the tow truck driver
the driver jumbo is operating the winch from a hydraulic handle on the back of the truck
mackelway barrels in what the fuckre you doing
whats it look like bud
mackelway reaches past jumbo and hits the stop button himself
the winch shuts down
a handful of local cops stand atop this ravine watching
you guys ever heard of evidentiary procedure
no one replies
mackelway tightens expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds
there wasnt time
charlton eyes the car
did the right thing agent mackelway
lets have a look
charlton starts down the embankment
mackelway doesnt hanging back as he eyes the tracks this buick made before tumbling
something about them
he pulls a small camera from his pocket a minox
snaps off a few photos of the scene the buick the ravine those tracks some footprints alongside them
then he heads down the foot embankment
its an ugly sight
speck is inches from us but his head is facing in the other direction twisted unnaturally
mackelway kneels beside the open window pulls out some gloves puts them on
he will not lean on the car or even breathe on it his caution around evidence obvious
charlton is opposite him outside the passenger side window pointing at the drawing that oryan had tossed onto specks lap
it lies face down on the seat
but somethings been finger painted on the back of it a red circle with a slash through it
charlton begins to reach for it when to stop him sir
mackelway indicates gloves
charlton eyes him
its irritating being corrected by a guy you outrank especially when hes right
sort of a
stickler for procedure
i imagine you would be
that was a jab but we dont know it yet
charlton puts on his gloves
mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that minox looking over the rest of this car as aloud hey jumbo
toss me down a crowbar
grangers by the trunk
before mackelway can comment jumbo has tossed a crowbar down from the top of the embankment a ten pound hunk of iron flying right at us
as it clangs on the roof of the buick
you said toss it
mackelway shakes his head
granger grabs the crowbar
hes just about to open the trunk as hold it a second
mackelway crosses to the trunk and snaps off a few shots with the minox
something catches his eye along the line of the trunk
he kneels closer
an odd residue crusty and hard has formed a thin line on top of the paint in a single post
he takes out a vial and scrapes some of the residue into it
then he sniffs it
he looks to granger now you can open the trunk
re mackelway where the helld you find this guy
impressed well now
charlton shrugs so what the hells he doin here
that one is left unanswered
granger opens the trunk
mackelway and the others look inside
there they find restaurant supplies napkin dispensers salt shakers ketchup dispensers a short order wheel
and a fishing reel tackle box a kids bicycle helmet
mackelway eyes it all but his instincts tell him theres nothing significant here
so he returns to specks body
he leans in lifts specks head a few inches away from the steering wheel
which is when we learn that specks eyelids have been torn off
its gruesome but mackelway notes it calmly
charlton leans in gets a look
mackelway is expressionless
but something about these lidless eyes draws him closer
he leans in then bam
we are rocketed into a series of dark disjointed images seems like were standing in a field of tall wheat we cant say for sure
everythings wet wind whipped
a muzzle flash
someone just fired a gun
we slump hard to the ground
then we look up
mackelway stands over us his face wet with rain
then just as quickly those images vanish and we are we start on the eyes of oryan
cross dissolve to a pad of paper on a desk
scrawled on the pad is a wavy line
he holds the tip of that pen upon it for a few seconds as if expecting to get some kind of pulse from it
here come those images again wet wheat a muzzle flash mackelway
choppy disjointed dark
then they cease
and oryan begins to draw hurriedly
only half of his face is visible to us but we can tell that his concentration is total
his pen continues its furious work a spasm of activity as the sounds of that vision bleed in the gun shot the rain the wind
theyre all alive in oryans mind
and that drawing takes shape quickly the wheat field the gun mackelway
then the pen is set down
the drawing is complete
oryan eyes it calmly then checks his watch jotting down the exact time and date on to the drawing
then he slips it into a folder marked mackelway
picket fence a swing on the porch a lawn that needs mowing
a line of people file in each bringing food
and tissues to cry into
food on unmatching trays
specks wife jan and frayed sits in a chair immobile
friends and family mill about tending to her
two of them a year old boy and an year old girl sniff back tears as people offer condolences
but the focus here is jan her grief
she looks up
oryan crouches down to eye level one of fifty faces in here
jan half nods
just wanted to offer my condolences
takes her hand i didnt know him well but
i think harold was a much more complex man than people realized
jan is so raw that anything about speck touches her now
through tears he was wasnt he
im very sorry for your loss maam
she sniffs back a tear thanks him with a smile
oryan extends his hand to her
she takes it
he moves off
beside her is a framed portrait of speck
we blow past it and into the black crepe that is adorning the corner of the portraits frame and bam
were rocketed back into a set of odd images again this time everything before us is a blur of gray
we hear that wet wind
we hear our own heavy breathing as if we were running somewhere
a voice rising above the wind seems to be saying please
the sound echoes oddly as if bouncing off a satellite somewhere or a distance of time and space
then the sound and the soupy grayness vanish
this vision just ended
when we pop back out of it were tight on mackelway
mackelway sits behind the wheel of his chevy yukon parked between two big rigs in the lot of the all american diner
sky looks black tonight
and that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw
it was all his
he pulls four more bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket
slugs them down
this headache is a constant
then he gets out of the yukon
mackelway enters spots charlton at a booth sitting opposite a woman her back to us
the woman doesnt turn
i was bout to introduce you but i understand that wont be necessary
mackelway doesnt get it
until the woman turns
she is agent fran kulok
sharp pretty when she allows herself to be
but with a guard that never comes down
mackelway has some history with her so he tries not to react
it takes some effort
seems your former office has decided we might need some help on this one
so they sent out agent kulok
that was terse from both of them
charlton takes note
i guess were skipping the tearful reunion
have a seat tom
mackelway sits opposite fran
she folds her hands
hows things back at the ranch
movin right along
that mightve been a dig charlton cant tell
whadda we know
picked up a foot print in the back seat of specks car size and a half bigger than specks
just like that fran is piping up
wounds on specks throat indicate that he was strangled from behind
i think our guy waited for him in the backseat sprung this on him once the car was moving
she slides that fourth drawing to charlton giving us our first look at it
a steamer trunk lined with plastic
inside it are large ziploc bags
inside the bags are body parts
its realized so accurately that it looks more like a photograph
no wonder it horrified speck so deeply
charlton eyes it without reaction
lab picked up talcum traces on the edges of the paper consistent with powdered gloves
charlton nods so he gets the dropped in his lap it spooks him and the car winds up in the ravine
plausible enough until i dont think so no
i think it was pushed
how ya figure
the look of the tracks
foot prints near the embankment
without embellishing any further he slides over the photographs that he took this morning with the minox tire tracks foot prints
she eyes them
then she eyes mackelway
charlton notes the tension
so our guy likes to draw pictures of body parts and then spring em on people
whats that get us
theyre silent thats what i thought
there is plenty going unsaid here between mackelway and fran
charlton has no time for it
fore i forget
this came in for you he tosses a by envelope at mackelway who opens it
six sheets of paper slide out
first one we see is the top sheet of a fax same hand written inscription as the last one attention agent thomas mackelway fbi resident agency wichita falls
this is twice now
he knows what will be under this top sheet without even looking
but heres page one a photo of a middle aged african american woman
across the top of the photo in hand writing have you seen me
and typed on the bottom tanya green
eyes blk hair blk
last seen ames iowa
date of disappearance
the following four sheets bring four more faces men women young old
four more have you seen mes
but before he can think it through he hears its about time
that came from the night manager a humorless guy named les
hes looking at the front door through which dolly has just entered
pink cowboy boots tonight
dont start in on me les
i couldnt get the pickup started and harlan took the dodge
the manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the booth
dolly stops short taken aback
my one shot at winding up on cops and im in my weekday boots
dolly and mel sit opposite mackelway and fran
he was a quiet guy
liked to read fishing magazines
not much of a tipper
is that a lousy thing to say
mel rolls his eyes
what can you tell us about the other man
like i said i never really saw him
harold came up complainin about the guy but time i turned he was gone
at dolly at dolly could you de did you get a they each stop short waiting for the other to yield
finally mackelway nods go ahead
can you describe him maam
dolly pauses her face scrunching a bit
guy was in here better part of an hour
we had a real pleasant chat
but i cant remember a thing about him
for the life of me
couldnt even tell you what color his eyes were
she shrugs apologetically
happen to see what he was driving
that ones easy
its still in the lot
they perk up the bonneville out there with the awful paint job
she gestures to the lot where an old pontiac bonneville sits its paint stripped down to the primer
fran and mackelway eye it then one another
fran and mackelway emerge heading for the bonneville
we ought to work out some kind of protocol
looks pretty silly our talking over one another
ill handle them from now on
he doesnt argue
they come to a stop at that bonneville stripped down to its primer
time to work
two agents all instinct
we see them study things details their minds always churning
mackelway pulls out his minox snaps off a few more shots
then trunks ajar
sure enough the bonnevilles trunk is ajar
mackelway approaches cautiously
he doesnt have gloves on him so he uses his jacket pocket to protect against prints
he opens the trunk
first thing he sees is that symbol again a circle with a slash through it
staring right at him
but this time its been carved into somebodys back
so does fran
before them lies a body stripped to the waist a chunky middle aged man
things just got tougher
harold speck lies on a table
a bespectacled coroner examines him
victim barney fulcher lies on another his ample frame yet to be examined
the lights are out but that coroner wears a fluorescent halo with a microphone pinned to his gown
he speaks into it with a quiet monotone anatomical terms etc
mackelway and fran are here
mackelway is particularly focused on fulchers face
his eyelids we now see have also been torn off
no other signs of torture here
why take somebodys eyelids off
so they cant blink
she sighs aloud i know that already asshole
coroner keeps his head down speaking into that microphone
its a metaphor to make certain the victim sees
or to make certain that we see something
shes silent or maybe its just a fuck you
coroner continues his monotone narration
then crosses to the sink
that puts him out of earshot
to fran quietly im sorry about don
youre not wearing your ring anymore
that was an attempt at kindness
she knows that
still she eyes her left hand self consciously while mackelway loses himself in those lidless eyes of fulchers
then theres a knock at the glass window behind them
charlton stands on the other side of a glass window in a viewing room adjacent to this morgue
he presses a piece of paper up against the glass
on it in typed bold letters at the top we read matches one of one
below that we see that circle with the slash through it
this is a fax which charltons just received
he points further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at first until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street map
the ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission
those scrawled lines take us to the hope house in oklahoma city
at the bottom a scribbled name david dyson and a contact number
moving closer to the glass mackelway nods
he just got a break
a choir of first and second graders stands before a school assembly
the rest of boulder elementarys student body fills the seats in here along with faculty members
a framed picture of barney fulcher sits on a stand with candles around it a may zing grace how sweet the sound
in the back some of the townsfolk have gathered for this assembly touched
oryan stands among them
no expression on his face at all
a three story victorian residence in decay next door to a church soup kitchen in the middle of oklahoma citys skid row
the street is still
mackelway approaches this halfway house
a few lights shine within and the blue glow of a tv
upstairs can be heard the strident off key voice of somebody singing
the front door is open
through a screen door mackelway can see an old fashioned foyer
two sounds dominate the buzz from that tv and the strident singing which we realize is an a capela version of la vida loca audible through an open bedroom window
but no ones coming to answer the door and its wide open anyway
so mackelway enters
tv room is to his left
there a single year old drunk transient well call him piper sits watching behind the music on vh
piper doesnt look up or acknowledge mackelway at all
rather he increases the tv volume to drown out the singing upstairs which seems to be intentionally off key
torn couches stained carpet cracked window
posters and fliers on the walls
descending a creaking stairway is david dyson lean with a friendly smile
we are staring at a basement wall that has been covered floor to ceiling with identical renderings of that same symbol the circle with a slash through it
of them in bright red paint against pitch black enamel
only a machine could have achieved this kind of repetition
or a maniac
this basement is leaky drafty poorly lit
but its also quiet the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been muted by the basement door and the rain itself
benjamin spent hours down here
mackelway takes it all in every corner of this basement
he notes a row of standing gym lockers
re lockers did he have access to those
theyre staff only
would you mind opening them for me
dyson shrugs he thinks its a waste of time but hell do it
mackelway follows him across the dank room
he was here
seven years you said
off and on
its not uncommon for our guests to vanish for months at a time
dyson works a combination lock on the first locker
i ran the name through our database just to be sure
theres never been an agent benjamin oryan in the bureau
but as elaborate fantasies go it was one of my favorites
fondly and he always seemed so sincere about it
dyson half chuckles he always liked the guy
he throws open the locker
mackelway indicates the next locker
dyson works the combination
is that what you called him
its what he wished to be called
locker is opened also empty
only one locker left
re locker that ones mine
mackelway shrugs sorry it has to be opened
dyson sighs then works the combination
locker is opened
inside nothing incriminating a sweater some old junk two trophies
dyson eyes him see
dyson shuts the locker
mackelway looks to that wall copies of the circle with a slash through it
no idea what they signify
he painted one of the walls in his room too
can i see it
weve painted it over
still might be helpful
dyson heads for the stairs
theyre wooden slats with more basement junk stored below old sporting equipment an old vaccuum cleaner broken chairs rusted patio furniture
something just caught mackelways eye visible beneath these stairs a box with a bucket of paint sticking out of it
mackelway climbs under the stairs crouching down pushing aside all of the aforementioned junk
he grabs the box
sure enough that bucket once held red paint same color oryan used to cover that wall
theres also a bucket of black paint here
and some used brushes
mackelway brings the box into the meager light
we get a look inside it now
so does dyson
inside beneath the paint buckets we see a few tv guides a yo yo a football
then a book on tribal ritual and trance
mackelway grabs it eyes it
he flips through a few pages odd images a tribesman with eyes rolling back in his head strange rites etc
mackelway sets the book down
then amidst the other materials in this box he spots a large folded map
he grabs it begins to unfold it
we see that this maps been written on in pen
cities on it have been circled
but before we can get a good look at it mackelway spots something else at the bottom of this box a shocker a photograph of himself
it takes him a second to realize what hes looking at
but there it is a newspaper photo of agent thomas mackelway
it is part of a front page story dated july of this year concerning the trial and release
of virgil ray starkey
on the f
s most wanted list
dyson cant help but notice the picture of mackelway
suddenly we jump back in time nine months for a brief choppy flashback
were running dashing between two buildings of chipped adobe hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the thuds of our own heavy feet
this is matamoros mexico a shit hole of a border town
squalor and sin
we find a drunk mexican teen
he nods this is the place and sticks out his palm
mackelway stares at that newspaper starkey rapist murderer whose case was just thrown out of court a stunning failure for all involved
as we resume mackelways flashback matamoros again
bad lighting drunk patrons in a circle and a donkey show taking place on a bare stage
feels like weve stepped into some kind of evil carnival
among the crowd virgil starkey in an ugly drunken binge the only guy in here who isnt cheering or laughing
suddenly our gun is pointed right at his head
starkey freezes caught
some of the patrons around him find somewhere else to stand
but the show goes on
that article gives us more detail now the reason starkeys case was thrown out of court
it is this the f
agent on the case had made a mistake in evidentiary procedure
hence mackelways picture
on his face we go back to another memory six months ago
three months have passed since the arrest in matamoros
now mackelway sits in this courthouse anteroom adjacent to a courtroom
four sour prosecutors surround him
dyou understand how fucked we are
leaving a tissue sample in the care of a mexican lab
are you fucking kidding me
they assured me that they understood protocol
well guess what
and this pricks gonna walk ten murders or not
beneath this newspaper article are other articles all concerning starkey his crimes his capture all of it
mackelways memory just got stoked again mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom whipped
the halls busy with media and other traffic
first face he sees is fran who sits on a bench wedding ring on
her eyes say how lousy she feels for him
it almost helps
the door bursts open and mackelway storms in
no need to look composed now hes alone in here
he crosses to a paper towel dispenser slugs it
stares in the mirror
hes livid embarrassed frustrated can barely look at his own reflection
then he hears laughter behind him
out of the darkness of a badly lit stall virgil starkey emerges coming into view under a single light
beside him is a grim cop his chaperone
starkey passes by mackelway almost snickering
then hes gone
mackelway shuts his eyes tight
his head is pounding
at a record of his deepest wound
but what the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient
mackelway leans in looking around
a small end table
a window without bars
from down the hall we hear the sound of a phone ringing then a fax transmission
an old fax machine begins to whine noisily creaking
its a distraction
but mackelways focus is in this room
the walls have been newly painted
but theres a hint of barely perceptible color beneath one of them
rain from a leaky roof is causing some of the new paint to peel a bit
a bucket collects drops in the center of the room
the feeling in here is damp mildewy creepy
mackelway remains in the doorway
then backs out
i guess you fellasre never unaccounted for huh
mackelway turns a bit startled
dyson is approaching fax in hand
dyson extends six pages
on the top sheet written by hand are the words agent thomas mackelway c o mr
david dyson hope house with a street address
and under that top sheet
five more pages
mackelway sighs takes them from dyson
sure enough hes staring at five more faces five more fact sheets
five more have you seen mes
but how would anyone know to send them here
doesnt look up no
dyson is glad to hear it
mackelway descends having had quite enough of this place
piper is where we left him watching vh in the tv room
mackelway passes eyeing those newly faxed pages five more have you seen mes
he reaches the door
ever seen a fifty foot shark
mackelway stops turns
fifty foot shark
ever seen one
doesnt mean there arent any
mackelway reaches for the front door again
then he halts
maybe this guy can be helpful
mackelway turns did you know him
pipers silent the guy who used to stay upstairs
did you know him
is he dead
you said did
is he dead
i mis spoke
no hes not dead
a beat you know him
mackelway eyes him then approaches holding up a copy of that image the circle with slash through it
he ever talk about this
a circle with a slash through it
piper rises crosses to us
leaning in unnecessarily close
thats not a circle
its a zero
how do you know
piper doesnt answer
instead he simply starts whistling
but its not a tune coming out of his mouth
its that same sound that oryan made a whistling wind blowing through a ghost town
building then falling again
piper smiles backing away enjoying the theatricality of it stifling a giggle
then suddenly everything turns grainy choppy
weve jumped into a distorted remote pov of this same scene as if watching it through a crystal ball or a broken lens or a distance of time and space
we see images fragments piper the tv the sofa mackelways face
then all sound breaks up and we are
start on oryans eyes
then a pad of paper
the spasm of a pen scrawling a list on to it piper
were in another non descript motel room
he holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that list of words keeping it there for a few seconds as if expecting to receive some
kind of pulse from it
no more pulse
he has lost the connection that had somehow transported him
he notes his watch
jots down the exact time
slips the pad into that folder mackelway
then he starts to draw a hurried but accurate sketch of mackelway and piper just as they stood during that conversation
the geography is fairly accurate
oryan continues to draw
we crane out of this motel room to find on the street below a typical honky tonk in a town called sleeper missouri
just across the street from oryans cheap motel
low lights dust on the floor
loretta is a pretty year old who stands at the jukebox weighing her choices
shes got a thick curtain of hair which she wrangles with a chip clip
its a habit
she chooses a country rock tune then heads for the bar walking to the beat
its fun being and beautiful
the bartenders a stocky guy with a broad smile
re song hows that
little cute for my taste but i can stand three minutes of it
ill have a seven and seven please
seven and seven
got some i
she half laughs as if she hasnt been carded in a decade and throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other re fastening that chip clip
its her best move
its in the car
no ones asked me for it for a couple years now
if ya hurry youll still catch the end of the song
she eyes him are you really carding me
he smiles nothing personal sugar
so she heads for the door
on her way she passes a booth
in it we find a familiar face virgil ray starkey
he remains still as if he hadnt noticed her
but behind his eyes something primal just took place
he rises heads for the door
loretta walks to her vw bug
starkey exits the bar
she doesnt notice
we tilt up the lights are off in oryans motel room
it all happens pretty fast that chip clip hits the ground beside the open vw door
a battered pick up speeds away kicking up gravel
lorettas eyes wide with terror and dread
were off road
missouris woods can be seen through the windshield
and starkey is staring at us
pawing at us
starkeys hand shoots out banging lorettas head against the window hard
that makes things start to swim
starkey tears at her clothes lowers himself on to her
we carry the sound of it into this is where you go when youve just moved to wichita falls and moneys tight spotty shag carpet chipped formica kitchen table scuffed
and one sleepless agent having one lousy night
mackelway sits on the edge of his bed almost able to hear lorettas helpless cries
some nights are like this
his head is pounding again
down go four more bufferin
above him covering the bedroom mirror is the map he took from that hope house basement
oryans map unfolded
its huge feet wide feet tall obscuring the mirror
as we glimpsed while still in that basement this map his been written on in pen
oryans notations cover it over a thusand cities on it have been circled by hand in red
each of those circled cities has a date written beside it also in red etc
mackelway studies it his face working
another of those whimpers from loretta seems to hang suspended
mackelway shakes it off certain that hes imagining it
he wont sleep a wink tonight
we leave him returning to the attack continues its terror unimaginable
starkeys too powerful to fight off
we stay on her face dazed her mind simply checking out
until a look of cognizance comes over her brought on by a shadow that just passed by
then the window behind starkey simply explodes
glass flies everywhere and two arms reach into the pick up
they grab starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick up his back sliced open by shards
she cant resist coming to the window where she sees starkey lies face up
standing over him looming large as a grizzly
a long hunting knife extends from his hand
but his tone to our great surprise is conversational hey listen im sorta new in town
ya know where i can find a good donkey show
starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac huh
in america animals have rights
pointedly dont they virgil
how the fuck should i know
oryan half smiles then kicks starkey right in the head
lorettas eyes go wide
another kick follows to the ribs
then one to the groin
at loretta turn around
he said that without looking at her
but he can tell that she hasnt moved too frightened
so he eyes her
again turn around
she turns away lying face down on the seat covering her head
no idea what kind of terror is to come next
we stay with her
able only to hear what follows the sound is animal awful like a pig being gutted a horrible squeal covering the grunts coming from oryan
in goes the knife again prompting another agonized cry from starkey
lorettas crying too from fear shock
she keeps her face buried shutting her eyes tight
the sounds of savagery fill the night
then one last gasp from starkey
followed by an awful silence
and the assault is over
lorettas too afraid to look up certain that the maniac with the knife will be coming after her next
but then she hears footsteps trailing away
so she rises peeking over the edge of the window
we stay on her face as she sees whats become of her attacker
her horrified scream fills the woods
mackelway stares out the window seems like he just heard that scream
of course thatd be impossible
he looks to that map
his phone rings
he eyes it unsurprised
law enforcement vehicles surround the site
cops grieves coroners guys taking pictures
loretta is sitting on the back of an ambulance being tended to
a composite artist sits beside her trying
i dont think the eyes are right
no they were
i dont really know
composite artist keeps trying but his attempt doesnt look anything like the face of oryan
charlton meanwhile stands over the body mind racing
a missouri highway patrol car pulls up
mackelway steps out of it
we follow him as he takes in the scene
a flashbulb illuminates starkeys chest is got a zero with a slash through it
but mackelway hasnt seen the guys face yet
charlton turns we got an i
mackelway waits might wanna find yourself a fender
youre gonna need to sit down
mackelways still waiting its virgil ray starkey
we stay on him for a moment as it registers
the man he caught and then lost has killed again
struggling for composure starkey did this
starkeys the one on the ground
mackelway pauses thinks he mustve heard wrong
but he turns toward the face as another flashbulb illuminates it searing the image into the darkness
his eyelids ripped away
mackelway stares stunned
cant fucking believe it
breathless my god
its like looking at a ghost a spectre thats been haunting him dead now
mackelway pulls out his minox starts photographing moving in on those lidless eyes
gonna make a wallet size of that one
give him a break grieves
mackelway doesnt comment
just keeps snapping shots
the number of have you seen mes has now grown quite a bit
pages sit stacked on mackelways desk
he grabs the stack rises
heading for the conference room he nearly bumps into katie the receptionist rounding a corner
he carries the have you seen mes into a room has been dedicated solely to those three murders
on an erasure board are the words the oryan room
on one wall is the map mackelway took from hope house over a thousand cities circled by oryan himself
mackelway puts down the stack of have you seen mes
picks up a box of yellow stick pins affixing them to the map one for every faxed face
heres jason corey age
last seen in riverside ca
sure enough oryan had circled riverside ca
on this map
next to it hed written
mackelway sticks a yellow pin in riverside
next the fax concerning anna casitas age
of course oryan had circled macon too
beside it hed written
so macon gets a yellow pin
mackelway continues as got nothing on the last fax
in comes fran
came from a business center at a mariott in dallas
nobody saw who sent it
then they both turn
charlton enters the room
whadda we know about the map
it matches the faxes sir
charlton approaches the map cities circled in red
mackelway continues with the yellow pins one for every have you seen me
of them so far
charlton eyes the stack
have you seen mes
then the map cities
each with a date beside it
whys greenville in blue
mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities
but tiny greenville texas has a blue pin beside it
only city where the date on the fax and the date on the map didnt correspond
he pulls out a fax from the stack a korean boy named steven kim
last seen greenville tx
date of disappearance
fax lists the date of disappearance as august
on the map hes written
the date on oryans map reads beside greenville tx
so greenville gets the only blue pin on this map
charlton notes todays date october
any of these bodies been recovered
two so far
female disappeared from dayton ohio on april
and a male trenton new jersey january th
on the map daytons got written beside it
both have yellow pins in them
but both bodies were found over a thousand miles from where theyd last been seen
one in montana the other in oregon
got autopsy reports on both
charlton looks to the table where autopsy reports and autopsy photos sit two victims weve never seen before
we see the victims photographed face up face down waist and above waist and below
charlton gives the photos a cursory glance nothing more
but we notice something on one of the bodies the male from trenton an odd burn mark on his lower left calf
looks almost symmetrical horizontal across the calf
either of the bodies have the zero on them
charlton frustrated shoves those autopsy photos aside
we look to that map a handful of yellow pins in it
that same map over a hundred yellow pins in it now
its at night
mackelway is alone in here staring at the map
hes been doing a lot of that lately
the stack of have you seen mes has grown as well
every one of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map
some of the have you seen mes have arrived via u
we see a stack of envelopes in a box each sealed in plastic each stamped and addressed to mackelway
mackelway eyes the map puzzling
frans right beside him
assorted papers and leads fill this room including photos he took himself with that minox
he could be sending these to any agent in any office in the country
but hes sending them to you
mackelways been asking himself that same question lately
i dont know
she grabs it
this is agent kulok
a beat whos calling
she hears the answer then covers the phone
to mackelway do you know a professor named daitz
says hes from tulane
ive been trading e mails with him
one moment please
she hands him the phone
a beautiful campus quiet tonight
in its center lies a vast expensive structure the behavioral sciences building
the place goes on forever
mackelway exits an elevator on the b level
corridors octopus their way from these elevators confusing us
every door looks the same
mackelway follows the numbers cant believe how long these hallways are
turns a corner
air can be heard moving through the corridor
but he has found the right number at last
a tiny card fastened to a wall reads dr
emile daitz professor emeritus criminal psychology
it also lists his office hours
mackelway knocks at a door
mackelway opens the door
here sits oryan looking as much like a tweedy professor as he can look
he rises smiles warmly
a tiny cramped hovel
books papers and all of it jammed to overflowing
mackelway sits across from oryan
as daitz the name of this theory was suspect zero
mackelway nods the idea of suspect zero posits that if a serial killer were diabolical enough he could traverse the country without ever being caught killing randomly
theres a collection here in a glass case ancient weapons crude knives swords blow darts
mackelway notes them
tell me what makes a killer catchable
patterns repetition of behavior
now imagine a killer with no patterns no tell tale fetishes no rituals no hidden desire to be caught
a perfect vessel of evil killing without ever leaving a single meaningful clue in his wake
hed be immune to capture wouldnt he
your task forces your forensics teams theyd be helpless
mackelway looks over daitz bookshelf volume after volume about evil the devil the minds of sociopaths the history of serial killers ritual killers tribal rites
is that something you believe in professor
as a citizen of the world its hard not to
wouldnt you say
mackelway cant argue evil is all around us i think a part of the natural order of things
a vast black wave corrupting everything it touches
a virus invades a cell causing it to dysfunction
but did it ever occur to you that something may have invaded that virus something capable of using it to mutate so powerfully
mackelway pauses considering that
just because somethings invisible to us doesnt mean it doesnt exist
mackelway is silent somethings off here
but he cant say for sure just yet what it is
have you ever seen a fifty foot shark
that wasnt just the echo of a question hes heard before it was a red flag
a big one
a shark as we know will only attack humans if he runs out of food
but biologists have theorized that for a shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an endless buffet
hed never run out of food so hed have no need to come to the surface
consequently we would never see him
do you follow
mackelway doesnt well never see one
but that doesnt mean they dont exist
hence suspect zero
mackelway eyes those books on evil then those ancient weapons
casually almost imperceptibly he reaches for his sidearm as oryan continues some of my colleagues think im fascinated with evil
i think the truth is just the opposite evil is fascinated with us
what better vehicle could there be for creating havoc in the world what better instrument than man
were vain were stubborn were deceitful we have an imagination that is limitless in its perversions
of course evil keeps trying to harness us
the more he talks the closer mackelway comes to extracting that gun
then disturbing the silence a knock at the door
oryan rises goes to the door
as mackelway unholsters his gun
oryan opens the door
standing here is a coed with a backpack
she looks confused
i was looking for professor
just like that oryan has bolted past the coed literally tossing her onto mackelway exploding into the hall
mackelway grabs her moves her aside as gently as time allows then blows out of the room
oryan turns a corner vanishing
mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor one door after another for what seems like a mile
but no oryan
then mackelway spots an exit sign
the stairs go six stories up from here
and one story down
a sub basement
its a guess
he descends gun drawn
b looks a lot like b long and endless
we hear air moving around us pipes carrying water the wheezing of an old generator
and on all sides of us dooes a mile of them maintenance offices supply rooms labs
he opens one a janitors supply
no one in here
tries another door
air sucks through a corridor around us
he thinks he hears footsteps around a corner
runs at them
just another vast corridor
then a sound
glass shattering on the floor
he runs down the corridor passing a long metal cage that houses this buildings five furnaces
theyre old and wheezy
its dark behind them shadowy
not a bad place to hide
farther down the corridor is another door made of frosted glass
a sign on it reads neuropsychiatric lab
thats where the sound came from
the lab is dark
he throws on every light switch within reach
and finds himself standing over the shards of what used to be a glass beaker
so hes in the right place
he scans it five rows of work stations ten microscopes per row each with a sink beside it
lining the walls are wide cabinets
but theres also a mini library down here four rows of bookshelves housing medical journals
these are the stacks perfect for hiding behind
he plunges in
doesnt see anyone
then row row row
okay the stacks check out
he walks along the rows of work stations scanning crouching nudging open cabinets
one has been opened bottles of solutions sit inside it
and a jar thats been unsealed its got gauze pads in it
in the back of the room an instructors desk awaits
its tall enough to hide beneath
mackelway slinks around it
kneels down looking into darkness
then a noise
the front door of this lab just swung open
and oryan just bolted out
mackelway emerges from the lab
those furnaces whine beside him on the other side of that cage
but a gate on that cage has been left ajar
five furnaces separated from the sub basement corridor by steel mesh
a few meager bulbs burn
he moves amidst shadow and noise the chugging of engines the humming the wheezing a slight vibration to the floor beneath us
he walks along the edge of furnace
and is assaulted from above
oryan falls on him knocking mackelway hard into the sharp corner of that furnace then down to the ground
mackelways gun skids across the floor
and his mouth suddenly has been covered with gauze
he wants to fight back
but suddenly he finds that his head is swimming
somethings on that gauze
the room is getting fuzzy
we see the belly of a furnace flames heat
then our own blood
mackelways chest was torn open by the corner of that furnace
did we just see the glint of a knife
oryan is leaning over us in utter control
then oryans head turns abruptly at the sound of footsteps
and we hear hey
whatre you doing down here
we turn groggily
two janitors rush toward us keys jangling
its all foggy wavy distorted
we see oryan rise
then everything goes black
mackelways head is ringing
feels like he can hear electricity in the walls around him
slowly he awakens
above him are fluorescent lights
fran is here
mackelway tries to sit up
the shock of pain from his chest stops him
how ya doin
mackelway half nods
his chest is bandaged
were gonna need everything you can remember about this guy tom
physical description any kind of distinguishing characteristics
that was terse
charlton looks pretty pissed off
scratchy where is he
the suspect fled
couple janitors walked in on it
before mack can ask
but the description they gave of him wasnt worth a damn
case youre curious the real professor daitz is on sabbatical out of the country
we cant find him
mackelway nods whose idea was it to meet there
did he ask you to come alone
but you figured youd get a bigger pat on the head if you wrapped this whole thing up without any help is that it
charlton has him pegged
but sir im the one who took the call
agent mackelway was acting under the assumption that id already checked the guy out
were both to blame
that was a major exaggeration if not an outright lie
mackelway eyes her thrown
shes poker faced
charlton however seems unmoved
did agent mackelway attend the interview unaccompanied
reluctantly yes sir
then whose fuck up is it
mackelway eyes her thanks for trying
at charlton it was
poor judgment sir
you wanna work alone start your own agency
mackelway can do nothing but nod
then bailing him out another composite artist enters tools in hand
charlton sighs frustrated
re composite artist lets get you two started
composite artist is ready to begin
a lively sunday service
lots of baptists singing a rousing spiritual
music and praise filling the room
we move along the pews until we came to the very back row
there one man sits
odd expression on his face its as if he cant hear this rousing music or feel the power of this place
people in the next row are stomping their feet
but oryan just drops his head slowly
and begins to weep in the middle of this boisterous congregation
outside an wheel truck can be heard rumbling by with great force
no one else in here seems to hear it
but oryan shuts his eyes tight grieving sobbing
that truck has just thundered by leaving a swirl of debris in its wake
we tilt up from it
to find that those stormclouds once in the distance are upon us now
and they are pulsing with menace
rain wind lightning thunder
like a black wave about to descend
one of those five fax machines begins to ring
then it begins to print
its a sunday
no ones here
but we get a look at whats coming in
same top sheet again attention agent thomas mackelway etc
continue intercut this incoming fax set against a few tableaus of americana
a high school marching band is out here practicing
cheerleaders work on their routines nearby
then a loud whistle sounds
its the band leader who is taking note of the weather gathering overhead
the music from the band ceases
everybody into the gym
the band members start to move
lightning erupts overhead
an unnamed mother emerges onto her back porch where her five year old daughter is having a playdate with a friend
this house borders a wooded area
that wind is starting to make the trees swirl
girls i want you to come in now
startin to rain
the girls sigh disappointed deciding instead to hide themselves inside the tent theyve erected out here
the mother doesnt
continue intercut that fax is now printing page after page
photos with have you seen me
across the top and vitals across the bottom
but this time the transmission isnt stopping at five
there are at least ten sitting in the tray
a soccer games been called in the middle of the second half
parents and their uniformed year olds scatter
rain is pouring down now blown sideways by that wind
that massive gleaming beast that rumbled past the church now rolls right by this park as all of those kids and their parents scramble for the shelter of their cars
the windshield wipers on this truck push water away giving us a clear look at the wet suburban chaos
the faithful in here keep singing their voices full with praise despite the heavy weather outside
they feel safe in here
we move along the pews
until we find oryans
hes not here anymore
oryan leans against the door of the church pelted by that heavy rain
here comes those images again tall wheat whipped by wind and rain
a muzzle flash
the sound of a body slumping hard to the ground
and mackelway looking over us
then were back with oryan
he leans against the door his torment constant
he walks away from the church into that heavy rain
the fax tray has overflown onto the floor more photos more have you seen mes
we hear a last rumble from that wheeler
now there are yellow pins stuck in this map one for every single fax or letter thats been received in the past weeks
have you seen mes represented by pins in cities
its like a national plague
mackelway sits examining it soberly
his chest wound is killing him
we see a thick bandage beneath his shirt
in his pocket now is a bottle of prescription pills
he slugs one down without water his eyes never straying from that map
beside it is a composite drawing from oryan taken from mackelways description
its dead on
this is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch of road
mackelways yukon pulls up
hardly a sound in here
mackelway stands at the register paying for his take out
another night with nothing but his thoughts for company
then agent mackelway
its katie the receptionist from his office sitting by herself in a nearby booth
inexpensive but furnished with all the touches that mackelways apartment lacks flea market stuff lace antique books photos from other eras
lots of candles
they throw shadows of mackelway and katie all over the walls
an odd music fills the room coming from a boom box on the floor
its a rhythmic navajo chant with native american drums providing the pulse
its eery tuneless but awfully authentic
and it fits the intensity of the moment mackelway and katie coupling madly their eyes locked
first time weve seen him shirtless since his injury in that furnace room
a fat bandage covers a quarter of his chest
dried blood can be seen beneath it
theres an intensity in his eyes
the chanting the candles katies body his wound
theyve conspired to bring an intensity into his eyes
its dark primal
and hes been expressing it for an hour without relent
which is why katie gasps one last gasp then rolls to the edge of the bed exhausted
she reaches for that boom box lowers the volume
the chanting dies down into silence
she catches her breath
softly i cant anymore
mackelway eyes her then reaches past her and turns the volume on that boom box back up
the chanting fills the room again
and just like that he has pulled her back onto him urgently
that primal side hasnt been sated yet
mackelway stands at the mirror changing the dressing on that wound across his chest
he unwraps the gauze over that fat bandage soaked through with blood
he pulls the bandage off giving us a better look at the deep gash
dried blood torn skin bruising
looks like hell
but mackelway eyes it calmly
he slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle then cleans the wound with some hydrogen peroxide
as katie appears in the doorway
she eyes him
he shrugs turns
what was that music
a song for dead warriors
i never played it for anybody before
a beat just had a feeling youd like it
the way you stare when you think nobodys looking
rain pounds the window and roof a real storm out there
the boom box is still
the candles are down to their nubs
katie continues to sleep
then his eyes snap open
something just hit him something huge
one of those in the morning ideas that has to be expressed
mackelway stands outside room at a mariott
hes just knocked on the door
fran opens it in a robe
he looks manic
whatre you i cant get a read on this guy
two minutes ago she was sound asleep
why is he sending us all this shit
ive got pins in that map missing people
whats he telling us
she gets it now hes on a combination of painkillers and lack of sleep
or maybe she can sense where hes been
rapid fire he kills a travelling salesman then a school teacher
it doesnt connect
youre a mess
i just didnt think this could wait
fran this guy is trying to point us at something
starkeys part of it
but the other two dont connect
did you drive here
i just need somebody to think this through with me
he wanted to meet me
its like he was interviewing me somehow
what is that
then he kills starkey
so what was he doing with speck and fulcher
you wanna come in
you come out
were right on the edge of this thing
she studies him
a long beat
im going back to bed
youre welcome to the couch if you want
i think you could do with some sleep
he sags a bit
she reaches for his hand
just like that there is contact
it surprises them both
he appreciates it but nows not the time
so he smiles thinly turns and goes
she watches him vanish around a corner
weve been to this house before
mackelway sits in his car at the curb studying the place
rain falls in sheets wind blows
and there he is all alone six in the morning staring at a house
that idea the thought that snapped his eyes open its still working on him
beside him is the drawing that was found in specks car the rendering of a steamer trunk lined with plastic containing body parts in plastic bags
mackelway seems to be fixated on it now
a hand knocks on the front door
jan speck opens up
hoping for good news agent mackelway
mackelway stands in the doorway rain falling behind him
all business mrs
just had a few more questions
mackelway sits at the window looking over the backyard
nothing special out here some trees a swing a storm cellar door
but hes staring at it intently
were not sure why
behind him jan re enters purse over her shoulder umbrella in hand
she grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the coffee table
im sorry i dont have more time agent mackelway
its my pta day
i shouldve called
she smiles tightly i have to go now and heads for the kitchen
once shes there mackelway turns to the back door and unlocks it eyeing that storm cellar outside
she leaves the cup in the sink
he enters the kitchen
i hope i was of some help
a friend of mine said ill feel like this one month for every year we were together
sort of a grieving rule of thumb
have you ever heard that
she half smiles
he turns to the door
there was one other thing did he keep any kind of chemicals around the house
acids that sort of thing
he shrugs dismissing it its nothing
trace elements we found on his trunk
any interest in chemistry
maybe as a hobby
jan pauses for a moment as if recovering a faint memory
then she shakes it off
he lets it go
anyway thank you
and thanks for the coffee
next time ill call first i promise
no trouble at all
mackelway sits in his car
through his windshield we see jan as she backs out of the driveway
she pulls past us giving mackelway as friendly a wave as a grieving widow can give
he waves back
then shes gone disappearing around a corner
mackelway pauses a beat checking his rear view mirror to be sure
then he gets out of his car
mackelway sneaks around the side of the house pulling on a lever to unlatch the side gate
he emerges into the tiny backyard making a bee line for that storm cellar door
he knows he shouldnt be doing this
its beyond risky
but here he is without a warrant
theres no lock on the cellar door
he reaches for it
then he stops himself
just noticed something a neighbor lady visible just over specks backyard fence is looking right at him through her bedroom window
he enters the storm cellar
seven steps leading to a dusty cement floor
mackelway looks around
facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case of disaster cans of food sternos sleeping mats drums of potable water
and long foot lockers
two of them
thats where mackelways eyes go instantly
he hurries to them
throws one open
nothing but sheets and blankets inside
he paws through it
finding nothing else
he throws the other trunk open
he slams it shut looks to those cans of food stacked on shelves
he approaches the shelves jostling cans from their rows making more noise than he ought to
but he finds nothing behind them
except more cans
he approaches those two huge drums of water lugs them aside
behind them is a tall cupboard locked
he pulls at the cupboard door hard
inside a rifle and some boxes of ammo
same as youd find in every other storm cellar in texas
he pauses am i crazy
he emerges from the storm cellar confused
shuts the storm cellar door
then he turns
something else just caught his eye above specks bedroom window is another window a tiny one
he heads for that unlocked back door and enters
he hurries toward the stairs reaches them
then spots something through the entry hall window on the street outside pulling up to the curb
is a police car
that neighbor lady mustve placed the call
and heres mackelway without a warrant
two abilene cops get out approaching the house
mackelway climbs the stairs
if he stays quiet he might just pull this off
a tiny hallway with four doors
up ahead dangling from the ceiling is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold out stairs
and an attic
mackelway tugs on the rope
the fold out stairs drop down out of the ceiling
then he hears hes inside
went in through the back
which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to hell
so he climbs up those fold out stairs
the two abilene cops now circle the house entering through the back porch door just as mackelway did
he pulls up the folding stairs
maybe the guysll do a half assed search and then leave
mackelway looks around lots of dusty junk around here old clothes mementoes
and one more trunk
a steamer trunk
looks just like the one in that drawing rendered by oryan
mackelway races for it
takes out his gun uses the butt end to bust the lock off
throws it open
as we hear the sound of those fold out steps being tugged down from the second floor hallway
and freeze asshole
the cop is just ten feet away most of him still concealed by those steps gun trained right on us
but mackelway seems utterly untroubled
calmly its okay fellas
mackelway drops his gun kicks it toward the cop who doesnt quite know what to make of that
also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across mackelways face
but we understand it now the inside of that steamer trunk is filled with body parts bagged stacked and sealed in ziplocs
powdered lime is sprinkled on them
mackelway stares at once satisfied and sickened
cop can be heard approaching across the attic floor
his gun is drawn
until he too sees whats in there
oh jesus christ
a grammar school class picture of barney fulcher and his nd graders sitting on a mantle
that picture sits beside other photos awards plaques all celebrating fulchers career in colorado education
we turn away from that mantle blowing through this modest living room finding an open door leading down to down the steps we go until we hear the hum of
an old freezer
we turn toward the sound
the freezer is open
a team of forensics guys study it
inside this freezer frozen into a block of ice
are six female hands
no arms no heads
just six slender hands each with a wedding band on the ring finger
mackelway stands in the back of this basement taking it all in
he looks to charlton who is expressionless
fulchers house dusk a close on mackelway as he returns to his yukon satisfied
he is pleased with himself
out of nowhere a firm hand grasps his right shoulder stopping him
mackelway turns abruptly finding himself sandwiched between his yukon and charlton who is now in his face
listen to me cowboy
you have any idea the kind of favors i had to pull with the abilene cops to cover your ass
not allowing him to talk breaking and entering the speck house without a shred of evidence and no not going down without a fight the sample i took from specks
its crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with oil of clove the clove neutralizes the odor of the acid
charlton shakes his head he is not getting through
it was speck not his killer who was hiding something
ever ask yourself why a big shot agent from dallas gets sent down to the wichita falls field office
ill give you two words
hell ill even write it down for ya
charlton leans in to emphasize his point
he pulls out a pad and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using mackelways chest as support
dont talk about it
those words just hang there haunting mackelway
charlton tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into mackelways hand
turns out you were right about this guy
you were right about both of them
but that doesnt change the fact that you went about your business like a rookie
charlton turns the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence throwing a circle of light around the yukon
mackelway watches as charlton puts on his headlights and drives away
a sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of mackelways hand he stares at it as it disappears into darkness
everything yet known about the murders of speck fulcher and starkey fills the wall space in here we see oryans map all those yellow pins
and the one blue one greenville tx
also that drawing of the ghastly ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk
damn thing seems prescient now
agents mill about awaiting a conference
passing by nice job mack
a few other agents also pat him on the back
frans proud of him too we can see it
in fact everyone in here seems to be giving mackelway his due
it all feels good
the agents find seats around the table
charlton takes his place at the head of it
to the assembled okay
weve got a serial killer of serial killers
fran scribbles something on a piece of paper what a genius
slides it over
mackelway conceals the note as still grand standing hes a transient with a history of mental illness
he also happens to think hes a former agent of this bureau
and he is pursuing something that he calls suspect zero
anybody got anything intelligent to say
theres just silence
familiar refrain thats what i thought
mackelway exits the office heading for his yukon
then he stops
because katie is waiting out here leaning against her toyota camry
guy with a wife and kids keepin bodies in his attic
but what is she doing out here
a beat you okay
wondered if you could do me a favor
as katie hands over a manila envelope
mackelway opens it
inside a photo of a heartbreakingly sweet year old girl named karen sumpter with an attached sheet listing her vitals height weight age etc
her names karen sumpter
we were friends
almost reluctantly she disappeared last year
nobody knows where
she was a little wild but not like that
her sadness is obvious
anyway i know youre gonna be in on the autopsies of the girls they found over at specks
figured you might see if one of em was
her voice trails off
this is hard
if it is id like to be the one to notify her folks
out familiesve been friends for years
mackelway puts the envelope under his arm
she starts up the camry
the sky rumbles
he eyes her
for some reason she hasnt pulled away yet
shadows on the wall
and mackelway and katie at it again with the sounds of that eery navajo chanting coming from the boom box
mackelway is studying her staring into her eyes her breathing
shes beginning to climax now
and those eyes go wider
we move into them and we are abruptly slammed again into another set of those odd disjointed images from that unidentified place wet wind in a blur of gray
the sound of our own heavy breathing
a voice rising above the wind pleading please
she is utterly lost now
and that chanting seems to have gotten louder somehow
images flick at us now culled from that book on tribal ritual and trance found at the halfway house a tribesman with eyes rolling back in his head foaming at
mackelway tries to shake it off tries to keep his focus on katie
he buries his head into her neck as tall wheat wet wind
then a muzzle flash and a body slumping to the ground
and suddenly we are in oryan at a desk
he has just remote viewed these images somehow
and theyve left him rattled
its time to get out of this room
a stolen non descript chevy pulls out of a motel room parking lot on to the street
oryan is behind the wheel driving
the radio is blasting anything to shake those images out of his head
which may be why he doesnt notice that theres a siren wailing behind him
he looks in the rear view
a texas state trooper is on his tail
oryan tightens pulling over
the trooper approaches noting the condition of the vehicle
he stands before oryans window
oryans face reveals no evidence at all of anxiety
see your license sir
is there a problem
oryan reaches into his back pocket produces an i
hands it over
trooper eyes it
according to this i
we are now staring at james garvey from littleton colorado
but the trooper doesnt seem too convinced
see your registration please
oryan opens up the glove compartment starts searching through it
but its a stall thats obvious
mind stepping out of the car please
there is no way in hell hes going to let himself get deterred by a state trooper
but he gets out
trooper eyes him with caution
oryan holds his hands in front of his chest keeping them visible to the guy
officer i am carrying something that could be construed as a weapon
id like to hand it over voluntarily so you wont think im trying to conceal anything
would that be all right
what kind of weapon sir
its a hunting knife right here on my hip
trooper notes the shape of that large sheathed knife the one oryan butchered starkey with visible beneath oryans shirt
i was on my way to the woods
my gears in the trunk
trooper doubts it would you like me to hand it to you
i dont know what the procedure is for something like this
take the weapon off your hip place it on the ground and kick it toward me
oryan takes the knife off his hip
the size of it gets some attention from the trooper
what exactly were you planning on hunting sir
a fifty foot shark
oryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and kicks it toward the trooper
trooper slowly kneels down to get it never taking his eyes off oryan
ya know i used to be in law enforcement too
kneeling that right
course this was some years ago
trooper grabs the knife straightens
had anything to drink tonight sir
under medication of any kind
an wheel truck rumbles by distracting oryan
rendering him immobile for a moment
just found myself wondering what was inside that truck
sir im going to ask you to hand me the keys to your vehicle please
oryan opens the car door
we steal a look inside
hes got a gun under the front seat
in a flash that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the forehead of that trooper
trooper knows hes been had
and he knows that hes about to die
mackelway approaches carrying a greasy bag another frito pie and a soda
fumbles with his keys
then he notices something waiting on his doorstep
its a thick file roughly pages in a folder
the word mackelway is written across the front
he leans down opens the folder
the light is spotty out here
but its just strong enough to show us the expression on his face a look of pure awe
the door bursts open
the greasy bag and the soda fall to the floor
mackelway hurries to a phone clutching that file
he dials hurriedly
were in a parking lot outside a wal mart
frans just thrown a bag into her ford taurus
her cel phone rings
she grabs it
he really was fbi
he left his file on my doorstep
fran he was fbi
he can barely believe it himself but we get a look at what was in that file now pages are splayed across mackelways coffee table a copy of an fbi
badge xeroxed memoes test scores citations evaluations reports
the entire career of special agent benjamin oryan
in black and white
im look at his whole history
citations letters of commendation even his fucking test scores from quantico
the guy was an agent
i dont believe it
listen to me
then we hear a beep
that irritated her
mackelway clicks over
read anything interesting lately
mackelways eyes go wide
where are you
oryans just hung up
he stares at the phone then clicks over again re connecting to fran
that was him
he called you at home
call waiting again
call me back
mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye
ive found him you know
zeros a myth
you made him up
myths dont kidnap little boys
sounds like oryan just laughed
then another curve was she pretty
i could hear her moaning right under the navajo chanting
whole thing was downright tribal
whats she look like
that was unsettling
mackelway looks around feeling violated feeling watched
he draws the blinds
double bolts the front door
runs his hand under the window frame for any kind of wire tapping
but mackelway wont allow himself to over react
not now with oryan on the phone
calmly you tell me
he liked that
well stick to business howd ya like my old room
you were there
how the hell did he know that
dyson re paint it
no reply my room
did he re paint it
but you saw what was underneath of course
tell me about it
you tell me
oryan just hung up
mackelway stares at the phone
more rain falls outside
mackelway waits here
pipers in his usual spot in front of the tv
dyson descends the stairs a bit testy tonight
that had some edge
mackelway doesnt reply
mackelway stands in the center of this room dyson in the doorway
that singer down the hall is at it again off key as ever
tonight its the gilligans island theme song
ill be in my office
dyson backs away leaving the door ajar
now mackelway is alone eyeing the tiny bed sink window the leaky ceiling the bucket the peeling paint
this room is heaving with energy
he sits on the bed checks his watch
opposite this bed is that wall re painted in industrial white with the hint of a shape underneath
its what mackelways come here to investigate
oryan sits at a desk eyes closed writing pad at his wrist
on it more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to us
theyre called ideograms
he holds the point of his pen down upon one of them as if receiving information from it and we jump back into mackelway
outside this room we hear that awful toneless singing as it fills the hallway
mackelway rises approaching that re painted wall
he pulls out his keys
checks to see that no ones watching
oryan his pen on that pad his concentration total
we hear the singing the tv the rain that bucket collecting drips
until more lightning throws a burst of white light against that wall
a faint shape becomes visible just beneath the white paint
then it vanishes again
using his keys he begins to scratch away at the white paint
its an irrational thing to do but in the context of the last few days it makes an odd kind of sense
instantly a hint of black can be seen underneath
oryan at that desk
outside he can hear an wheel truck rumble by
he doesnt allow it to distract him
mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall
more blackness appears beneath it
then a sound behind him
the door to this room just shut someone outside mustve pushed it
he keeps scratching at the paint
lightning rages outside
we pull back away from that wall which gives us the opportunity to see something that mackelway is too close to the wall to see for himself
there is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white paint
it is the shape of a vast black wave
a hand painted image as large as this wall itself
mackelway seems tiny by comparison and the mere inch of black that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal
in fact it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow him whole
and he cant even see it
but we can
mustve taken oryan days to paint something this large
a vast black wave
and mackelway without meaning to is about to unleash it
oryan somehow seems to be sensing what is going on in that room
or maybe hes just feeling the power of that wave from memory
or maybe hes just plain crazy
but he and mackelway on some unspoken psychic level are feeding one another
mackelway chips away at that white paint moving rapidly revealing more of the blackness underneath
we push in on it moving past mackelway and his frantic scraping
then were beneath that thin coat of white and somehow weve submerged into the wave itself
a black tidal force of nature
and it is moving
we hear the sounds of it a sucking a yawning as if a tide were drawing back just before exploding forward
the sounds blend in with the wind the rain the drops in that bucket
evil itself on the move gathering might
and were along for the ride
the wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon
it is massive powerful dark
and were right on its forward edge as if surfing it somehow
something just changed
the wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a tsunami
which is when we hear the laughter of a little boy
oryan just heard it too
then new images come at him but they are at first grainy choppy
the sounds of that wave become fainter receding to the background giving way to that sound of laughter and the squeaking of a play set swing
like an old tv slowly gaining reception the image takes a moment to crystallize before us
but then it sharpens were in the play area of a truck stop diner but it feels like were looking at it through a broken lens
the images appear spherical to us surrounded by darkness
before us a year old plays on a swing
call him charlie
mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave its lip
we cant tell if he experiencing something from the past the present the future
we whip around quickly getting a look into the diner itself
there through a window we see a woman presumably charlies mother
her names kathleen
kathleen has her back turned to us because shes busy diapering her nine month old baby at a table
oryan at his desk seems to be getting all of this
and it is agitating him
theres perspiration on his forehead
the sound of that wave is still a presence
charlie looks up at us as he swings
his smile is pure genuine
we whip around for another look at kathleen
shes still busy with that diaper
then we look back to charlie
oryan keeps his eyes shut his focus total
but every part of him is becoming tense
mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort
more of that wave is visible to him
but he doesnt step back to take that in
that swing is now empty dangling gently
and were running we know not where
oryans foot starts to tap anxiousness discomfort
toward a parking lot
but we do so smoothly without effort as if being carried by that relentless black wave
then another sound bleeds in
the banging of the diners back door which leads on to that play area
and we hear a horrified yell charlie
charlie where are you honey
honey are you out here
the sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio being taken over by the sounds of that awful wave
mackelway suddenly stops
as if some electric charge had just shot through him short circuiting him into stillness
he begins to step away from the wall
oryan has lost the pulse the connection that had allowed him inside what we just witnessed
he rises hurrying into a tiny bathroom
we stay on that writing pad trying to decipher these lines and squiggles the ideograms as we hear the sounds of oryan retching
mackelway sits on the bed looking at what hes just uncovered
an awesome sight
his head is pounding worse than ever
so he reaches for the vicoden
weve stepped out of that subjective pov now
kathleen grabs her infant distraught as another massive wheel truck blows by us in the distance
oryan washes his face eyes his reflection in the mirror scrutinizing himself
on the wall opposite mackelway that huge black wave is now entirely visible to him
bits of chipped white paint litter the floor
a vast black wave
it fills the whole wall
mackelway eyes his watch
its one oclock in the morning
hes been in here for four hours
that seems impossible
a box slamming down hard on a desk
we are a
mackelway is in here by himself angry
he reaches into that box
he crosses to the map
he starts pulling out the yellow pins weve grown accustomed to seeing on this map replacing them with the black ones tossing the discards onto the floor
as mackelway replaces pin after pin
mackelways face as he backs away from that huge map
ten minutes have passed but mackelway has seen a revelation
we can read it on his face
he eyes the map
which has now been stuck with over black pins one for each city with a have you seen me to its credit
and those black pins seen from a distance form a pattern we werent expecting something that never quite took shape when the pins were yellow
looks like a big black wave
and thats just what it is
black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that oryan had painted onto the wall of his room a massive wave of darkness gathering strength
but this black wave is consuming america
mackelway stares at it awed even a bit frightened
the thing seems vast unstoppable
a black wave pure malevolence covering the states like a fog
one blue dot lies in its center that blue pin in the heart of greenville texas
then piercing the silence got one of those pins in denton yet
charlton leans in the doorway
oryan was spotted there tonight
took a squad car and a side arm from a state trooper
bout an hour later a five year old boy was abducted roughly a mile up the interstate
whats this guy doing here
the vehicle was found in an abandoned lot
were establishing a perimeter around the city now
knows already but the trooper wasnt hurt
what makes you so sure
charltons at a loss
until mackelway gestures to the table where he has laid out oryans entire fbi file
every memo citation letter i
charlton eyes it calmly
hes not going to let his jaw drop not with mackelway watching
so he just nods
an agent can just be deleted
looks like it
its a depressing reality
i couldnt understand it before pushing specks car onto the state line
makes sense now
he wanted to make the case federal
hes drawing us in
why would he do that
so wed be paying attention when he found suspect zero
ya know what
im getting extremely tired of hearing that word
in fact thats gonna be policy from now on
sir profile the guy
hes straight outta quantico
all hes doing is working a case like we would
hes not kidnapping little kids hes chasing the guy whos doing the kidnapping
look at the map
whatre you saying that all these abductions are the work of one guy
do you know how fucking insane that is
over mackelway not lets try something that actually makes sense he sends in these faxes picks off three scumbags
so well think exactly what youre thinking right now that weve got a friend out there somebody willing to take out the garbage for the rest of us
and its all horse shit
what if it isnt
what if there really is a zero out there and oryans the one guy whos got a shot at him
just blew his top fucks sake mackelway when did you start buying into this guy
mackelway lets the silence hover
quietly hes smarter than we are
speak for yourself
charlton heads for the door
what if i told you i knew how to catch him
and what if i told you that the way id catch him involved sitting in a dark room with nothing in front of me but a pad of paper
until id tapped into some kind of
energy out there
the collective unconscious
if i told you i thought i could target and
locate him without ever leaving this building what would you say
id say youd watched too many x files
yever heard of a project called icarus sir
mackelway tosses over a few pages from oryans file
agents trained to see distant locations using nothing but the mind
they called it remote viewing
charlton eyes the pages without comment
army stole it from the soviets
the bureau stole it from the army used it to track serial killers
a beat experimental program
oryan was the first agent they recruited
good for him
charltons waiting except it worked
its how he drew this mackelways referring to that drawing a steamer trunk filled with ghastly ziploc bags hed never been in that house before
he just saw what was in there the bureau taught him how
same one that deleted him
same one thats trying to catch him now
does anything about all this strike you as odd
charlton studies him a long beat measuring him
im going to denton at oh six hundred
you can take the day off
with that hes gone leaving mackelway alone in here
nothing to look at but that black wave
he hears charlton leaving the building
he slams another vicoden then hears a phone ring
hes not moving
let voice mail get it
until he hears the sound of a fax coming in
follow him mackelway hurries through the office as the sound of that fax grows louder
the fax has spun out a single sheet
no top sheet
but heres another face another victim with the customary have you seen me
across the top
a young african american boy lloyd simms age
last seen greenville texas
date of disappearance
the transmission ends
mackelway eyes those vitals
they mean something
he re enters and approaches that huge map
theres that wave of black pins with the one blue pin in its center greenville with a written beside it
mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin replaces it with a black one
now the wave is complete
weve seen this truck before several times in fact
it rumbles along the highway
we dont see whos driving but we do see whos in the passenger seat
its charlie five years old whose abduction we just witnessed
he sleeps fitfully
a mans hand can be seen edging into frame the driver
he picks up a cassete shoves it into the tape deck
and out comes the sound of barney the dinosaur
oh silly songs get sillier when you hear them once again and maybe youre hearing an echo or maybe its only a friend
the truck continues to rumble along
fran pauses outside the oryan room
where mackelway sleeps on a chair
poor guy was here all night
she regards him
then her eyes find that map and the gaping black wave across it
a horrible image
she studies mackelway again almost tenderly until does he listen to you
she turns startled
heres charlton right behind her
and shes been caught
watching mackelway sleep
its not a strength of his
im noticing that lately
truth is she doesnt like charlton
or trust him
im not so sure
a beat you oughtta sit him down remind him how a chain of command works
hes fine sir
talk to him
with that hes gone
fran watches as he heads for the front door
she looks back to mackelway
he awakens with a start
thinking no ones watching he pops another vicoden
fran enters feeling slightly dirty from that exchange
mackelway checks his watch as a few agents exit the suite
they going to denton
but not you
sitting in on two autopsies
heads for the door stiff
she looks at those oryan fbi documents now her first time seeing them
she leaves it at that
hes about to exit when are they male or female
females logan utah and decatur alabama
neither city is represented with black pins on that map
she slides over a packet of photos two female victims photographed in separate morgues face up face down waist and above waist and below etc
mackelway eyes them then leaves the room
we stay with fran
taking in that oryan fbi file
it troubles her
mackelway returns carrying the by envelope that katie gave to him
re oryans file so is this what happens when an agent spins out
he gets deleted
the lucky ones get sent to wichita falls
she breathes out an ironic laugh
he hands over the envelope opens it
inside that photo of karen sumpter
mackelway didnt pay much attention to it before
fran eyes the photo then the vitals
friend of the receptionist missing for about a year now
i told her id let her know if the body ever turned up
fran doesnt look up from the photo
her names katie
she half smiles you mean the one youve been fucking
he shrugs confirming nothing wishing fran werent quite so smart
she puts the photo back into the envelope
i see you got the blue pin out of greenville
kid named simms
that confused her
re sumpter no
i meant her
that confused him
whatre you talking about
did ya look at her vitals
she hands him the material on karen sumpter
he grabs the material looks at it for the first time karen sumpter age
eyes blu hair blnd
last seen greenville tx
date of disappearance
mackelway looks to the conference table that huge stack of faxes all those helpless faces
the one on top is the one that came in last night lloyd simms age
last seen greenville texas
date of disappearance
at last a pattern
mackelway grabs the simms fax hurries out of the room
nearest agent is grieves
mackelway hands him the fax
need an address on this fax line
grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now it never yields their suspect but kay
mackelway leans back in to the oryan room
oryans in greenville
what makes you think so
thats where zero is
frans a blank lloyd simms october
karen sumpter october
both disappeared from greenville
still no reply zero comes back to the same spot once a year
todays the th
when did we establish that zero was real
oryan thinks so
thats the million dollar question and it hangs there
mackelways about to answer
when he stops himself
just noticing something
that morgue photo from logan utah theres a burn mark on the lower left calf of the victim
weve seen such a mark before on another autopsy photo
ive seen this before
he doesnt answer just hurries to a thick box of other autopsy files and photos
starts rifling through them
until he finds the one weve seen before
the body from trenton
he extracts it
he lays the two photos side by side
looks to fran
same burn mark
she leans in i saw it before but it didnt register
fran eyes the photos
no doubt about it they both have the same burn mark on the lower left calf a symmetrical almost horizontal stripe across the flesh
he burns them
almost looks too symmetrical to be a burn
re logan victim theyre autopsying her this morning
she gets the idea find out where the hell this mark on the leg came from
fax number traces back to a copy center on i
mackelway eyes his watch i called
they dont open for another hour
mackelway looks to fran
shes not entirely sold yet
but shes getting there
mackelway plows along i
ahead of him one hell of an ugly storm front seems to be waiting
thick black clouds
mackelways driving right into the teeth of them
a copy place right off i
mackelways yukon is parked in front
mackelway stands opposite a day manager harried eyeing a copy of the composite drawing of oryan
re oryan naah
i never saw that guy in here
he sent a fax from this location bout seven oclock this morning
were closed at seven
are your faxes programmable
could he have paid last night to have it sent this morning
but that costs extra
were you here last night
havent done nights since i got promoted
mackelway eyes the guy
then hears a cel phone ring
mackelway grabs his cel backing away from the counter
into cel mackelway
fran is at a phone in the morgue
the logan utah body lies on the table
its not a burn
its a freezer burn
theres crystallization in the blood stream
the blood never clotted in the wound
its a freezer burn
im having the other body shipped out the guy from trenton
well see if hes got the same thing
mackelway pauses thinking
he keeps the bodies in a freezer then buries them
that was a question
he cant do any better
if he kept them in a freezer theyd have marks like this all over
mackelway nods that made sense
the noise of the interstate doesnt make things any easier
a huge truck rumbles by
mackelway eyes it absently
then a bolt hits him on the side of the truck is a trademark ever frost
this truck is hauling ice cream
things just began to click
he has hit end before she can reply
heads to his yukon
fran eyes the phone that was odd
a huge lay out with a diner rest stop and gas station
mackelway sits at a table by a window
fifty massive trucks in this lot some refrigerated most not
this diner is big enough to seat truckers a few families and folks who just like the buffet gravy covers just about every entree
mackelways been here for hours
a waitress comes by
you want some more breakfast honey or are we just rollin right on into lunch
just some coffee thanks
might hit the buffet in a bit
meatloafs lookin good today
he smiles thanks
she turns away
that leaves him alone again scanning not even sure hes in the right place
cel phone rings
he grabs it
shes driving talking into the cel
whatre you doing
whatre you doing
driving to greenville
knows already why would you be doing that
i think agents are safer when they have some company
i can send along katie if youd rather
he appreciates a good jab
im at the truck stop we traced
off the im bout a half hour out
ill order some lunch for you
hear the meatloafs good today
she half smiles
she likes him despite herself
he half smiles puts the cel phone away
he likes her despite himself
then a man passes by him a trucker
lets call him vic
all we see as he passes is the tattoo on his forearm a cobra
keys jingle on his belt hook
he wears a sleeveless down vest and a god bless america cap
mackelway turns but vics already past us
something about him attracts mackelways attention
the walk the attitude
so mackelway is watching without really knowing why as vic crosses the parking lot heading for his rig
its a beast
vic climbs in unaware that hes being watched
mackelway looks away chiding himself for allowing the guy to distract him
that waitress comes by with more coffee
mackelway smiles looking absently out the window again
and sees a little boy of in the cab of vics rig
but this little boy is screaming struggling to get out of his car seat until vic grabs the kid by the shoulders roughly
all of this visible through the windshield
mackelway locks in on the kid
vics rig pulls out
the kid pounds on his window
looks like hes saying lemme out of here
i want my mommy
he might be little charlie we cant tell from here
but we can see that vic is yelling at him shut up
and we can see that vics truck is refrigerated
hes hauling dairy products
on a normal day mackelway might shrug this off as coincidence
he might not be so vigilant
this isnt a normal day
he races for the door
mackelway backs out in the yukon trying to keep a visual on vics truck
another wheeler pulls in front of him blocking his view entirely
he honks loud pulls around that other wheeler heading for the exit of the lot
just spotted vics rig again
he follows vics rig out of the lot and onto a road approaching i
but there are three cars between them mackelway cant get a clean look at vics license plate
vic approaches the interstate
so do the three cars between them
vic passes the interstate on ramp
the three cars turn on to it
putting mackelway right on vics tail
he grabs his cel dials
this truck has license plates from ten states
this is mackelway
i need a run down on a plate
texas delta romeo victor alpha
he puts the cel down but doesnt hang up
vic just made a turn onto a vast dirt lot
a huge banner overhead reads founders day carnival
there are several big rigs parked here but the vast majority of the vehicles we see are garden variety cars and suvs
a few pick ups
there are rides at this carnival pony rides a ferris wheel and a huge ring of barbeques each fired up and cooking
must be a thousand people in attendance today
vic parks his rig
mackelway hangs back watching vic gets out of the rig
from here we can see that that year old boy is still stick in his car seat and he is still screaming and flailing
vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say behave or else
then vic disappears into the crowded carnival
he gets out of the yukon approaching vics truck
we cross he reaches vics truck looks in the passenger window
theres the five year old kid tears streaming down his face
we still cant tell if its charlie
mackelway reaches for the passenger side door
and he cant shoot his way in
he looks to the kid inside you okay
kids a blank kid
you okay in there
the kid doesnt respond just seems spooked
mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd
vics still visible to us but he wont be for long
at the kid ill be back
mackelway heads into the carnival
he begins running now past the table where ladies are selling tickets for the rides and games past the cotton candy guy
because we just lost sight of vic
mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques upsetting a tray or two
then he stops
theres the ferris wheel
was that vic on the other side of it
mackelway takes off
but mackelway thinks he sees the guy
heading back in the direction of the parking lot
he runs past the pony rides past a funhouse past a popcorn machine past those ladies selling tickets
he hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance
but he bursts through runs into the dirt parking lot around cars and big rigs then turns a corner and runs smack into benjamin oryan
the shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to recover from it
but here he is
oryan five feet away
mackelways speechless still trying to recalibrate himself
a second ago he was chasing a possible zero
now hes face to face with oryan
and oryan isnt running
in fact he almost seems amused
must be quite a moment for you
mackelway still hasnt spoken until whatre you doing here
waiting for you
which is when mackelway realizes that he is standing right in front of vics rig
but he wasnt expecting what comes next vic has returned to the rig with a woman beside him
turns out shes his wife
vic opens the passenger side door unclasps that five year old kid from his seat
the kid dives into the womans arms
i told you shed be here
to woman hes been a brat all morning
mother hugs son
which means that mackelway has misread things badly
and oryan is a witness to it hence the grin
at oryan hands up
oryan raises his hands
mackelway reaches for his cuffs
oryans hands are cuffed in front of him
mackelway leads him to the yukon opens a door for him and puts him into the backseat
a few lookie lous strain for a peek
mackelway gets in hits the ignition
reaches for his cel phone
starts to dial
disappointed awfully conventional dont ya think
apprehend the fugitive then call it in for your pat on the head
sorry to disappoint you
mackelway continues to dial
ill get over it
flat but im not too sure that little boy will
that just stopped mackelway mid dial
minor test what little boy
the one from the diner in denton
you know where he is
i can find him
same way i found starkey and speck and fulcher
that rang a bell
i need someplace quiet someplace i can concentrate
and your assurance that once hes located we go get him together
i cant do that
then i cant help you
mackelway disgusted pulls out of the lot
through sparse traffic heading for an interstate on ramp
im talking about uncompromised justice
no hiccups in a chain of evidence that can set a monster free
you of all people should be able to appreciate the value of that
wheres the boy
i wont be doing this much longer
actually this is the end of it
come to accept that
but there is one last thing to anger rising wheres the boy oryan
do we have an understanding
mackelway pulls the car over under an i overpass
and out comes his gun pointed right at oryans forehead
enough of this shit
wheres the boy
oryan cant help it
this is good
sort of thing youd never find in a procedural manual
it tells me i was right about you
cocking the hammer i will kill you oryan
but we have work to do first
wheres the goddamn kid
then that cel phone rings
must be fran
dont pick that up
mackelway eyes him are you kidding
it rings again
a panicked offer this is the guy who put all those pins in that map of yours
and i can take you to him
mackelway grabs the phone
where is he
silence where is he
silence punctuated by ring
then oryan smiles
and points to his own forehead
mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh
he punches the talk button taking his eyes off oryan for a split second
what follows is a blur oryan lunges forward like an animal throwing his cuffed wrists over mackelways head yanking mackelway out of his seat with a violent tug
the gun falls
we pop outside the yukon pulling back
obscuring our view of whats going on inside that truck
that cel phone continues to ring
we keep pulling back under this sparsely trafficked overpass rain falling
the cel phone stops ringing
continue pulling back taking in the expanse of highway cars rolling by without a hint of the peril beneath them
fran has just arrived
she scans the place
doesnt see mackelway
she reaches for that cel phone again
the room feels like its swimming
his arms and legs are bound
his mouth has been gagged
and he is staring into his own reflection
he lies on his side
a mirror has been propped on the floor just inches from his face leaving him with nothing to look at but himself
he strains against the ropes but theres no give to them
hes helpless powerless
and that mirror is forcing him to watch it all with perfect clarity
a few feet away oryan sits in a chair calmly peeling the skin off of an apple with that huge hunting knife of his
a candle flickers on the floor by his feet
are you afraid
there was a delight to that question we can see it on oryans face
mackelway of course cant reply due to the gag
but the answers obvious
quoting himself as daitz imagine a killer with no patterns no tell tale fetishes no rituals of any kind
no hidden desire to be caught
a perfect vessel of evil
all mackelway can see is his own reflection the fear in his eyes bouncing off a mirror thats only inches away
and the name we give that killer
again are you afraid
slowly he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on the floor
itd be customary at this point to start praying
i hear a lot of that
havent seen too many answers though
i wouldnt hold my breath waiting for another janitor to break in here and save you either
mackelway tries to speak
oryan pulls the gag from his mouth just long enough for mackelway to say wheres the boy
oryan jams the gag back into his mouth angrily
re the mirror my my
must be extremely satisfying to watch yourself say something so heroic
im almost envious
casually the boys under the bed
are you afraid
mackelway absorbs that watches himself absorb it then looks to that bed
cant quite see whats under it
oryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade
i know what youre thinking there is pain coming
am i going to take it like a man
let me put you at ease you wont
none of them do
men women children
they all weep they all beg
they pass out they piss themselves
they attempt negotiation you wouldnt believe how many men have lain right where youre lying right now grown men with wives and children back home offering all kinds of sexual
gratification in exchange for a five minute reprieve
are you afraid
of course no reply then theres that moment when they realize theres nothing left to be negotiated
theyre just mine
and theyre helpless
and the look in their eyes the level of surrender
well its almost pornographic
i put this mirror here because i dont want you to miss it
are you afraid
with that he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame
it is red hot
even looking at it is painful
but mackelway cant look at anything else
how about now
just like that that red hot knife is an inch from mackelways face
the heat alone makes his head jerk back
wisps of smoke rise from its edge
and mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it
he struggles against these ropes to no use
a guttural sound comes out of him
are you afraid
oryans hand lashes out a bit leaving the sizzling knife just under mackelways chin
the anticipation of pain is unbearable
and mackelway is reading it in his own eyes
two things hit at once this monster is about to torture me to death
please god dont let me give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry
oryan moves the blade again this time an eighth of an inch above mackelways right arm
the heat from it is so incendiary that mackelways shirt begins to smoke
mackelways shirt is officially on fire now
the pain is awful
he stares at his own reflection
as tears begin to flow from his eyes
he cant stop them
top of his lungs are you afraid
that bounces off the walls
mackelway shuts his eyes tight cant watch this anymore
infuriated open your eyes
open your eyes goddammit or ill cut the fucking lids off
mackelway opens his eyes forced to watch himself break
deep sobs shudder through him as
oryan digs that red hot blade into mackelways arm mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection yes i am terrified
he shrieks the sound muffled by that gag
with his body able to do no more than spasm he jerks his head forward smashing it into that mirror
the mirror shatters obliterating the image
and everything goes black
then more images swarm at us
were helpless to beat them back a ext
darkness unidentified time a out of a soupy darkness a dreamlike spin on a location weve visited before it is the wheat field that oryan has remote viewed countless times
only this time we see it through mackelways fever or nightmare
we see the tall wheat the wet wind familiar images to us
all to the pounding chant of the navaho
but then other images enter this world
theyre jarring that tribesman eyes rolling back foaming the mouth dancing around a fire in a frenzy
then a curtain of wheat obscures him revealing fran and katie giggling crooking fingers as if inviting us
looks like theyre naked
but as we approach them they seem to get farther away
then that curtain of wheat that separates us from them reveals charlton extending a hand to us warmly congratulating us for something a job well done when mackelway himself is
hunting through the wet wheat gun drawn
then looks to see who hes just shot
he turns it over
and is staring at himself lying dead on the ground in the mud and pouring rain
it is a moment of shock and horror giving way as we
on oryan at a desk sitting upright making notes on a pad
his back turned to us
time has passed
we dont know how much
or maybe were dead or dreaming
its hard to say
but theres oryan at a desk
mackelways eyes are open
his forehead has a bright red raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror
but the brain is functioning
it starts running through a check list
im in the same motel room
im on a bed
no its just my right arm
but it is searing
the check list continues my mouth is sore but that gag has been removed
and my arms are unbound
maybe i am dead
mackelway tries to move his hand
it takes some effort
but he puts it before his face
he stares at it
then he notices his shoulder
a fat bandage has been wrapped around it covering up the source of that searing pain
looks as though a nurse had tended to it
but this sure as hell isnt a hospital
then oryan turns facing us
mackelway recoils without meaning to
but oryans demeanor has changed
that look of possessed malevolence its gone now
we cant imagine why
softly stand up
mackelway pauses rewinding that one
its over now
can you stand
mackelway is still bracing for torture or at least combat
so hes a step behind
we really do have to go
oryan rises crossing toward us
even unbound mackelway is expecting another onslaught
but all oryan does is drop a piece of paper onto mackelways lap
its another drawing of a ranch house with a windmill in the background
crude but just specific enough
mackelways still too unwound to speak
this is where hell be
with the boy
a beat zero
hes coming home today
were going to be there
mackelways starting to understand now
this was an act
that stuns him
youre ready to come with me now
youve been in the pit
mackelway eyes him utter disbelief
oryan smiles warmly like a drill sergeant at the end of basic sorry i was so hard on you but it had to be done
can we shake on it
instead mackelway simply explodes it is a blur faster than a blur but mackelway rises with an animal roar knocking oryan flat on his back
then mackelway is upon him
all the helplessness all the horror the images of watching himself in that mirror the sounds of his own uncontrollable sobbing
they erupt now into violence
it is an overwhelming force
oryan cant begin to fight it off
mackelway has one hand on oryans throat
the other hand comes down like a sledgehammer
the sounds coming out of mackelway are savage barely human
hes out of control
oryans eyes roll back
mackelway now puts both hands around this fuckers throat
hes going to kill him right here
hes going to squeeze the life from him
this is a mackelway weve never met before
his eyes are wild hateful even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out of oryans throat
then mackelway is distracted for just a second
less than a second
by a glimpse of that shattered mirror his own twisted image
he looks away from it refusing to be distracted determined to kill this guy
then those eyes drift back to the mirror again
and he sees his reflection a hardened crazed stranger
his hands without warning release their grip
oryan gasps for air
his face has been bloodied
mackelway rises disgusted removing a great weight from oryans chest
that makes breathing a little easier
mackelway crosses to a tiny cheap bathroom
theres a mirror in here too
that fat bandage on his shoulder stares back at him
he tugs at it doesnt unravel it just yanks it off his arm revealing a hideous wound
its a zero with a slash through it
now everything clicks oryan was branding him
initiating him with that red hot knife
mackelway stares at the wound his eyes lifeless
he splashes some water on his face his mind still reeling
then oryan appears in the doorway
he too looks like hell face bloodied throat red eyes watering
a long beat
mackelway eyes him incredulous
oryan nods then places that drawing of the ranch house on the sink
mackelway eyes it
then oryan stuns him
by laying mackelways gun atop the drawing without a word
mackelway eyes the gun then grabs it and points it right at oryans face just inches away
were tight on mackelways hand
it trembles with rage
but oryan looking right down the barrel seems unafraid
in fact he smiles utterly confident
then re gun soon
but not yet
he eases mackelways hand down thus lowering the gun
then oryan turns grabs mackelways car keys and heads for the front door
mackelway stands rigid
he raises the gun
maybe ill just shoot this fucker in the back
then those images come at us again out of nowhere
out of a gray soupy swirl coming slightly into focus wet wind tall wheat our own heavy breathing as we run
and that non descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the sound of oryans voice static filled wobbling please
im begging you
that was clear enough
a gun rises
we seem to be holding it
then those images vanish and we are jolted back to mackelway tightens
oryans out the door
this vision that keeps getting clearer and clearer
what the hell does this it mean
down go two more vicodens
a huge storm devours scenery on both sides of us
mackelway sits no expression at all on his face still recovering from what happened in that room
then tell me about icarus
oryan eyes him
the sky is black
there were five of us
in the program
mackelways all ears
wed come in in the morning have a cup of coffee talk about the yankees
then youd go to your room with your pen and
your pad of paper always alone and youd try to lock in
son of sam
john wayne gacy
he might be driving his car or having a beer or brushing his teeth
or cutting someones eyes out
that was said flatly matter of factly
if you did it right you got all of it the way it sounded
the way it smelled
those people were looking up at you begging you for mercy
it was like being god
a beat except youre not
because you cant do a thing for them
cant make it stop
youre just watching helpless
they wired us into this current the five of us darkness the pit itself
we were plugged right into it
but nobody taught us how to shut it off
we were just men
and we saw things men shouldnt see
agony torture evil and it never shut off
even now its still there
they all wind up like you
the other agents
theyre dead now
mackelway doesnt reply
they broke down
then they opted out
mackelways a blank killed themselves
after a while those conversations about the yankees became impossible
mackelway lets that sink in as he stares at passing head lights
then im sorry
he appreciates it
the windshield wipers beat back rain
oryan continues to drive
then were here
mackelway sits up
oryan pulls over at weve seen this place before
that is weve seen it in oryans drawing which lies on the dashboard before us a ranch style house with a windmill in the backyard
oryan pulls over
rain pounds on the roof and hood
mackelway studies the house
then his eyes shift briefly to the drawing
cant bring you in with me
you know that
oryan shrugs then raises his hands cuff me
the cuffs are lying on the floor in the back seat
mackelway reaches back to grab them
a golden opportunity for oryan to club the guy
but oryan remains still
mackelway grabs them
then he stops
simply has to ask those faxes the have you seen mes
how many of em is he actually responsible for
oryan lays it right out all of em
mackelway nods sobered
cuffs oryan to the steering wheel and approaches the house
the place is in some disrepair untended lawn chipping paint etc
mackelway looks through the kitchen window
no ones visible
he walks around the side of the house
oryan watches as mackelway vanishes
this is a moment of opportunity
with his free hand he reaches into his pocket grabbing a lighter
mackelway moves cautiously being pelted by rain
but now he can see inside the living room of this home its a bit of a time warp plastic on the furniture an old radiator pictures on the mantle
in antique frames
and an old lady leaning over a record player
tough to hear whats playing were outside and that storm is pounding but it sounds like glenn miller
theres also an old tv in here wizard of oz is on it
the lady is frail thin
she also happens to be blind
cataracts on her eyes
her names delia
mackelway watches her
as she exits the room heading for the kitchen
he moves to another window
oryan keeping his eyes on that house now lights the lighter
and holds the flame up to the chain connecting his hand cuff to the one on the steering wheel
the chain begins to heat up
mackelway watches as delia makes her way into the kitchen
it too is from another era the dishwasher stands in the center of the floor connected to the sink with a long hose
the refrigerator the table the toaster all old
the oven is an antique too
delia crosses to it grabs a towel opens it
and pulls a cake from it
she brings the cake to the kitchen table moving well for a lady who cant see
on the table is an old fashioned bakers frosting tube
she grabs it using her hands to orient herself
and begins to write on the cake in frosting
mackelway cant see the top of that cake but we can
the first letters in beautiful cursive read happy bir
its a work in progress
oryan has that handcuff chain glowing now
we dont know if hell have time to break the thing
until the passenger side door is opened abruptly
its his birthday isnt it
heres mackelway who now gets an eyeful of what oryans doing with that lighter
oryan pockets it a bit sheepishly
mackelway decides to ignore the whole thing
he comes home on his birthday
then delias front door swings open
aloud delighted darling
delia stands in the open doorway an old blind lady talking to the dark rainy street
that confuses them
until we hear the rumble of an wheel truck
it turns a corner onto this street
mackelway turns now
weve seen this truck before
a monstrous rolling beast
and mackelway straightens reaching for his sidearm
behind him delia smiles excitedly almost dancing
but that smile soon leaps from her face
as she hears the sound of that wheeler braking abruptly its tires locking up on the wet road
mackelway gets a look at the driver now a wiry sinewy man of
lets call him zero
their eyes lock until zero throws his rig into gear again and begins to rumble down the street
that truck is rumbling away
mackelway turns racing for the yukon leaving delia at the door
mackelway jumps in to the yukon unlocking those cuffs
he accidentally burns himself on the super heated chain
re burn fuck
cuffs are unlocked now
oryan starts up the yukon
oryan drives pursuing the big rig
mackelway gets on his cel phone dials
rain falls in sheets all around them
urgently this is mackelway
im travelling north on
grove road approaching i in greenville
request immediate back up
pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated truck texas license plate alpha the yukon swerves hard to the right narrowly avoiding the tail end of zeros rig as he swings it
into our path
mackelway drops the phone
grabs it again
alpha tango foxtrot alpha
zero does it again swinging the rear of his rig across the road forcing oryan to swerve hard
the yukon gets shoved on to a curb then clunks down to the street again
then zero jams on the brakes
mackelways eyes go wide
at oryan brakes
oryan jumps on the brakes
the yukon screeches to a stop throwing itself into a sideways slide
it bangs passenger side first into the rear of the truck breaking a window
mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass
then the rig pulls away again
zeros rig turns hard onto a service road running parallel to the interstate
mackelway is locked in on that truck
into cel phone again travelling due west now
dont see a name
its a service road running parallel to the then mackelway freezes mid word
he just saw something that made his jaw drop on the other side of this road is a field of tall wheat
time seems to stop
his blood feels like it just congealed
tall wheat in a wet wind
he has been here before
he has seen it before
and so has oryan
mackelway just stares slack jawed as that wheat whips past them
the feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he forgets about zero and the rig and the kid
everything has just crystallized in a horrible way
he knows that he is going to wind up in that wheat field somehow with oryan
and oryan will be begging him for mercy
oryan guns the yukon attempting to cut in front of the rig
zero swings wide sending the yukon into a curb this time
that shreds their front tire
which means that in one minute this car is going to be undriveable
so if they dont stop zero from hitting that interstate now zero will be gone
absently whatre you
cant let him hit the interstate
mackelway braces himself as oryan guns his car up the left side of the rig shredded tire and all
then he pulls right in front of the rig
at about m
and he jams on the brakes
zero swerves out of instinct
it throws the rig into a vicious jack knife
the van whips around in front of the cab swatting the yukon away like a fly
were inside the yukon as it rolls mackelway and oryan look like tinker toys
the torque pulls zeros rig onto its side sliding hard
metal hits concrete sending up a shower of sparks
the yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road upside down
mackelway alive and awake strains to look out the busted windshield
what he sees is hard to discern but it looks like zeros rig is lying flat on its side
and of course he is mere yards from that wheat field
the rigs cab lies drivers side down
but the passenger side door pops open
and zero pokes through it his eyes immediately scanning that tall wheat
oryan who blacked out for a second now opens his eyes getting the picture in a hurry
zero leaps to the ground rolls and rises
only thing in his hand is a tire iron
carrying it he sprints into the wheat field vanishing
mackelway bursts out of the yukon in pursuit
oryans door is stuck
mackelway doesnt stop to help him just barrels across the street
just then a state ranger car arrives
over his shoulder running get the van open
hes got a kid in the van
state ranger hurries out of his squad car
mackelway sprints into the tall wheat
oryan with a grunt gets his door open
now he too disappears into that wheat field
tall wheat in a stiff wet wind and not a drop of moonlight to guide us
mackelway plunges in gun drawn
no idea where hes going
except hes been here before
hes seen it
and there is a feeling of inevitability to all this its haunting
hes practically blind in here
cant see five feet in front of him
nothing but the sound of his own breathing
that too was presaged
ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock away
mackelway keeps running deaf and blind
oryan is running nearby but they cant see or hear one another
sides of beef lie on their sides
ranger plunges in
then the ranger spots in the back of the van a false wall that used to hide a secret compartment
the crash has collapsed part of the false wall
frozen air blows out in wisps
he climbs over those carcasses fast as he can
mackelway keeps going running blind
then another sound up ahead
sounds like the noise of someone stumbling
the sound does not repeat itself
he continues along step by cautious step now
ranger gets over the last of the carcasses pulling himself up to the now open compartment
first thing we see is a refrigeration rod the one that was responsible for those freezer burns
then we see charlie bound
hes trembling with cold but hes alive
his leg presses up against the rod
mackelway inching along heart pounding
he hears a noise to his left
whips around gun poised
but its nothing
the wheat almost sounds like its laughing at him
then that tire iron lashes out from the right
it catches mackelway with horrific force shattering his wrist and sending that gun flying into the wheat
before mackelway can react zero is upon him
frans ford skids to a stop outside the van
just as the ranger brings charlie out of the rig
the kid is shaking traumatized
he begins to cry
fran gets the idea
she hurries over
mackelway and zero wrestle surrounded and obscured by all of that wheat
zero is a monster and hes got that tire iron
mackelway has a busted wrist
hardly a fair fight
but mackelway is battling kicking clawing getting in as many shots as he can
his shirt rips away from his body exposing that brand mark
they roll back and forth
calmly firmly up
they turn to find oryan
who stands here mackelways gun in hand
mackelways relief is total
he pushes zero away rising
zero pulls himself off the ground chagrinned
re mackelway glad youre here man
guy was about to kill me
oryan without ceremony puts a bullet through zeros left palm
that got mackelways attention
zero howls with pain his palm gushing
the tire iron falls to the ground
mackelway approaches oryan
ill take it from here
he extends his good hand to oryan the gun
are you going to shoot him
give me the gun oryan
hey i just surrendered
oryan wheels around aiming the gun right at zeros face
that shuts the guy up in a hurry
from that service road now we hear a line of sirens approaching from a distance
unit after unit
quietly now look at him mack
hes not human anymore
go dig up that old ladys backyard youll find bodies there
maybe hundreds of them
of course ya gotta get a warrant first chain of custodys gotta be followed
one breach and he walks
no reply my way hes eliminated the world is rid of him
its a lot closer to justice than having some prosecutor tell you youve left a tissue sample in the wrong lab
that stung give me the fucking gun
oryan turns studies him
and hands him the gun
just like that
mackelway eyes it
oryan doesnt say a word just crosses back to zero and grabs that tire iron off the ground
oryans now standing right behind zero as at mackelway you have to understand none of this was arbitrary
we were chosen you and i
oryan just swung that tire iron into zeros rib cage
we hear bones crack and air rushing from the guys lungs
he drops to his knees gasping
i saw us here
you did too
another violent swing of that tire iron busting up the other side of zeros torso
now both sides of his rib cage have shattered
breathing is almost impossible
his head just began to throb
you made your point
if id made my fucking point you wouldve shot him yourself by now
another swing of that tire iron across the back of zeros neck
he crumbles face down
mackelway crosses to oryan and puts that gun right up against the back of oryans head
then an odd thing
oryan simply smiles
something about having that gun pointed right at him its a relief
just drop it
would you shoot me
thats something mackelway doesnt want to consider
put it down
calmly i want you to think for a second
about your destiny
who you are
youre cursed like i am except you keep running from it
mackelways silent you hear things
you see things
thats why you cant sleep why your head always aches
they are face to face
nothing but that gun between them
and its why you are going to let me kill this animal
and then youre going to kill me
that threw mackelway badly
oryan seizes the moment wheeling around
he takes one last swing at zero like a lumberjack
the tire iron impacts zeros skull with a dull thud cracking it
he is dead
mackelways eyes go wide
whole thing has been a blur
oryan releases the tire iron
and drops to his knees like a man awaiting execution his back to mackelway
mackelway is silent
the blood from zeros caved in skull finds its way to oryans knees
but oryan remains peaceful
i cant do that mack
ive seen all this already
for months now
every time were in this field same wind same rain
he puts a finger to his head pretending its a gun
then he pretends to pull the trigger
mackelway gets the idea
i want you to
im begging you to
mackelway doesnt know what to do
then making matters worse aloud mack
shes about a hundred yards away
but shell be here soon enough
that puts some heat under oryan im tired mack
can you hear me
shes yards out now
pull the trigger
no reply im not going to jail
now pull the fucking trigger
oryan knows it
oryan rises now facing mackelway
some things are not up to us to decide
they just exist
it has all already happened
you know that
youve seen it too
he shoves mackelway in the chest
shes yards out now
shut it off for me
im not going to kill you oryan
of course you will
ive seen it
you saw wrong
incredulous thats impossible
can you hear me
yards out now
maybe close enough to hear oryans voice
rambling unraveling you dont understand
those fucking faces
on that map
they call to me
i see their eyes in the dark theyre staring at me how did you let this happen to me
but thats the thing about them theyre like pictures
they never blink
stare and always at me
thats my destiny do you see
i didnt help them when they needed me and this is my penance
i accept it
but im opting out now ya get it
i cant stand this anymore
i wanna close my eyes for once and see something other than torture
mackelways expressionless its not a bad start mack
weve made the world a little safer now
speck fulcher starkey now zero
weve made justice
but i get some too
you have to end all this for me
thats why youre here
its your destiny
stop telling me about my fucking destiny
again but ive seen it
open your eyes oryan

youre a guy with a skill
they taught you more than they shouldve
im sorry about that
but youre not god
you cant see everything
yes i can
and you can too
thats why i chose you
mackelways not budging
oryan can see that
re tire iron fine
ill make it easy for you oryan picks up that tire iron
mackelway sees whats coming
oryan swings the tire iron as mackelway backs out of its range
put the fucking thing down oryan
oryan keeps pursuing
mackelway keeps backing up
the swing misses
wont even need a hearing this way
you apprehended the suspect in the commission of a murder
then he turned on you and you fired in self defense
oryan isnt letting up
and mackelway cant quite fire
these things are bigger than you havent you seen that yet
were just puppets
im not going to kill you
you dont get to decide that
yes i do
oryan takes one more swing as silence
so does oryan
theres fran emerging from the tall wheat gun trained right on oryan
his shock is total
oryan doesnt move at first
then slowly an ironic smile snakes its way across his lips
at mackelway surprised its funny
i never saw anyone else out here
mackelway doesnt answer
oryan eyes him
do it mack
mackelways silent please
im begging you
there it was the very thing mackelways been hearing all this time the exact words
unsettling as hell
and we begin to intercut images of this moment with images from those visions that have been hinting at this very wheatfield since page one
a intercut with ext
wheatfield fantasy same a tall wheat wet wind oryans voice im begging you
mackelway snaps himself out of the vision
that was almost an attempt to make those images stop to deny its awful inevitable conclusion
im not you
two men neither of them flinching
until oryan nods as if to say good bye
more of that vision interrupts now a gun rising
oryan rears back and swings that tire iron right at mackelways head
fran has no choice
oryan is hit right between the shoulder blades
the tire iron hits mackelway in the shoulder
oryan crumbles to the ground landing face up
a body slumping to the ground
mackelway stands over him
now real life again mackelway stands over oryan just as oryan had always envisioned it
that makes him smile even as hes dying
weak thank you
then he dies eyes open
mackelway looks to fran
hours have passed
dozens of law enforcement vehicles have arrived
zeros rig remains on its side
mackelway sits nearby on a curb his shattered wrist is in a sling
up above the clouds have parted
morning sun streaks through
no more rain
fran sits beside him
at their feet in the gutter of this service road lies a discarded milk carton covered with dust
the face under the have you seen me
is unknown to us
kathleen is nearby holding charlie tight
cops surround them
an unmarked sedan arrives
charlton hurries out of it making a bee line for mackelway
mackelway half nods where is he
where is he
mackelway rises studies charlton
theres nothing to say
so he extends a hand to fran
she takes it rising to her feet
they leave charlton behind
we pull away from them craning up taking in this expanse of tall wheat tilting up to that morning sun
an afternoon sun now blazing white hot
were some distance away
heat rises off parched earth lending a vaporous screen to everything
but we can make out the shapes of men in haz mat suits
delias backyard is being torn up by a back hoe
looks like a war zone bodies wrapped in cloth being exhumed from the ground
dozens of them
but theres plenty of soil yet to be turned
might be hundreds unearthed by the time these guys are through
