the game early draft by john brancato michael ferris the game by john brancato michael ferris october a
titles over home movies from the s flickering grainy a seven year old birthday boy with a blindfold spins round and round the hands of other children keep him spinning
its a game of pin the tail on the donkey
the dizzy boy is given a strip of felt and the camera follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey
he pins the tail on its nose
quick ragged cuts the boy blows out candles
a clown ties balloon animals
children maids and butlers hover about theres even a real live pony
the party take splace in the gardens of a massive pacific heights mansion
the boy is schuyler van orton and this is his birthday party
hes a serious looking child who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother mrs
van orton a stiff looking society matron
a nanny brings over an infant and gently places the baby in schuylers arms
schuyler is ultra careful over whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny brother david
the boy and the other children sit spellbound watching a magic show in the front garden a magician waves a colored handkerchief a dove flies out
camera follows the bird up toward the house
the camera finds mr
van orton a pinched depressive man of about wearing glasses
he stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion in a bathrobe smoking a cigarette
the unseen photographer zooms in jerkily on the man
when he realizes hes being photographed mr
van orton turns his back and goes inside the house
the film solarizes and runs into leader titles continue
early morning the same mansion ideally an ornate victorian or arts crafts
the landscaping has changed there are some modern touches such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway a black class mercedes in the drive
music down segue to a cnn news broadcast over as the camera moves in on the upper balcony where wed seen mr
van orton earlier
its now covered and glassed in
we move through the glass
track through a large master bedroom neat masculine and spartan free weights a treadmill
atop the bed a laptop computer runs stock quotes
a large screen tv plays unwatched a familiar cnn anchor well assume bernard shaw
the bang olufsen clock radio clicks on am classical music now duels with the tv report
hand annotated paperwork and stock readouts cover a night table where the ringing multi line telephone joins the cacophony
end titles as we move toward a door its open a crack from this adjacent bath we hear the sound of a shower running
in the steam filled bathroom we make out schuyler van orton now
hes handsome fit and apparently in complete control of his world
he steps out of the shower wraps a towel around himself and grabs the bathroom phone
schuyler on phone van orton
yes it is my birthday bob is that why you called
no im not carrying alan baer another inch fuck him bg lumber is history
as he speaks he continues his morning ritual hair combing q tips etc
schuyler is a man in almost constant motion
the black mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic
schuyler is on his car phone news radio low in bg maneuvering aggressively through traffic
his laptop runs in the passenger seat its cellular antenna up
schuyler on carphone ignore the rumors alan you know me of course im behind baer grace a hundred per cent
great see you at the shareholders meeting next month
he hangs up and honks at another driver displaying no emotion
track with schuyler through an elegant suite of offices
he passes a discreet sign the van orton group
schuyler is on a cell phone carrying the laptop trailed by maria his middle aged secretary
she bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention
schuyler on cellphone ive got buyers for the bg paper mill goose the lawyers final papers in three weeks
sure its sad but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself you put it to sleep
as schuyler walks hes greeted by passing underlings whom he ignores
he shuts off the phone maria hands him a couple of items follows him into his office
carol from the museum called
shes sending architects sketches of the wing
the office is large tasteful reeks of old money
a window overlooks the san francisco skyline and the bay
that business week reporter called again tell him to fuck himself
awkwardly and um somebody who identified himself as um p
schuyler freezes at this stares at her
sorry i figured it was a crank but he swore youd know who he was
he wanted to meet you for lunch i told him you had appointments all cancel
cancel the whole afternoon
but you do it
did he leave a number
he just said hed be at leos in the haight
maria hands him a slip of paper lingers awaiting explanation
thats all maria
she heads out quickly
schuyler stares at the slip then turns to look out the window lost in thought
a working class bar an alcoholic or two pinball machines
schuyler sits a table near a window checking his watch its not his kind of place
a waitress arrives in a too small uniform young multiple earrings christine according to her name tag
can i take your order
i havent seen the menu
here see ya
she hands him a menu and starts off
schuyler calls after her
an iced tea please she waves a hand yeah right without looking back
schuyler sighs and opens the menu
suddenly someone backhands the side of his skull he assumes a defensive posture
schuyler sees his laughing brother david van orton
rubs his head annoyed thanks pee pee
i never get tired of that
david slides into the seat opposite him
hes in his early s good looking but unkempt wears bright funky clothes an earring and a perpetual grin
theres an intense edgy quality to him which schuyler has some trouble readjusting to
yeah since mom died what five years
so how you been
business as usual
a little girl
congrat its not mine she married a pediatrician in sausalito
off schuylers nod too bad she was actually interesting
she stopped drinking i guess getting rid of me was the th step

schuylers unamused by the memory
david grins and pulls a small envelope out of his pocket tosses it on the table in front of him
happy birthday bro
what is this
its a bomb
schuyler shrugs opens the envelope and shakes out a business card in blue and orange consumer recreation services
the c r and s are highlighted a phone number at the bottom
schuyler picks up the card fingers it

schuyler gives him a bored blank look
david throws up his hands
they make your life fun
youve heard of it
christine the waitress has shown up with schuylers iced tea
she puts it down hastily spilling some across the table
schuyler shies away grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip into his lap
cracking gum sorry
she moves off as schuyler tries to order raising a finger just a cheesebur
howd you find this place

a sigh carefully you know david this is sweet but its an awfully busy time im in the midst of a delicate liquidation mimicking him bitterly a delicate liquidation god

david slumps in his seat wont meet schuylers eyes

david glares at him
with the impeccable timing of all waitresses christine appears chipper

she curls her lip and departs before schuyler can open his mouth
he sighs resigned to the idea of not eating
calmly i just thought youd like it

i hate surprises
david winks puts a finger to his lips not another word
close as schuyler slips the brightly colored card into his pocket
establish the moonlit exterior of an older classy building in downtown san francisco
move in on a high window one of the few lit at this hour
we hear the sound of a phone chirping over
i n t
s c h u y l e r s o f f i c e n i g h t computers run stacks of paperwork etc
phone continues to ring
find schuyler as he punches the speaker van orton
elizabeth on speaker hello schuyler
elizabeth is schuylers ex wife an earnest woman a stranger to subtlety
stay with schuyler who half smiles looks at his watch
eleven forty you almost didnt make it

elizabeth on speaker slight chuckle serious how are you sky

schuyler grimaces then mimics the tone im just fine

he quickly changes the subject

elizabeth on speaker who knows maybe itll be good for you

well thanks again for calling elizabeth take care
elizabeth on speaker you too schuyler i mean that mm good luck bye
he punches off the phone in the middle of her good bye
schuyler returns to his work as if the call hadnt taken place but a few seconds later we see his concentration is completely shattered he leans back in his squeaking
schuylers mercedes cruises on the hilly streets past impressive mansions on all sides a crescent moon overhead
classical music plays
schuyler drives looking unsettled
pov driving shot from the backset of a limousine
period cars fashions etc
music continues over
schuyler changes the radio station trying to drown out his thoughts with loud rock and roll
the electric gate slides open and schuylers benz pulls in
a limousine pulls into the ungated carriageway
the back door opens and schuyler emerges from the backseat carrying elementary schoolbooks
as he approaches the front steps he looks upward at something blinks and squints
angle up mr
van orton in his robe stands on the balcony railing looking up at the sky
he turns his gaze slowly downward
young schuyler is puzzled gives his dad a tentative wave
van orton waves back his eyes dead expression blank
young schuyler opens his mouth to call to his father instead we hear an urgent electronic beeping a microwave oven beeps that the meal is ready
schuyler opens the door takes out his upscale junk food grabs a fork
on a big screen tv a cnn newscast shows a fire out of control
move from this through the manly book lined den
the house is traditional opulent densely decorated with good pieces and it feels like a mausoleum
find schuyler peeling open the plastic food container
he sits in a leather armchair
a bottle of dom perignon sits on the coffee table near a champagne flute glass a cupcake with a candle in it
the laptop computer is running
on tv bernard shaw comes out of the story
for the residents of the crescent heights project a truly tragic day is over at last ill drink to that
schuyler raises his champagne glass to the tv his birthday done
then he toasts in the direction of a framed picture on the coffee table a wedding photo of schuyler and elizabeth
up next the latest in sports
for all of us here at cnn thank you for watching schuyler reaches for the remote control
he settles back on the sofa channel hopping
he despairs of this quickly points the remote at his own head click click
he closes his eyes
van orton stands on the edge of the balcony waving as before
he looks skyward one last time then suddenly launches himself into space in a head first dive
we hear what sounds like a scream its a car horn
the vehicle passes to reveal schuyler striding toward a postmodern building in the financial district a ramp leads to a parking garage beneath
casually dressed he glances up at the facade for a few moments then goes in
the very new dramatic structure is built around a central twelve story atrium narrowing to a skylight above
theres still some minor construction underway on the ground floor scaffolding about
schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators
schuyler looks out the glass elevator as it rises vertiginously
his pov as the atrium shrinks below him
partitioned work areas terminals clutter and disarray
office doors open off a reception area
crs employees move about hectically
schuyler enters wanders about for a moment confused
a friendly female receptionist glances up from her desk
can i help you
is this consumer recreation services
i have an appointment the names van orton
the woman flips through an appointment book with a logo crs
in bg jim feingold pays a chinese delivery guy for a bag of food
i dont seem to schuyler van orton i called last week
the woman shakes her head
feingold slows as he crosses past schuyler carrying the bag
hes a no nonsense engineer looks a bit dull but he exudes competence and trustworthiness
this gentlemen says he has an appointment but
feingold glances at schuyler shrugs
van orton huh
ill take him
shakes his hand jim feingold v
in charge of engineering and data analysis
the man leads schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor looks in a couple then finds what hes after
he snatches up a couple of pages hands them to schuyler
then he finds a clipboard on the floor tosses it to him like a frisbee
sorry about the chaos were still in the process of moving
follow me ive got an office around here someplace
he reaches into a box of pens passes one to schuyler
close on pen the crs logo
a modern dramatic office
swoopy furniture imposing art all very cool looking
feingold moves behind the desk unpacks a couple of white cartons
i cant remember the last time i ate in a restaurant all i do is work
schuyler sits on a couch looking at the forms
i know what you mean
look what is all this
the fast talking feingold moves energetically through the office occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks hes a bit hyper and fidgety in general
application mmpi and tat tests financial statement
indicating food want some
tung hoy best in chinatown
as schuyler shakes his head the tests serve a threefold purpose
first off are you right for us
are we right for you
unfortunately theres a limited number of slots lets back up here over him b we need an idea of your abilities and limitations what turns you on and off
numero tres our insurance company requires it
a beat studying schuyler youre familiar with our service arent you
not at all
what are you selling
its a game
recharges the batteries gets you off the treadmill its an experience
sort of a vacation for the guy whos been everywhere
this really doesnt sound like my sort of feingold sits on the edge of his desk arms crossed nodding and smiling condescendingly he raises a hand to stop schuyler
whats so amusing
i know who you are
youre david van ortons brother he got you in here
remembering fondly david was impressive one of the better ive seen
but frankly i can see youre not the type
you know a player
im not a player
i dont mean anything personal by it i know youre an important guy powerful guy youre used to being on top
its just this isnt for everyone
not everyone can handle it
nearly losing it what kind of fu game is this
the ultimate fucking game
i wish i could tell you more but its different every time
rising thanks for coming in doesnt move im not an idiot
i see what youre doing
first the vague yet intriguing pitch then im supposed to feel like my manhoods in question because im not up for what some motivational role playing fantasy nonsense interesting you
dont know the first thing about it but youve already decided what it is
listen i dont wanna waste any more please jim cut the hard to get shit
ive got the afternoon free ill take your silly tests
feingold cocks his head reappraising him
then with a smile he calls to an attractive young woman passing in the hall schuyler meanwhile flips through the pages of the tests
nelson are you busy
we need someone to run mr
this way sir
as she leads schuyler out the door feingold winks at him
ill catch up with you after the physical
schuyler reacts a physical
he throws up a hand and follows the woman into the hall
alone now feingold cracks a fortune cookie and glances at the slip of paper inside
he furrows his brow with concern at the fortune then tosses it aside
during the following quick cuts sounds will be layered in and continue over one another e
the sound of a scraping pencil the blips of machinery heavy breathing murmuring voices of technicians giving instructions
x close a pencil fills in box after box on a long mmpi form
close on a couple of these i sometimes hurt animals
i feel guilty when i masturbate
each followed by true and false boxes
a white walled room schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by a stone faced psychologist a tat test he laughs as he speaks into a tape recorder analyzing the pictures
x close the drawing a large ant with an apron feeding a tv dinner to a human child
the card moves just as we register it to reveal another drawing of a smiling man toppling backwards in a chair perched on the edge of a cliff
a lab electronic monitors and printers record schuylers eeg and ekg
we see him on a doctors table wearing a medical gown with the crs logo
hes hooked up to the wires a female technician studying the readouts while a nurse takes his blood pressure
x close the traveling trace of intersecting colored waves
a darkened room schuyler in fg still in the gown watches a screen as images flash geometric shapes words photos
his finger hovers over a bank of three buttons he presses different ones from time to time
theres a mirror to one side of the room g
x close a computer screen shows green columns of numbers schuylers name is steady at the top of the screen with an account number
camera moves from the screen to show an unseen computer operator watching schuyler through the one way glass
the cacophony of the montage ends abruptly as we cut to schuyler in the gown sits on an examination table with his hands in his lap in a small featureless
cubicle he seems vulnerable looks around blankly
to himself irritated and bemused david you suck
feingold bursts in a slew of computer print outs under his arm
sorry to keep you waiting a clients head exploded
grins you can get dressed were done
he throws open a closet door
schuyler reaches inside for his clothes which are neatly folded and on hangers
feingold turns his back on him as he dresses perching on the examination table and studying the unburst print outs
looks promising at this point
you test well youre in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket
hm some resistance to the psych questions but we got the general idea
he heads out beckons for schuyler to follow
feingold leads him through the office secretaries and other workers pack up at the end of the day
we design the game around your schedule youre free to give it as much or as little time as you wish
and of course you can call it quits at any point
this was actually a gift
did my brother pay in advance
youd have to ask our billing department
the price varies
but our service comes with a guarantee
if youre not satisfied theres no charge
and weve never had an unsatisfied customer
you mean dissatisfied
looking at a form mm thats right youre a left brain word fetishist
i get that all the time
feingold smiles tightly and leads schuyler back into his office
close on paperwork as its dropped on the desktop
schuyler crs pen in hand looks at this dubiously
so im supposed to sign up for a game when i dont know the rules i dont know the object i dont know how much it costs
its a leap of faith
but at this stage theres no commitment we just need to process your application
and if you qualify youre in for the ride of your life
what have you got to lose
schuyler clicks the ballpoint pen they both lean over the papers
initials initials sign here
schuylers about to sign when feingold grabs his wrist
a wink just kidding
close as schuyler signs on the dotted line
feingold snatches up the forms suddenly seems in a hurry for schuyler to go
very good mr
please keep the pen
schuyler shrugs sticks it in his breast pocket starts out
when can i expect to hear well be in touch
feingold gently shuts the door on schuylers face
wham a ball slams against a wall
through a window we see schuyler playing violently pumping sweat
we hear the sound of a phone call over david where the hell are you we were supposed to meet at the club oh shit sorry sky i spaced next
ill be in seattle
buy you lunch soon as you get back i swear
fed up with playing alone schuyler lets the ball bounce exits the court and heads for a locker room down the hall
i checked out crs by the way hey great you gonna go for it
havent decided yet
schuyler in casual clothes hair still wet from a shower comes out of a locker room area toward an outdoor bar by a swimming pool at this upscale country ciub
he passes pete and john two middle aged rich men sitting at a table near the bar he overhears a snippet of their conversation like fuckin wildfire just opened an
office in frisco here i played my game in new york
what do you think john will crs ever go public
laughs not likely would you
schuyler slows down eavesdropping then moves toward the bar addresses the bartender with a nod toward john and pete
i believe so
this rounds on me
schuyler moves casually toward the men n
same location later the bartender brings another round of drinks to the table schuyler and the men have been chatting a while all seem relaxed
pete the friendlier drunker of the two puffs a cigar as he speaks last time i played pebble i swore id never pick up a club again
the others chuckle knowingly
schuyler sips his drink blinking and coughing discretely at the smoke theres a slight pause
great thing about golf the way it takes you out of your life
speaking of games i take it you two are familiar with crs
time to piss
he slides off his stool
pete studies schuyler sizing him up
why do you ask schuyler
i couldnt help overhearing we dont usually talk about it
i only bring it up because well i recently tested for it
i just wasnt sure if theyre for real whether its worth it worth it
gee i dunno
they did save my fucking life
look i dont know you you dont know me but
i hit a certain point nothing meant anything
my work the wife and kids hell with em i was sick of it all yknow
they changed everything
are they for real
who cares maybe nothing is
raises his glass to reality
schuyler raises his glass numbed by this outpouring
pete drains his drink chuckling to himself
his friend comes back looking concerned takes the mans arm
winks at schuyler good luck pal
youll need it
schuyler stares after the two men dubiously as they move off
a slick designery conference room filled with babbling lawyers at the head of the table stands bob plympton a trustworthy man in his late s
murmuring continues during plymptons address
postponing the baer grace meeting is out of the question
schuyler gets on a plane for washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract every side agreement the complete closing package
schuyler has been going through paperwork in the back of the room he steps forward during the above
but theres simply no thwap
schuyler drops the stack of papers on the table silence
no is not an option
if you fail to recognize that ill find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that can get the job done chirp
schuylers cell phone has started ringing during the above
he finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner
quiet commotion resumes in bg during the following
on the other end of the line theres the bland bureaucratic voice of cynthia cynthia filter mr
yes who is this
cynthia filter this is cynthia at crs
how did you get this number
cynthia filter im just calling to inform you that weve finished processing your application im in a meeting cynthia filter and im afraid you didnt qualify
so i dont have time for beat then quickly excuse me what was that
cynthia filter well
your application was rejected
cynthia filter oh im afraid i dont have that information but many applicants dont meet the criteria
we apologize we hope it hasnt caused you any inconvenience this is absurd cynthia filter thank you for thinking of crs
click and a dial tone
schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in his pocket his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand
plympton a wel meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward schuyler steps close to him and speaks quietly concerned bad news sky
loudly to boardroom so were there any more questions or may i assume its under control
schuyler pulls up in his mbz the electric gate glides shut
he gets out of the car and sets the alarm
he heads for the front steps of his home then freezes blinks on his doorstep lies a body face down apparently a wino in a tattered filthy overcoat
same angle quick shot of the body of mr
van orton sprawled across the steps in much the same position as the wino flat on his stomach head twisted at a grotesque angle
his bathrobe is even similar in color to the winos overcoac
schuyler shakes off the memory looking alarmed
he calls out hello
what are you doing here
the body doesnt stir
he approaches gingerly
he crouches by the wino winces at a strong smell covers his nose
he reaches out to touch the body but hesitates pulls back
alive or dead he doesnt want to have anything to do with this person
shit shit shit
the wino suddenly springs up like a jack in the box bending backwards impossibly at the hips
schuyler lets out a cry and scrambles back toward his car
the head swivels to face him its a grotesque harlequin its head made of colored glass lit from within
the mouth drops open and a tongue in the shape of a corkscrew springs out
a small key on a hook dangles from the tip of the tongue
one of the harlequins glass eyes winks
schuyler stares in amazement for a few moments
close on the dangling key as schuyler fingers it
the key catches the light and we see the letters crs embossed on it
the dummy is dumped in a straight back chair in the foyer
schuyler takes a step back and studies it
he crosses its legs smirks and shakes his head ascending the stairs
close on the disturbing empty stare of the dummy
close on schuylers eye as he blinks and removes a contact lens
a newscast is barely audible in bg
wider schuyler squinting in a bathrobe enters from the bathroom off the bedroom putting his contact lens case into a toiletries case
hes been packing a leather garment bag which hangs from a door slips the toiletries into a side pouch
the tv plays in bg bernard shaw delivering the news
bernard shaw on tv the bill goes before the house next week where its expected to meet stiff opposition beat touches his ear wait this just in
this gets schuylers attention he squints toward the television
bernard shaw cont
on tv the u
geological service has detected a massive disturbance in the earths crust deep beneath the northern segment of the san andreas fault
schuyler scrambles for his glasses as shaw struggles to continue
bernard shaw cont
on tv they have issued a warning that a major earthquake of magnitude eight or greater is likely to hit the san francisco bay area within
a beat oh my god the next fifteen minutes schuyler sits on the bed breathes hard stares at the tube
bernard shaw cont
on tv there is no time for an evacuation
the federal government has issued the following instructions for all residents of central and northern california
schuyler is freaking out paces frantically moves toward a phone whos he going to call
he makes a low moan
shaws voice cracks he speaks very rapidly
bernard shaw cont
on tv locate emergency shut offs for all power and gas schuyler starts moving out of the room bernard shaw cont
on tv wait theres no time for that just stay away from windows and doors schuyler doubles back avoiding a window his panic mounting bernard shaw cant
on tv find a heavy piece of furniture such as a desk or table and get under it schuyler looks around sees no such appropriate spot in the room
bernard shaw cant
on tv if no such furniture is immediately available go to a window or doorway schuyler blinks hesitates starts to move toward the doar bernard shaw cant
on tv but first turn off all power and gas
crouch in a comfortable position put your head between your knees and cover it with your arms schuyler confused crouches as instructed bernard shaw cant
on tv then kiss your lily white ass goodbye
on this last line shaws voice starts to echo and change
schuyler rises staring at the tv mouth agape
his voice is utterly transformed
bernard shaw on tv howdy sky
his face ripples and morphs into a skull its becoming clear that this is a computer generated bernard shaw
cybershaw on tv que pasa
as cybershaw speaks his face will continue to transform sometimes back to a recognizable human state other times into abstract images a talking piano a dog etc
cybershaw on tv welcome to the game
congratulations on your decision to let consumer recreation services entertain you
the combination of relief amazement and anger is a bit much for schuyler to absorb
smiling sickly fuckers
cybershaw on tv this might be a good time to lay out a few ground rules help you enjoy your adventure
youve received the first key
there will be others
pay attention you never know where youll find em you never know when youll need em so keep em with you at all times
as he speaks schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside table
he starts putting it onto his keychain
on tv screen below cybershaw a phone number scrolls past
cybershaw on tv you might want to write this number down its the crs hotline operators are standing by to assist
but please dont call to ask what the object of the game is figuring that out is the object of the game
schuyler has snatched up the crs pen to write down the number it doesnt work
swearing he tosses it aside grabs another
on tv cybershaw morphs back into the original bernard shaw
theres a quick visual glitch on the tube as the original tv feed resumes bernard shaw is delivering a normal news story
bernard shaw on tv reaction on wall street was muted following the feds announcement of
schuyler is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics in spite of himself
he hits the speaker button on his phone dials
operator voice filter youve reached crs
yeah this is pretty impressive but listen operator voice filter our office is closed
please call back during business hours
my name is schuyler van orton my game just started
look this is a bad time im about to leave town a dial tone crs doesnt take messages
schuyler sighs hangs up
schuyler crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of the house
he fingers a box with a miniature loop and rabbit ear antenna thats been spliced into the line with a tiny s shaped wire
he starts to unscrew it then thinks twice heads back in
wider as schuyler enters his mansion a gibbous moon overhead
mist in the air a jet taxis to a terminal
schuyler comes out of the gate with the garment bag and a briefcase
he joins up with a driver carrying a sign that says van orton the man takes his bag for him
im expecting a package with some documents
did it arrive
the man shakes his head schuyler exasperated whips out his cell phone and dials
as he and the driver move through the crowd they pass a red eyed dredlocked homeless looking rasta man in a brightly colored outfit with knit cap hassling other travelers
he turns his attention to schuyler and begins walking alongside
ay mon got sometin fo you mon
to the rasta get lost pal
no can do
schuyler on phone bob its sky what the hell is going on
no the papers arent here youll have to fax signature copies straight to the bg offices now
yeah ill hold
the driver and schuyler climb into a little white people mover cart the driver starts forward beeping at folks in the way
the rasta man continues to badger schuyler
you want what i got mon
hand over the phone no thank you
dere are many paths to enlightenment but you must choose one and stay on it or you will surely die in the darkness ill take my chances
the rasta man jogs alongside holds up a stained newsprint religious tract schuyler glances at it without taking it close we see the words crisis revelation solution
the letters c rand s are printed in a different color from the rest
wider schuyler ignores the tract hes talking to bob again on the phone
the driver speeds up as they pass a guard entering a restricted access area
schuyler on phone what
fire their asses thats it
the rasta man runs out of breath as the cart speeds up
he calls after schuyler jah love mon dats the key dats the key
cold and bleak
the little white truck emerges from the terminal crosses the tarmac heading toward an idling helicopter where is stops
from the chopper alan baer emerges hes an elderly muscular man bluff once blue collar
he gives schuyler a firm handshake
they have to shout over the whirring blades alan
whats wrong with a car im giving you an overview of our little operation
you gotta see the new breed of high yield saplings
schuyler looks uncomfortable with this prospect
the driver is already loading his bag into the chopper
baer claps a hand on schuylers shoulder leading him under the wash into the chopper
the rasta man is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby
he watches the helicopter ascend with a half smile
schuyler and baer in the back of the chopper
how was your flight
schuyler looks out the window
schuylers pov on the pasta man in his colorful clothes now holding up a dangling key on a chain
moments later hes invisible in the mist
on schuyler looking disappointed and annoyed with himself he realizes hes missed something
he reaches into his pocket as baer drones on beside him
schuyler pulls out his keys fingers the gold one with the crs logo thinking
the helicopter swoops low over a beautiful forested mountainside
pan from a window
outside we see a sign baer grace lumber and the helicopter now idle on a pad
move past a humming fax machine find schuyler addressing alan baer across a table
a couple of other lumber execs are present
everyone wears a stricken expression schuylers tone is matter of fact
youve been planning this for months havent you
sandbagging me like this selling us for scrap
bg lumber is not profitable and hasnt been for years my duty is to salvage what i can
these are the closing papers in ten minutes im going to present the sale terms to the shareholders and elect my new management team
as he speaks schuyler moves to the fax machine
a transmission has come through he picks up the sheaf of papers
i was friends with your father you bastard i watched you grow up and now you kick me in the balls schuyler squints at the papers in his hand flipping
close the entire transmission has been garbled
the words all bleed together incomprehensibly it looks like a childs scribbles
thats not how you play the game
schuyler turns on him a suspicion forming
you couldve fucking told me
schuyler studies the senseless pages for a moment then puts them down shaking off his apprehensions
well just have to go with the earlier draft
in bg one exec picks up a page whispers to an assistant who moves out of the room
schuyler moves to his briefcase
he starts patting his pockets
cant find your keys
baer has a malevolent expression
schuyler looks at him
where are they
up your ass
a couple of execs stifle chuckles
schuylers suspicions mount
up my ass very funny
his eyes drift to a piece of corporate stationary on the table in front of him
he picks it up insert under baer grace letterhead we see a handscrawled note crs called
we dont see whats written below
schuyler is reeling paranoia confirmed
i dont ok
ok youre with crs
baer stares at him blankly
schuyler puts a hand over his eyes seems disoriented trying to piece it all together
so the game its just a screen to blow this deal
im not following you
like hell you arent
how did you get my brother involved thats unforgivable
the assembled execs are looking at schuyler in utter confusion
as he speaks the assistant returns with some paperwork
schuyler stares at him menacingly
sorry to interrupt
weve been having some trouble with this fax so they re sent the material
its all ok now
the assistant comes over cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of schuyler
the assistant fishes in his pocket
oh and mr
van orton are these yours
the pilot found em on the floor of the chopper
schuyler gingerly takes the keys which the assistant holds out looks from them to the paperwork
then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table insert note it actually reads cbs called
schuylers thumb or a post it note covered the base of the b before making it look like an r
it continues re interview with alan b
schuyler takes a breath reassembles his composure and consults his watch
he rises anxious to put the last few minutes behind him
everything seems to be in order
please disregard my last comments
the shareholders meeting is about to get underway
he heads for the door
as he leaves the execs exchange looks
schuyler wanders through the terminal carrying his bags glancing periodically at the departures monitor and the clock
his manner now has changed he eyes every passerby especially the odd ones
voice filter flight to san francisco is now boarding at gate
suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk schuyler trips and goes sprawling
the rasta man steps out now wearing sunglasses with pink lenses
shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention
schuyler gets up dusts himself off
as calmly as possible listen i quit
free at last
you wont be needin this then
he snatches up the briefcase dances back a few paces
schuyler speaks as if to a child
im quitting the game
the rasta man keeps backing away puts a hand to his ear
whas that mon
i didna hear you
schuyler is pursuing the man walking faster and faster
i said i shit
the rasta turns and runs schuyler bolts after him unable to believe this is happening
they draw a lot of looks during the brief chase through the terminal the suited businessman garment bag flapping behind him in pursuit of the crazy rasta
the mon is crazy
he runs into a mens room schuyler follows a moment later
schuyler has the rasta cornered now but he doesnt have the briefcase
both are out of breath
pissing men look wary
where is it
got something better
the rasta men holds out a shiny key on a chain
schuyler narrows his eyes hes trying not to lose control of his temper
i realize youre just some bit player but id like you to get a message to your employers
this bullshit is interfering with my work its breaking my concentration and i cant allow that to happen the rasta makes a sad face sniffles still dangling the key
if i take that stupid key will you give me back my briefcase and go away
the rasta nods with a big grin
schuyler steps forward hand extended
the rasta flings open the door of a stall beside him and hurls the key into the toilet
instinctively schuyler moves to grab it reaches into the toilet pulls out the chain his hand and sleeve dripping
the key is missing from the end of the chain
what the fuck am i doing don worry mon its a world a shit
he drops the rasta schtick speaks with an ivy league accent so try looking at it through rose colored glasses
he takes off his sunglasses folds them and tucks them in the pocket of schuylers suit
then he reaches above him and pulls down the briefcase which was perched on top of the stall
schuyler grabs it from him raises his voice i told you this is over
they all say that at first
he gives schuyler a hearty slap on the back and strolls off humming
schuyler leans against the wall shaking his head
he puts down his luggage pulls the sunglasses from his pocket
close on sunglasses theres the image of a tiny gold key embossed on each of the arms
schuyler puts them on looks around for a moment catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror he looks silly
he quickly takes them off
as schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind
the rasta has slapped a colorful sign that reads kick me on his back
the neon sign fizzles in front of this low rent establishment
bells ring and lights flash as a drunk plays a pinball machine with a lot of body english
schuyler stuck at a table right next to the machine winces at the noise checks his watch and rises
he makes his way through the lunch hour crowd to the bar leans toward the bartender a gravelly voiced woman ronnie
i was supposed to meet someone here a david van orton i was wondering if hed left a message
fraid not sorry
he drums his fingers then whips out a cellphone spins around quickly as he starts to dial and smacks into christine the waitress as she emerges from the kitchen carrying
a tray schuyler gets hit in the chest with a tray of desserts colorful jello cream pie etc
he stands there stunned and dripping
she starts picking up plates and silverware oblivious to schuylers own plight ronnie charges out from behind the bar
after the first shock schuyler chuckles with annoyance
he wipes the phone clean pocketing it
oh this is cute
what happened here you ok
it was an accident no it wasnt
ronnie gives christine a look as she starts wiping at schuyler with a rag
he picks at his chest examines the whipped cream tastes it
schuyler addresses the kneeling christine whats next a giant banana peel
christine squints up at him puzzled
oh i get it youre nuts
chrissy just apologize
dickhead here was on the phone he walked right into me
drop the act youve been waiting all day for this moment
shut the fuck up
go home youre fired
you heard me
fuck you too
she throws a plate on the ground it shatters then storms off into the kitchen
schuyler chuckles angrily pushing through the slop on the floor with his shoe looking for something
lets get this over with
wheres the next key
does she have it
ronnie stares uncomprehending
schuyler goes after christine
he crosses past a short order cook in the grimy industrial kitchen pulling a cube of jello out of his lapel pocket
he finds christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers as she finishes changing into her street clothes
her brown uniform hangs from a locker door the nameplate chris prominent
close as his fingers touch the crs of chris they even look a bit brighter than the h and the i
i wish you people could be a little more subtle
christine notices him for the first time
asshole just send me the goddamn dry cleaning bill
she waves a hand at him go away and ducks out of view finishing dressing into punk grungy street clothes
she slams the locker starts to push past him pulling on her backpack bag
dont you have something for me
uh huh sure here you go
she puts her hand into her side pocket pulls it out with her middle finger extended moving away from him in a hurry
schuylers face falls he made another mistake
wait you really work here not anymore thanks to you
shes out the swinging kitchen door
schuyler absorbs his blunder for a moment then hurries after her
schuyler catches up as christine hurries toward a muni station lighting a cigarette
a few pedestrians come off the steps from the arriving elevated train in this residential sf neighborhood
slow down you dont understand i thought it was a gag
no you dont understand
i carry mace and i know how to use it
she reaches into her purse backpack schuyler backs off
i was only trying to apologize
shit its in here somewhere fine
he starts to move away then they both hear gasping o
on the steps a heavy man in a coat and tie has collapsed struggling for breath very pale
christine and schuyler are the only pedestrians around now
shit she rushes to help the guy loosening his tie he jolts
schuyler looks up at them dubiously brushing a scrap of food still clinging to his suit
christine reaches in to clear the guys throat starting cpr
she shoots a look at schuyler
you got a fucking phone call an ambulance
schuyler approaches slowly pulling out his phone studying the guy as christine gives him mouth to mouth
this is just too weird it cant be real you really are insane
schuyler leans close to look at the man
on the mans face sweating contorted unnaturally pale his eyes rolling back as he gags his last
christine grabs the phone away from schuyler dials
we need an ambulance guys having a heart attack near the muni station at th and market to schuyler whats the number on this thing
i dont give it out off her horrified look yeah thanks she stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the mans chest returns to the mouth to mouth
schuyler looks around uncomfortably starting to believe this is a real heart attack
is there anything i can do
christine ignores him all attention on saving this guys life
wide as an ambulance pulls up siren blaring
a couple of male paramedics hurry out with a stretcher
on the steps the two paramedics lift the unconscious heavy man onto the stretcher while christine and schuyler stand aside
both have small earpieces that look like hearing aids with wires into their clothes
throughout the following theres a lot of medical business feeding the victim oxygen giving him injections etc
to schuyler could you come with us help us fill out a few forms no
i have work to do ill go
she climbs into the back they start to shut the doors
wait a minute youve got my phone he climbs in to get it back they slam the doors and start moving
the ambulance peels out
we now see the logo on the back citywide rescue systems with the c r and s in red
the paramedics are intent on the gasping man
the siren blares a bit muffled in here
schuyler looking out the back is extremely pissed makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance
chill will you
i dont want to be here
neither do i now siddown get outta their way
a bump almost sends him flying atop the stretcher
schuyler sits near christine on a ledge near the back doors
petulant id like my phone back please
an underground ramp signs reading emergency vehicles only a set of doors leading into the lobby of an emergency room medical personnel visible inside injured people etc
a few people mill outside the doors
the ambulance screeches to a stop the back doors fly open the paramedics wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance automatic doors open and close for them
schuyler and christine climb out disoriented walking more slowly to the doors
the ambulance pulls away behind them
schuyler nearly slips in a mysterious dark puddle
oh this day keeps getting better
what is your problem you think the whole fucking world revolves around you
as she says this she walks right into the electric doors which fail to open for them
their pov through the doors the gathered staff and patients all turn at once to regard christine and schuyler
they grin and wink
on schuyler and christine who barely get the chance to register this before the lights go out
pitch blackness and sudden silence
we hear only schuylers bitter laughter
dialogue over darkness as a matter of fact
what the fuck is going on
we hear rustling in a purse but still see next to nothing
its a little hard to explain
we hear the striking of a match theres some orange light christine holds the match
the whole area is deserted except for the two of them
schuyler kicks at the glass doors theyre not going to give nothing is visible beyond them
i seem to be playing a game
this is supposed to be funny i dont get it
a challenge a puzzle
ok im puzzled
where are we
schuyler has found a steel door with a glowing red sign emergency use only
he yanks it open and a pail swings down dumping water on his head
hes facing a brick wall through the door
christine cant help but laugh then yelps in pain as the match burns her fingers
schuyler flips open his phone
damn it no signal
heres a lightswitch i wouldnt she flips it on a blinding strobe flashes for a few seconds both cry out then the bulb explodes in a shower of sparks
i dont know the rules if there are any but it seems the obvious move usually backfires
i have no idea what youre talking about
theyve taken a few steps forward exploring the dark
she lights a cigarette with the next match nearly running into another door
she rattles it locked
son of a bitch
i think i have a key
schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold crs key nope
a beat thoughtful wrong key
in the matchlight we see schuyler fumbling in his pockets pulling out the rosy sunglasses from the rasta
he puts them on
too bright for you is it
schuylers pov as the last match goes out christine glows red in the matchlight for a moment then as soon as it goes out we see a glow of fluorescent
paint on the ground
a series of stripes and arrows in different colors glowing
these start parallel near where he stands then radiate in different directions
christine is but a silhouette against the colored lines
i can see now
grab my arm
christine moves away from him
stay on the path
a burst of flame erupts from the ground close enough to scare the shit out of christine who screams
schuyler hurries toward her
the flames vanish she lurches in a differrent direction christine dont move
leave me alone
she loses her footing on a slippery surface falls sliding down a gentle slope
they try to reach toward each other for purchase but its no good the slope is getting steeper
in a moment schuyler tumbles on top of christine in a four foot deep round childrens pool but it isnt full of water
theres a bit of black light here enough to make out cockroaches thousands of them a teeming roil of insects in a churning liquid
theres a buzzing noise both scream
schuyler quickly helps lift christine out
she starts to pull him upward but where are the glasses
fuck the glasses
we cant get out of here without them
he steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs about to get sick finally coming up with the glasses
he shakes them free of insects and clambers out to join christine whos gasping and brushing the bugs off of her
schuyler puts on the glasses and holds up a bug
hold onto me ill get us out of here
she grabs his arm both are now covered in muck from the bug soup
whats your favorite color
he takes off the glasses puts them on her
she looks around
her pov the rainbow of colored lines on the floor
ok this is kinda cool
schuyler slips the glasses off her puts them back on
sorry its my game
but well take blue
his pov a blue line moves in a snaking path ahead of them going in circles now and then intersecting or moving parallel to other colors up a series of
this space sometimes resembles a parking garage scmetimes a sewer or a steam tunnel
christine keeps a hand on schuyler as he follows the path
talk about the blind leading the blind
whats your name anyway
sky van orton
were your folks hippies or something
far from it
im christine kaminsky
nice to meet you
later christine almost hugs schuyler now as they move in a seemingly random pattern in the darkness
its a company called consumer recreation services crs
i never know whats gonna happen next
well who does
until recently i had a pretty good idea
the blue line has led them into a narrow tunnel soon theyre crawling on hands and knees
so are you like a serious masochist or just really really bored
im sorry you shouldnt have been dragged into this
i have to tell you something
some guy came into leos yesterday showed me your picture offered me bucks to spill that food on you
said it was a practical joke
i figured what the hell i can use the money i got him up to
i hated that fucking job anyway wait so the heart attack you knew that was a joke too no
it scared the shit out of me but that cpr routine i used to be a lifeguard
points were getting somewhere
the tunnel has opened up again
theres even a tiny bit of visible light now
he takes off the glasses gives them to her
her pov the colored lines are all joining up from different directions
a few steps onward they all converge at a point like the spokes of a wheel at a white spot on the ground
schuyler and christine look around then schuyler points upward a white ring overhead
it looks like the underside of a manhole cover with an illuminated circle of light around the rim a halo
how do we get up there
schuyler steps on the circle of white its a button
a rope ladder drops down
a manhole cover slides aside schuyler climbs out and helps christine up
its a short covered wooden walkway in an alley
well that was pointless
kind of fun
mm a different kind of fun
whats your middle name
schuyler points to some graffiti a heart with svo clk
youre supposed to be here
they picked you for a reason
they start to move shakily down the construction walkway both bedraggled covered in goo
handbills cover one wall
probably knew youd play good samaritan for that guy drag me along but they could have hired an actor for that less of a risk
on the wall a series of handbills say arent you forgetting something
schuyler puzzles over these as they move gets to one last one behind you stupid
schuyler looks back toward the end of the alley a yellow dumpster with the logo consolidated refuse supply and the smaller image of a key
schuyler moves quickly to it throws open the lid
angle in dumpster a mountain of shredded paper
schuyler rolls his eyes sorting through it
this is really sick
i think theyre trying to fix us up
maybe you cant play alone who says i want to play
a sigh ok what the fuck are you doing in the dumpster
theres something in here i need
he climbs inside dives in
and pops up again in a moment with close a z shaped window crank
sure enough theres a key embossed on the side
schuyler climbs out again brandishing the small crank
whats that for
i imagine ill find out
schuyler pockets the crank as he and christine emerge from the alley
pedestrians give them a wide berth
to a passerby what are you looking at
schuyler heads straight for the crs doors the large numbers printed above its locked
he tries his little gold key on a deadbolt its useless of course
this is their offices
we must have been in their garage
my office is just a few blocks from here we can get cleaned up there
he walks a few steps on she stands still for a moment then nods agreeably and follows
start on the skyline schuyler moves from the window as we hear a door open
christine emerges from the attached dressing area and bath toweling damp hair in an oversized harvard sweatshirt and gym shorts with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes
she looks good clearly she put some effort into her make up
moving past her find everything you need
youre outta conditioner
my apologies ill have it taken care of
help yourself to the fridge
he points to a mini fridge shuts the door a moment later we hear water running
she looks around the office letting down her facade
she seems quite impressed and intimidated by the place
she looks back toward the bathroom door maybe this guy isnt so bad after all
from this point she takes a more seductive tack
later schuyler has cleaned up is finishing dressing pulling a pair of jeans over boxer shorts tucking in a sport shirt
christine talks through the closed door
how rich are you anyway
amused rich enough
bit forward arent you
well what exactly do you do
manage investments some venture capital im on the board of a number of publicly traded companies
so you just like move money around
schuyler emerges shoes in hand
beats working huh
christine sits on his desk with her bag slung over her shoulder eating an apple
she slides off the desk flirting rather bluntly
you dont look so bad without the tie
look i hope you havent been too put out
i could probably get you another job i have a stake in a couple of restaurants im not much of a waitress really
yknow todays been kind of can you type
kind of a turn on you know
getting no response i didnt mean just the danger
like fucking in a graveyard
so where do you live
christine realizes her come on is falling flat she pulls back tossing her unfinished apple in the trash
out in concord with my folks unfortunately
theyre never gonna believe that ive been hanging out with a guy like you
what do you mean
nothing just most of the guys i see have tats yknow
off his confused look tattoos
wed better head downstairs the limos waiting
christine nods disappointedly as schuyler moves to the door
schuyler and christine ride in silence in the back seat
mind if i smoke in here
leaning forward up here on the left
as the limo pulls over he and christine turn to each other
its a somewhat awkward moment
so whats our next move
i mean in the game
obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for im not playing anymore
disappointed why not
i have a life
jackll take you home or wherever you want to go
yeah maybe ill get in a little ballroom dancing before bed the limo has stopped now
schuyler has started to open the door
wait what about your clothes
cmon its a brand new sweatshirt
so saying she pulls it off
shes wearing a black bra
a rose is tattooed on her shoulder
schuyler cant help but react
she thrusts the shirt at him hes half out of the car
no its not just back from the cleaners
throatily you dry clean your sweatshirts
he nods slightly
as he reaches to take it christine leans forward cups the back of his head and gives him a long hard kiss
jack the driver middle aged and trustworthy turns and catches a glimpse of this quickly turns away
christine breaks the kiss sinks back against the red leather seat waiting for schuyler to make the next move
schuyler nods again torn
shes looking at him expectantly
hes clearly aroused but this is such an inappropriate female
sadly he waves a hand
schuyler shuts the door sweatshirt in hand the dome light slowly dims out out on the crestfallen christine we see her mouth a curse
schuyler moves toward his mbz the limo idling
hes about to get inside when he sees a ticket in an envelope under the windshield wiper
he snorts insult to injury tosses it on the dash as he climbs in
he sits behind the wheel watching the lights of the limo disappear
he sniffs the sweatshirt a moment then starts at the sound of a motor starting across the street
angle through side window an mbz the same year model and color as schuylers pulls away from the curb schuyler gets a glimpse of something reflecting street light in the
window of the car a gun
a camera with a long lens
the car makes a quick u turn and drives in the same direction as the limo
schuyler curious starts the engine as if to pursue
then he glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye
he doesnt put the car in gear picks up the envelope instead
close on envelope the words open me are printed in block letters on the outside
he opens it quickly theres no ticket inside but he shakes out a rainbow colored condom in a clear wrapper and a note in kidnapper letters better safe than sorry
schuyler frowns at this and throws the note aside
he flips on the windshield wipers its started to drizzle and pulls out
pov through windesield a dark figure runs from the curb by leos right in front of the car schuyler slams on the brakes its david
he hurries around to the passenger door and jumps in looking haggard scared a man on the run
jesus david you scared the shit out of me im sorry sky just drive please schuyler pulls forward
where were you today
i almost didnt make it at all
i been in the bar for hours waiting for you to come back to your car jesus i cant believe i did this to you im so sorry slow down
take a breath what are you talking about
it just doesnt stop
i thought id finished playing a long time ago i paid the bill then it started all over again they wont leave me alone slowly evenly calm down
what are they doing to you
it just doesnt stop
yes its a pain in the ass but why would they keep playing once you paid them
i dont know
i paid them more to make it stop god help me i even gave you to them
but they wont leave me alone
he sees the crumpled note on the floor picks it up whats this
it was on my windshield oh shit oh shit they must be following us he cranks his neck around looking for pursuers
schuyler looks at him for a beat bang
he almost loses control of the wheel
a tire has blown
schuyler drives on the rim struggles to get over to the curb brakes hard and stops
davids losing it looking around
theyre shooting at us
david get a grip its just a flat tire
he picks up the phone punches buttons gets nothing
damn it the phones not working of course not
climbing out fine ill change the fucking thing myself
just hurry ill pop the trunk
david reaches for the glovebox
no you cant do it from close on glovebox it pops open and keys spill out
there are at least fifty of them jammed in there all kinds silver and gold
and all have crs stamped on them
schuyler leans closer intrigued
davids eyes go wide as he fingers a few of these keys
what the fuck are those whirling on him like you dont know
sonofabitch they got to you first didnt they
um david hello
david gets out of the car in a hurry amidst the greenery in the park
raining harder now
its more than that isnt it
youre part of it youre one of them
of course it makes perfect sense
they planted those keys
i dont know what the hell theyre for schuyler tries hard to be rational but david is over the edge
youre behind the whole thing arent you
you and your sick fucking friends set it up what
get a grip david why would i do that
i dont know out of boredom to get back at me for what
for being a weirdo for trying to be happy
well congratulations you win
now make it stop
grabbing him i cant
listen to me fuck you
david slugs him in the face schuyler staggers back clutches his bleeding nose
david runs full tilt into the woods near the japanese tea garden
schuyler pursues amidst the trees and vegetation running out of breath calling after david whos vanished
he leans against a tree panting dabbing at his bleeding nose with a scrap of tissue from his pocket
he hears a phone ringing moves toward it emerging through bushes near the academy of science
he pauses at the ringing payphone
he decides not to pick it up looking around at the deserted museum buildings and hurrying toward civilization
he passes other payphones en route to the park exit
each one starts ringing as he approaches it
he moves faster freaked
at the edge of the park he snatches one up schuyler on phone what have you done to my brother you bastards
this is over im not playing anymore beat hello is anyone there if youd like to make a call please hang up and dial again if you need help schuyler
slams the phone down
he dabs his nose one more time tosses the paper scrap into the trash
close on scrap crs with the emergency number the blue ink has bled with the rain and schuylers blood
pov through car windshield as schuyler emerges from the park
the car suddenly moves forward with schuyler
he walks to the curb distractedly raises a hand for a cab which pulls up instantly
he climbs in
an aged battered cab plexiglas between the cabbie and the back
six three six mission please
the cabbie nods and hits the gas
the cab roars down the street kicking up water from the gutters
schuyler bites his cuticle not watching where theyre going the windows are wet and fogged
then he looks out narrows his eyes and raps on the plexiglas partition
youre heading the wrong way
cabbie filter relax pal youll get where youre going
the cabbie turns in profile for a moment
he appears to be wearing a hearing aid a round piece of plastic a tiny wire disappearing into his shirt
and theres something familiar about his face
schuyler glances at the driver id on the back of the seat close on photo the man is the rasta from the airport with a new hairdo
the company name consolidated regency sedans
schuyler rubs his head very angry
why are you doing this cabbie rasta filter we do it all for you
were the best friends you got no one ever worked so hard to make you feel alive
but you gotta let it happen
the cab stops at a red light
schuyler tries the doorhandle it doesnt work
the cab peels out when the light turns green heads for a pier
schuyler looks around in increasing panic
what the fuck is this have a nice day
the cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the moving cab the cabbie rasta hits the ground and rolls in a perfect stunt fall
the cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and goes flying off the edge into the san francisco bay illuminated by spotlights from the end of the wharf
schuyler screams as the cab plunges and hits the water
the steaming cabs nose slowly dips below the surface
filling with water from the cars floor from overhead
eerie light from the front of the cab
schuyler tries to roll down the window the handle spins nothing happens
the cab goes under with a burble of bubbles
schuyler cranks the other window handle desperately now up to his waist in water water gushing in now
increasing blackness through the windows as he sinks
the handle falls off in his hand
the sinking cab headlights and interior lights still on schuyler inside kicking at the windows and the plexi without any success
schuyler stops his frantic kicking tries to think coolly
hes up to his neck by now
angry at himself for not realizing it sooner he pulls what he needs out of his pocket the handcrank he found in the dumpster
he takes a deep breath and
underwater he inserts the crank into the window handle hole
a perfect fit
he cranks fast water floods in
schuyler slithers out the open window
cheeks puffed out he kicks frantically for the surface
he bursts to the surface spluttering catching his breath
a flashlight beam catches him
mister are you all right
schuyler treading water turns around a cabin cruiser at the dock nearby
a very beautiful girl in a yellow rain slicker holding a powerful flashlight leans over the edge tosses him a life preserver hauls him toward her
schuyler clambers onto the rear ladder with the girls help teeth chatering
hold on the boats colorfully painted name on the stern poseidons curse and in small letters costa rey sol
schuyler boards the large ritzy craft
im very grateful
shouldnt swim in the bay you could get hepatitis
schuyler nods looking around recovering from the shock
i have to get in touch with the police
youre freezing i got some dry clothes below
schuylers wet clothes hang from a hook hes in a towel starting to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes
do you need any help
his back is turned as the girl climbs down opens her raincoat only a string bikini beneath
she could be a playboy centerfold
buttoning his pants perfectly
he turns slowly just as the girl reaches behind her
sure i cant do something for you
she winks as she lets her top drop
schuyler smiles strangely
she takes this for lust approaches him with open arms
he grabs her by the hair
menacingly i am finished playing
she pounds at him tries to kick
he wrestles her to the floor kneels on top of her
he seems about to hit her
this has got to fucking stop
youre hurting me
who are you
i just got hired to show you a good time
cmon please get off me
schuyler gets his rage under control horrified at himself
he climbs off her she scrambles away afraid covering herself
i am not into this kinda shit
who hired you
i dont know the service set it up
yknow fantasy girls
they said you had this wild fantasy i should just wait in the boat
schuyler realizes hes not going to get anything more out of her pulls on a shirt grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin
schuyler leaps off onto the wharf
the girl pulling the raincoat on leans over the deck
doncha want your thing
im supposed to give you this this key thingie
schuyler pauses turns slowly approaches
the girl nods quickly reaches over the railing to hand him a small wooden coffin with a black bow and a red key burned into the lid
they said youd figure out what to do with it
schuyler takes it from her gingerly undoes the bow opens the lid angle in coffin an ornate hatchet with a key design on the blade
schuyler removes it from its quilted resting place
the girl backs away nervous to see schuyler with a weapon
im supposed to carry a fucking hatchet around
i dont want it
he drops the axe and the coffin into the water with a splash pt
they go under and disappear
early morning the rain has stopped a rainbow arcs behind the office building
two cop cars marked and unmarked pull up at the curb lights flashing
schuyler in the clothes from the boat and plympton his lawyer are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives barnett and gallo and two uniforms
thank you for your promptness officers
im robert plympton mr
van ortons attorney lets go
schuyler enters followed by the others
he stops short reacts
wide shot reveals the same offices now entirely empty
the partitions the desks everything has been removed
a small amount of trash is scattered on the floor the move was evidently hasty
uniform speaks into his walkie talkie cop talk pokes around in a box full of shredded paper plympton confers with barnett nods then both of them cross to schuyler who
sits on the carpet back to an empty wall
barnett checks his notes
management company for the building said this floor hasnt been rented
we checked with the secretary of state and the county recorder theres no listing of a consumer research service
no sign of the boat or the girl
divers got the cabs vehicle id the company junked it a month ago
gallo whod been talking on a phone in bg approaches
the numbers you gave us are disconnected sir this was the only address the phone company had
and we found your car its in impound
im a little confused as to motive here
you said your brother sent you to these people
its not his fault hes unstable he didnt know what he was doing and they were supposed to show you a a good time
a cautioning look at barnett my guess is this feingold guys using an alias
is there anything else you can tell us about him
schuyler spots an empty chinese food carton crumpled in the corner
closer as schuyler picks up and fingers the container chinese characters on it the name tung hoy
he likes chinese food
dont worry mr
van orton well get these jokers
schuyler nods unconvinced
plympton pulls up in his lexus schuyler gets out wearily
theres clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant
yknow sky things are quiet since the closing you could take some time off
schuyler sighs and nods closes the car door and waves good bye
he climbs the steps to his front door and plympton pulls away
schuyler enters and automatically reaches for a lightswitch blue sparks leap to his fingers the switch has been ripped out leaving exposed wiring
schuyler curses and shakes his hand out
he looks around in disbelief the walls are covered in graffiti
game over is the first one we see in the foyer above the harlequin who still sits in the only upright chair
but now a glossy black and white photo is stuck in its teeth
schuyler pulls out the picture looks at it hand trembling a police photo of mr
van orton his body sprawled in a pool of blood
its stamped property sfpd in red
oh god schuyler tosses the picture aside moves into his living room more graffiti everywhere fuck the police sore loser
no future crs rules assorted obscenities
boom as schuyler moves through the living room contact explosives on the floor explode beneath his feet making him leap and dance
over the mantlepiece a note is stuck into a painting with a kitchen knife
schuyler approaches and rips this down
insert note pan down slowly x close like my father before me i kill what i love
goodbye cruel world blah blah blah
a red signature arrow is affixed by a dotted line at the bottom schuyler groans and crumples the note
he reaches for a phone he picks up the receiver its been melted into the body of the telephone
he throws it aside
he hears voices from the next room enters cautiously picking up a small sculpture as a weapon lolc new
i n t
s c h u y l e r s s t u d y d a y the television is on playing a silly looking cartoon
action heros fly through the air shooting light from their eyeballs etc
schuyler lowers his weapon moves to shut off the tube
more grafitti over the walls the books etc
stick figure drawings of a man hanging himself a broken heart a penis a naked woman etc
across the walls over the tv are the words you are not alone
schuyler presses the on off switch nothing happens
action hero on tv dont touch that dial sky
on screen the masked action hero stands proudly hands on hips before a colorful moving background
it speaks in a cheezy he man voice an animated mouth
theres a crs logo on its chest
crs man on tv boy oh boy you fucked up big time
bringing in the cops real mistake
schuyler covers his eyes leans against a chair this is too much
no no no crs man on tv oh youre always so negative
schuyler realizes this is a two way conversation as the crs man winks at him making a stiff wave
you people are insane
crs man on tv hey look whos talking to their tv set
how did you do this how did you get in here
crs man on tv simple we duped your keys the day you came in for your physical wired the whole house while you were at work
you rich people all have alarms but you never set em do you
look at least leave my brother alone hes fragile enough as it is crs man on tv dont worry about him hes just playing his own game at a more
advanced level you might say
you cant just fuck with people like this you dont know who youre dealing with
crs man on tv we know exactly who were dealing with thats the whole idea
for a guy with your test scores youre pretty slow on the uptake
what the fuck do you want from me
crs man on tv sky i just came to say good bye
too bad it didnt work out better luck next time
uh there might be a few loose ends for you to tie up but remember its not whether you win or lose that counts its how you play the game
ya big loser you
the screen implodes as schuyler smashes it with the sculpture crs man filter ouch
take it easy my hot headed friend
schuyler peers into the smoking electronics pulls out a battery pack a small video camera a loop antenna the speakers not dead
crs man filter holy smoke this was an expensive tv he bashes the equipment repeatedly on the floor with all his might
the speaker sputters out the crs mans voice at last silenced
the phone has started ringing during the above
schuyler breathless moves around the room now trying to find it
he finally tracks it down in the bottom of a garbage can covered with disgusting slime which he wipes on his shirt
schuyler on phone now what

schuyler on phone yeah whos this
manager filter im calling from the claremont hotel in berkeley

schuyler pulls his wallet spreading his credit cards on the floor
son of a bitch
start on the dummy propped in a chair schuyler seizes it smashes it against the wall the glass head shatters
late afternoon the company limo pulls up and schuyler emerges
schuyler crosses the opulent lobby to the desk
a passing bellhop gives him a nod and a smile
schuyler stares after the bellhop whom hes clearly never seen before
he proceeds to the check in desk
before he can even introduce himself the desk clerk turns to him with a tight smile mr
heres your credit card
and the maid found this under the bed
from under the desk he removes a small attache case places it gingerly in front of schuyler
that isnt mine
it has your initials on it sir
schuyler examines the case closely for the first time sees the gold monogram s
wed just as soon you took it with you in any event
and in the future you might consider choosing another hotel for your
the man trails off and moves away
ive never been here before in my life
the man ignores him now
schuyler pockets his credit card thinks a beat then grabs the briefcase
jack drives schuyler in back studying the open briefcase in his lap
he seems extremely upset fighting to maintain his wits
the woman you took home the other night where did you go
puzzled out to concord
i know what was the address
jack is a bit nervous he doesnt want to piss off the boss
beulah drive i think yeah offa oakdale
but didnt you never mind

it wasnt me jack
of course sir
it was a white house i remember
big tree in the front
with one of those you know tire swings
jack im serious

schuyler looks at the man who stares straight ahead not believing him for a second
schuyler shakes his head looks down at the open briefcase in his lap
angle in briefcase a set of handcuffs assorted bondage gear
and a few blurry polaroid photos showing a naked woman with a leather mask chained to a bed
one shot shows her shoulder clearly we see a rose tattoo
a female impound worker with paperwork leads schuyler through a maze of smashed cars etc
in bg the company limo pulls away
triple a changed your tire
bad blow out was it
schuyler shakes his head
theyve reached his mbz
we were a little curious about the mess in the back
schuyler bends down to look in the window
his pov the backseat has been slashed
a few splashes of blood not too much
schuylers harvard sweatshirt is torn and stained with blood crumpled in a corner of the seat
schuyler swallows recovers quickly
a friends dog hed been hit by a car i drove him to the vet
as the cop nods slowly golden retriever beautiful animal
handing sky a receipt he ok
too early to say
he quickly gets behind the wheel
schuylers mbz cruises past rows of similar looking lower middle class homes a pretty shabby neighborhood
he parks the benz
a white van is parked just up the street a loop and rabbit ear on the roof
pan to show the drivers side door
a cartoonish logo with the crs man holding a wrench by a tv set in front of a rainbow the words cable repair specialists
on the house move from a whitewall tire hanging on a rope from a tree to schuyler as he rings the front doorbell of a white house
at the door an older working class man in a t shirt appears christines dad mr
schuyler van orton is that a name
look im kinda busy
starts to close the door you have a daughter named christine
im afraid she might be in danger
kaminsky narrows his eyes at him as we hear daddy
who is it
schuyler very surprised peers around mr
kaminsky schuyler does a double take as christine comes down the staircase wearing a sweatshirt and shorts
she lights up when she sees him then quickly hides her excitement
kaminsky allows the relieved schuyler to enter now
well im gonna get back to that carburetor
nice meeting you
christines dad winks at his daughter as he moves back to the basement
she rolls her eyes but mouths thanks and then moves to sit beside schuyler in the modest over knick knacked living room religious pictures and statues family photos etc
i didnt think id what are you doing here
schuyler is smiling at himself now shaking his head
christine reaches across him to flip on a lamp
last night when jack dropped you off did anything happen
i thought eh you dont wanna know
come on i thought they kidnapped you tortured you what
i saw pictures girl with a tattoo on her shoulder like yours touches her shoulder ssh my folks dont know about that yet
so what they wanted ransom from you or something
no i thought they were trying to frame me they planted evidence
why would they do that
i have no idea nothing they do makes any sense
forget it its just a game
so thats the only reason you came out here to east hell your stupid goddamn game
i was worried about you
i wanted to see you again
thinks for a beat if you pretend to mean that ill pretend to believe it
well looks like your pals are trying to keep us together
buy me dinner at least
sure why not
rises i look like a slob let me change
she hurries upstairs
schuyler sighs wondering what the hell hes doing here
he glances at a virgin mary statue squints then unscrews the head its a decanter
he takes a sniff and puts it back with a bemused expression
he takes another sniff noticing something else in the air
a wisp of smoke rises from the lamp christine turned on
schuyler peers beneath the shade
on the table is a framed photograph of a little girl who could be christine in a frilly white dress holding flowers
angle inside lampshade a new pricetag dangles from the shade against the bulb starting to turn brown smoking
schuyler licks his fingertips reaches inside the shade to pull off tag in doing so he burns his fingers on the hot bulb stifles a curse and jerks his hand
he knocks over the picture which falls to the floor
shaking his hand he rises distractedly pokes his head through a swinging door
dimly lit from outside
modest surface clutter hanging pots etc
schuyler moves to a sink turns on the tap and runs water over his burned fingertips
he shuts off the tap looks around for a towel shaking his hand the paper towel dispenser has no roll on it
he pulls open a kitchen drawer angle in drawer completely empty
schuyler curious now opens a cabinet absently drying his hand on his shirt also empty
he tries another couple of drawers finds nothing but scraps of paper matches
he exits a disturbing thought forming
schuyler picks up the photo to replace it on the table
angle on photo schuyler slips the picture from its cardboard mount its an advertisement clipped from a glossy magazine text printed on the portion previously unseen
schuyler quickly returns the clipping to its mount puts the photo back on the table as christine comes downstairs dressed and made up for a night on the town
can you get us into chez panisse
i always wanted to eat there schuyler nods casually toward the photo as she sits beside him
is that you
quick glance mm hmm first communion
touches his hair whats the matter you look a little green around the gills he grabs her hand away
icily dont touch me
his tone alarms her he stares at her with hatred
a silent beat between them each tries to assess the new situation
she realizes hes onto her
she swallows makes a quick decision
suddenly she leans close to him reaching around him to shut off the table lamp
she leaves her arms around him and hisses in his ear she drops her lower class accent speaks in a clipped educated voice dont be stupid
dont say anything not here theyre watching
sickened to himself god damn it
she kisses him he doesnt open his mouth neither shuts their eyes
then she gets up quickly moves to a corner of the room
back in character accented ok i know a good place we could go and like be alone
she glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling on ceiling a large smoke detector with a red light a cable from it theres a small lens in the
a hidden camera
schuyler looks at this starting to rise
she moves to a window out of range of the camera beckons him over
its a beautiful night isnt it
schuyler comes up beside her she nods for him to look outside pov through window the crs van
christine whispers urgently theres four of them in the van theyre armed
just play along ill get us out of here schuyler turns to her his voice is tired
to surveillance camera ok thats it game over close on a video monitor schuyler framed in a fisheye shot you can come out now assholes he moves toward the front
door a panicked christine behind him were blown lets do it we hear men getting to their feet see bodies move in fg
christines furious and terrified dashes in front of him locks and throws a chain across the front door
she starts to pull him away from the door he throws off her arm
no enough already
ive had it
he goes to the window and opens the curtain
through window the hack cabbie the rasta pilot and a pair of crs agents john and peter from the mens club hurry toward the house the older men reach inside
their jackets now what
get away from there
steps toward her oh now i suppose theyre going to the windows blow in gunfire christine tackles him and pulls him to the ground as knick knacks fly to pieces
directly behind where he was standing
christine and schuyler keep low as they dash for the kitchen holy shit
christine pulls him toward a basement door they dash down steps to the darkened one car garage mostly empty with a few random tools
kaminsky looks up from a game of solitaire a day player confused by the sudden commotion
what is this
god wake up its a con game
the garage door opens christine pulls schuyler against a wall a paramedic charges out of the shadows pulling a handgun in bg mr
kaminsky dives for cover with a frightened noise christine grabs a wrench and clubs the paramedic who falls with a cry clutching his skull
they hear footsteps on the stairs they just came down
christine hustles the dazed schuyler out of there
christine and schuyler dash for the benz climb in and screech off
crs men run for their van to pursue
schuyler drives for all hes worth christine watching behind
a brief chase the van pursues the mbz
christine turns forward her eyes widen watch out
the mbz sideswipes a car as schuyler runs a light his windshield cracks the side of the cars crunched in but he keeps driving
he crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming truck the van hits the brakes to avoid getting squashed
schuyler skids into a narrow alley
the van having lost a half a block misses this and continues straight
christines looking behind as schuyler drives
ok we lost em shes thrown forward as schuyler slams on the brakes reaches across her and throws open the passenger door which creaks from the collision
he gives her a shove she clings to the doorframe what are you doing
get out of my car
i coulda handed you to them
they find me now im dead schuyler pushes harder
christine tumbles into the wet gutter
listen to me you bastard i know whats going on
no one else is gonna tell you
schuyler pulls the door shut the car starts backing away
christine gets to her feet looks after him
he reaches the end of the alley and stops then screeches forward
she jumps to the edge of the alley fearing hes trying to run her down
schuyler hits the brakes a few feet away
he leans across calls to her
you can talk while i drive to the police station
christine puts a hand on the wheel before he can back up again
no cops i got an outstanding warrant
off his look mail fraud
ill get nailed but youll never be able to prove a thing
the mbz speeds out of a tunnel on the highway toward sf
christine looks out the side window lights a cigarette
heard about this big swindle and i needed the money
you wouldnt know what thats like
spare me the snide comments
and please dont do that in here second hand smoke is the least of your problems
blows it in his face shit they really screwed up i cant believe they didnt take the time to get the house right
wait how did before the game you were working in that bar they planted me in advance your brother set you up
oh god davids in on it
its not his fault he thought it was the only way out
just another victim
how the hell did they think they were gonna get my money
honey they already got it
she gives him a pitying look
schuyler throws her a sidelong glance this is absurd
she gestures at his car phone
you dont believe me check your bank accounts
listen that night in your office remember
i downloaded files off your computer while you were in the shower
camera moves in on schuylers face during the following and
schuylers desktop computer as christines hand inserts a floppy disk and starts hitting keys
i stuck in a code breaking program to glve crs remote access to van orton group files
rapid inserts from the crs offices schuylers signature financial forms a tape recorder test forms etc
youd already given them everything else they needed
your handwriting voice samples personal information all the tests you took
they used the data to generate your passwords
on a crt screen as various combinations of letters and numbers scroll by too quickly for the eye to read
from there they just had to break into the financial networks transfer your holdings into some dummy accounts pan over banks of computer terminals in dark offices as financial readouts
flip and change vanish
high numbers go to
remember jim feingold guy who signed you up
hes one of the original hackers did a five year stretch for zapping citibank
move from deft fingers at a computer keyboard upward toward the screen
polarize to show in reflection
feingolds face lit by the blue green crt light a mask of evil
hes not some dweeb flunkie he runs the whole show
lights through the fragmented windshield cast weird patterns on it
hes pumping sweat now reaches for his cell phone dials hand shaking
christine flicks her cig out the window she sounds regretful
they already did your brother i guess they figured you for a family of suckers
schuyler on phone overseas operator

schuyler on phone blue two five
yes i consent to voice print
my name is schuyler van orton
id like to know my balance please
that account is closed
christine nervously i think maybe you should pull over
schuyler sets his jaw drops the phone and turns the wheel hard
the mbz screeches for an offramp
schuylers on his portable phone at a gas station convenience store leaning on the benz as he pumps gas
christine stands out of earshot arms folded staring at the dark horizon
schuyler on phone bob listen carefully this is an emergency
feingold and his people ive called all my banks theyve drained the accounts personal and corporate everything tell the cops ive got one of them with me well make her
theyre trying to kill us im heading for the island in oregon if i can still find it
bob call when you get this message and be extremely careful
start on a thermos full of coffee foodstuffs miscellaneous camping supplies as a clerk holds a credit card hangs up a phone
he looks up at schuyler and christine
they say i gotta confiscate your card
schuyler sighs of course christine fishes in her pocket
i think i have some cash
they emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags christine sucks an ice cream pop
they toss the bags in the trunk
money isnt everything right
schuyler is seething clutching the trunk lid for a beat then slams it hard when she steps back making her jump
it might be best if you didnt speak
i very nearly crushed your skull just now
cmon chill whatd they take you for a couple hundred gs
chump change for a guy like you chalk it up to experience
quietly restraining himself just under a billion dollars
nervous laugh youre kidding right
do i look like im kidding
this is about more than my personal lifestyle your pals raided pension plans charitable foundations company payrolls
oh my god i dont know what kind of jerk off con games youve played in the past but now youre in the big leagues hon
you just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy and destroy a whole lotta lives
he stares at her she looks sick and truly scared
he climbs in the car
for once without a comeback she gets in the car quietly
the benz zips around a logging truck on a dirt road
schuyler bleary eyed drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it aside
he glances over at the sleeping christine her head tilted toward his shoulder she looks pretty sexy
he stares at her for a moment sighs and turns away
a beautiful northern lake dense forests on the mainland pines and fall foliage
a storm coming in ominous clouds
the benz is parked at the shoreline
move to find schuyler and christine as they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly humble somewhat decrepit cabin on it
a flash of lightning
christine pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood burning stove in which a fire crackles
this cabin is genuinely rustic and run down hewn wood fishing rods cobwebs rain damage dust
water drips from the ceiling in a few places
lightning flashes in bg through the scene the storm has gotten pretty bad
schuyler finishes taking out his contacts dropping them in cups full of water
he slips on his glasses then looks at a few framed family photos on the coffee table in front of him
christine barefoot brings him a cup of coffee which he sips gratefully
youre not having any
never drink it
makes my tits hurt
schuyler gives her a sidelong glance looks back at a photo
on photo he rubs away the dust from a shot showing schuylers father with young schuyler on a boat with fishing equipment
christine takes a step and cries out clutching her foot and sitting beside schuyler
a small fishhook protrudes from her foot hold still
he talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot
sorry this place hasnt been cleaned in a while
my dad built it himself spent a lot of time here alone
regards a leak rotten carpenter
he pulls out the hook puts it aside she rubs her foot
schuyler suddenly starts laughing wipes tears from his eyes
whats so funny
just private joke
i always told myself i wasnt gonna end up like him
and now here i am running his corporation living in his house hiding in the cabin where he went to hide right before he
i even look like the bastard
christine looks at the photo of mr
van orton then at schuyler
not that much
mm plus im a helluva lot more gullible than he ever was
the cell phone chirps schuyler shakes off his self pity snatches up the handset
christine mouths who is it
plympton filter careful worried its me schuyler
i got your message
ill admlt i was very disturbed
hand over phone my lawyer
to plympton so
whats our next move
during the following christines eyes go wide she shakes her head frantically draws a finger across her throat plympton filter ive been on the phone all morning
your funds are intact nothings changed theres been no activity whatsoever
schuyler struggles to absorb the import of this as well as christines behavior
she shakes her head with a sigh rises to refill his coffee cup
wait thats not true plympton filter firmly it is true no one is after your money no one is trying to hurt you schuyler looks at christine with horror
she nods and whispers hes in on it
plympton filter listen to me sky
what are they paying you robert
piece of the action
plympton filter schuyler
look youve done the right thing going up there maybe its best if you just sit tight for a while forget about everything its all under control schuyler hangs up
breathing hard pacing clutching the phone
we have to get out of here
christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee which he sips
the phone chirps again schuyler throws it violently against the wall its silenced
he gulps more coffee rising again looking at the smashed phone sickened by his own loss of control
well that was stupid
christine watches him closely
he keeps balling his hands into fists as he paces trying to think out his next play
ok theyve gotten to him
is there anyone i can trust
i wouldnt worry about it
a beat what do you mean
its out of your hands
he takes a step stumbles shakes his head to clear it
she rises picks up his half empty cup and heads for the kitchen area
his gaze follows this he realizes hes been drugged
thats not my name
with a cry of rage he lunges after her but crashes into the wall clutching at a hanging rod which falls when he does he knocks over the table of
photos as he goes down panting for air like a fish out of water clutching his stomach nauseated
his pov sideways low angle
sfx blood pounding in his head
schuylers eyes follow the grooves of the wet warped hardwood floor they lead to and almost seem to point to christine
another angle close from the counter she picks up a small vial with a bit of powder at the bottom slips it into her pocket
schuylers eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the effects tries to get to his hands and knees
he gasps why
christine approaches stands a few feet away lights a cigarette we needed you to call your banks
cellular calls can be intercepted rerouted yknow
she crouches by him flicking ashes a few inches from his nose
all those calls to switzerland and chase manhattan you were talking to our people
see we were still missing a lotta pieces access codes passwords stuff even plyrnpton didnt have but now we have i everything
i guess you are pretty fucking stupid but thanks
he claws at her helplessly with a groan but misses
his glasses fall off he collapses again
schuylers pov everything a blur now except in extreme fg the photo of himself and his father which now lies on the floor
flash cut to flashback pov the moment of impact as mr
van ortons face smashes into the ground his glasses shattering blood spraying from his head
cut back to schuyler writhes fighting the drug
flash cut to the moment of his fathers jump only in this hallucination schuyler himself wears the robe leaps into space
schuylers pov from floor christine moves into focus crouches near him studying her victim almost clinically
just let go
the sfx pounding stops and breathing
then screaming pounding and kicking
a wooden lid splinters as schuyler pounds his way out of a coffin
dim light through cracks in the walls this is an old and moldering mausoleum other coffins nearby
fresh flowers surround his resting place otherwise everything is completely decayed
by the time schuyler gets out of the coffin his arms are bloodied
hes been dressed in an all white burial suit
a red rose is taped to his chest
he blinks and stares about wildly his pov blurry cant make out much
schuyler blinks breathing hard utterly freaked
he notices the rose on his chest tears it off sniffs it then throws it aside with a frustrated cry
he stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt tugs then realizes it opens the other way he gives it a push it collapses immediately
schuyler tumbles out of the crypt into the hot sunlight
hes in a ramshackle city of the dead a spanish graveyard
there are endless rows of tombs rioting tropical vegetation many flowers impossibly bright colors
it should be quite beautiful and peaceful
he walks around tentatively squinting
an old woman in black sits contemplating a grave fingering her rosary
schuyler slips a hand absently into his pocket and finds something there pulls it out schuylers pov blurry shot of a note in spanish with a key on the stationery
schuyler blinks slips the note in his pocket
tight shot on schuyler blinking disoriented jostled by a sea of hispanic people on this busy street
schuylers pov walking tenuously
the worlds a blur faces move in and out of focus
theyre dark foreign many poor people poverty scarred features
scraps of spanish
he grabs a dark man
where am i
the man replies with an exclamation in spanish pushes schuyler away camera tumbles objective shot schuylers on his knees in the middle of this third world thoroughfare utterly disoriented
street vendors sell weird looking foods squads of sqldiers march with rifles musicians play odd instruments
schuyler clutches his head as if trying to wish it all away
a cop in beige uniform suddenly prods at him with a nightstick yelling at him in spanish to move on
schuylers pov the cop looming over him a blurry menace the end of the nightstick sharp in fg as it pokes at him
another angle schuyler pleads with the man please help me im an american
this doesnt seem to help
he tries to get away from the stick but the cop pursues
he bangs into people as he tries to move quickly the stick right behind him
schuyler falls over a beggar on the ground in far worse shape than he is
the cop yells at him
schuyler covers his head holding out the note with the key which the cop finally snatches away
he studies it for a moment then barks with laughter
schuylers pov the cop reaches down to him objective angle schuyler cringes expecting a blow but the cop just pulls him to his feet
he drags him away with him speaking more gently in spanish amused
schuyler nods thankfully
high angle the throngs on this crowded street
a desk sergeant studies the note approaching schuyler whose face is now red sunburnt
he sits on a bench with a vagrant or two
where am i
off schuylers blank look tegucigalpa
annoyed it is the capital of honduras
schuyler buries his face in his hands nods
hes relieved to have found an english speaker at least
so you have become lost from from your father
my fathers dead god damn it
i have to get to the united states embassy
the sergeant cocks his head confused
indicating the note do you know what this says
an hispanic embassy worker behind a desk with a u
flag translates the note aloud in amazed unaccented english
i am an american
i am an idiot
my father is very rich
if i become lost please take me to the police
there is a reward
another angle schuyler utterly humiliated sits in a chair on the other side of the desk
is this a joke of some sort
what are you doing here
i dont know
a beat well without any identification it will take at least a week to get you a temporary visa rising a week
christ knows what they can do in a week and what the hell am i supposed to to live on
what day is it anyway
squints at his watch thinks wheres the nearest pawn shop
a middle aged latina the bodega lady counts out a stack of bills on the counter beside schuylers watch
her store displays jewelry knives musical instruments as well as mystical candles potions and bottles with dead animals in formaldehyde
this will buy you a plane ticket
on the other side of the counter schuyler sorts through a box of eyeglasses trying on different pairs
yeah well i i seem to have lost my passport
the pawn shop owner nods knowingly
theres one other customer a shabbily dressed but honest looking honduran man looking through a bin full of sports equipment
he seems to have been eavesdropping the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him in spanish clearly theyre coming to some kind of deal
meanwhile schuyler puts on a rhinestone studded pair of womans glasses looks around
huh close enough
i throw them in
indicating the man this man says he can help you
schuyler narrows his eyes at the honduran man who flashes a crooked toothed smile
a large covered stake truck rumbles by on a hilly jungle highway
in the back of the truck schuyler rides among hundreds of bags of coffee beans marked cafe producto de honduras
he wears the silly rhinestone glasses as well as cheap new clothes shorts a spanish message t shirt sneakers
he munches on a mango peeks out a hole in the tarp at the passing scenery
his pov a vista of spectacular beauty ideally jungle encrusted mayan ruins against the backdrop of the rising sun
schuylers quite taken with the view despite his troubles
the stake truck is parked at a u
border crossing in the desert
the honduran man the trucks driver shows his papers to an inspector as he walks him to the back of the idling truck
angle from inside truck as a tarp is lifted
the inspector glances inside examines a couple of coffee bags
in fg schuyler hides below a bag or two holding his breath
the tarp falls again schuyler exhales with relief in the darkness
mos schuyler has been reduced to pan handling for bus fare in front of a san antonio bus station
an older man takes pity gives him a bill he moves on to a couple who shake their heads and avoid looking at him
he hurries off at the sight of a disapproving cop
angle on bus window arizona utah scenery reflected in the glass
polarize to show schuyler through the bus window exhausted numbly taking in the glorious view
all seems quiet the house dark late at night
theres a movement in the bushes near the street schuyler emerges on the lookout for any surveillance
it seems safe
he digs out a hidden key from within a fake rock then goes to the front door gathers up newspapers and a thick stack of mail from his box
he flips through it quickly finds a postcard that interests him and shoves it in his pocket the rest of the mail he leaves in the box
he punches in his code on the alarm pad unlocks the door and enters
close on alarm pad the light goes from green to red
schuyler blinks as he enters the house the graffiti is gone the mess cleared up it actually looks cleaner than ever
quick shots jump cuts the rhythm jarring
lights low throughout schuyler wants to attract as little attention as possible
in the kitchen schuyler gobbles handfuls of dry cereal grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator
in the shower schuyler scrubs away the grime
in the bathroom he inserts a contact lens
in a desk drawer he finds a few
in the bedroom schuyler changes into jeans and a sport jacket tucking the money and the postcard into the pockets
as he turns to leave he spots something on his dresser a white envelope with a handwritten to whom it may concern
schuyler frowns at this
tears it open
reacts with fear
in the kitchen schuyler holds the handwritten note to the blue flame
he tosses the burning page into the sink
close shots on the curling burning note we make out key words i want only death
and finally the signature schuyler van orton
this suicide note is no joke
schuyler backs away from the sink
quiet determined no
im going to live
schuyler moves to a bookshelf looking for a volume finds close a large leather bound black book with no title
schuyler clutches the volume
headlights shine in the window a vehicle in the drive
schuyler moves for a back door
a car door closes we see a uniformed figure move o
revealing a police style crest the words california residential security the initials crs in the center
schuyler sneaking around the side of the house takes this in waiting for the rent a cops with flashlights and weapons to enter his house
then he hurries away book under his arm
under a street lamp on a hilly street schuyler reaches into his pocket and squints at the postcard insert postcard the message side s its safe here d
an arrow points to a printed address
schuyler flips the card over a painting of a colonial mansion down a tree lined drive
the same view of the same mansion a very beautiful peaceful spot
schuyler moves down the drive toward the entrance
he carries the thick book as he will through following scenes
a nurse leads schuyler down a door lined corridor no one in sight
this place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy sanitarium
the medication seems to be helping
unfortunately were going to have to transfer your brother to a public institution in a few days his funds are entirely exhausted unless youre prepared to take responsibility
she knocks at a door opens it a crack and lets schuyler in
a pleasant bedroom and safe no sharp objects or primary colors in sight discreet decorative bars on the window
david in pajamas sits in a chair eating bland food from a plastic lunch tray
he watches a golf match on a tiny watchman tv well hear it in bg clapping etc
he doesnt react as schuyler enters moves to his side
david turns to him half smiles food particles on his lips
schuyler sits close to david upset
what are you doing here
sorry i was just eating
im much better
david does seem in control now if a little hazy
listen i know you put them onto me but i understand were both victims of this thing
theyve stolen everything we ever had theyre trying to drive us both crazy but we wont let them
well find a way
theres gotta be a way to beat these bastards

he clutches his brothers hand
david narrows his eyes confused
in what together
oh schuyler there is no game
it was just a fantasy of mine a self aggrandizing delusion
i cant believe you took that shit seriously
clutching his hand no david please
pulling away oh man stop fucking with me
you know the game doesnt exist
it never did
it never did
schuyler stares at him for a beat no getting through
david leans forward turns up the tv volume aiming the set at schuyler
can you see
on screen a golf ball rolls on a green and plops into the cup
barnett the detective from earlier has come out to the reception area to speak with schuyler whos trying very hard to be rational
so the waitress was in on it she isnt really a waitress
and now youre brothers been institutionalized
is there a history of mental illness in your family
schuyler narrows his eyes at the question
gallo beyond a metal detector in the rear area of the station gestures to barnett who holds up a finger
moving away barnett glances at the leatherbound book which schuyler clutches very possessively
barnett purses his lips nods steps around the metal detector to chat with gallo
i just spoke with his lawyer plympton he thinks van ortons having a nervous breakdown we should probably hold onto him till his people can get down here
with schuyler as gallo and barnett glance in his direction gesture for him to approach
gallo winks casually at schuyler
schuyler wary now moves toward them through the metal detector which goes off with a whine
the alarm monitor woman approaches with a wand but schuyler steps back wide eyed
probably just your keys sir schuyler turns and moves quickly for the exit
yo schuyler wait up hes through the door
the whine of the detector continues as we the whine dissolves into the screeching of a train on an el track
lights flicker on and off in a moving train car
schuyler scribbles intently in a brand new kids school notebook open in his lap
he sits at the end of the moderately crowded train car
suddenly he looks up eyes wild starts scanning the subway car slowly sensitive to it all
by now hes definitely the sort of person youd avoid in a public place
intercut pov with his reactions as everything falls into place in his increasingly febrile mind
schuylers pov slow pan over the assortment of nighttime riders a couple of teenagers an older woman with shopping bags a drunk
camera pauses on a patch of grafitti typically unreadable scrawl but the letters could be crs
camera moves to the overhead advertisements one for hemrnorhoids a seasonal bank ad featuring the easter bunny
pause on a photo of an ecstatic california lottery winner holding up a wad of cash with the words you cant win if you dont play
a man reads the sports page game final
on the floor a candy bar wrapper with a gold key printed on it part of a contest
schuyler picks this up examines and discards it
schuyler s pov an elderly man with a clunky hearing aid is looking at schuyler with a blank expression
the man suffers from a facial twitch that causes one eye to blink rapidly
schuyler narrows his eyes at the man then looks away pointedly
he puts the notebook into a plastic bag
beneath it cradled in his lap is the mysterious black book
he opens this carefully close the book is hollow
inside is an expensive handgun
wide shot from the next train car a figure in fg is staring through the scratched fogged window at schuyler as he puts the leather book into the bag with
the train car shoots into a tunnel
schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow his eyes closed
suddenly theres a knife at his throat
end of the line man
schuyler starts the punk keeps the knife on him
hes a young glassy eyed junkie
he wears a radio earplug in one ear a wire heading down to his waist
schuyler nods starts studying the mans arms heavily tattooed with crude cabalistic symbols
are the tattoos supposed to mean something
momentarily thrown yeah they mean youre dead you dont gimme what you got
touches the punks arm ok theres the c
give me the fucking bag
cold deadly come on youre not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train it wont look like a suicide
as schuyler speaks he sits up the punk grabs the bag schuyler grabs the guys knife hand they wrestle on the floor of the car clawing at each other
the punk drops the knife it gets knocked beneath the seat both men reach for it
schuyler and the punk look up to see a transit cop pointing his weapon
the punk throws his hands up scrambles to his feet psycho pulled a knife on me
the cop has grabbed the still prone schuyler flipping him over and slapping a handcuff on him what do you think youre doing this guy attacked me
the cop has dropped his guard the punk spins and bolts into the next car squeezing through the door
the transit cop hastily cuffs schuyler to an armrest wait here he dashes into the next car after the punk
schuyler looks at the floor of the car sees the small radio and its earplug attached by a wire
the radio has a tiny loop rabbit ear antenna on it
he snatches it up then yanks at the cuff
he spots the knife under the seat grabs it starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post
from the next car he hears shouts screams a serious commotion going on he doesnt know whos winning
schuylers almost gotten free as the train slows when the door at the far end of the car opens its the punk bruised and bloody ready to kill
he lunges at schuyler just as he pries the armrest off the seat and clobbers him with it
the punk reels back
the train has stopped the doors have opened schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out onto the platform just before they shut again
schuyler locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other sliding his jacket over them moving briskly up the stairs
schuyler emerges and walks quickly checking over his shoulder blinking in the bright morning sun
he fiddles with the radio the plug to his ear
we hear static bleeping noises filtered voices
for a few moments the voices on the radio become clearer
cant let him get away with this hes outta control
the next thing you know hell push the wrong button and well all be dead schuyler listens intently leaning against a wall in the shadows breathing hard
he stares nervously at a couple of nearby street people huddled by a shopping cart they stare back
another voice on the radio talks over the first whoah whoah whoah ok the guys a moron sure but he doesnt have the balls to end the world
anyway im sicka talking politics lets get back to the business of nipple piercing you got a ring dont ya robin
we hear the hysterical giggling of robin quivers
schuyler blinks recognizing the voice of radio dj howard stern
ugh we gotta do commercials this is the howard stern show
schuyler fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas calling up random radio music commercials etc
close on a trash can schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book into it
it falls open we see the gun is gone
track down an institutional corridor a few emaciated patients in wheelchairs
they only come here to die
elizabeth schuylers ex oish fit and attractive a few months pregnant reads to a couple of sad patients in a lounge area
she trails off as she looks up astonished to see schuyler bruised frightened almost looking like he belongs here
elizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a oo zx convertible and pulls into traffic schuyler beside her babbling emotionally
im sorry i shouldnt be bothering you youre a genuinely good person your work is important its real nothing that happens to me is real anymore what has happened to
i need your help youre the only one left the only one i can trust not that i deserve your help god how could you have even married me i

sometimes i think im being punished for my sins i mean there has to be a reason
elizabeth flips the pages of schuylers notebook page after page of psychotic looking scribbling dense underlines many exclamation wider a few business people read papers pick at eggs a large
screen tv plays morning programs
schuyler stares at elizabeth awaiting reaction
she seems incapable of speech
he puts the tiny radio and earplug on the table between them
this is one of their devices i pulled it off their assassin in the subway
its how they communicate with each other
elizabeth picks the thing up studies it puts the plug to her ear
schuyler waves dismissively you dont understand takes the radio back from her and pockets it
i cant find the right channel
listen i may not make it through this if anything happens get that notebook to to the press or the fbi or something
someone you can trust i dont know assuming you can trust anyone i just want you to know im not crazy and i didnt kill myself no matter what they
say she stares at him trying to be strong but shes very freaked out
a barmaid brings their order
schuyler stares at the barmaid suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before elizabeth and gives him a bottle of water and a glass
he tests the seal
has this been opened
just like you said
he watches her as she retreats leans toward elizabeth puts his hand on top of her cup
i dont think coffee is safe
schuyler opens the bottle and drinks straight from it thirstily
elizabeth registers the clinking handcuffs on his left wrist
schuyler try and listen to me
i love you i always have i always will
and maybe this is
maybe this a point you had to reach before staring at her before what
before im just glad you came to me for help
i dont know if im strong enough to to handle this on my own but i know a lot of excellent crisis people crisis people
a cell phone rings in her purse she makes an exasperated noise and pulls it out with a one sec gesture at schuyler
he rises during her conversation a new look on his face he cant trust her either
hi hon im ok
um could i call you back
schuylers distracted by something on the tv
he lets out a strangled cry
elizabeth turns her head to see
on tv screen its jim feingold clutching his head rubbing his temples with a look of pain
cheesy music throbbing spfx
schuyler approaches the set shouting at it
you fucking bastard
how did you find me here
elizabeth gets up tries to pull him back to the booth he pushes her away not taking his eyes from the set
patrons react nervously to the deranged man
feingold on tv filter ooof my head is killing me
the tv image widens a commercial actress rubs feingolds neck
who are you actress on tv filter honey have you taken anything
feingold on tv filter sure some aspirin the actress clucks her tongue shakes her head
schuylers starting to get the picture

a revelation hes just a fucking actor
on tv feingold holds up a colorfully marked bottle of pills studies them with a shit eating grin
feingold on tv filter my head feels great
thanks to ambutol ill never use aspirin again
feingold gives way to the image of a box of ambutol
schuyler lets elizabeth escort him back near the booth
hes completely absorbed in his own thoughts
have you taken something
are you on drugs
he shakes his head waves his hand dismissively
hes thinking about something else
elizabeth starts dialing
schuyler im calling a friend right now i want you to wait here with me until schuyler tries to sound normal claps her on the arm
while he talks camera finds schuylers other hand which slips stealthily into her purse lying on the seat of the booth
im sorry iii be alright its just been a hard day
listen i gotta use the restroom be right back he moves quickly down a corridor marked restrooms and emergency exit
she looks after him quite puzzled phone still to her ear
schuyler emerges from a back exit looking behind him the emergency alarm sounding
he twirls elizabeths car keys on his finger as he jogs toward her sports car
he unlocks it and the alarm screams for a moment before he figures out how to shut it off then he starts it and peels out
elizabeths car zips through traffic in a chinatown neighborhood full of festive restaurants and shops
hanging red ducks in the window a sign with a phone number in the window tung hoy we deliver in english and chinese
schuyler argues with an old chinese woman behind the counter a cramped funky restaurant rows of celebrity head shots on a wall behind the delivery counter
schuyler pursues the chinese woman as she serves bowls of noodles to a chinese family
hes an actor does tv commercials i know hes ordered from you he had food delivered to an office building on mission many customers very busy i dont know i
dont know damn it
schuyler stalks away from her finds himself facing the wall of signed photographs on wall old and stained pictures the most famous being the likes of ed mcmahon and charo
among them is a newer head shot of feingold with a shit eating grin
below the name william fisher
schuyler leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall stop that what you doing
schuylers already leapt off the counter bolts out the door
schuyler is on the carphone glances from the road to the obverse of the head shot in his hand a phone number before the short list of credits he flips
it to show feingold fisher
schuyler on phone yes mrs
fisher i know its short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today hes perfect
schuyler looks annoyed at what hes hearing
isnt there any way we can get in touch with him now
he makes a quick u turn the tires screeching
pan from the entrance to find schuyler buying a ticket and hurrying in
in the zoo schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy
schuylers pov zoo goers gazing at the animals
camera finds feingold fisher wearing casual clothes eating a popsicle
hes doing his best to supervise three obnoxious children two boys and an older girl
hes just another dad at the zoo far from impressive the wizard of oz after the curtains been pulled
when he makes eye contact with schuyler he pales trying to herd the children together as schuyler moves in on him
he cant get away
schuyler grabs the mans shirt
bill fisher hi

schuyler releases him feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes
schuyler casually shows him the gun the mans eyes widen
get rid of them
to the kids hey everyone heres a twenty
he dangles the bill over their heads the kids cheer leap like dolphins after fish
the girls tallest grabs the cash they run for a nearby concession
schuyler and feingold stroll together
look buddy it was just a job nothing personal yknow
i play my part improvise a little thats what im good at i still do a little stand up ive seen your resume
im sick of foot soldiers ive gotta get to whoevers in charge
christ nobody knows nobody gets the big picture looking away jason tommy cut it out
feingolds boys are throwing rocks at the monkeys
they give their father a look and saunter along
schuylers not interested in the zoo drama
goddammit why do they do that
how do i find them
their offices were abandoned they own the whole building they just move from floor to floor
schuyler takes this in for a moment thinking
they know you youve worked for them
youre going to get me inside
shaking his head uh uh im sorry and all but tell them anything tell them the cops are after you youve gotta talk to someone or youll blow the whistle
no way its too dangerous
schuyler cocks his head steps in front of him
right in his face you dont seem to understand
right here right now im the danger
feingold gets the message
lights off in the building
a battered station wagon rounds a corner pauses before the ramp to the garage entrance the same garage he and christine were once tormented in
feingold drives looking very tense a kiddie seat strapped next to him junk galore hes apparently alone
were here sky
they said theyre on the twelfth floor
behind the seat schuyler crouches under a blanket
drive in then
look what are you gonna do
really i dont know
the station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp
a beefy gate guard behind glass glares at feingold who waves timidly
the steel gate rises and the station wagon drives in
the station wagon parks near an elevator bank a handful of cars a few white crs security vehicles and vans parked nearby
feingold climbs out trying hard not to look scared
elevator doors open and a beefy frightening looking security man in a suit steps out
he looks around carefully as feingold joins him
he takes feingolds arm and pulls him toward the elevator
schuylers pov from the back seat just as the doors open the gate guard steps up behind feingold puts a gun in his back
youre not authorized to be here
he fires schuyler glimpses a spray of blood feingold collapses
the security man grabs the body as it falls starts dragging it out of sight while the gate guard puts a hand to his ear talks into a mini transmitter
in his other hand
he follows the security man out of sight
the elevator doors remain open
with the guards out of sight schuyler rises slowly
he looks stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously sneaking behind vehicles
the main gate is sealed he has no idea how long the guards will be gone
the open elevator doors beckon
schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards starts finding close a rubber bug on its back
schuyler creeps military style on hands and knees the rest of the way to the elevator
he puts a hand in some of feingolds blood winces then gets in the elevator
schuyler presses the button for the top floor
on panel nothing happens the button lights for an instant but goes out again
the elevator wont move
schuylers getting exasperated
on panel he tries buttons allover same story
angle into garage the gate guard jogs toward the elevators pulling his gun
schuyler starts to panic pulls his own gun and points it at the guard who freezes and raises his hands
behind him the security man approaches schuyler from a different angle his gun out
schuyler cant get a bead on both of them
youre a dead man
schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel at base of panel a gold keyhole
closer the letters crs are printed beneath it very small
schuyler shakes his head it couldnt be but what else can he do
angle into garage the guards are fanning out and getting closer
schuyler reaches with one hand for his keys fumbling for the small gold key he received at the start of the game
on panel his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key
it fits into the hole he turns it and pushes the button for
wider as the doors close both guards train their guns but too late
schuylers on his way up
the glass elevator rises through completely blackened spaces
schuyler stares at a bullet hole in the back of the glass elevator a remnant of feingolds murder
he holds the gun in front of himself in both hands
then he closes his eyes steeling himself almost in an attitude of prayer
pitch black but for the lit elevator ascending swiftly through the darkness
schuyler like a solitary spaceship pilot looks upward toward his unknown destination
the digital readout slows as it comes to and stops at
schuyler comes out of his trance slips the revolver back into his jacket pocket keeps a hand there and stands against a wall of the elevator as the doors open
on a bustling noisy commissary
schuyler keeps the gun concealed as he steps out of the elevator nobody here is paying any attention to him anyway
theres a cafeteria style counter along one wall people chatting and laughing at formica tables
amongst others everyone from his game appears to be here
theres the rasta the paramedics with the heart attack victim john and pete from the mens club the girl from the boat the desk clerk and bellhop
also the honduran truck driver the security people from his house the punk and the transit cop
and a lot of engineers
schuyler inches into the room meets the eyes of christine whos just come away from the cafeteria counter with a tray of food
she nearly drops it looks over her shoulder to see if anyone is watching
suddenly schuyler is in front of her backs her into an alcove she holds the tray between them as if to protect herself
what are you doing here
for a moment schuylers not sure
his voice is flat monotonal im back from the dead
listen everythings ok nobody touched your money nobody stole a thing thats impossible i dont give a fuck about the money i wanna know whos behind this who did this
to me how why its just a game
even though shes keeping a surface cool he notices the glass and silverware on her tray rattling
she starts to move toward a table he blocks her path
youre not going anywhere
feingold or or fisher was that just a game too
what are you talking about
i watched him die
schuyler shows her his blood stained hand
christine looks utterly perplexed then shrugs finding a place to put down her tray
seemed like a nice guy actually father of three well look im sure its just another stunt that cant be real taste it
you taste it you fucking vampire
he pushes his palm in her face she flinches swipes him away then puts a finger to her ear as the elevator doors open and the guard and security man
from downstairs burst into the commissary
suddenly the room quiets many others are touching their ears
they all turn in the direction of schuyler and christine
the gate guard gestures at schuyler attempting a smile
could you come with us please
youre not authorized to be here
schuyler grabs christine wraps an arm around her throat puts his gun to her neck
everybody back off
he uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally toward the nearest door she chokes and gasps
the door shuts behind them the stairs only lead up
shit how do we get out christine stomps his foot and elbows his gut breaks free and bolts up the stairs
schuyler catches his breath and pursues
beneath him the stairwell door opens guards pursue
a high ledge surrounds the roof on all four sides a roof entrance at each side as well
the number is painted large for helicopters there are air conditioning vents ducts etc
a muffled alarm sounds as christine bursts through the door followed by schuyler
she spins her back to the edge of the atrium a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken glass skylight a white railing around it
schuyler slams the door a large number painted on it in blue
he throws the heavy bolt
he and christine circle each other warily his gun trained on her
pounding from the other side muffled voices that cant be heard
for the first time christine focuses on the gun in his hand then clutches the railing
wait a minute
schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child its my gun
we didnt give it to you
where did it come from
a gun store
we searched your house
guess you fucked up again
christine touches her ear listening to something then puts her hand to her mouth speaks urgently
hes armed hes got a real gun
real situation real schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the ear piece and hand mike away from christine the wire tears her blouse open
yeah its real all right
schuyler this is all fake tricks its all part of the game stop it
every word out of your mouth is a lie christines desperately panicked fumbling for words
they we gave you a key to the elevator
why would we do that
we wanted you to come up of course you did
so you could kill me or or frame me for murder no no its the game
blanks squibs high tech special effects none of its real
just open that door and ill show you
schuyler hesitates a moment looking in the direction of the door
i open the door and i die
on the door pounding desperate but the alarm drowns out the sounds of voices on the other side
schuyler turns quickly as she takes a step towards him
he points the gun at her again
he looks ready to use it
the following dialog overlaps and collides growing aural chaos you move again i swear ill kill you you bitch
think about it
they followed you every step of the way the cab in the trunk we had a diver they
the guy in honduras the cop on the train there was always a safety net always shut up shut the fuck up
axes dent the metal door which bulges
he looks at the monitor in his hand the one he tore from her body putting it in his own ear letting the rest of the device dangle
radio voice filter just hang in there keep talking him down were on our way weve been trying to end it since you got back our people came to your
house they tried to bring you in from the subway you kept running you werent supposed to keep getting lost you just said you wanted me to come here youre making this up as you go along
please sky please
take a breath and think about it
with my head
schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead the gun trembling in his hand
christines regaining control
schuylers mind whirls he groans almost crying as he considers for the first time that she might be telling the truth
she steps closer
youre all right its ok just relax
radio voice filter are you there
hows he doing
when you open the door the game ends
just open the door
bill fishers out there hes fine nobody got hurt
why would we do the crazy things we did if it wasnt part of a game
we thought you knew that
he looks at her almost ready to lower the gun
he raises his bloody hand to his lips about to taste it
radio voice filter were at the north entrance number just a few more seconds and well nail him schuylers eyes dart toward another doorway on the other side of the
atrium like the one thats bolted
the number is painted on it in red
the handle starts to turn just as christine lunges at him to wrest the gun away
schuyler comes to his senses struggling
the gun goes off the report should be deafening
he spins points the gun at door and fires again several times
christine stiffens falls backwards onto the ground clutching her blood drenched stomach
schuyler just stares
dark blood spills from her mouth as she chokes in pain
i blew it
we blew it
door opens and david steps through
he wears a brightly colored silly looking party hat carries a magnum of champagne bearing a huge bow that reads surprise
blood pumps from his chest
he drops the bottle which shatters
david collapses amidst the broken glass
a blow of the axe severs the deadbolt and door flies open behind schuyler
feingold is the first of a group to come charging through he wears a tuxedo with a rose in the lapel holds the axe
schuyler spins points the gun at this axe wielding man then utterly stunned lowers it in disbelief
feingold looks from schuyler to the wounded christine her agony is painful to watch
he drops the axe with a clatter and runs to her side kneels
his voice cracks
you shot her
looking toward david qh god no
the guard and security man come out on the roof looking very disturbed followed by the rasta and a few others
many are dressed for a party now
feingold looks to their horrified faces
he fucking shot them
ill call an ambulance
the rasta dashes downstairs
schuyler backs away drops the gun staggers over to david
hes gasping for breath
crs employees give the brothers a wide berth move toward feingold and christine
david david no no oh god oh god sky save me i dont wanna die i dont wanna youre not gonna die
im here youre not gonna die
davids already dead eyes wide body limp
with feingold and christine
he holds his colorful cummerbund over her stomach to staunch the bleeding
she chokes in pain
hang on just hang on youre gonna make it that stupid
they stare over at schuyler registering davids death
schuyler is now drenched in his brothers blood rocking him in his arms
most of the assorted crs people move to get out of the building before the cops show murmuring amongst themselves in fear
i thought you could handle it
all the tests
they said you could handle it
christine yells at schuyler unable to stand you fucking psycho you piece of shit how could you schuyler gently lowers his brother and rises like a zombie now
the big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it keeping it out of his reach
schuyler backs away from the body starts to shake looks as if he really has lost his mind
feingold sobs aloud
god why there was no point
it was supposed to be fun
schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded christine who gasps silent curses beyond speech to davids body
he slowly turns to the atrium pit directly in front of him
hes strangely calm
schuyler moves for the edge of the atrium pit
the others react in horror shout no
lunging toward him
davids head suddenly moves he blinks
schuyler leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit
christine jumps to her feet perfectly alert a hand extended screaming just as schuyler catapults himself into space and schuyler sees this too late he and david make terrified helpless
eye contact across the void arms outstretched
schuyler has time to register his irrevocable error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an agonizing moment
schuyler crashes through the skylight tumbling sparkling shards surround him like stars as he plunges spins screaming
rapid cuts the clown christines face schuyler and david as children his fathers head striking the landing
these flash past so rapidly we cant quite process them
on schuylers face as he experiences the epiphany that comes before the end
brilliant angelic light suddenly illuminates him his eyes roll into his head closing angle from above the lights are real theyve come on to show schuylers impact he lands on
his back arms outstretched eyes squeezed shut and is swallowed by an enormous inflated lifesaving cushion that covers the floor of the atrium
schuyler bounces in the cushion a few times gradually coming to a rest harmless bits of breakaway glass showering down around him
he doesnt move a muscle his eyes still closed
closer on his face
his eyes open
his pov up the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the building around the atrium
the full moon in the very center through the hole in the glass
all the lighted glass elevators come to earth packed with people
schuyler stares upward mouth open motionless
david comes running from an elevator leaps up onto the cushion and bounces over to schuyler a huge smile on his face
hey bro how you doin
getting no response david hops closer squats by schuylers side
admit it you werent bored
schuyler remains motionless davids worried now grabs his arm and starts shaking him
sky cmon sky schuyler begins to laugh a tremendous catharsis
david laughs too greatly relieved as he helps schuyler to his feet
the two brothers clutch each other for support on the bouncing surface laughing
crs employees have gathered around the cushion cheering and applauding
schuyler wipes his eyes shaking his head with amazement
then he hauls back and slugs david in the jaw sending him flying onto his back on the cushion
more cheers from the crowd as if they were watching a boxing match
the hallelujah chorus from handels messiah plays
schuyler and david enter together from the atrium the cushion deflates behind them
david licks blood from his lips rubs his jaw
youve been wanting to do that for a long long time havent you
schuyler half smiles
the security man unlocks schuylers handcuffs giving him back his gun which schuyler stares at
like theyd really leave a loaded gun lying around
they went over the whole place with a metal detector then packed that thing with blanks
they turn a corner into the main lobby schuyler absently pockets the gun looks up in wonder
schuylers pov a surprise party a stereo streamers and balloons a champagne fountain cake and food
crs employees mostly ordinary looking office workers clap and cheer for schuyler
they wear party hats blow plastic horns
smiling people eager to offer congratulations surround him
hes pretty shaky like a newborn calf
john and pete shake his hand
good one buddy really had you going didnt we
waitll you try level two
a wink joke
the rasta slaps his back schuyler instinctively looks over his shoulder for a gag message
that look on your face up there
shit man i almost lost it
the receptionist pops a bottle of dom perignon hands it to sky
awesome game best ive seen
not knowing what else to do schuyler takes a slug
the girl from the boat kisses his cheek
technicians men with stunts unlimited t shirts the nurse from the asylum the security people crs guards agents all want a piece of him at once
the messiah fades and an r b band breaks into rousing music as feingold approaches and sticks a cigar in his mouth lights it
sure glad you jumped compadre
otherwise i was supposed to throw you off
whispering its not strictly legal so dont tell anyone
a beat off schuylers look the cigar
its a monte cristo straight from havana
christine approaches wobbly and dazed herself she touches his arm
her voice is soft for the first time accents gone

nods slowly i think so
im pretty much a method actress yknow

he gives her a drag on his cigar
look i have to know
whos really in charge
she shrugs blows a smoke ring and sticks her finger through it
she winks and strolls off
schuyler smiles looking after her
dancing is starting up in bg
a clutch of non crs people approach tentatively including plympton elizabeth maria and jack
they all look very confused
what is this sky
we got a call from your brother said there was a surprise party

schuyler laughs gives her a hug surprising her
he still has a giddy smile plastered on his face
if you wanted to borrow my car you couldve just asked i know liz ive been an idiot and im sorry
yeah im good really
happy to be alive

he moves away quickly
schuyler flushes and moves away from a urinal
david waits a few feet away by the sinks and mirrors schuyler starts slightly
so whats the object of the game
a beat what game
rinsing his hands is it always like this
mine was a little weirder
tell you about it sometime
david pulls out a colored envelope slips it into schuylers shirt
schuyler looks at him curiously as he dries his hands
dont bother opening it now
opening it i thought it was a gift
well no the card was the gift the rest was up to you
camera follows as david hurries out of the rest room schuyler behind him flipping pages of a long long bill we rejoin the party which is now in full swing
schuyler stands alone at the periphery of the dance floor with the bill
he hits the bottom line
he blinks and gasps
christine appears taking his hand and pulling him away
where are we going
does it matter
they move into a stairwell and start climbing o
their hands all over each other
we hear the music and festivities continuing in bg
camera holds for a beat on a sign painted on the wall with an arrow upward level
