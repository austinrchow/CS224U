one word explodes towards us with cold brutality commando
leaves us in darkness
and we hear a growing roar
a frightening rumble
tight on the churning compactor of a garbage truck
the camera pulls back and we see the truck battered and olive grey
a bored garbage man with a kerchief over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it moves along the street
as lawson awakes with a start
hes late s a little worn
he shakes his wife
the garbage men
maybe they changed the schedule
lawson listens to the noise as it approaches finally throws his feet into his bedroom slippers
he runs into the pantry dragging several ungainly plastic trash bags
the truck sound is closer now
we can see it at the end of the long driveway
lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered and half full metal cans starts running down the driveway
wait a minute wait a minute
the truck stops at the bottom of the driveway
lawson stumbles his way towards it smiles
i was afraid youd miss me cooke the man behind the truck pulls an ingram submachine gun into view
at the same moment the cab of the garbage truck is kicked open and diaz the driver leans out similarly armed
dont worry we wont
and they cut lawson down the bullets raking across his body and the cans
lawson falls back spread eagled
the garbage cans pierced and leaking roll toward the camera blocking our view just as cooke moves close to administer a coup de grace
forrestal grins into the camera
you aint seen nothin yet
camera adjusts to show us that forrestal is just now closing the trunk of a big new cadillac
hes showing it to diaz who nods and makes noncommital noises as forrestal continues the hype
as trunk closes hear that sound
you think the japanese invented that
bullshit we did
sure we lost it for a while but we got it back
diaz gets into the car
sure get in
i know what youre gonna say
but take it from me you dont want leather its hot it cracks its trouble
and look at the head room
youre not gonna have a problem
diaz starts the engine
go ahead start it up
thats power thats performance thats jesus christ forrestal has said this last because diaz has thrown the car into reverse knocking down a big display
diaz slams the car into forward hits the accelerator and roars across the display room floor
the car slams into forrestal flinging his body across the hood
the car continues on crashes through the outside window and disappears down the street
dangling working lights illuminate the night
the tuna fleet is in
mid thirties well muscled bennett helps another worker wrestle a net of fish into a hold then he wipes his brow and shouts over the
thats all for me les
bennett steps off the boat crosses over another boat and steps onto his boat
bennett starts his boat revs the throttle then pulls away from the other boats
the wind whips his hair as he cruises out into the night
the boat moves away from us then whoom the boat explodes into a fireball sending debris high into the air
a man comes out of the shadows on the dock and watches the explosion the fiery lights splashing onto his face
its cooke the garbage man
main titles begin
and along with them we hear music
the camera skims over snow capped peaks pine trees twinkling dew in the morning light
then we see it an s version of a log cabin
with crisp clean lines
energy efficient and snug
as a giant figure descends from the mountains behind the house balancing a giant log on his right shoulder and carrying a chain saw in his left hand
this is colonel john alexander matrix
hes in his mid thirties
a man of raw power and vitality
and something else joy
joy and a sense of calm
matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin
he puts down the log and chain saw then picks up firewood and begins to split it with awesome single swipes of an axe
as a shadow comes stealthily alongside the house and begins to slowly and cautiously advance on matrix
matrix doesnt turn or otherwise seem to see the other person
but he reacts to little things cracks
scampers away startled
responds with a faint creak while reflects a dull indistinct figure approaching matrix from behind
none of the above escapes matrixs eye
and then at the last possible second he whirls and confronts new angle s matrix sweeps up the intruder his eleven year old daughter jenny
she laughs as he tickles her
put me down
she tickles him back on his neck and ribs
he laughs puts her down
i surrender i surrender
he raises his hands open trusting
instantly she attacks again then runs like hell as he pursues her matrixs blazer is parked here
father and daughter sit across from each other she has a cone he has a dish
he uses his spoon to steal some of her flavor and jimmies
he gets away with this twice before she pokes him on the nose with the cone
he wipes ice cream from his face
matrix and jenny are trout fishing in a beautiful stream
a deer tentatively approaches and matrix and jenny take food from a knapsack and hold it out for the deer
the deer comes closer takes the food from them then licks their hands
shows jenny karate moves
she tries a move on him and he pretends shes knocked him over
gives jenny a piggyback ride over the bridge that crosses the stream as they head back to the cabin
matrix goes to open the refrigerator in his cabin a stops
taped to the door is a cutout of a heart jenny is peeking at matrix from around the corner of the kitchen
he sees her he smiles and they meet and hug
matrix sits at the table as jenny serves lunch
the view through the expansive picture window is breathtaking
matrix leafs through some of jennys rocknroll magazines
when i was a boy and rock and roll came to east germany the communists said it was subversive
they were right
whats in this
you dont want to know
suddenly matrix gets an odd look on his face
he stands cocks his head
he shushes her puts his hand up to block the sun as he peers through the picture window
now jenny and the audience can see what matrixs keen senses have already heard an approaching aircraft
army markings coming towards the house
then veering off for a landing
you said you wouldnt go away again
you said you were through im not going anywhere
three men get out
general franklin kirby is in the lead
hes in his early s fit energetic and as we can see the pilot of the craft
hes wearing rugged army class cs
the two young soldiers with him are harris and jackson
they wear bdus and carry carbines
at a look from kirby they fan out and watch the cabin
kirby approaches the cabin
john come on out
startled kirby whirls to see matrix standing behind him
silent and smooth
just like always
he smiles and he and matrix come together and shake hands
i better be
you taught me
he affectionately squeezes kirbys shoulder
jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men
i need to talk to your dad jenny
no way jose
matrix gives her a sharp look and jenny grudgingly goes back inside
kirby and matrix begin to walk as clouds billow high above the mountaintops around them
someones killing your men
you gave them new identities
there must have been a leak
bennett have all been hit
whos doing it
x youve made enemies all over the x world john
it could be the syrians the south africans the russians or a terrorist group
theyre gonna find you
matrix looks toward the cabin
jenny is watching him through a window
matrix turns back to kirby and they begin walking back to the cabin
we were going to make a normal x life here
im going x into the city to coordinate with the federal people
in the meantime jackson and harris will stay with you
matrix looks the two soldiers over
they any good
but not as good as you were
watches the chopper lift off and fly away
jenny subdued comes out of the cabin
is it bad
im not leaving you
if thats what you mean
then it cant be bad
an intense look comes over matrixs face then in a blur he sweeps up jenny in his arms just before machine gun fire blasts the cabin
the volley of firing shatters the windows and rips open harris chest his blood splattering against the cabin
matrix still clutching jenny dives through the door into the cabin and hits the floor
jackson catches a round in the shoulder spins to the ground then crawls through the door after matrix
the three of them lie on the cabin floor as the firing continues to blast away at harris body the rounds smacking into the side of the cabin
then the firing stops
how bad you hit
ill make it
ive got to get my rifle from the shed
keep an eye out theyll be coming
youre downwind the air currents might tip them off
looks at matrix like hes crazy you think ill smell them coming
matrix and jenny move low to the floor toward her bedroom
stay out of sight ill be right back
jenny goes into her bedroom and matrix goes out the backdoor
he races to the shed unlocks it goes inside to a high tech cabinet and opens it
inside is an h k assault rifle two big banana clips of ammunition and a baretta js pistol
matrix pulls the weapons out and readies them
jackson peers out the window sees nothing then edges back to the floor
two hands whip a garotte around his neck and choke the struggling jackson to death
hears a thump and sticks her head out from under her bed to look but sees nothing
suddenly footsteps approach her bedroom door
she pulls her head back under the bed just as two boots enter her bedroom
a knife is attached to one of the boots
matrix puts the pistol in his waistband and slams home a clip in the rifle
he races out of the shed rushes to the cabin and opens the backdoor
jackson garotte still around his neck falls lifelessly through the door straight into the camera
matrix ducks as jackson glances off him and crumples to the ground
matrix h k rifle held ready silently enters then moves carefully through the cabin
he peers into the den and sees diaz one of the men who killed matrixs men sitting in a chair looking at jennys matrix steps forward and points his rifle
directly at diaz
where is she
diaz smiles and puts his feet up on a table
mellow out man
we cant talk business with you waving guns in peoples faces
matrix puts the rifle against diazs forehead and cocks the trigger
the smile vanishes from diazs face
shes safe major
whether she stays that way
is up to you
my people got some business with you
matrix hears a noise outside glances out the window and sees two vehicles racing away from the house
and if you want your kid back you gotta cooperate
matrix levels the h k and blasts diaz in the chest
diaz and the chair are jerked violently backward
matrix jumps out of the cabin and races to the blazer its hood up
he checks the engine
torn wires stick up the distributor cap is disconnected and broken
he looks down the mountain and sees the vehicles winding along the mountain roads
matrix slams the blazers hood
puts his weapons on the seat
then releases the brake
then one hand on the wheel the other on the door frame he begins to push the car
he steers it not towards the dirt road but towards the shoulder where a steep incline leads downward
since the blazer is pointed the wrong way matrix is pushing it uphill the effort is incredible
the veins on his neck stand out
with a scream he puts everything hes got into it
and finally it begins to roll downwards
matrix leaps in
snaps on the drivers shoulder belt
reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his body as well
the blazer rolls over the edge
as it bounces wildly down the degree slope
matrix fights to control the wheel
a low hanging branch smashes the windshield
it takes another curve
camera pans up and we see the blazer coming closer and closer by this direct route
it barrels down the mountainside out of control smashing through trees bounding off rocks dropping like a stone
matrix is taking a terrible beating
but hes almost down to the road
ahead of the black vehicle
the two vehicles narrowly miss each other the dark car almost spins out
it careens past the other car slams into a huge boulder flips rolls over and over
of this mishap rushing down the road
the wrecked blazer is burning then suddenly explodes
the camera holds on this what looks like matrixs funeral pyre
then we see movement and see a bloodied and injured matrix crawling away from the intense fire
he stops and looks back at the destroyed blazer
a large group of armed soldiers start to surround matrix
he stands up cut bleeding
the lead man approaches to frisk him
matrix elbows him in the stomach drives his fist into the mans adams apple pulls him down cracks the mans vertebrae grabs the dead mans rifle and slams the butt
against the face on the man closing on him
the mans jaw shatters
but three more men are immediately on matrix and they wrestle him to the ground
he forces his way up again the three men still all over him
matrixs eyes suddenly widen as he looks at two boots with an attached knife then up at the man standing in them
its bennett the man we saw die
i thought you were bennett reaches up with a bulky pistol and points it at matrix
he fires at point blank range
matrix is blasted backward to the ground
bennett and general ernesto arius in guerrila fatigues walk through a large warehouse filled with tanks jeeps and soldiers carrying bazookas machine guns mortars etc
it looks like a small army
an intense white light shimmers at the camera almost as if the light were floating on water
it is so bright it hurts our eyes
matrixs motionless body is lying on a slab of a table
his eyes slowly open as he looks at the same bright light
that light in on the ceiling of the small room he is lying in
matrix groggily shakes his head sits up a little and sees bennett holding up the bulky gun
general arius approaches matrix
remember me major
i remember the people you tortured and killed
you dont understand a country like val verde major
it needs a president with an iron hand
it needs my hand again
why tell me
because youre going to return to val verde and kill the president you helped to overthrow me
why dont you have bennett do it he was there with me
but president velasquez trusts you after all he made you a hero of the revolution
while captain bennett left shall we say under a cloud
glances at bennett he enjoyed the killing a little too much
you trained me major
you can get close to velasquez you will kill him
weve gone to alot of trouble to find you
we faked bennetts death so kirby would get nervous and lead us to you
and now that i have you youll do what i tell you
and if i dont
arius looks at matrix for a beat then arius nods to bennett
bennett opens a sliding door to a closet and matrix sees jenny
she is gagged and tied tightly to a chair
she is shaking from fear and her eyes are wet with tears
matrix lunges up from the table but his hands and feet are chained to the table and he is stopped
bennett wheels jenny out of the closet over to arius
arius begins to finger her hair
so pretty there are many things im going to teach her
l matrix fights at the chains like a crazy man but he cant move
arius fingers the shirt collar around her neck
you kill velasquez major and youll get her back
you try anything else
and ill send her to you in pieces
general kirby stands in front of the cabin looking at the bodies of jackson harris and diaz
soldiers are searching around and inside the cabin
one of the soldiers approaches kirby
any sign of matrix
no sir just those bodies
you think theres more
if hes still alive id expect a lot more
a long silver limo pulls up to an lax terminal and parks
cooke is at the wheel
matrix in a tropical suit and bennett are in the rear seat sully and henriques on foldout seats facing them
sully will make sure you get on the plane and henriques will stay with you to make sure you get off
if i dont get a call from either one of them shes dead
he motions and henriques opens the car door and brings matrix out with him
sully follows them
matrix looks back at bennett through the open door
ill be back bennett
ill be ready
they eye each other then sully shuts the door and matrix watches the limo drive off
henriques and sully flank matrix and they enter the terminal
the three of them pass through the terminal
matrix looks toward two police officers that are right next to them but he remains silent
henriques matrix and sully walk through the x ray booths as the security guard watches then they continue on
they approach the boarding gate
sully hands henriques and matrix their tickets then sully stuffs a
bill in matrixs breast pocket
have some beers in val verde matrix itll give everyone more time with your daughter
matrix looks down at the bill then up at sully
youre a nice guy sully i like you
thats why ill kill you last
henriques takes matrixs arm and moves him toward the gate
open your mouth again and ill nail it shut
matrix looks up at a wall clock
and henriques board the plane as sully watches from the boarding area
henriques and matrix enter the plane
a stewardess smiles at them and examines their tickets
first class seats seven a and b
they are the last passengers to be seated
they walk down the aisle matrix takes the window seat and henriques the aisle seat
a noise attracts matrixs attention and he watches the door to the entrance tunnel close
the stewardesses prepare for the takeoff as the planes engines begin to rumble
matrix edgily looks around the plane
the stewardess approaches him
you must fasten your seat belt sir
matrix looks out the window and sees sully looking right back at him through the waiting room window
matrix turns to the stewardess
could i have a blanket and pillow
she takes them down from the upper compartment and hands them to matrix
the plane is beginning to move
matrix begins to arrange the blanket and pillow
as soon as the stewardess moves off matrix delivers an incredibly sudden blow to henriques temple
henriques eyes roll back in his head blood trickles out of his mouth his body goes limp and he falls against matrix
its happened so quickly none of the other passengers have noticed it
matrix throws the blanket over henriques body looks around then quickly forces henriques neck down toward his chest
matrix stands and opens the overhead luggage rack
he picks up the blanket covered body and puts it in the overhead rack
the nd stewardess comes by
sir can i help you with that
its no problem
he smiles at her and she smiles back
he closes the luggage compartment door and turns to the stewardess
how long is this flight
we land in val verde in exactly eleven hours
she moves down the aisle
matrix looks down at his digital watch and presses a button
appears on the watchface
instantly it starts counting down
matrix starts down the aisle
sir during takeoff you must im airsick
he pushes by her
matrix moves to the service elevator squeezes in hits the controls and starts to descend
the elevator stops in the service area of the big plane
matrix gets out of the elevator and looks out a port
the place is moving faster
he turns and moves to a door marked cargo hold
he pulls the door starts to bend then the lock suddenly snaps
he opens the door and crawls inside
the passengers sit unaware of anything unusual
a close up of the latch on the luggage compartment holding henriques body shows the latch imperceptively the plane leaves the terminal area and turns toward the runway
sully watches plane approach the runway
intercut the pilot talking with the control tower to clear the plane for takeoff
the plane begins to roll down the runway
matrix crawls through the crowded hold
without looking he starts to push a box out of the way and a doberman pinscher snarls and flashes his teeth right into the camera
matrix jerks his hand away from the dog cage just as the pinschers teeth push between the bars
the plane starts to taxi down the runway
the luggage compartment holding henriques body edges open and a small corner of the blanket comes out
the passengers sit unaware
matrix has reached the area immediately above the planes landing gear
the noise is deafening
he digs his hands under the lip of the gear retract equipment and lifts with all his might
nothing moves for a beat he continues to strain mightily and the cowling starts to move
with a final grunt he lifts it up and pushes it out of the way
the ground rushes beneath the airplane
matrix swings his feet into the hole
the plane takes off and roars into the sky clearing the marshes at the end of the runway
matrix drops through the hole toward the moving ground
he drops down out of the plane twenty five feet above the ground and splashes into the shallow water with terrific impact
the plane zooms overhead
matrix lies still bobbing in the water
sully is on the phone
it just took off
matrix comes out of the water and looks at his watch
he looks at the terminal in the distance and begins running toward it
a uniformed latino pilots a speeding war boat in the pacific
bennett standing on the rear deck watches arius hang up the microphone on the two way radio and then arius disappears below deck
jenny is huddled in a darkened cabin below
she wipes the tears from her eyes
the door opens some light comes in and arius enters the cabin
he moves toward jenny and looks at her for a long beat
your father has just left for val verde he should be back with you soon
does that make you happy
arius sits down right next to her
he runs his fingers along her shoulder
is there anything else that would make you happy
watching my dad kick your balls down your throat
matrix jumps into the back of a fire truck that drives by the rear of the terminal
sully walking through the terminal stops as he sees a girl cindy talking on a pay phone
shes a gorgeous stewardess in her late twenties
hi lance its me
yes that cindy
they just cancelled my x to vancouver
cont sully takes off his dark glasses eats her up with his eyes and adjusts his tie
i thought since im laid over we could
no laid over lance
she slams down the phone and does a slow burn
then she turns picks up her flight bag starts to head off and finds her path suddenly blocked by sully
sounds like you need a date
fuck off shithead
she pushes by him
sully watches her go smiles and then begins to follow her
a matrix wearing a ground crewmans jacket is now inside the terminal
he looks desperately for sully
passengers mill ahead of matrix behind him and to the side but there is no sully
matrix races through the crowded terminal looks up
and suddenly stops
there sully is
sully is following cindy along a downstairs walkway
matrix slows down then begins to track sully as sully follows the girl
cindy enters the parking garage and approaches the passenger side of her ragtop sunbeam alpine convertible
she unlocks and opens the door leaving the keys in the lock then she lowers the top
the lowering of the top reveals sully facing her on the other side of the car
you know what i could give you
sullys smile disappears
he looks at her takes his sunglasses out of his coat pocket nuts them back on then turns and walks off
cindy watches him to make sure he leaves
all of a sudden a giant arm encircles her waist from behind
she looks down at the giant arm unable to see matrix sqatting behind her
im not moving
im not going to hurt you
thats what they all say
a step to the side
i have to move to do that
matrix removes his arm from her waist
knees shaking cindy steps aside
matrix leans into the car grabs the passenger seat yanks it out and places it on the ground at cindys feet
cindy mouth gaping open looks at the passenger seat now at her feet
cindy automatically starts to get in the car
you forgot your keys
he puts her car keys in her hand
she crawls across where the passenger seat had been and sits in the drivers seat
matrix sits on the floor where the passenger seat had been and closes the passenger door
just do what i tell you and ill let you go
ive got to give karate junitsu judo and kung fu lessons to my students at seven thirty
youre not gonna make it
she starts the car
sully drives by them in his porsche targa
i knew you were going to say that
she pops the clutch too fast the tires squeal and matrix is slammed back against the car floor
sully drives out of the airport garage and enters the flow of traffic
after a beat the sunbeam lurches out of the garage and begins to follow sully
in the sunbeam matrix checks his watch
cindy concentrates on following sullys porsche up ahead
dont get offended by this question but
are you going to kill me or something
sully drives his porsche at medium speed along century blvd
he goes through as it starts to turn red
cindy eases her foot from the accelerator as she prepares to stop for the light
matrix puts his foot on top of hers and pushes down on the accelerator
the sunbeam runs through the red light
as dusk approaches sully drives along the freeway occasionally glancing into his rearview mirror
cindy and matrix continue in the sunbeam keeping a distance between themselves and sully
cindy is still at the wheel
outside the car dusk is approaching
can i ask you what this is all about
somebody wants to kill my daughter and me
i dont know your daughter but a ive known you for only ten minutes and i want to kill you too
as dusk approaches sully drives his porsche into the galleria
cindy pulls her sunbeam in two cars behind him
sully parks his car gets out carrying a briefcase goes to the glass elevator stares at two pretty valley girls takes his dark glasses off and joins them in the
matrix and cindy are sitting in her car watching sully
as soon as the elevator disappears matrix grabs cindys keys from the ignition and takes her arm
she opens her door matrix slides next to her
and they and they exit from her car
he moves her quickly toward the elevator
if youre in a hurry dont let me hold you up
the elevator returns and they get in
the galleria interiors runs around the perimeter of a three story open vaulted area
in addition to the glass elevator several tiered steps and banks of escalators run up and down the levels
lots of decorative banners in hot colors decorate the open area
the top level is particularly active
restaurants bars video parlor movie theatre
its the hub of valley nightlife lots of shoppers and kids just hanging out
matrix and cindy exit from the elevator onto the top level next to the wide open vaulted space
matrix immediately searches with his eyes for sully
she takes a quick step to get away but matrix immediately grabs her arm and pulls her back toward him so they are now nose to nose
he motions to the other side of the top level and we see sully walking
whispered anxious my daughters been kidnapped and hes my only chance of finding her
if he sees me or i lose him theyll kill her
i need you to follow him if i get too close hell run
cindy looks back at matrix in shock
pleading desperate please help me youre my only x chance
shes got less than ten hours left
cindy doesnt know what to say
matrix still holding her arm shakes her in desperation
whispered desperate cindy looks at matrix glances toward sully then looks back at matrix
x matrix lets her arm go and she rubs it gingerly
take it easy all right
she continues to look at the pleading matrix then she turns and hesitantly begins walking toward sully
sully walks by a video game parlor ogles some girls checks his watch then heads for the bar on this level
cindy walks around the open space following sully
she glances back tentatively at matrix then she keeps going
matrix moves in the other direction around the open space all the while watching sully and cindy
new wave music plays as valley gals and sharp dudes dance and mingle about
sully can dig this scene he puts his dark glasses back on
he sits at a table puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders a drink
a latin man wearing a leisure suit looking completely out of place in a joint like this enters the bar and stares at a girl with purple hair
he continues into the bar catches sullys eye and sits down at the table with him
he reaches under the table and slides the briefcase away from sully until its next to himself then hands sully still under the table a bunch of passports
cindy approaches the bar hesitates then looks back at matrix
across the open space he nods urging her forward
she hesitantly moves forward
cindy enters the bar then sees a young security guard cates coming out of the mens room
she moves around a corner so matrix cant see her and she stops the guard
theres a huge guy across the way who either honestly needs my help or hes an escaped mental fruitcake
take a look
cates moves into the doorway casually glances at matrix watching the bar then cates moves out of matrixs view
he removes the walkie talkie from his belt and speaks into it
biggs you there
another security guard biggs a muscular black kid is flirting with some valley girls and ignoring the constant beeping of his walkie talkie
this aint no mexican shit im talkin maui wowie
tired of the beeping he picks up his walkie talkie
what it is zitface
theres a guy up here who may be a wacko
i dont think i can handle him alone
cool down puke breath ill be right there
smiling to girls wanna see me kick some ass
matrix is getting anxious
he looks at his watch
sully is in conversation with the latin man unaware of whats going on outside
cindy sneaks a look outside and sees biggs and his two valley girls approaching matrix
biggs confidently walks along the top level the girls following
he stops abruptly as he sees matrix his eyes bulge and he retreats into an alcove and pulls out his walkie talkie
attention all units
emergency on the theater level
suspect is six foot two brown hair
and is one gigantic motherfucker
cates and cindy are still out of matrixs view
youd better stay here miss
he exits from the bar and moves toward matrix
cindy waits biting her lip wondering if shes done the wrong thing
sully still talking to the latin looks up and finally notices cindy
he moves through the dancers toward her
matrix anxiously glances at his watch then looks up toward the bar
cindy comes out into the doorway where he can see her
she glances behind him then helplessly looks right at him
matrix noticing her glance behind him turns around
five security guards are now approaching him
sully moves toward cindy
at the doorway
just as he is about to say something to her he hears a commotion and glances outside
matrix turns from the guards to point at cindy in the bar and he suddenly sees sully approaching her
sully looks out toward the commotion and suddenly sees matrix
and matrix is pointing right at him
sully runs bumping off of cindy and races out onto the top level
matrix seeing him run turns back to the guards advancing on him and smashes the lead guard biggs right in the face
biggs is blasted backward into the other guards knocking two of them down
matrix sees sully running and then looks wheres hes headed
a phone booth
jenny looks up as bennett stands in front of her
he raises a gun and points it at her face
he jumps over the railing leaps across an open chasm drops eight feet toward a stairway then rushes upward
sully gets in the phone booth and quickly drops in a quarter
in the b
matrix is racing right toward the booth
sully tries to dial as fast as he can
his face starts to contort as he sees matrix getting closer and closer
sullys face is wet with sweat
sully pulls out his gun and fires through the windowpane at the steadily looming matrix
he wont get another chance
matrix picks up the entire phone booth rips it from the wall and smashes it against the railing
people all over the galleria begin to scream
the latin man dashes out of the bar with his gun drawn
two real los angeles police officers racing up the escalator with their guns drawn see the latin
cindy drops to the ground as the officers aim at him
the latin shoots away at the officers blasting one in the chest and knocking him rolling and tumbling backwards down the escalator
the other officer fires away at the latin hitting him twice
the latin slams agains the railing the briefcase bursting open
thousands of bills come rushing out of the briefcase and begin drifting downward
the latin blood oozing out his stomach and eyes drifting in his head reaches over the railing to grasp futilely at the money
he reaches too far
the latin drops over the third floor railing falling right through the drifting bills and crashes to the floor
matrix tries to force open the broken phone booth door to get at sully but the bloodied sully crawls out the other way through a broken window pane hangs from
the railing and drops to the stairwell below
people continue to scream and hug the floor
sully turns around and blasts a shot at matrix above
he races down the stairwell stepping on the huddled bodies
a security guard rushes him and sully blasts him dead
matrix running along the third level sees sully jump off the stairwell and get into a glass elevator
it starts to descend
matrix looks desperately around looks at one of the giant decorative banners spanning the ceiling jumps onto the railing and tears loose the banners end
the lapd cop kneels and aims his gun at matrix and prepared to fire
cindy is running right at the cop
matrix jumps hanging onto the banner
cindy knocks the cops aim away
the gun fires missing matrix
matrix swings down to the lower level and crashes right through the glass into the elevator with sully
the cop comes up from the ground and looks at cindy
she looks back at him uncertainly
he starts to bring the gun toward her and she moves quickly to a door marked stairwell and disappears
matrix and sully are both lying bloodied and dazed in the elevator
it descends silently the two men lying in the broken glass
the elevator reaches the parking garage and the doors open
sully crawls out and dazedly begins to trot toward his car
seconds behind him matrix stumbles and chases him
cindy races out of a door and comes out onto sepulveda
a cop down the block points at her
she looks around desperately trying to figure out what to do
sully in his corvette burns rubber crashes through the wooden parking arm and heads out onto sepulveda
matrix in cindys sunbeam is right on sullys heels
sully shoots wildly out onto sepulveda blasting his horn as he swerves into the wrong lane
cindy watches him zoom by
she looks down the block
now the cop is running toward her
matrix rips out onto sepulveda
cindy races out onto the street her hands held up to stop him
matrix hits the brakes almost hitting her as the car skids out of control to the side
she runs toward it
matrix puts the car back in gear floors it and cindy dives into the car as it starts to race by
matrix speeds down sepulveda chasing sully
cindy on her stomach moves herself into a sitting position
shes now sitting on the floor where matrix ripped out the seat
who in the hell are you
matrix doesnt answer
you steal my car rip the seat out then kidnap me
you make me miss my hair appointment
you beg me to help you and your daughter which i very kindly do
you get me into a shoot out where people are getting killed and blood is spurting out all over the place
sully comes speeding up coldwater canyon
the traffic is lighter now and matrix pushes the sunbeams engine to the limit to catch him
i watch you rip a phone booth from the wall and swing from the ceiling like tarzan
i stop the cops from killing you and then they start chasing me
matrix looks at the corvette changes gears and speeds the sunbeam faster
sully pulls onto mulholland then looks in the mirror
matrixs headlights are getting closer
sully floors the corvette sliding around the curves along mulholland
matrix keeps pace
will you tell me what the hells going on
sullys corvette disappears around a curve matrix cuts the corner tightly and suddenly a large truck look out
matrix swerves the sunbeam at the last moment just grazes by the truck and keeps going
cindy has slid down in her seat and covered her face with her hands
she now opens her fingers peeks through then lowers her hands
she looks at matrix
howd you ever get a drivers license
he revs the engine bringing the car right up behind sully and rams it against the back of sullys corvette
they swerve around another curve
matrix brings the car up close again
sully half glances back and fires a wild shot
the windshield on the sunbeam splinters
matrix floors the car and completely smashes it into the back of sullys car
sullys car skids off the road flips a couple times then crashes into the inside face of the cliff
matrix and cindy skid off the road and crash into the x inside face of the cliff
matrix looks over at cindy whos reeling from the effects of the crash
i think im dead
matrix sees sully trying to get out of his car
gun in hand sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed car
matrix approaches kicks the gun out of sullys hand and picks the gun up
matrix empties sullys pockets and finds his wallet and a motel key
he picks sully up an ankle in each hand so that hes holding sully upside down
he begins walking with him
where is she sully
matrix is approaching the sunbeam as cindy is getting out
he swings sully by the heels and beats sullys head against the fender leaving another dent in the already beat up car
thats my car matrix
matrix continues to carry sully upside down
i cant hear you sully
loyalty is touching sully but its not important in your life right now
we see matrix walk right up to the edge of a steep drop along mulholland drive
he has walked out of cindys sight
x but take gravity
he extends his arms and dangles sully upside down over the sharp drop
the los angeles basin is spread out below degrees of twinkling lights
gravity is very important in your life right now
sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to his face starts to redden it
matrix lets go with his right arm
sullys head drops a foot matrixs left arm drops a little then adjusts to the new weight
i have to warn you sully
this is my weak arm
you cant kill me matrix
you x need me to find your daughter
where is she
he shakes sully moving him like a fish on a line
i dont know but cooke knows
i could take you where im supposed to meet him
but you wont
matrix uses his right hand to take something from his pocket and he dangles it in front of sully
its sullys motel key
because i already know where
fear starts to show in sullys face for the first time as he stares at the key
he tried to grab at the key x but matrix pulls it out of his reach
remember when i promised to kill you last sully
l hope flickers in sullys eyes
he drops a screaming sully and sully crashes to the rocks below
cindy is looking at her sunbeam which is smashed to shit as matrix approaches
now you dont have a car
matrix looks at sullys car which is lying on its side
he pushes incredibly hard against it and it slams to the ground right side up
now i do
they get into sullys beat up car and matrix starts the engine and puts the car in gear to drive away
wait a minute
matrix looks at her
whatd you do with sully
let him go
he floors the accelerator leaves rubber and blasts out of there
waves crash against a rocky shore
arius boat settles next to a dock and several latinos in guerrilla fatigues secure the boats lines
arius bennett and jenny exit from the boat and walk quickly down the dock
a large estate
a guard patrols the perimeter wall of he sees figures approaching and turns on a bright searchlight outlining arius bennett and jenny as they approach the estate
a second guard admits them into an expensively furnished mansion bennett goes into a side room to join several soldiers
arius and jenny walk down a marble passageway passing several lavishly decorated rooms
arius stops her in front of a door and unlocks the door
they enter a room that has been stripped of all furnishings the windows boarded over
arius locks the door again then looks up and down at jenny
she takes a few hesitant steps backward
he gazes at her then steps out into the hallway and closes the door
suddenly the lights in the room go out plunging jenny into darkness
jenny moves against a wall slides to a sitting position on the floor and begins to shiver from the cold
matrix is driving sullys car cindy sitting next to him through the streets of los angeles
they are moving rapidly
im sorry i got you involved in this
then why wont you tell me what its about
matrix reaches into his pocket pulls out his wallet opens it and hands it to cindy
its about her
cindy looks at a photo tucked into a wallet clear plastic photo insert
its a color photo of jenny
is she the one that was kidnapped
some people are using her to force me to do a job
if i dont get to her soon theyll kill her
did you do the job
i knew theyd kill her even if i did it
the only chance she has is if i get to her before they know what im doing
cindy looks at the photo

i was in laos when it happened so i came home intending to raise her
but on her third birthday i was in lebanon

he looks over at cindy then looks away
that part of my life is over with
all that matters to me now is jenny
matrix drives the car into a parking lot in front of a motel and parks
matrix looks out the window toward the motel
then matrix looks down at his watch
it changes to as we watch
matrix gets out of the car closes the door and starts to move across the parking lot
he stops as he notices cindy getting out of the car too
whatre you doing
helping you get her back
she closes the door and joins him
he looks at her for a beat then they move toward the motel
they quietly and cautiously approach one of the motel rooms
the drapes are closed
cindy stays a few feet back as matrix gun drawn slowly eases sullys motel key into the door lock then quickly opens the door
matrix gun out in front bursts into the room
no ones there
cindy nervously peeks her head into the room sees its okay joins matrix inside closes the door and locks the chain
they look around the room
sullys suitcase is spilled open on one of the beds
beer cans and fast food containers lay open and the bureau drawers are ajar
matrix goes to the suitcase and searches through it
cindy checks out the bureau drawers
matrix finds nothing in the suitcase
he looks under the bed then moves to the closet and looks inside
there is a sudden loud knocking at the front door
matrix and cindy immediately look at each other and cont
then matrix quietly moves to her
whispers urgent its cooke
let him in
matrix moves into the bathroom and turns on the shower
cindy tears the covers off the bed musses up her hair and unbuttons her blouse to show some cleavage
matrix and cindy edge up to the door and matrix flattens himself aginst the wall close to the door
he nods to cindy and she opens the door a crack so the chain is still locking the door
cooke standing outside looks through the crack at her
hes in the shower
cooke listens a beat to the running shower
cindy looks him up and down then slouches toward the crack so her breasts push at her blouse
cooke looks back through the door at her
matrix at the inside edge of the door is holding his gun ready to fire
matrix can only see cindy
open the door
cindy unlocks the chain and opens the door
move out of the way
cindy moves away from the door
matrix tenses ready to attack
cooke looks into the room at the rumpled bed suitcase and fast food containers
the shower sounds continue to echo from the bathroom
cooke cautiously enters the doorway
matrix slams the gun against the brawny cookes head
cooke crashes back against the wall but doesnt go down
he grabs matrixs gun hand by the wrist and the two of them struggle for the gun
the gun fires into the ceiling as they wrestle around the room
they break a table and crash into a chest of drawers
i cindy moves to help matrix
the gun fires again shattering the lamp near cindy making her duck for cover
cooke slowly forces the gun toward matrixs face
the barrel gets closer
then almost points right at matrix
with a sudden surge of power matrix lifts cooke off the ground pushes him toward the wall and the two of them crash right through the door into the adjoining
a twenty year old couple in bed look up in shock as matrix and cooke bounce off their bed and slam against the wall
the gun fires shattering the mirror above the young couple and they scramble to safety on the floor on the other side of the bed
matrix and cooke come off the wall and slam onto the floor the gun coming out of matrixs hand
cooke picks it up before matrix can reach it
cooke points the gun right at matrixs face pulls back the trigger then smiles
fuck you asshole
he pulls the trigger
no more bullets in the bun
the blood drains from cookes face
matrix looks at him
fuck you asshole
he blasts cooke in the jaw and cooke goes backward through the broken door and falls to the floor
matrix races back through the broken door starts toward cooke then stops cold
cooke has fallen on the broken sharp table leg and the leg goes into his back and comes out of his chest
matrix bends down to the barely alive cooke
where is she cooke
cooke looks blankly back at him
cookes eyes go cold and still
cindy approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body the stake coming out of his chest
matrix starts emptying cookes pockets
theres a wallet containing only cash
matrix tosses it to the floor
he brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes examines the lighter then tosses both objects to the floor
he pulls out two keys on a key chain
theyre car keys
matrix leaps to his feet
matrix and cindy exit from the room and go out to the parking lot
matrix looks at the six cars parked there then he breaks a key off the chain and hands it to cindy
try the trunks
they split up
matrix tries the car door key into a pontiac
it wont open
cindy goes to the trunk of a honda
it wont open
matrix races to a ford
the door wont open
cindy races to a cadillac
she opens the trunk
matrix races over to her and looks into the trunk
he uses the door key and opens the cadillacs door
matrix looks desperately around the inside of the cadillac
he opens the glove compartment and looks inside
he starts to come out of the car then suddenly stops
he sees the edge of a piece of paper protruding from the pocket along the inside of the car door
he pulls the paper out and looks at it
its an invoice from coastal fuel hermosa st
long beach california to patria enterprises redonda st
san pedro california
matrix comes out of the car with the invoice and cindy looks at it
make any sense to you
coastal is a fuel depot that supplies planes
for who the airlines
no usually smaller private aircraft
im getting my pilots license
coastal is where my instructor gets his fuel
theres a lot of warehouses around redondo street
arius must be keeping a plane there
matrix closes the car door and pockets the invoice
thirty guerilla soldiers are working in the same warehouse that arius and bennett had walked through earlier
trucks tanks jeeps bazookas machine guns mortars etc
are spread around the darkened room
matrix removes a ground level wire mesh grille from the warehouses outside wall then he crawls through and cindy replaces the grille
matrix crawls along the warehouse floor in the darkened room
he goes under a jeep then pauses to survey the room
the soldiers move weapons metal containers and wooden crates from the trucks to the jeeps
a soldiers feet walk right in front of matrix the soldier unloads a crate onto the jeep above matrix then the feet move away
matrix crawls away from the jeeps moves low through the shadows goes into a corridor and sees a door ajar
a soldier vega is looking at some charts on a table
matrix pushes open the door slightly to see into the rest of the room
as the door moves it creaks on its hinge
vega looks up from the charts and sees the door is open more then it was
he pauses then starts walking toward the door
matrix starts to move away from the door then stops
he hears footsteps and conversation approaching the other end of the corridor
vega is two feet away from the inside of the door
matrix desperately grabs the door handle and pushes the door forward
matrix slams his fist into vegas stomach then quickly moves into the room puts a choke hold around vega with his left arm then carefully closes the door with his
as soon as the door closes the footsteps and conversation pass right by the door outside in the corridor
matrix pulls vega toward the back of the room smashes his adams apple opens a closet drops the dead vega inside then closes the door
he moves to the door leading outside the warehouse opens it and cindy enters
they begin to whisper
i saw all the equipment but theres no plane
what about your daughter
matrix shakes his head
arius and bennett arent here
shes wherever they are
matrix looks at cindy in desperation for a beat then they begin to look around the room
the room is designed as the aircraft control room
there are aerial charts on the tables and the walls
there are photos of several military planes and a civilian amphibious plane
there are copies of weather reports situated around the room and there is a vhf radio
matrix notes a set of military map coordinates penciled onto the side of a chart
a scale line is drawn under the coordinates
he studies the coordinates then picks up a drafting compass and pen
he puts three dots which corresponds to the three sets of coordinates onto a coasted chart of southern california
cindy is studying the photos of the aircraft
matrix sets the width of the legs of the drafting compass then puts the point of one of the compass legs onto one of the three dots and draws a
footsteps and conversation approach the door
matrix stops drawing and freezes
cindy looks toward the door
the footsteps reach the door then continue right by it
matrix uses the compass to draw a second circle
closeup of the pen as it finishes a third circle the three circles now intersecting right over a small island miles west of los angeles
matrix looks at the island then shows the chart to cindy
somethings going on out there
cindy looks at the chart then back at the photos of the aircraft on the wall
one of these planes an amphibian
maybe theyre using it to fly there
matrix comes over and looks at the photo of the amphibian
let me see that invoice
matrix takes it out of his pocket shows it to her and she studies it
she sees gallons of type aircraft fuel
matrix and cindy glance at each other as footsteps go by outside
they continue to whisper
type four fuel is amphibian and two hundred fifty gallons is what it would take to fly that plane to the island and back
but its not here
i saw everything theyve got
cindy glances at the invoice then looks up at matrix
it was refueled at pump station thirty two pacific pier
thats san pedro
how longs it take to fly out to the island
about two hours
matrix looks at his watch
the watch reads and counting down
two soldiers roberto and juan come down the corridor they pass the room matrix is in then roberto stops
he comes back right toward matrixs door
he turns the door handle
he goes into the room
matrix and cindy are flat against the wall hiding behind the door inches from roberto
he looks around for a beat then turns and leaves the room closing the door
matrix carrying the chart and cindy move away from the warehouse and approach sullys car
are we going to the plane
she looks bewilderedly at him
where are we going
matrix and cindy are in sullys car speeding along a street
matrix is driving his face hard
cindy glances over at him
matrix and cindy slowly drive by the front of a guns and survival equipment store
it is heavily barricaded with a thick steel grille
they pass some street construction equipment steamroller caterpillar forklift flashing warning signs etc
and drive to the rear of the store
theres a heavy concrete wall with no windows
how do you get in
matrix jerks the car into reverse and races the car backwards around another building until the car is o
the camera is in the store shooting out through the steel grille
we hear a rumbling noise and then we see it
matrix is atop a steamroller that is rolling right at the steamroller crashes into the front of the store and the glass shatters inward and the steel grille buckles and
cracks apart under the roller
matrix jumps off the steamroller as the alarm starts to he takes a shopping cart like in safeway and starts working the aisles
along the first aisle he grabs a snorkel mask and flippers and tosses them into the cart then grabs a deflated and compressed rubber raft and paddle and tosses them
he takes the cart and shoves it down the aisle the cart coming to a rolling crash among the debris at the front of the store
cindy takes the cart and quickly rolls it out of the store
matrix moves to the next aisle takes another shopping cart and moves down the aisle
he grabs o
fatigue pants an assault extraction survival vest a camouflage sweater black survival boots and combat knives
he gives the cart a shove and it rolls crazily down the aisle into the debris
cindy quickly rolls the cart outside
matrix moves to the counter and starts feverisl rly moving his hands along the underside looking for something
come on come on
he suddenly feels the hidden button and presses it
behind him a wall containing innocuous sporting equipment slides to the side revealing a hidden room
matrix pushes a cart into the room
the store alarm continues to clang
this room is loaded with every kind of illegal weapon imaginable
its an awesome sight
matrix garbs an israeli desert eagle monster automatic handgun a mm
submachine gun a gauge assault shotgun with folding stock a steyr assault rifle a law rocket launcher grenades dynamite and fuse bandoliers with ammo and loads everything into the cart
he wheels the cart out of the hidden room moves down the aisle with it then carefully pushes it so it rolls by itself the rest of the way to
get the car
cindy catches the cart glances inside and her she wheels the cart away
matrix reenters the hidden room sees if hes missing anything is satisfied and leaves the room
matrix passes by the counter and suddenly a cop comes out from behind the aisle with his shotgun pointed right at matrixs head
he cocks the trigger
matrix quickly looks toward the other direction to flee
a second cop is at the end of the other aisle with his shotgun also pointed at matrixs head
he cocks the trigger
the police paddy wagon drives through the night
matrix is standing in the back of the paddy wagon his face up against the small wire mesh window that leads to the front seat where the two cops that
arrested him daryl and fred are sitting
if youll call kirby hell tell you
daryl looks over at fred and rolls his eyes
fred whos driving smiles
matrix gives up leans exhaustedly against the paddy wagon wall and looks at his watch
the watch reads and counting
matrix looks hopelessly at his watch
the paddy wagon pulls up to a red light
to the side cindy enters the frame and drives the car up next to the wagon
the two cops glance over at her
cindy smiles and winks at them
daryl glances over at fred
hooker not bad
the light turns green and fred drives the wagon through the light
the wagon pulls ahead and daryl looks into the outside right rearview mirror
her car remains stationary at the light
she is standing next to the car waving to daryl
daryl looks over at fred
i think she wants to give us something
daryl looks back toward the rearview mirror
a close shot of cindy shows her now with the law rocket launcher on her shoulder pointed at the paddy wagon
she pulls the trigger
a rocket shoots out of the rear of the launcher and completely destroys a bus stop kiosk
daryl is staring incredulously into the rearview mirror
matrix listening to the continuing explosion reacts
cindy now has the launcher pointed correctly and fires at the back tires of the wagon
the road underneath the back of the wagon explodes and the back of the wagon is knocked upwards and the wagon crashes to its side and skids along the road
the wagon slows and stops the smoke clears and we see a giant hole along the back and bottom of the wagon
matrix dazedly exits from the wagon cindy screeches up in the car matrix dives in the back and she races away
daryl and fred dazed but unhurt are trying to get out of the wagon
cindy and matrix are speeding off into the night
whered you learn to do that
two heavily armed guards patrol the perimeter wall of arius estate
arius and bennett are in the living room surrounded by ten guerrillas
they are looking at a map of val verde
the border of the country has arrows drawn at different areas showing where the guerrillas will enter the country
how soon does matrix arrive in val verde
bennett glances at his watch
just over two hours
let me know as soon as he lands
you think hes going to give us any problems
hell do anything we tell him as long as he thinks hell get his daughter back
i wonder if he knows hes never going to get her back
arius and bennett look at each other
jenny moves to the door of her darkened room and tries the door handle
its tightly locked
she moves to a window and pulls at the boards over it
they dont move
she sits back down on the floor and begins to shiver
cindy and matrix are in the car driving near the water in san pedro
cindy is at the wheel matrix in the passenger seat
cindy approaches a red light
she drives through the light takes a sharp left and begins driving on a street along the water
a police car light flashing turns onto the street up ahead and begins racing directly toward them
cindy glances at matrix hes watching the police car
the police car gets closer and closer to them as they continue to watch then the police speed right past them and fade away behind them
cindy exhales her breath and glances at matrix
he watches as the police disappear then he turns and stares straight ahead
tight on an old beat up grauman goose seaplane then we pull back to reveal cindy and matrix parked near it
they are at a deserted pier in san pedro
matrix looks at a lighted shack nearby
a guerrilla guard is in the small shack reading an aircraft manual
his feet are on the edge of the desk and he casually pushes his chair to tilt backwards
matrix silently enters the shack and looks around
the guards back is to matrix
the guard is tilting his chair back and forth matrix is standing right behind him
the guard tilts his chair backward matrix circles his forearm around the mans neck and slams him backward out of frame to the floor
with his left hand matrix takes a ring of keys off of the wall
cindy the inflatable raft at her feet is waiting at the plane as matrix carrying two duffel bags of equipment approaches her
she takes the key ring from him opens the door of the plane and matrix begins to load the duffel bags inside
cindy sits in the pilots seat and stares at the controls as matrix gets in the passenger seat
this isnt a plane
its a canoe with wings
she plays with some controls and an engine starts to turn over
she tries the other engine
it coughs and dies
she tries the engine again
it starts to turn over then coughs and dies again
come on you piece of shit
he slams his hand onto the control panel
the engine starts up
works every time
cindy revs the engines and starts to move the plane
a second guerrilla guard is racing his jeep toward the plane
he fires with a pistol
bullets blast holes into the side of the plane
bullets smash into the cockpit near matrix and cindy
matrix lifts his submachine gun and fires it
boom the guard gets bullets blasting into his chest the jeep goes out of control and the jeep and guard go off the dock and crash into the water
cindy is racing the amphibian across the water
they get closer
closer to a group of boats moored in the water
just before they crash into them cindy pulls the seaplane up
the pontoons on the seaplane just clear the masts on the boats
matrix looking shaken for the first time glances over at cindy
you know what youre doing
matrix swallows a little bit then turns to look out the window
theyre on their way
police cars with flashing lights surround the front of the guns and survival equipment store
police officers look at the steamroller and the smashed front of the store
general kirby moves away from the police and approaches a noncom driver waiting by a government sedan
call the federal building
have them monitor every police aviation and marine channel in the area
what are you expecting
world war iii
cindy and matrix are in the cockpit the light frog the control panel softly spilling onto their faces
the sound is the drone of the engines
whyd you decide to get a pilots license
my father was an air force pilot
thats why i becarle a stewardess
but after a while i got tired of serving food and drinks
i wanted to fly the plane myself
i guess what ive really wanted all along was to be just like h r
she looks at ma
suddenly the rad c crackle

this is the coast guard cutter mcrgenthal

this is a restricted area
they shoot the shit out of this area all the time
the flights out of lax avoid it like the plague
can you get under the radar
not marine radar but if we get close enough to the water the high seas effect might camouflage us
cindy dives the seaplane downward
cindy continues to pilot the seaplane just above the water
she reaches down to the back of her knee feels it and grimaces
matrix leans over moves her hand and looks at what caused her to crimace
a nasty looking cut is starting to bleed
whend you get that
he reaches into one of his duffel bags and pulls out bandages and gauze
the car crash
matrix wipes her cut and puts the banda e dressinc over that reminds me of what im buying you as soon as we get back
she expertly wraps the gauze around her leg and ties it
a new car
with a cassette deck
with a cassette deck
cindy watching the fireballs and smoke in the distance picks up her radio mike
coast guard this is whiskey xray four four eight
emergency priority message for general frederick kirby
say again commando
code red at degrees nine minutes north degrees minutes west
cindy lowers the mike and hits the the throttle moving the seaplane along the coast closer to the bathe three guerrillas jump into a jeep to get to the matrix
lying hidden nearby pulls a pin on a grenade and begins to count the guerrillas start to pull away in the jeep as matrixs grenade suddenly lands in the back of the jeep
the jeep explodes twelve guerrillas climb into the back of a transport truck and the truck a uic
ly gets underway
matrix runs in front of a pair of large gates that lead to the estate
qwduction note these gates are at palos verde drive matrix quickly studies the gates
in the rear rkina area near the k
tc en n m ix goes u sone y ouutsice sazec then climbs onto the c
the rose garden is a long re a ncle with runerou s self containe multi eha e th c c hedoes i
the die of the garden
arius is behind a hedge at one end or the garden and matrix is behind a hedge abo t sixty f eet away at the other end of the garden
there is al sc a labyrinth of hedges between the two men
matrix watches the bullets blast throa
ch the hecce near him
he crawls to the side the
rises up an fires the automatic handgun at the he ce where he saw arius
boom boom boom boom
arius watches the bullets blast throuc the hedge near him
he starts crawling to the size and then crawls following the hedge towar matrix
he and matrix are like cat and mouse
matrix is crawling following a hedge toward arius
he cares up to the dear guerrilla with the flame thr wer that matrix k
iled in the rose garden earlier then matrix crawls around him
arius peers over the to of a hedge
he sees what looks l iue movement in a hedge
ar i is s arms rises fires his submachine gun at the movement then quickly lowers himself to the g
rc he hears somerr m lines
they are dying sounds
arius cautiously rises gun pointed at the hedge he shot at
the hits arius and he screams
he runs a lave some light bushes umps to the pat c below then falls down about eight feet away from a fountain and pool of water
he crawls slowly toward the water stretches his hand out then
burns to death his outstretched hand only six inches away from the fountain
with the automatic handgun in his hand matrix enters the estate
he moves silently through the garden room looking at the dead bodies lying around the courtyard and front hall
he cautiously edges along the dining room
he enters the kitchen then stops cold
he looks at whats facing him
bennett holding jenny has the switchblade pressed against her throat
matrix points his handgun right at bennett
bennett pulls jenny close against his chest and face shielding himself
matrix hesitates then lowers his gun
jenny struggles in bennetts grip
crazed to matrix matrix doesnt move
bennett grabs jennys hair and pulls her head back exposing her throat even more
he presses the tip of the sharp stiletto against her adams apple
matrix hesitates a short beat then he moves back toward the dining room
matrix comes back into the dining room leans against a wall then puts his hand down to his wound
the red spotch is larger and wetter than before
bennett with jenny draped over his neck and shoulders like a towel races out of the front of the estate toward a jeep parked in the front parking area
note the rear parking area could also be used
matrix hears sounds of a jeep starting outside and he races into the front hall
matrix races outside into the front parking area and sees bennett driving jenny away in the jeep
matrix races into the parking area after them
production note the secens from here on are to be shot in palos verdes
matrix races through the gates he blew up earlier passes the shell of the blown up transport truck leaves the road and runs over grassy knolls and sand dunes
up ahead in the distance bennett races the jeep toward the dock
matrixs wound is bleeding badly and he begins to struggle to run for the first time
bennett now dragging jenny along has left the jeep and is running along the dock
they stop at arius war boat bennett cuts the moorings with his knife then he forces jenny into the boat
matrix nears the dock as bennett tries to start the engines
the engines start to kick over then stop
matrix races onto the foot of the dock
bennett desperately tries the engines again
matrix races toward the end of the dock
bennett edges the war boat away from the dock then blasts the engines and races the boat away
just as matrix reaches the end of the dock
matrix watches the boat race away with jenny
matrix has lost her
bennetts got her
suddenly he hears a noise and he looks to the side
cindy is racing her seaplane toward the dock
cindy slows the seaplane as she passes the dock and matrix grabs onto a ladder
with matrix hanging onto the ladder cindy blasts the throttle and races after bennetts boat
as the seaplane starts to go faster matrix holds onto the ladder and looks at bennetts boat up ahead
bennetts boat is about forty yards ahead of the seaplane
cindy pushes the throttle faster
she watches as the seaplane starts to slowly overtake the boat
the seaplane is skimming and skipping over the water
the wind and spray slap against matrix as he watches the seaplane closing the gap on the boat
he climbs from the ladder onto the wing of the plane the propellers only about five feet away from him
he crawls along the wing of the plane the wind whipping at him
cindy glances out toward matrix on the wing then she grips the controls firmly to try to lessen the planes bouncing
the seaplane closes to about fifteen yards from the boat
bennett looks behind him and sees the seaplane coming trying to steer with one hand bennett turns toward the seaplane as the boat bounces and fires wildly at matrix on
the bullets whistle by matrix
he continues crawling along the wing until he reaches the very end
he pulls his gun from his holster and aims it toward the boat
matrix tries to aim the gun through the sight but the bouncing of the seaplane the bouncing of the boat and jennys nearness to bennett makes a shot too risky
matrix lowers his gun
cindy pushes the throttle even faster
the seaplane starts to pull even with bennetts boat
bennett looks to the side and sees cindy in the cockpit almost even with him
starting to panic he fires wildly as he tries to steer the bouncing boat
a buttet blasts into the seaplane body and a second bullet blasts into just underneath the cockpit side window
the third bullet shatters the cockpit window and explodes into the cockpit near cindys head
cindy doesnt flinch a bit and edges the seaplane ahead of the boat
cindy has positioned the seaplane so that the wing matrix is on is directly over the boat
bennett sees the underside of the wing above and fires into the bottom of it hoping to hit matrix
bullet holes rip through the wing inches from matrixs head
matrix dives off the wing right into the boat directly on top of bennett
they crash into jenny and hit the floor of the boat
matrix grabs bennetts gun hand and they wrestle for the gun
a shot blasts into the fuel tank at the stern of the boat
theres a small explosion and the rear of the boat erupts in flames
jenny dives toward the front of the boat for cover
the steering wheel unattended shifts wildly back and forth
the boat is bouncing crazily toward a deserted rocky beach
a large sign on the beach reads danger u
coast cindy in the seaplane watches as both the seaplane and burning boat speed right toward the increasingly looming beach up ahead
at the last minute cindy swerves the seaplane to the right away from the beach
the burning boat continues to race directly at the matrix savagely twists bennetts wrist hand that holds the gun
he drops the gun on the floor of the boat
the boat is just about to hit the beach
matrix smashes bennetts face with his fist knocking him down onto the floor near jenny
the burning boat narrowly misses the rocks and slams bennett and jenny are thrown across the floor and slam into the inside wall of the boat
matrix standing is thrown out of the boat flies through the air and slams into a spongy patch of sand
a captain on the bridge of a coast guard patrol ship looks toward the ships large guns
commence target practice
the guns begin to fire their salvos
matrix groggily gathers himself on the sand
he hears the sounds of incoming rounds and boom
artillery shells explode on the beach
bennett grabs jenny and hustles her out of the boat hiding behind the front outside hull of the boat
matrix runs to the opposite side of the boat and crouches down on the sand then draws his automatic handgun from its holster
some more artillery shells explode kicking up sand not too far away
bennett his knife against jenny is on one side of the boat
matrix holding his gun is on the other side of the boat
this doesnt involve her bennett
its just between you
an artillery shell explodes near bennett and jenny
a closeup of bennett shows him reacting disorientedly to the sound smoke and flash of the explosion
bennett and matrix have their faces pressed to the dirt as a mortar shell explodes near their heads
bennett gets up wildly looks around then maniacally fires his submachine gun killing three young children running scared across a val verde field
matrix rises and smashes his rifle butt into bennetts face
bennetts crazed mind returns to the present
let her go bennett and ill give you a chance to twist that knife into me
the stern of the boat continues to burn as bennett considers what matrix said
just what i thought bennett youre still a yellow chicken shit
bennetts eyes fill with hate
more shells explode nearby
throw the gun away matrix
matrix tosses the gun away down the beach
bennett violently pushes jenny into the wet sand along the edge of the water
matrix takes his knife out of his wrist sheath and meets bennett on the sand in front of the boat
matrix and bennett begin to circle each other
he feints the knife toward matrix
and so is she
jenny watches the fight in horror
bennett jabs with his knife and slashes matrix causing a bloody cut
bennett jabs again
this time matrix parries the jab and slashes bennett causing a bloody cut on him
they circle each other again feinting jabs at each other
two more shells explode and kick up sand nearby
a lieutenant pilots a copter as general kirby sitting next to him speaks into a radio mike
they are flying along the coast of the island another army helicopter behind them
they hear the sounds of the explosions
stop that shelling now
bennets stabs at matrix and matrix grabs his wrist
with his free hand matrix stabs at bennett and bennett grabs matrixs wrist
they are locked hand in hand staring death into each others eyes
jenny watching the fight notices matrixs gun on the beach near her and hesitates to pick it up
suddenly matrix falls backward to the ground pulling bennett with him and flips bennett over him hard to the sand
matrix jumps up quickly to finish bennett
bennett quickly throws sand in matrixs eyes
matrix blinded stumbles badly
bennett immediately grabs matrixs knife hand around the wrist then sinks his own knife into matrixs side
matrixs eyes go glassy then he drops his knife
bennett lets matrixs wrist go looks at matrixs glassy eyes for a beat then he pulls his knife out of matrixs side
matrix staggers for a beat then stumbles a few steps and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of the boat
bennett slowly approaches matrix from behind casually feeling the blade of his knife
he looks at matrixs wide unprotected back and bennett smiles
bennett pulls the knife back with his arm preparing to plunge it into matrixs back
out of bennetts sight matrix slips the knife out of his boot and grips the knife
fuck you asshole
he plunges the knife down toward matrixs back
matrix moves like lightning to the side
the knife misses him and gets stuck in the hull of the boat
matrix turns toward bennett
shaking his head no
bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from the boat hull but he cant
fear floods his eyes
matrix moves close to bennett
fuck you asshole
he drives his knife into bennetts throat so hard the knife goes through bennetts neck and comes out the other side
still holding the knife matrix then drives the knife into the hull of the boat
the knife sticks into the hull holding bennetts neck there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board
suddenly there is another larger explosion in the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat explodes into flames leaving bennett lost in the fireball
matrix limps away from the flames jenny rushes into his arms and he holds her close
she shows him she was holding his gun
i wanted to shoot
but i couldnt i just couldnt
matrix looks at her
you know something
im glad you couldnt
he takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning boat into the ocean
he sees two army helicopters approaching from the air and cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach
matrix lies down his head in jennys lap and tries to still his bleeding
the two copters land
kirby gets out of one and two medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other
the corpsmen bring the stretcher to matrix and gently ease him onto it
they start to carry him as jenny walks alongside
i just saw whats left of arius estate
youre the best ive ever known john
ive saved a place for you if you want to join up with me again
matrix notices as cindy joins jenny standing next to him
matrix looks at the two of them then up at kirby
this was the last one
the corpsmen carry matrix into the copter and jenny joins him inside
kirby and cindy watch him from outside the chopper
what about your identities
dont you need two more
matrix looks at cindy
two might not be enough
the chopper wings have started and the chopper is preparing to liftoff
matrix and cindy are looking at each other
the chopper starts to liftoff
cindy suddenly runs to the chopper and jumps in the door as it lifts off
matrix puts his arm around her then he looks back toward kirby
matrix holds up three fingers and smiles
kirby waves good bye as the chopper rises high above the beach and flies out over the ocean
