william wordsworth the theory of black holes was developed before there was any indication from observations that they actually existed
i do not know of any other example in science where such a great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis of thought
it shows the remarkable power and depth of einsteins theory
there is still much we dont know such as what happens to objects and information that fall into a black hole
do the reemerge elsewhere in the universe or in another universe
and can we warp space and time so much that one can travel back in time
maybe someone will come back from the future and tell us
stephen hawking the legend reads october th darkness
headlights bounce off thick sheets of rain
gallon esso oil truck barrels over wet studded pavement heading towards manhattan
its going fast
at the base of the bridge a large reflective sign lit up by arc lights men at work
there are two work crews several hundred feet apart
the first crew is con ed
a corrugated vacuum tube feeds into an open manhole
a worker drops into the hole
the second crew is construction
theyre at the apron of the bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed
its late and the men are tired
a mistake is made
a fork lift loaded with lumber fails to negotiate a turn
whacks into an abutment
spilling its load onto the roadway
bad timing because right now that esso oil truck hits the off ramp
not a lot of time for the driver to react to a roadway spewed with lumber
he does his best
slams the brakes spins the wheel hits the horn but it doesnt matter wheels skid across the blacktop spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber lifting off the slick pavement
hemorrhaging oil from its ruptured tanks
grinding its way towards
men at work
seconds to react as an pound juggernaut of death plows through parked cars like paper
crushing the con ed equipment
lurching to a halt on top of the manhole
two fire trucks gallon pumper and mack tiller ladder pull into the street
sirens wail cherry tops spin
frank sullivan is strapped into an open air jumper seat
a real life hard charger frank is the kind of irons man fire fighters want coming in after them should they get caught in harms way
kind hearted and hard fisted he has the grace and courage of a man living by his convictions
across from frank sits graham gibson
a good looking african american gib is a fire fighter fourth grade a tank man
and one nervous probie
through a window into the cab we see lt
butch foster on a walkie talkie
a beefy old pro whos been through more fires than he can remember
a walkie talkie sits in a cradle between frank and gibson
through walkie talkie oil all over the street
cracked water and gas mains
four companies coming in
butchs voice continues as frank calmly absorbs the information while at the same time
re rain oh man
hope it aint like this in baltimore tomorrow
the game graham
gibson taps his wristwatch
my watch is busted
just stay with me
this is what we do
still tapping his watch i seem nervous huh
gibson grins relaxes a bit
frank checks his rolex divers watch
multiple sirens fill the dawn
through walkie talkie two con ed men trapped in an underground electrical conductor vault
franks eyes harden
his game face sets up
a tableau of impending danger
thick black oil bleeds from teh truck onto the street
pouring underneath the rig
and into the manhole
police urgently cordon off the area evacuating the workers
emergency personnel deal with the badly injured truck driver
firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the three quarters covered manhole trying to divert the oil away from the underground vault
fire commander oconnell yells at his men to finish the job and get the hell away
the big trucks arrive
pumper engine and franks ladder truck rapidly guided into position by men on the ground
frank gibson butch and the rest of the unit are on the ground instantly and ready for orders
they are looking at a nightmare ready to happen
frank takes in everything
fire commander oconnell and a con ed supervisor approach
deep irony a fun one
we got high voltage cables ripped loose in the underground
they hit water that faults gonna arc
frank looks at the tanker over the manhole
there is now nobody around it
why havent they killed the juice
switches are shorted out
youre shitting me
wish i was
oldest part of the system down there
were on it but its gonna take awhile
we gotta go underground
get those guys out now
bulkhead doors rusted shut
the block is being evacuated
i dont want anybody
including our boys
within fifty yards of that tanker
its a fucking bomb
frank has been staring at the capsized rig
butch knows what hes thinking
but its too late
frank is gone
slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the tanker
he kneels over the three quarters covered manhole using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below
sparks from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault
this is the fire department
you guys okay
please man you gotta get us out of here
thats exactly what were gonna do
and frank is up heading for his truck signaling gibson
yells to con ed supervisor how do we get to the vault door
theres a manhole at canal and bowery
forget it frank
no way you reach those men in time
frank grabs a halaghan claw tool and a walkie talkie
gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights
and they are off and running
yelling back i can do it butch
me and my tank man here
to all and into walkie start spraying down the street
let me know when we are fully evacuated
frank uses the adz to rip open the heavy manhole cover
frank and gibson descend into the tunnel strap lights on their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness
they race down the subterranean passage
the stench is thick
butchs voice suddenly booms out of the walkie talkie via walkie frank you hear me
into walkie yeah butch
via walkie the gas level is getting serious
the undergrounds combustible it could flashover
i want you to abort
get the hell out of there
frank picks up the pace
guys got balls
into walkie frank
we gotta go back
calling back to him stay with me gib
were gonna do this
charging after him i shoulda been a fucking mailman
frank reaches the rusted submarine like vault door
pounds on the door
a faint response
he goes to work on it with the halaghan tool
frank gives him a wink and a smile
its gonna be okay
via walkie frank where are you
frank digs down suddenly the door gives way oil and water rush from the vault pouring over frank and gibson foaming into the tunnel
but the door is mounted three feet off the ground
there is still three feet of oil and water trapped inside
and the smell of gas is now overwhelming
into walkie were in butch
frank probes the dark vault with the flashlight blade
through smoke we see two men huddled in the corner trapped by three loose hot cables whipping around the tiny vault like an electric hydra
con ed worker shivers ankle broken leaning on older con ed worker
time to go home fellas
gibson sprays the room clearing out most of the smoke
frank steps into the vault
if the hot end of those cables hits you itll conduct to the water and were all fired
frank drops to his knees ducking under the cables shuffles to center of the vault
places his hands at opposite ends of the halaghan tool hoping for the cables to pass directly over his head
a hairy beat then
frank jackknifes out of the water ramming the halaghan into the ceiling
the teeth on the claw end and the spike on the adz end are embedded into the concrete stapling the cables to the ceiling
make that balls of steel
everybody move it
gibson and con ed worker help injured worker out of the vault
frank checks to make sure theyve cleared the vault and lets go of the tool
frank jumps into the tunnel hoists the injured worker over his back and races back down the tunnel
to gibson haul ass that claw aint gonna hold for long
into walkie take cover shes gonna flash
oconnell and the few remaining cops firemen run for it
frank gibson and the con ed men scramble towards the manhole
butch and another fireman are waiting up top
they help the men who are covered in oil and slime up onto the street
and then they all tear away from the manhole
around a corner
collapsing on the pavement against a building
the vault ignites the tunnel flashbacks a towering geyser of flames and dirt erupting out of the manhole from which frank has just escaped
in the distance flames erupt out of the other manhole
engulfing the oil truck
blowing it into a million pieces
through the inferno at the base of the manhattan bridge frank can see that no one is hurt
his eyes glistening with adrenaline and relief he sits back against the building and throws an arm around gibson
you did good gib
frank looks over at the hyperventilating butch and smiles
elvis has left the building
inside the tunnel
flashes of light bounce off the shiny tile walls
the deep throated roar of a harley battles with martha the vandellas heat wave
we are with frank wearing a leather jacket with the insignia of his fire fighting unit emblazoned on it and a new york mets baseball cap pulled down tight as
he rockets his chopper through traffic out of the tunnel and up into
credit montage begins as frank cruises home
it has stopped raining
frank passes by billboards and other evidence of the approaching mets baltimore orioles world series
he circles a little league ball field waving to some frank glides the harley alongside his house
a feisty dalmatian puppy elvis barks his welcome from behind a fence
feeling fatigued frank dismounts and enters teh backyard playing for a moment with elvis while he uprights a training bicycle tidies up baseball equipment and glances up at a ham
radio antenna secured to the roof before entering through a backdoor
there is a sense of routine to all this
the kitchen is empty
breakfast dishes in the sink
frank flips on the radio
it plays out under the rest of the montage as coverage of the oil truck crash blends into other news stories
a note on the refrigerator reads
im off to work
johnnys at school
elvis is fed
i luvs you
setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table frank glances at the daily news
but his eyes are tired he stares off into space
a radio in the bedroom is tuned to sports news
frank soaks in a hot bath
he looks like he might fall asleep and does
a softball blows through the window from the backyard landing on the rug next to the bed
frank bolts awake staring at the busted window
he checks the clock
he steps to the broken window
several small boys scurry from the yard
two others johnny sullivan and gordo hersch both stand frozen in place
elvis tears in circles around them
all is very quiet
then from somewhere beyond the bedroom door we hear the beatles back in the the ussr
julia sullivan is rockin out chopping vegetables
singing to song show me round the smokey mountains way down south
adorable sweet and strong
strawberry blonde hair sapphire eyes soft earthy vibe
frank wearing fdny sweats moves into the kitchen flipping the softball from hand to hand
julia turns to him and rolls her eyes at the sight of the ball
say no more
without breaking stride he gives her a smack on the lips and steps to the screen door to the back porch
johnny stands nervously outside the door
elvis sits at his side
gordo watches from the safety of his own porch next door
frank opens the screen door casts a stern look down at his son
looks like two weeks worth of allowance chief
glad to hear that
and frank drops the softball into johnnys mitt closes the screen door and turns back into the kitchen
johnny turns away into the yard
with a shrug and sharing a kids will be kids smile with julia he grabs a cold rheingold from the refrigerator and heads into
past a console television to the hi fi calling to julia how about a little of the king
from kitchen well why not a little of the king
julia crosses her eyes as if she could stop him
frank moves to change records
suddenly a pan of spaghetti sauce bubbles over
i think i ruined the sauce
as elvis suspicious minds plays frank steps back in moves up behind julia and takes her in his arms
whats the matter jules
trouble workin an eight hour shift watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese
you didnt marry donna reed
id go with you and chinese take out over her any time
and he turns her around and they start to dance as frank sings along to elvis badly
singing lyrics caught in a trap i cant walk out because i love you too much b b baby
we follow the music as it drifts out into the yard where we can see johnny and gordo looking in at the weirdness
how was your tour
frank spots johnny and gordo staring at them
he winks at the boys and swings julia into a fred astaire dip
loaded butch called
it was under control bud
butchys just getting tight in his old age
nothing wrong with old age frank
long as you get there
with a laugh frank drops julia into another dip
as the music fades we
close on bicycle training wheels lying on the sidewalk
johnny is precariously perched on his fire engine red bicycle
he wears a police badge and a whistle around his neck
frank stands beside him holding on to the bike seat
were on a quiet side street next to house
its the last light of the day
hold on johnnys eyes
okay start pedaling
daddy put the wheels back on
im gonna fall
dont think about falling just keep pedaling
daddy im scared
cmon chief show some guts
johnny takes a gulp of air doesnt want to disappoint his father nods okay
he starts pedaling
slowly moving forward
frank holds on to the seat
franks still hanging on jogging along side
im gonna let go
frank lets go
johnnys pumping those little six year old legs but he starts to wobble out of control crash
johnny starts to cry quickly gets up and runs back to the house
julia comes out of the kitchen door
johnny runs into her arms
dont quit on me now chief
johnny tears himself from julias arms runs inside
frustrated frank lights up another cigarette
dont be so tough on him frank hes six years old
softer he just needs to know youre right there behind him
frank takes a deep drag on the butt
steps onto the yard and stares up at the starry night
johnnys pov frank standing in the yard wishing on a star
johnny looks up at the sky and makes a wish of his own
countless points of light blaze across vast blackness
a luminous blue sphere floats peacefully below earth
we are miles away in geosynchronous orbit
multi billion dollar piece of hardware drifts into and fills the frame s communication satellite nasa hughes logos affixed to the glistening aluminum hull
all is still for some moments
but then a sound disturbs the quiet of the cosmos
its coming from the horizon
from something that looks like a hole in the fabric of space
bright streaks of starlight swirl around into that hole
and slowly the satellite begins drifting towards it pulled in by some invisible force
we look through the ripple of warped space time
as if holding a lens to one eye we glimpse two earths at once two identical north americas
the two earths turn slightly
through the screen door we are close on a mans face staring out
johns eyes tell us he needs more than just a shave and a good nights sleep
this man has demons
right now he is looking out at samantha taylor
dark blonde hair piercing blue eyes
she jams a suitcase into the back seat of her car and starts back for the house
so thats it sam
youre just walking out
samantha strides in past john towards a washer dryer
ive been walking out for the last six months
you didnt notice
she grabs clothes from teh dryer and exits to
towards a stairway beyond john not far behind
fine go ahead and save the whole world sam
sipping his beer you dont gotta worry about me
but you wouldnt help me
samantha steps into the bedroom to an open suitcase and travel bag
she starts jamming the clean clothes into the suitcase and then begins to close the case and bag
we shouldve quit a long time ago
sam cant hold back anymore she cries openly
its not your fault
i cant change
wish i could sam
but i cant
and suddenly samanthas tears turn to anger
thats not true and you know it
john has no reply
all he can do is watch as she takes her stuff and heads for the door
john stands immobilized in the middle of the room
he looks down and spots a teddy bear half stuck under a reading chair
and then to a photo of him and sam at a carnival shooting gallery
sams holding the teddy bear
john turns at the sound of the backdoor slamming
looks out a window down to samantha getting in her car and driving away
john enters goes straight for a half empty bottle of bushmills irish whiskey
as he brings the bottle to his mouth
swigging bushmills as he steps to a combination portable phone answering machine john takes off his jacket
we notice two things an napped detective shield and a
john grabs the phone
it dont matter lady
cause i dont got no friends or family
slams down the phone
and stares around the room
weve been in this house before years ago
this was frank and julia sullivans house
time has not been good to it
furnishings havent changed much but the house is missing the warmth it had when a family filled it with love
johns eyes dart to a photograph next to the desk
it is a picture of the sullivan family from back then
too many memories
he grabs his coat heads out
the field is empty
covered in shadows
john sits alone on the top row of the bleachers cradling his bottle of bushmills
he takes a long pull
as he stares down at the empty field his eyes slowly drift over to home plate
audio flashback a voice rises up out of the darkness
the voice of memory
we hear the sounds of cheering parents
the clapping whistling shouting is hauntingly juxtaposed against the empty playing field and bleachers we see on the screen
crack sound of the bat solidly connecting with the ball
camera follows invisible runner from home to first base
sullivans safe at first
batting for johnnys father is
john takes a deep breath glances from first base back to home plate
then looks off into the distance a cold thousand yard stare
john shuffles up the pathway
the sound of a tv x files filters out from inside the house
john walks in the front door
carrying an overstuffed blt whizzes by
hi uncle john
john notices smoke filtering out of his kitchen
im not your uncle kid
yelling into kitchen gordo what are you doing here
is that you
follow john into the kitchen
meet gordon hersch computer geek lovable dough boy
last seen by us in as a six year old
my cables out again
what the hell is that smell
john glances at a mound of burnt bacon dripping on the stove
can you believe ellen still wont let me cook in the house
i melt one lousy frying pan yknow
scoots into the kitchen
john guess what
dads taking me fishing
wish i could gordy
but you bring me back a big one
hey ok if gordy uses your old gear
i think its somewhere in the closet
if you can find it
sounds of him rummaging through hall closet
so yahoo went up another two points
man did we miss the boat on that one
john puts the bushmills bottle down and grabs two molsons
coulda woulda shoulda pal
john laughs hands gordo a beer and lights up a cigarette
sam called ellen
nothing else needs to be said
a beat then
why dont you come with us
three days of fresh air and barbecue would do you some good man
dad john cmere
sticks out of the closet attempting to drag out a large black steamer trunk stenciled with yellow letters
hey gordy what ya doing
dad check it out
can i open it up
john thinks about it for a second
noting the curious glee in little gordys face nods ok
pops open the latches opens the trunk
gordo crouches down beside his son checks out the dusty contents
hold on johns reaction to what gordy jr
finds in the trunk
reaches in and takes out fdny helmet jackets
briefly puts on the enormous helmet then sets it aside
reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled pieces of a gauge shotgun
gordo takes the shotgun from the boy and places it gingerly inside the closet
simultaneously gordy jr
hands off a leather bound scrapbook to john
before john can react gordy jr
lifts up an whats this dad
powerful memories fill his face
john thats your dads old ham radio
remember how we used to beg him to let us talk on that thing
the transceiver and microphone mint condition yaesu ft and a silver eagle astatic d microphone
this is not a toy
can we try it dad can we try it
gordo looks at john
what the hell
glass doors separate the study from the family room
the ham radio is set on a dusty wooden desk
scotch taped to the top of the radio is a diagram for the radio setup and qsl cards certificates from around the world acknowledging contact with wb yxb frank sullivan
gordo hooks up the radio
shuts off the tv
so this was what people used before the net huh
man do i feel old
gordo turns the radio on
shows gordy how it works
gordy rotates the tuning dial nothing but dead bands
its junk kid
nobody uses those things anymore
front door opens
johns head turning around
meet ellen gordos wife
the grown up in the family
gordo do you know what time it is
a beat hi john
ellen notices johns weary look but says nothing
we get the sense she knows what is wrong
cmon gordy lets go
gordo and family pour into the yard between the two houses
john shuffles out behind them
gordo and gordy jr
quickly disappear into their house but ellen lingers for a moment looking back at john standing alone
you all right john
ellen holds her glance for a moment
john smiles thinly masking his sadness
ellen nods okay and she is gone
john looks up at the stars then down to the ham radio antenna on his roof now looking raggedy from years of neglect
tv larry king is interviewing stephen hawking
john is back on the bushmills
he races clumsily for the cordless phone
close on speed dial buttons
answering machine voice hi this is julia
please leave a message after the tone
hey ma its me
probably at work
anyways ill see you tomorrow night
john puts down the phone
stares at the fdny trunk
he stumbles to it
sits down and opens it up
its filled with his dads stuff
he picks up and leafs through the old scrapbook photos and clippings illustrate family history
a quick glimpse of dads high school baseball team mom and dads s wedding
john at his first communion pictured with his mother we a folded newspaper drops out
john picks it up
front page of the daily news
top half reads october
amazins take game series even
the lower half reads he shoves the paper back in the scrapbook
puts the album down he cant deal with those wounds
he glances up at the is this anomaly connected to the space storm and the nasa satellite that disappeared in
we dont know
but given the similarities of their location and appearance this is a question that merits further investigation
note larry kings show plays for the duration of this scene
john settles in takes off his work shirt
underneath he has on a t shirt
we notice a nicotine patch on his arm
doesnt stop him from burning another marlboro
over radio cq here is wb yxb by for call
john gets up bushmill bottle in hand and stumbles into
cq come in
approaching the desk john sits down at the radio
reaches out to the mic presses down on the red squawk bar
wb ykxb whove i got
slightly slurred names john
in the background of franks voice we barely hear walter cronkite interviewing someone
are you licensed to broadcast buddy
look i dont really remember how this thing works
listen you cant broadcast without a license
unless this is an emergency you gotta get off the band
chuckling pal my whole lifes an emergency
where are you transmitting from
queens new york
whatta ya know
bayside born and raised
i thought these things were for talkin around the world
band closes down at night
during the day you can chew the band with china if you want
i cant believe people are still using these things
as john releases the squawk bar the distant sound of franks tv filters out of the ham
can you hold on a second
and then john hears the sound of a door closing
sorry bout that
so queens you psyched for the series
taking a swig i dont really follow baseball anymore
i got fed up with all the bullshit
lemme tell you something in a years when school kids study america theyre gonna learn about three things the constitution rock n roll and baseball
despite his mood john has to smile
how can you live in queens and not love the amazins
john warms to the topic of his boyhood heroes
if youre talking the amazin mets well thats different
you know people talk about seaver but ill love ron swoboda til the day i die
static crackles out over the radio
the signal weakens
through static im right with you man
hes got the heart of a lion
hey how bout the first game of the series
it was all over after buford nailed seavers first pitch outta the park
no way brother
aint gonna happen
bzzzsssshhhh loud static
the signal is gone
who the hell was that
behind him on tv larry king and hawking continue talking
seated at the polished wooden desk
the signal is gone
frank leans forward jiggles the frequency dial trying to regain the signal
slightly frustrated he stands and opens the glass doors to the family room where julia is watching tv a very young stephen hawking is being interviewed by walter cronkite
frankie johnny wants to say goodnight
a little distracted sure
he starts to take a step into the room and stumbles over elvis sleeping by the door
knocking into and cracking a glass pane in one door
john dog tired and more than a little wasted gets up from the desk inadvertently leaving the ham radio on and shuffles for the family room through the glass doors
camera holds close on the glass pane
cracked in the exact same spot where frank knocked into it years ago
frank unpins the police badge from johnnys shirt takes the whistle from around his neck
he pulls up the covers and softly kisses johnnys forehead
you can tell he loves this kid more than anything in the world
lullaby like take me out to the ballgame take me out with the crowd
buy me some peanuts and cracker jack
john plops down on sofa half asleep
the tv drones on
i dont care if i never get back
the legend reads october th first game of the world series blue sky
a softball soars into view
it drops down and into a willie mays style basket catch by frank sullivan
the same little league field that frank circled on his harley yesterday october
and the same field at which john sat in the stands drinking last night october
we are in the th inning of a friendly softball game between the local cops and firemen
a lot of nypd and fdny t shirts sweats and caps
plenty of mets stuff too
having made the catch frank coolly pulls the ball from his mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond
tagging up at rd sorely tempted to try for home is satch deleon nypd detective
satch feints for the plate frank feints the throw
for a maddening gleeful moment frank has satch caught between rd and home
in the stands johnny sullivan marge hersch and the families of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win this game of chicken
on the sidelines johnny gordo and the other kids serving as batboys and waterboys jump around in anticipation
at home butch foster stations himself to take the throw
suddenly satch fakes to rd then bolts for home
frank pegs it to butch who tags the sliding satch
lucky throw fire boy
jogging in luck my ass
they square off
pretending to fight
julia steps between them
and they all descend into laughter
frank and satch each wrap an arm around julia and start off
within a step johnny slips in under franks other arm
to johnny see that kid
close on a tv president nixon tosses the first ball to open the world series
reverse to see many of the players and families from teh softball game are parked around a couple of tvs watching the game
beer flows from a keg
soft drinks are passed around
hamburgers and hot dogs are cooking on the bbq
satch sits with johnny and gordo and some other kids
frank and julia tend the bbq
butch brings out some beers
a fun day
a detectives car pulls up next to a couple of blue whites at west th st
the northern tip of manhattan island
across construction barricades is a half torn down greek restaurant
several uniforms can be seen beyond it looking at something on the ground
as john exits the car the passenger door swings open and we meet a guy we havent seen in years satchel deleon
shaved head square jaw
a ram rod straight craggy warrior
thirty plus years on the force now endow him with a rare combination of smarts guts and sense of humor
as they walk dont choke on your pride sull
you aint ever gonna catch another one like that
she made up her mind
nothin i do is gonna change it
nothing youre willing to do
spotting john and satch a uniform approaches them
they keep on walking
whats the story
survey crew found a body
actually a skeleton
the uniform leads john and satch around some overgrown weeds to see a patch of freshly unearthed dirt
out of which sticks a human skull and collar bone
in the b
a crime scene unit can be seen arriving by van
be real careful when pulling it out
and get the dirt around it
as satch turns to talk to a second uniform and a couple of surveyors john notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far away
as he starts to him to satch i think ill visit the neighbor
close on fred shepard
as the scene unfolds we can see the half torn down diner crime scene through a window
satch oversees the operation
shepard hands john a cup of coffee
john looks out the window
used to get breakfast there all the time back from the boat
them greeks were good people
once that mcdonalds opened up on dyckman they lost all their business
john glances around the room notes family photographs
theres a picture of shepard in younger days on a commercial fishing boat
next to it a faded black and white picture of mrs
a few pictures of the shepards and their young son
and at the end a color photograph of the same son about in dress blues graduating from the police academy class of
your son on the job
carl died in the line of duty
shepard points to a frame above the fireplace distinguished service medal carl shepard awarded posthumously
my boy lived and bled blue
shepard stand very still
john discreetly glances at his watch
thunder in the distance
crime scene personnel have made some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains
a couple of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones
john stands looking down at the skeleton
a long beat
and then he turns to satch and they start for the car
behind them the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground
we see its wrists are bound with glass tape
chinese take out cartons are placed in a microwave
the woman holding the cartons julia sullivan years older than the last time we saw her
but she looks okay she looks happy
we are in the kitchen of julias upper west side apartment
it is raining
we notice the george washington bridge outside a bay window
calling out i thought itd be nicer to eat here
walking into the other room im sorry sam couldnt make it
lying badly yeah those grad school applications are driving her crazy
julia hands john a coke
close on her face she feels her sons pain

no kiddn he musta been pushing
so howd you like lion king

look whos talking
they share a laugh
and then slowly the laughter dies
johns expression changes as he quietly lights a cigarette
julia knows what hes thinking
a long beat
i wish i could remember him better
truth is most of the stuff i know is from the stories you used to tell
but theyre not mine
theyre not my memories
julia glances at an old photo of frank then back to john
you would have liked him john
and he would have liked you
the microwave timer sounds off
franks dog elvis
poking his nose in a carton of chinese take out on the floor
an arm drops into frame scruffs the puppys back
the rolex divers watch tells us the arm belongs to frank
frank sitting at his desk
he fires up an unfiltered lucky strike pops a rheingold
next to him a daily news headline wb yxb calling unidentified station queens
over radio sounds like hes had a few drinks hello

frank puts his finger on the squawk bar about to say something but just at that moment his son johnny appears in the doorway in his pajamas
daddy come up and sing the baseball
to johnny ill be up soon little chief
john sullivans face thunderstruck
the camera stays on john
he puts down his drink
sorry bout that

john looks up at the photo on the wall frank julia and six year old johnny sullivan circa
a beat then you call your son little chief

the call letters hang in the air
a breath then
now you listen to me
my name is john francis sullivan i live at st where ive lived my whole life
and i saw the first game of the series at my uncle butchs house with my father
frank dropping his cigarette in the ashtray
it rolls out and lies smoldering on the desk
he doesnt even notice
my dads name was frank patrick sullivan he was a fire fighter and a die hard mets fan
and every night when i went to bed he sang to me
softly almost singing take me out to the ball game take me out with the crowd
what the hell
im dreaming this
shit this is a dream
im not dreaming
john reaches out to touch the radio
but he stops his hand hovering just above it
so youre frank sullivan huh
its and youre sitting at your desk in the study just chewin the rag
he smells smoke sees the cigarette burning a hole in the desk
spooked smokey the bear just started a fire
frank beats out the flame with the newspaper
whats going on
i just spilled something
john pushes the bushmills to the side staring at the scar
it hits him hard
oh my god
you just burned the desk
john rubs his fingers over the old burn scar
you burnt the desk
i can see it
eerie quiet the only sound is the rain outside johns window
what if its not
reaching out touching the radio
a long moment of absorption
intercut frank and john
how could this be happening
i dont know
we gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time
yeah thats how hams work
wait a sec
there was something on the news
something about this space anomaly
i think they said it was connected to some storm in
frank glances at daily news headline space storm
he says nothing for a long beat struggling to understand
im thirty five years old
that would make it
frank pulls back from the radio
this is wrong
who are you
why are you doing this
im not doing anything
beat look i dont know whats going on
but i swear on my life i m here at your old desk on your ham in our house right now
johns voice has a conviction that frank cannot deny

both men trying to wrap their minds around the reality of the situation
jesus youre almost as old as i am
long beat whats your life like

too busy playin ball huh

john takes a sip the answer caught in his throat

pausing its good to hear your voice
quiet beat i missed you
a burst of static crackles the air
re static whats that

the signal breaks up then returns weaker
what are you talking about
i lost you
i never knew you dad

it was an abandoned warehouse hit by lightening
beat butch told ma it was just one wrong turn
said it wasnt your fault
you went with the training with your instincts
beat if youd just gone left instead of right you wouldve made it
that cant be

it did pop
heavy static now
they can barely hear each other
but thats tomorrow
fully realizing tomorrow
it hasnt happened
it doesnt have to happen
both men frantic
their words overlapping
dont go in that warehouse
i dont understand
final blast of static
the signal is gone
the band is moonlight casts a glow over the sleeping johnny
frank steps in and stands looking down at him
john crawls out a window through the rain onto the roof
rusted ham radio antenna half fallen over
john scoots over to it straightening it
but he slips sliding down the roof coming to rest against the chimney
a light pops on from an upstairs window across the street
gordo appears in the window
does a double take when he sees john sitting on the roof soaked drunk
sliding open window sull
what the hell
i talked to him gordo
i talked to my dad
gordos heart starts to break
his best friend has slipped over the edge
ill come over
well play some nintendo
i gotta tell him the address so he doesnt go in
go in where
i know pal
twenty nine years tomorrow
the legend reads october th second game of the world series black clouds earth shattering thunder
a massive bolt of lightning rockets out of the menacing sky striking through a window on the rd floor of the warehouse
a fire begins
game plays on tv
butch gibson and the rest of the unit sit around enjoying the game
a very distracted frank stands watching from the doorway to the kitchen
we are in the bottom of the th with the baltimore orioles brooks robinson coming to the plate
robinson is gonna nail it and were gonna be dead
suddenly the alarm sounds moving the groaning firemen reluctantly to action and freezing frank in surging anxiety
gibson is up and passing frank
who begins to move like hes in a trance
a rapid montage of frank butch and the others readying to head out
gibson grabs a little transistor radio
lets move it gentlemen
lit up abandoned warehouse
frank looks like hes going to throw up
john lost in thought rounds a corner towards the bar
the ladder engine trucks barrel out of the firehouse
as sirens scream frank and gibson secure themselves into position
gibson excitedly switches on his radio to the game
he notes that frank is not the least bit into it
sully you cool
frank seems not to hear him
im alright gibby
from the radio we hear the last play of the game as brooks robinson grounds out rd to st
cheers are heard in the streets and from the cabs of the racing fire trucks
gibson whoops it up
frank barely acknowledges the win
john moves through the crowd of cops ad lib greetings slides into a booth occupied by satch and gordo
how you feeling
you get your roof fixed
john shoots a look at gordo who quickly changes the subject
can you believe it yahoo goes up another point today
located off the east river in lower manhattan
the th battalion fire trucks are first on the scene
a couple of green whites are already there uniform cops keeping a few onlookers at a safe distance
flames shoot out from the th and th floor windows
starting to lick their way up to the th floor and roof
smoke billows out of the windows on the rd and nd floors
lighter smoke spirals out from the door on the st floor
frank gibson and other firemen under butchs command take stock of the situation and start to deploy
hoses are run from hydrants to the pumper trucks
the ladder is swung into position for an assault on the roof
bastards moving fast
thank god its abandoned
to the men surround and drown
nobody goes in
frank nods in agreement
directly above them another bolt of lightning cracks through the darkening sky
a death shudder creeps up franks spine
and for the first time in his life frank sullivan is scared shitless
frank stares up at the sky transfixed
thunder punches the sky with a huge roar
rain starts to fall
and in the distance as if from inside the burning building a faint screaming is first heard and growing louder
suddenly out of the building runs a stoned teenage girl screaming and babbling incoherently
shes up there
immediately galvanized frank moves to the girl
its gonna be okay
were gonna help
she starts to calm down
now tell me whos up there
my girlfriend molly
in a room
we live there
something fell on her
i couldnt help her
please you gotta
frank looks to butch
butch gives him the nod
frank and gibson gear up and go
you realize that if youd bought a thousand dollars worth of yahoo in itd be worth fifty grand today
you doin okay john
tough day you know
satch and gordo nod in sympathy
gordo raises his glass
satch and john follow
a yearly ritual
to your dad
to my dad
frank and gibson step into the warehouse
butch behind them
flames havent reached this area yet but the roar of the fire above them is deafening and smoke billows down the stairway before them
they sprint towards it and start up
three floors and suddenly they are face to face with a wall of fire blocking access to the th floor
frank and gibson stop and stare into the inferno
it looks open on the other side
dont know whats behind it
one way to find out
and he barrels through the line of fire onto the th floor
gibson starts to do the same when the th floor gives way above frank sending burning timber and debris cascading around him and cutting off gibsons route
now franks only way to go is up the stairs toward the th floor
he turns to gibson
coming up behind him is butch
across a gulf of flames frank yells and waves at them to get the hell out
and then suddenly part of the rd floor around gibson and butch starts to go
screaming over fire get out
while you still can
frank turns and bolts for the th floor as a huge flaming beam crashes down onto the stairway behind him forcing gibson and butch to scramble like hell back down
soft its not your time
fire fighters are efficiently and expertly hard at it
running out lines
moving a fire boat into place all communicating via walkie talkies all on teh same frequency
the big ladder is now in place
as it telescopes up the roof man bill cawley begins his climb
pump trucks and the fire boat keep pumping water onto the blaze
but no matter
for the moment this is one out of frank reaching the th floor
its an inferno
he keeps moving tearing up the stairs for the th floor
over walkie gotta be another way up frank
into walkie then fuckin find it
heading in im going for the girl
over walkie billy you better get up top
roof man edges up the ladder as it telescopes above him
this is billy frank
im on my way
reaching th floor glad to hear it
see you on top
fire has torched open a gaping hole in the roof
frank peers around through the smoke and fire and rain
then he sees huddled in the temporary saftey of the corner of an office but trapped by a fallen conduit the girl passed out from smoke inhalation
into walkie ive found the girl
frank dashes into the office and heaves the conduit off the girl
he hoists her over his shoulder and heads out
butch and gibson exit the warehouse past the hose crew already working its way into the building
they look up to the top of the warehouse where the ladder is haltingly inching its way up the side of the building
the fire on this floor is now a raging inferno
flames shoot up from the stairway below through the open roof
surrounded by fire frank carrying the girl strides for what looks like a window on the south side of the floor
into walkie its real hot in here billy
im coming out quick
but apprehension rips across franks eyes as he reaches the window and looks down to see
the top end of the ladder frozen some feet below the im jammed up here frank
butch and gibson are now by the base of the ladder truck which is near the canal side of the building
butch screams at the ladder operator
what the fuck gino
gear box cracked butch
into walkie frank
i know butch
frank clicks off the walkie talkie and turns to survey the hell around him
the stairway is gone
to the right is a door flames around it but none coming from the room beyond it
to the left another door a metal one this one surrounded by fire flames licking out all around it from room beyond
frank turns heads towards door on the right
heart pounding one wrong turn
beat if youd just gone left
and for the first time in his life frank sullivan goes against his instincts and his training as he
gordo is in the middle of a story when
principal calls us in cause gordy hacked into the school system sent out a little x rated e mail
nervous laughter scary huh
eight years old
just keep him away from girls
something happens time stutters and repeats repeat just keep him away from girls
the effect is like a phonograph needle stuck in the groove
it lasts only a second and nobody seems to notice
nobody except john who looks wildly disoriented
he grabs hold of the edge of the table as if to keep his equilibrium
john breaks into a cold sweat
his heart pounding away
franks reaches the door on the left
white heat and flames shoot everywhere
a fucking furnace
he tires to open it
frank kicks at it
the door blows open and flames leap out the energy of the blast tossing frank and the unconscious girl back onto the floor fire surging over their heads
he sees something on the other side of the doorway inside the room on the far wall
frank cradles the girl
gets down on his knees crawling under the heat
reaching the swinging door
pushes it open revealing a smooth metal spiral seed bag chute
frank rips open his jacket and bundles the girl to him
he works himself and the girl onto the top of the chute
the room begins to shake
bricks tumble out of the wall
the whole goddamn building is going to collapse
frank lurches forward until he and the girl start to move down the chute
as frank and the girl plunge through the bowels of the inferno
large portions of the building begins disintegrating around them
a giant storm of bricks mortar metal and burning wood biting their tails
gaining speed through each up rushing floor
frank and the girl zoom down towards the end of the slide only to find its boarded up
frank grips the girl tight raises his boots bends his knees and like a human battering ram smashes through the theyre airborne
frank and the girl
floating in slow motion out over the canal and landing in the water between the warehouse dock and the fireboat
a yell snaps butchs and gibsons attention to what is happening
gibson starts running for the canal ripping off his coat and hat before leaping into the water
but frank is getting pulled down by his fire tank and the weight of the girl
finally gibson reaches him taking the girl
frank quickly sheds his jacket and the tank
butch stands watching on the dock
he takes a moment to close his eyes in thankful prayer
you okay man
starting to giggle elvis has left the building
hitting the water has shot the girl back to consciousness
a look passes between her and gibson
a look he wont forget
then the thunderous sound of the warehouse caving in on itself sending flames shooting high into the sky
frank lies back floating on the water the rain pelting around him letting the miracle of it all take him over
soft little chief
it happens again
time stutters and repeats
as if the film sprockets were caught in the projector
the glass shatters again
camera ratchets into the exploding storm of the flying glass ice and whiskey
and then time stops as we hold close on a frozen shard in it the cracked reflection of johns eye
the camera moves through the reflection and into
a burst of light and then
like looking at reflections through a smashed mirror
the cracks gel and we are in
frank johnny butch and satch at the world series
johnny and gordo sitting on franks lap at the ham
frank and johnny playing catch
johnny winning a swimming race at longbranch boys club frank cheering
frank julia and satch beaming with pride as john graduates from the police academy
these images appear as disjointed fragments of new memories a past that didnt exist before
a past where frank sullivan didnt die in that fire
its like watching random frames from the sullivan familys mm home movies as johns brain struggles to absorb decades of new memories in the span of seconds
normal vision slowly returning
the broken glass is rocking on the table
john you all right
a whisper longbranch
john doesnt respond
youre not looking too good
whoa i just
what is it
my father didnt die in a fire
my father didnt die in a fire
what are you talking about
he had cancer john
it was the cigarettes
yeah lung cancer
ten years ago
his hand shaking john takes a long sip of his beer
gordo and satch exchange a concerned look
maybe you outta lay off a little
gordo i wasnt dreaming
i talked to him it was real
the ham radio
thats how come he didnt die in the fire
a loaded silence
three guys looking at each other thinking very different things
into radio mic johnny
cmon chief answer me
nothing but static
frank jiggles the frequency dial
louder chief are you there
and then a voice
im right here daddy
johnny sleepy faced wrapped in his blankie stands just outside the room he looks a little scared
its okay chief
johnny shuffles over frank lifts him up on his knee brushes the hair out of his face
and gets an idea
streetlights flood the tree lined street
frank johnny standing next to the little red bicycle
okay partner whatta you say we tame this bronco
johnnys eyes shame fear doesnt want to disappoint his father again but too scared to get on the bike
frank reaches out holds johnnys hand
dont be scared
this time im right behind you if you fall
daddy daddy i cant
no but we can
we can do it together
spirit and guts chief
a long beat
johnny takes a deep breath nods ok slowly getting on the bike
franks holding on to the seat
take your time
im not gonna let go til you say okay
johnny takes a gulp of air starts pedaling
slowly moving forward
the bike picks up some speed
im right here behind you
franks still running alongside holding on to the seat
frank lets go
johnny keeps pumping those little six year old legs
a bit wobbly at first but hes gonna make it
on johnnys eyes determination self confidence
you got it you got it
way to go chief
im doing it
im doing it
the proud father
under his breath atta boy
johnny blissfully riding around frank in a big gentle circle
frank slowly spins around keeping his eyes on his little chief
john walks in the front door takes off his coat
the house looks different
cleaner furnishings less ragged
john moves through his home taking in the subtle changes
he reaches the study
and there beside the desk is something that makes him stop a photograph on the wall beside the desk frank julia oh my god
the picture changed
john aged from to
julias hairstyle and clothes changed from s to s
franks hair receded and grayed
jon is staring at evidence of a history that didnt exist before
john grabs the old family scrapbook he found in franks trunk
opens it unfolds fireman killed clipping
the main headline still reads october
amazins but the sub headline now reads fireman rescues runaway from john turns stares at the radio questioningly
he starts to sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front edge of it
words carved into the wood years ago by fire fighter frank sullivan
the day john saved his fathers life im still here chief the last letter is missing
but then a patch of wood starts to morph as if it were being carved by an invisible knife
through radio can you hear me
one hand on the squawk bar the other holds the jack knife he is using to finish carving the letter f
through radio dad
is that you
yeah its me
youre the voice of an angel johnny
if you hadnt told me no way i woulda ever made it
frank cuts himself off in mid sentence
dad you there
beat what about you
i want to know
and your mom
john hesitates for a moment
lights up a smoke
were doing all right dad
were doing good
its hard to explain
something happened today
it was like a dream
and when i woke up i had all these new memories
times we never had before
but john looks troubled
something bothering him
he takes a hit off his cigarette
dad i gotta tell you this
cause you should know
cause i still remember
what is it
what it was like when you died in the fire
both men are silent for some moments
the hum of static
a breath then john contd we needed you
i needed you
so many times
i wished for you
but you werent there for me
beat mom tried
but she was hurting
i used to hear her every night for years crying herself to sleep
frank grips the radio mic stunned
i didnt think
the static grows
john leans into the mic well you think about it
and you remember cause i dont wanna lose you again
i dont ever want mom
johns voice cracks choking back the tears
over static you wont
i swear to god you wont
i love you son
a blast of static
the signal is gone
it is quiet
john leans back
takes a breath
reaches out for the phone
through answering machine hi this is julia
please leave a message after the tone
ma its me
we gotta talk
as john slowly hangs up the phone something catches his eye
something that wasnt there yesterday
through several glass windows a clock reads pm
julia and other medical personnel are working on a heart attach victim and they are winning
she is in charge and she is impressive
a sixth sense causes her to look up to see standing behind the windows
gazing at his wife
julia holds on him for a split second concern and surprise etching across her face
she turns back to her work then says something to another er nurse who nods okay
satisfied the patient is out of the woods she peels off her gloves and heads for the door
julia steps through the door as frank approaches
i just wanted to see you
he takes her in his arms snuggling his head against her neck losing himself in the scent of her hair
frank contd whisper im not goin anywhere jules
for the rest of your life
its hard to tell we cant see his face but it looks like frank is crying
frankie what is it
but frank is silent
so they just stand there holding each other
and then julia notices the burn and scrape marks on franks arms and neck
julia contd i got a bad feeling today
i was worried
bruised but not broken
frank pulls his head back looks into his wifes eyes and kisses her on the mouth
its a long kiss
as they come up for air
i tucked him in at gordos
you give him his drops
one in each ear
beat what would you do without me
probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work
julia sees something through a glass door that stops her short
a young intern is standing over a gurneyed patient
the young intern is changing the i
julia contd whats he doing
frank i gotta
he knows shes back on the job
waves no problem
julia interrupts the young intern as he hooks up the bag
excuse me doctor is that benazepril
julia quickly shuts off the i
i gave this patient mills of benedryal on admittance
bag mix them and hes dead
why wasnt i made aware
its in his chart
the intern steps back oh shit
julia takes charge
the patient stirs a scraggly hippie looks kind of like pacino in serpico
a breathing mask covers his bearded face
barely conscious his eyes focus on julia
after a quick double check of the patient julia looks up
through the glass door she can see frank watching
mouthing to words i love you bud
mouthing back i love you more
the clock on the wall now reads am
and the legend reads october th world series travel day men and women standing and sitting seen only from teh waist down
all wearing dark cloths and speaking in hushed voices
a recognizable voice
the edge of a casket
john is bathed in sweat
he twists to camera and his eyes pop open
a glazed confused look pours out of them
see past an empty bottle of bushmills on the night stand a clock reads am
the nightmare repeats like some horrible instant replay
men and women standing and sitting seen only from the waist down
all wearing dark clothes and speaking in hushed voices
flashes of faces swimming into the pov
indistinct blurring into each other
is that uncle butch
a terrified and disoriented john stumbles out of bed
he moves to the bathroom
but he stops
something is wrong
the bedroom has changed
it looks like a dump
john shakes his head trying to blink away the nightmare
but the room does not change back
he goes to teh bathroom
splashes his face
he looks up to the mirror and
the same horrible instant replay
flashes of faces swimming into the pov
he is crouched under a table
staring at the casket
a man seen only from teh waist down approaches the table
as he crouches down his face drops into the frame
it is frank
his face etched in a terrible pain
the kitchen looks different dirtier uncared for
john looks different too like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime bender
he cracks open a bushmills
pours a couple of shots into his instant coffee
several sips to settle his nerves
he reaches for the cordless phone and hits speed dial
can you hold
confused john clicks down the receiver
his hand is shaking as he punches the speed dial button for the second time
on the slam of johns phone we got to
john knocks on the door
it opens to reveal a jamaican woman clutching a crying infant a toddler hanging off her leg
behind them we half recognize julias apartment
we know its her apartment because of the bay window and the view of the george washington bridge
but everything else is different
different pain job
john stands speechless
the jamaican woman regards him
can i help you
relaxed im looking for julia sullivan
i think you have the wrong apartment
but this is her place
im sorry but no one by that name lives here
john just stands there lost questioning his grip on reality
liquor on his breath fear in his eyes he is a scary sight
jamaican woman does the smart thing she slams the door
on satch scavenging the fridge while absorbed in some papers
through the open door he spots john across the squad room
even at that distance satch can see johns unsteady walk and fucked up demeanor
satchs eyes go to stone
john leans over the sink wet paper towels pressed to his face
he barely reacts to the sound of the door
he does react to the silence that follows
satch stands in the doorway
looking him over
a long silence
another rough night huh
john moves for the door
but satch grabs him slams him against the wall
startled john freezes
do not disrespect me
disrespect yourself all you want
but not me
or anybody else around here
you got that
john shrugs sagging against the wall
this is getting real old john
and im tired up to here with it
and im tired of the im sorrys
i dont need em
what i need is a partner i can count on
pause softens i care about you
not cause of me and your old man
not cause of your mom
but because of you
satch steps back
an awkward beat
we got the preliminary forensics on that skeleton
opening door to the squad your gonna want to look at it
satch and john approach their adjoining desks
satch slides an x photo off the top of an old yellowed police file and hands it to john
it is a picture of the skeleton discovered behind the greek diner
but what catches johns attention what picks at his subconscious is the decaying glass tape binding the wrists
re photo you imagine the odds
us diggin up a nightingale murder
john looks from the photo to the file on satchs desk
it reads nightingale murders
john slowly sinks into his chair
she makes ten
i remember this case
he killed three women
whatre you talking
you know better than anybody john
youve read this file a thousand times
john fixes on the file
then slowly reaches for it
its filled with police and forensics reports
crime scene shots of dead women
linked by two gruesome details they were all garroted wrists bound with glass tape
john turns over the last photo and his heart stops
his universe crashing down on him
julia is at the door watching frank tuck johnny in
johnny wears his mets cap and cradles his baseball glove
hes in that exhausted excited kid moment before sleep sets in
very soft buy me some peanuts and cracker jack
i dont care if i never get back
johnnys eyes close
boy is he excited about the game tomorrow
he aint the only one
marvin gaye plays from the hi fi
frank grabs a beer as julia comes in putting on her coat while taking her keys from a hook
shes wearing her nurses uniform
turning to her wish you werent
stepping to him do you know how much i love you
frank takes her in his arms
starts to move her to the music
yeah actually i do
he starts to slip her coat off
she laughs and wriggles away from him
and she is out the door
john pulls in past samanthas car as she comes out the back door with the teddy bear and other stuff she left behind
john gets out of his car clutching the nightingale file
his eyes are red swollen by tears and booze
john are you all right
the answer is no
he looks terrible as haunted as any man could possibly be
he doesnt mean to but he snaps what are you doing here
samantha jumps frightened
ellen said you were working
i just wanted to pick up the rest
john turns lost and ashamed
sam walks to her car and starts to cry
john enters plunks the nightingale file on the desk
he stares at the family photograph on the wall
julia is missing
a look of loss in frank and johns faces
john fingers the nightingale file
he hits the answering machine button to hear samanthas halting message
as that plays
john steps to teh counter and pours himself a stiff bushmills
turns and steps back into
john collapses in the chair
stares at the words carved in the desk im still here chief
he rubs his fingers over the smooth carving
his eyes going to the radio
a quiet moment
john slowly puts his hand on the squawk leans into the mic
dad you there
can you here me
i need you to be there
a long beat
the hum of static
through radio right here chief
sorry i lost you last night
damn thing keeps cutting out
i need to
are you alright
sipping bushmills something happened something
johnny whats wrong
what is it
shes not here
whatta you mean shes not here
its like it just happened
she just died your mother just died
no dad it happened a long time ago a long time ago for me
a dreadful moment of silence
ten days from now
johnny i gotta know
you could hear a fuckin pin drop
she was murdered
eerie silence as johns words hang in the air
there was this case
he murdered three women all nurses between and
the papers called them the nightingale murders
they never caught him
but the killings just stopped
what kinda twisted animal
dad we did something
something to make it worse
whatta you mean
he didnt just kill three women anymore
he killed ten
what are you talking about
something we did changed the case
beat mom wasnt dead
but then after you didnt die in the fire something must have happened
and this guy this nightingale guy he kept on killing
it was like a spree
seven more women
i gotta take her away john
im gonna take your mother away
he cant hurt her if i take her away
i dont know
beat what about the other women
ill warn them
thatll never work
theyll just think youre crazy
what can we do
you dont even know who this guy is
realizing wait a minute
i might not know who he is but i know where hes gonna be
i got the case file
we know what hes gonna do before he does it
so what should i do
call the police
you think theyll believe me
they will if they catch him in the act
you can make that happen dad
you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment
i dont know john
im a fire fighter
this is different
i do know
im a cop
this is what i do
john takes a long sip from the bushmills
you ever talk to a victims family
the ones left behind
they dont act like what youd think
theres panic and fear
but mostly its like theres this logic problem
and if they could only solve it everything would be okay
a breath but if you look real close look at their eyes you can see it
just a glimmer
but somewhere they know
they know their world is never gonna be the same
what if the radio stops working
christ what if i cant reach you again
then you get mom the hell out
but dad those other women werent supposed to die
we dont try to stop this guy were gonna live with that for the rest of our lives
frank takes a deep breath swallows some air
what do i gotta do
john grabs the thick yellowed police file
opens to homicide report on karen reynolds
close on forensic photo the next victim was karen reynolds
it happens tomorrow
reading case file says she left st
vincents at six
showd up at cozys bar around six thirty
she walked outta that bar around seven thirty
they found her dead in an empty lot behind the place at eight oclock
frank jots down teh info
why not just get the cops to watch the bar
theyll question her
whatever they tell her could change what happens
beat no i want you to follow her
see if anybodys watching her hittin on her
im betting somebodys gonna walk outta that bar with her
when they do you call the cops
close on nightingale file on johns desk
zoom in on the date below karens homicide photo october
the legend reads october th rd game of the world series a woman waits to pay for a mini pack of kleenex and some gum
a wool coat over her nurses uniform
franks and johns voices continue over the scene
what do i tell them
tell em theres a homicide in progress
cause by the time they show up there will be
as karen moves to the cash register the camera widens to reveal frank awkwardly pretending to read a magazine
frank readies to follow her when he suddenly trips over a crate of vegetables and goes down on one knee
karen looks in the direction of the accident and for a split second her eyes lock with franks
embarrassed frank looks away as he rights himself
frank edges out of the grocery store as karen steps into the street and dodges traffic towards a corner bar restaurant at the end of the block past a heavily
overgrown vacant lot
frank follows karen across the street and finds himself just as karen enters the bar at a point near the murder site described by john
he pauses to stare at it
frank enters the place
sort of a singles atmosphere but a comfortable one
its happy hour
on the tv the mets gil hodges offers his analysis of game
frank looks about down the bar and into an area with booths and tables
a few folks at the bar
a group of young women laughing in a booth
but no karen reynolds
franks blood runs cold in a spasm of panic when
frank wheels around just as karen passes him from teh ladies room
there is the trace of a bump enough for karen to take note of frank
ad lib excuse me
she then starts moving down teh bar towards the booth of young women
frank checks out everyone in the bar not knowing quite what hes looking for
karen slips into the booth with her friends
ad lib hellos
frank orders a beer but his eyes are fixed on the booth
karen and a friend take note of frank staring at them
embarrassed he turns away checking his watch pm
and at just that moment a scraggly man passes by taking a seat at the end of the bar
we have seen this man before
satch and a young detective stand at the sinks washing up
is that really how you got the son of sam
satch shrugs a yes
wipes his hands and heads out into the squad
the young detective follows
johns at his desk
keeps glancing at the phone fiddling with the nightingale file
a photograph of karen reynolds
satch passes john on his way to the coffee machine
any word on our bones
john shakes his head no
young detective joins satch at the coffee machine
john overhears but howd you think of it
youre pulling over with a
bulldog tucked in your pants getting ready to blow somebodys brains out
i figure the last thing youre thinking about is alternate side of the street parking
young detective nods impressed
john is less impressed
thats what we need here satch
a lucky break
that wasnt luck johnny boy
that was smarts and ten plus on the job
bottle of rheingold drops into frame next to half empty one
from the girls pal
all of em
frank glances at the women in the booth
theyre all looking at him smiling
a big one from karen
his watch says
taking the new bottle frank steps from the bar past the scraggly man and walks to the booth
charmingly shy frank is kind of at a loss for words
i was uh im not really
noting franks jacket fireman huh
noting wedding ring a married fireman
oh what the hell
have a seat
whats your name fireman
and frank takes a seat sliding in next to karen
an awkward moment for him as she takes a closer look at his face
do i know you
i dont think so
puts it together from the korean market up the street
lee make you pay for those veggies
you following her frank
youre not some kind of stalker or something
i follow fires nothing else
general laughter all around
john has a corkboard set up next to his desk
on it he has arrayed several photos of the nigthingale victims under the dates of their murders
he looks over at the photos then at the forensics photo of karen reynolds on his desk
john shoots a look at the wall clock
grabbing the phone sullivan
beat youre kiddin
grabbing pen scribbling satch is alerted by johns sudden burst of energy
mario you are the best
right right right
spell it out for me
at the bar the scraggly man stares at frank and the women
franks checks his watch as he tells a story
yeah it was a close call but
the news said it was a miracle you guys got out alive
close is just close if youre still alive to talk about it yknow the women around him are clearly enraptured
at the bar the scraggly man looking frustrated slides off his stool and strides out of the place
john hangs up the phone
satch looks at him whatta we got
our lucky break
mario idd the dental
reported missing april
looking at corkboard april
that means she was the first
which means he probably knew her
this case just got hot
we pull on this string
but for some strange reason john has stopped listening to satch
something else has got his full attention
it is the nightingale file that lays open on his desk
it is changing
karen reynolds forensic photo disappears
in fact everything about her all evidence of her murder police reports photos witness reports is gone
johns eyes shoot to the corkboard
the head shot of karen reynolds and the date of her murder are also gone
john looks between the file and the board
frank and julia stand on the porch eyes on johnny up past bedtime proudly riding his bike up and down the street
a stretch and a yawn i think im gonna head up take a shower
slight smile you wanna tuck the monster in and join me
frank doesnt take the bait
whats the matter

a soft burst of static
the signal returns a little fuzzy

frank laughs as gordo climbs up on his lab
this is the space cowboy
im an intergalactic traveler from the federation planet earth

john sits back marvelling at how young gordo sounds
a thousand childhood memories playing in his head
and then he lights up
realizing the opportunity

gordo scampers out
static filters through both radios then
john you still there

no matter what
a burst of loud static
the band goes dead
john takes a beat to come down
he gets up making his way into the kitchen
theres a half full bottle of bushmills on the counter
john reaches out to grab but the bottle
but then he stops
it is time to stop
john turns on the faucet and dumps the booze down the drain
the legend reads october th fourth game of the world series a white vinyl diary with a blue heart shaped padlock held by a hand
a page is turned and the name alan silver comes clear
an old catholic high school yearbook on the dresser below the diary and a picture of daryl adams years old
can i keep these for a little while
on sophia finelli a profound sadness sits at her core
detectives been through that stuff already back then
youll bring them back soon
john pulls a clear plastic bag from his pocket with a patch of the partially disintegrated clothing found on mary finellis skeleton
do you know this
finelli gasps in recognition her eyes turning to a closet door
john opens the door to reveal marys clothes lined up in perfect order
visible among them is a candy striper uniform
a perfect match with the patch john holds
mary volunteered over at st
vincents after school
she loved it
was going to become a doctor
tears start to run down her cheeks
john understands this womans pain
he looks around the room at marys possessions
mary and her family
mary and her friends
i just couldnt
it should only be her room
john does know
im happy you found her detective
it makes it easier
now to know for sure
john and satch stand at the urinals
okay lemme walk you through it
mind if i shake it off first
sos i can concentrate better
john waits for satch to finish
then as they head out into the hallway
three guys show up in both the yearbook and diary
the first guy passed away ten years ago
the second one died in vietnam
the room has a holding pen opposite the door
a table is pushed up against the door wall and a more elaborate layout of the murder victims paperwork and calendar timeline graphs sit on the table and are pinned
on a cork board
mary finellis uniform is there
john shows satch a photo in mary finellis year book
the third one is daryl adams
satch looks nods and steps back
waits for more
john hands him daryl adams rap sheet
i ran him through bci
got a hit
busted for sexual assault march
eight days after the last nightingale murder
so you figure the murders stop cause hes off the street
then by the time he gets paroled hes smartened up enough to control himself
not the first time thats been true
im telling you i got a feeling about this guy
this is the guy satch
im just trying to figure what interests me more the possibility that daryl is the guy or you making him absolutely the guy
sissy clark steps off a bus
she crosses the street towards the club
the bus moves out and wipes frame revealing frank sitting at the intersection on his harley
sissy enters the club
frank guns the harley into an alley
business is light at this hour
the bartender is setting up
the flying nun plays on a couple tvs over the bar the audio drowned out by loud motown music
frank enters and looks around
this time he does not panic
he sits at the bar
the year old face of daryl adams
a notably unimposing guy
he is not a happy camper
he is one of two plumbers installing fixtures in the kitchen of a new place
several other people are at work getting the kitchen ready
so as not to be overheard
that was over thirty years ago
i paid for that and then some
you go to xavier high school daryl
you remember mary finelli
mentally steps back what are you saying
you know what im saying
no i dont
well i think you do
hawaii five o plays on the tvs the rolling stones over it
frank sits at the same place we last saw him watching sissy and scanning the crowd trying to find a face that might give him pause
sissy looking sixty and terrific in her go go waitress outfit moves about doing business
she steps to the bartender t give her drink orders and pick up prepared drinks coming within inches of frank
give me a couple bloodys gus and a dewars on the rocks
she casts a friendly eye at frank
how ya doin there
right now just fine
ask me later fireman
and shes off with the drinks
he checks his watch
it reads pm
a clock on the wall reads pm the nightingale murders display has been removed
daryl sits at the table in the middle of the room
john sits opposite him
satch leans against the two way mirror wall
sexual assault daryl
but you got lucky right
you got away with something else
something you figured nobody knows about
what i know is what i told you
let me tell you what i know daryl
you went to saint xavier with mary
you lived five blocks from her
you liked her
but she aint interested
that mustve hurt huh
so whatd you do about it daryl
satch can see this is going nowhere
the oclock news is on tv
a super shows the mets won game
mets lead series
creedence clearwater plays out of the sound system
sissy takes the order from a long haired guy down the bar his back to the camera and starts towards the cash register area
the bartender serves frank another club soda
as frank drinks the bartender pulls a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket
but the pack is empty
you spare a smoke
im trying to quite
turns out those thingsll kill you
the bartender laughs as frank stands and heads for the bathroom
a clock reflected in the two way mirror
satch stands drinking a cup of coffee behind the mirror
before him through the glass sits daryl adams with john pacing like a panther ready to spring
suddenly he slaps down crime scene homicide photos of several women in front of daryl who blanches
oh my god
what is that
why you showing me this shit
get those away from me
these names mean anything to you asshole
she mean anything
she means something to me
john looks like hes about to hit daryl but he glances towards the two way mirror controls himself
nilssons everybodys talkin fills the air
a sexy woman approaches frank wearing an emma peel body suit
sissy stands nearby giving drink orders to the bartender she cant help but smile at the following
you fight fires honey
thats what i do
i bet you do
the bartender leans into the pa at the bar and announces
frank flashes his wedding ring at the sexy woman
smiles at her and shrugs im sorry
the clock reads am
john sits at the end of the table opposite daryl
his quiet masks the dark menace he is barely in control of
daryl stares at him like a deer caught in the headlights
satch sets a coke before daryl and starts to leave the room
i gotta take a leak
to daryl you need to use the head
you can yknow
if you want to
daryl shakes his head no
end of the night
the place winds down
an old movie on the tvs
elvis suspicious minds plays softly
frank watches as sissy picks up her last tip and heads to the back to change into her street clothes
see you fireman
dont talk so much next time
frank smiles checks the time
he looks around
nobody suspicious about
he starts up for the bathroom
satch enters with a fresh cup of coffee settles back to watch
with great ceremony john removes his watch his gun and lastly his badge and sets them off to one side
you know daryl sometimes despite all the training we cops go through
despite all that we are taught about right and wrong
despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves we can come to a place where we dont give a fuck
know what i mean
and john starts up from his seat and walks toward daryl
you are going to tell me what i need to know daryl
suddenly in the door strides
looks towards satch
got a minute
satch opens the door and steps out
john collects his watch badge and gun and follows
he aint our guy john
just cause he didnt want to look at the photos doesnt mean he isnt the doer
not everyone fits the profile
if he was gonna give something up he woulda done it already
john pauses for several seconds then nods slowly
suspicious minds filters in
frank zips up heads to the sink
bends over to wash his hands and suddenly
his face is smashed on the edge of the sink
he twists to the floor fighting to maintain consciousness
a black frye boot explodes into franks gut
he rolls over looks up at the long haired guy from the bar
frank seems to recognize him
we know him too scraggly man
but we dont know his name yet
so well call him
you following me
killers eyes evil fuckin black dots
he lifts frank to his knees
then rips a fist into franks face
i asked you a question asshole
frank is clearly incapacitated
killer lifts him to his feet so they are eye to eye
barely able to speak mary finelli
a look of absolute shock wipes across the killers face
who the fuck are you
caught off guard frank is able to slam his knee into killers balls
killer goes down like a stone but frank is too battered to take advantage
he collapses on top of killer who pushes him off scrambles up and delivers a massive kick to his head
frank is out cold
quickly killer rolls frank over and rifles his pockets finding his wallet
he grabs something from it then tosses it aside
he then takes something out of his pocket a thin leather garrote
he coils it around his hands and snaps it taut
he bends down to start the job when suddenly the bathroom door opens and
two very stoned men stumble in
is he okay
he just needs a little time kissing the porcelain
and killer muscles frank into a toilet stall and puts his head in the bowl
he closes the door quickly leaving
in the stall frank spills onto the floor his legs sticking out into the bathroom
his face flush to the tile his eyes trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall
john gets in his car
sits there staring into the night
frank starts to come around
he reaches out and grabs his wallet off the floor
his money still there
credit cards too
but somethings missing
his drivers license
frank tears up the stairs
frank bangs on it
open up open the door
this frank keeps banging on the door
a neighbors door swings open a crack
an old lady peers out from behind a security chain
frank stops banging
its okay maam
im the police
old lady skeptically looking him up down noticing franks bruised face
she quickly closes the door
frank reaches inside his jacket pocket pulls out a small bent metal wire homemade lockpick
he goes to work on sissys lock
click click click got it
he opens the door steps inside
and then a sound
scratching and popping the sound of a phonograph needle makes when it reaches the end of the vinyl and is scratching against the label
the wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street light to beam brightly into the room and in one swift moment frank is staring at a nightmare sissy
clarks murdered body
her dress hiked above her waist
her panties ripped off
paper stuffed into her mouth
her hands bound with glass tape
frank is transfixed and sickened by sissys twisted face her eyes frozen open in horrible death
frank staggers out of the building towards his harley
he bends over and blows his dinner then mounts the bike and kicks the motor over
as he roars off down the street we see in the building window
the old lady looking down at him
the legend reads october th fifth game of the world series he killed her john
he killed her and i didnt do a thing to stop it
its not your fault dad
yes it is
we did this
we changed everything
pausing ive been having bad dreams johnny
dreams where i die
in the fire
soft i was supposed to die in that warehouse
trembling overcome by an awful combination of fear guilt and shame
this is wrong
its like we cheated
beat but dad you cant go back
you didnt die in that fire
and no matter what you do nothing is gonna change that
so all we can do is deal with this
and try to make it right
i dont think i can
im not a cop
i cant stop this guy
but we can we can do it together
spirit and guts remember
johnny i know but
frank starts to light up a lucky
but he stops stubbing the cigarette out
i need you to believe in me
to believe that we can do this
john hes got my drivers license
he took my drivers license john he knows where we live
he took your wallet
no he tossed the wallet but he kept the license
he touched your wallet
wheres your wallet
in my pocket
we got him
dad you got him
youve got his prints
ill run them through criminal index
you gotta get me that wallet
how the hell am i gonna do that
thinks listen to me very carefully take your wallet out just touch it on the corners
please dad just do it
frank does as john asks
taking out his wallet
i got it
right now i need you to tape it up on the outside where he touched it so the prints keep
then you gotta hide it somewhere
somewhere where nobodys gonna find it
looking around the room put it under the loose floorboard by the window
getting it now i gotcha i gotcha chief
its gonna work dad
were gonna stop him
frank fishes around the desk drawer for some electrical tape
quickly ripping off strips of tape
covering the wallet
then he goes to the window
crouches on the floor digging his nails around edges of the loose floorboard
over the ham okay
john scrambles to window
crouches down on floor reaching to find franks wallet covered in electrical tape
john goes back to the radio
were in business
just sit tight
and dont worry
and john is up grabs gun shield
sprints for the door
the right screen freezes
a thumb print
pull back to reveal john standing over a forensic computer technician hector
hector hits a few more keys a photograph pops on the screen it is not daryl adams
what the hell
hector hits another key the mans name and photo pops up
hes years older than when he tangled with frank in the mens room last night but this is the killer carl shepard
below shepards photo various biographical information social security address current employment and a new york city police department discharge september
a strange look of recognition
the old neighbors son
but hes dead
what are you talkin about
i know this prick
he worked outta brooklyn north
realizing he never died
john exits his car to find fred shepard watering his plants
just came by to wrap up over there
thought id say hello
glad you did
come on in
buy you a cup of coffee
they enter the living room
johns eyes fix on the police academy graduation photo of carl shepard
his gaze then shifts to photos of mrs
beat wife around
a startled half laugh no
well sort of
in my heart
been dead years
well she eve was murdered detective
an ugly one to tell you the truth
johns breath catches
his look shifts back to the photo of carl shepard
shepard reaches to open an album
there are several photographs of the young mrs
a couple where she is dressed in a nurses uniform
john is stunned
one can only imagine what is now racing through his mind
the mother of a cop and they never found the bastard who did it
blown away john looks out the window to where mary finellis skeleton was found
happens that way sometimes
beat son still on the job
got caught up in them knapp hearings
set up by some dirty cops who needed a fall guy
hurt him bad
wouldve broken his mothers heart
john can only stay inside himself and wonder at the madness of the world
john walks past the lunchtime crowd makes his way to the bar
grabs a stool two
seats away from
john orders a soda glances over at shepard
their eyes meet
john holds his gaze
a slight nod
you used to be on the job
yeah long time ago
i know you
i look familiar
looking him over no
what house you work
john gets up slides next to shepard
a hot shot huh
nah just working the job
i hear that
as a matter of fact i caught a case that goes back to your day
one of the nightingale murders
disappeared thirty years ago
found her bones last week
buried behind some old diner up by dyckman street
john waits again for shepards reaction
sipping drink talk about dumb luck
odds of anybody finding that girl thirty years later
and then the chances of hitting a dental
forget about it
bets part is shes the first victim
she knew the doer
im betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking
shepard says nothing but his eyes are burning into john
the past is a funny thing
weve all got skeletons in the closet
you just never know when theyre gonna pop up and bite you in the ass carl
john slips something on the bar next to shepard
it is a crime scene photo of shepards murdered mother
he reels back totally losing his veil of composure
he is freaked
who are you
im the train wreck you didnt see coming
and im gonna steal your life away
you went down years ago
you just dont know it yet
and with that john gets up leaving shepard stunned
johnny and gordo sit cross legged in front of the tv
the world series is on
julia is busy bringing in groceries from her car
youre telling me this maniac is a cop
what the hell am i supposed to do with that one
call the fbi
use a pay phone
dont give em your name dad
just tell em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others
that hes the nightingale
in the b
of franks house a doorbell rings
julia can be seen going to answer it
it is satch
there are ad lib greetings that we dont clearly hear
tell them where finellis body is buried
theyll be able to connect him to her
same high school
im betting they search his place they find some souvenirs
satch steps into the study
okay im on it
sees satch hey
franks hand lifts off the squawk bar
he notes satchs tone and demeanor
what are you doing here satch
you off today
over the ham dad you there
frank we need to talk
into radio john hold on a second
to satch im in the middle of something important here
you mind if
frank suddenly spots something through the front window
satchs partner phil hayes and two uniforms out at the curb
half a penny drops
all his senses go on alert
and instinct kicks
he hits the squawk bar
satch you gotta just give me
satch is here john
you hear me
satch is here
im sorry frank but you need to come outside
frank releases the squawk bar
johnny and gordo remain fixed on the game oblivious to anything else
in the kitchen we can see julia moving around putting away the groceries
over the ham dad what the hell is going on
into mic just a minute john
dont go away
julia now becomes aware of the tension in the voices in the other room
she looks outside and sees phil and the uniforms
she looks at frank and satch with confusion
frank hits the squawk bar again
he wants john to hear this
what is going on here satch
what are those guys doing out there
i think you know frank
no i dont
lets go outside and talk
we need to do that
do us both a favor
a long beat
frank sees julia staring at them
she is now a bundle of growing anxiety
frank stands up
to julia its okay bud
ill be right back
into radio stay there john
and then he and satch walk out the front door
and towards a spot halfway between the house and the cops
from inside the house johnny and gordo have begun to take in the activity
where were you last night frank
the rest of the penny drops
frank stalls trying to think what do you mean
do you know where i found this
and he hands frank his missing drivers license
frank looks like a truck hit him
under the body of a murdered woman
this isnt what you think
i wanna be wrong here
but we need to go to the precinct and talk about it
i need to go say something to julia and finish up with the guy on the radio
you can talk to julia
forget the radio
takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads back into the house
julia who has been watching through a front room window with johnny moves to meet frank
behind frank satch signals phil and the uniforms that all is okay giving frank a couple of steps on him
frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around julia turning so he can see both satch outside and where he wants to go inside
trust me bud
do that for me
frank moves julia toward teh desk lulling satch a moment then quickly steps to the ham radio and hits the squawk bar
john you there
over the ham yeah dad
what the hell is going on
satch is busting me for sissy clarks murder
julia stares dumbfounded at frank
satch strides by julia and reaches to take franks elbow
frank wheels at the sound of his name and the touch and he lurches back from satch
you gotta help me chief
and the movement yanks the mic cord to the radio tight dragging it to the edge of the desk
johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother
thats not the deal frank
dont do this to your family
and frank throws his hands up in front of his chest in an i give up gesture
whats going on
and the ham radio crashes to the floor in
the ham radio transforming
a large dent appearing in its casing before johns eyes
dread creeps into johns face as we smash cut to we see what john sees in
but we also go inside his mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories
memories of seeing his father arrested for murder
images that match johnnys pov from moments ago in
frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor satch sits across
two cups of coffee on the table
the room is very bare
cinder block walls
padded locks and bars over the windows
a small metal cabinet against the far wall
satch and phil smoke
frank does not
detective out of the th precinct
satch stares at frank with utter incredulity
phil lights a smoke tossing the pack and the matchbook on the table
i swear satch
beat uh huh
and you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when i came in
as nuts as that sounds yes
satch would you listen to me here
just you and me
can i talk to you here alone
satch looks over at phil
give me a little time with this guy
phil nods his understanding steps out of the room
frank this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl
hes not gonna stop satch
hes gonna keep on
are you listening to me
youre in a world of shit
an eye witness has you outside the dead girls apartment
we got your prints all over the place
plus the fucking drivers license frank
beat you gotta give me something here
something i can believe
its quiet for a moment
and then a sound filters in under the door
the sound of cops cheering
its the world series
frank sits up takes a beat
what if i could prove it to you satch
what if i told you that in the bottom of the th were gonna be down
and cleon jones is gonna get hit in the foot
its gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball
the next batter clendenon hits one outta the park
frank this is insane
in the bottom of the th weis is gonna hit a solo home run
jones and swoboda are gonna score in the th
the mets are gonna win
beat go watch the game satch

go watch the fucking game
frank theyre gonna make you for sissy clarks murderer
it matches the nightingales profile
you understand what that means
we hear the bolt slide the knob turns and the door opens
his wife is here
she wants to talk to you
satch nods okay to phil
he closes the door
whatta you want me to tell her
frank struggles for an answer
but comes up speechless
satch looks like his heart is breaking
unable to comprehend how frank could have slipped this far
a long beat then
shes in harms way
hes gonna be coming for her
satch snorts incredulous
frank reaches over the table and takes his hand deadly serious
promise me as a friend
october dont let her out of your sight
satch nods okay
they have an understanding
satch walks down the stairs
julia alone on the bench
she sees satch approaching stands up looking at him for an answer for an explanation
after a beat lets walk get a cup of coffee
julia nods okay
they exit the precinct house and into
around the corner we catch sight of someone familiar someone julia and satch dont recognize shepard
shepard approaches the desk flashes his shield at sergeant
you got a collar in here for the nightingale murders
im working with one of the victims outta brooklyn north
you mind i take a shot at him
thats deleon and hayes collar
just missed deleon
hayes is up in the squad
wheres the collar in the cells
no i think hes up in interrogation
ill go find hayes
shepard turns gliding through the lobby like a shark
satch and julia sit at a booth in the back
satch stirs his coffee trying to start a very hard conversation
as he struggles to begin the camera notices something in the b
at the counter a few stray people gathered around watching the world series on an old tv
shepard passes the coffee room
it is packed with detectives gathered around a tv
watching the game
phil hayes is among them
and as shepard passes phil half catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and enters
frank looks up to see shepard who quickly closes the door behind him
and unholsters his gun
an eerie moment
on your feet
frank waits a beat
then very slowly he stands
now turn around face the wall
frank steps back slowly turning
shepard holsters the gun
kicks frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the peppermint lounge bathroom
he coils it around his hands
how did you know
frank is trembling
facing the wall you twisted animal
evidence says youre the animal
snapping garrote tight thats why you hung yourself
but frank turns
you try putting that thing around my neck and ill rip your throat out
you want me dead use the gun
shepard smiles unfazed
let me draw you a picture
you live at st ave
you have a wife who works at new york hospital
and a six year old at p
shepard gives frank a look that would make a marine drill sergeant shit his pants
shepard knows franks weakness the one thing that would make him submit to death
closing his eyes frank turns to face the wall
but the door handle rattles someone is outside coming in
shepard quickly yanks frank away from the wall shoving him in a chair at the interrogation table
the door opens
what the hell is going on here
you got to help me
hes trying to kill me
shepard just laughs
phil scans the room everything looks normal a cop questioning a perp
mind if we take it outside
phil shrugs okay
to frank ill be right back
shepard and phil step out bolting the door behind them
shepard and phil stand outside the door
didnt mean t step on your toes
they sent me up from downstairs i thought youd be in there with him
what are you looking at him for
franks expression begins to harden
his eyes search teh room
close on his eyes
he looks like john controlled rage piercing through that sullivan thousand yard stare
he stands turning around looking for something anything that he can use to get the hell out of there
his minds racing fire fighter training kicking in
and then he looks up just below the ceiling above the door a follow franks eyes to something else
an air conditioner frank goes to the window
runs his fingers along the air conditioners thick electrical cord thinking
he unplugs it
and then he rips cord out of the unit exposing wire
a loud cheer rises out of the coffee room the game is heating up
shepard and phil are still standing outside the interrogation room
shepard flashes a smile having said something that makes phil laugh
yeah half the uniforms are either at the game or on the street
its gonna be a riot if they pull it off
glancing down the hall in direction of sound of tv whats the score
satch has no words to comfort her now way of explaining any of this
he reaches out across the table
taking her hand
and as they sit quietly
camera tracks towards the counter
and we hear something that satch does not
the sound of a voice
cleon jones thinks hes hit
i think the ball hit him in the foot
frank uses the heel of his shoe to rip the plug off the other end of the electrical cord
both ends now have exposed wires
close on a match
pull back to reveal shepard lighting phils cigarette then one for himself
they are inside the squads coffee room now
all eyes on the tv hadges is coming outta the dug out
hes calling for the ball
can we get a shot of the ball
shepard inhales deeply sneaking a glance down hall at the closed interrogation room door
satch looks past julia distracted curious
can you excuse me for a second
julia seems bewildered as satch gets up out of the booth making his way through the restaurant and towards the tv
frank in full throttle drags a chair against the wall
climbs on the chair uses a dime to unscrew the electrical he then unscrews the master fuse and shoves one end of the after re tightening the fuse and careful
not to touch the other end of the cord he jumps off the chair
someones walking down the hall
wall to wall cops
mesmerized by the game especially phil
theres a scuff mark on the ball
the umpire has reversed his decision
hes sending jones to first base
the cops erupt
yelling over the noise you mind i go back at teh fire boy for a while
i wont lay a hand on him just want to see what hes got
go ahead knock yourself out
shepard gives phil one last smile then slips out casually heading down the hall
towards the interrogation room
frank sweating bullets now takes the two coffee cups off the table and pours their contents on the floor
the coffee forms a small puddle which frank is careful not to let slip over the door saddle
he puts the cups down
then opens the cabinet rifling through finding a can of lysol spray
sounds of cops cheering filter in under the door
satch is riveted to the tv as clendenon steps up to the plate
satch jumps julia has come up behind him touching him on the shoulder
she looks mad how the hell can he be watching the ball game at a time like this
whats going on satch
dumbfounded i dont know
all eyes on the tv
another strike to clendenon
the door knob turns
the door half opens
shepard sticks his head in scanning the room
he relaxes a bit when he sees frank sitting quietly at the table
shepard opens the door a little further takes a half step into the room
and into the puddle of coffee
frank raises his arm
hes holding the live electrical cord
shepard what the fuck
frank flicks the cord
which lands like a snake at shepards feet
in the puddle of coffee
volts surge through shepards body
close on tv
clendenon still up
the wind up
but something is wrong with the tv
a spark shoots out of the back of the set
and then the entire th precinct goes dark
frank has shorted out the electrical system
the cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion
frank lunges over the table smashing a wooden chair over shepards head
hes in overdrive
kicking the still live cord out of the coffee puddle he then drags shepards body into the room shutting the door
frank quickly rips off shepards sports jacket pocketing shepards wallet and badge
and then moving very fast frank grabs the lysol can and the matches phil left on the table
he lights a match and holds it in front of the lysol can
he points the can at the ceiling at the fire alarm sensors
hits spray button professional fire fighter ingenuity homeade blow torch
fire alarms sound off
sprinkler system kicks in water gushing from the ceiling
cops begin to move investigating
frank cracks open the door and slips out
as the door closes shepards eyes pop open
sprinklers rain down on frank as he moves down the hall
through the darkness he can see someone coming
frank covers his face
searching for a place to disappear
all eyes on the tv
the count is now
the pitch is a high fastball
clendenon takes a massive swing
he nails it
the coffee shop breaks into cheers
everyone screaming their heads off
everyone except satch who just stands there in complete and utter shock
julia looking at him questioningly
yelling over the madness he was right
everything he said
he was telling the truth
then you believe him
yeah i do
you bet your life i do
and they hug
the weight of the world sliding off julias shoulders
but someone is trying to get satchs attention
it is the counter man hes holding a phone
satch takes the phone beat his face goes ashen
im on my way
he drops the phone heading for the door
to julia wait here ill send a uniform
and satch is gone
power is still off
sprinklers still gushing
amidst the chaos a bathroom door swings open
a man steps out
leather jacket gold shield
he slips through the madness heading down the hall and towards the stairs
satch races down the crowded block
dodging celebrating mets fans
bolting up the precinct steps into the house
phil runs in
scanning the room
but it is empty
just a puddle of coffee on the floor
satch charges into the lobby
the lights start to flicker back on
chaos giving way to order
satch heads for the stairs
and there is frank wearing shepards jacket and shield
but in his hurry satch has not spotted him
frank quickly steps behind a pillar as satch tears by him and up the stairs
stay with frank as he turns
calmly walking by the sergeants desk gliding out the precinct door and
disappearing into the street
little smile elvis has left the building
john stalks down an apartment building hallway gun drawn
he reaches a door
two locks and a bell
john smashes his bulk into the door
it bursts off its hinges
john charges in
place is empty
like somebody got the hell out in a hurry
a few odds and ends left behind in the haste
including a pile of unpaid bills
johns eyes glaze over in rage and fury
but then he sees something that makes him stop and think
there is a telephone on the floor in a corner
john stares at the phone wheels spinning
he reaches in his coat and takes out his notebook
flipping through pages
notes on shepard social security address dmv registration and a series of phone numbers
home office cellular
john runs to the phone
punches in the cell number
over phone hell you have the right to remain silent
if you give up that right
shepard is in his car over a bridge on the run
who the fuck is this
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
you have the right to speak to an att fuck you asshole
its a small world carl
and im gonna find you
click click dead bolt turning
front door opens and shepard walks in
his apartment is far nicer than the place we just left john in
shepard runs to the bathroom
rips off the toilets tank lid reaches down and pulls out a
magnum colt python wrapped in clear plastic
he rips off the plastic shoves the pistol in his waistband heads into the kitchen
he gropes behind the refrigerator close on an envelope glass taped to back of the fridge
shepards hand finds the envelope
he rips it loose
and then he opens it revealing its contents souvenirs polaroid photos of the shepard takes out a match to burn the photos
the broom closet door bursts off its hinges
frank instantly on top of shepard
the souvenirs go flying in the air
frank pummels shepards head and back
but shepard smashes his elbow in franks adams apple lands a solid uppercut square on franks nose
franks eyes watering up vision franks hand groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop the kitchen counter
shepard reaches for his gun points the
at franks head
shepards finger squeezing the trigger
frank smashes the glass pitcher down on shepards skull
crack the gun fires blasting air
frank scrambles for the window
hes outta there expertly thundering down fire escape
frank hits the pavement twisting his ankle
hears metal rattling looks up
shepards clattering down after him
shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid
the shot ricochets wildly
frank takes off limping and staying close to the building out of the line of fire
the streets are still empty the city glued to their tvs
frank hits cpw
he glances left right straight ahead
frank runs into the park
the door is kicked open
satch and phil enter guns drawn
they take in the damage from the fight
following the trail of blood back to the kitchen
and there strewn across the floor are shepards photos of his victims the newspaper clippings the jewelry and the envelope with the glass tape still on it
frank hears pounding footsteps shepard is catching up
franks adrenaline kicking in sprints around a bend in the path reaches long wooden bridge spanning central park lake
the bridge is being restored
barricades across the entrance
frank hurdles over the barricades runs onto the bridge
shepard trips in the dirt
gets back up reaches the bridge knocks over a barricade runs to the middle of the bridge
shepard stops listens nothing
frank dangles below the bridge holding onto the steel girder of substructure ft
not moving a muscle not making a sound barely even breathing
crawling on franks arm
caught off guard frank flinches sending the rat tumbling
bridge side railings have been removed for construction
shepard hears something hit the water
rushes to the side of the bridge points his gun at the water
shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water
shepards outstretched arm only a few feet from franks head
frank silently swings his body forward reaching out
snags shepards arm pulling him hard over the side
shepard falls grabs for something anything
wraps his arms around franks leg hangs on tight
frank struggles kicks wildly trying to shake shepard off
shepard hangs on with his left arm
pulls out the gun with his right
he aims it at franks head
cocks back the hammer
frank lets go
they plunge into murky water thick with dirt and slime deep
franks hanging on to shepards arm trying to wrestle the gun free
but shepards using his free hand to gouge franks eyes
frank bites down hard on shepards wrist
the gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom
but shepard gets both hands on franks throat
shoving his head into the shallow water
shepards grip is like a vise frank futilely tries to pry shepards fingers open
frank is blinded by polluted water
starting to lose consciousness
desperately he searches the muddy lake bottom for the gun
but hes getting weaker fading out
then he feels something
a brick fallen off the bridge half buried in the mud
frank struggles to dig it up
summons his last ounces of strength yanking it back and forth its getting loose
but shepards hands are squeezing tighter
frank finally goes limp
a few last bubbles float to the surface
catching his breath slightly loosens grip on franks lifeless neck
frank springs off the lake bottom rises out of the water like a jack in the box
holding the brick with both hands he swings
the brick smashes against shepards head
knocking him to yesterday
he drops like a rock
frank waits for shepard to come up for air
frank crawls out of the water collapsing onto the embankment
he just lies there heart pounding chest heaving
and suddenly frank is startled by a massive roar the sound of eight million new yorkers screaming in unison
the mets have just won the world series
frank laughs slowly getting to his feet
franks dripping blood and filthy lake water
the streets have instantly erupted with celebrating mets fans
a giant party
cars whiz by honking their horns passengers leaning out pumping fists in victory
frank has to yell above the racket
over phone th precinct
over phone hold on
the nightingale evidence from shepards kitchen floor is spread all over the squad room
satch you gotta listen to me
we know its shepard
im on the corner of th and cpw
come get me
frank clicks down the receiver slides in a dime dials another number
a beat then
over phone hello
frank smiles and we dissolve to the area cordoned off
detectives and uniforms
an inflatable boat is being placed in the lake
two police frog men are climbing into their gear
pan over the scene to find frank and satch
franks got a blanket wrapped around him
they talk quietly as satch walks frank to a waiting green and white squad car
you missed a hell of a game frank
next time lets put some money on it
to the uniform driver get him home safe
satch sticks out his hand
frank takes it
they hold each others grip for some moments
frank starts to say thank you but satch silently cuts him off
frank climbs in the car
satch closes the door taps on the roof frank is on his way home
johnny is asleep in bed
elvis sleeps at the foot of it
in the shadows next to them julia sits very still in a rocking chair half asleep half awake
staring out the window
her eyes are bloodshot
she has been through hell
a faint stairway creak
he looks up to see frank standing in the doorway
he looks a wreck
and she is out of the chair
they meet in a hug
over her shoulder frank takes a long look at his sleeping son
relatively cleaned up but very bruised frank is at the desk trying to repair the disassmbled radio
julia comes in and sets down a cup of coffee
she kisses him on the top of his head casts a wondering eye on the radio and leaves
john pulls into the driveway and stops
he stares out the window exhausted
and then something catches his attention
coming from inside the house
the ham radio
he bolts from the car runs to the door scrambles to get the backdoor key into the lock as over the ham john john
john barrels into the kitchen leaving door ajar and runs
john hits the squawk bar on the ham which
im here dad
we did it john
we stopped him
a short pause john looks confused
he sits down
i dont remember
why dont i remember
close on frank the back of his skull smashed by the butt of a
wielded by carl shepard
frank hits the floor with a thud shepard looming over him reaching for a set of handcuffs
the butt of a
smashes the back of johns skull
he tumbles to the floor
fighting to stay conscious
carl shepard stands over him the gun pointing at his head
my turn to steal your life
shepard stands over frank
frank tires to struggle up
shepard forces him back down tromping a boot into his chest
youre a clever fuck fireboy
and he snaps a handcuff on one of franks wrists then wrenches him to a steel radiator in the family room where he circles the pipe to the floor with
the handcuff chain and attaches the other cuff to franks other wrist
john is woozy
he reaches down to his holster it is empty
shepard has got johns mm in his left hand
to johns head shepard pops the clip out of the mm and tosses it aside
he then snaps a handcuff around johns wrist begins dragging him to the radiator
johns foot erupts up into shepards groin
goes flying across the room
for a suspended moment both men are riveted to the
spinning on the floor
frank struggling to breathe is slumped by the radiator staring up at shepards groin
goes flying across the room
for a suspended moment both men are riveted to the
spinning on the floor
frank struggling to breathe is slumped by the radiator staring up at shepard who is staring back with pure menace
the sound of a shower can be heard upstairs
shepard looks up
time to meet the family
struggling to breathe this is between you and me
not any more
julia luxuriates in a steaming shower
a brutal struggle for the gun between john and shepard
frank desperately tugs at the handcuffs
steel bites down on his wrists
julia smiles as she sees a figure through the curtain
want to join me
and the shower curtain flies open to reveal shepard
julia lets out a bloodcurling scream and plasters herself against the shower wall
frank reacts to the scream and tears with everything he has in him to rip away from the radiator
johnny stirs awake at the sound of the scream
john and shepard are in a desperate tug of war over the gun
they kick viciously at each other
but john is still woozy from the head wound and shepard is still very strong
the gun goes off
julia is paralyzed against the wall
staring into the dead as marble eyes of shepard
he looks her up and down
franks wrists are bleeding
he cant get out
but then he sees something
something he can use
frank struggles to unfasten the watch strap
he does it
he pinches the metal clasp with his thumb and forefinger and guides it to the keyhole in the left handcuff
he works it
john shepard fight furiously
but john has managed to get control of the
he squeezes it
shepards hands are moving towards julias breasts
suddenly she lashes out digging her nails deep into shepards close on shepard struggling with john
a large scar etches onto his face in the exact spot where julia dug her nails in years ago
shepard grabs julia by the throat
slams her against the wall knocking her unconscious onto the shower floor
he touches the gash on his face stares at the blood
john keeps squeezing that trigger
no more bullets
shepard lets go of the gun heave john over and grabs him by the neck
shepard is on top of julia in the shower
he uncoils the garrote snaps it taut and starts around her neck
and then a sound
beyond adequate description
but once youve heard it you dont forget it
shepards head spins about
get your fucking hands off my wife
dont do it frank
youre not a killer
he is right
shepard lunges grabbing the shotgun barrel
buckshot rips through the air
shepards right hand explodes
blood spattering everywhere
like a wounded animal shepard bolts blowing past frank
frank gently wraps julia in a towel
the fading sound of shepard thundering down the stairs
out the door
and then softer footsteps
johnny appears in the doorway
safe and sound
john starts to choke back to life
and then something happens
some kind of shock wave ripples through the house bending light bizarrely distorting everything in its path including shepard and john
the shock wave is over
but the house is different
shepard scans the changed room disoriented bewildered
pounding blows to shepards head
john is on top of shepard hands on his neck
as john squeezes the life out of him shepard struggles to reach down his leg with his good hand
theres something down there
an ankle holster
shepard strains to get his hand on the gun
in a flash shepard has the gun to johns temple
shepard cocks back the hammer
you were the kid
i remember now
keeping the gun pressed against johns temple shepard gets to his feet
but this time no daddy
john closes his eyes
its over he knows hes gonna die
then a sound
a sound weve heard before
a sound you never forget
music to our ears
shepard looks up to see man holding shotgun
b o o o m shotgun blast buckshot ripping into shepard
impact lifting him off his feet
he lands dead on the floor
opening his eyes
looking up at the doorway
blinking through shotgun smoke trying to focus
not believing what he sees
john looks up at his father speechless
im still here chief
we are soaring high above a baseball diamond
clear light air you can see for miles
float down to the field
the first taste of spring and softball
the bleachers filled with families and loved ones
among them sits samantha
shes smiling shes glowing
pull back to reveal satch gordo ellen gordy jr
a dalmation puppy scampers at their feet barking in recognition as
frank sullivan steps into the batters box
pitcher year old african amerasian a muscular beanpole
embroidered on the back of the his fdny jersey is his nickname phire power
quick shot of first baseman
graham gibson once a nervous probie now a seasoned vet
and one hell of proud father
to pitcher take it easy on him son hes older than moses
frank sneers at gib then glances up at gibs wife in the bleachers
she looks familiar its the girl frank saved in the warehouse years ago
phire power twirls his arm
frank takes a big swing
the ball fouls back behind the plate
towards the parking lot
where among the old chevys and fords sits a brand new mercedes
the custom license plate reads yahoo
franks foul ball comes down hard
as the mercedes windshield spiderwebs we hear an off camera scream
it is gordo jumping up running across the field
from the parking lot his eyes meet franks
an im sorry shrug and frank turns his attention back to the game
the next pitch is high and outside
frank takes a looping swing
driving the ball to the gap in right center
frank jogs to first
an easy single
from first frank glances over at the third base coach julia
her hair pinned up under a mets cap julia puts two fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as
the next batter steps out of the dugout
it is john sullivan
john as he makes his way to the plate
check out his eyes theyre different he looks like his father
theyve got that frank sullivan sparkle
john steps into the batters box cocks back to wood
bring me home son
bring me home
phire power uncorks the fastest softball pitch youve ever seen
john jumps on it
rips a massive shot to deep center way over the fence
the crew in the stands are on their feet cheering
frank rounds third john catches up
a double high five from julia and they jog home together
the game is over
frank puts his arm around john
heading for the bleachers
a little boy totters up to them
jumping into johns arms
his name is frank jr
hey there chief
john gives his son a kiss glances up at samantha in the bleachers
they share a smile
and as they step off the field his little boy reaches up takes johns hat off his head and puts it on his own
elvis has left the building
in his eyes bliss
cue bruce springsteens take me out to the ballgame
archival film footage
the last pitch
shea stadium erupts
fans stream onto the field
lifting the players on their heads
the madness continues for a while then slowly fade to fifth ave
mets ticker tape parade
its a hell of a party
