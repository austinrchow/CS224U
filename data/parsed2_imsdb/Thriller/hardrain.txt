screenplay by graham yost falls from low grey clouds
down below we see
muddy slow and powerful overflowing its banks
in the near distance is
filled to the maximum water thundering out of two open gates
we close in on
theres a dam control office in the middle of the dam
we move off the reservoir and head out over
we see no fear spelled out in stones on one mans roof
we go down and into
storefronts are sandbagged and closed
a sign on one store reads gone fishing
a sign on another hey looter
nothing of value here
try next door
and on the next store hes beautiful old ringed with a five foot high wall of sandbags
the floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags
loaded down are heading out of town on streets covered in the first water of the flood
on an island in the middle of the street
its civil war era of a general on a horse sword held high
the floodwater is over the curb lapping at the base of statues pedestal
near the statue stands
s with soft edges and friendly eyes
hes talking into his radio mike
so are we all going to die
hank the dam control officer is on the radio with the sheriff

wayne and phil two deputies s are near the sheriff shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed
i think my best was when i turned twelve
my dad set up a treasure hunt
it was really cool
off waynes disdainful look well it was
wayne shrugs a whatever and pulls a sandbag up out of the water
theres unpleasant looking muck all over his arms
he drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the crud with disgust

nervous assistant bank manager wellman is hurriedly tossing stacks of money into two canvas bags
washes up on wellman
do you think you could go a little faster pal
i im going as fast as i can
well its not fast enough
wellman is about to speak then sees something gulps
is held by one of the men pointed at the floor
sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags
we dont keep any of our ignore wellman grab the canvas bags and stride off
close on the lower half of the front doors as they fly open
out come two men in long dark raincoats
runs up stopping in the open door
as they slowly turn to face wellman
we just see their faces shielded from the rain by hat brims
tom handsome with an easy smile
charlie with a tough red face
looks nervous for a second then holds up a clipboard
you forgot to sign
we see for the first time by their hats and uniforms that they are armored car drivers
theres an armored car parked at the curb on the other side of a low wall of sandbags
charlie sighs goes back to wellman and perfunctorily signs the form
then he and tom go to the sandbag wall
tom holds both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other
charlie doesnt want to get wet
he steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the truck then keys open the doors
charlie reaches out for the money bags
tom jumps off the sandbag wall and lands in the water splashing charlie
its a flood charlie
youre gonna get wet
charlie takes the bags tosses them in then shuts the back
he moves toward the front still trying to keep out of the water
tom splashes him some more
do you know what kind of crap is in that water
of course he knows well yeah
tom kicks some more water at charlie
charlie gives tom a withering look and climbs in the truck
charlie gets into the drivers seat tom climbs into the shotgun seat
they shut and bolt the doors
charlie gets on the radio
dispatch this is

well be back in an hour

over and out
charlie hangs up the radio
he starts writing on a clipboard
silence for a few moments and then charlie notices tom staring at him
what about my ear

youre gonna need somebody to go in there with a weed whacker
charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to tom
youre offering me one of your donuts
i dont know what to say
im getting all misty
if itll shut your mouth you can have the whole bag
charlie starts the truck
tom thinks about it then tosses the bag back
i start eating donuts and ill never get out of this truck
disgusted i love how you think youre better than this

theres a lot to like about this job and i dont just mean the dashing polyester ensemble and the solid three figure income
angry you ungrateful shit
i dont believe you

charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat

thirty years old and all the crap you pulled and you never got caught
angry that wasnt luck old man
that was skill
i was good at it

i didnt say that
yeah building a home raising a family thats just stupid
i didnt say that

charlie puts the truck in gear starts off
tom looks at charlie shakes his head what was that about
writing letters in a crossword puzzle

late s with a creased face and piercing eyes
hes sitting at the bar drinking coffee
rain sheets down outside
the bartender watches tv sound off
next to jim at the bar are
ray s has lank hair rheumy eyes and a glass of irish whisky in front of him
kenny s long hair has the energy of a puppy unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a puppy
s looks like and was a high school teacher
sound off a man is crying about what he has lost in the flood
thus saith the lord behold waters shall rise up out of the north and be an overflowing flood and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl
ray takes a drink
kenny leans over to ray sotto
youre gonna be able to buy a helluva lot of bibles huh ray

jim leans over to kenny

jim slides the newspaper in front of kenny
i dont do crossword puzzles
ill take a look jim
kenny can read
to kenny just look at it
you know when you write down a word and suddenly it looks all wrong
maybe its right but it doesnt look right
jim points at the newspaper
thirty one across
kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper
mumbles as he reads mention money again and
his eyes go wide
in an uncompleted part of the puzzle jim has written a message in the boxes
it reads mention money and ill kill kenny looks up at jim
jim glances over at the bartender then back at kenny
did i get it right
you got it right
charlie and tom continue to drive in silence
they both sneak looks at each other
their eyes meet for a second then they look away
a moments pause then
a hint of a smile on both of them
tom reaches for charlie
give us a kiss
charlie goes red in the face pushes tom away
get out of here
laughs beat you really are a cranky old fart you know that
what was that about

i dont know i

i want to get back
you know i really do appreciate what youve done for me
this is a good job
no its not
its putting your life on the line for someone elses money
looking away from town the high school is on the left
on the right is the cemetery
farther on on the left is a car and boat dealership
the road is covered in water
goes by the entrance to the high school water shooting up from the wheels pushing out in a wide wake
tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water
wheres the road
stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the telephone poles a few feet above the rippling surface of the floodwater
beat look tom i dont care what it is you end up doing
oh god here we go again
this is the last time i swear
tom sees something ahead
he doesnt understand at first
the reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than the others
no reflector bars for a hundred yards then they resume
looks at tom i just think whatever it is you do its time you did some heavy lifting
tom figures out whats going on with the reflector bars
no you gotta hear this
youre better than stop the truck
were going down
the water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down
charlie stands on the brakes
a wave of water rushes forward from the truck then comes back and washes over the hood splashing up on the windshield
charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much power
they hear the rear wheels spinning underwater
charlie eases off the tires start to catch they start moving backwards
charlie and tom exchange a quick look of relief
and then the engine dies
charlie tries to restart it but theres nothing
its stopped on a downgrade its a dip in the road
the water is up to the top of the front tires up to the hubcaps on the rear wheels
the headlights are underwater spots of yellow glowing
theyve stopped next to a lighted sign
its a little dip in the road or something
you can see the reflectors come up the other side
curses to himself i knew this would happen
grabs radio mike ill see if theres anyone coming
maybe we can get pulled out
tom opens the door
charlie adjusts the radio frequency selection button clicks on
dispatch this is
over radio this is dispatch
into radio dispatch were stuck outside of huntingburg
where are you
were on headed for the interstate
right by a sign saying welcome to huntingburg
tom climbs out and up on top of the truck
tom stands on top of the truck
in one direction nothing but blackness
the other way he can see the lights of the town
but there are no cars coming
charlie looks over as tom appears upside down in the doorway
the towns been evacuated
we wont get any help from there
dispatch cant get anyone out
they are aware were carrying a shitload of money
they called the national guard
theyre gonna be here in about ninety minutes
nods into radio dispatch were gonna need help a little sooner than theres a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and interior lights and the headlights go out
looking out as the sheriffs car rolls past on the water covered street
a hand lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window
the sheriff motions wayne to stop the car then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone
into mike henry i saw you
come on out
no one comes out of the house
henry im not leaving until you come out
a few moments pass and then
late s step out onto their porch
christ henry i told you to stay away from the damn window
gets out of the car
what are you still doing here
were just were setting traps
thats illegal doreen
you gonna arrest us sheriff
hell are you even sheriff anymore sheriff
didnt you lose an election
i sure as hell know i didnt vote for you and neither did henry
you dont need to set traps
thats what they said in
when we got back anything the bastards didnt steal they broke just for the hell of it
thats not happening this time
damn right its not
you cant stay you know that
were going to my sisters
soon as we finish setting the traps
the sheriff wants to say something more but hes not about to argue with doreen
he just nods and gets back into the car
the sheriff climbs back in
he and wayne watch henry and doreen go back into the house doreen still nagging at henry
godll understand if you have to drown her in the basement henry
the sheriff sighs nods to wayne
wayne puts the car in gear
the water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck
we gotta get out of here
what about the money
the moneys safe were not
water rose about a foot in the last twenty minutes
the national guard isnt going to be here for another hour
you do the math
tom shrugs charlies right
theyre about to get out when light washes up on them
they look out to see
approaching on the other side of the dip a quarter mile away
look at each other then get out of the truck
stops on the far side of the dip a hundred yards away
the headlights shine across the water
doors open and men get out
come around the front of the truck
they cant see through the glare of the suburbans bright headlights
well see if we can get you out
well be right over
charlie looks at tom relieved
looks like we might just headlights go on high beam
squint blinded by the high beams
whyd they do that
probably so they can see better
or so we cant see at all
charlie looks at him what does he mean
tom puts his hand on his pistol
assembled by the suburban are
all holding guns
he speaks to them quietly
this is my retirement fund boys and if any one of you screws up i swear to god ill kill you
they start wading down into the dip in the road
kenny carries a rifle
tom squints through the bright light
company dispatch and the national guard are the only ones who know were here
anyone with a scanner from radio shack couldve intercepted your call charlie
to jim and men could you turn down your lights
were bringing a rope
turn down your lights
well be right there
tom starts to pull his gun
is fired up on adrenalin
he has his rifle up and is aiming it
tom with his hand on his pistol starting to pull it out
charlie sees tom going for his gun
he moves close to tom half in front of him putting his hand on toms
take it easy tom
squeezes the trigger of his rifle
jumps at the sound of the rifle crack
is knocked back
yanks out his gun and starts shooting back
duck down in the water
shooting blindly looks over and sees
a horrible look on his face blood coming out of his neck
he sinks into the water
shoots off another few quick rounds
drops into the water bullets plugging in around him
just his hand and pistol are visible shooting blindly back toward jim and his men
the suburban is hit by toms fire
runs out of bullets
a beat later we see charlie start moving through the water tom is pulling him
doesnt hear jim and keeps firing
aims his pistol at kennys head
tom comes up in the water behind the truck gasping holding charlie
tom rests his gun on the truck bumper
im sorry tom
jim glares at kenny his eyes on fire
he was going for his gun
he wasnt gonna shoot kenny
shakes head calls to tom we just want the money
get away and we wont have to kill you
shuts his eyes thinking scared
tom opens his eyes
he looks down at
floating in the water
what the hell is he going to do
jims men look at him
jim motions them to wait some more
you got thirty seconds to get the hell away
jim and the others wait but theres no answer from tom
the clocks running
still no response from tom
all they can see is the front of the truck in the light of the welcome sign
they cant see the back
jim nods to his men
they head for the truck down into the deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road
all have guns up and ready
jim sends mr
mehlor and ray out to circle around
they all move quietly
the only sound is the rain
gets to the truck and moves along its side kenny right behind him
jim gets to the back of the truck nods for kenny to cover him then steps out behind the truck gun up
tom is gone
is floating in the water eyes of glass
step into the circle of light thrown by the welcome sign
eyes charlie ah jesus
to kenny your dadd be real proud of you kenny
he was going for his gun
mehlor i believe were gonna need your science project
mehlor nods and digs into his pack
ray looks down at charlie in the water
i shall bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy all that lives under the heavens and every creature that has the breath of life in it shall perish
were you a preacher or something
ray did five years in the hole at joliet
the only thing you get to read in the hole is the bible
to ray you got religion
mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack
a half stick of dynamite with a timer mounted on a magnet
when you hit the switch youve got thirty seconds
you teach your students how to make things like that
mehlor puts the device on the back door
you been to a high school recently ray
my students taught me how to make things like that
jim touches the handle on the door
he raises his pistol grabs the door handle and pulls
the door swings open
we dont need to see what he sees we can tell from the expression on his face
tom is running hard through the knee deep water pulling a string of canvas money bags buckled together
the truck and welcome sign are two hundred yards behind him
tom hears an angry yell
kenny is the one yelling
the patter of the rain is too loud they cant hear anything
jim scans the horizon but sees nothing
now whyd he have to go and do a thing like that
to stay alive
off their looks he thinks well kill him unless he knows where the money is and we dont
there is another possibility
off their looks hes thinking of keeping it for himself
theres always that
either way we got ourselves a sharp one
what do we do
jim is looking at something in the distance
pretty soon the waterll be too deep for him to run
but for us itll be just deep enough
unclear deep enough for what
a glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat showroom
jim and his men stride in
kenny ogles a particularly nice cruiser
jim stops at a smallish ski boat
here we go
re cruiser what about this monster
re ski boat this is all we need
shit jim were stealing
cant we take anything we want
the water isnt very deep yet
we need something with a low draft
mehlor find us some gasoline
mehlor heads off
sees something else he likes
we dont see what it is
the name william portman is chiseled into a crypt
tom appears from underwater gasping for breath
he gets to his feet and trudges off through the water
tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery splashing through the knee deep water
hes running when he hears from behind him boat engines firing up
he turns to see
racing toward him over the water a hundred and fifty yards back
jim is steering the ski boat
mellor hunkers down beside him
we pull back to see
flanking the ski boat piloted by kenny and ray
tom is running as fast as he can
he looks back sees the ski boat and jet skis closing
theyll get him before he gets to town
he suddenly veers off the road toward
the sign out front reads go warriors
tom runs around the side of the high school
ride up on the ski boat and jet skis and round the corner
no sign of tom
cut your engines
the engines are shut down
they all drift
jim shines a flashlight over onto
theres a hole in a window large enough to climb through
tom wades through the classroom pushing floating desks aside
flashlight beams stab into the room
tom hurries to the hall
jim turns to his men
lets get him out
but for godsake whatever you do
with a hard look at kenny dont kill him
not until we find out where he hid that money
tom makes his way past banks of lockers trying to get as far as he can from the probing flashlight beams
kenny drifts up to the front doors
he pulls on them
reaches into his pack
tom tries lockers looking for a place to hide
kenny rides his jet ski fast away from the front doors and the doors explode
tom ducks down as
shoots over him
ride the jet skis into the flooded school
tom is swimming as hard as he can out of breath
kenny and ray goes off down a hall while kenny idles in the lobby
hears the gasp turns grinning
enemy sub off the port bow
gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall
he rounds a corner and keeps going
guns his engine and takes off after tom
runs another thirty feet then trips on something and goes down
comes around the corner grinning when he sees
halfway down the hall standing frozen caught in kennys light
guns it racing forward down the hall toward tom
full steam ahead
hits something underwater and stops
he flies through the air slams headfirst into a trophy case and drops into the water
stands up he was kneeling
low tide sailor
on the wall angles down into the water
underwater there are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the hall thats what the jet ski grounded on
ray motors down the hallway toward the corner
around the corner comes a jet ski
ray assumes its kenny
then the jet ski speeds up and shoots by him
ray sees its
wearing kennys hat and jacket
ray races after tom along the flooded hallways taking the turns fast
ray pulls a gun starts shooting
tearing through the halls flashlight lighting the way
bullets hit the walls ceiling water around him
comes around a corner sees the open front doors ahead of him
come into view in the ski boat blocking the exit
turns hard and speeds down a side hall
a wall of windows at the end
no way out
rises out of the water blood running down his face pistol up
is on his tail
makes his choice and guns the jet ski straight at kenny
fires misses and is knocked to the side as
hunches down on the jet ski and crashes through the windows
jim and mr
mehlor are moving right outside the windows just as tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark
tom moves fast over the water
he yanks off his clip on tie
chase toms light behind by fifty yards heading out into farm fields
they get closer and closer and then watch as
runs straight into a tree and explodes
race up to find the burning flaming wreckage of the jet ski
ray circles on the other jet ski
kenny still bleeding from the head is in the boat with jim and mr
laughing nice driving buttwipe
im glad youre enjoying this kenny but if hes dead how do we find the money
kenny reacts oh right
oh hes still alive
we see what jim sees
tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open
tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree watching the distant lights of jim and his men
the current carries tom away
jim scans the horizon sees nothing
ray im in need of a little inspiration
with a raging flood he makes an end of those who oppose him and pursues his enemies into darkness
from one of the more obscure sorry to interrupt bible study and all but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are
we should be back in the motel room counting out the money
instead jim lashes out with a fist hard and fast hitting kenny in the chest knocking him out of the ski boat into the water
kenny comes up in the thigh deep water sputtering
no one likes this particular turn of events kenny but we have a choice we can can either deal with it or we can walk away
theres a lot of money out there so i choose to deal with it
if you want to go thats fine start swimming
you want to stay thats fine too just stop your damn whining
jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski boat takes off leaving ray on the jet ski with kenny in the water
what the hells his problem
all the money in the world aint worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught
its not like there wont be other jobs
you may have more of these in you kenny but jim doesnt
ray pulls kenny up onto the jet ski and takes off after jim
the water level is creeping up a five foot high wall of sandbags
looking out over the top of the sandbag wall
a tree floats by on the water
suddenly appear on the top of the wall and
pulls himself into view
he climbs over the wall exhausted
gasoline powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater
the sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay
he hurries up the back steps and goes into the church
tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards
he goes through a door
tom comes out into the altar
he looks around impressed
its a beautiful church
scaffolding goes up one wall the church is being restored
tom is startled by a sound from above
he grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and looks up to see
fluttering up in the rafters
takes a breath
just as he relaxes he hears a whooshing sound from behind him and turns to see
being swung at his head
tom slowly regains consciousness blinking his eyes
what are you doing here
but the sheriff isnt asking tom hes asking
pretty even in head to toe rain gear
i was setting up pumps
i sure as hell dont get what you see in that church
i wouldnt expect you to wayne
whats that supposed to mean
karen did you think the order was for everyone but you to evacuate
i was gonna go as soon as i filled the pumps but the next thing i know ive got a looter on my hands

i think its great what you did
thats it phil
thatll finally get you into her pants
what if hed had a gun karen
a lot of these looters carry guns
im not a looter
sits up on a cot behind bars in the holding cell woozy
jim and his men are searching the school for the money
jim it could be anywhere
it might not even be in the school
the rain sheets down hard
a lightning flash reveals
the water is up to the horses knees
the lightning passes and a second later thunder rolls
the sheriff phil wayne and karen stand outside the cell
tom is inside on the cot
he touches the cut on his forehead
what were you doing at the church
i told you he was looting it
i just said im not a looter
to karen youre the one who nailed me
karen nods you got a better arm than my ex wife
what the hell did you hit me with a statue
i saw a flash of some guy coming at me
mumbles embarrassed it was a crucifix
to others it was the only thing there

look son what were you doing in the church
looking for a place to hide out
from who swamp thing
the bastards who killed my partner

we were driving an armored truck
the truck got stuck out past the high school
they mustve picked up our call to dispatch cause they knew where we were
charlie and i were just standing there and all hell broke loose
how much money did you have
a little over three million
they all exchange a look thats a lot of money
the bank was afraid of looters
they had us cleaning out their branches up and down the river
they stole three million dollars
no i dont think so
they all look at the sheriff
he looks at tom
you took the money didnt you
i hid it in the cemetery

what the helld you do that for
i dont like to carry around that much cash
jesus wayne use your head

the sheriff looks at tom is that it

the sheriff thinks for a beat then tosses some keys to phil

phil nods and goes to it
the sheriff opens a desk drawer pulls out an ankle holster

the sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster

the sheriff thwacks wayne in the ear
wayne whats the worst thats ever happened to you

dismisses wayne to tom smart move with the money
phil comes over with the guns
to phil wayne and ill check out the cemetery

nods at karen out of town
get her to some high ground then come on back
the sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster
i have to fill the pumps pulling her out not any more you dont
the sheriff straightens up grabs a rifle from phil and pulls karen to the door
wayne goes to toms cell door and pulls it shut with a click
he could still be lying
the sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for wayne to come along
he opens the door for karen wayne and phil to go through
sheriff they killed my partner without any warning
and theyre gonna regret that i guarantee you
theyre gonna regret coming anywhere near this town tonight
and out he goes
water is halfway up the four foot high wall of sandbags around the station
there are three outboard motorboats moored to the sandbags
phil take karens boat
the sheriff and wayne climb toward their boats
you can do it phil
the men of huntingburg are counting on you
just bite me
wayne laughs as he and the sheriff fire up their boat engines
tom hears boat engines start up and move away
he lays back down on the cot listening to the rain
light comes out from under the door to the bathroom
hank is on the can reading a copy of american survivalist magazine
an odd reaction comes over his face
he feels something weird
he looks down
water is seeping in under the door
the bathroom door flies open and hank waddles out pants around his feet
he shuffles fast to the control wheels and starts spinning them
two gates open fast all the way and water thunders out
hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio
the sheriff and wayne are motoring in their boats zooming through the trees engine noise obliterating anything coming in over the radio
on the radio sheriff come in
phil steers karens small boat down main street past the statue
the water is up to the riders stirrups
pleading did you see the stained glass windows phil
did you see what a good job they did
i cant let anything happen to the church not after all ive put into it
karen you know id do anything for you but the sheriff told me to get you out of town
its for your own good
karen stands up
whatre you doing
if youre not going to take me back to the church then ill swim
karen moves to get out of the boat
hey hold on
phil lets go of the throttle and stands moving toward karen
what am i saying
karen suddenly turns on phil and pushes him out of the boat
this is my boat
karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street
phil stands in the waist deep water and watches her go flabbergasted
karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the church
the water is swirling quietly still a good three feet below the top of the wall
close on the lighted welcome to huntingburg sign
theres a rushing sound and a two foot high wall of water hits the sign
the lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water rushes on
the sheriff and wayne are racing through a grove of half submerged trees
theres a rushing sound above the sound of the engines
and theyre hit by the wall of water
wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water
jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when
rushes down the alley
the water hits him hard knocking him off the jet ski
hes swept away by the water
the surge water shoots through it
and suddenly theres
slammed up against the fence pinned to it water rushing over and around and by him
he yells as the wire cuts into him
karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps
she hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits
water shoots over the top
tom hears the sound and opens his eyes what the hell is that
the wall of water slams in hard cascading over the sandbag wall
theres two feet of water in the station
the building is like a rock in a stream with the water rushing up high against one wall roiling and swirling around the sides
tom looks over stunned to see
the door as a fine stream spits in through the keyhole
are heaving as the water rises up against them
gets to his feet woozy and goes to get out of the cell
he remembers uh oh the cell door is locked
jim pulls ray coughing choking bleeding into the ski boat
the water level inside is rising fast
it hits the wall sockets and theres a spit of sparks then all the desk lamps go dark
light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels
laying on the sheriffs wooden desk
theyre four feet away too far to reach
karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops
she shakes it off doesnt want to think about it and mutters to herself
theyll get him out
phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below him
wayne gets back into his boat
the sheriff realizes something
you locked him in
tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in the water
the sheriffs desk lifts up starts floating
tom gets an idea
he takes his belt off
a telephone pole is half submerged being pulled along fast by the current
tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at
bobbing in the rising water
he misses the keys
tom tries again
the belt lands on the desk top
tom very gently starts pulling
too hard the belt starts slipping off the desk
he gets it just right and the desk starts moving toward tom
he reaches out with his hand stretching
touch the top of the desk start pulling it toward him and he just gets a firm grip on the desk when
smashes into a window bending in the bars on the window shattering the glass letting a torrent of water into the room
is moved by the rush of water but not before tom grabs
and grips them tight
tries the keys in the lock
they dont fit
he looks at them
the tag is emblazoned with the ford logo
i can drive out of here
tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at
rising very fast
a foot in ten seconds
climbs up the cell bars the water rising with him
hes running out of room between himself and the ceiling
hes being pushed up by the water toward
on the ceiling caged in a wire cover
is terrified about to die
the water rises up past his face
pull his maglite flashlight from his belt
he takes off the lens and the battery cap then shakes the batteries out
sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over the light fixture
he blows out the water like clearing a snorkel then breathes
reprieve for a few moments and then
reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle in when
in the darkness theres the sound of tubes breaking and metal being wrenched
looks up astonished to see
being lifted up and away from above
streetlight comes in silhouetting
standing on the roof
the figure leans down and starts tugging at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture
in the light tom sees that its
and shes pulling as hard as she can but the wire cage isnt budging
she pulls out a swiss army knife unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place
she gets two screws out
pulls on the cage and it swings down
he climbs up it
tom surfaces in a hole in the roof
theres a vent duct laying on the roof karen mustve kicked that over to get to the light fixture
karen helps tom up
she sits and he lays down on the roof catching his breath
i owed you for hitting you and all
but were even now okay
beat looks around what happened
i dont know
they get up
maybe another levee broke upriver
theyve been just then
the fireball rips across the dark sky illuminating everything showing
fifty feet away jim mr
mehlor and ray in the ski boat and kenny on the jet ski guns aimed at tom and karen
as the lightning passes and in the darkness the thunder rolls
switch on their lights and move forward
floating down the street with other debris
the cars have been damaged by the flood one is missing a door
when they get closer to the sheriffs station what they see or dont see makes them stop
tom and karen have disappeared
karens boat is still moored to the sheriffs station roof empty
theyre in the water
kenny cut your engine
kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet ski
jim shuts down the boat engine
they float in silence scanning the water with their flashlights
theres no sign of tom and karen
tom motions karen to follow him
shes freaked and hesitates
tom grabs her hand and pulls her
the ski boat and jet ski are right above them flashlights playing over the water
reach the roof of the sheriffs station
jim looks around
kenny go that way
well go down here
of kenny and jim heading off in different directions
rise into view in a car
they gasp for air and keep low
tell them where the money is
well i can
shes about to call out
tom grabs her hard
if they know where the money is they will kill us
before karen can say anything a flashlight beam comes swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater
watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car
he guns his engine and heads off down the street
floats off around a corner
tom and karen surface catch their breath
quiet for a few moments as they both look around to see that jim and his men are gone
so what do we do
i guess just drive around until we run out of gas
pissed look ive spent the last eight months of my life restoring that church and i just left it to come save your ass so spare me okay
beat when we get down here a little further well find a place for you to hide
off her look im gonna get back to the truck and wait for the national guard
checks watch they should be there pretty soon
tom looks at her
no im fine
the heater just kicked in
tom looks at her gives a little grin
their eyes meet for a second then they look away
phil climbs up onto the roof exhausted
he sees the hole in the roof and goes to look at it
as hes looking down
is he dead
phil turns to see
coasting up in their boats
someone got him out
hesitates maybe karen
how could she get him out
you took her out of town
i it lets hear it phil
it happened real fast okay
tom and karen float down the alley in the car
you ever been robbed before
the scariest thing that ever happened before was charlie running out of donuts

silence for a few moments

phil climbs into the sheriffs boat
she know karate or something phil
maybe kung fu
i mean i cant see how else she could overpower the likes of you
shut up wayne
shut up both of you
lets go find karen see if shes got him
the sheriff fires up his engine and heads off wayne following
karen and tom are still in the car
they freeze at the sound of engines in the distance
the sounds fade
tom looks around
god i wonder whose car this is
karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water
well whoever it is he listens to pat benatar eddie money and the soundtrack to footloose
looks at tapes hold on
looks around car i think this is my car from high school
gets caught on something and stops
looks like we get out here
karen hesitates come on i told your father id have you home by ten
down the street explodes
hear a sparking sound and look over to see
on a telephone power pole close to them
rain hits it causing the sparking sound
the floodwater is inching up the pole toward it
the water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds
and while theyre staring at that
at the end of the street explodes as water hits it
look around what to do
they climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house
water is three inches from the transformer two inches
swimming as hard as they can
one inch from the water
reach the house
they pull themselves up onto a television antenna ladder running up the side of the house
karens feet are still in the water
get your feet up
the water is about to touch
theres a sizzling sound
they heave a huge sigh of relief but then tom realizes
re antenna ladder its metal
tom pushes karen over onto a window ledge
then just as toms about to step over
comes screaming in on the jet ski
he dives off the jetski gets a hold of tom and pulls him under
kenny is stronger and he has tom in a tight grip
one problem kenny doesnt know the danger theyre in
kenny shoves tom underwater
tom comes up looks over at
the sizzling is getting louder
we have to
kenny dunks tom again
tom grabs kennys arms and pulls himself up fast
toms head comes out of the water and slams into kennys chin
kenny is stunned
tom gets free of his grasp
tom does the backstroke pulling hard toward karen
still stunned finally hears the sizzling and looks over at
the water touches the outer casing of the transformer
starts swimming fast toward
karen grabs toms arm and tom gets a hold of the windowsill and pulls himself up
and starts pulling himself out of the water
feels pretty pleased with himself until
starts dancing with electricity and
is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames
dead fish start floating to the surface
is fried smoking
he falls off the tv antenna and hits the water with a loud and ugly hiss
he floats away his body shaking spasmodically
tom hears an engine approaching
he looks around then smashes the window with his elbow
the window glass tumbles in
tom reaches in undoes the latch and slides up the window
he climbs in straddling the window sill
the camera moves down toms leg to show
laying on the floor just below the window
he starts to put his foot down into the trap
just then he knocks
off the windowsill
it falls straight down into
hitting the trigger
the jaws snap obliterating the cactus
snaps into view pointing right at toms head
you so much as breathe funny and your head is going back out that window without you
jim drives the boat down the street
mehlor is scanning the water with a flashlight
jim looks over to see
floating in the water
and not far from it is
sequence omitted from original script
doreen holds the shotgun on tom and karen as they move away from the window hands raised
real slow now
like you were in a big jar of molasses
they hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs
you havent killed anybody have you
ive got everything under control henry

jesus doreen you caught a whole gang
jim and mr
mehlor pull kenny into the ski boat
kenny is shivering
part of his hair has been burned away
jesus god it hurts

mehlor knows these things and he thinks youre gonna be okay
mehlor looks at jim
mehlor knows these things and he thinks kenny is going to die

mehlor moves aside
jim puts his arms around kenny
i know you didnt want me to come

hey hey the pains goin

he looks up at jim and grins

kennys shivering stops
it stops because hes dead
jim slowly lets go
henry and doreen have brought everything into their attic a tv some silver and china bowling trophies
a coleman lantern lights the room
sarcastic well isnt that just wonderful
now these bastards are gonna want to kill us too
why the hell did you have to come to this house

they look at him surprised
the national guardll be at the truck in about fifteen minutes
im gonna go wait for them
you cant swim that far in fifteen minutes
he could take our boat
to tom ill go get it ready for you
henry he is not taking our boat
henry ignores doreen
he pushes the attic stairs down heads down them
grabs tv to tom here
you want a tv too
how about some china
maybe our silver
sets tv down henry
henry you leave the boat where it is
doreen heads off down the stairs
tom starts down the stairs stops
she looks at him im tom
they shake hands
watch yourself tom
i really dont wanna have to save your life again
tom nods and goes down the stairs
henry stands on the roof of the back porch steadying a small rowboat as tom gets in
doreen nags from the window
you give away our only boat in the middle of a flood
you are a genius henry
a goddamn genius
whispers to henry re doreen you wanna come with me
henry looks at tom entertaining the notion
jesus henry what are you waiting for a kiss goodbye
get back in here
henry sighs and lets go of the boat
tom rows off
we see him in silhouette crossing the gap between two houses
are watching from the shadows on the dark side of the street
why dont we just get him
if our resourceful young friend hears us coming hell electrocute us or sink us or one of youll shoot him
glances at watch i know where hes going
what id like to know is where he came from
the sheriff sits in his boat moored to the wall of sandbags around the church
waynes boat is tied up next to it
the floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall
the gas powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay
come out of the front doors of the church
theyre not here
tom rows up to the truck and welcome sign
his flashlight shows just the top of the truck and sign
tom looks at his watch ties the rowboat to the sign jumps into the water
a few moments pass then tom surfaces holding a shotgun
then he senses something behind him and turns to see
floating in the water tongue out eyes glassy
kicks away horrified
and then he hears an engine
jims ski boat is coming over the water
the engine cuts out and the ski boat drifts a hundred feet from tom
yelling son before you go underwater and do something tricky theres something id like you to see
a flashlight comes on the beam swivels illuminating
standing in the ski boat blinking in the light
now i know its your job to protect that money and maybe youd even be foolish enough to give your life for it
the question is are you willing to give their lives for it
jim puts a pistol to doreens head
drop the gun and get into the boat
thinks for a second then throws the shotgun away and pulls himself into the rowboat
as tom and jim call to each other across the water doreen goes at henry
ill take you to the money but you gotta let them go
i hope youre proud of yourself henry sears
i think itd be best if i told you not to give him the goddamn boat
i think itd be best if we all stayed together
you say all you want is the money
let them go
i dont know if thats we could be safe in our home instead of out here in a boat with these low life scumbags
after a look at doreen nods to mr
mehlor let em go
the sheriff wayne and phil motor past the statue
wayne is driving his boat phil is with the sheriff
the water is up to the generals neck
tom helps henry and doreen over into the rowboat
as he does his face comes close to henrys for a second
shakes head whispers in the attic
they never saw her
karen swims down the center of the street
tom is in the ski boat with jim
he looks out at
as henry rows them off into the darkness
disappearing in dark faster henry
the bastards might change their minds
stop lily dipping and move it
henry starts to turn the boat around
whatre you doing
im gonna row back there and see if hell shoot you
fine either way
do you want me to get us out of here
yes of course i then shut the fuck up
henry turns the boat around and rows off
doreen is silent
jim shakes his head
tom looks at ray coughing and at kenny dead
tom doesnt know what to say
the only thing i want to hear from you is where the money is
the sheriff and wayne are motoring fast down a street the sheriff leading
the sheriff sees something in the water in front of him
he curses and throttles down fast
is in the water exhausted and cold
jim pilots the ski boat into the cemetery
all are aghast
are floating in the water
half of them have drifted up against the fence the others are headed that way
i wonder where they think theyre going
what the hells going on
this happened in a flood in georgia
the ground gets soggy and the caskets are air tight anyone who hasnt been planted too long just pops up
you teach your students stuff like that
no wonder they kicked you out
i didnt teach my students anything at all
to tom where is it
its hard to tell now with the water so deep
jim cocks the hammer on his pistol
tom gets the hint
its down there a little further
jim nods gives the engine some juice and they move on
takes a quick look at his watch
sees tom looking at his watch
karen is in the sheriffs boat wearing phils jacket trying to warm up
tom went off in their rowboat
to phil its tom now
looks like you lost out pal
where was he going
back to the armored truck
jim throttles down the ski boat engine
a little farther theyre not coming son
tom looks over at jim pretending to be confused
the national guard
theyre not coming
i dont i know youve been trying to stall until they show up but theyre not coming
pause as he realizes oh god
you intercepted charlies call then you called them off
no son i didnt call them off
they never were coming
we didnt intercept charlies call
he called us direct
and on toms look of disbelief
hank is on the radio
id love to help you sheriff but i cant leave
if the water goes over the top again its bye bye dam
bye bye town
in fact i could use a little help up here myself
the sheriff is in his boat wayne is back in his own
the sheriff is on the radio
hank remember when mike crane holed up in jack finchs barn and said he was gonna burn it down
hey i was the one who got the dumb son of a bitch to come out
and before you went in i deputized you you dumb son of a bitch
so when i say get down here its not a request its an order
so get down here
i wont need you for long
and bring your gun
we were gonna hit you just before you got on the interstate but then you got stuck so we had to change our plans and take you bullshit
this is all bullshit
i knew charlie when we were both working construction for the johnstown company
his middle name was mccarthy because his parents loved charlie mccarthy on the radio
his wifes name was mary
she died of a heart attack last year
he has a daughter and a son both grown with children of their own
im afraid i dont know the names of the grandchildren
tom looks down not wanting to believe
what else do i know
i know uncle charlie was trying to steer his favorite nephew away from a life of crime
tom suddenly lunges for jim
ray yanks tom back
whyd you shoot him
kill charlie and you get to keep another share
no that was an accident
ken shot him
eyes kenny sadly i never told him charlie was on my side
ken liked to talk
shakes head he shouldntve been here
but his dad asked me to watch over him
i guess i didnt do the best job
excuse me jim
i hate to interrupt and all but could we just get the money and get the hell out of here
nods to tom im gonna ask you one more time
and before you think of bullshitting me again keep in mind i have had a very frustrating night
and while i know ill never get the money if i kill you its getting to the point where i just dont care
jim casually aims his gun at tom
ill tell you where it is
but its not going to do you any good
jim arches an eyebrow
the guard may not be coming but someone else sure as hell is
at the controls of his boat moving fast sprayed by rain
karen and phil are in the back of the boat
wayne is close behind in his boat
ill take my chances
tom pauses looks over to
just the top of it is visible
two more coffins float nearby
jim steers the ski boat over hands tom a flashlight
well go get it
tom climbs over the edge of the ski boat and into the water
he turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface
eyeing tom in water at night wed go down to the river and into the river wed dive
off jim and mehlors looks springsteen the river
im all out of bible quotes
tom shines his light on
one end of a rope is tied to the crypt
the other end cut and frayed is suspended in the water waving in the current
jim watches toms light rise
tom comes up fast takes a breath
smug looks like somebody beat you to it
oh for christs im gonna shoot him jim
ray grabs pistol in his belt
before he can pull it out holes puff out of his chest followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle shots
ray tumbles into the water
a half second later theres
ripping into the ski boat water trees crypt
are outside the fence a hundred feet from the crypt
push in fast on
to the rescue
he and wayne and phil fire their guns
pulls his pistol returns fire
opens fire with a shotgun shooting wild yelling
then hes hit and knocked out of the boat dead
youll hit tom
the sheriff stops shooting yells at the others
hold your fire
wayne and phil stop shooting
tom is holding onto a coffin out of view of the sheriff
he hears a rush of bubbles and turns as
comes to the surface breathing deep
comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to toms forehead
theres an adrenal fire in the sheriffs eyes
he starts his boat forward wayne following
their lights find
no sign of life
then theres a sound and the lights sweep over to find
climbing up on top of the mostly submerged crypt
jim is behind tom with his gun to toms head
stops his boat
wayne stops too
they are thirty yards from jim and tom
a look passes between them
to sheriff now sir i can imagine youd love nothing more than to shoot me but i caution you in order to do that youre gonna have to shoot through
young tom here
thinks for a second then shrugs
he raises his rifle
realizes what is about to happen
also clue in but before they can move
squeezes the trigger as
hits the gun with her arm
is grazed in the arm by the bullet
smacks karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the boat unconscious
throw themselves back off the crypt as
empty their guns in their direction
returns fire shooting blindly over the top of the crypt
reaches for karen floating limp in the water but
he grabs karen and pulls her into his boat then grins at phil
are behind the crypt
tom holds his bleeding arm
well that was unexpected
is he the one you thought was coming to your rescue
no answer from tom but the answer is clear
the sheriff and wayne reload
anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on
the sheriff wayne and phil turn to see
in his boat right behind them all dressed up in hunting gear rifle at the ready
that money i told you about
from the armored car
were gonna keep it
three million dollars
shoots at crypt seven fifty apiece
you okay with that
hank is stunned
he doesnt answer
you okay with that
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars
beat grins damn straight im okay with that
grumbling re hank dont see what we needed him for
then i guess youve never been hunting with hank
to hank we got two behind that crypt
he motions for wayne to go one way hell go the other
they start off
a blind shot comes from jim behind the crypt
the sheriff shoots back
phil finally musters up the courage to say something
maybe im not okay with it
come on now phil
youre gonna kill people
theyre looters phil
they come and steal from an armored truck in our town theyre looters
fires two shots what about tom
what about karen
theyre not looters
no theyre witnesses
the sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets
behind the crypt bullets winging by
jim looks over sees
motor into view
flattens against the crypt then turns to see
coming into view on the other side
looks at jim sees hes occupied in the fight with hank
then he sees
floating in the water dead pistol still jammed in his pants
thinks decides and reaches out for ray
shooting at hank
he hears gunfire from wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him
he turns to see
shooting back at wayne with rays gun
pulls back out of the line of fire
curses and pulls back too
exchange a look
how can you do this
jeez phil i always thought wayne was the stupid one
read my lips
slowly three million dollars
look at it
the sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money
a couple of those bags are gonna be yours phil
but but youre the sheriff
the sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away
im the what
jim looks at tom then hands tom his pistol
tom doesnt know what jims doing
jim slips beneath the water
whistles and gets waynes attention
he motions wayne to try it again
for twenty years youve been for twenty years ive been eating shit breakfast lunch and dinner
well tonight im changing the menu
from now on everything i eat is gonna be shit free
tom is looking for jim to see what hes doing
come around on both sides
starts shooting at them with the two pistols
as they go
draped over the side of waynes boat
takes another shot at hank but stops firing at wayne
jims hand appears over the gunwale
he reaches in and grabs
and pulls it out of the boat
can i make it any clearer phil
do you want me to draw pictures
phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the sheriff
i cant let you do it
oh for beat okay phil
but heres how its gonna go
im gonna hear one of two things out of you
either im gonna hear you say youre in with us or
moves close to phils gun im gonna hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me
phil is incredulous
the sheriff weighs his hands like scales
one hand seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or
other hand you kill me
the sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times
phil slumps lowers the gun
there we go
flies through the air lands in the water by the sheriff
and it starts sinking in the water
haul himself into the ski boat
in the boat
start shooting at jim in the ski boat
sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire
starts swimming for the boat
see tom and start shooting at both he and jim when
erupts in a huge geyser
are knocked off their feet
the sheriff phil and hank are thrown into the water
their boats are rocked up and back and swamped with falling water
fires up his engine
is almost to the boat
gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting
gets to jims boat and grabs onto it
cranks the throttle and dragging tom tears off under the hail of waynes bullets
as jim races through the tombstones barely missing halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs
rams into one cross
start to slip from the boat
grabs toms hand and holds on as they shoot off across the water
get back in the boats
jim hauls tom into the boat
tom lays on the bottom catching his breath
blood is dripping down from his arm
beat looks up at jim you really want that money
jim gives tom a look of course he wants that money
cause the only way youre ever gonna see it is if you help me get karen
before jim can answer gunshots ring out behind them
they look back to see
coming after them in the three boats shooting closing
were too slow
thinks then here
jim moves away from the wheel giving it to tom
tom gets up and takes over
jim bends and picks up
lifeless and limp
looks at kenny for a moment then pushes his body overboard
flying over the water
they see a body tumble out of the ski boat
jim looks back following kenny with his eyes
jim and tom make the turn onto main street
they look back as
come around the corner two hundred yards back
theyre not going to catch us now
of the ski boat racing toward camera
as it gets closer the camera booms down underwater to reveal
the sword tip just below the surface
the ski boat theres a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams into the propeller
are thrown forward
slams head first into the dash
the propeller has stopped
looks back to see that
has almost been ripped from its moorings
okay so maybe they are gonna catch us now
no answer from jim
tom looks down
is laying on the deck unconscious
has his rifle resting on his boats windshield and is firing off a clip on automatic as he wayne and the sheriff close in
ducks down and tries to start the engine
it catches on the third try
tom guns it and the boat tears off
is wobbling vibrating
keeps up his stream of gunfire
stays down driving blind as the bullets fly in blowing holes in the windshield
he looks at jim at the engine and curses
he steers the boat toward
all lit up brilliant white in the darkness a quarter mile away
the water is now over the sandbag wall
the first several feet of the church are flooded
comes up fast
tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall
tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing jim and pushing him out of the boat and into the water
hits the cold water and comes to sputtering
grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the water
he lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and fires off a clip
jims bullets plug into their boats
they circle back
tom pushes jim still groggy into the flooded church
tom shuts the door
he piles the weapons on a shelf
he sees jim touch his head
wayne and hank are alongside the sheriff engines idling as they look at the church
nods to hank then go get some bottles
hank nods guns his engine
to hank wait what about the dam
itll be fine
you said if it goes itll wipe out the town
fuck the town
hank nods in agreement and takes off
jim and tom are by one of the stained glass windows looking out through a pale colored pane at the sheriff and his men across the street
they watch hank race off
does he have the girl
shakes head shes in the small boat
tom touches the wound on his head
jesus im gonna get hepatitis
you probably already got cholera
tom gives jim a look then starts for the back of the church
whatre you doing
theres a back room
touches wound maybe theyve got something i can use on this
you been in here before
bad memory oh yeah
i saw jesus
water is starting to go over the top again
it pours down in sheets over the face of the dam
jim is by the window looking out at the sheriff and wayne across the street in the shadows
he turns as
enters from the back
hes got a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a towel
he splashes some of the alcohol on the towel then touches it to his wound
it hurts like a sonofabitch
after a beat
so has this all gone pretty much how you thought it would
jim turns on tom
everything would have gone fine if youdve just walked away from the truck
well everything wouldve gone even better if you hadnt decided to rob the damn truck in the first place
jim looks away
after another silence
did charlie have cancer or something
you mean why was he doing this
thinks shrugs no cancer
beat didnt you ever think about taking the money
a man who used to make his living fencing hot jackhammers never thought about what hed do with three million dollars
sorry to disappoint you
beat what are you gonna do with it
as little as possible
silence for a few moments then
jim looks at him
its this small country in central america on the atlantic side
i know where belize is
what about it
they speak english and the dollar goes a long way
beautiful beaches friendly people
and theyve got liberal banking laws
no you didnt think about taking that money at all
busted you cant ride in the truck and not think about it
and i guess thats pretty much how it started with charlie
tom thinks nods and presses the towel to his wound again
wayne is thinking about something
he makes a decision and flicks on his engine

phil looks scared shitless
water continues to pour over the top
close on concrete chunks of cement are starting to wash away
tom finishes reloading a gun
what youre gonna swim after her
tom doesnt answer
he moves toward the front door
jim cuts him off
you aint gonna help her by getting shot
hes gone and you dont know where
the sheriff knows
i think maybe ill go ask him
youll be dead before you get over the sandbags
beat look hell be coming for us
you can ask him then
jim sees something out the window
what if he doesnt come
i wouldnt worry about that
tom sees what jim sees
the sheriff phil and hank are heading toward the church flaming molotov cocktails in their hands
the sheriff phil and hank heave the flaming molotov cocktails
the bottles hit explode
sheets of fire rain down the roof
smashes through a window
tom and jim duck down as
flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a wall sending sheets of fire down the wall
the roof is on fire
modest two story on a side street
the front door is open the boat tied up outside
theres a light on in the front hall
karen is unconscious
wayne has her laying on the stairs leading up from the entry area to the second floor
theres three feet of water in the house
karens legs are in the water
her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the wall running up the stairs
wayne stands over karen pats her face
karen stirs then starts slipping back into unconsciousness so wayne splashes her face with water
karen comes to sputtering
her eyes focus
she looks up at wayne
dear penthouse i always thought your letters were fake until the wildest thing happened to me
im a policeman in a small town
in the middle of the big flood last year i was patrolling the streets in a boat feeling kind of sorry for myself cause it was my birthday and all
when i saw the front door to a house was open
i pulled my gun afraid it might be looters
imagine my surprise when instead of a looter i find a young woman handcuffed to the railing of her stairs
her name was karen and ever since she came back from college shed made it clear she was too good for any of us local folk
now here she was in handcuffs
i said what the heck is going on here maam
and she said
karen says nothing
wayne leans in close
and she said
sorry wayne but im not playing a part in your sick little play
wayne pulls his gun puts it to karens head
youre perfect for the role
i suggest you reconsider
youll kill me
youre gonna do that anyway
i might get clumsy
it might take a while
im sure you can hurt me
but its all going to be the same when im dead
wayne straightens up looks at her then launches back into it
and she said happy birthday wayne
ive got something for you
well im not stupid
i knew what she wanted to give me and i knew she wanted to give it bad so i sparks and goes out
looks up at light that wont do
mans gotta see what hes doing
wayne heads off for the kitchen
the second hes gone
raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls out her swiss army knife
she pries open the big blade
she hears wayne sloshing back toward her
she gets back into the position wayne left her in as
re enters carrying two burning candles in candle holders
i got the candles
alls we need is a cake
he sets the candles down on a dry step above karens head
he leans in close
you in the mood yet
no answer from karen back into penthouse letter and then she said my presents ready and waiting
alls you gotta do is unwrap it
wayne reaches into the water undoes karens rain pants yanks off her shoes then pulls off her pants
he throws them over the banister
karen remains passive blank
wayne takes off his holster hangs it on the banister
then he pushes his pants down to his ankles
his shirttail is long enough so that we dont have to see his wretched little pecker
he climbs on top of karen in the water brings his face close to hers
it was cold and rainy that birthday night and all i wanted was to get someplace warm and dry
as it turned out what i really wanted was something warm and wet
wayne grins and closes for a kiss and
moves fast with the knife and
pop open wide
his head jerks back
he tries to shout but all that comes out is an awful gurgle
he tries to push off karen but
wraps her legs around him holds him close pinning him
finally breaks free
he tries to stop the bleeding with a hand but the blood spurts through his fingers
he reaches for his gun in his holster on the banister but just as he grabs it
lashes out of the water with her legs kicking wayne in the groin pushing him back
tries to get his balance but his feet cant move his pants are around his ankles
he falls back into the water firing his pistol
blow chunks out of the wall next to karen hit the ceiling and
is floating on his back trying to lift the pistol but his strength is fading fast
he gets off one last shot and
nearest karen is blown to pieces
the gun drops into the water
no more shots
no more life
he floats pants around his ankles covered in blood dead
happy birthday wayne
the church roof is on fire
are across the street
jim and tom hear a creaking and look up
the fire has eaten holes in the roof
embers come down
the sheriff is getting very agitated
theyre not coming out hank
the fires not catching
the rains too we have to get them
we have to kill them
do you understand
if theyre not dead we got jack shit
a small chunk of burning ceiling drops down
jim and tom look up
floods into the church through
filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors
look out the windows
my god theyre beautiful
remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter and blow inwards as
come crashing through
land stop fast
the sheriffs boat lands closer to the pulpit hanks boat closer to the balcony
its quiet for a moment
theres no sign of tom and jim
karen has her pants back on
she reaches out with one foot and hooks waynes holster off the banister
she flips it through the air and catches it with her hands
she opens little leather pockets mace more bullets
karen starts to panic
there have to be keys
there she sees
still floating on his back still dead
she looks closer at
bunched around his ankles
and there hanging from a belt loop is a ring of keys
reaches out with her foot for waynes pants
she cant reach
is slowly drifting out the open door
beyond the door in the light of the streetlamp the water is riffling moving and wayne is heading toward it
slides down further on the stairs into the water then stops
there are metal supports going from the railing to the wall every three feet
karen is prevented from going any further down the stairs by one of these supports
reaches out with a foot straining stretching her body almost dislocating her shoulder and
just barely touches one of waynes feet but then waynes foot slips away and
can only watch as
drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current
water is cascading over the top of the dam
chunks of concrete are washing away
the sheriff phil and wayne scan the water looking for movement
where are they
looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the burning timbers above
come into view pointed up through the water
the sheriff phil and hank have let down their guard for a second when theres a series of dull muted clacks from underwater as
come streaking out of the water winging by them plugging into the boats
jim fires the pistols the bullets bubble streaks knifing up through the water
hit the deck in their boats returning fire over the gunwales
surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony gasping for air
he runs for the stairs
start to fall from the burning roof frame hitting the water with loud sizzling hisses
turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris
disappears up the stairs the bullets just missing him
jim runs out of bullets
hes long since run out of air
he drops his guns and swims under the pews
looks up realizing that tom will be able to shoot down on him
he reverses his boat fast under the balcony as
shoots down from the balcony blowing a chunk out of the prow of hanks boat
the water is up to karens chin
her hands are working frantically beneath the water
shes using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws holding the support to the railing
shes on the last one
the blade slips misses gets a quarter turn another quarter turn
spits out the water that spills into her mouth
another quarter turn and the screw is loose enough to turn by hand
holds her breath with the water touching her nose
she gets the screw loose pulls up on the railing and pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing
the sheriff turns to phil and nods re jim
you take care of him
the sheriff aims at the balcony as phil scans the water looking for jim
jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket
tom ducks down as the sheriffs bullets start plugging through the wood front of the balcony
tom moves away from the bullet strikes splashing through the water in the balcony
as bang bang bang bullets start shooting up from below
is firing up at tom through the floor of the balcony
jumps back startled looking down at
holes explode in the floor sending up small geysers of water
the water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes
moves back from hanks advancing bullet holes
is caught between hanks bullets and the sheriffs bullets
so he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off the balcony
is still shooting up as
arcs off the balcony firing the shotgun under the balcony at hank
dives to the floor of his boat as toms shotgun blasts blow plate sized holes in the church doors
lands in the water and goes under
look for tom in the water
starts to get up from the bottom of his boat searching for a clip for his gun
sees toms shape in the water and is about to shoot when
jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord
he tosses a loop of the cord around the sheriffs neck and pulls yanking the sheriff out of the boat
comes out of the water aiming his shotgun at
who is aiming his pistol at tom
struggle in the water
jim pulls the cord tightly around the sheriffs neck as the sheriff tries to get a shot off at jim he cant get the barrel pointed at jim
fumbles with the bullet clip
to phil kill him
turns his shotgun on hank and pulls the trigger click
exchange a look
slams the clip into his gun and levels it at tom
points his gun at hank
we cant bang
and hank shoots phil
phil pitches back out of the sheriffs boat
lands between jim and the sheriff knocking them apart
is free of jims grasp
he shakes off the electrical cord and turns to shoot
who moves a little faster
he grabs phils pistol and puts it to the sheriffs head before the sheriff can bring his gun around
draws a bead on jim and is about to shoot when
comes out of the water on the other side of hanks boat
tom pushes down hard on the side of the boat
is rocked back thrown off balance
he starts to spin and bring his gun around when
swings with the shotgun catching
in the side of the head
hank crumples and falls into the water taking his rifle with him
jim nods at the sheriffs rifle
in the boat
hesitates then tosses his rifle into the boat
grabs hanks rifle and aims it at the sheriff
karen undoes a last screw in a metal support
she pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support and railing
shes at the top of the stairs
curves and goes into the wall
tugs at the railing tries rocking it up and down
it doesnt budge
she starts chipping at the plaster with the knife
god i am really beginning to hate fine craftsmanship
its up to her chest
the sheriff hesitates
where is she
they went back to her house
wheres her house
its and just then they all hear something truly ominous a siren pierces the night
she reacts to the siren uh oh
the siren wails
what in gods name is that
woozy but okay its topped out
how much time we got
how should i know
its an old dam
to tom then id say you boys better drop your guns
thats the deal
you let me and hank go with a few of these bags and ill tell you where to find karen
to the sheriff get out of the boat
jim turns to look at tom
its the only way youre gonna find her
its only a couple of bags
but i thought look i dont know what you thought but i told you im here for the money thats all
tom doesnt know what to do
the sheriff looks pretty pleased with himself
he might just get out of this
she lives on boyd street
they all look over at
alive but barely
two story blue shutters
looks at jim disappointed angry then hurries to hanks boat
climbs into the sheriffs boat
climbs into hanks boat
he starts the engine looks down at
floating in the water dying
a brief look between them then
drives the boat out through a shattered window
pushes the sheriff out of the boat
a large v is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging water
looking back at the dam
the line of lights on top of the dam start to fall over then go dark snuffed out by an unseen force
jim keeps his gun leveled at the sheriff and hank standing in the water as he pulls the money bags up from the forward hold
so you just gonna kill me
lord knows i should
jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees
karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above water
and then she hears a window smash
she turns as
wades in along the upper hall
im guessing you cant get up
tom reaches into the water for the railing
the railings bolted to the wall
he looks at her
ive got a saw
in the kitchen
in the tall cupboard beside the and then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren they hear the siren stop
is that good or bad
jim the sheriff and hank react to the silence
jim looks off
turns back at the sound of the sheriff going under
the sheriff pulls up his pant leg
is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as
comes out of the water shooting a pistol
is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and he stumbles back bellowing and falls out of the sheriffs boat and into the water
you shouldve just killed me
you gotta go
tom starts hyperventilating
the dams gone
you gotta go
shakes head i owe you one
tom breathes deep then ducks underwater
tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the stairs
watches tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water
phil is grabbing for the sheriffs boat as the sheriff and hank zoom out of the church leaving him behind
the sheriffs boat comes onto main street moving fast
hank is looking back in the direction the flood will come
we gotta go faster
yeah youre right
the sheriff pushes hank out of the boat
goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight post
tom swims down into the living room
his light shows a couch chairs tv set
books and newspapers are suspended in the water
the damaged ski boat that jim and tom took to the church has slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting
a peaceful scene
but then from the distance comes a rushing roar
phil hears the roar
he looks around lost
hank groggy in the water also hears the distant roar
the roar is building getting louder
phil sees something in the water and reaches for it frantically
he gets it
and he clutches it to his chest as
hits the church
tom swims into the kitchen
he looks for the tall cupboard by the fridge
he opens it
hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw
tom grabs it
hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post
he looks back
streetlights in the distance winking out one by one marking the advance of the wall of water
oh my god
hank looks around for safety
he sees it
theres an alleyway
swims for the alley
roars through the town pushing a rolling wave of debris obliterating anything in its path
hank swims into the alley
hank looks for something to climb up on to hold onto
at the end of the alley
swims for it
he hears the rushing roar of the advancing flood
he expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley
comes into the alley banking high on the far wall before coming down and barreling toward hank
and what makes it worse for hank is that theres
at the front of the wave being pushed by the water
dives clear just as
smashes into the wall right where hank had just been
relief in his eyes
he gets to the fire escape and is climbing to safety when
comes into the alley rolling in the flood spraying propane from a torn hose
barely has time to scream
tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to secure it
he gets it done and starts to swim out of the kitchen
just karens lips and nose are above water
tom is about to leave when everything starts to move rocking from side to side as if in a slow motion earthquake
cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates tumble out
the house has been hit by the flood
its being pulled by the massive current stretching overhead phone and power lines
karen hears the groaning ripping as the house tears free from water and sewer lines
shes looking down for tom when theres a snap and the light above her goes out
the house is carried on the current turning in the water
tom watches astounded as the room starts to turn around him
he kicks fast for the door to
tom swims in fast toward the stairs when
caves in and
smashes in filling the room blocking toms route to the stairs
tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves but cant
he swims over to another window and slides it up
keeps looking down for tom
the house is impaled on a tree the current sluicing around it
surfaces near the side of the house gasping
the current starts ripping him past the house
he swims as hard as he can back to the house reaches out and grabs onto a gutter
karen doesnt have much time left
the water is washing over her mouth and nose
and just as shes about to go under
swims in with the saw
he starts sawing on the handrail
everythings going fine
look at each other
karens going under
he dives into the water
can only watch and wait
whats he doing
surfaces holding waynes pistol
he puts the mouth of the barrel to the handcuff chain shields karens face looks away and pulls the trigger
the water swirls through the branches of a half submerged tree
are in the tree
henry is either unconscious or dead
doreen cradles him
come on henry
forget that go to the light crap
come back to me
youre all ive got
and henry starts to come to
henry opens his eyes
next time when i say lets evacuate were gonna evacuate
whatever you say honey
she hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back
tom and karen swim out of a second floor window grab the rain gutter
tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs karen and helps her up
they crawl until theyre clear of the edge
only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling water
they are just catching their breath when they are hit by
and they look to see
in his boat shining a searchlight on them with one hand a gun in the other
he starts shooting
tom pushes karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets plug in around them
tom pushes karen over the top then turns and dives off the roof and into the water
hears an engine behind her and turns
racing toward the house
and at the controls is
is wobbling vibrating at the back of the boat almost loose from its moorings
he sees karen crouched below the peak of the house a bright light coming from the other side along with gunshots
pushes the throttle all the way forward
tom swims hard toward the sheriffs boat
is shooting down into the water at toms moving shape
with jim at the wheel comes racing straight toward the house
thinks hes going to turn
rolls to the side just getting clear as
hits the sloping roof of karens house and ramps up it
digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the back of the boat
hears the sound and looks up as
comes over the peak of the roof
surfaces to see
fly right over him heading straight for
who ducks down just in time as
misses him landing just past him in the water
straightens up grinning with glee that the boat missed him
and then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him
he turns just in time to see
flipping end over end propeller whirring heading straight for him
starts to scream
looking over the peak of the roof in horror
she hears the sheriffs scream and the scream of the propeller and then a horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop
the sheriff is gone
the side has been smashed out of the boat and the boat is flooding with water
is just some misshapen thing trailing red floating in the water
tries to restart the ski boat but its dead
he slumps forward
sees jim slump against the side of the boat
tom can tell jims anything but
tom swims for the boat
tom swims up pulls himself in
he pulls jim back off the controls sees the blood
we gotta get you to jim looks at tom
tom understands jims not going anywhere
you just saved our lives
i just came for the money
tom looks at jim he knows jims lying
do you need any help
grabs toms arm no
tell her to stay back
to karen its okay
jim lets go of tom
youre going to turn it in
sorry to disappoint you
well hell then i guess i better take it after all
i figure the riverll carry me down to the gulf of mexico
if i catch the right currents maybe ill end up in
tom nods you come look me up
ill buy you a drink
ill do that
jim grimaces as hes hit by a wave of pain
he looks away
tom hesitates for a second
tom turns and slides into the water and swims away
son dont think too badly of your uncle charlie
he always said you were capable of remarkable things
beat he was right
theres a last look between jim and tom then tom swims away
smiles the rains stopped
breathes deep the air after a rain
jim slowly topples forward and is still
swims through the swirling current toward karens roof
sinks below the surface and is gone
karen is down at the waters edge with her arm extended to tom
tom grabs it and as karen pulls
karen pulls tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge of the new roof under construction
tom holds a paper bag
hes wearing work gear tool belt work boots etc
tom looks at the work being done on the roof
they got a lot done today
