a title we descend past dark clouds
violent flashes ripple within
thunder blends with drums as we reach a box canyon
whirling around the fire war paint masks and headdresses a religious rite or celebration
on the periphery we find
a beautiful apache woman
softly singing to the even more beautiful baby in her arms as we follow them into a teepee
the simple melody of the womans song as she lays the baby on a blanket gently swaddling it love in her eyes
the wind starts to howl
a burst of light through the opening of the teepee intense ultraviolet fwhoooooooooooooooshhss
her baby exposed
she screams grabs her child and starts to run chaos everywhere as the tribe scatters in terror suddenly apaches are getting yanked into the air by some superior force plucked
savagely into the light gone as we whip around the horror show of screaming disappearing indians and now a deafening shriek as strange domed objects hurtle impossibly the objects are steel machines
belly vents snap open and drill cones drop out jagged teeth churn to life faster faster as the drills begin chewing into the ground
the woman staggering back in shock and awe clings to her baby for one final scream and black
over which we read c
i s a n d a burning sun flares lens beating down on
lying in the barren desert
well call him the man in black the color of his dirty clothes
a pink tongue licks him
the man starts awake to find a mongrel dog over him
coughing the man stumbles up
howd he get here
and where the hell i
a gash in his side
part of the wound oddly seared
trying to solve this painful puzzle
something glints on his wrist a steel bracelet
no clasp to pull it off
he touches the surface tsss shit its hot
and theres a black stetson on the ground
the man grabs it to shield his eyes
but stofs a worn photograph in the inner brim
the man stares does he know this woman
is this even his hat
the dog barks alert
the man turns quick his hand reaches toward his hip on instinct but theres no holster
the claiborne brothers wes mose and luke
dusty and tough
wes gallops right up to our man gives him the once over howdy
were riding towards absolution
you know how far west we are
the mans got no idea what hes talking about
maybe hes a dummy
wes hops off his horse right in the mans face now there a reason you dont wanna answer my question friend
and now mose nods to the bracelet on the mans wrist wes hes got iron on his wrist
and hes been shot
bet hes a chain jumper
luke spurs his horse behind him the mans surrounded
if he escaped therell be a bounty
lets bring him with us
wes nods as he slides a sawed off double barrel from his back scabbard
cocks both barrels
the dog growls not your lucky day stranger turn round and start walking
but the man doesnt move
the claibornes share glances
wes steps forward raising his rifle dead or alive no difference
i said the man moves a mechanism of brutal violence yanks the rifle forward as blami shot goes wild suddenly the guns in the mans hands blaxi wes is blown
backwards hole in his chest
as hose draws his enfield the man flips the rifle again slam
mose flies off his saddle as the man rolls under lukes horse grabbing lukes ankle suddenly lukes flat on his back breathless staring up at the double barrel p please
god d dont the man pulls the trigger but click
the rifles empty
lukes relief is short as the man slams the gun butt down knocking him out cold
and all of this took about ten seconds
this man is a cold blooded killer
he didnt seem to know that
drops the rifle looks down at his hands
covered in blood
and the bodies in his wake
the wind loosens a piece of paper from wess jacket
it dances on the breeze flattens against the strangers foot
he picks it up bloody fingerprints on what we now see is a telegram a hoarse whisper absolution
with a hya
the man sends two horses galloping mounts the third wincing at that gash in his side
starts to trot off
sees the dog following
get outta here
leave me alone
but the dog keeps following
like theyre friends now
the man turns away dismissively as we boom up to reveal the wide open valley below
and a speck within it that is a crooked sign absolution
the town is dismal and forgotten
crumbling buildings blistered by sun
the man rides in dehydrated the wound draining him
his eyes fall on the first building he sees
the door flies open and votive candles flicker
the man looks at the dog and says stay
the dog sits by the door as the man enters empty hes moving into a small kitchen area bottle of whiskey uncorks it with his teeth drinks pours some on
the wound then a pistol cocks behind him meet meacham town preacher a tough wash foot baptist palms to heaven friend
the man freezes
turns up his hands
only two kinds of men get shot criminals and victims
steps forward hard which onere you
meacham hears the honesty in his voice
knows a lost soul when he sees one
lowers his gun softening
got a name son
dont know that either
what do you know
a beat then english
off meacham intrigued we cut to a candle flame a needle passing through it its later and meachams studying the mans wound odd wound
off the mans look means somethin burned it half closed
the man just stares
news to him
and now as meacham leans over the wound the metal cross around his neck begins to twitch
lifting ever so slightlx off his chest towards the strange bracelet on the mans wrist
meacham reacts nice trick
that some kinds
the man looks at him what the hell is a magnet
meacham shrugs it off readies the needle tryn hold still
he pokes the hot needle through the wound the man winces slightly but bears the pain
whered you ride in from
woke up in the desert
looking up at the sun like id been dropped outta the sky
seems i remember a story about that happening once
fella by the name of lucifer
how bout i just call you luke for short
but themans distracted by his reflection in a cracked mirror his own face unfamiliar
meacham nods towards the mans hands
that blood yours or somebody elses
three men rode up
drew on me
moved on their own
anything else you wanna confess to while you got my attention
and the man senses somehow that ygg there is
but everything that happened before i woke up
shakes his head its gone
cant absolve you for your sins if you dont recall em
that bein said
meacham looks up eyes twinkling
this is not a fire n brimstone preacher
this is a guy who gets it i seen bad men do good things and good men do bad things
whether you end up in heaven or hell
its not gods plan
you just got to remember what it was
the man considers
darkly what if i dont want to remember
then youre probly goin to hell
on cue smash
the stained glass window explodes as a molotov cocktail hurtles into the church
fire spreads around the pews meacham activates tears curtains off the confessional and uses them to stamp out the fire dammit its dolarhydes men
whoops and hollers and gunshots outside
the man whirls to see a dozen men on horseback marauding through town
their leader is percy dolarhyde a cocky hot tempered bastard he ignites another molotov hurls it at the claims office his name on it
the gang rides down main street hooting percy cocks another molotov aiming for the saloon but one of his men half apache nat colorado shouts percy
n t the saloon
why the goddamn hell not
cause your dady said so
something loaded in the way he emphasizes daddy
percy glares strange resentment between them
with a growl percy gallops off chucks the flaming bottle onto the church steps meacham finishes putting out the fire grabbing a couple blankets as he moves past the man
you wanna help or are you just gonna stand there and burn
frightened townspeople run for the sanctuary of the church meacham swats out the fire on the steps all right folks dont panic
get inside and youll be fine
meacham tosses the man one of the blankets nods across the street to the general store which is just starting to burn put it out before it gets goin
on the man not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire brigade but hustling across the street to
whips open the blanket beats at the flames advancing toward the roof puts the fire out as the door flies open and out steps a kid
rough n tumble
and right now mouth full of licorice
two full jars of candy in his hands
oops just tryin to save the candy
swallows worried now you one of my pas hired guns
before he can answer hoofbeats behind them and heres percy
he yanks the reins pulls his revolver on our man who the hellre yam

wings it right into percys face
percy flies off the horse the man grabbing his rifle the moment percy lands its sticking into his neck

the mans smashes percys skull with the gun knocking him out cold as lawmen approach on horseback fa

sheriff kyle taggart rears up on his horse
tall dark and handsome despite a sadness in his eyes already dismounting emmett you all right
the kid now emmett strides towards his father excitedly
a f lap jack then stared down nat colorado like he wasnt even scared
taggart turns to the man now cautious but grateful pardon my boy mister

and as the man heads off we hold on taggart his spidey sense tingling that all is not right with this

taggart takes one last look at the man departing as we cut to head of cattle under a blood red sky boom down to three ranch hands by a fire
ones drinking liberally from a bottle call him roy clanton
the other two trade glances nervous should take it easy there pal mr
dolarhyde dont like it when we drink on the job
i dont give a damn what he dont like gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of cattle
dolarhyde aint gonna do squat
rises grabs his gotta see a man about a buffalo
he lets out a big burp and stumbles off behind a ridge
something doesnt feel right
a sudden whoosh and just like the apaches in our opening
flies straight up out of frame
its plaintive moo blending into all the others you hear that
another cow zips up from the herd behind them
many of the swsshs
the men slowly turn toward the sound as roy clanton comes running back up the hill pulling up his pants as the light disappears to find the men gone
so are the cows
hes all thats left in the open range
the batwing doors swing open the man in black enters with the dog tips his hat to a couple whores
they grin liking what they see
ranch hands drink their pay
behind the bar a man and woman argue
doc and maria shes a buxom mexican beauty hes roly poly pounds of anxious castilian jealousy i know you are dont lie to me
how many times do we have to do this arturo
holds up a pocketwatch i found this in our bed
and i dont k vg

i cant afjqrd a watch because y insisted we buy this saloon
she looks at him squarely yes some secret withheld
as the man in black reaches the bar hes marias excuse to end this we have customers
and moves off
doc stomps toward the exit sees emmett at the back of the bar stealing sips of beer from left behind glasses emmett runs out
the man sits beside an old cuss named atticus
the dog heels at the mans feet eyes a steak on atticus plate that mutt makes a move for my steak ill drill him down
shut up atticus
this is the man who took out percy dolarhyde
atticus grumbles and goes back to eating but not before sweeping his duster aside to show the gun in his holster
maria rolls her eyes sets a glass in front of the man who nods im looking for a woman
she gestures to the whores what kind
he removes the photo from inside his hat
the one of the woman
never seen her before
but she is beautiful
pours him whiskey then one for herself heres to you finding her senor

not exactly sure he wants to
but they clink glasses knock em back
maria pours him another you have any idea what kind of mess you just stepped into
but i figured id be safe in here seein as how that boy i tossed off his horse didnt wanna burn your saloon
marias eyes go down
but then its not the boy you should worry about
its his papa
pov upside down a man surrounded by his ranch hands his face just out of the light hat brim lowered under an oil lamp names woodrow dolarhyde
im what you might call the tall hog at the trough
his face comes into light s tailored finery patent leather wellington boots that bespeak wealth
exudes power youre roy right
clanton is it
been working for me two weeks now and i havent had the pleasure
our pov belongs to roy clanton the ranch hand from the cow abductions
terrified his arms and legs tied to the saddles of two horses kicking dirt in front of dolarhydes ranch house mr
i swear i didnt a violent ssst from dolarhyde jostles the horses stretching roy tight enough to snap he screams best not to interrupt me roy makes the horses skittish
you partial to history
heres a primer he pulls out a whip gripping it by its sterling silver handle
starts circling the horses as he lets the whip unfurl following the war of northern aggression what some ironically refer to as the civil war came a prodigious nation wide
market for beef
cowtowns sprang up all along these prairies roy populated by enterprising young drovers among em my daddy jeremiah dolarhyde
sold six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted to him by robert e
lee for twenty of the scrawniest longhorns you ever saw then turned em into the fattest herd west of the chisholm trail
stops the whip watched him work this lash driving those steer til his fingers bled
but what goods a whip without a herd roy
and slowly torturously sweeps the whip tip in the dirt
dolarhyde sir you gotta believe me i went to take a piss and and saw a light in the sky blue and when i ran back the cows and fellas
and took my cows
incoming hoofbeats dolarhyde looks up to see colorado and the rest of the gang returning from absolution
a woman emerges from the servants quarters
as the men rear nat colorado meets eyes with her
a relationship we dont understand yet as dolar strides up wheres percy
sheriff locked him up
unsheathes a knife
looks down at roy whenre these people gonna lgarn
he stabs the knife down
slicing the rope tethered to roys feet
his lower body slumps to the ground he breathes a sigh dolar slaps the horses rump to which roys upper torso is tied it gallops off dragging a screaming roy
into the night
everyone saddle up
got us a sheriff to kill
as he moves off dolarhydes eyes go to the apache woman
something passes between them
she seems concerned
wasnt the sheriff got him caught
it was a stranger
that stops dolarhyde
he turns back face dark what stranger
usually a man gives off a scent
where hes been
what hes done
he didnt have one
a bullet in close up twirling between the thumb and forefinger of sheriff taggart
boots up on his desk troubled
deputy wade pours himself a cup from a tin pot of coffee percy wouldntve come in shooting without his daddys say so kyle
you best get ready for a war cause thats whats comin
tomorrow we ride the little shit up phoenix way turn him over
dolarhydes got a beef he can take it up with the th cavalry
taggarts on his feet grabs his jacket off the door goddamn tired of this
fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan he stops
something catches his eye on the posting board
yanks a piece of paper off a mixture of confusion and concern sonofabitch
what does he see
before we get a chance to know emmetts face rises into frame peering into the saloon from below a windowsill
sees the man in black at the bar as he slugs back a shot the dog at his feet still eyeing that steak on atticus plate
the man points to his glass another
you drink like a man who wants to forget
haunted the irony other way round
the dog whines again for the steak
atticus slams down his silverware
draws his gun
you got three seconds to get your dog outta here or i blow his balls off
without a blink not my dog
and just before three
atticus freezes because theres a rifle barrel at the back of h is head now give you odds you dont get to three
rack to find the person holding the rifle is a woman
dressed in leather
meet ella swenson
on the man in black
cant help himself
immediate and undeniable chemistry
but she pays him no mind makes a psst sound and the dog snaps to her side
atticus uncocks his gun slowly slides it back in the holster i was just havin some fun miss give him the steak
atticus hesitates angry at the humiliation
ella presses the gun harder against his neck lowering him and his plate to the floor
right in front of the dog who growls now say youre sorry
biting his tongue im sorry
his names happy
happybares his teeth
inches from atticus face im sorry
lowers her rifle youre right
that was fun
atticus scrambles back to his feet and out the door as ella looks at the man in black whatre you doing with my dog
i was hoping you could tell me
the hellre you talking ab
surprise and revelation where
did you get that
before he can answer sheriff taggart enters along with deputy wade carrying a shotgun and other deputies
they move cautiously to the man like hes a powder keg about to go off
hey there luke

all due respect im the law mister
thats what for
the men lock eyes tell you what sheriff
how about you keep the fifty dollars you owe me and i just walk outta here like we
because we did meet
for reasons were not sure of the idea of the man leaving alarms her
all the gunslingers hands are poised by holsters
the man stays preternaturally cool l cant be accountable for what happens if they draw on me
and whats gonna happen
best you dont find out
now whyd you have to go and say that
taggart gives a nod and the men start to converge low genuine plea dont
but charlie makes a move and the man slams his head into a pole the next gunman reaches for his pistol the man punches his throat slams the third into
a bench the fourth straight down on the faro table taggart levels his repeater but the man just grabs the barrel as taggart fires a round into the ceiling now the rifles in the mans hands and just before he pulls the trigger on taggart he sees emmett at the window
about to watch his fathers murder
and the man lowers the gun i told you i dont wanna hurt anyb crack
the butt of a pistol whips the side of his skull
the man drops as we reveal who just knocked his ass out ella
taggart draws a gun and pins the man whipping out that piece of paper he pulled from his office
yup looks just like him
scourge a the territories
wanted dead or alive
and the man
now forever known as jake
stares woozily into his overturned hat
the photo tucked inside of the beautiful woman
her image goes blurry
a tilted handmade trail sign saguaro pass
were in a cabin somewhere
blinding ultraviolet light explodes into the cabin against which a demonic silhouette appears it looks like an indian in full feather headdress
a womans face the woman from jakes photograph she looks at us and screams
now were someplace very dark a cave
as some kind of terrifying ocular probe lowers right in front of our eyes
now were running through the cave escape breathing hard a light at the end of the tunnel blinding sun hits us as we emerge our eyes adjust to see
a strange rock formation on the rim of a canyon like a stone tower pointing to heaven as the sun whitewashes us to jakes eyes open and he gasps air
his pov a face comes into focus percy dolarhyde
grinning at him from the next cell youre a dead
jake sits up
blinking back to reality
my daddys comin for me boy
youre gonna end up another dead shitheel under his spurs
i am gonna watch you suffer for a long long jake moves lightning quick reaching through the bars grabbing percys collar yanking forwards slamming percys head into the bars knocking
him out cold again
jake sits back on his cot rubbing his still throbbing head
a prison wagon pulls up in front of the sheriffs office along with taggarts gunmen on horseback
ella takes frame as the men dismount and head into the office she pursues deputy wade with a real sense of purpose i need to see lonergan
fraid not miss were preppin him for transport
and pushes past her into the office with the men
hold on ella dammit she needs to find a way in there
a key in the lock as the cell door opens sheriff taggart wade the gunmen
glaring at jake then noticing percy what happened to him
man walked into a bar
taggart shakes his head as charlie and a deputy unlock percys cell cuff him drag him out
taggart points to jake step back against the wall there

as he does you shouldve let me go
yeah i shouldve shot you in your knee
you put down six of my deputies
six was all you had
hell theyre gonna love you in phoenix
whats in phoenix

taggart reaches into his shirt pulls out a pair of glasses
slips them on his nose
takes out that wanted poster and reads aggravated banditry counts forgery blackmail hijacking injurious use of a cattle prod arson incitement of whorehouse riot and trespassing with intent to deflower
youre also leader of a gang of outlaws includin creek johnson and bull mccade which makes you accessory to every law they broke too
after a long beat that it
saved the best for last
that lands on jake
wondering if this is true
evenly it say who i killed
prostitute outta mojave name of alice wills
taggart rises removes jakes black stetson from a hook on the wall pulls that photograph of the woman from the inner brim if i were a bettin man id say
this would be ms
wills would it not
jake just stares confused
they found her dead in a cabin round saguaro pass twenty miles west of here
with that a clue falls into place saguaro pass
deed was in your name
he slips the photo back in the brim tosses the hat to jake dead hooker with a hole in her chest in your cabin plus your sterling reputation equals guilty
as goddamned sin
draws his gun and youre gonna hang for it
at gunpoint taggart pushes jake out the door against the rising sun dolarhyde and gunmen ride hard armed to the teems
they rear in the hills above absolution
dolar looks down through binoculars as nat colorado turns to
an incoming wind
across the valley a massive black cloud is starting to swirl
violent blue flashes within
clanton said he saw blue light before the cows disappeared
just a storm
no storm ive ever seen
i say we wait til it passes
but dolar isnt listening
through his binoculars he sees percy being carried into the prison wagon
followed by jake
no time they put him in an iron coach
with a hya
hes off the others following with reluctant looks still spooked by that incoming storm as jakes loaded into the prison wagon after the still unconscious percy he sees meacham through
the barred window
the preacher flashes sympathy as wade takes out the cuff key gimme your wrist
jake holds out his hands
wade unlocks one wrist freeing a cuff
then takes that cuff and locks it to percys wrist
best way to make a man stay put chain him to his enemy
you lovebirds have a nice trip now
slam the door closes and locks
jake sighs and tries to sit back but its hard tethered to percys slumped form
then qww something starts to sting and he looks down his bracelet
has started pulsing red
and its getting warm
jake stares on edge what the hells happening
as outside taggart mounts the buckboard
emmett feeds the horses you sure hes a bad guy pa
he did give percy a lickin
hes bad enough
not so sure but can i come with you
dangerous to drive a damn coach
why cant charlie just take him
because its my job emmett
thats what these people pay me to do
and your mother would kill me if i brought you
emmett looks off half sad half angry good thing shes already dead then
and turns without a goodbye
taggart watches him leave wishing he could connect
takes the reins and looks up reacts that massive
frightening cloud in the sky roiling faster toward town
the scary blue flashes within grow more intense
in the coach with jake looking at the bracelet the pulsing growing more frequent and then a voice jake turns to see ella pushed up against the coach window tell
me where you got that bracelet
maybe you shoulda asked before you knocked me out
i need to know
just tell me where you got it
xbmbgx i don t remember my name or where ive been or any of the things they said i done so leave me the hell alone
and sits back as the coach starts to move leaving ella in the dust
some of the gunmen ride atop it others on horseback cover the coach in a protective ring
wade sees something incoming from the north taggart looks up dolarhydes gang racing down the mountain
he unslings his shotgun as his men ready their weapons on dolarhydes gang riding hard guns ready too this is about to get ugly
from the other end of town the wind picks up as the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have stored at a h its eye churning roaring and
two bolts of blue lightning crack down from it
happy starts barking madly
ella sees the lightning and starts to back away in fear nonono get to your cellars
everyone but her cries are lost as rrrrrrrr
the stagecoach upends flipping sideways as the animals try to break free taggart and his men are thrown inside jake and percy tumble end over end slamming into walls locked
together jarring percy back to consciousness dolarhydes men are thrown from their horses too as the animals stampede off in different directions the q k o engulfs the town
the concussive blast buckles okay wait
take a breath
cause its about
roaring into the town flying just above ground jesus god
strange steel rings fire from the speeders and mushroom out ka ching
snap open and clamp around necks arms legs and from these steel collars cables lash out whip snapping back to the speeders and tethering magnetically to them
yeah these are high tech lassos speeders like roped steer
two of taggarts gunmen

screaming just gone
this is a
emmett stunned as sheriff taggart runs for him emmett runs into his dads embrace whats happening
stay by mvside
a livery stable the horses stamp in their stalls as taggart tears the door open and rushes emmett inside as hes about to follow
am c t lu if a steel cable fires from the collar snaps taut as it connects to a speeder and whoosh
taggarts ripped off his feet dragged away ella tackles the boy as another ring zooms overhead locks around a fleeing woman shes taken with a cmon
she rushes him through the frenzied crowd jake and
mercy trapped in the upside down coach jake sees deputy wade on the ground just a few feet away head bleeding
a metal collar clamps around wade and yanks him away
percy struggles wildly against jake in a tug o war percy relents
offers up his hand
jake grabs all of percys snaps them backwards
percy shrieks as jake kicks him back against the wall forcing percys hand out of the cuff and now jakes untethered too
through the crowd dolarhyde hears his son scream
sees the overturned coach and two finger whistles to colorado
nat colorado races in as dolar draws his
shatters the coach lock they pull percy out as dolar runs for his horse percy sees a pistol left on the ground grabs it with his good hand and fires
at jake who jukes behind the coach for cover percy shooting in a fury but klink
a collar clamps around percys neck and hes yanked off too
dolarhyde turns and sees his son disappear meacham ushers people into the church as walls shake pews jump doc and maria burst in huddle under a window
across the room a young man clamps a hand over his terrified wifes mouth doc leaps after her but her collars lasso cable whips out tethering to a passing speeder
and shes ripped out the door
ella hurrying emmett toward the theaters cellar door but a speeder circles around and roars toward them on jake
he sees this and suddenly to his surprise as much as ours
his bracelet activates
metal coming to life coiling up around his arm what
as it becomes
tracking that speeder as it descends on ella and the mother and ella reaches the cellar door with emmett
sees a hatchet in a stump rips it out and hammers the lock to bits everyone inside
go go go
ushering emmett and townsfolk underground pulls the door shut jake stumbles up
as a speeder fires a ring at him
but reflexively his wrist weapon fires another blast vaporizing it
he looks down at the blaster hell y
another speeder circles around kaboom
the blasters incredible firepower spirals the speeder out of control it the speeder plows through parishioners flee the church bell breaks from the bell tower crashes down on the speeder
as jake keeps firing the last speeders turn tail and retreat disappearing back into the tornado as the cloud overhead opens up and inhales the swirling mass which spirals to the heavens
the massive cloud seems to vaporize and the desert sun returns
as our camera rises to reveal
half the buildings have been
from the rubble survivors emerge emmett and ella from the cellar with inhabitants
al in shock maria oh god they t took her what just
desperate cries as people search for loved ones
jakes blaster retracts folding in on itself shrinks down to size reverting back into a bracelet
so are the remaining townsfolk
dolarhyde is first to speak who the hellre
hes the one who caged percy
dolarhyde starts moving toward jake wild killer eyes whatwere tho se thinae
whyre you asking m
dolarhyde grips jakes arm the bracelet this
whered you get this
it was shooting the same light beams they were let go of my wrist
im not lettin go of nothin til you tell me what the he ka lllang
suddenly that church bell comes hurtling out of the church wreckage plows through debris
and out of the church stumbles
standing upright limbs inverted limbs that drag wounded as people scream and run and jake and dolarhyde can only stare jaws dropped and the monster lunges whupwhup something spinning through
the air a hatchet ella hang iust hurled it
the alien lets out a death rattle then falls forward the hatchet embedding deeper as it hits the dirt
ellas adrenaline dynamo starts to die down replaced now by shock
and for what seems like the first time fear
she exhales a crazy breath stumbles back
people converge around the corpse is it
jake kicks the alien
it doesnt move
happy barks the hell j a it
they all turn to see meacham
revelations for there are spirits of demons showing signs
points to the alien escaped from hell itself

he meets eyes with ella
her face as eager as his to understand this and now
whats that sound
everyone looks at each other
colorado bends closer to the corpse
its comin from somewhere inside it
people look at each other what now
trying to control the near hysteria they all feel
finally dolarhyde takes a breath more bravado than actual courage only one way to find out
we need to cut it open

doc snaps out of his stupor looks up freaked are you

doc looks down at the thing orange goo dribbling around the axe in its head
so you got a bone saw or dont you
the alien corpse is dropped onto the bar by doc and meacham
as dolarhyde and colorado follow through the batwings doc whips a shotgun from under the bar stay outside
youre not welcome in here
dolar brings up his colt so does colorado i own more of this town than any man in it so ill go wherever the hell i damn please
and for the record
you aint welcome in my country mexican
ella steps between them bad ass whatever troubles you had dont mean a damn thing against the ones we got now
we wanna see our way through em your guns better start pointing in the same direction goddammit
doc and dolar never take eyes off each other
or their guns
dolar lowers his
so does doc
meacham slips on a pair of glasses studying eerie veins and muscles through the creatures viscous outer layers
doc turns his focus to the alien too
picks up his pump operated bone saw
presses his boot on the bellows it turns with a whir
shaking as he brings the spinning blade to the aliens chest
looks at meacham afraid if it mss a demon and i cut it open
am i going to burn for it
meacham hesitates a beat then crosses the air in front of doc that should cover ya
brow sweating he brings the spinning blade down toward the disgusting alien vrrrrzz hesitates excuse me
he pukes on the ground
doc wipes his mouth with a handkerchief slightly defiant this is not normal
im entitled to vomit
we should xu be vomiting
just cut lardass
with a still shakitig hand gets back to business and
doc looks up at jake gestures to the carcass senor
you too maricon
the men all grip the chest plate and pull a disgusting crack
everyone turns away scowling emmett wafting the air damn
smells like a dead dogs ass
doc covers his face with his handkerchief as he explores
chet walls partially collapsed
no familiar organs of any kind
course theyre not familiar
just look at this th
suddenly the aliens arm lashes out claws snap open and pin dolarhyde against the wall
everyone tries to pry the claws from his neck but the second doc withdraws his hands from the aliens chest its arm goes limp
dolarhyde drops gasping
and grins at dolars pain
but meacham notices something around dolars neck where the alien pinned him like a ring of dust something on your neck
meacham sweeps a little off dolars neck rubs it between thumb and forefinger
the dust glints under the kerosene lamp ill be damned
they check the creatures hand talons gold flakes underneath em and lots of it
colorado checks its taloned feet down here too
looks to dolar this much ore
could only have come from a digging in a mine
that lands on everyone
but most especially ella
who looks up to see jake reading her in this moment
in the aliens eye is a small flashing light
on off on off in time with that beep beep beep
gimme my scalpel
in macro cu doc cuts into the eye wet squishy sounds as he pulls it from its socket attached to a stringy optic nerve dripping with juice
clamped to the nerve is a metallic orb he takes hold of the blinking orb
it flares to life the light coalescing into a d arrow like hologram
doc removes it from the optic nerve and the hologram disappears whered it go
the helld you do
nothing just pulled it off he reconnects it to the optic nerve the hologram reappears
only works when its touching the creature
colorado moves closer
rainbow light flickering across his face
its a compass
look fiddles with tweezers no matter how you move it it points in the same direction
compasses point north
realizing to jake wests where came from
another puzzle piece falling into place
if youre right whats it pointing to
the rest of em
be my guess
then thats where im goin
he snaps his pistol open loading bullets one of my ranchers said my herd disappeared into the sky
til about ten minutes ago i figured him for a liar
snaps barrel closed nobody takes my cattle
your b was taken too
a flash of something from dolarhyde could that be emotion
but just as fast its gone
almost a throwaway i noticed
what if theyre already dead
theyre not dead
if all they wanted was to kill us they wouldve
looked to me like
they were ropin people
means they need em for something
whatever it is we can either stand here guessin
or go find out
his eyes flash to nat cmon
and they exit
everyone looks at each other working up the courage to face what they know they must
doc grabs his shotgun starts gathering shells if shes alive if theres even a lord hates a coward
but our bullets were useless against those things
other than his wrist gizmo were outgunned and outnumbered
as one by one they turn
who until this point has been mostly silent
but now hes gone from enemy to potential savior in a heartbeat
whoa i got nothing to do with this you got everything to do with it
if you can remember where you got that thing i remember you all wantin me on the end of a damned rope
whatevers happenin heres got nothin to do with me
he looks at her
no he isnt
but he sure as hell wont stay to debate it turns to go mr
the emotion in the boys voice stops jake at the door
my mother died last year
hes all i got
and despite a fleeting moment of sympathy jake darkens kid im the last man you want anywhere near you your pa
or anyone else in this goddamned town
out the door
everyone trades looks then ella follows jake moves fast past blown out storefronts as ella pursues thats it
youre just gonna run away
im walking away
well s w
as he keeps on walking ella picks up a rock wings it at the back of his head whami jake stumbles forward turns around sonova i told you to gyp
ella strides forward picking up another rock on the move whats your damn problem
youre comin with us
im not coming anywhere
and you throw that rock i swear ill wham
the rock glances off his shoulder if youre walkin away from here what the hellre you walking tsq
that penetrates as jake realizes he doesnt really know
and thats the last thing hes gonna admit what the hell are you walkin to lady
cause if i heard right it sounds like suicide to me
now its her turn to pause
just wanna help these people
you wanna help yourself
saw your face light up the minute you knew that thing might lead you to gold
and the fact that hes busted her gets ellas hackles up its not gold i want you dumb sonofabitch its what itll buy me
and whats that
whatever that means its a deep painful longing in her
she stares at him dead on and lookin at you
id bet a silver dollar
its what you want too
with that ella turns and strides off as we hold on jake face knotted in conflict
as her words resonate
was the devil come to absolution
come to drag our town down to hell
series of shots as dusk tai
nigitt though burning embers emmett helps a little girl pull her half burnt doll from the rubble
but our towns not just a buncha buildings brothers and sisters nossir
our town is fie
good god fearing souls
pure and hopeful
and the devil cant never take that away
ella and doc tend to wounded people in a triage area as
meacham finds his overturned pulpit
determination in his eyes he pushes it upright hes standing on the pulpit in the rubble his words a sermon call to arms every survivor gathered around
in times of darkness god asks that we come together so we may stand and fight
so were goin after our kin
any of you arent able or prepared no shame in it
head up to fort huachuca join up with the garrison there and pray
rest of us ride out at sun up to recover that which we have lost
sunrise pistol chambers spinnnn rifles are cocked thy will be done lord and theres an amen behind it
lo and behold most of the town survivors are just too damn scared
they form an exodus line heading off toward the fort
dolarhyde colorado and his remaining men load the alien corpse onto the back of a wagon
some of them trade glances damn worried about staying
dolarhyde sees it somebody got something to say
his withering glare keeps them from speaking up
doc and meacham climb onto the wagon sure we need to bring that thing along
doc nods as he twists the forceps in the aliens eye the compass hologram flickering to life before them if this arrow points me back to maria
yeah jm sure
emmett appears leading a pony a bow and quiver of arrows slung around his back cant come emmett too dangerous
i can protect myself shoot im the only master bowman in my archery club
won the county tournament by shootin a flipped nickel at paces
somethin tells me these things dont carry nickels son
you want me to ride off with the chickenshits then double back be happy to
but lets just skip that part and get to it padre
and thats the truth
meacham sighs no choice
finally go fill your canteen dammit
he slaps the reins and the wagon rides off
emmett grins and mounts the pony then sees
jake riding past
angry eyes from ella as she heels her horse and trots off angrily cmon happy
but happy remains torn between them tail wagging and looking up at jake as if to say please come
oh shut up
suppressing guilt he rides on toward the hills as dolarhyde veers his horse in front of jake cutting him off i was ridin into town to kill you for what
you done to my son
you owe me your life boy
ride with us well call it square
his hand rests on his nickel plated
eyes gleaming cruelly
you that fast
whoosh jakes hand is already up with his own pistol having drawn before dolarhyde can finish his sentence now you owe me y
in a dazzling twirl jake slaps it back in his holster
point made he rides on
dolarhyde burning mad at having been out drawn turns to culobai u speaks low follow him
soon as hes got his back turned
dolar glares do it
finally colorado nods acquiescence moves off
jake on the outskirts of town now riding past meacham and doc on the wagon figure out which way youre headed yet
thats not what i meant
the inference lands on jake
but hes in no mood
meacham watches jake go
music rises as we dissolve through a man running from his demons or maybe toward them
through plains and pasturage
until he sees the tilted road sign saguaro pass
up ahead he sees debris
part of a roof lying broken on the ground
pieces of a stone chimney
jake comes over a rise
to reveal a destroyed log cabin
walls partially torn away
something in jake is deeply stirred
walks up to the porch
boots crunch over broken window glass as they enter light beams stream in
jake takes it in haunted
something crunches under his boot dried flowers
sticking out from an overturned cracked vase
jake blinks affected bends over touches the vase as memory flasecut
fresh flowers in a womans hand
the w b from jakes picture
she smiles at him you shouldnt have
she turns drops the flowers into the vase as we see shes talking to jake
got you somethin else
clink he drops a leather pouch on the table next to the vase
a few gold coins clink out
the woman turns to him worried whered you get this
where do you think
the woman looks to the pouch picks up one of the coins
jake moves behind her
an intimacy here
your boys come after you
but determined let em come
she turns to him their eyes hold
and they kiss
but then a thundercrack turns their attention to the window a storm cloud on the horizon
same kind that consumed the town
the cabin starts to vibrate like a tuning fork
the pouch slides off the table
the gold coins spill out and reeling
what is this memory
who the hell is the woman
something glints in the far wall where the chimney used to be embedded in the wood
jake pulls it out of the wall a thousand questions in his eyes
sunlight shimmers off it and memory flashcut
the spilled coins start sliding across the floor all by themselves as if magnetically drawn to the chimney whoosh
sucked right up into it by some vacuum force
force as ultraviolet light crashes in
the woman screams and she manages to grab a doorknob and dangles upward choking as
a demonic silhouette drops in front of them
jake draws his pistol and fires
the demon shrieks in rage as spiked plumes fan out from its huge elongated skull
making it look like a silhouetted it qiai
l a t ei
its hideous face comes into the light an aijie as it raises its arm wearing a wrist bracelet that reshapes into a jake dives away but a searing pulse rips
a wicked gash in his side now we know how he woke up with it in the desert c mr m
she s hurled backward into the wall jake
cries out alice
as he rushes to her her collar unlocks
and flies at jake clamping hes pulled into the light choking screaming as he stumbles back gasping touching his neck catches his breath
sees alices blood stain on the wall
his shaking hand reaches out brushes over it
trying out the name alice
whoever she was to him he feels sledgehammered with grief
all he knows is it was them
the creatures killed her
and this revelation
well it galvanizes him with rage
rage that gives him new purpose
then the stone hits colorado as he fires the bullet tears past jake as colorado recovers jake bodyslams him the gun goes flying they go hurling through the wall landing
hard on the other side aaballs out
close quarter death match jake takes a punch colorado loops an arm around his throat yanks they tumble slam to the floor jake landing on top of colorado who holds
the arm lock choking the life out of him
jake eyes popping sees the gun just out of reach fingers grasp for it seconds before he passes out he grabs the gun and swings it back blammii
colorado rolls aside as the wall where his head just was blowsopen and jakes on him pistol whipping him mercilesslyuntilhespins the gun back around and points it between colorados eyes
on jake quaking with rage he wants to kill this guy so bad he can taste it
but somethings holding him back grits his teeth cocks the trigger and we cut wide on the cabin as a gunshot cracks
a flock of birds screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field
the rest of our people ride along following the ever tilting holographic arrow their compass floating from the dead aliens eye in the back of the wagon
greavey dolars ranch hand heels up to ella
cocky swagger so
whats a pretty lady like y you finish that sentence i shoot you in your beef whistle
doc sipping from his canteen does a spit take
ellas eyes drill greavey
cut down a peg he tips his hat red faced maam
and rides past her taking us to emmett and dolarhyde tell me somethin kid
why didnt your father just take my money
offered him a thousand dollars to leave town
he coulds taken you outta harms way relocated
found you a new momma
and this just burns emmett
a beat then
is it true percys momma died givin birth to him mister dolarhyde
something flashes in dolarhyde
but hes contained yeah
then maybe you should use that thousand dollars to buy yourself a new wife
emmett holds his look against dolarhydes
brave and unflinching
doc cant help but grin at the kids moxie
but its short lived as his face suddenly falls madre dios
and we pan around dropping over his shoulder to see what hes reacting to an enormous crater
twenty feet deep
even dolarhyde looks nervous now what the
hell is it
it was winfields landing
they turn to see meacham brushing the dust off a wooden sign holds it up
on greavey and the men
he doesnt mean
you tryin to tell me those
things pulled the whole damn town into the sky
and suddenly a weird crack shakes the canyon like the sound barrier breaking everyones look goes up where swirling dark clouds loom
the same clouds that dropped the tornado on absolution
and that appeared in jakes memories at the cabin
but this time somethings shot out from them that cant be good
the plummeting object hits a distant dune kicking up a sand scatter
everyone runs their horses aside as the object bounces over rocks then slows
to a stop
finally dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly
dismounts draws his gun
what he sees is shocking its an oval capsule of blue goo the outer layer some kind of translucent cocoon
suspended within the murky jell o is a ge dec shape
the others draw guns too converging around it in equal shock and fear
but the thing doesnt move
should we open it
hell no we shouldn oops and now we find emmetts already poking it with a stick a small tear in the cocoons outer embryonic layer goo leaks then it ruptures
exploding as the horses rear away whinnying the goo spreads across the desert floor thinning out
everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come face to face with the object inside lying there on the ground motionless
dead in fact
a metal tube jammed in its mouth connected to a valve in the now flaccid bubbles outer shell
greavey notices a branding on the cows rump the letter d boss
its onea yours
dolarhydes eyes narrow
emmett looks at doc scared is is this what happened to my pa
moves to the cows mouth and pulls out that tube with a wet squishing sound
thinking it through this was stuck down its throat
to help it breathe
that means they wanted to keep it alive emmett
forces a small smile im sure your father is fine
but docs eyes arent sure
meacham looks back to the sky
whyd they dump it
whatever they needed from it they mustve got
gonna get dark soon need to keep moving
the others follow in a chilled daze
the last is dolarhyde glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes
now our people appear riding up a ridge
dolarhyde shoots up a hand bringing the caravan to a stop
once again shock ho ly shit
boom up to reveal a surreal sight in the valley below agambling riverboat
nose buried in the sand paddlewheels facing the sky as if itd been dropped from the clouds into the desert
just like that cow
off their looks tracking alongside of the tilted paddleboat our team rides around it
trying to make sense
stenciled on the stern is
the rivers two hundred miles from here
but ella doesnt seem as impressed as the rest of them
in fact her attention is drawn behind them to something coming up over the dunes
the barest flicker of a smile son of a bitch
its jake on horseback
followed by another horse with colorado in the saddle
wrists tied but alive
as jake rides to a stop he pushes colorado off the horse the indian hits the ground with a thud as jake levels dolarhyde with hard eyes your man got
it in his head that he was sposed to kill me
im holding onto his ear til he says sorry
as colorado stumbles to his feet angrily humiliated dolar notices his bloody ear
the lobe has been shot off
he looks up at jake half angry half embarrassed whyd you let him live
jakes hard as nails
driven now gonna need him
he rides past dolar to ella
says simply nice boat
sniffs whats that smell
thatd be me
he realizes her shirts caked in the blue goo from the cow
whyre you blue
cause i missed ya
their look holds
something real between them
we better keep movin
on the horizon sheets of rain
i say we dig in here til it passes
to colorado fucking hows that sound nat
dolar feels his authority being undermined storm or no storm i say we keep movin
colorado finally turns to uolarhyde
defiant too hard tracking anything in the rain
dolarhyde glares at colorado who glares back his loyalty now in question
the tide is turning against the rancher
rain pours on the overturned boat
the alien corpse has been moved onto a slanted deck covered by a tarp
we tilt to the aliens hand
hold on it longer than were comfortable
a rattlesnake is coiled around a chandelier
except the chandelier is on the floor and the floor is the ceiling
upended gambling tables
woodrats scurry over food
every windows smashed
as if something just took everyone
dolar sits by a fire made from furniture parts drinking from a whiskey flask
colorado opposite rubbing his mangled ear
low eyes averted yeah
dolar pours some whiskey on a bandana leans towards colorado lemme clean it for you or itll get im fine
dolarhyde backs away
after a beat is percy worth dyin for
dolars eyes flash
a mixture of anger and pain
then hes my son
i take care of my kin nat
on colorado as that lands
clearly theres something here
a bond that seems to go deeper than just boss and employee
finally nat just gets up and leaves
dolar watches him go takes a healthy swig
hears a whimper
looks over and sees
emmett huddled in a corner
the kids naked emotion affecting him but the fact dolar might have a conscience makes him angry too
emmett looks up sniffles
dolar tosses him the whiskey flask take a drink and shut p
he gets up walks off
leaving the kid with the flask
as emmett looks at it confusedly stuffs it in his pocket meacham has set out tin pans under holes to collect rain water
dumps a pan into his canteen as doc enters with coffee for him re the tin plates we brought enough water
not for drinkin its for blessin
doc nods ah
turns to go
intense eyes padre
maria came to see you in confession every sunday
she had a lot to talk about
beat this is hard was she having an affair
meacham removes his spectacles
looks at doc you know i cant say
and doc does know
but theres a quiet desperation here the last thing i said to her
shakes his head then please
if im wrong about my wife
i dont want to die angry
meacham sees the pain in his friends eyes
you can ask maria if she was cheatin on you once we get her back
bit of a grin dont die
and off doc thunder cracks rain pours down through an open gash in the roof splashing the floor
ella enters glances back toward the door to make sure shes alone then pulls off her shirt and folds it over a stool
upper body naked in the moonlight
we catch only a flash of this and for a moment its pure hotness
until she turns and something else is revealed criss crossed lash marks on her back
she turns away and starts to splash herself with water erasing the blue goo and dirt from her skin and face
then a match ignites behind her
she whirls startled covering her breasts with her arms jake is sitting in a chair at the commodores desk casually lighting a cheroot in his mouth you missed a spot
the hell re you doing here
mindin my own business
snaps out the match then you decided to take a shower
why didnt you say anything
givin you privacy
she throws her shirt on but her skins wet and the shirt glues to her celebrating her shape in a way that cant be ignored
jake tosses her his jacket
as she slips it on she notices a bottle of whiskey on the table
and the photograph of alice
jake says nothing who was she
intense emotion intensely suppressed only thing i knows her name was alice
and shes dead
ella looks up at him
maybe you loved her
jake shakes his head sort of mumble chuckles in resistance all you women are the same always wanna make it about goddamn love
trust me lonergan
im not the same
there is a force a strength about this woman that he connects with
but remains true to character aloof dont matter
she takes a step closer
so what dj matter
jake just looks at her
then lifts the cheroot to his lips the flare of its tip casting him in a demonic light
what matters is i find the thing that killed her
dark as hell and make it pay
and now he leans forward with a focused look
holds up his whered you see this before
ella somehow contained opens her mouth to lie
but he cuts her off and dont lie to me
you wouldntve asked me if you didnt recognize it
pain in her eyes
and jake realizes those things
they the ones who put those marks on your back
she swallows a mixture of shame that hes found her out
and anger at what was done to her
they took my people
destroyed where im from
north of here
been trackin em ever since town to town
best i figure theyre hidin in a mine
jake considers all this
softens a little maybe if youd told me the truth instead of throwin rocks at me what you wouldve stuck around
i couldntve turned you away from what you had to do any more than i couldve stopped these people from going after their kin
truth aint worth a damn jake
and were gonna need all the guns we can get
their look holds
until jake smirks
likes her style so thats the only reason you wanted me to come with you
cause of my gun
theres a pause
then ella smirks back no not your gun
what you do with it
among the many things these two ate feeling both separately and together the one that pops right now is attraction
confusing as it is for him
the pregnant moment lingers
until happy suddenly starts to growwwwl sensing something outside
another crack of thunder as the horses stamp nervously out the window as greavey and the rest of dolarhydes men cobbett and others huddle in secret conference whispers that sound
a lot like mutiny
what the hellre we doin here
we should be ridin in the opposite direction of those things we do that the old mans likely to shoot us himself
only way outta this is and suddenly
greavey sniffs the air frowns whats that smell
as they turn to the deck where the creature lays
all they lightning flashes illuminating the ship and als the alien behind them
a coiled mass clinging spiderlike to the ceiling
its arm whips out noosing around cobbett lifts him off his feet slams him into the ceiling tosses him like a ragdoll the men shout a pair of razor sharp
canines extrude from the alien then it springs slicing through two men at once greavey and others manage to scramble away hear the screams happy takes off they race after him hear them too grabs their pistols and doc his canteen dqirhxpe
owq n colorado snatches up a winchester loads it throws another one to dolar whos suddenly surprisingly protective of emmett get behind me boy the alien springs into the room
landing upside down on the ceiling
dolar fires at it emmett scrambles down a floor hatch disappears as dolar keeps firing but the alien bats the gun away and lifts dolar up
paralyzed with fear he exhales a terrified gasp and the creature recoils from his breath
hurls dolar aside through the fire embers catch curtains and flames spread colorado races in throws a tomahawk it pins the aliens claw to the wall the monster shrieks as
nat draws a pistol but the alien spits a sticky resin gob it hardens pinning nats hand with the pistol to the wall in return
he struggles as the alien advances boom
the aliens shoulder explodes orange fluorescent blood as a gunshot rings out its dolarhyde back on his feet aid firing the monster screeches and leaps down disappearing through the hatch
where emmett fled and the fires growing around the boat emmett moves fast on hands and knees through a narrow crawlspace around a corner here another there a maze emmett reaches another hatch pushes through and out dropping onto the floor as we whip to jake racing in from around a corner but suddenly the alien bursts from the hatch jakes bracelet opens up into that blaster and its aimed at the alien but the creature cups a hand around emmett and lifts him off the floor a taloned finger pressed to the boys throat standoff
ella rushes in
the creature sees her hisses dont know if you understand me
but you hurt that boy and i hurt you
meacham brings his canteen down like a hatchet spraying the alien with holy water
but nothing happens
and then the alien strikes slamming meacham back into a jutting piece the alien springs through a doorway taking emmett with it
ella rushes after it as jake runs to meacham hanging impaled easy now
dont move dammit go after the boy
then you get our people back
get your ass but meacham grabs jake eye to eye
gasping listen up
cause im not gonna be able to say it again pulls jake close god dont care who you were son
only who you mg
with a last rasp meacham dies just as doc races through the growing flames reacts no time to mourn but jake cant let go fury heartbreak doc pulls him away
jake snags the crucifix off meachams neck as hes forced out leaving meachams body to be consumed by flames the boat is a ball of fire in the pouring rain as what remains of our heroes stumble out coughing devastated
jake doc dolarhyde colorado greavey gunmen
and ella and happy atop a dune following a trail of fluorescent orange blood streaking into the desert
happy barking madly
ella drops to a knee touches the orange blood as it washes away in the rain
it was d ead
dolarhyde rain pouring down his face
vulnerable and guilty i couldnt stop it it just
grabbed the kid
rage filled against the flames
meachams crucifix in his hared as his fist closes around it
looks up hardcore then wed better get him back
stalactites loom from the ceiling bam
emmett is dropped on the floor of a sinister cave scrambles back from the alien damn
you are one ugly bastar psst
the alien spits a resin gob on emmetts mouth psst psst
more gobs pin his limbs to the wall
emmett cant move cant speak eyes wide and terrified the creature looks down at an armor plate on its bicep
touches a series of keys and the armor spits out what looks like
a small rubiks cube made of some alien alloy
the creature casually tosses it in the air where it floats and starts to spin as it does its sides flip and turn like a rubiks cube emitting high pitched
sonar beeps this things some kind of homing beacon
off emmetts wide gaping eyes
our people ride fast against the rising sun on the hunt for emmett
colorado rears his horse kneels by a trace of orange blood on some rocks
looks off west
greavey and the others share a look
e o turn to dolar
boss only took one of them things to kill four of us
we got no chance here
dolarhyde burns knowing hes being abandoned youre a goddamn coward
to the others you work for me dammit
youre my m e qyees
and greavey finally free to speak his mind says spitefully fine line between a coward and a fool
the men turn tail and ride away
dolarhyde shouts after them youre all fired
doc takes the opportunity to twist the knife looks like they finally found something to be more scared of than you
dolarhyde feels his world crumbling away man by man
ella trots alongside jake whos staring at that dark cloud mass overhead with a bad feeling cloudsve been moving east since sun up
cept that one
we sense she knows something something more she isnt saying
snaps her reins and they ride off as the group gallops into a box canyon happy starts barking madly the horses slow blamblan gunshots from above suddenly pepper the ground
the horses rear and kick up startled a dozen figures on the cliffs all around them
badass outlaws with rifles aimed at our heroes
one of them calls down
slowly jake draws his gun
now the rest of them
as they see two riders incoming from the other end of the canyon
rifles aimed and ready
one of the outlaws knocks back the hammer on his rifle i say we just shoot em and take their but the words catch in his throat as his eyes
sure enough theyre looking right at bronc jake
both outlaws and hunt lower their guns hostility replaced by surprise what the hell you doin back here lonergan
this is jakes gang
all registering it
and jake of course doesnt remember these men as bronc dismounts nervous jesus boss
creeks gonna shit when he sees you
then re the others and who the hellre they
now does he handle this
ht nt rides up next to him suspicious and for reasons yet to be known unfriendly whats the matter jake
cat got your
smacki jake moves lightning fast slaps hunt across the face stopping the question on his tongue catches the gun as it drops and presses the barrel into hunts neck since
whenre qy the one asking the goddamned questions
ella and our people react as jake plays it up beat defense a good offense
the outlaws are scared this is the lonergan they know
hunt holds his bloody mouth
you broke my tooth quit whining
now bring me to the rest of the boys if that meets with your goddamn approval
bronc and hunt nod mounting up shouting to the outlaws above as they ride off dolarhyde looks to jake and mutters nice company you keep
what the hellre you doing
if we dont catch up to that kid were never gonna they called me boss
you wanna go after these things with five or fifty
off her look like you said we can use every gun we can get
that actually makes sense
but what exactlyre you gonna say to em
tell you when i figure it out
and he spurs onward leaving her to follow uneasily our alien hangs upside down from stalactites by four spindly limbs
mid sleep cycle
and inches below its head
emmett still webbed to the wall
unable to move or speak terrified
the cube deactivates
and drops the creatures eyes snap open
it springs from the ceiling as four dark shapes blot out light gliding in
a gang of four more aliens dismounts
the biggest and strongest their leader barks guttural clicks at the alien who kidnapped emmett
kidnapper explaining as it removes another strange device
the device beams a holo projection
of ellas face
the aliens hiss in furious recognition
is this some kind of otherworldly wanted poster
plumes fan out angrily from the leaders huge elongated skull like an indian headdress
the creature turns to emmett its the alien who killed jakes woman
well come to know it as
it moves ominously for emmett grasping the handle of something that uncoils with fluid frightening speed a white hot laser whip
this will be the slavers signature weapon
it spirals to its full length flashing out at emmett muffled scream
the whip doesnt cut him instead it slices through the webbing that pins the boy to the wall
as emmett falls the slaver sweeps him up emmett flails punching kicking to no avail but then tumbles from emmetts pocket and splashes whiskey on the slaver it
s iriem wildli aa the booze contacts flesh skin smoking
emmett tumbles away
terror turns to revelation as he pulls the webbing from his mouth holy shit
another alien lunges for the kid but emmett splashes him with the flask the alien recoils flesh bubbling emmett whirls sees the hoverbikes jumps onto one twisting desperately at the
controls iion do i t this turns wo
another alien scuttles in fast emmetts scrambling boots slide into the foot supports which automatically whir closed as the bike throttles forward
decapitating the alien
the bike spins uncontrollably plasma thrusters scorching walls and setting two more aliens ablaze
the speeder kamikaze bounces out of the cavern at mph emmett screaming
the slaver screeches furiously as the remaining creatures leap back on their speeders and give chase
climbing onto an old desert stump blam
its shot off by a couple drunk outlaws swigging booze from stolen whiskey crates piled on a wagon
were in an outlaw camp roughly fast guns and saddle tramps
and right now most of them are gearing up to ride out for some reason
one of them creek johnson with a chewed up face like swiss cheese slides a rifle into his saddle and shouts to the drunks hey i s lay off that
whiskey and saddle up
flyers on its way and we best damn be sober for it
creek turns sees hunt and bronc crest the hill with the other outlaws from the cliffs
angrily bout time you got back
re hunts bloody nose what the hell happened to you
hunt nods over his shoulder he did
the outlaws part to reveal jake riding in with ella and the rest of our people
creeks eyes narrow not happy to see him well shit
it gets very very quiet
our people tread warily knowing whatever reaction jakes eliciting it aint good
he runs the gaunt of accusing glares
smart enough to know that creek is the man in charge
dismounts you dont look happy to see me creek
creek eyes him
clearly history here were fixin to rob us a train in about twenty minutes and you come ridin in like nothin ever happened
i aint happy to see you
how to navigate bad blood that he doesnt remember
well im sure youll get over it
then pretty much dismissing creek jake turns addresses the rest of the men
if hes their boss
i ta nice to see you boys but were not going after a train were going after something else
the men seem
not sure what the hell is going on
you you said you didnt wanna be in charge no more
and this is a revelation
jake glances at ella has to keep improvising to hold his ground well i changed my mind
so saddle the hell up
theyre not going anywhere with you
creeks heard enough
strides forward a direct challenge you got some balls on you walkin outta here a week ago sayin what you said and doin what you did and then ridin back
in here and givin orders
just who the hell do you think you are
the irony of the question isnt lost on jake as creek walks right up to ella
violates her space studies her with a mixture of curiosity and contempt
are you her
am i who
the whore jake quit this gang for
another piece of the puzzle falls into place jakes eyes snap to ella as they both realize
the men think shes e
jake does his best to stay cool meets creeks stare watch your mouth creek
these boys are with now
jid in charge
you may be fast but you are goddamned outgunned
jake turns to the men that a fact boys
but creek doesnt wait for them to respond put your guns on the whore
he so much as twitches blow her brains out her ear
at once guns are leveled at ellas head
no doubt as to who the men are loyal to
but jake locks into creek unflinching call her a whore again thatll be the last word you ever say
you aint in no position to make threats asshole
hunt take his gun
hunt reluctantly scrambles over to jake oh so carefully pulls the pistol from jakes holster sorry boss
creek now turns to bull mccade roughly the size of a barn
put him down bull
and jake barely has time to react as bull lets fly with a jawbreaking haymaker that about knocks jake out of his bootsi dolarhyde and colorado wince as jake hits
the dirt with a thud creek striding over cock of the walk leans over him where the hells our gold
jake spits blood defiant dont remember
creek nods to bull smash
another devastating blow
on ella at gunpoint
wishing she could intervene
well i dg remember you tellin us you was leavin us high and dry because you were in love
you just left out the part about taking half our goddamned haul from the yuma bank
so im gonna ask you one last time where
bull punches jake so hard he flies off his feet man cant run away from who he ja lonergan
you really think you could go straight just cause you were fool enough to fall in love with some woman
bull punches jake back into oblivion and on the hit we memory flasecuti peaceful silence two faces staring at each other across a pillow jake and alice naked in a
whorehouse you sure you wanna give it all up
but just as clearly in love
what about you
once were gone you aint ever comin back
she touches his face so gently
and whispers youre the first person ever believed i was better than this place
so i gotta believe in y
and she kisses him youre a good man jake lonergan
present as the words good man echo back to jake
stir g az n as creek grabs jakes hair and yanks back rears up a fist you figgered you could steal from us
all that gold was yours to take co you could go off and start a new life
creeks next punch takes us to another tory flasecuti replay jake and alice in the cabin he drops the saddlebag it clinks to the floor
shes worried your boysii come after you
dark determined let em come
back to present as now jake understands the context of this moment what they were saying to each other he looks up at creek beaten and busted up okay
okay i remember now
fuck you grin demons stole your gold creek
but when you get to hell you can ask for it back
thats the way you wanna do this
kill the whore
on the gang
as they all cock their guns aimed at ella this is it jake slowly lifts his head suddenly rage filled as everyones faces
jake spits on the around between the smoking boots that formerly belonged to creek told you not to call her that
as he turns his weapon on the rest of the awestruck gang through bloody teeth youre all riding with me
any one of you decides otherwise
so help me god ill kill you where you stand
im j acj and im in goddamne
d the gang quickly flips absolutely jake whatever you say boss
jake turns to the speechless bull mccade and kicks him in the balls as hard as he can doubling him over
now he meets eyes with ella
she cant help smirking grateful
is the only one not looking at jake
his attention drawn toward a sound coming from the distant dunes dios mio
its the kid
as emmett roars in the shocked outlaws scatter the kid tumbles off the speeder as it plows right through camp kicking up dirt and upending supplies
as emmett scrambles up those who have their wits about them fire back trying to hit the flying machines
his speeder growls to a halt
dismounting like a killer biker
as he sees that horrible alien face across the crowd quick bit alice dying in his arms
and this same damn thing is the one responsible for it
and were back to present
jakes eyes locked on the slaver as he says you
outlaws start firing at the slaver who reacts in mere annoyance
flicks open a pouch on his bandolier for what look like thumb tacks throws them and they tan out piercing the necks of the outlaws activating blue ntly e ze
tur an the slaver draws a rol that telescopes into a six foot lance ka tching
barbed ends snap out and the alien runs on two limbs then four leopard like for speed rises back up and smash
shatters each man into a million pieces
now he uses the bladed ends to skewer five more outlaws and turns
jake fires his pulse blaster providing cover as dolar doc emmett and ella rush to hide behind the wagon
the aliens fire back as laser crossfire shreds the camp explosions and chaos three outlaws scramble to form a gatling crew
it spins to life mowing down tents as they try to hit the aliens hurls a boomerang like smart weapon
it circles past the gatling cowboys back into the aliens hand as an explosion blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon ella reacts what
as an alien skitters toward her she grabs a bottle and hurls it it explodes all over the creature
a horrible screech as its skin smokes thrashing epileptically oh my god our people escape for the horses
doc climbs up on the wagon buckboard and pulls emmett in the seat beside him as ella leaps on a horse climbs back on his speeder and guns for her
firing a steel collar jake turns sees this
starts running madly
too late ka chank
the collar clamps her neck ripping ella off her horse
the cable snaps back and attaches to the hovercraft as it zips by dragging ella backward like a water on jake fury his bracelet activates
and theres a logic here well come to realize as he kicks his horse into a gallop ellas dragged behind the speeder
hands grasping at the magnetic collar as it half chokes her yet keeps her upper body suspended just oft the ground while her heels bounce harshly riding hard aims his
blaster trying to get a target on the cable linking ellas collar to the speeder fires misses
the slaver tilts vertical to fly through a narrow canyon entrance as ellas fingers reach wildly for the bowie knife on her belt
she starts cutting the cable trying to free herself whoosh
the speeder blasts out the other side of the canyon jake still in pursuit but suddenly
right for them
this is the train jakes gang was gonna rob
two pinkertons sit by a safe
look up at an unidentified roar you hear
how many times i gotta tell you leonard
no oned be stupid enough to rob this tr when the pinkertons snap around ellas gone
but now they see jake on horseback flashing past in pursuit
they draw guns running to see whats happening and
as the speeder skims alongside the train ella keeps struggling painfully to cut her collar cable
jake fires again misses the cable but detonates the side of a train car the wall explodes inward on the pinkertons hurt but alive the speeders shaken
the slaver growls as he fights for balance
reaches the trains end skims past the caboose and in for cover behind the other side of the tmina t
j through a slot between boxcars the speeder blurs in the opposite direction
up ahead comes the caboose
no more train thinking fast jake leaps off his horse catches a ladder rung on the caboose
teeth gritted starts to climb up onto jake jumps from car to car over logs in a tender car blam blam
the pinkertons are climbing to the roof weapons firing jake loses footing rolling off the side but catches another ladder rung and he dangles looks down she grunts with exertion
as their fingers graze each other and the slaver snaps around
hurls a smart disc at jake no choice he lets go of the ladder hits the ground painfully sxlsklish
the disc vivisects them then circles back around cutting the iron straps that secure the logs in the tender car
it spirals end over end crashing into the desert
he picks himself up wincing
sees the smoking wreck in the distance
starts to limp then run jake appears through the smoke
no sign of the slaver
then falling rocks turns his look upward
though wounded the alien is scaling a rock face
a look that says next time
then in a blur its gone
jakes blaster reverts into a bracelet
when the smoke clears ella is revealed on the ground thrown from the speeder
jake reacts eq takes her in his arms
she desperately tries to say something
but goes limp
her head just falls back
hard to swallow but its true
and if this moment echoes jake holding his dead wife well thats just fine
he stares beseechingly as
the rest of our people gallop in colorado dolarhyde doc and emmett in the wagon aw no
jake looks up unhinged we need to get out of here not
not gonna leave her here l re
xam im not leavin her
this is apache territory
they catch us theyll kill u thhhhhhhunki the air screams as an arrow pierces the ground inches from jakes hand
suddenly thirty more all around them forming an instant circle perimeter as apache warriors flash downhill
dolar dismounts swings emmett to the ground nobody move
jake and emmett freeze
the apaches are all around them
bows and tomahawks drawn off this
the sun dips behind the mountains
close on ellas dead face
find jake on his knees beside her hands bound in front of him
an indian woman finishes wrapping the body in a shroud and leaves
jake is alone
something rising in him
something he couldnt face
until this moment
i remember now
i i did love her
and just saying it saying those words brings a swell of emotion to the surface
but he fights it
a losing battle as his eyes well she was like you
seemed to think i was a good man
finally voice almost but i couldnt save either of you
his bound hands gently touch her face
wheres the good in that
his eyes close
im sorry ella
and that sits
then suddenly jarringly three more braves roughly enter pull jake up force him out ban
our people are thrown to their knees in a large circle of apaches
guarded by warriors with tomahawks and whoosh
a pyre is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about ella being dead the braves carry her roughly past hes yanked back and held in place as
ellaig body is thrown right into the flames
jake helplessly watches her burn
wasnt your fault mr
were lookin for her
had a picture and everything
that breaks the spell
jake looks over what dyou mean
floatin like that arrow thing we found in its eye
before jake can makes sense of this a teepee smoke flap opens and out steps the tribes sachem
this is grey wolf dark wrinkled face enhanced by tattoos
he takes one look at his prisoners and speaks a few words of apache
whatd he say
and make it quick
doc is amply freaked
turns to jake as five of the braves move for them menacing nowd be a good time to use your gun bracelet my friend
but jake is vacant
all the fight seems gone from him
his bracelet doesnt move
dolarhydes grabbed first
pulled forward by one of the braves raising his tomahawk theyre really gonna kill him surprised looks from just about everyone in the camp besides colorado as we realize dolarhyde
just spoke apa on grey wolf intrigued as he approaches dolarhyde how is it that you speak our language
because im a damn genius
grey wolfs fascinated this man has the audacity to be a wiseass given his circumstances
turns to the brave with the tomahawk
forget about quick
make him feel it
the brave nods raises the tomahawk again but dolar interrupts two hundred head of cattle
grey wolf holds up his hand halting the braves death blow ill have two hundred head of cattle u a here in a days time if you let me go
on grey wolf
and how do i know youll come back
dolarhyde nods to colorado you can keep my associate here
if i don t come back you can kill him
hes the only one here who knows what the hell these two are saying to each other as grey wolf approaches dolar looks right into him why should i believe
that you even care about this man
dolarhydes eyes flash emotion
then because hes my son
didnt see that one coming
grey wolf levels colorado with those unyielding eyes is this true
and colorado answers in english for the benefit of the others yeah
hes my father
and so three hundred head
dolar looks to colorado who wont meet his eyes
his fathers eyes
turns back to grey wolf hard
hold on grey wolf for a beat
then cut him loose
the brave does exactly that
dolars free to go
a flash of regret
but its gone fast
what about you kid
and he just walks out of the camp leaving his son behind
and now its back to business kill all of them except the half breed
our people are grabbed
jakes yanked forward pinned down a brave raises a hatchet to kill jake who glares back with lunatic eyes
ready to die
almost wanting it whatre you waiting for asshole
and as jakes about to meet his death except she isnt exactly ella
shes a humanoid incredibly close to us in physical appearance her features acutely feminine yet
the apache kneel in prostration dropping weapons as flames dissipate off ellas backlit form
her skin returns to human flesh tone
when she finally stops she looks like the ella weve come to know and love
stands there what
everyone else equally stunned
ella looks around
fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her
off ella whos got a helluva lot to explain a deerskin shirt slips down over ellas naked body
a dark breechcloth is tied
she turns to us
beautiful as ever
ella emerges to find
and for a long moment nothing is said
until she takes a step toward him if id told you on the boat you never woulda trusted me but he takes a step back
if hes relieved shes alive he isnt showing it did you hear what i said
when you were playin possum
did you hear what i mid
yes even embarrassed
and because of it something has shut down in him again
that killer look is back
i was mendin
its like sleep
his eyes narrow trying to understand hows it you look like one of us
i can look like whatever i want to
so you cant die
sure i can
if my heart stops beating
just like you
youre nothin like me ella
youre onea them
we can see that hurt her
but she deserved it too
so desperately wants to reach him
im not jake
im from a different place
he isnt sure what that means
can he even trust her
either way she has answer
darkly the one that took you
it killed her
that lands on her
knowing and painful
they call him the slaver
hes the one gave me the scars
and made me watch
while he killed my family too
even with his guard up
jake cant help but be struck
as the sound of howling wind takes us to a sandstorm
through which a ghostly figure materializes
moving with angry purpose toward the canyon bluff
as he looks down into it we hear the sounds of machinery below
but we do qt
yet reveal what it is he sees
he stalks down leaving frame as we hold on the field of for every drop of light in the sky theres another world
filled with life
ellas in front of the campfire surrounded by everyone
our race was first to map the stars
thats why they came for us
took our planet piece by piece
slaughtered anyone who fought hack
ones who survived were turned into slaves
she says this meeting the eyes of grey wolf
theres immediate simpatico here a story the indians could be telling
they brought me aboard one of their scout ships a ship with only one purpose to find other planets like mine
planets they can take
people they can enslave
as the terrible gravity of all this hits everyone jake is first to understand
x lead em here
wracked with guilt
well damn lady thanks a
i never wanted this
an emotional beat but they got
of making you do things
her eyes are haunted with memory
the inference is some kind of torture
she pushes it away staying strong been tryin to make it right
tried to blow the ship to hell by burnin up all their fuel then escaped down here
cept it didnt work
damn thing survived
where is it
jakes determined hes got his own agenda
ella looks up to that ominous cloud
those blue light flashes ripple within hiding in that cloud
way i figure theyll find enough fuel to leave by tomorrow midday
then theyll bring back the others
the whole fleet
theyll take what they need
everyone on this planet
anything too weak to survive
like that cow
this is bad bad news
whatd you mean theyre looking for fuel
and before ella can answer jake already gets it gold
thats why theyre in a mine
nods solemn wherever it is thats where you escaped from and its the only way back up to the ship
even with your memory wiped your instincts kicked in thats how it works jake the bracelet reads your impulse you wanna fight it reacts
somehow you took it off one of em
dont you remember any of it
as he looks down at the bracelet and memory flasbcutsi replay pov as were held down in that cave the terrifying ocular probe lowers right in front of our eyes
one of the aliens starts to activate the probe it begins to flash steadily hypnotically puvtng our mind but our arm manages to break free a blade hidden in our sleeve we slash off the
aliens hand grab the bracelet off its severed limb it coils around our wrist and activates blam slam
we blast the creature to oblivion were free
jake in present eyes alive with memory i i blasted my way out
memory flashcuti replay pov as we run through the cavern escape a light at the end of the tunnel blinding sun hits us as we emerge our eyes adjust to
that strange rock formation high above on the edge of a canyon the stone tower pointing to heaven jake in present the sequencing is complete for him now i remember
seeing a tower
made of stone
on the rim of a canyon
upon hearing that grey wolf suddenly speaks in animated gestures pointing north
colorado reacts what
whats he sayin
colorado turns to jake a flicker of hope that rock youre talkin about
he knows where it is
the slaver enters the gloom of an underground cavern
two aliens melt from the dark to greet him with frightening hisses
we hold on the walls as something glitters gold
close on sheriff taggarts reflection in murky water
as we tilt up to reveal him hanging upside down
eyes flutter open
hes seen better days
turns his head slightly
drifting over to see maria
gravity pulling her hair downward
mostly scared fantastic
stuck to the ceiling over a water grotto
the whole town of absolution is here
a hundred others from the now cratered town of winfields landing feet embedded in the orange resin
suddenly percy dolarhyde sees a terrifying shadow spread across the wall what looks like a huge coiling snake but what comes around the corner is a long metal tentacle
a scanning mechanism on its tip shoots out a blue triangular beam itemizing specimens selecting one sheriff taggart
mechanized talons open up taggart screams as hes plucked from the ceiling like an apple from a tree another metal tentacle slithers in and grabs wade swinging our men across
the cavern where we reveal
the tentacles are attached to a terrifying alien machine
taggart and wade are pinned down on what looks like an operating table
as they thrash restraining clamps enfold their skulls
an ocular probe looms q
them this is the image e
a bem seeing
this is what harpened to him before he escare
worker bee aliens adjusts the device over their eyes instant x rays read their retinas hypnotic as the men grow docile and limp despite their fight and flashflashtlashi the probe
has erased their minds
now the machine arms slip the men into separate translucent capsules
metal breathing tubes are implanted down their throats as the capsules begin to fill with a thick blue liquid
this is the same blue goo a protective gel that housed the cow in that jettisoned cocoon in the desert
more worker bees load the cocoons into transport shuttlecrafts
we see containment holds filled with bleating cows and rearing horses
all going through a similar cocooning process
all of this is overseen by the slaver who stalks up a ramp behind the cocoons
the craft hums to life undergear retracting as it roars off down the tunnel
our people ride up a rocky slope with a few apaches
grey wolf looks around and speaks colorado translates this is kiowa land their sister tribe
as they near the bluff jake sees the stone tower
dismounts thats it
as they near the bluff they hear the growing sound of that machinery
everyone dips low peering over to see
what looks a whole lot like a cavalry fort in the canyon below amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels
except this fortress is made of some kind of alien alloy glowing impossibly bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun
drilling machines are chewing deep into the earth mining for massive receptacles are filled with huge chunks
aliens move in and out working as if from an ant hive
like a damn fort
grey wolf looks to his men grave crestfallen as he realizes the kiowa
they were taken too
suddenly the roof of the steel structure blossoms open like a chrome lotus
the shuttle transport flies out of the canyon rising into the dawn sky
way they get people and gold back and forth to the ship
place is crawling with those things
well never even get close
grey wolf speaks he says theres a back way in
the twin rivers run underneath this whole canyon
limestone tunnels up by the falls couple miles east
lead right down there
jake looks to the sky
hes up in that big cloud
ella nods hard
off their shared determination our score rises
a drum cadence that suggests a mission starting to form doc
skeptical eyes narrow staring at jake and ella surrounded by our team and the apaches back at the apache camp
just so i got this straight
three of those things just kicked the shit out of your entire gang took our whole town and now you twore gonna ride right into that fort try to hijack
onea those he pauses on the word transports
ride it up to that space boat spaceshp
then bring it down here and get everybody off alive
thats your big plan
jake and ella share a look
and just how do you figure on getting in there in the first place
poke a hornets nest
they swarm atcha
you gotta draw em out
buy us a distraction
a long beat of incredulous do you believe this shit stares you want us to storm that fort
against those things
with less than fifty men
it aint its been done
i read at school how ethan allen and his green mountain boys took fort ticonderoga they werent but a small garrison and they were outgunned we need all of you
to make a stand
its the only way
make a stand with what
jake turns to the wagon they rode from jakes gang camp the whiskey crates
sweeps up a bottle this
an impossible mission
yet for the first time
they have an advantage
emmett cuts the moment with a big grin hell yeah
lets squish some bugs
grey wolf chuckles murmurs
jake looks to nat for translation somethin funny
that you whites finally know what it feels like to face extinction
now that were on the same side he says we can all die together
theyre with us
the look holds between them guess that means youre not waitin for your dad to come back
colorados face clouds
years of anger and resentment been woodrow dolarhydes son my whole life
first time he ever copped to it was to save his own ass
not without emotion hes not comin back
and as colorado turns away the percussion finds another gear pieces of cloth are ripped stuffed inside the whiskey bottles
emmett works with apaches and their kids roping wood together to build ladders and catapults
war paint is applied to faces in dark streaks
jake slips on his coat
sees emmett lead a horse to mount up with his bow and arrow quiver not you kid
aw hell we been through this
ya cant stop me
jake draws his gun spins it in his palm aims at emmetts foot i can shoot you in the foot
bu i shit
jake sighs bluff called
holsters the gun and takes a knee
but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment he grabs emmett by the collar pulls him close you told me your daddys all you got left
want me to save his ass
then park yours right there on the ground you little shit
angry but knows hes gotta stay
jake releases him
happy moves to ella but she tsks stay with the kid happy
the dog whines but complies moving next to emmett
jake climbs on his horse
looks back to the boy now he ia tender ill get your father back
bastard still owes me fifty dollars
the hint of a smirk
long enough for emmett to smirk back
ella doc and colorado mount ap too along with a man apache war party
jake meets eyes with grey wolf youll be ready
grey wolf nods
some part of the plan we have yet to learn
and now jake starts to trot off ella beside him
this plays just between the two of them
thats a nice thing
what you said to the boy
i didnt know better id say you got yourself a sweet side
but jake turns to her deadly serious theres nothin sweet about me
i told that kid what he needed to hear so he wouldnt get in my damn way
all i care about is killin that thing
and ella reacts to the darkness in his voice
shakes her head i dont believe that
well believe it
i was playing a part
straight at her just like you were
he cracks the reins riding ahead
hold on ella
who finally follows as they all ride out and music soars thundering hooves but its dolarhyde on his horse
rears near the servants quarters moving fast toward a small hut a hatchet is embedded in a wood pile
dolarhyde yanks it out
the apache woman we saw in the drawn and quartered scene earlier is washing clothes on a basin board
she turns as dolarhyde enters
a menacing figure with a blade in the doorway
she stands alert in subtitled apache what are you doing
without response he levels the axe and slams it down on the floorboards
wood chips spray until a gash is opened
dolar reaches in
pulling out a canvas bag
a few coins spill out
he picks them up looks at the woman need it to save nat
and now her worry becomes fear english now is he okay
hes gonna be
a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes
that stoic dolarhyde veneer starts to crack
just a hint
as the woman moves to him
and touches his face
and he lets her
we realize this woman is colorados mother
dolarhyde for all his wicked bluster loves an apache
i wont let anything happen to him jenny
come back to me
with that hes gone with the gold
leaving her full of dread
a cascading waterfall flows over rock face into the twin rivers
the water curtain covers a cavern entrance
the back way in
jake ella doc colorado and the apaches cross slippery rocks and push through the water
behind the curtain they shake off the wet and remove torches from waterproof buffalo hide pouches
firelight as our team creeps along in a column
jake glances at colorado you and percyre brothers huh
your momma and dolarhyde we friends now
last i checked you shot my ear off
a beat then want it back
colorado grumbles pushes ahead of jake
a buzzard picks at the ear of a dead gang member
more birds scavenge the dismembered remains of jakes crew as the rest of its living members roughly tend wounds and get ready to move on
one of them looks up
and sees an incoming rider on the horizon bronc and hunt look up
draws their guns
so does the rest of the gang
until they see the riders waving a white flag
as he comes closer they realize its dolarhyde one of them fellas jake was ridin with
dolarhyde rides into camp rearing in front of guns the hell you want
its about what you want
he reaches into his pocket and tosses bronc a gold coin lonergan stole your gold
thats a taste of what i got moren youve ever seen
its all yours if you help me get my boy back
the men trade looks
bronc eyes the coin
alight with greed whos got your boy
well theres the rub
i got two
off that our team has travelled far into the bowels of the cavern
jake stops torchlight reflecting the gold in the cavern walls
doc cracks off a piece
in case we live through this
they sneak on down the narrow shaft til theyre funneled into
where our townspeople were hanging
around the corner the sound of engines powering up
a dozen worker bee aliens try to corral the horses from the pen cruelly jabbing the animals with alien cattle prods
the mares rear and whinny
were never gonna get close to that ship
glistening shape rises un from the water behind them
swaying like a cobra ready to strike our people turn
the tube alien snatches one of the apaches swallowing him in its thorny snout
the indian screams lights a whiskey molotov hurls it at the creature boom
it keens burning spitting out the apache
alerted the dozen aliens by the transport swarm at our heroes
c g that shuttle
colorado readies his tomahawk jake meets his eyes knew there was a good reason i didnt kill you
just thinkin the same thing
the men trade fateful looks
then the indians hurl molotovs at the charging horde kaaa boom
aliens twist and scream the apaches strike fearlessly but the aliens quickly recover and shake them off tearing most of them to shreds
the horses break free and crash madly through the cavern and this is the distraction jake and ella need to make their run for the transport up the loading ramp
ella slams a switch and the ramp draws up
jake freezes cocoons hang all around filled with motionless human beings
jake he can only stare she slaps open an engineering hatch drops down a ladder
he takes a last awful look and slides down after her the ladder funnels into the cockpit
ella starts tapping the console and holo displays appear alien text rotating graphics
she slides into a seat strap in
ella jams a lever forward and the shuttle rises
jake grabs webbing that must be some type of seatbelt feeling the sensation of ellqu as ella pilots the ship upward thrusters belching a wake of fire that scorches cavern
walls and incinerates aliens
as a horse streaks by colorado grabs a hunk of mane leaps on doc comes running frantically colorado pulls doc up onto the horses bare back no easy task with
the remaining apaches commandeer horses and gallop hard down the tunnel two aliens jump on manta speeders in pursuit
jake has never moved this fast barely avoiding walls as ella expertly pilots the ship
left right sideways up ahead dim light spills from a fissure leading above ground hold on
she cranks back and the ship pitches upward the shuttle bursts out into the canyon and skates the rim
jake fights the g forces and teeth rattling turbulence as the craft keeps spiralling up up toward
the ominous cloud
as we come closer an impossibly blue glow blinds us the shuttle blasts through the upper cloud layer to reveal
enormous and threatening like a black metal claw
cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane
like ice down her spine
as we drift back to jake
trying to find a word to describe this thing
finally sheee it
the rest of our heroes gallop fast out the criss crossing tunnels ka chinnng
apaches are clamped with steel collars and yanked off their horses as the speeders roar in from behind
colorado veers toward a light as doc ignites a molotov and they gallop out into daylight rigb t through the center of the fort doc throws his molotov and boom
aliens go flying on fire
doc throws another molotov clearing a path for colorado to ride hard for the forts ft
steel entry gates
which start swinging closed to trap them
but at the last second the horse slips through the narrow opening as it thunders closed
now the aliens are pissed off they start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit
a few mount speeders and launch as our guys ride down the canyon trench colorado and doc zig zag around curves like mice navigatinga maze so the speeders cant get
a clear shot theyre gaining on us
thats the point
and just when it looks like doc and colorado are goners
an explosion rocks the canyon as something hurtles down from above whiskey molotovs fired from the handmade catapults
aliens are vaporized shrieking
a cloudburst of flaming arrows brightens the sky as apaches rise up along the canyon rims a ambush
an assembly line of squaws works like a drill team soaking whiskey rags and wrapping arrows
among them emmett and happy
the kid pocks an arrow like a damn expert ignites it lets it fly whoosh
it skewers a speeder pilot who bursts into flames the speeder corkscrews into another one both exploding caught off guard with no wm to turn around as from the opposite
end of the canyon a bellowing war whoop crash
the apaches hurtle into the flank of aliens
lasers are met with the crack of rifles and hatchets the apache leader spurs his horse onward leading men toward the alien bunker
an explosion consumes frame becoming the plasma fire of the shuttles burners as it roars toward the alien ship
a speck against the behemoth the shuttle sweeps past the command centers polarized window where
the slaver watches with evil eyes
hes on the upper level of a two tier command center
a dozen aliens operate holo consoles
readying the ship to leave
ella settles down on a glowing docking collar
with the two ships connected the display flashes a departure alert
shes climbing back up the ladder he follows they quickly climb up the ladder tube engines are warming up got eight minutes til the ship leaves and about one til
automated retrieval autojamated what
as they spill into the loading bay a clang reverberates the airlock door at theirfeyt the first explosive bolt shoots off
ella jams her shotgun into a sheath on her back presses herself flat hug the wall
jake does that beside her as the next bolt pings out when they come at us aim for their heads
only way to kill em for sure
he looks at his bracelet adrenaline surging it activates ill aim just fine
the last bolt fires and the airlock door shoots off sonofabitch
the manipulator arms scoop up cocoons pulling them down the she jumps through the airlock jake has no time to think
and jumps after her landing beside ella
starts to pick himself up
but what he sees assaults his mind
we rise up up up ella and jake growing smaller in what we now reveal is a massive hangar where automated arms plant recent arrivals into a veritable forest of
people and animals
level after level thousands upon thousands of cocoons are suspended from branch like limbs
jake picks himself up looking around the massive hangar in awe
she pulls him into an alcove as a machine arm swings overhead flashing a wide conical laser that inventories cocoons like the machine in the underground cave
as they crouch we cant let that thing see us or theyll know were here
she turns hits buttons on a console a door slides up leading to a series of corridors
she starts to move thisll take us to the bridge but jake doesnt follow
stares at her slavers up there
i sure as hell hope not
then im not goin with you
and now she hardens you got any idea how big this ship is
no ray youll ever find him alone
be like findin a needle in a slam
jake interrupts her by aiming at the laser scanner and firing his blaster blowing it apart
the scanner eye crashes to the floor flaming
a klaxon rings
i aint gonna find him
hes gonna find me
thanks for the head start
she turns and runs
jake moves to that scanner eye on the floor walks right up to it and stares into the shattered iris alright you sonofabitch
come and get me
jakes face appears as a thermal heat source fritzing as he stares into the scanner
the slaver fills with rage
aliens begin grabbing weapons but the slaver shrieks for them to stop
we dont need to speak alien to understand hes mine
jake has moved out into the corridors blaster ready eyes darting suddenly wham a steel barricade slams down behind him
another in front wham
hes trapped shut off from the passageways
a long dark tunnel
a door at the far end hisses open the turbolift elevator
his call is bging answe okay
and starts walking to the elevator
as a scream takes us to handmade ladders are swung forward onto the fort as apaches try to scale the wall but are blown back by alien parapet sentries
on doc running triage on wounded warriors
i need more bandages now
you lint and splint that leg
were losing ranks
and then out of nowhere
the bang bang bang of pistols fills the air as dolarhyde rides in with jakes gang
a renewed surge of energy as cowboys join indians to fortify their ranks you came back
told you i take care of my kin
colorado knows thats as close to i love you as hell ever get
but the upswing is short lived as a speeder whizzes past dropping a metallic bundle
it splits open right in front of the forts steel gates pieces hydraulically assembling themselves in seconds becoming the motherfucking supergun of death
two lethal barrels spin to life firing strange steel ball bearings in every direction
claw hooks snap out of the balls embedding in soldiers
one lodges in a gang member beside doc he flails a red spring loaded pin depresses in the balls center ka boom
doc goes flying from the kickback landing near grey wolf fwwwwtwhck
another claw ball clamps into the apaches shoulder he shouts struggles to pull it out the red pin starts to depress poc lunges jams his finger retjff h the pin
and blasting cap
now hes stopped it from exploding but if he pulls his finger out
he dies too
doc and grey wolf lock eyes
their fates suddenly entwined as bars of light move rhythmically across jakes face burning with determination as he travels up in the turbolift
it slows to a stop
the door cycles open and
the strangest thing happens
desert sand billows in a gust of ventilated air
jake emerges blocking his eyes the sand swirls and eddies
visibility reduced to zero
as jake pushes through the air clears a little
his eyes widen
trying to make sense of what he sees remember all those buildings that were pulled up into the tornado when absolution was attacked
and that crater they found that used to be winfields landing
it s all he in a junkwle hangar
false front facades
debris piled on top of each other tilted and twisted at funhouse angles
and the desert sand that was sucked up along with it all
a glowing reactor casts hellish light on the dormant wreckage
weapon ready jake moves past part of a brothel
jutting fragments of a horse corral
a creaking saloon sign swings like a pendulum clanks eerily
a steam pipe explodes steam
jake whirls and like demons
fanning out taking positions as
the slaver steps out of the smoke squarely facing jake
aad h is holding ella hostage
wrist blaster pressed to her throat
jake and ella lock eyes
shes terrified but staying strong
his hand lingers at his hip blaster ready
drop the woman
we both know this aint about her
but the slaver only presses his blaster harder into ellas neck
and jake meets the look she says youre as bad as they come
jake curls back the fingers on both hands cracking knuckles well you ugly sonofabitch
they say the same about me
a pipe spews steam unnervingly loud
coulda had your boys kill me five times over instead you rolled out the red carpet
so lets get it over with
the slaver hisses angrily at the challenge
pushes ella roughly off to one of his gang who keeps a blaster pressed to her side
vow o right the a ter of the town junkpile
the slaver his hand at his side twitching
jake his hand is still
but jakes insanely fast as he drops to a knee and fires gunsmoke style blam slam
the slavers hit and ella wrenches her captors arm backward and he fires useless rounds into the air she takes a hit in the leg as jake shoots the captor
with a shot to the temple jake grabs and pulls ella to safety behind a shredded store front taking cover lasers punching through the building walls ella spots an alien lunging around a corner jake whirls slam
the creature flies off its feet
ella does and here come the rest of the aliens as jake guns the reactor is hit in the crossfire and the ship responds with a turbine howl
corpses litter the floor
all except for the slaver
a trail of fluorescent blood leads around the corner
jake whirls to ella her leg wounded you alright
in pain she snatches one of those smart discs off a dead alien reactors hit
if i dont get this ship on the ground soon were all dead
tries to stand winces get me over to that turbolift
he slings an arm around her shoulder and lifts her helping her to the elevator
put me inside
she sees his eyes go back to the slavers blood trail i can manage the rest without you
but with go do what you came up here to do
he looks at her
at the blood
at the unstable reactor
and jake lonergan makes a choice goddamnit
he gets into the elevator with her
she slams the control pad doors close they start rocketing upward
she half grins as her eyes hold on him
and within them
as the fort siege continues dolarhyde and colorado gallop back and forth between their men kathwam
an explosion throws them off their horses
colorado picks up his father and they start running low under stray beams of plasma fire reaching doc and grey wolf docs finger is still stuck in that alien grenade
clamped to the bleeding apaches shoulder the hell iz that
grey wolf moans in pain
doc shouts to dolar tell him to hold still
if i have this thing figured right long as t keep my finger under the red pin we wont blow up
whats he saying
he says were all gonna die
we need to pull it out of his shoulder
im not pullin anything
hes the damn doctor
more people are cut down by the alien grenade cannon the blowback nearly knocks the grenade out of does hand dolarhyde gets an idea
looks doc right in the eye alright listen you slide your finger from under that pin ill slip mine in and hold it in place
then you pull it out and ill throw it
doc nods fearfully
dolar carefully slips his finger under the pin as doc slips it out
now doc takes hold of the grenade itself nods ready to pull it out
grey wolf braces on three
everyone lurches from the tension interrupt tell your wife were clear
we had an arrangement
i left your saloon alone and she paid me off
reeling now really confused were broke
paid you off with what
she stole from the people in your morgue
gold teeth trinkets pocket watches it lands on doc thats why he fond the watch under their bed
i thought she was cheating
just robbin corpses
and then wait
you hate me
whyre you telling me this
with genuine remorse may not get another chance and i still hate ya
forgiveness and atonement
and doc rips the grenade from grey wolfs shoulder he howls clamps tearing out of his flesh
but they did it
as more explosions decimate men dolarhyde pulls the grenade out of docs hands still holding his finger under the firing pin dolarhyde looks at colorado tell your mother i love
with that he charges into the swirling chaos but boom
colorados forced back by an explosion through the debris he sees his father running toward
dolarhyde hurls the grenade boom
it detonates in a but his sacrifice m s the tide
the explosion blows the a cry of victory as the humans storm through
aliens hurtle back in disorder the small alien bridge crew scrambles to control the damaged ship
the whir of the lift arriving doors open and whoosh
the smart weapon blurs out of the elevator slicing half a dozen aliens in half circles back around to ella who skillfully catches it as she run limps from the
lift with jake laser fire ignites the bridge as he makes quick work of the rest and ella mans a console getting to work were going down fast
she calls up telemetry on a holo window earth terrain the battlefield
sets coordinates vectoring the ship that way a whir as a second turbolift arrives
and the slaver steps qqt
wounded and very pissed off
jake says to ella no matter what
jake and the slaver hurtle into each other tumble off a catwalk crashing into conduits and gunky water below
jake staggers up but the slaver is huge slams jake back into the water
pins a foot on his blaster arm crushing it
jake howls as the slaver presses a series of those hieroglyph markings on jakes bracelet the symbols light up in an unlock code and ka ching
the bracelet pops of
the slaver tosses it into the gunky water
draws his laser whip whup snap
the white hot tip lashes jakes back ripping his shirt and burn scarring his back
jake screams in agony as the slaver whips him mercilessly the scout ship screams down out of the cloud toward the canyon
outlaws and apaches finish off the wounded tomahawks ripping away tentacled scalps
carnage and joy but then a monstrous shadow spreads over the battlefield
everyone looks up to see the scout ship plummeting down fall back
another laser whip snap and jake seems done
now the slaver lifts jake from the water crushing his wind pipe
jake flails reaching for something below frame
finally grabs and stabs it into the slavers side
the alien roars in pain and looks down to see go to hell
jake drops gasping
painfully starts climbing a ladder back to the upper deck as the humans flee from the fort the remaining aliens retreat to the last shuttles for escape
start to lift off
but find themselves smashing into the enormous hull of the ship as it crashe down
jake falls into the seat beside ella straps in
fighting the controls she sees the whip marks on his back
it tears her heart open
and because this might be the end
she admits i lied
no i heard what you said when i was layin there
as she says you are a good man
the ground grows bigger out the window
her hand reaches over for his
jakes hand clasps hers and the frame is white with dust and sunshine
as from the ether comes
emmett happy and doc with grey wolfs arm slung over his shoulder
among other faces white and apache
all of them proud warriors
staring in awe at something starts to rain down
looks at first like glitter
until we realize its gold dust
from an opening in the scout ship the sound of thundering hooves as
all the animals stampede out
hundreds of people emerge dazed their minds slowly waking up
white and kiowa apache abductees
doc rushes in searching faces no no no n there she is his beloved maria stumbling weakly toward him as tears runs down her cheek
he embraces her madly kissing every inch of her face as
emmett pushes through the crowd sees sheriff taggart the kid grabs his father and holds him for dear life as taggart stares back in a daze its me its emmett
and somewhere in there recognition comes to the sheriffs eyes
emmett smiles and throws his arms around his father again as families lovers friends
moving through the fallen bodies toward the lifeless form of dolarhyde his father
eyes welling he drops to his knees
colorado turns its percy
like waking from a dream
sees his father on the ground
and all colorado can say is
that hangs there
and then whos gettin the ranch
at first words that dont compute
then pure blind rage takes hold and his fists fly punching percy colorado whirls dolarhyde is staggering to his feet alive
no ones gettin my ranch
stunned colorado grins
percy spits blood points accusingly paw he dolarhyde smacks percy across the face ow
whatd you do that for
for being an ungrateful little bastard
now shake your brothers hand and thank him for saving your ass cause its more than you ever woulda done bjm
chastened percy glowers at colorado
grudgingly reaches out a hand
so does nat
as they shake thats better
staggers through the crowd
and sees ella
thgy did it
but she still looks troubled
staring out at the vast desert
what is it
we didnt get all of em
some ran oft
that lands on jake as he too looks toward the endless horizon
hold on them together a victorious but unresolved note
we rise up over the sea of bodies and the crashed ship until jake and ella are just two small figures in the crowd
a glorious sight absolution in rebirth flush from all that gold
storefronts brightly painted the streets alive
we pick up emmett running through the hustle and bustle with two apache kids
suddenly dolarhyde colorado and their gang ride in
sheriff taggart emerges from his office with deputy wade what
whatd i dq
get outta the road before youre run down
if your overlapping momma saw y saw me playin in the street shed roll over in her grave and shoot lightnin bolts outta her eyes i know i know
he runs off
taggart smirks kids got a mouth on him
well kyle considering he saved your life guess youll just have to grinn bear it
dolar moves up to taggart tough as ever
the men hold looks woodrow
percy stews about something
dolar whacks him upside the head go on
grudgingly percy hands taggart a sheaf of paper whats this
claims to the land miles west of here
ive signed it over to the township of absolution
off taggarts look considering im a businessman i figure expansions in both our interests
needs the sheriffs signature to be official
fifty miles west of here is where the goldmine is woodrow
with surprise taggart studies the paper
smiles whats this about twenty percent going to the apaches
dolarhyde glances at colorado
but the hardened rancher maintains his rock solid facade figure the only way not to piss em off is to buy em
since whend you worry about pissin anyone off
just sign it goddamnit
with a grin taggart gestures for deputy wade to turn around and flattens the paper on his back using it as a surface to sign id say you were being
generous woodrow but i know youd just be insulted
dolar gives his hat a tip then mounts up to go and we rise up to the upper floor of the gold leaf saloon in the process of being rebuilt
in grand style and move in on a window where doc and maria burst through a door tearing passionately at each others clothes maria moans as doc kisses her neck shh
the workers will hear us
let them hear
as they tumble back onto the bed doc lurches
reaches under his back to find
a gold pocketwatch
what is this
look at the inscription
he flips it open to find an engraving mi corazon
doc looks up at her moved
then playfully this looks like aldo mayberrys watch
shut up and kiss me
she pulls him down out of frame a hand unties a horse from its tether bar its jake
saddle bags packed
a bark turns him around
yipping for jake to follow
as music begins to rise hopeful in a long shot the distant silhouettes of happy bounding through the shallow twin rivers jake following on horseback
as jake approaches apache sentries emerge from rocks to keep outsiders away
jake tips his hat and they nod let him pass
he nears the bluff where ella grey wolf and the rest of the apaches finish laying dynamite det cord that trails down into the canyon
ella hears happy barking turns to see her dog with jake
she smiles as he rides up dismounts second damn time that dog ran off on me
second time he brought me to you
happys tail wags
the look between jake and ella holds
and it seems freighted with everything
finally he breaks it glancing at the apaches finishing their work with the dynamite and the remnants of the alien ship and fortress below
looks like you got everything set
ella eyes jakes horse loaded with gear
looks up clearly where you headed
got some messes to clean up
but she looks at him
then off her look what
she walks right up to his horse
right up to him i think youre ridin off cause youre just scared of whatll happen if you stay
an inference here
ellas going bold
jake swings off his horse lands beside her
almost curious and whats gonna happen
she steps closer to him
intimate you know
a charge between them
all they wanna do is kiss
but thatd be too easy
and those wounds of his they havent quite healed
he drops his eyes softly now if i stay
its not gonna be good for anybody ella
she looks off
they say nothing
and now he slowly climbs back on his horse
ella toughens heard some rumors outta abilene
weird noises at night
figured id ride down there
give it a look see
his eyes narrow whats phenomena
big storms in places that dont get big storms
every fighting instinct in him suddenly ignited though he plays it down you goin down there yourself
you worried about me
you bet your ass he is
but he shakes his head no maam
you can take care of yourself just fine
then tips his hat be seein you around
he gets back on his horse
starts to ride off
happy barks and trots alongside him
bark bark bark
in dog that means dont be an idiot
jake glances over
get the hell away from me you damn mutt
go on get
he heels his horse leaving happy behind to whine
jake rides off into the sunset
but his hearts kicking in his chest
and this is pretty much where things usually end
jake pulls the reins as he sighs
turns the horse around
trots back to ella whose smile widens as he closes the gap between them
finally stops right in front of her
and despite his best effort to stay tough
he just plain likes her abilene happens to be on my way
he reaches out a hand
she takes it
as he pulls her up into the saddle
ella grinning ear to ear as she folds her arms around his waist
jake ever the outlaw grumbles stop smiling goddammit
he kicks the horse and happy follows
ella shoots a goodbye look to grey wolf who nods
signals his men and fuses are lit the dynamite fuses ssssssnake down the mountain reaching the canyon floor into those limestone tunnels where clusters of dynamite have been placed
and as fuse meets explosive angle jake and ella cresting a hill b mi the thunder of explosions makes them rear
they turn back to see
ella folds her arms tighter around jake her heart full
with a nod of private affirmation he spurs the horse with a hyai as the canyon behind them fills with rushing water jake and ella ride hard into the fiery
away from the past toward a future full of promise
