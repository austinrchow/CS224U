written by andy and larry wachowski april dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky
we hear wind as we sail like a glider over the black atmosphere
we dive down into the murkiness through the clouds into the darker world of the dead surface of earth the desert of the real
the rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere
we approach a fissure in the earths crust and as we do we hear the increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft engines
blue flashes grow in intensity from the fissure
radio voices indistinct at first grow louder as we approach the fissure
six oclock meters
we cant outrun em
cant tow this crate fast enough
we gotta ditch it
we hear the voices as though were listening to cops through a police scanner
the woman is niobe the captain of the lead ship sephora
cant the core is still good
and theyve got the one
oooh our savior
hed better be worth it
shut up and make the exit
the azure glow from the fissure is suddenly overwhelming
a tight convoy of three hovercraft explode from the fissure traveling nearly straight up like a trio of massive locomotives flying into the sky in tight formation linked together by
the blue glow has been emanating from the overworked flare drives of the first and third hovercrafts
between them suspended by tow cables is the dark scorched and sliced nebachanezzer
they rocket upward slowing as they reach the top of the arc
the rush to the ground pulling up at the last second
the neb flails wildly between them
theyre still on us
more vehicles fly from the fissure
a massive army of squiddies pours up onto the surface
the neb is slung between the two hovercraft with the cockpit facing backwards
trinity morpheus tank and neo the former thomas anderson crowd the cockpit
helpless the landscape speeds away from them while a wall of red eyed squiddies speeds to them
its been a mere two days since the realization of neos powers and the defeat of agent smith
the slipstream whistles violently into the interior of the ship and the crew is cold tired haggard and stressed beyond belief as they can only watch the action in their
knocked out ship
morpheus is on a headset
niobe theyre closing
just a few
maybe two or three
niobe as regal as she is beautiful sits at the controls of her ship with her co pilot a younger female
all visible dials are redlined as they streak over the dark surface
youve got a gift for understatement
the freedoms captain a silhouette in a dark cockpit is flying blind
his cockpit is awash in the blue flares from niobes ship
his lieutenant a shadowy female figure reaches for the radar screen
as she does we see her bare shoulder fall into view a white rabbit tattoo is conspicuous
they switch their screens to the radar squiddies right on their ass
oh shit were screwed
we gotta set down and emp em
a racing squiddies reaches the hull and latches on striking up its cutting laser and ripping into the hull
theyre on me
niobes lieutenant a muscular asian woman circa notes something on a console
multiple bogies closing
from the front
niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead
several objects are closing in fast
are they she doesnt have time to finish the question as the oncoming fighters launch a massive volley of missiles
from afar they look like dark irises surrounded by a corona of flame
at first we cant tell exactly what they are until their fiery trails rip straight at the sephora cockpit
circa ducks as the missiles harmlessly streak by
a massive swarm off missiles blasts by the cockpit
the individual warheads swerve at the last second blowing squiddies apart or casting them to the ground aflame
niobe breathes a sigh of relief
her lieutenant looks back up to see a wing of hover fighters defenders fly past their ship
sleek with huge blue flares from their engines theyre gunship fighters armed to the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage
hold on folks youre in for a little cleaning
the wing of defenders makes short work of the squiddies
the half dozen clinging to freedoms hull are picked off by well placed laser shots that turn the squiddies into curdling balls of slag
the squiddies that survive turn tail and run
the crew of the neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they leave the scene of aerial carnage behind them
neo has been gripping an oh shit handle on the edge of the cockpit
he relaxes his grip as their escape is clear
their ship suddenly enters a cave and starts to descend
the blue wash of the ship shows rock walls and pipes
the ships are slowing down as they descend back into the earth
tanks shoulders drop and he leans back into his chair
well not yet but were in the defense screen
a concentric ring of defenses that shields zion
the fighters that just saved us constitute the first ring
neb crew you can relax now
for the moment perhaps
its still a long drive home
and trinitys cabin
at first we see only stars twinkling faraway diamonds on a black velvet background
the camera descends through the darkness to a sunset dark blue as if just after sunset
the artwork terminates in the metal ring going around her room
its a much more hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft
the articles shes collected during her time in the resistance dot the cabin
an unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom
there are charcoal portraits of loved ones
softly lit the cabin sways slightly
the neb is still in tow
neo is sitting against the wall on trins bed with her curled up beside him with her head on his lap
neo cant sleep
he stares at the wall opposite him
theres a photo of the crew of the neb sans trin in better days
smiling laughing as they are seated around the table
morpeus tank dozer switch epoch mouse
neo stops on the image of a smiling cypher
theres an unknown asian man in the photo looking withdrawn and a bit lonely
gently placing trinitys head down neo stands and examines the photo
ill have to take that one down now
who is this guy
neo points to the mystery man
forgot his name
what happened to him
trinity is sullen
he didnt make it
neo returns to the bed and sits down disturbed
trinity sits up awakening
was he like me
not you though
there have been others neo
arent you tired
ive never been a big sleeper
i used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days
he turns to her questions in his eyes
how many ones have there been
thats not the point
neo may not think so
you are him
but what does it mean to be the one
i dont know neo
our mission was to find you
so now what
now zion will give us a new mission
the hatch swings open
morpheus peers in
were almost home
well need a detail
he closes the hatch and disappears
does he ever knock
not on his ship
the crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes to a rest
outside the sounds of hover engines fade away
tank unlocks the main hatch then jumps as it drops unpowered slamming into the tarmac with a resounding smash
the tarmac is a busy crowded military airport with hovercraft of different sizes spread across the lot
its housed poorly lit houses in a cave so huge the ceiling is out of site
crewpersons run around servicing battle damaged vehicles
munitions are carted across the tarmac on robot rolling racks
no one pays the neb and its battered crew any mind
nearby the sephora and freedom are parked
their engines shut down and their powered hatches are open
the crewmembers are spilling out
niobe hurries to morpheus side and he steps toward her smiling but their military manner is quickly restored though they can barely contain their grins
she shakes his hand the shake slows down
thanks for the rescue
they close for a kiss when the freedoms captain suddenly jumps between them
its choi the neos supposed neighbor and hacking financier
exhuberant and oblivious he joyfully gets in morpheus face
brough you us your asses
we saved you so hard core you dont even know
niobe smiles at morpheus and fades back as booth shouts his own praises
morpheus turns to his less mature peer
so you think you finally found the one huh
dujour chois lieutenant pushes into their conversation looking offscreen
idiot we helped him find him
he looks at what shes seeing
his gaze halts on neo
hes concentrating on tank and his apparent girlfriend who seems to be consoling him
he turns to see choi and dujour does a double take and his jaw drops open
choi is quick to resume his cool
in the flesh so to speak
welcome to the real world neo
im glad youre here
what do you think dujour
should we take him with us
morpheus turns from niobe and a zion officer
he addresses trinity glancing at the others
go on ships liberty
meet me in the dead duck at hours drunk or sober
its like a valley floor running between two gigantic walls of rock that are nearly vertical coming together in an elongated archway
carved into the street level are innumerable stores and shops above them apartments and balconies that rise to the top of the arch
people flow through the street
their clothes are homespun wool denim and leather
dyes and color are absent
carved into the solid granite walls between homes and around windows and doors are intricate and beautiful carvings
neo is lead down the street by choi dujour and trinity and a few other rebels
the push through a mult culti crowd of people humanity melting into one race
this is home
this is the main street
one of em anyway
almost everyone is a fighter
sometimes even the kids
they pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small machines
our energy as a people is directed toward liberation
check it out here are some newcomers
a group of frail buzz cut androgonites pass by them
they look at neo recognizing him as one of them a new comer
where did they come from
energy plant we raided on our last mission
there were some survivors
how are their minds freed from the matrix
if at all
they step into a club dead duck
its a sailor joint
lots of wood beer on tap and rum
crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels greeting them as they eye neo
they take a booth in the corner
the waitress arrives
welcome home brothers and sisters
first day back
on the house then
make it eight
the waitress smirks and leaves
trinity turns to choi
choi lights up and takes a drag
sidewinder and left right
i cant believe cypher turned
he who loses faith
neo we monitored your fight
did you really gain enlightenment
all i know is i kicked smiths ass
fuckin finally jesus christ
its about time we iced that bastard
yeah we finally won against an agent
i guess n isnt a bed record huh
the drinks arrive
tall glasses of rum
choi holds his glass aloft
they raise their glasses to toast
live free or die
all save neo live free
they slam the rum back and slam empty glasses on the table
neo can barely manage to sip his
god how do you do that
youve never drank before
not for real
you want to know what being the one means
one drink and youre toast
neo you know what else youve never done
she glances at trinity who falls back against the seat turning to suppress a smile
choi cracks up
yeah youve never done it
and virtual doesnt count man doesnt fucking count
ill drink to that
this time neo follows the others and slams back the entire glass
he coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on
the lights are dim and only a few late night revelers stagger through the streets on their way back home
walking straight and calmly through the stragglers are morpheus and niobe
so how do you like having your own command
they stop before the entrance to the dead duck
you must be both mother and father to your crew
niobe nods and looks into the bar
inside the crews are raging drunk and loud
who will you be now
the mother or the father
morpheus peers in on the scene and grins
as long as they dont get out of line ill just be a brother
neo is out of it while the others are merely comfortably in the bag
hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet
so you went back in and you two pulled him out
trinity nods herself in disbelief
neo picks his head up off the table
kicked smiths ass
choi eyes morphes and niobe coming toward them
hey did you kick anybody elses ass neo
yeah i smacked him around too
morpheus arrives just in time to hear the last part
he stands and grins down at neo
so you can smack me around neo
morpheus taps him on the forehead
neo blinks and falls back into the booth
he stands before them
hes on bereavement leave with his mother
dozer was the second son shes lost in this war
his comments set a sober tone
the nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month
but thats not giving us a rest
let me guess
weve been ordered back out anyway
this is another special op
im in command niobe and trinity are team leaders
neo is our secret weapon
flash to neo passed out with his mouth open on the couch
we dont know exactly what hes capable of
he may be just tapping his potential or he may have already reached it
we are to learn from him as he does from us
why are we always getting screwed
not only do i have to go straight back into the shit but i lose my command too
youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best choi
yeah and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents to death
oh my god thats so funny
my point is dont we need some r and r
unwind a little
we lost two crew on the last one you lost like five right
im glad we found mr
invincible here but jesus
you dont have to go choi
hes got a point m
i have faith but why so quick
we have a chance here but the window of opportunity is brief
our ships say the matrix is already upgrading and re coding to block our entry
every fucking time we get another one this is what they do
he is the one
you havent lost the faith have you choi
choi grabs a half filled rum glass and swigs it down
well these are the times that try mens souls
heres to victory
the freedom hovers slowly silently like a submarine as it cruises through the murky depths
it suddenly comes to a quiet stop and descends
the engines fade out and the vessel rests darkened on the cave
a quartet of squiddies slips by
we follow as they worm their ways through the twisted passageway watching as they pass the bubble cockpit by mere feet
freeze on the cockpit
within the shadows we see morpheus and choi at the controls
they watch the squiddies fade into the distance
aye aye capitano
minimal cockpit displays turn on and the cabin remains dark
the ships operator a lean asian kid with a gaze like a laser scan sits behind neo whos sitting at the operators console with his hands on the abbreviated keyboard
trinity sits with them her feet up as she observes
neo stares at the screen
its a huge syllabus of matrix code characters
he struggles to learn the complex code
but reverse ka is point nine right
you catch on quick man
i know these symbols from the hacking trainer
but how come its so hard to find them on the keyboard
your brain knows what to do
but it has to associate characters with your body
its muscle memory neo
think of the space bar and your thumbs nail it
because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times
but think about reverse ka and your fingers dont hit automatically hit the reverse key and the ka key in one shot
where did these symbols come from anyway
most of it is from the old japanese
see the machines arent binary
no zero and one
theyre quantum based so instead of an open close base of zero or one open or closed they use all numbers between zero and one
all numbers between zero and one
that could be an infinite number of numbers
not could be it is
neo is astounded
how many calculations per second
how many cps
well thats kind of hard to estimate
put it this way picture all the particles in the known universe
not just atoms but sub atomic particles that compose atoms
at last count that was what a gazillion right
razor barely smiles at the joke
well its up there
in any case the number of calculations per second the matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of particles in the known universe
thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds within their pcs
thats why it looks like reality
they have the computing power to create entire worlds
so if we hack into the matrix why cant we just change the code while were at it
see its not that simple
the machines the programs that code create and maintain the matrix the agents they are code
there are different types of agents many work unseen with no interaction in the matrix
then there are the enforcers the ones we know all too well
well my point is the machines code and recode the matrix by pure will
interaction with the matrix the physical act of being there by default allows people to change their environment the matrix
they move objects make sound affect cause
reality is unalterable
but the fabric of reality in the matrix can be rewoven
some can reach beyond normal cause
their affects on the matrix are deeper than average
they have learned to change it according to their needs
but they dont have total control
thats why we need operators like razor here
but you you go further than any of us can
razor stands and taps neos skull
he stretches grabs a japanese style wooden sword and out of boredom starts performing slow precise kendo moves around the main deck as he talks
the equipment you carry up here
youre a freak
a good freak
youre neural kinetics blast past those of average humans
this combined with your ability to suspend disbelief allow you to change the reality of the matrix
how did i end up as
razor practices the same strike a few times
the machines create people through cloning since obviously no coppertops have physical sex
theoretically all clones in the matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones
they shouldnt be any different from normal homegrowns
ok so how do you explain me
not just you
we were all born inside
well what separates us from others
for the past years or so something has been happening to children in the matrix
theyve been mutating changing in ways the machines never predicted
some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength
others seem to have psychic powers
razor looks up to see morpheus hanging back as he listens
he comes forward
and others are able to change the reality of the matrix itself
he points to neo
discussing history are we
razor shakes his head
im trying to teach this fool some programming man
hes stuck in the th century
hes got no skills man
without us hes helpless
in the matrix without him were helpless
morpheus can you tell us what the mission is now
not until we reach broadcast depth
its slow going out there
i guess they know were coming back so theyre patrolling
we have time to rest and ready
trinity sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock
it looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world
all around her as far as the eye can see lie mountains
their snow capped peaks are pink in the sunset light
she looks into the sunset
heavy thoughts weigh on her mind
a hand appears on her shoulder
how he got on the finger of rock is anyones guess
trinity grins slightly and pulls on his arm
there is only enough room for one on the end of the rock so he sits down behind her
dont lose your balance
it doesnt matter if i do
so you can fly
do you think i can
i think you can do anything you want if you believe
i dont know
i dont know exactly what i can do
trinity half turns
will you teach me to fly
i dont know if i can
free your mind of doubt
neo stands and steps in front of trinity
hes on the very very edge of the rock
he extends his hand down to her
she grabs it and he hauls her up
her eyes dart to the ground thousands of feet below the finger
in this construct program the ground can kill
i wont let you fall
they look into each others eyes
despite the trauma theyve been through and not even truly knowing one another theres a connection
neo suddenly backs away
he walks on the air with perfect traction as though hes on an invisible plane of glass
he leaves trinity standing precariously on the edge wobbling a bit as she maintains balance against nerves
she breathes deep and looks back up at neo maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle
neo stands a few feet away from her completely at ease as the high altitude winds ruffle his hair
neo extends a hand to her
its not real trinity
youre not standing there
i can do it
you can too
with one last glance at the infinite drop she steadies herself and stares straight into his eyes
blue meet brown
breathless she steps straight out
she takes one step in the air
for a breathless second as she steps off the edge she is stable
when she takes her foot off the edge though she sways and her foot slips as though shes on a greasy surface bobbing up and down
she corrects herself tries another step sags further
she glances down then locks eyes with neo
then drops like an anvil
he dives down shooting like a missile
trinity is calm falling backwards watching neo come for her
the rocky ground looms behind her
she makes no effort to reach for neo as he draws close to her
he reaches for her with all his might
trinity makes no effort to save herself even as collision is seconds away
she stares at him intently
grab on to me
seeing she is doing nothing he goes beneath her and scoops her up superman style
he barely accomplishes this before he slows and settles onto the rocky ground
they are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains
what the hell were you doing
trinity smiles slightly
her madness has a purpose
showing you neo
showing me what
you nearly gave me a heart attack
i want you to know how much faith i have in you
and this requires acts of insanity
she looks him up and down
she moves intimately close
so you really are superman
only when im plugged in
trinity steps away
neo grabs her shoulder and turns her to him
he attempts a kiss but she turns her face letting it land on her cheek
trinity looks at him then up at the sky
its not you
just not here
neo doesnt understand
trinity rolls her eyes
theyre watching us you big dope
do you know how horny computer geeks get
choi razor dujour and circa are sitting around the operators console feet up eating
on the screens are patchy images of trinity and neo standing together in the glade
its like theyre watching a soap opera
trinity and neo are looking in their direction
on the interface chairs the bodies of trinity and neo lay supine
trinity grabs neo by the arm
she leads him into the shadows
the voyeuristic crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear off the screen and into the darkness
razor puts his hand on circas shoulder and sighs
circa calmly pats his hand and removes it holding it in front of him
im sure mary palmer will appreciate your mood more than i
in the blue twilight shade neo and trinity kiss tentatively slowly then quicker as they give in to their feelings for one another
we move around them slowly then pan into the shadows a natural fadeout
agents jones and brown sit across from each other a steel table between them
they stare at each other for what seems like a long time
there is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst neat stacks of file folders
our defeat is worrisome
as is the loss of our colleague
they are both seething with anger
agent jones grinds his molars
we cant defeat them
you saw what happened
we have a backup copy of agent smith
jones stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window
the city spreads before him
a backup is not good enough
we need to upgrade ourselves to meet the new threat
brown opens a large file folder
hes being rebuilt
but i have an alternate plan
why fight the humans when we can let them fight for us
the terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot
this was the cause of our defeat
anderson is not unique
over the decades many humans have developed
techniques for manipulating the matrix
techniques too primitive for us to understand
most never realize their potential but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are recorded here
angle on the book as brown flips through
street shots of people from all walks of life
young rebels corporate suits junkies housewives
jones turns on agent brown
do you have anyone in mind
angle on the book
it stops on a page dedicated to someone who looks like neo but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude
there are photos of him on a motorcycle with a blonde photos of him drinking with his gang friends
he exhibits the traits we saw in mr
anderson no longer exists
our enemy now is the one called
agent smith walks in grinning
there is a new swag to his walk and his hair is longer tied back
youve been recreated
smith flexes his arm examines his hands and feels his hair
and you have more hair
smith turns to him examines the photos on the table
they lock eyes
on the same wavelength they transfer knowledge without speaking
smith looks at the photo on the table
i know what youre thinking
what we need is our own neo
if its possible
ill make it possible
we zoom in on the grainy photo of neos doppledanger
quiet at first growing louder as it grows dark we here the rumble and roar of motorcycles
far off in the distance the glow of motorcycle headlights racing toward us
as we zoom out and focus in they are already too close to avoid
they rip by us thundering explosions and men and women cheering
the pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets
they fly down the highway using both lanes drinking and driving with total abandon
angle on the lead motorcycle a massive custom made harley
gregory lowfield thomas j
anderson without a desk job without cares revs his bike and locks the accelerator
he hands his beer to the blonde who rides behind him then in one swift motion jumps up on his seat leaning into the slipstream
the feat is impossible
his girlfriend chandra screams at him as she grasps the seat and lowers herself to the bike
greg are you fucking crazy
but dont worry
she clings to his legs as they barrel down the highway
they blast pass a darkened cruiser
the cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the pack exploding down the highway with gregory surfing his bike
angle on the radar gun
its flashing mph holy shit
drunk ass punks
gregory is facing us as he drops back into his seat taking his beer on cue from chandra
behind them the cops lights flare up
stop stop lets have some fun
we look through the windshield as the cop drives down the highway calling in his stop vehicle report
he suddenly sees something that makes him slam on the brakes
angle through the cops windshield
the ten bikers with gregory at their center are parked in the middle of the road looking at him casually
the cruiser comes to a stop mere inches from gregorys leg
the cop bursts out of the door
what the hell are you doing
well tell you when to stop little man
not the other way around
he dives back into his cruiser reaching for the radio
gregory pulls a huge silver
from his jacket and fires
the cruisers antenna is blown off at the base and the nine foot whip flips onto the ground with a metallic clang
the cop is lying half on the seat taking cover
the handset relays only static
he reaches for his gun but is frozen by gregorys voice
dont try anything stupid man
i gotta bead on your donut eating ass
the cop comes out with his hands up
whaddya want with me
i dont know
i just thought id find out what you wanted without you shooting at me
so what do you want
the cop is a tough one
far taller than gregory muscular and serious
youre all under arrest
the pack explodes with laughter
gregory walks up to the policeman and circles him keeping the gun pointed in the business direction
this is your lucky day officer
were gonna give you a night off
chandra walks up to him
seductively she hands him the bottle of hard liquour
when he pauses gregory places the gun against his temple
reluctantly the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol
gregory lowers the gun
he and chandra return to their motorcycle
you never even saw us man
keep the bottle
they start their bikes and are gone like ghosts into the shadows of the road
a campfire blazes only a few feet away from the high tide
a billion stars shine overhead as gregory and his biker gang including the cop sit or lie around the fire
a few people are still awake and one picks drunkenly at a guitar
gregory stands throws a blanket over his shoulder and scoops up chandra
they make their way into the dunes
gregory and chandra lie on the blanket staring at the sky
inexplicably gregroy holds a hand toward the sky
which one do you want
it doesnt matter
with his hand pointed lazily at the sky a single star starts glowing stronger and stronger
it vibrates then fades suddenly and comes loose from the sky and becomes a meteorite burning across the sky
chandra draws closer to him enraptured by his power
how do you do it gregory
i dont know
sometimes it feels like
im reaching beyond the world
his hand drops and his head turns
he sits up startled by something
what is it
gregory holds up a hand for her to be silent
they found us
cant you hear it
i dont hear anything
we can only rebel so long
we can only push until they will hit back
the men in black
cu on gregory
in the distance the faintest sound of a helicopter can be heard growing louder
get to the bikes
gregory bursts over the hill holding hands with chandra as they run
hes only had time to through on his boots and boxers and grab his
chandra is dressed only in her underwear and gregorys leather jacket
get on your bikes and fucking ride
his gang burst to their feet
they scramble through the dunes heading for their bikes
a helicopter seen only by its massively strong search lamp and the wind from its rotors blowing sand everywhere flies up and over the dunes buzzing the running pack blowing
some off their feet
gregory mounts his bike and chandra jumps on back
with a wave of his hand all the bikes his included drop into neutral and rev into start
their headlights blaze as the helicopter returns joined by another
suddenly automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters
a bullet trail stitches its way across a pair of bikers sending them to the ground as the helicopters fly overhead
gregory cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead
the pack splits up in two directions as the distant choppers circle back
gregory cuts the lights on his bike and follows the highway by starlight
tinny radio chatter fills the red lit cockpit over the steady hum of the engines
the nose of the chopper points to the ground as it focuses on gregory and chandra who are ripping down the highway
cu on the cockpit instruments centered on the airspeed indicator
the needle is pushing to the max going through knots
holy shit hes outrunning us
gregory is pasted down to the tank of his bike with chandra gripping him for her life
the slipstream pulls his lips open and tears streak from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear
the helicopters grow smaller behind them
they break chase
chandra looks back and sees the lights turn away
she screams over the wind and the roar
gregory is staring down a dark highway
cant see shit
he turns the headlights back on just in time to see a roadblock of heavy duty military trucks
in front of the trucks is a sandbag wall manned by soldiers
the trucks are flanked by police cars
and if one looks closely enough they can see a pair of agents standing to the side
the stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they run frantically to get out of the way of the bike pounds of metal flying at miles
gregory plows into the sandbag wall directly between two parked trucks
the wall parts in an explosion of sand and sandbags
theyre through but the bike scissors uncontrollably until it rolls and we drop into bullet time
as the bike goes over we watch from the side as gregory dismounts grabbing chandra as he steps over onto the safe side of the bike
a massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike
it tumbles like a bullet falling through syrup and gregory keeps walking over the rotating surface using the bike to protect him and chandra against the flesh ripping concrete
the bike is coming apart as its bashed against the concrete
pieces rise slowly into the air the front wheel the forks the mufflers and a million flakes of metal until the body bounces into the air carrying gregory and chandra
holding her to him shes barely conscious of the lightning fast crash gregory rides the flying body with one hand on the frame
it comes crashing down and back into real time
the bikes body streaks along the highway
the sparks fade as it slows and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them
they stop crouching atop the body with gregory crouching over chandra
the disembodied front wheel rolls past them
stunned not quite understanding how or what he just did he and chandra stand and start running
behind them is a blurry wall of red and blue lights
police sirens grow louder
they start running down the highway then gregory yanks chandra to a stop
split up into the desert go
cu on chandra
in bare feet she sprints for the side of the road
the highway is littered with pieces of the bike and she stomps on a twisted piece of metal that impales her bare foot
she falls to the asphalt with a scream
gregory turns and rushes back to her even as a police cruiser is bearing down on them its v roaring and the siren impossibly loud
gregory drops to her side only to look up into the blinding high beams
he drops over chandra ducks his head and extends his hand toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into bullet time
the cruiser runs into his hand and stops as though it hit a steel post
the hood crumples in the center pushing the grill in even as the front quarter panels of the unibody continue around gregory and the engine smashes in through the console
pushing the cops apart as the glass windshield explodes and their seats slide forward into the console smashing them like jelly
with his hand still on the grille chandra and gregory remain untouched even as the entire police cruiser rips around them
we drop back into real time and see the cruisers body rip over and around them
the grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission remain still against gregorys hand
the cruiser was gutted like a banana shot down the center from top to bottom
it speeds beyond them silent now flips and explodes
the engine block is suspended a few feet in the air
it drops to the ground with a thud
gregory and chandra get to their feet and run into the early morning desert
unbelievably the driver is still alive
the steering wheel is smashed deep into his mouth splitting his jaw open
wet broken chokes emanate from his blood filled mouth
his eyes flicker and just before they close forever his body is seized by pain as he morphs
the crumpled door is knocked out of the frame
we see a black loafer step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps out slowly
we rise up from the loafer
as the other cruisers catch up to the scene of the accident agent brown watches
he looks into the desert
a police lieutenant approaches brown
sir should we pursue
withdraw your men and pursue the others
we have our own plans for this one
the ship is quiet
razor sits at the operator console smashing the keyboard as he forces tetris pieces into place
choi is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop
he speaks into his headphones
ok try it here
razor halts his video game playing and flashes to a different screen
lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types then hits the enter key with a flourish
the screen flashes and the familiar scroll of the matrix cascades down the screens
tell me you got signal
no fucking shit i got signal
dude theyre changing it
choi is annoyed
are you using the right pulse wave
shut the fuck up and get back here
the matrix scroll pours down at a streaking pace
its almost impossible to make out the individual characters
choi comes up behind razor oh my god
what are they theyre changing the matrix
razor patches into morpheus cabin through the headset
its dark but quiet classical music can be heard
hes not in bed alone
niobes shaded form can be made out behind him
morpheus sounds awake but looks anything but
he grabs the buzzing handset only an arms length from him
sir you gotta get down here
morpheus starts dressing as he talks
he puts a reasurring hand on niobes shoulder
the matrix sir
the coding is going nuts
be right there
morpheus hangs up the phone and jumps into his boots
he turns to niobe as he works
it sounds bad
theyre readjusting quicker than we thought
niobe jumps up and dresses quickly
it appears that they are learning their lessons
niobe shakes her head
morpheus how much are you going to tell him
about his predecessors i suppose
niobe dressed nods
he is the niobe puts a finger to his lips
six came before him morpheus
morpheus shakes his head slowly
to me none came before him
the oracle told me i would find the one
it is prophecy
you havent seen what he can do
what if they toughen the matrix code like last time
there are lots of ifs
how about this one what if we lose faith in our cause
he disappears through the door leaving niobe standing in the dim light
morpheus leans over razor and choi
talk to me
not good boss i gotta compile a new descrambler
were at broadcast depth
we have to download our mission specs
move aside i have to log into the mainframe
morpheus takes over razors seat
the scrolling code disappears replaced by the small words zion
mnfr m logon
morpheus pushes the keyboard under the console so its hidden from view
he taps at the keyboard
hidden password appears on the screen in the form of xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
morpheus eyes open slightly when he reads the screen but he regains his composure quickly
razors mouth drops open and choi starts cracking up
its a joke right morpheus
is today april st niobe appears behind them
its not a joke
we have the one
we must do it now
but theyre altering the code already
i cant even read it yet
morpheus turns and faces them
we have our mission but its up to us to interperate how well do it
morpheus theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is in antarctica
well never cut through it all
you havent seen the one in action
razor looks dubious and turns to the screens
can you hack in
razor pounds the keys
the matrix disappears replaced by his program
getting you in is no problem
maintaining the input output and helping you is the problem
thats how they killed savior number four if i remember right
they cut the signal and trapped him in there
morpheus spins the chair then stops it
their faces are inches apart
we dont speak of the past
excuse me for dragging up painful memories sir
he turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding
hes standing at the edge of some equipment on the main deck
hes heard every word
he rounds the corner
the others catch sight of him
the same thought is on everyones mind how much had he heard
niobe wake the rest of the crew
razor whats the eta for getting us in there
razor shakes his head
just gimme an hour ill probably have caught up to them
morpheus walks up to neo
come with me
from far away we see gregory and chandra hiding under the only bit of shade available for miles a tiny outcropping of rock
we sail in and cut to a panning shot scanning over the harsh ground onto chandras feet clad in gregorys boots up her sun scorched and scratched legs
shes collapsed onto gregory
hes in equally bad shape
gregory leans with his back against the rock eyes opening and closing as he drifts in and out of sleep
he stars at the horizon and the mirages of water reflecting the jaundiced yellow sky
in the shimmering distance a man appears but gregorys lids shut and we see darkness
when he reopens them the figure is more clear
its a man dressed in a black suit
even in the distance we can recognize him
we want it to be him
gregory can barely come to his senses as the figure approaches
chandra doesnt even wake
we follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches gregory
it comes to a stop just in front of him
gregory is fully awake but he thinks hes dreaming
he reaches out and pokes the black clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat
he looks up but the glaring sun obscures the face
gregorys voice is raspy as he starts to speak
oh my god
ive been searching for you for a long time my friend
gregory lowers his head
we need you gregory
to save our world
gregorys face raises the man in black eclipses the sun with his head making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all too familiar face gregorys head drops back down
he strokes chandras hair
its too late
do you want to live
a better life for all
life for her
and for you a chance for revenge
gregory raises his head
agent smith grins
he turns away and the desert landscape before them turns into a soothing cool crystal forest lake
smith takes a step toward it then turns and extends his hand
gregory is mystified
speechless he drags himself to his feet hoisting chandra and steps toward the lake
this cant be real
he steps forward only to have the image recede
you this dont you
will you help us
cu smith extends his hand
gregory grasps it
he lets go and collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge
the desert is gone replaced by forest though still under the poisoned sky of the matrix
gregory laps the water up and pulls chandra in rubbing the water over her face
calmly agent smith stands on the lake shore
cu agent smith
the humans are reflected in his perfectly still glasses
chandra stirs and awakens though she doesnt seem to see smith
gregory revitalized looks around at the miracle and up at the mystery man
who the fuck are you
smith grins devilishly
whats more important is you
we need you gregory
he pulls chandra ashore and stands to look agent smith in the eyes
first you try to kill me
now you need me
two years ago gregory your parents were killed in a terrorist attack in the heart of the city
the words spark something nasty in gregory
the terrorists were led by a certain individual
i know who it was
we need you to kill him
gregory laughs he turns to chandra to check on her
shes passed out on the smooth grass
what a bunch of bullshit
the whole government cant kill him so how can i
no one in the government can do what you can
i believe we have a deal
gregory stands and puts his face next to smiths you know ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal
and this looks like a once in a lifetime opportunity
so fuck you
gregory looks him up and down
hes got a few inches and pounds on the smaller agent
what are you gonna do little man
you looking for a trip to the fucking hospital
fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic surgery you smith delivers a chest punch that sends gregory sailing back twenty feet
he tumbles to a stop coughs and stares in disbelief at smith standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away
he removes his glasses calmly
he was stunned but hes not out of the fight
not by a long shot
no man can beat me
bring it on pussy
pull back as he charges smith smith is ready to deflect the blow but gregory dodges and bowls him over barroom style
with smith pinned below him he slams his palm downward
smiths head dodges the blow that pummels the ground
gregory is screaming as he smashes downward with the palms of his heels
every blow misses the mark
mother fucker what the fu
smith bucks up throwing gregory into the air
he flips onto his back as gregory returns
the sheer force of his street forged roundhouses knock smith around as he blocks
growing irritated at the untrained attack smith turns a block into a palm heel that hits gregory in the forehead with the force of a cannon blast
momentarily stunned he steps back enough for smith to perform a roundhouse kick
its like a helicopter blade smashing into gregorys head and sending him to the ground in a heap
ready to change your mind
he cant respond very well
blood fills his mouth and his face is mashed
a huge welt grows under the loafer mark left by smith on the right side of his face
smith crouches down by gregory i can teach you to beat me you know
this interests gregory
help us and both you and her will be free afterward
gregory stares at the ground then gazes past smith at chandra
finally he starts to rise
smith offers a hand and gregory takes it
you know it dont you
that theres more to your world than what you can see what you can rationally explain
im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine
but first you need to learn to fight
smith puts his hand to his earpiece
gregorys eyes close and his body spasms
he falls to the ground breathless and when his eyes open he stares up at smith
what the he stares at his hands
he sits up and watches his hands amazed as he goes through a series of block punches
he stops and stares up at i know kung fu
morpheus and neo sit together
the cockpit lights are dimmed down only the emp pulse button glows
outside the ship in the dark mists of the underworld patches of eerie phosphorescent moss glow on the walls
occasionally a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship
the two of them watch the deadly outside world
were deep in their territory
i see that
morpheus stares out at the night deep in thought
he turns to neo
are you rested
you know now that you had predecessors
ive heard things
what types of things
that there were others like me who you thought were going to be special
but they ended up dead
morpheus nods slowly
there were others
and i didnt tell you right away
because you were not ready
does this anger you
i dont know yet
so much has happened so fast that i cant decide whether or not im angry or dissappointed or even if i should be
you shouldnt be neo
you are the key in the oracles prophecy
everything forseen to come to pass has except one thing
the destruction of the matrix
morpheus looks out into the darkness
your coming was heralded and it is my destiny to prepare the world for you and to baptize you by fire
but from here on out no one knows
can we ask the oracle
not in this life
neo is confused
no one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day cypher turned on us
neo is taken aback
but she must have known if they came to her
perhaps she did
neo shakes his head
i cant believe it
i dont know morpheus if im prepared for this war
im not a soldier
how how are we going to win
for decades we have fought force on force in the real world without a conclusion
now after nearly a century of war were at a standstill
the only way that we can see to win is by destroying their source of energy
we have to pull the plug on them
we must crash the matrix
morpheus grins slyly
remember when i told you that ill show you how deep the rabbit hole goes
i brought you deep yet i no longer know the way
no one does
with every second we sink deeper than before
you are our guiding light now
your powers exceed mine a millionfold
i have shown you the path to victory neo
lead us down it
morpheus neo trinity choi and niobe are on the chairs as theyre being jacked in by circa and razor
cut to razor jumps in the operators chair his hands blur over the touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the matrix
were going straight for the throat people
angle on razor and circa typing like made at their keyboards
razor hits the enter key
they look on transfixed with anticipation
the screaming matrix code grinds to a readable halt
the slap each others hands and continue hacking
we have the advantage of surprise
they wont expect us to return so soon
the five of them stand immobile around a ringing phone as their minds filter in to their body images
they are dressed practically in denim and leather like blue collar workers
their dress wouldnt attract the slightest bit of attention except for the padded coats and tote bags filled with firepower
keep your eyes out for changes theyre modifying things
dial for operator
morpheus holds his celly to his ear
and have a nice day
he drops the phone into his pocket
they turn to him
niobe youre the liasion to our operators
neo what do you have for a game plan
where is the mainframe
the metacortex building
neos jaw drops
what the fuck
thats where i worked
and what do you think you were doing there writing code for video games
you were working for the man
its true neo
metacortex employs humans to write code for the matrix
i thought i was working on a fucking database
they keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing
thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people
but that doesnt matter
how bout this
i just walk up to the metacortex building and blow it up
what by power of will
chois smile fades
he looks to the others
hes joking right
morpheus shakes his head
well fan out around the city keeping an eye out for you
if youre able to accomplish this mission well phase back into the ship
stay in contact
if you lose your cell contact an operator immediately
the five of them exit
they blend into the crowds on the street anonymous and quiet
morpheus looks back as neo taller than most heads down the street
niobe pauses next to him
what is it
morpheus shakes his head
whats going to happen
if this is it right now
i cant even imagine
he grins and starts to turn
as he does his profile matches the profile on a wanted poster stuck to the wall
its a dark grainy picture of him alongside photos of neo and trinity
morpheus glances at it and continues on
neo walks calmly observing the people that filter by
men women children all oblivious to their true nature
a dirty homeless whino nose explosion red with burst blood vessels is staggering along the edge of the crowd unseen and ignored
somehow he catches neos eye
spare a quarter buddy
neo shakes his head but still stares
angle on the homeless
he mutters something and reaches into his shopping cart to open a garbage bag
its filled with twenty dollar bills thousands of them
how bout a quarter mil
the homeless man is astounded
as he stands speechless neo fades back into the crowd
smith and gregory fight in the glade
smith is always one step ahead
he is a cruel sensei and doesnt pull punches
but with every blow gregory takes he rebounds and attacks again
finally just as he seems to be gaining on smith he takes a rapid fire series of blows and collapses to the ground breathless and beaten
smith circles him
pain is only weakness leaving your body
when you are sufficiently strong you will feel no pain
tell me about what is happening
whats wrong with the world
get up and fight
gregory gets to his feet and takes a stance
smith stares at him from a relaxed poise
he slaps at gregory who deflects the blow and takes a jab nearly hitting smith on the chin
the world is not for you
he slaps has it deflected dodges a blow
what do you mean
youre not human gregory
thats why you dont fit in
thats why you have certain powers
gregory takes a swipe
they engage then push off one another
what am i from planet krypton
but as humans continue to evolve some are developing capabilities beyond those of the average man
reality altering abilities
i have them
others in the agency have them
and you have them too
were all that stands between law and order and a terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called morpheus
they stop fighting for a moment
we need you to stop the terror
we need you to save our world
it sinks in
gregory is starting to believe
we need you because youre better than me
now push past your abilities
you can turn you imagination into reality
see your hands striking me see yourself overcoming me
smith comes at him and gregory responds
their fists and kicks are a fast then turn into a blur
gregory cant believe his own actions
smith misses a block and gregory blows him backward with a chest punch
smith recovering looks up
gregory looks around
chandra is gone
where is she
from behind his back he produces a baseball sized glass ball
he tosses it to gregory
gregory looks in the ball
its a window to an apartment overlooking the city
chandra is in bed waking up
she doesnt remember our encounter
the ball disappears
smith puts his hand to his earpiece
agent brown is staring down at the ground
across the street neo is walking toward his building
ill be there
execute the defense plan
smith turns to gregory
come with me
but only watch
youre not ready to engage in a fight with the enemy
because if you havent defeated me yet you wont defeat them
smith snaps his fingers
gregory finds himself alone on the top of the makarao hotel overlooking metacortex plaza
the metacortex building stands across the street
neo has been along this road a thousand times but in another lifetime
neo raises one hand palm pointed toward the building
cut to neos pov the building is a massive tower of glowing shimmering energy no more real than a three dimensional polygon
morpheus and niobe stand atop a building a few blocks away looking toward the metacortex building
angle on neo he fixes his gaze on the building then lowers his head and closes his eyes
the building tremors slightly like a heat mirage
slowly it starts moving downward
angle on the first level
the exterior glass disappears vaporizing in a million crystal shards that melt into the air exposing the hive of office cubicles and corridors within
the walls desks and cubicles vaporize leaving a few hundred people office workers security maintenance men standing with nothing between them
the massive load bearing members vaporize
cut to the bottom of the building
one can look straight through the entire building
we go through the empty building passing dazed people until we pass out the other side and come to neo
he looks up
the office building is supported by nothing
slowly it descends on the stunned people
they rush screaming some laughing in hysteria before the ceiling can come down on them
the last few flee just before the ceiling touches the ground
the second floor melts away just like the first
niobe and morpheus stare on in amazement as the building collapses floor by floor
hes doing it
i knew it
choi and trinity look up in the air at the roof of the metacortex building standing beyond a block of buildings
it sinks toward the ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner
it cant be this easy
its not over yet
not by a long shot
cu trinitys face
someone plants the barrel of a silver desert eagle against her temple
trinity whips her head backward as it fires
we drop into bullet time as the flame and concussion blossoms in front of her face ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward pulling a pair of mac uzis
from under her jacket
the mans voice belongs to agent brown choi turns pulling a short weapon from under his coat
its boxy with a short barrel the size of a soda can
he plants it in the small of browns back and pulls the trigger
a cone of fire burns straight through brown blowing steam flame smoke vertebrae and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach
cu on the weapon
it recoils on tension coils discharging a shell the size of a ounce soda can
what remains of brown flies forward
choi helps trinity up and the retreat into the building and take cover under a window
through the window we see military trucks filled with troops charging down the street toward the metacortex plaza
after the trucks come rumbling black painted m a abrams tanks
a black apache helicopter flies over the convoy
choi looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon
holy fucking shit
weve stirred up the hornets nest now
agent smith and jones stare down into the plaza
the building shakes slightly as it descends
from the three streets that enter the plaza military vehicles pour in
hundreds of troops discharge and form a l shaped circle around neo
tanks rumble in and the apaches whirl to a hover
panicking civilians rush out of the kill zone
neo stands calmly continuing his work
morpheus and niobe stare from the rooftop
the air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse
the sky flashes and massive streaks of lighting blast across it like cracks in reality
they line their weapons on neo
they are nervous this is impossible
whats going on
just keep him in your sites soldier
his eye is glued to the tank site and his trigger finger on the fire button
the green crosshairs sit on neos chest
his eyes open but the building continues to collapse
he stares up at a mirrored window and somehow straight into the eyes of open fire
a wall of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines
the tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on neo as we drop into bullet time
the bullets sizzle as tracers burn off their backs
the draw toward him like slugs
thousands of bullets fired at perpendicular angles close in on him
as they draw close to one another along almost perpendicular paths they tinkle and chime and bounce
the bullets come to a stop glowing as their tracers backs continue to burn
the world is in stop motion as the bullets stop turn degrees and suddenly accelerate back at their origins
faster and fast they fly until we drop back into real time
the skirmish line of troops is ripped apart by a hail of their own bullets
cu machine gunner
with an m saw he blazes away at neo only to be shredded by his own bullets
a private takes a shot at neo and a bullet slaps into his shoulder
realizing whats happening he drops his weapon
the soldiers are dropping like flies
the firing quickly subsides
neo stands alone in the center unharmed
he turns to the skirmish lines
the surviving soldiers drop their weapons and run
only a few officers ncos and soldiers too amazed to think of running remain
neo is targeted on an lcd screen
the missile drops from its release claws and ignites accelerating off screen
the missile flies horizontally over the plaza then pitches up and back down at neo
he looks at it and at the last second the nose goes back up
the missile swoops up over him leaving him in its exhaust smoke
the missile banks panning across the city until it locks onto the helicopter from which it originated
the missile bears down the chopper
hes too stunned to move
mouth agape he can only watch as its blown to fiery pieces and comes tumbling down landing on the street as soldiers and civilians flee
the gunner pulls the trigger
we drop into bullet time as a cone of fire bigger than the tank and the shape of a pine tree blows out of the barrel pushing the tank back
from the fire streaks a heat round white hot leaving a laser like tracer as it bears down on neo
the tracer stops in front of neo and out of the air the heat round appears
suspended in air it shakes with violence
it accelerates backwards flying straight back into the tank barrel
the gunner screams as the breech explodes blocking our view
the tanks explodes like a ton hand grenade plowing soldiers onto their faces consuming the unlucky ones close to it and throwing the ton turret straight up yards into the
it rotates aflame and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man
the explosion shakes the building
the scene below is a complete route
black smoke billows up from the flaming wrecks
the remaining tanks arent retreating the crews are piling out and running
the apache helicopters turn tail and run
the plan is not working
agent brown enters the room
what about your protege
hes not ready yet
ill deal with this myself
you cant beat him
ive been altered
agents brown and jones look at one another
he clenches his teeth as though hes girding himself for something
kill the others
ill take care of this
razor is at his operator chair surrounded by consoles
some of the matrix code screens are in blue others in red at least one in green
the code on the green screen starts pouring down at an incredible rate
he hits something on the keypad
morpheus answers his phone
theyre about to pull something
processing power is pouring into the agent programs and theyre locking onto your d grid displacements
send through ghosts to confuse their lock
the ghost program is loaded
we see d images of morpheus and the others flash across the screen
smith stands alone his comrades have disappeared
the glass before him shimmers
the mirrored glass of smiths office wavers then explodes towards us
smith jumps and we pan down to follow his descent
he smacks into the pavement on his feet in front of neo
smith stands facing neo about two fighting distances away
neos concentration is broken
the metacortex building comes to a shuddering halt
and you have a ponytail now
as we concentrate on neo and he concentrates on smith we can see more black suits marching up behind him
neo attacks smith
smith backs away slowly blocking against a losing battle and taking hits
meanwhile the men in black converge on neo
just as neo lands a smashing blow on smiths chin three voices at once shout neo turns and smith pushes him hard in the opposite direction to face three smiths
they attack at once one going low and hard with a knee breaking sweep kick the other punching neo in the face and the third breaking to the side and
putting his toe into neos stomach with a vicious side kick
they attack is in perfect synch eight arms and eight legs working like clockwork striking their target without getting in the way of each other
the attack slams neo back right into the first bloodied smith
neo slams into his shoving arms and stops as though he backed into a brick wall
agent smith grabs him and holds him in a full nelson exposing him to his three copies
the copies shift position and attack again
two stand together left shoulder to right and with their combined arms slam neo in the face then step apart as the third comes in
the third grabs the shoulders of the other two and flips walking his loafers up neos body and kicking him from below right up into the chin of his jaw
it snaps neos back with a spray of blood
morpheus and niobe stare on as the fight rages
morpheus grips the edge of the brick wall edge
the stone crumbles under the tension
we can only watch
the assault on neo continues
he struggles unable to concentrate long enough to find a way to fight back
razor bangs away at the keyboard
four fucking agents no wonder so much processing power is devoted to them
a bird flying by niobe and morpheus slows its flight slows its flapping and freezes
a pink lightning bolt freezes as it streaks across the sky sealing the worlds light in an a light rouge
near the plaza panicked civilians slow and fall to the ground as though theyre passing out
razor stares at the data pouring down the screens
no goddamned way
his headphone chimes
morpheus is on the phone what the hells going on
theyre putting all the coppertops to sleep
they froze the matrix
all processing power is being re diverted to the agent program
niobe stands at the edge of the building and points down
down on the ground below them theres a swarm of agent smiths the passed out people stand and one by one morph into agent smiths
it happens over and over until dozens then hundreds are marching on the plaza
neo reaches back and puts his hands on either side of smiths head
as hes being pummeled from the front he squeezes and screams
his screams are mixed with smiths
the agents head deforms as were hear a sickening crack
suddenly the body reverts back to that of the original owner a security guard and the head simply explodes
the hold broken neo stumbles back over the body with the three smiths in pursuit
he somersaults comes up on his feet and jumps to the left putting one smith in front of the other two
he attacks his killing blows destroying smith smashing through his blocks
he falls and neo takes on the other two giving a kick jump that knocks both of them away in one shot
as he comes down a wall of smiths converges from all sides
they stop leaving a circle around him
we pan back to view a sea of black suited smiths flooding the plaza
as his hand passes over his face it is refreshed anew perfect again
he surveys the wall to wall smiths
smith talks with his voice times a thousand
neo leave the matrix
you know not what youre doing
well is that right
he turns to the metacortex building
its repairing growing steel girders and concrete skin
neos face darkens
reality shimmers as his anger strikes out at the building
the tops floors burn and then explode
the explosion rips down the building slowing slowing then stopping
thousands of smiths are gazing up at the building concentrating on combating neos attack
gregory sees the building exploding and runs
he smashes through an access door
gregory hurtles down the stairs one at a time
the building is frozen mid explosion
tons of pieces hanging in the air suspended only by frozen tendrils of fire and arms of smoke and debris
the smiths attack neo
they fight in a massive melee dying in mass
meanwhile the metacortex building pulls back together the damage and flame disappearing as time space around it is reversed
with his hand on his ear piece he comes out the elevator door slowly
pistol drawn he looks around the corner
morpheus and niobe stand there their backs to him
without hesitating he advances on them blasting away with impunity
the bodies of morpheus and niobe are wracked by gunfire and collapse in a heap of bullet ravaged flesh
brown walks up to the corpses and kicks one with his shoe
it shimmers and then disappears followed by the other
razor dials the phone
morpheus picks up
theyre hitting your ghosts
massive attack of static bursts on the line
what the the line goes dead
morpheus looks at the phone and redials
razor comes through his voice digitized and distorted
theyre cutting comes get to the access point on laxe the line goes dead
morpheus signals to niobe
they exit the roof as he dials trinity choi and trinity hide in the shadows of an empty room watching the battle
trinitys cell rings
she answers silently
what about neo
we can do nothing to help him
well only get in his way
they leave the room
gregory stumbles into the lobby
slumbering bodies lie everywhere slumped over desks half in chairs on the ground
he exits into the street
the scene is one from hell
under the neon sky fires are frozen and smoke columns hang in the air still like massive tree trunks
the battle rages and surges a thousand smiths pouring onto one neo
all around nearly covering the ground are corpses destroyed bodies abandoned by the agent
men and women of all ages and designs smashed decapitated and broken
the smiths overwhelm him with sheer numbers
neo is a blur a human chainsaw now crushing or smashing them all but they crowd on all sides
the bodies pile up as they fall and neo finds himself stepping up the rubbery mass of corpses
a few more smashed smiths fall morph back into their stolen forms and neo is knee deep in the dead
he cant take it
choking neo struggles to free himself
smiths climb up the corpse pile and drop onto him pounding viciously
neo stalls in shock his eyes locked with the lifeless blue eyes of a woman he just killed
she looks amazingly like trinity
perhaps for the first time he is confronted with the consequences of this war and his mind seizes as the smiths pummel him
neo goes berzerk
screaming and fighting he claws his way out and surges into the wall of agents
they throw him back and he cant kill them fast enough
he leaps upward trying to fly away but smiths cling on to him and cling on to each other
neo struggles to fly and as he does hes pulling a stalagtite of black suits clinging like iron filings on a magnet
his face is wide with fear and shock
he cant climb anymore and looks back down at the mountain of agents hes pulling into the air
his face clenches shut as a scream wells from deep within him
he starts to glow and we jump back to see a massive orange spherical shock wave blasts away from his body
it rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward even as it blasts the smiths away leaving him clean
everything slows down as neo exhausted tumbles out of the sky
on his way down through the neon light he passes bodies flying upward from the concussion
neo hits the ground bounces and lies still sprawled as people drop all around him piling up like satans snowfall
the sky and matrix are still frozen
trinity and choi make their way along cautiously leapfrogging from cover to cover
they pause behind a dumpster and just before looking out theres the sound of metal tapping metal twice
trinity looks in the direction of the sound
morpheus and niobe are standing still in the shadows near the end of the alley
trinity and choi make their way to them
trinity peeks cautiously around the edge
on the other side of the street is a phone booth
is it clear
i smell an ambush
choi grips his gun and grimaces
the world is frozen
ill go first
no one likes the idea
real time suddenly returns
the lightning bolts in the sky suddenly re animate thundering out of existence making the four of them jump out of their skulls
the sounds of the city suddenly flood back
on the street people stir to their feet
everyone is confused as to what happened
its a sea of the dead
from its center neo emerges soaked in blood gagging and gasping for breath
he stumbles over them
shocked and crazed he glimpses the metacortex building
its in one piece again unharmed
he falls against a smashed corporate art sculpture
he picks a cell phone up from the ground and dials
morpheus pick up
we hear nothing but static
disgusted neo throws the phone away
he falls against the sculpture and looks up
coming around the corner of the building is a group of agents and soldiers
neo sinks down staring at his hands
he catches his breath and concentrates
the blood disappears and he dons the suit of an anonymous soldier in black
his face too seems to change
he stands and walks away
we only see his back
they weigh their options
finally morphues gives the nod to choi
choi checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat
there are lots of people on the streets now
everyones in shock over what happened and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city
and remember kids when youre in a war never volunteer yourself
he walks out onto the street eyeing the phone booth and everything else
a gorgeous asian businesswoman stumbles into him
recognition lights up her face and she stops him
oh my god i havent seen you for months
choi keeps looking around making his way to the booth
oh yeah sorry about that
she turns angry
sorry about that
what kind of an asshole are you
trinity is looking around the corner
she pulls back into the alley
casanova just ran into an old flame
fuck you choi you just think you can come and go when you please
choi is ignoring her now walking straight for the phone booth as she is having a fit
tears are welling in her enraged face
choi if you have one shred of decency if you even care about me inexplicably choi hangs his trench coat on the side of the booth
standing behind it he reaches around with his arm keeping the coat between his body and the phone
the woman doesnt even notice the web of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering the inside of the jacket
youll tell me why you dont call why you you what are you doing
the jacket stops fragmentation
sometimes they bomb the phones
kiss me for luck
he grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers
his hand grabs the phone
we hear the dialtone and he mashes down one of the numbers of the keypad
the number tone rises in pitch to a crescendo
we pull back and the booth explodes
choi and the woman are bowled over by the flame
they take cover from the blast as people all over the street are knocked flat
the phone booth is obliterated
miraculously choi and the woman are still under the cover of the jacket
throwing the smoking jacket off them choi screams in agony as he grasps the smoldering stump of his right shoulder
the arm is history
the woman looks on her eyes as wide as dinner plates
shaking she falls back still staring
you werent lucky
morpheus niobe and trinity rush to him picking him up on his feet
choi is screaming and laughing
someone grabs his smoldering coat dragging it along
choi stares at the ex flame as they cart him away
his eyes are crazy
you still want me to call you
ha ha ha
as they struggle down the street choi starts to walk more on his own
people run from the scene screaming
cu the four of them
morphues looks at something off screen and frowns
he pulls to the left
tanks and troops are filling into the street ahead of them coming from around the corner
they turn onto a different street
this street too is filling with troops
worse its being lead by agent brown
tanks or agents
yeah tanks a lot
choi stands on his own and they run back onto the street with the tanks
three abrams stop in the street
their turrets swing into place with terrifying quickness and precision
at once they open fire with their main cannons and machines guns
fire flowers blaze from the death machines sending a typhoon of lead down the street
troops filed between the tanks pull their triggers and dont let go
everything in the street is shredded and blown away as though it was hit by a high power pressure hose
with unearthly speed everyone breaks for the sides of the street except for choi
he stands amid it all as the tracers come closer to his body
he raises his machine gun with his good arm and lays into the enemy
tracer rounds kick away from his gun ripping straight back into the wall of soldiers
his rounds deflect off the sloped armor of the tanks recoils pile into the flesh of troops
he rakes his fire into the enemy bodies
tracers zoom in on him
a tank round blasts by and the wall of air kicks him to his side
he continues to fire even as a bullet followed by another blasts through the middle of his body
more and more bullets smack into him blasting chunks of meat and viscera out the back
trinity and niobe take one side of the street running and shooting simultaneously
they reach the buildings on the side and niobe goes straight up the facade of the building as trinity jumps from cover to cover cart wheeling through tracer fire and
on the other side of the street morpheus goes straight up the building facade and starts running sideways completely defying gravity firing downward at the soldiers
he will not fall and a hose of lead drills into him taking his body apart piece by piece
bullets take away pieces of his head neck and torso and in one final wave of fire he is disintegrated leaving his machine gun barrel smoking spinning in the air
the arm is still attached and finger clenching on the trigger
it is the last piece of choi to fall
morpheus climbs as he runs
in mid stride he changes magazines and stops standing on the wall his body parallel to the ground
on the other side of the street niobe stands on the wall blazing at the mass of troops with two guns that never cease
there is no cover and no reprieve from the double death from above
most are still firing down the street or over toward trinity
trinity runs up the side of the street
her guns go empty and she dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her
in slow motion he pulls a spoon from a grenade
somehow the metal ring reaches trinitys ears
she slaps a magazine into her pistol pulls the action and comes out from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade
she fires hitting the grenade
it explodes directly over the group of soldiers flattening them to the ground
a bullet smacks through trinitys wrist and the hand comes off popping like the head off a dandelion
blood spurts from the severed arteries spraying the hand with the pistol still in its grip
above the street morpheu and niobe leap for one another
they catch each others arms fifty feet above the surviving enemy and spin in place firing away
the tank commanders in their copulas blast upward with their machine guns but the rounds miss the spinning couple
morphues and niobe concentrate on the commanders and cut them down
they land amidst the carnage
trinity emerges shaken pressing her coat to her arm
the other end of the street fills with soldiers and agent brown
he surveys the scene and immediately draws and fires running full bore for the rebels
morpheus niobe and trinity are too close to the tanks to be fired on but the nearest one lunges at them
they climb up over concrete stoops and over the side of the tank
they sprint down the street as the tanks turn their turrets behind them searching
the garage hurry
they dive behind a corner as a tank fires
morpheus throws the woman forward as the tank round hits the edge of the building blowing the concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder
perhaps a ton of rubble falls on morpheus legs
he drags himself forward
niobe and trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble
niobe shoots the lock off a steel door and they pile into the building
agent brown and his men rush into position around the building the rebels are hiding in
suddenly an unimaginably powerful engine starts and as we stare at the garage door it explodes outward
a jet black hyped countach explodes out onto the street tires literally on fire as they throw up smoke
it cuts through a few soldiers hitting them in the knees as it rips up the street the throttle going way too high
the street scene spins before them
trinity is at the wheel a broken and dusty morpheus sitting next to her
the tach is redlining as the car rips up the street
pedestrians dive for cover
trinity holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one handed
morpheus does so and the tires squeal again when she releases into second then third
in a few seconds theyre over on the busy street
soldiers pick themselves up just in time to hear another engine a super powerful track bike emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen
a wheely bar on the back of the bike keeps it from flipping around the rear tire as it accelerates like a bullet out of a barrel
there isnt even time to take a shot until shes gone
they rocket up the entry to a highway ripping past cars by driving up the breakdown lane
once they hit a straightaway trinity floors it and the speedo creeps up past as they dodge in and out of cars
morpheus grabs his twisted folded legs
he was literally poured into the seat
concentrating his face knotting in pain he straightens the broken fractured legs
he closes his eyes and concentrates
the legs reform into straight strong limbs
morpheus grabs the wheel
keep your foot on the gas
trinity pulls her bleeding wound from her arm
her face tightens and she closes her eyes fervently concentrating shutting the world out which is good as they suffer constant close calls as morpheus controls the wheel from his
when she opens her eyes again she grabs the wheel
with both hands
morpheus pulls out his cell and tries the line
its still full of static
theyve killed city wide comms
then the agents are out of touch with each other
they cant track us but that gives them more time to destroy our exits and find the neb
well try the desert
communications might be working there still
what about niobe
she knows to meet us there
niobes bike sizzles down the highway insanely lane splitting at over miles per hour
the wheely bar is folded up against the rear wheel
a dual stream of vehicles spit by her like giant machine gun bullets
she zooms out of view
gregory slows from a run
he looks back as police cars and ambulances race toward the metacortex building
he cant shake what hes just witnessed
he looks forward only to run into gregory freezes then bursts into questions
what the fuck just happened
we need you gregory
will you help us stop this
gregory is perplexed
resolve comes over his face
i can stop this
but how can i fight him
i will give you the power you need
the building is old crumbling and inside painted a horrid green that no sane person could find attractive
the humble place is home to the neo exits an elevator
recomposed and dressed normally he walks up and down the hall trying to remember which apartment she lived in
a tall black woman one of the oracles priestesses comes out of the stairwell and recognizes neo
he turns and looks at her
she smiles but as neo looks at her a flash of uncertainty and maybe hate flies across her face before the smile returns
the oracle is anxious to see you
neo follows her into the familiar apartment
the windows are covered and neo and the priestess are the only ones there
the priestess moves into the dark kitchen
neos eyes adjust to the darkness
he hears something squish as he steps and looks down
the tattered rug is a swamp of dark congealing liquid
neo reaches down and touches it with his fingertips
its half dried blood
he stands his eyes adjusted to the dark now
the walls are chipped covered in bullet holes
in slow motion the entry door to the apartment opens
in walks agent brown
neo turns to the kitchen
agents smith and jones appear
they all draw their
neo stands still as they walk up to him and put their guns to his head
agent smith scoffs
i was on to you the whole time
i only came in here to isolate you to destroy you
what are you waiting for
i realized that i cant destroy you he nods at smith without destroying the matrix itself
you killed me too easy last time
and if you kill us he nods at jones well only come back like him
brown nods to smith
smith breathes deep and drops his gun
the others follow suit
so why dont you take it all down
but if i destroy the matrix everyone within it will die
i take it the great morpheus failed to mention this
neo looks up at him but his expression doesnt change
how many people are in it
smith holsters his weapon
he speaks matter of factly
six and a half billion
for neo the numbers are too huge to imagine
could you destroy us
its a serious question for neo
but he nods
he knows his potential
what does that make you feel like
he is amused by the idea
this is getting tiresome
where do we go from here
if you cut the power that the matrix supplies to your armies ill let you live
we dont care about life we care about victory
so our kind
you mean lives
who do you think started this war boy
your kind tried to kill us first
but you didnt
youre not as tough as you think
the three agents helpless to stop him watch as he walks for the door of the apartment
neo opens it and stops his face meeting a flying fist
his vision flashes with the impact and he staggers back into the room falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet
gregor steps into the room tall and bad
neo holds up a hand
i dont want to fight you
gregory doesnt answer
he smashes a side kick into neos gut doubling him over
the kick carries such an impact that a pale concussion wave flashes past gregor
it sends neo crashing out the window
gregory stands upright and moves to the window followed by the three agents
theres nothing on the street twenty stories below
the building starts trembling
we hear rapid fire impacts growing louder and coming faster
the floor explodes as neo crashes up through the concrete throwing the agents away as he embraces gregory in a bear hug
they blast up through the ceiling
we follow them up through three more floors bam bam bam
each concrete floor smashes gregory in the head
neo and gregory smash through the roof flying upward like a missile past us
his face is contorted in rage as he rockets upward
gregory is barely conscious
seeing this neo stops and flings gregorys body violently earthward
neo looks down as the body falls toward the city thousands of feet below
he turns away just as the distant gregory is falling out of sight
just before he does the speck of a person pulls up and grows larger and larger as it returns
a contrail streaks behind him as a rips through the air
fists forward gregory is like an mx missile bearing on neo
neo turns just in time to catch both fists in his chest
like a cue ball striking another billiard all gregors momentum is transferred into neo
gregor stops dead in the air as neo is hurtled out of view
he is in shock somehow as he sees neo flying away
he clenches his fists and flexes his body then looks down
we see the ground thousands of feet below
for some reason he starts to fall
even as he claws to maintain altitude his rational mind has caught up with him and is somehow denying the fact that he can fly
as hes facing the ground neo slams into him from above
gripping gregor by the neck and his belt he drives straight down
the ground rushes it takes one second to drop past a story skyscraper
neo slams gregor front first into the concrete sidewalk
they bust through the sidewalk into the sewer below
offscreen we can here choking breaths
neo looks down
gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab impaled multiple times through the chest by snapped rusty rebar
he takes one last breath and his eyes half close
neo checks the pulse
finding nothing he leaps out of the hole
his eyes blink and he follows neos departure
choking unable to breath with the rebar through him he writhes
theres nothing for him to grab to pull himself off the steel
his eyes clenched shut gregor levitates by force of will pulling his body off the rebar
the corrugated bars make wet sucking sounds as the pull through his body
finally he gets to a twisted piece of bar and cant make it over
hes losing all his breath all his life force over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest
with one last wiggling effort he works it through him
his mouth opens wide but no sounds emit lest he recall neo
just as the end of the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more the countach and bike zip down a long perfectly flat empty road
a brown sunset plagues the horizon
there is no civilization in sight
morpheus tries his cell again
this time it reaches the neb
razor and circa are both operating the consoles
good to hear youre still there
jesus you too
where the fuck are you
about two hundred miles east of the city on highway
we need an exit
coming up on your left ten miles a rest stop
i dont remember an exit there
gimme five minutes
razor clears the screen in front of him and cracks his fingers
he looks at circa
gotta get em out
they need an exit program
razors fingers fly at inhuman speeds over the keys
data pours down the console as he blazes away
finally he hits enter so hard it rocks the station
razor turns to circa as matrix code resumes its cascade down the screens
did you like that
circa just rolls her eyes
morpheus phone rings
exit ready sir
check the phone for bombs
circa looks over some data and shakes her head
its all set
theres a pair of cops at the rest stop though
not a problem
the countach pulls into the meager rest stop not more than a water fountain toilet house and phone booth
a police cruiser sits lights off waiting to intercept speeders
the countach skids to a stop kicking up a massive dust cloud that hides the car
we hear the door slide and the massive black clad figure of morpheus emerges from the dust
an uzi in each hand pointed at us
the cop behind the wheel is too slow to draw call for backup or even duck for cover
the safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips through it chewing the cop to pieces
his body thrashes in the seat
morpheus turns away
niobe pulls up on her bike and gets off slowly obviously the ride had been a long one
trinity joins them
i thought razor said their were two cops
a rookie cop his face to young for a razor is shaking as he peeks through a crack in the door through which he sees the terrorists who just wasted
he finishes buckling his pants and draws his service pistol only to shake in pain as his body morphs
razor and circa see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen
fuck fuck fuck
they smell somethings wrong
they move back to back in a triangle for the phone booth weapons draw and looking in all direction at once
niobe you first
bullshit its my turn
junior ranks leave first
trinity enters the booth as the phone starts ringing
its the moment smith was waiting for
he bursts out of the door gun firing at the booth
inside glass shatters and blood sprays as trinity is riddled with bullets
smith doesnt stop
he sprays for an eternity even firing as she collapses phone still ringing
her body slumps smearing blood against the booth door as it shuts from her weight
trinitys body spasms violently against her harness as her life signs go berserk
shes not dead but death is only seconds away
circa screams but razor is locked staring at the screen with the intensity from which he derived his name
morpheus and niobe open fire
smith shudders flickers violently his body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at him
the actions of the guns stop in the open position barrels and empty chambers smoking as the last empty shells patter to the ground
morpheus throws the guns down and turns to niobe
get her out
niobe dives for the shattered booth kicking away the starred glass and answering the ringing phone
she pulls it down and hauls trinitys destroyed body up placing the phone to her ear
trinitys head merely sags lifelessly to one side
go through trinity
god damnit dont give up
trinitys eyes flicker
she focuses on niobe summoning her consciousness enough to make the phase back into the real world
she starts to fade as we cut to circa stands over trinity as the rebels blue eyes flutter open
her whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs circa
youre safe youre safe
morpheus charges smith
smith ignores reloads him and sights in on the exposed back of niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone back on the hook
as the sights rest right between her shoulder blades morpheus grabs his gun with both hands
he squeezes off one shot the action freeze back on an empty chamber before morpheus throws his hands up in the air the shot ricochets clips niobes ear and ricochets
off the booth
she hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear
the phone rings
she looks at it then back at morpheus and smith raising dust as they fight
she leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight
razor pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen
circa has removed trinitys interface but shes having a seizure
circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the cover off a wicked hypo
whats wrong with her
her bodys dying but her mind wont quit
circa straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest
morpheus and smith clash in the dust punches kicks and blocks coming too fast to see
smith is wailing on morpheus but morpheus sneaks in a kick that separates them
they take stances a good two distances away
theyre about to go at it again when niobe sprints into the fight
performing a flying leap kick smith grabs her and swings her down crashing her body into the concrete with a sickening crack thud
she rolls fighting the pain as morpheus flies back into action catching the agent with a furious ass of swinging kicks
niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love
together they assault the agent their speed almost almost equaling his their will capped by the limits of their matrix bending powers
finally smith resurges
he lands a punch into niobes stomach and her body folds over unnaturally as if her back is broken
she crumples to the deck blood pouring from her mouth
morpheus screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of smiths neck smashing the agents face down and imprinting it in the concrete
for a moment smith is still
morpheus collects niobe and runs for the phone booth which is still ringing
its too far
smith grabs him around the knees spilling him forward
man handling him like he weighs nothing smith gets on top of him and starts smashing his fists down into morpheus face
i should have killed you the first chance i had
like an enraged silverback he raises his fists together for one final blow
but instead of striking his eyes catch something
he flips back jumping as a silver streak cuts through the air a split second too slow to cut the agents head off
instead it slices cleanly through the triceps of the raised arms leaving nick on the throat
razor dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas steps over morpheus as he pursues the agent
smith rolls backwards gains his footing and retreats from the swirling blades of death
he turns to morpheus go
razor is strapped into one of the interface chairs his eyes closed
half dead morpheus drags niobe to the booth
behind them agent smith backs away from razors dual blades on long one short
whenever razor attacks smith backs away
they circle one another
morpheus puts niobe through the phone
razor forces smith around
come on tough guy come got some razor
smith frowns and moves forward but the whistling edge of a blade makes him think twice
razor holds the short sword parallel to the ground the long sword straight up
he hides his eyes behind the short sword
smiths back is against the sunset
the sun drops below a cloud
razor flashes the light off his short blade directly into smiths eyes blinding him as he strikes with the long sword
smith blinded turns and backs away
in the booth niobe is gone
morpheus hangs up the phone
he can barely stand up enough to reach the handset
when it rings he picks it up
but he doesnt disappear
she punches some keys
morpheus d avatar flashes on a console along with a massive array of weapons
morpheus disappears for a second then reappears
now he is perfectly clean and immaculately dressed
he replaces his sunglasses and kicks through the remains of the booth walking toward the fight as he produces new weapons heavy with ammo from his long coat
razor keeps swinging at smith and missing
seeing his chance he runs back for the ringing phone
smith pursues almost on razor when the neo samurai jumps in the air and pirouhettes swinging one sword after another like a helicopter blade from hell
in the liquid world of slo mo the short sword cuts through smiths outstretched fingers sending them flying
the long sword grazes his forearm cutting through the fabric and taking off a slice of flesh
the tip of the sword slices through his suit cutting his tie off digging about an inch into his torso
smith collapses into the dust his face a mask of blood and dust
he doesnt try to get up
razor passes morpheus who backs up to the ringing phone booth
razor goes through first
morpheus keeps his eyes and weapon locked on smith who makes no attempt to pursue
he stands calmly and in a dignified manner wipes dust off his clothing as he watches morpheus step into the booth and replace the phone
one hand on the receiver morpheus stares back at smith
smith stands there not attempting to pursue
morpheus pauses taking advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy
smith stares at the booth for a second
emotion twists his face first anger then perhaps sadness
hell be in the matrix forever
with a quicksilver flash his body reverts back to the shape of the rookie cop
the young man is left standing there
he is filthy bloody badly sliced up and the fingers of one hand are missing
he looks around at the carnage as his mouth simply opens and closes reflexively in shock
he focuses on morpheus
the rebel answers the phone and disappears leaving the cop his body broken and his mind blown
circa helps morpheus off the interface chair
razor is triumphant
did you see that
we beat him
a fucking agent
he gave up
morpheus unflappable rises and rushes to the operations consoles
where is neo
havent heard from him
the city is still cut off from the rest of the matrix
morpheus appears enraged
he looks at neo supine on his chair
why does it still exist
why hasnt he destroyed it yet
maybe he cant
trinity is sitting on the edge of her interface chair looking like hell
is he even alive
is he captured
last we saw he was trying to blow up the building
havent locked onto him since
call me crazy but i think hes masking his own displacement signature
his carrier signal just goes nowhere
but there is data going back and forth
morpheus stares at the data on the screens
the matrix lives
he pushes razor out of the way and starts hacking at the keyboard at an incredible rate
its obvious morpheus can handle computers
i found him once
ill find him again
we go deeper into the miasma of green symbols swallowed by the blackness of the screen and emerge into the apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished
gregory sits on a leather couch watching whatever on the tube with the sound off
he absentmindedly manipulates a quarter over and around his fingers
finally he stops and looks at the quarter
holding it between his thumb and forefinger he folds it in half as though it was a disk of bubble gum
he folds it again then rools it as though its a musket ball
chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch
she reaches points the remote at the tv but gregory puts his hand over it to get her attention
so you really dont have any idea how you got here
i only remember being on the bike
yeah you took a pretty good knock on the head
do you know how we got this place
she looks at him annoyed
we broke in
we dont own a penthouse
what if i said we did
id say youre insane
she finally gets the remote and changes the channel
the volume comes on louder and infinitely more tinny and obnoxious than anything in life
chandra laughs at the images as gregory stares into space
neo sits with his back against a blackened brick wall staring ahead
hes in the belfry of an ancient destroyed cathedral among the pigeon nests soot and bird crap
from here in downtown we can see the modern uptown section with its gleaming skyscrapers
metacortex still stands illuminated by searchlights
neo sits and broods
isolated his world turned upside down and right side out in less than a week his mind and spirit are a blank
again he tries his cell phone
he collapses it and puts it
just as it leaves his mind it rings
the face flips open
neo puts it to his ear without speaking
neos grim expression is melted by relief
you wont believe what happened
i couldnt do it
morpheus theres a problem
morpheus has the headset on
he stands and surveys neo
yes there is a problem
the matrix exists
neos relief fades into confusion
and the problem is
uh its impossible
if the matrix is destroyed the people within the system will die
they will all die
there has to be a different way
morpheus doesnt respond
did you know this
we hear nothing
neo can hear his own heart beating
anger and confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries
i didnt say things would be easy neo
neo sinks to the ground shocked
he shakes his head
morpheus isnt happy about what he has to tell his protege but there is no bending his will
the others look on soberly
neo the matrix
its not real
and its up to you to end it
neo cant stand the reality of the situation
hes coming apart
no morpheus this cant be
we cant do this
we have to get the people out
even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their defenses theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people
they wouldnt even want to be woken up
neo is silent
you can do it
you can free us
why the fuck do i have to do this
morpheus is silent for a long while
everyone is watching morpheus and no one can quite believe what is happening
you know what needs to be done
time is short
make up your mind
the only way youre getting out of the matrix is through its destruction
morpheus kills the connection
neo hears the line click dead
he cant believe what has happened
morpheus drops the headset on the operations console
he types a few commands on the keyboard then addresses the crew
no one goes in
hes on his own
he leaves the main deck
trinity stares at neo for a moment her face fighting for composure no one looks at her
she walks away then leans against the bulkhead her body shaking
neo closes the cell phone
he reaches to tuck it away then pauses looking at it
he drops it to the ground and walks on
he stands out on a finger of crumbling church the night air all around him
the city lights are alive below
he focuses on the metacortex building
leaving him there we rush to it until we dive into the dark shadows of the very building going microscopically close until the darkness gives way to the glowing green
miasma of quantum code
it fills the screen before we bust through into darkness again
