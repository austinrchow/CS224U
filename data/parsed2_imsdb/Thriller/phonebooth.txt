b if window
href b b phone booth by larry cohen the sidewalks crowded as usual
a sea of humanity
people come and go always in a hurry
oblivious of one another
a traffic jam a street being torn up by construction workers a sanitation truck loading up refuse vendors peddling nuts and salted pretzels panhandlers blocking a passerby
were surrounded by the teeming life of the city as weve come to expect it complete with a cacophony of sound
multiple cuts phone kiosks and phone booths on the east side and west side uptown and down
one frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he takes it out on the equipment smashing the receiver violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
into a dozen pieces
there are pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of new york
many of them are still in working order
new yorkers on the phone in extreme close up
we dont hear the words
only the facial expressions inform us that these are human beings under tremendous pressure
life in the city is wearing them down
lips jabbering into receivers
cross cut against one another
despite increased usage of cellular devices an estimated four and a half million new yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis
at thirty five cents a pop
for the first three minutes
theres a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the street
youre looking at the telephone booth at the corner of th street and th avenue in the heart of the manhattan theatrical district
it has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk
its one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city
camera moves in on the irate caller in the booth a very well dressed gray haired lady totally conservative in appearance
into receiver you have lied to me for the last time you lowlife prick bastard
i dont ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again
listens yes well fuck you too
she slams down the receiver and exits
the booth remains vacant for a brief interval
at least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth
the coins are collected twice a day
this booth has been burglarized forty one times in the last six months
someone is approaching the booth fishing in his pocket for coins
this is stuart shepard snappily dressed his hair styled and his nails manicured
here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself
he sports a donna karen suit and silk armani tie
hes about to step into the booth when hes accosted by a middle aged man in a soiled apron whos run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught
up with him
stu we got to talk
wish i could accommodate you mario but this is my busy time of day
how come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant
why dont i stop in later for some lunch
theres no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said
im doing my level best for you people
one lousy mention in the post and you expect to eat for six months
i got the food critic from the village voice all lined up to give you a review
thats what you tell me last july
and he never shows
i was allowing you time to expand the menu
wallpaper the bathrooms for god sakes
you get only one shot with these fucking critics and i dont want you to blow a rare opportunity
you the one blowing it
how long you think you can fuck everybody
hold on right there
ive got a very excellent reputation around this town
so how come you take two nice suits of clothes from harry and never get his daughter on david letterman
hell im not an agent
im a publicist
mister youre nothing
believe me valeries on the waiting list to audition
harrys got no complaints
he just let me pick out this tie the other day
that harrys a damn fool
mario please let me make this up to you
how about i arrange for the opening night party for this new off broadway show im handling to be held at your place with local tv coverage on nine and
i mean i had it promised to another client who actually pays me money
but it isnt firmed up yet
and i could throw it your way
what is involved
youd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty
the producers would supply their own vino of course
id deliver you a truckload of celebrities
and if they like the food theyll all come back naturally
you want liza minelli
an oscar winner
or douglas fairbanks jr
is he still alive
i saw him last night going into the four seasons
ill bring you over a whole vip list when we come by for dinner
how come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay
you cant think small like that
hey you still feature musicians fridays and saturdays
at least they work for their meals
what about harrys daughter as an extra added attraction
shell belt out five or six showtunes two sets a night and it wont cost you a fucking nickel
let me handle setting that up
and when she eventually goes on letterman shell announce im currently appearing over at marios fine supper club
right over cbs shell say that mario
youre full of shit
you know that
thats just a vulgar word for pr
placing an arm around him mario you cant hurt my feelings
even when i was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way it never bothered me
other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name
me i just loved the attention
shit for brains thats what the bigger kids named me
and i answered to it
hey shit for brains reporting for duty
everybody loved me for that
i could take abuse
after a while i kind of wore them down
there was nothing more they could say to me
so they stopped
i kind of missed it
im sorry i even talked to you
ill bet your loving wife put you up to this
she saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street
but i dont hold it against you personally you still serve up superior veal chop
entering phone booth now i got urgent business to conduct mario
he slides the booth closed in marios face
the frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass before giving up and walking off talking to himself as he goes up the block
inside the booth stu inserts his thirty five cents and dials
hello mavis sweet creature
where have you been
do you think i have nothing to do but wait around for you to call
im only a few minutes late loveliest individual on earth
stu im so lonely
when can i see you
good news in that arena
kelly goes into rehearsal as of monday
you know how dedicated she is
by the time she gets back from dancing her ass off she goes right to sleep
well have both our days and certain nights
not to mention when they take the show on the road
how long is that for
four to five weeks minimum
maybe i should quit my job so we can be together full time
i wouldnt do that
sometimes i think if i have to give one more fucking manicure
thats how you met me
i never saw a worse set of nails
bit right down to the quick
im much better groomed since youve been looking after me
im glad you admit it
even kelly remarked on it when i first met her
she could care less how you look
shes only interested in pushing her own career
some wife youre stuck with
the marriage is not without its compensations
do you imagine i could afford that apartment on what im earning
not with everybody cutting back on the publicity
not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out
and one thing you cant expect from your clients is loyalty
they get a couple of bad notices they dump you
i wasnt saying goodbye to you
i was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a months notice
a conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it
he deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience
this bothers stu who slides the booth open a crack
is your watch busted
its twenty after eleven and im gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction
so get out of my face
he closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs
there will be no further interruption
why must you always be calling me from some booth
on account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings
and i dont want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either
she gets the mail
she looks these items over
sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is
then she suspects something
its only because her last husband the choreographer ran around on her
she cant get that out of her head
thats how she caught onto him
the phone bills
she hasnt developed much skill at holding a man
you know what a self fulfilling prophecy is
she was so sure i was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you
i thought id feel all guilty about it but i guess it hasnt kicked in yet
beat still i wouldnt do anything to hurt her
basically kellys a decent individual
what about hurting me
like last time
you were glad to be rid of me
for a while i was til i took stock of what was around
youre the lesser of many evils
thats about the nicest thing you ever said
ill have it engraved
weve been up front with each other from the beginning
lets keep it that way
how about a drink
say seven oclock
the monkey bar
meet me in front
i dont like walking in there unescorted
yeah youre great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls
it happens all the time lately
and wear that short black number i bought you from bendels
i dont know if its me or that dress you like
have a good day
make plenty of tips
and leave the whole evening open
she thinks ive got knicks tickets
he hangs up
then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket flips it open and dials
someone answers on the first ring
into cellular its your boy stuart
when was the last time i called you for a favor
the column is already full
i just need one line
anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at marios stromboli restaurant
maybe you dont hear so good
i got no space for you
whos asking any favors
im offering reciprocal information
since when were you ever a reliable source
check it out
tony award winning producer willie beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the
i got it from the doorman
i got it from their maid yesterday
its in the paper today
or dont you bother to read my shit
louis my intentions were entirely honorable
ill drop your item in sometime next week
if you promise not to call me for a month
he hangs up
stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away
then he starts to vacate the booth
the phone rings
curious he picks up the receiver
theres a voice on the other end of the line
a distinctive male voice
dont even think about leaving that booth
stay exactly where you are and listen carefully
ive got a heavy day mister
you know better than to disobey me
i dont know you at all
are you absolutely sure
who is this
someone whos watching you
love the gray suit
that red and black tie makes a nice combination
stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel
he looks around nervously
where are you
closer than you think
i dont see you
there are any number of windows
check them out
indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels
okay you had your little joke
im not sufficiently amused
we have more to talk about
stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to
perhaps its the strange tone of the mans voice
do me a favor
call up somebody else
but its you im interested in
you know how many people use that booth every day
why dont you tell me
better than two hundred people on average
is that what you do
what else do i have to do
its interesting watching people
trying to guess who they are
and what theyre up to
what are you a shut in of some kind
you might say that
i cant go out
i might be seen
somebodys looking for you
the ex wife
whatd you do run out on child support
what kind of man do you think i am
frankly i could care less
you had your fun
its not in your best interests to hang up on me
that would make me angry
isnt that just too bad
theres ten million names in the phonebook
pester somebody else
i never talk to people i cant see
i need to study their reactions
alright bullshit artist what am i doing right now
scratching your forehead with your left hand
now youre brushing your hair back
okay okay you got me in your scrutiny
so lets talk
only i got nothing to say
oh you will
youll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over
and itll only end when i want it to
is that a fact
well if you watch closely you will see me hang up
i dont think you will
i interest you
why should i be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths
but youre not a stranger stu
the sound of his own name sends a chill through him
who put you up to this
you were my very own selection
why me in particular
because youre so afraid
whatve i got to be afraid of
just about everything
you have so much to hide
how do you figure that
why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth
thats my business
ive made it mine
all of a sudden im required to give explanations to you
in explicit detail
what is this
some kind of candid camera gag
or like that thing on hbo where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat
this is not showbusiness my friend
this is reality
not mine you lowlife fuck
stu youll be made to suffer for your attitude so lets dispense with the vulgarities
now youre threatening me
could that be any clearer
youre only making it easier for me to do you harm
can you see how im trembling
you will be
shit this is a new one
fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth
when are you going to start with the heavy breathing
im not the degenerate
you are stu
you dont know anything about me
infinitely more than you know about me
like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth
how would you know that
im watching through a scope and i could clearly read the buttons you pushed
i have another extension here by the window
shall i dial that same number back for you
would that convince you
stu nervously cranes his neck looking around at all the tall buildings that surround the street corner
panning up at thousands of windows
the voice could be coming from anywhere
lets see whos on the other end of the line
beat its already ringing
ill hold the receiver up so you can listen in
stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings
then mavis voice can be heard answering
stu listens helplessly
who is this
someone whos really tight with your boyfriend who just called you from his favorite phone booth
you know stu
oh i know him better than anyone
what he does how he thinks
how he lies
who the hell is this
stu is listening in
he knows what were both saying
is that true
are you there
he doesnt feel like talking
just hang up the goddam phone
she cant hear you stu
a pause mavis im afraid stu hasnt been totally honest with you
but then he cant be honest with anyone can he
whats your name
to whom am i speaking
youve never heard of me mavis
he doesnt want you to know i exist
he wishes i didnt exist
but there isnt anything he can do about that
beat still there stu
all you can do is listen
mavis the guy is a fucking nutcase
hang the fuck up
she doesnt want to
she wants to know all about us
dont you mavis
did his wife put you up to this
that bitch kelly
oh yes the bitch wife kelly
my very next call
yells he doesnt know my wife
dont tell him anything else
outside the booth a huge heavy set black woman in a too tight dress now appears with the clear desire to use the phone
her name is felicia
she taps on the glass
could you hurry it along
stu ignores her and felicia glares at him through the glass with hostility
stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else
hes too distracted by the madness happening over the telephone
can you hear me mavis
keep your big mouth shut
is that any way to talk to a woman you love
beat mavis is he always that abusive to you
youre getting me all upset
i dont know who you are or how you know all this i find out things from watching people and listening to them
just what is your relationship to stu
thats all i want to know
well what do you think
answer me goddam it
stu and i are longtime companions
two of a kind
closer than close
peas in a pod
spoons in a drawer
dont believe a word of it
its all lies
too late stu
she already believes it
you can tell that scumbag never to bother me again
he wont care
hell still have me
its not true
i do care
from outside the booth theres a louder rapping on the glass
felicia really wants in
get done in there mister
i got me an important call
shit i will
she continues to rap on the glass as stu tries to focus on the two way phone call
why dont you tell me what you think of us
youre both disgusting
thats what he said about you
well if stu didnt have the balls to come out and tell you the truth i felt it was my responsibility to clear the air
goodbye now mavis
thanks for your time
the phone clicks off we hear only a dial tone back to you again stu
you total asshole
how could you do that
speaking of females that woman hovering outside the booth may as well tell her that youll be on the line forever
like hell i will
im ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home
and this time ill listen in
theres no chance of that
or should i call kelly and make up something totally outrageous
you must realize by now i have a vivid imagination
you dont know our phone number
are you absolutely sure
i may have been watching you on a regular basis
keeping track of all the numbers i see you dial
and im supposed to believe that
ive put a great deal of preparation into this prior to actually saying hello
now do you want to dial or should the sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even more than the earlier mention of his name
what are you going to tell her
youll do the talking
what am i supposed to say
try telling her the truth
look i dont want to hurt kelly
shes always there for me
its just my nature to have a little strange on the side
it doesnt mean shit
but you still find it necessary
kind of like having a beautiful home
with everything you ever dreamed of
but you still need that vacation now and then
some nice hotel room with a great view
maybe a pool
only you wouldnt want to spend more than a few days in any hotel
eventually you want to go back to your home and all your stuff
youre real glad to check out
kelly is home and mavis is a hotel
im sure theyll both appreciate that explanation
youre ruining my fucking life you sonofabitch
didnt i warn you about calling me names
it makes me vindictive
what else can you do to me
we havent even begun
shes not home
she went out
ill bet shes back
now hold the cellular up where i can see it so i can be certain you dont misdial on me
pause a little higher and to your left
now i have it in perfect view
more violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black lady outside
if you got you a cell phone how come you taking up the whole fucking booth
this heres an emergency
theres another booth on the next block
every damn phone on eighth avenue is busted but this one
well im not through
go in a restaurant or someplace but get away from me
im gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded
she tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but stu jams it shut right on her hand
you assaulted my person
let me hear from your lawyer
youre hear alright
im coming back
and your ass better not be around
she stalks off obviously in search of assistance
good work stu
now let me see you dial
tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote
im doing it
he punches in the digits
the phone rings and rings
i told you she was out
let it ring
then a girls voice is heard
hold it close to the receiver so i can hear
honey its me
whats taking you so long
i thought we were having some lunch at marios
change of plan
were not eating in that dump any more
the health department gave them a c rating thats how come
here im trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem
okay ill fix us a sandwich
where are you now
just in a phone booth
the caller id says youre on your cellular
oh yeah i am
but youre also in some phone booth
explain that one stu
i only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside
well just hurry on back
tell her you cant
not for a few minutes
are you sure youre alone
i hear somebody in the background
the guy in the next booth
hes got a bad connection and hes hollering his fool head off
youve got an answer for everything
i love you baby
you know that
stu who was that man
some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago just after you went out
i dont understand
this total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone because youd be calling me in a few minutes from a booth
and i said what would he be doing in any phone booth
and what did this guy say
he said youd be making phone calls
making calls is part of my business
planting items like i do
once in a while one of them could be a woman
i just called elaines and talked to her to see who was in there last night
you know exactly what i mean
youre not going to start that shit again
i just feel something is wrong
what could be wrong
the way you sound
you dont sound like yourself
who do i sound like
someone whos scared
theres fear in your voice like ive never heard before
kelly agrees with me
i want you to come back home
i told you
in a while
i want you here now
in case he calls back i dont want to answer again
why should he call back
i feel like hes going to
youre the one that sounds frightened
and of nobody
hes not a nobody
he knows about us
youre not telling me all he said
what are you holding back
i cant discuss it on the phone
just get over here
she hangs up
into pay phone why did you do that to her
she never did you any harm
how would you know
everybody does harm to somebody
and then they try their best to forget it
maybe me but not her
whatever ive done theres no reason to take it out on her
suppose thats the only way i can get to you
you claim you love her
yeah i do
you dont even love yourself
i would never hurt
still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole
listen ive treated all my women decent
i never laid a hand on any of them even when provoked
and i always let them down easy
beat im not ready to let kelly go
maybe i never will be
what if she dumps you first
whats the odds shes already taken up with somebody
one day soon youll come home and find her gone along with the cd player and the im not gonna let you mind fuck me all day
this call is ended
not until i say it is
what happens if i hang up
you dont really want to find out
im dying to hear this
what the fuck can you do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddam binoculars
i never indicated i had binoculars
i said i had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close i could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning
oh while youre at it have a look up my ass
i may very well do that stu
in the meantime think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it
like a rifle
a high powered
calibre bolt action remington with a carbon one modification and a state of the art henzholdt tactical sniperscope
and youre in the cross hairs stu
im supposed to believe that
theres only one way i can prove it to you
hang up the receiver and find out
at this range the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine
and youre just going to kill me for no reason
for plenty of reasons
because you hung up
for years i hated people hanging up on me
women i didnt even know
i get hung up on all the time
you get used to it
or else you dont
i worked for months getting people to switch to mci being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day
the ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply
then why didnt you go after one of them
maybe you are one of them
hey i have worked in a boiler room myself peddling term life
i would never be rude to a fellow salesperson
can you feel it on you now
the heat of it
im moving the strike zone down to your stomach area
now im raising it up again
directly above the chest cavity sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear
shit i do feel it
tell me where im going with it now
across my forehead now back where it was before
im amazed how you can do that
youre amazingly accurate
beat now i know what youre thinking
if i drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out
no im not thinking that
oh yes you are
can i crawl out using the booth as a shield
can i crawl to that chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away
the shattering glass may cut me but itll only be superficial
otherwise this lunatic will never let me out alive
i know you will
if i just cooperate
where is it now
think and feel for the warm spot
below the shoulder
the right shoulder
remarkable how were in tune
youre doing far better than the others
what do you mean
no reply you said others
finally im sure you read about the italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of forty fifth and eighth
i saw it on the news
and where are we now
forty fifth and eighth
what else do you remember about that killing
i dont know
he was gunned down
and nobody was caught
and they didnt even bother to take his wallet or his watch
now you know why
it wasnt a robbery
what did he do
he hung up so i disconnected him permanently
please dont do it to me
you got no reason to do it to me
dont give me reason
im not looking to
tell me what you want
tell me about your job
whats to tell
im in public relations
they used to call us flacks
now were media consultants
what do you do exactly
plant items in the paper and on the tube
more important sometimes keep stuff out
whatve you kept out
one of my people got nailed for indecent exposure
i managed for the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it
you saved the little deviates ass didnt you
hes in major therapy now
i swear he is
you must hang with some major celebrities
journalists newscasters those types
im real close with larry king
and the hard copy people
could you get him down here
why would he want to come here
because you asked him to
he comes from atlanta
well who could you get
i dont know
definitely no chance
youd be offering them an exclusive newsbreak
im talking about more than one homicide
i dont answer questions
i ask them
i gotta have the facts
they might not believe me
my record isnt too good when it comes to hard news
youre not considered a reliable source
on a divorce or separation maybe
or whos gay or who isnt gay any more
i kind of specialize in that kind of material
i mean i could probably get you joe franklin
how about cindy adams
i might have a shot
are you familiar with liz smith
do you know her number
want i should call her
how much can i say
tell her youre in direct touch with a killer whos willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities
she usually likes to have a celebrity involved
if you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me thered be better odds shes come
pick a celebrity and put them in the booth
who does she like
who couldnt be reached to deny it
im anxious to see you in action
dont keep me waiting
stu uses his cellular again
dialing sometimes you only get her service
into cellular hi stu shepard
put me through
ive got hard news for her
i can only talk to her directly
but say it regards liza
that was imaginative
into cellular no i cant call back
ill have to lay in on somebody else
alright but i cant hang on long
to pay phone shes coming on
to cellular liz hello
sure ill make it brief
killing two weeks ago in the theatre district
turn out a sniper did the job
yeah a sniper with a rifle
now hes got another victim lined up
not just your anonymous new yorker but liza
now you cant call anybody or ms
minellis dead meat and so am i
shes hostage in a phone booth right in the snipers sights
but he says hell talk to you and let her walk
i know itll take balls to do this but youre a fine and courageous newspaper woman
theres a click
to pay phone either shes on her way over or she doesnt believe me
you werent particularly convincing
i didnt really believe in what i was saying
because you dont really believe my remington is pointed at you
youre ninety percent sure
at least ninety five percent easy
let me erase all doubt
control yourself stu
glance down at your chest
what do you see
oh my god
a fucking red dot
a tiny red dot now moves across stus chest
like youve seen in the movies
the laser dot
just before some poor bastard always gets blown away
usually a supporting player
that lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead
the tiny red laser dot dances around stus chest and stomach the jumps up and remains between his eyes
this takes all the guesswork out of it
you know exactly where to expect it before i even tighten my finger on the trigger
dont even tickle that fucking finger
how about geraldo
hes run his ass off to get in on this
youre talking about the old geraldo
look i can try and reach cable nbc
i wanted to go first class
they do a great job
theyll haul a whole crew over to cover your surrender live
i never expressed interest in giving myself up
there are so many other phone booths in the city
im just getting warmed up
thats entirely up to you
im just trying to set you up with the proper communicator
beat i suppose liza wasnt strong enough
i shouldve said madonna
now youre being creative
outside the booth the angry black woman has returned bringing with her a gaudily dressed pimp named leon who looks like he means business
he slams his fist against the glass nearly shattering it
drag your baggy butt out of that booth
we got business to conduct out of there
he been in there all day
im not through
hang up that receiver or ill make you eat the fucking thing
fuck off or ill call a cop
do you see one around here
what you think im gonna be doing while youre waiting for a prowl car to get assigned
im about to cut you a second asshole if you dont vacate those premises
hes got him a fucking cellular
whats he need to be on our booth for
i cant explain it
im not interested in your explanations even if you had any
he withdraws a switchblade knife from his pocket but doesnt open it yet
if i flick this i use it
ill make it worth your while to go away
how much do you want
make me an offer
its all ive got in cash
take it and go
youre offering to rent my phone booth
for how long
i dont know
for as long as it takes
whats so special in there
do you want the money
is that a genuine rolex youve got on
come on man
thats my good watch
thats what its gonna take
take the damn thing
and the thirty
take it all
the pimp pockets the watch and the money
but doesnt go away
now im satisfied
but you still got to deal with felicia here
i believe you spoke harshly to her
and did her some injury
im sorry about that too
the man dont sound like he means it
to stu why dont you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length
its long distance
i cant lose the call i might not get them back
do i have to rip that fucking phone out of there
that wouldnt be a good idea
into pay phone would it
not at all
i gave you everything ive got
that pinky ring looks attractive
felicia might like that
it might fit
you want the ring youve got the ring
if i can get it off
i can get it off you
leon reaches in and grabs stus ring hand
let go of me
its coming loose
he tosses it okay felicia with my deepest apologies
whats really going on in that booth that escapes the naked eye
that your connection on the end of the line
or are you dealing
this has nothing to do with drugs
you gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night
i knew it smelled for some reason
you look like youre ready to piss yourself
because i am
maybe if the city provided decent public toilets folks wouldnt relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths
ill take it up with the mayor
next thing you know youre gonna claim we mugged you took your billfold and watch
no you didnt
it was a fair and equitable deal
you had territorial rights to this booth and i paid a license fee
fair is fair
now leave me in peace
you sure youre alright
to felicia he dont look well
kind of pale
even for a white man
jaundice they calls it
probably advanced liver trouble
to stu if its cirrhosis you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick
thanks for your interest but im in perfect health
so how come his hand is shaking
the man is cracking up
lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch
thats one sick mother you started up with leon
youre the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs
im terminal okay
now can i close the booth and continue my conversation
im worried now it might be catching
all that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease
give it back
what goods that
we done touched it
well go wash your hands
come on now
own up to what youre carrying
is it some of that sexually transmitted shit
cause in that case we can relax
im sick of you
now get out of my face
here wes being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse
whip his arrogant ass
leon reaches into the booth and grabs stus jacket
touch me and ill throw up on you
at the suggestion leon lets go quickly
it looks like a stalemate
stu isnt vacating the booth and leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further
he does indeed look sick
into pay phone you can see what im up against here
want me to get rid of him for you
what do you have in mind
ill think of something
suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp
leon doesnt realize its there
the hooker behind him has no way of seeing it
but to stu theres no way to miss it
into pay phone dont
its not necessary
you asked for my help
ill handle it myself
youre not doing too well
i can settle it in a fraction of a second
shall i demonstrate
to leon for your own safety mister just walk away
now the man is turning aggressive
issuing threats upon my person
youre making this happen
if you dont hang up and step out im about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it
reluctant to touch stu again leon assaults the booth itself
he begins shaking it violently trying to rip it from its foundation
and the rickety booth is not too sturdy
it starts rocking back and forth
stu is thrown around inside it barely keeping his footing
into pay phone this isnt my fault
shouts stop that
but leon continues rocking the booth
it wont come loose so in frustration he punches in a side pane of glass
the glass shatters all around stu who does his best to shield himself from the slivers
into pay phone the guys insane
only one way to stop a mad dog
give me permission
if he forces you out of that booth ive told you what to expect
you or him stu
leon is smashing other panes of glass now one after another as stu cowers inside
dont cut yourself honey
a crowd of derelicts and street people are now gathering to watch the out of control pimp take out his wrath on the booth and its occupant
looks like the fucker is comin loose
shove it out into the oncoming traffic
whatll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet
the booth is being decimated but stu hangs onto the phone
into pay phone hello
with heavy static youre breaking up
were about to be cut off
i cant help it
that counts as a hang up
thats not fair
i can still make him stop
say the word
can you hear me
stu sees the red dot reappear on leons chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks
then leon recoils staggers a step backward
he doesnt realize hes been shot
theres been no sound of gunfire
perhaps a silencer was used or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge
leon looks confused at first
his ladyfriend has no idea hes wounded neither do the derelicts and street people whove assembled on the corner
even stu isnt sure until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimps chest staining his yellow vest
he isnt assaulting the booth anymore
hes trying to keep his balance
he slumps forward hanging onto the booth for support only a few inches from stus face
the blood runs down the side of the booth
into pay phone you did it
you said yes
i said yes i can hear you
not yes kill the motherfucker
dont try to renege on it
i was following orders
youre twisting it all around
i didnt do this
meanwhile leon leans upright against the booth
then his legs cave in and he begins to slide to his knees
felicia runs up beside him
she sees the blood
i warned you not to cut yourself
to crowd look at all that blood
he mustve hit an artery
she screams as leon topples backwards onto the pavement
now his chest wound is evident
what is that
talk to me
the crowd tightens around the fallen body
street people who are fascinated but not shocked
sucking chest wound right over the heart
somebody call an ambulance
call the meatwagon
hes fucked up
you shut the fuck up
her focus turns to stu in the battered phone booth
why did you do that to him
to crowd you all saw it
he shot my man without no provocation
pumped one right into him at close range
how could i
i dont even have a gun
everybody get the fuck back
they shoot one then they shoot everybody in sight
kill all the fucking witnesses
the crowd disperses to doorways and around the corner out of immediate range
youve got to see im not armed
only felicia remains leaning over the pimps body staring helplessly
hang up and dial
get a doctor
i cant hang up
thats what this is all about
youre gonna stand there and let him die
takes out cellular i can use this
he dials emergency
theres been a shooting at forty fifth and eighth on the corner
a man is down
whats the difference who i am
i dont want to be involved
shouts thats bullshit
hes the shooter
youre talking to the shooter
stu quickly disconnects the cellular
that wasnt nice
go ahead make a fucking run for it
i hope they gun you down like you did him
im not going anyplace
im staying right here in this booth
into pay phone unless you give me permission
youre attracting a lot of attention
i suppose when the police get there youll accuse me
what do you expect me to say
thats up to you
but any mention of me will not be appreciated
you wont even get to finish your sentence
oh look that little red dot is dancing around all over you again
you saw how quickly it can happen
and how accurate i can be
they cant blame me im not armed
whos going to believe that
with all those witnesses to the contrary
they can see with their own eyes
not far away we hear the blast of police sirens drawing closer
remember to leave me out of it
how can i
youll put the proper spin on it
isnt that your specialty
feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth and making it totally believable
this isnt a story
this is real
this is murder
if youd only dealt with the man reasonably shown him some respect this might not have been necessary
i gave him my money my watch
but not your respect
which is what he required of you
he was a fucking thief
and now hes a fucking dead thief
do you feel better about that
i dont feel a bit guilty
this is all your doing
now youre being disrespectful of me
you never learn
your job is to deal with people but youre not good at it
hey im not taking any more criticism from some lunatic sniper who gets his kicks killing strangers
you keep insisting im a stranger
probably because you dont recognize the voice
but there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice
i might not even be a man
i might be one of those many women youve almost totally forgotten
one who doesnt forgive easily
one who wants to watch you squirm
youre a man
i know youre a man
women dont kill with telescopic rifles
they stab you
you sound so sure of that
but youve never provoked any man as much as have the women in your life
and so many of them stu
a beat do you even remember their names
ive got no time to rehash my whole life
oh my god
the cops are here
police cars are pulling up on all sides of eighth avenue
traffic has suddenly been shut down
prowl cars have now blocked the streets
production note everything is seen from stus perspective without intercuts
half a dozen cops now emerge and approach with drawn guns
pointing thats him in the booth
hes got a gun
as she hurls accusations shes lugging leons lifeless body out into the gutter into the center of eighth avenue
its a bright afternoon
in the distance we hear the maddening honking of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers
whose horns provide their simplest form of protest
its a discordant concert that echoes the confusion and frustration which stu now feels
as the cops surround the booth at a distance
into bullhorn throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised
into phone theyre ordering me to come out
i can see that
what if they open fire
they probably wont
look across on the east side of the street
do you see the tourist with the home video camera
a distant crowd gathering on the opposite west side corner behind the police cars
some tourist is capturing the event on video
what about him
hes going to keep the police on their best behavior
so long as you dont take what could be interpreted as hostile action youll be safe
you call this safe
six cops with guns pointed my way
you want me to reduce them to three or two
absolutely no more shooting
now is that clear
you can always change your mind
with bullhorn you know the drill
hands clasped behind the back of your neck moving slowly step out of the booth
if we see any sign of a weapon we will respond
shouts you wont because there isnt any
bullhorn i repeat
raise your hands
im on a phone call
now a black police captain arrives and takes full command of the situation
you have thirty seconds to comply
i told you
come back later
very good stu
the cops take cover behind parked cars keeping stu clearly in their sights
he has no place to hide
hes in the battered phone booth in plain view from all sides
youve been given an order
the sergeant slides up beside the captain to confer
production note we remain in long shot of the cops always from stus pov
but we can hear their voices and all that is said as if they were in close up
it has an odd unreal and distancing effect
were dealing with a mental case
hes looking for us to kill him
well hes not getting his wish
in the center of the street an ambulance pulls up and a team of medics jump out
they rush to leons body
again we hear their voices close even though visually they are far off
tell me hes gonna be alright
let us look at him
the medics push her aside then examine the victim
hes nothing we can do
dont touch the body
theyll need it to mark the crime scene
far across the street the captain confers with his subordinates
they are small figures on the screen but we hear them sharply
same corner as two weeks ago
maybe its more than a coincidence
i need to talk to him
youve got your vest on
what do you think
the captain steps out of cover and boldly approaches the phone booth
he stops cautiously about fifteen feet away
im not armed
neither am i
i need to know what happened
cant talk about it
sure you can
my names ramey
captain ed ramey
look i dont want to be friends
you look like you need a friend
tell him youve already got a friend
yells ive got a friend okay
is that who youre talking to on the phone
none of your business
when somebody gets shot it becomes my business
lets not have anybody else killed
i want to hear your side of it
ive got no side of it
dont worry stu
ive got him fixed right in my sights
i wont let him hurt you
has this happened to you before
the need to hurt someone
to put a bullet in them
you wont believe anything i say
i couldnt shoot anybody
im not armed
i dont believe you
whats that bulge in your pants pocket
thats my cellular
then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls
do you want to see it
dont reach for it mister
then how can i show it to you
i dont need to see it
i know whats there
all these witnesses saw you use it on him
from behind a parked car a homeless person calls out
hollers damn straight
another derelict crouched in a doorway joins in
shot him down like a dog
theyre all lying
nobody saw it because it didnt happen
a man is dead but it didnt happen
not on account of me
this is like some bad dream
youre walking through a bad dream and you cant wake up
do you want to wake up
and in this dream you killed that man
he was bothering you so you iced him
then who did
dont tell him stu
or itll be the last thing he ever hears
his blood will be on your hands
to ramey i dont know
but you saw it happen
you were the closest one to him
you mustve seen who did it
were trying to be honest with each other arent we
im losing patience with this cop
into phone im handling this
who do you keep talking to on the phone
youre getting good at this
whats this doctors name
its important we know
he says not to tell you
its privileged information
damn good reply
now youre having fun
whatever you say
playing it so close to the edge
ill bet youve never felt so alive
thats how i feel when i look through the sight and select somebody
the captain begins advancing a few steps closer
i respect your right to privacy
ive been to therapy myself
the department provides it
i know its not good form for a cop to be admitting that but
tell him not to come any closer
stop right there
back up a few steps
back where you were
if it makes you more comfortable
tell him to read you your rights
i want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions
al least tell me your first name
its my right not to have any name
no gun and no name
youre a highly underprivileged person
demand a lawyer
and get me a lawyer too
i want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender
keep winging it
itll be hard to find a lawyer willing to risk his life
but if you hand over the gun
how can i when you wont let me take it out
well take it out for you as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and
interrupts now were back to that again
its always get out of the booth
you cant stay in the booth
well i like it in the fucking booth
its my whole world now
its my booth and im never coming out
were not about to force you because there could be a miscalculation and then wed never find out why this happened
why is it so important to know
the guy is dead
isnt that enough
knowing isnt going to make him alive again
so who gives a fuck
its what makes the job interesting
finding out why
something drove you to do this
you didnt go out today expecting this to happen
it was a nice day
you were out for a walk
and then suddenly it all changed
all i wanted was to make a phone call
one lousy phone call for thirty five fucking cents
dont volunteer too much
you got some bad news on that call
something that pushed you over the edge
and ive been falling ever since
time to land
when you hit bottom you die
im your safety net
if i tell you what you want to know youll die too
something about the implied threat sends a chill through captain ramey
the captains head as seen through a telescopic sight
ramey could be dead in an instant
production note the only time we deviate from stus perspective is when we see the snipers pov through his scope
the detective fifteen feet away
ramey decides to back off momentarily
ill go see about that lawyer
now thats a good idea
the captain withdraws back across the street
i had him centered in my cross hairs
i really had to restrain myself
we hear the approach of a helicopter
stu peers up ward as not one but two choppers appear above the tall buildings
its not the police
its the media
youre news stuart
the helicopters circle above
youve never gotten this much press for any of your clients
im making you a famous person
theyre just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter
their presence is putting the police on their continued best behavior
those cops are just looking for any excuse
then dont give them one
then as if on cue stus cellular phone in his pocket starts ringing
but he cant allows himself to reach for it
to do so might cause the police to believe he was trying to draw his gun
it rings quietly virtually inaudible outside the booth
drowned out by the traffic horns the static from the police radios and the newly introduced sound of television helicopters circling over eighth avenue taking video coverage of the event
who could it be
she was worried about me
stu is afraid to reach in his pocket lest the cops think hes going for a gun
maybe shes seen this on television
it must be on every channel by now
she doesnt watch daytime tv
one of the neighbors couldve alerted her
the cell phone keeps ringing almost drowned out by the sound of helicopters circling overhead
why are you saying this
you want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire
thats an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice ive given in the past
have i ever steered you wrong
god how id love to hear her voice
it might even be worth it
shes insistent isnt she
the cellular wont stop ringing
if she knows im in trouble she wont give up
probably glued to the tv by now
im watching coverage on two stations now
pause well there you are on two and four and five
not any decent angles on you though stuck inside there
the cell phone continues beeping until the sound of it is maddening
stu is still afraid to reach for it and provide the cops with an excuse to open fire
but if youd take one or two steps outside and look up i think they could get a clear picture of you
you said im not allowed to leave the booth
finally the cell phone stops ringing
i might be willing to bend the rules and let you enjoy your moment of fame
set the phone down without hanging up
and take a step or two outside
just for a minute
then come straight back in or ill be forced to provide live coverage that should rival the historic zapruder footage
beat nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest
ill stay where i am
it was only a suggestion
since youre convinced im going to plug you anyway it cant matter much
if you shoot me you give yourself away
even without a muffler theyd never hear the report with all this noise
afterwards itd take them a good ten minutes to realize you werent plugged by some overzealous officer
then theyll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the swat teams job for them
you expected them to come
you had this all worked out
i write the scenario and you all play your parts as directed
the damned cell phone starts beeping again
stu fights the temptation to grab for it and hear kellys voice for one last time
what she must be going through
why dont you tell her how you feel about her
id never get the words out
not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me
you cant be certain theyd fire
theyd see it was only a phone
they wouldnt wait to see
the cellular ringing continues jangling stus nerves
why doesnt she hang up
then stu notices something in the crowd gathering far across the street behind the police barricades
countless faces rubbernecking probably hoping to see some display of violence that would end with him face down dead on the pavement
and in the midst of them one face familiar to him
a female quite pretty
even in tears
we see her only in long shot a distant figure in bright green jacket that makes her stand out from the crowd
shes not calling me
shes over there
the blonde girl in the green jacket
cant miss her
very attractive isnt she
she mustve heard all the commotion and come downstairs
the cellular is still ringing
its somebody else who knows my cell number
beat its you
you continue to impress
why is it so important that they kill me
because thats how i win
this time you wont
if you want me dead youll have to do it yourself
either way i cant lose
its all a game to you because youre incapable of feelings
youre not even human
i pride myself on that
whats so great about being human
its the lowest form of life on this planet and ive taken it upon myself to thin the herd
im not answering back any more
i wont hang up but im not playing
theres silence now between them
stu dont be that way
youre taking the pleasure out of it
stu doesnt take the bait
he remains absolutely silent
a stalemate has been reached
clustered behind an emergency vehicle
the sergeant brings a civilian to meet captain ramey of the swat unit
the newcomer wears coveralls stenciled at t
although they are very far away we hear their voices close up as they come into sharper focus
this heres helfand of new york telephone
glad to help out
have you got the number of that booth
can you tap into that call
it can be done
but not without a warrant
you could be violating this psychos civil rights
especially if hes on the line with his fucking psychiatrist
i dont want to blow this on a technicality
tracing the call isnt any violation is it
as long as we dont listen in
we remain in long shot of the police as they continue in heated conversation
to helfand okay weve got to know who hes talking to and their current location
that i can handle
as long as they keep the circuit open
i need the number and an address to go with it
helfand rushes off
at the corner we can glimpse him entering a phone company utility truck parked on forty fifth street
stu remains tight lipped and silent refusing to give his tormentor the conversation he so craves
stuart my friend
do you want to see how close i can come without actually hitting you
stu resists pleading because he knows his silence is more powerful
theres no glass in the left side of the booth since the late leon smashed it all out
nothing to shatter when the sniper squeezes off his shot
may i call attention to the yellow pages
the frayed yellow phonebook dangling from a chain under the telephone shudders under the impact of a direct hit
theres been no sound of a gunshot but the damage is there to behold
stu reaches for the phonebook
theres a bullet hole straight through it
pieces of the
calibre slug have shattered into many tiny fragments and are imbedded between the pages half way through the thick volume
stu pries pieces out of the pages of the directory
he looks at them in the palm of his hand
hollow points are designed to break up on impact
it wouldve behaved differently if it had pierced your soft flesh
the pieces wouldve bounced around looking for a way out
thats where the real damage occurs finding an exit deflecting off all that bone
stu wants to shout stop but restrains himself
not talking gives him some degree of power
still the silent treatment
my father used to dish that out when he chose to punish me
not a word spoken one time for over a month
id try and goad him to acknowledge i existed but he stared right through me
youre bringing back unhappy childhood stu
thats not wise
stu still declines to answer
his silence seems his only weapon
he tosses the bullet fragments out of the booth onto the pavement
since youre ignoring me ill focus on someone else
a beat there she is nice and sharp
i can see the two little punctures in each earlobe and my god what kind of a girl would have her nostril pierced
stu realizes the sniper now has kelly in his sights
what was that
we must have a bad connection
leave her out of it
i didnt expect her to show up here
but since she has ill improvise
im talking to you again
ill talk all you want
its a bad dye job
the black roots are growing in and it makes her look cheap
ive screwed up her life enough already
please dont hurt her
i dont necessarily have to kill her
i could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation
which part of her displeases you most
if she turns a bit more in profile im accurate enough to remove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose
its just cartilage
any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking better than ever
in the crowd
distant yet distinct amongst the curious onlookers
following her as she forces her way through the crowd toward the police officers
her face virtually fills the screen
production note the only time we deviate from stu and his pov is when we see the snipers own pov through his telescopic sight
you can see her talking to the police now
shes identifying herself as your wife
theyre very interested in who you are
theyre taking her over to see the officer in charge
what was his name
through the cross hairs of the sniperscope we can see kelly conversing with captain ramey
shes in a state of complete agitation
half leaning out of the booth staring at his wife and the cops in the distance
and suddenly we can hear them clearly in spite of the distance
what do you mean psychiatrist
he doesnt see any psychiatrist
then whod your husband be talking to
there was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me
stu seems to be checking things out with this person
he hasnt got many friends i can tell you that
remain here please
we may need you later
you wont hurt him
well do our best not to
kelly is left alone as the captain returns to their command center
kelly is once again a solitary target
she could be picked off without attracting undue attention
she wont even feel it when it happens
take me instead
dont distract me
nows the time to be absolutely still
i have to hold my breath as i squeeze gently no
im hanging up
stu hangs up the receiver
the police as they react
we see a flurry of activity across the street
voices become clear as focus shifts
he hung up
maybe they already traced it
anyhow it doesnt matter
looks like hes coming out
slowly stepping out of the booth
his hands are raised
shouts ive giving myself up
distant first the gun
we want to see you toss away your weapon
distant freeze where you are
turn around and keep those hands clasped
signals the others take him
the swat officers in protective gear now step out of cover and fan out as they approach the booth
hes just outside the booth expecting to feel the snipers bullet go through him at any moment
then the pay phone starts ringing
the sniper is calling back
to the police
all the cops react
particularly the captain and the sergeant
their voices seem close up when they sharpen in focus
what is going on with these fucking phone calls
shouts hold your fire
let him answer it
the swat team backs up but maintain their aim
are you nuts
let them talk
hes not going anywhere
shouts hes going back inside the booth
indeed we see stu re enter the battered phone booth and pick up the receiver
into pay phone yeah
a strange voice begins chattering away in spanish
totally unintelligible to stu
into pay phone you got the wrong number
the voice probably a puerto rican gentleman rattles on in spanish
then the voice on the phone suddenly alters the hispanic accent
it is the now familiar tone of his tormentor
aw relax stu
only yanking your chain
now can we start over
those cops wont wait much longer
what else can they do
they cant afford to just shoot you like i can
not with so much media coverage
not unless you make some stupid aggressive move
beat the abc mobile unit just rolled up
across the street stu can see various tv units from local stations setting up cameras on roofs of trucks
will you look at that
i must be going out over the network
bet theyre pre empting usual programming
and just think if you survive this your trial will be televised
and you can try and make the world believe i ever existed
id be your only defense
how are they gonna prove that i killed anybody when theres no gun
theyll plant one
the police arent above that when theyre desperate to convict
no gun and i walk
dont you think i took that into account
am i a fool
what do you mean
havent i considered every eventuality
i knew theyd come and cordon off the block
beat and that thered have to be a gun someplace
its a small booth stu
have you checked every inch of it
looking up and down its not on the floor
then whats left
why dont you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet and feel around
if they see me reach for something they could open fire
but you have to know if its there
i totally dont give a shit
in a narrow space tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb
you can almost see it outlined if you look closely
stu peers upward at the clouded plastic now stained and dirty
there are shadows of objects above in the shallows area around the light fixture that automatically goes on when the door to the phone booth is tightly closed
stu opens and closes the door a few times watching the light click on watching the shadows around the light
could that be an accumulation of dirt dust or dead insects
or could something be stashed up there
it doesnt matter
i know about ballistics
the slug in that dead guy came from your rifle not any handgun
you saw how hollow points splinter on impact
theres nothing much for ballistics to match to
the same make
calibre bullets are in that handgun
the prosecution rests
theres no gun up there
i dont see a damn thing
slide your finger up under the plastic and youll feel the cold metal surface
there are four rounds left in it
should you decide to shoot your way out
i could never shoot anybody
you could shoot me stu
youd do that in a minute if you could
and id fucking love it
now youre speaking from the heart
come on just lift the partition a few inches and feel whats there for you
im not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon
what about powder residue
how are they going to explain that to a jury
do you think thatll matter with so many eye witnesses
beat do it
or should i re focus my attention on kelly
you carefully distracted me from her before and i let you get away with it
but if youre not going to play fairly a pause there she is again
so close i feel like i could touch her
get off her
then mind me when i speak
im reaching up with my left hand
im pushing against the partition
im feeling around with my fingertips
its filthy up there
feel about inside the shallow space
the shriveled remains of dead flies a layer of dust and then a
im touching something
one of the finest handguns remington makes
lightweight efficient and highly accurate
im not picking it up
not right now
stu lowers his hand still empty
i wouldnt have a chance
i never said you would
im not insane
but youre getting there
it wouldnt take much
that wont happen
you could pull the gun down shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger
thats another option
why would i do that
to please me
and ensure that nothing happens to kelly
i dont necessarily have to deal with her today in the midst of a crowd of cops
i can take her out any time i like
when she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning
what is it a jack russell
i know you can do it
but dont talk about that
id rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police than as a coward who sucked the barrel
im doing your pr for you
creating a final image thatll endure
the outraged new yorker who was pushed too far
when some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory he retaliated
and when the forces of the law closed in he was defiant
to the end
like that nerdy sonofabitch who blew those three wiseass kids away on the subway
nobody minded that he was a sicko
he was living out a new yorkers pet fantasy
can you remember that movie where peter finch started screaming im not taking it anymore
and everybody picked up on it
im mad as hell and im not taking it anymore
that was it
poor finch got himself an oscar for that
but he was dead by then
i mean he really died
maybe playing that part took too much out of him
softly to himself im not taking it anymore
im not taking it anymore
thats the way
psyche yourself up
everybody respects a man who fights back even if he goes a little berserk in the process
thats what its about
we all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his bosses
we all thought of doing that
but only he had the balls
the terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices
maybe somebody will finally get the message
you can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you
im still holding on kelly and she looks very concerned
i could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second
stu is hearing these words but thinking only of what the man on the line has done to him
his turn has come to fight back
he has an idea
if the sniper is focused on kelly he cant be watching stu
turning his back to the police stu slowly sinks to his knees
im on my knees begging you
stand up stu
youre embarrassing yourself
stu now down on his knees in the booth
hes curled up almost into a fetal position
by doing so he hopes to hide the fact that hes reaching into his pants pocket and pulling out his cellular phone
he half expects to hear a shot ring out either from the sniper or the cops
but nothing happens
stu i want you back on your feet facing me
so you can see what im going to do to her
stu ignores the command
hes quickly dialing
hes calling police emergency
stu seen through the cross hairs of the sniperscope crouched doubled up at the foot of the booth
but the cell phone is hidden in front of him
be a man stuart
dont let them see you like this
youre an embarrassment to me
with stu still kneeling
to police across the street as their voices become clear listening to transmission officer on east side of the street reports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket
we better move
hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon
were doing this on fucking tv
the pay phone receiver dangles just above his head
the cellular remains cupped in his hand
stu never lifts the cell phone
he keeps the palm of his hand over the speaker of the phone to muffle any sound from the other end
it rings and finally someone answers
is this an emergency
is someone on the line
but stu addresses himself loudly to the pay phone which he now grips in his other hand
hoping that his words will be picked up by the emergency operator listening via the cellular
to help in this regard he reaches back and slides the door to the booth tightly closed
he pretends to be talking to the sniper but his words are meant for the operator to hear
loud youve made your point
whos going to believe ive got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at th and th
it took you a while to believe it yourself
if youd put a bullet in that captain ramey it wouldve been a different story but you were too wise to do that
why dont you do it for me
wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him
talking loud why me
you could pick off any of those cops from your window up there
like you did that pimp
and that tourist last week
but this time you want me to do your killing for you
and you will
to save kelly
cupped in stus hand and held low
can they hear him on the other end
muffled almost inaudible can you speak up sir
what is your name
stu is concerned that the sniper might hear the voice of the emergency operator
he sets the cell phone down flat on the floor of the booth facing upward
he puts his foot over the receiving end to muffle the incoming voice
then he stands up
thats better stu
now turn around so i can see you
stu talks close into the pay phone receiver now
but keeps his voice raised
its my whole world shrunk down to four feet by three feet
not much bigger than the size of a coffin
they can put handles on the booth and bury you in it
loudly into pay phone when i saw you put that bullet into that black dude i knew youd never let me out of this phone booth alive
youre wasting my time
reach up and take the gun
peering upward squinting let me see you first
what harm can that do you
youre in one of those windows
ive got to know which one
no need for that
being so far i could never identify you
i dont even want to
what is it then
dont worry that id try to point you out
youd shut me up with one of your
calibre hollow points before i could even raise a finger
why does it matter so much
i want to see that you exist
like god exists
its not enough to believe
you want to see him just once even at a distance
and then youd take the gun down
and use it
we have a deal on that
show yourself to me and ill take the gun down
theres a pause as the sniper mulls it over
i dont have to make deals
and youre irritating me by trying to negotiate
god doesnt have to prove anything
he just strikes you down when he gets in the mood
i wont ask to see you anymore
im glad thats settled
but look who else has showed up
i guess she saw the coverage on tv and just couldnt keep away
what are you talking about
the hotel just arrived
and a very beautiful little hotel she is
actually id classify her as more of a motel
i dont see her
shes too far back behind the police line
but ive got a fine shot at her from up here
you dont even know what she looks like
youre in an enviable position now stu
you get to choose between them
tell me which one
which will it be
kelly or mavis
or should i simply select one
lying face up on the floor of the booth
is anybody listening
stu looks down at the cellular
he has no way of knowing if the police operator can hear any of his words
i need time to think
youve got to be more in touch with your feelings
you said you love kelly
then im doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation
it wasnt mavis fault
it was all my fault
then take the third option
reach above you and pick up the gun
youll leave them both alone
there wont be much point in harming them without you around to impress
ill do it
let me see you do it
i need one minute
one last minute please
can you give me that
dont tell me youre going to say your prayers
something like that
assembled on the opposite side of the street
they shouldve traced the fucking call by now
listening on transmitter theres something else coming in
a operator says your name was mentioned by somebody thats still on the line
somebody talking about a phone booth
and a sniper
patch me through
hello this is captain edward ramey
what about that call
the line is still open
its originating from a booth at th and th
can you play me back your recording of the entire call
i cant replay the tape while its still running
then switch to another machine and play back what youve got
its awful faint
hes not talking directly into the receiver
ramey begins to listen
we hear snatches of stus call picking up words which are at times incomprehensible
faint whos going to believe ive got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone booth
the uniformed telephone technician now joins ramey and the sergeant
got what you wanted
the calls coming from up the street
the hotel broadway
have you got the room
its not that easy
to sergeant move your swat units to the hotel
any movement will alert the sniper
if he sees any of us withdraw he may panic
theres another swat unit on the way
divert them to the hotel
send them in from the forty third street side
i dont want any activity the sniper might catch sight of
hes probably high up and facing that booth
hes got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside whoever the hell that poor bastard is
to emergency operator hello operator i missed some of that
run it halfway back and repeat it
like you did that pimp
and that tourist last week
but this time you want me to do the killing for you
hes a dead man
the police seem all excited about something stu
i wasnt looking
i cant wait any longer
say amen then reach up for the gun
when your hand comes down i want to see it
im too afraid
for once be brave
im shaking all over
guys in combat situations even shit their pants
but they follow orders
as soon as the cops see a gun theyll open fire
then id advise you to fire first
stus arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower
his fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that cover the roof of the booth
it raises up easily at the middle where two sheets join
the space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of clouded plastic
we see the fluorescent lighting fixture covered with dust
the solitary object a cruel looking weapon
now stus fingertips protrude into the small space
he touches the gun brushes back and forth feeling the roughness of the grip
as below he continues to hesitate its agony the sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed tightly shut
he can already imagine the police bullets tearing into him
into transmitter give me the word
his arm still raised
he hasnt brought it down with the gun in it
he holds the pay phone receiver jammed up against his mouth
hard parts over
drop your arm and point it like youd point your finger and squeeze
you do it
if you want me dead then fucking murder me
why must i keep invoking some poor girls name every time we come to an impasse
im focused back on kelly again
youre obviously not willing to trade your life for hers
im doing it
he pulls the handgun down into full view
curiously the police do not open fire
you see it
they all see it
he waves the gun so nobody can miss it
where are you
he drops the receiver and steps halfway out of the booth
still the cops do not open fire
then stu starts shooting
not at the police but at the high rise buildings across the street
at the thousands of windows that look down upon him
he gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out in response
he has fired
the remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters
stu tumbles forward sprawling out of the booth onto the pavement
she screams tries to break through but cops restrain her
as it sways back and forth
from it we hear the voice
thanks for such an interesting afternoon
a wooden door being battered open
a few incomprehensible shouts as a swat team dashes in
stus stalling for time has paid off
the police have broken in on stus tormentor and there has been a rapid exchange of shots
a hand reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver
angle widens as ramey places it to his ear
this is captain ramey
somebody talk to me
we took him out captain
nobody else got hurt
whats his condition
the sonofabitch took two
probably wont survive the ride
get a statement from him
ill be right over
he drops the receiver so that it dangles again
camera follows ramey to where stu lies surrounded by cops and medics
hes stunned but very much alive
dont try to sit up
what was that
kneeling rubber bullet
youll have one hell of a nasty welt
maybe a permanent scar there
it couldnt hurt much more if you really shot me
somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us
did you get him
sure as hell did
thanks to you
well be giving him a hypo for the pain
itll put him out for a while
kelly is now brought over by a female cop
she drops to her knees beside stu and tries to embrace him
the medics restrain her
im not really shot
i was so afraid
i thought so too
but were going to be alright
both of us
remember how you swore up and down youd get me on tv
well you did
i already got interviewed on fox and channel eleven and they even want me on a
america tomorrow morning
bet you didnt think i could deliver on that
will you please let go of him miss
a gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance
the medic is about to administer the hypo but stu pushes him away
i want to see him first
the medics are now ready to lift stu onto the gurney and cart him off
but stu struggles against them
the guys dying
thats why ive gotta talk to him
to kelly you can ride with him in the ambulance
the woman cop escorts kelly to the waiting ambulance
ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the swat team inside the hotel
this is ramey
this is ramey
theres nothing but static mixed up feedback and multiple garbled voices on the other end of the line
get everybody off this wavelength
he crosses back to the phone booth picks up the dangling receiver
yeah its ramey again
can you hold the phone close enough so the perp can listen
hes not saying a word captain
hes not about to talk to us
maybe to him
ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift stu onto the gurney
stand him up
to stu can you stand
i can try
help him over here
the medics support stu and inch him back to the booth
its painful but stu ignores it
ramey holds the phone up so stu can both listen and speak
into pay phone its me
do you hear me
wheezing had to have the last word stu
i finally beat your ass
admit it you fuck
but youll never forget me
i gave you the most thrilling day of your life
now youre gonna die you bastard
i lost a lot of blood
dont you want to donate some for me
then wed really be part of each other
i cant wait to see you at the hospital
so i can yank your fucking air tube out
wish i could give you that pleasure
you deserve it
coughing only im out of time
whats your name
at least tell me who you are
theres more violent coughing then silence
then a cops voice is heard
stu stares at the receiver
well find out who he is
and why he picked you
a beat what do you want to bet you wont
stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver
ill spend my whole life trying to figure that out
then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto the waiting gurney
the hypo is finally administered
it kicks in immediately relieving the pain
hes wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance
kelly is already inside waiting to accompany stu to the hospital
pulling away in low angle
camera slides back inside the ambulance with stu
the doors shut obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his entire world until moments ago
groggy gotta sleep now
no phone calls
kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs
stu passes out into a deep sleep he much deserves
