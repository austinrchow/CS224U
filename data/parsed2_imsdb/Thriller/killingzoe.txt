written by roger avary rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the charles de gualle airport
aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab we hear the sounds of the airport the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in french that loitering is
not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed the honking of the horns from other automobiles the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings
inside the cab playing on the radio is angelique kidjos funky song batonga
then the rear door to the cab opens and in an extreme close up we see zed a young man with wild almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses
and with a head of nappy red hair
his face has drops on it from the flurry outside
he settles himself then looks to the cab driver an easy going senegalese frenchman in the front seat
he starts driving
avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un moment
lautoroute est ferme
a cause du juillet
he drives for a while
do you mind the radio
zed looks at the meter francs are clicking away
he also looks at the cab drivers license his name is moises du bois
do you want me to turn the radio off
realizing hes being asked a question i dont speak french
the driver turns around
in broken english ah
thats good because i speak a little english
i asked if you mind the radio
zed shakes his head no
with a smile super cool
zed adjusts his watch
what time is it
time time time
i dont know
zed forgets the adjustment for now
are you in town for business
its a nice hotel
very big rooms
he looks at zed in the rear view mirror
do you know paris
ive been here once before
when i was younger
the cab driver smiles
those were the days
they drive for a while
i beg your pardon
do you have a wife
then after thinking about it for a while why
well if you need a wife for the night
searching for the right words in french une escorte
pour vous faire visiter
then back to his broken english for business
i give you my number
very nice girl
like when you were young
he lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger tightly extended together then he crosses them
know what i mean
zed smiles at this and nods
speaks the language of love
take you to heaven and back
you just tell me and i set it up
zed shakes his head and laughs
what you laughing at
you let moises set it up
she treat you right
she treat you fine
zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it
a long empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel
from around a corner comes a bellboy carrying zeds one bag
zed is right behind him
they come up to room a and the bellboy unlocks the door
the door to the room opens and the bellboy followed by zed walks into the room
he puts zeds bag onto one of those luggage holders and proceeds to show him the room
sitting on the bed is a large air freight package
in broken english your package
it arrived in the last night of before last night
he points to the telephone
telephone for the room service
he motions toward the bathroom
he opens the closet door
to hang the clothes
he points to a control console next to the bed
from here you can operate the television
then he pauses at the door before he goes out
zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some french money he starts fingering through it
then the bellboy takes the liberty of showing zed which bills to give him
after getting what he wanted merci
he starts to leave
the bellboy turns around
what time is it
confused what time is it
pointing at his watch time
il est presque huit heures moins dix
the bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door
zed looks around the room still wondering what time it is and takes a seat on the bed
obviously tired from the flight zed unbuttons his shirt a bit and lays back on the bed next to the package
before he dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on the bedside table
he is asleep
zeds bed while still made looks like its been slept in
sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package
inside of it is a black steel briefcase
the shower is on and from the look of things zed is in it
on the bedside table we see zeds watch
it reads p
next to it is the phone
next to the phone is a piece of folded paper with moises name and a phone number that reads
zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his face and cascade down his body
he opens his mouth and freely drinks the water then he spits some out with a spurt
then he stops attentive listening for something
he turns the shower off
then he hears it again the knocking on the door
zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower
he makes his way toward the knocking
zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped around his waist
he opens it
in the hall is zoey a cute french girl of not more than twenty
shes chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might but she looks like no girl zed ever went to school with
a little awkwardly bonjour
zed opens up the door and lets her in
she checks out the room and places her bag on the bed
then she makes her way to the window for a view of the city
vous avez une belle chambre
je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel
she turns to him but in the process takes the time to examine every detail of the room
ca sera francs de lheure
toute la nuit pour
et faudra porter un i
dont speak french
she blows a bubble
she takes a seat on the bed
it will be one thousand francs for all night
zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her
we can do it now if you want
well let me just dry up
okay but its not necessary
he goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself
she puts the money in her bag and then turns on the television from the remote console
a french talk show comes on
she changes the channel until she comes to a station playing f
murnaus silent classic nosferatu
she smiles and sits back to watch
from the bathroom whats your name
zoe or zoey
which ever you like
my names zed
smiling at this thats funny
we both have z names
zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair
his pants are on
what was that
she notices his pants
you can take those off
id rather watch you get undressed first
matter of factly alright
she stands up and starts to lift her top off
he stops her
he lays down on the bed
she stands there looking at him and then smiles
alright mister america
then with zed laying on the bed and watching her she slowly seductively strips in front of him never taking her eyes from his eyes until she is totally naked
slow enough for you
then like a cat prowling for its prey she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants
she removes the pants and climbs on top of him
they begin to make love
on the television nosferatu silently plays
zoey and zed quicken their pace with an urgency one cant resist during a moment of passion
she cries out and lowers herself to his grasp
an image overcomes her mind
they quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire both satisfied
she begins to kiss him multiple times over the face
she rolls over still hugging him purring like a kitten
they rest there for a while
holding each other
she takes the covers and crawls under them so does zed
moises told me you were in town for business
what kind of business
i dont know
im just curious
do you ask all your clients questions
just the ones i like
so you like me
a good person
i run into some real creeps
how do you know im a good person
we fit together
all men and women fit together
hell even some men fit together
no but you know we clicked
you made me orgasm
do you know how often i orgasm with a man moises sets me up with
no i dont
theyre almost always fat like pigs
zed laughs at this
and you make me feel safe
thats something more important than the orgasm
an integral part maybe of the orgasm
i never really thought of it like that
well its true
zed nods at this
turn off the television
zed reaches over and turns it off from the console
so i mean it when i tell you zed i like you very much
well i like you too zoe
for the same reason
any man can orgasm
even with his own hand
zed stares ahead as he thinks of an answer
well i like your honesty
unlike most prostitutes ive been with
she doesnt like the sound of this
she slaps him
i am not a prostitute
zed is a little surprised at this
can i have my francs back then
im a student
and to pay for the classes i became an escort
its my choice to sleep with you
you dont understand
no i do
hey its not easy
i didnt say it was
im here because i want to
okay okay relax
what school do you go to
the centre du art paris
thats really interesting
what kind of art do you study
not any of the old shit
i have a day job too
three times a week
she rolls onto her back and stares into an imaginary world as she talks to zed
but someday there will be only my art
what kind of things do you paint
i dont paint
i make things
not like sculpture
but with no narrative
i want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world
void of feeling emotion
void of destiny
those are left for me
they belong only to me
if someone else can see into it
then it is no longer mine
i have failed
and i would destroy it
i dont care how much cash they would offer me
it would be shit
i cant tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed
they told too much about me
and if someone wants to know something about me
ill tell them myself
the way im telling you
she looks back at him
what i do i do only for the objects
id like to see one of these
so you could see the work of a whore
he decides to put a stop to this once and for all
im sorry for calling you a prostitute
i didnt understand the difference
the difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm
he gives her a kiss
if these things you make are as true as you are
im sure theyre as indescribable
perhaps someday youll make one
if i do
youll never know which one it is
because ill be the only one who understands
ill be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from
zed is unable to speak
they look into each others eyes for a long moment hearing the sounds of the city drift in through the window
then she leans forward and gives him a soft understanding kiss
zed is asleep
zoey is asleep in his arms
there is a knocking at the door
zed opens his eyes
the knock becomes a pound
zed gets up and puts on his pants
zoey gets up and looks around
groggily what time is it
i have no idea
there is more pounding on the door
im going to take a shower
she trots off naked to the bathroom and starts the shower
zed walks over to the door and opens it up
standing in the hall is eric a frenchman of zeds age wearing baggy french style clothes
with a thick accent hey you madman
zeds happy to see him
what happened to you
i thought you were going to call
eric walks in and starts to notice the traces of wild love making around the room
smiling oh i see
you have been busy
sorry i asked the hotel to give me a wake up call
thats good but now i am here
so lets go
we have a lot to talk about
what about the girl
is she your girlfriend
he peeks into the bathroom
shes a dishrag whore
kick her out
ill let her stay here tonight
dont be silly
eric walks into the bathroom
eric walks up to the shower and knocks on the door
zoey is obviously surprised to see him
in french with english subtitles okay
get out of the shower
its time for you to leave
eric opens up the door and yanks her out of the shower
come on you fucking slut
let go of me you shit
he drags her out into the room she is dripping wet
zed cant believe this
to zed dont worry about her
to zoey in french why dont you just go back to your pimp and suck his black dick
she bites his hand
he yells in pain
god damn it
he kicks her in the butt and sends her toward the door
get the fuck out of here you fucking whore
he opens the door and throws her into the hall
naked zoey falls into the hall
eric slams the door shut
she is instantly back on her feet and screaming as she pounds on the door
give me my clothes you asshole
she is pounding on the door
looking at his hand wound god damn it
look at my hand
shocked at the whole incident jesus eric
je veux mes habits
he picks up her clothes and her bag opens the door and throws it into the hall just long enough for her to yell at him
almost too quick to understand tu te prends pour qui espece de connard
he slams the door shut
then he turns to zed
so tell me what have you been up to
zed sits down on the bed
allez vous faire enculer tous le deux
eric i liked that girl
well then why didnt you stop me
because you were on a rampage
look your whole life youve done nothing but fuck whores
a girl like that will give you aids
why dont you find a nice girl in the suburbs
because when you need to get off you dont want to have to date for months to do it
just use your hand like me
sometimes you just need honesty
i dont understand
anyway its too late
get dressed lets go out and meet the boys
okay let me take a shower
no in paris its good to smell like youve been fucking
it will make them respect you
just put on a shirt and a sport coat
zed starts to get dressed the mcdonalds on the corner of boulevard saint michel and rue soufflot is bustling
erics citroen screeches around the corner on its way past the pantheon and into the heart of the fifth arrondissment
eric and zed are driving through the streets of paris in erics car
the grooving ryuichi sakamoto song triste is playing on the radio
im glad you came
how long has it been
its amazing you know
here you are
one day in america
well to be honest there really wasnt much happening for me in the states
but in paris your old friend eric has a job for you so you came
how could i resist your invitation
you would have been stupid to
so what have you been doing here
after school i spent some time in algeria studying african philosophy
and then i bummed around
for a while i worked at le figaro
with an assumed masters degree
and lately we have just been bombing fascists here in paris
you know like terrorists
zed looks over at him
eric and zed walk up the stairs to the fifth floor where erics flat is
on the top landing there is a dead cat laying
zed and eric notice the cat as eric is opening the door
there is also a telephone coming out of the neighbors door
the people next door are on holiday
we took their phone
if you want to make a long distance call go ahead
is that cat dead
i dont know
i think its asleep but its been there for days
eric gives it a kick
i guess it is dead
they walk into the flat
erics flat consists of a good sized living room area with a connected kitchen and a small bedroom in the back
in the front of the living room there is a small balcony where the sounds of the city pour in
the room itself is a general mess
a bunch of guns are piled in one corner of the floor
hung up on the wall is a huge french dressed to kill poster
some brazilian gilberto getz music is playing
sitting at the table playing cards are three men francois ricardo and jean
sitting on the couch rolling a cigarette with hash is claude and oliver
they all turn as zed and eric walk in
they all return the greeting
to zed okay
this is francois ricardo jean oliver and claude
they all know who you are
to the rest of them ne soyez pa salauds
offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres
oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen
with an english accent zed would you like a beer
dont think of it
to zed come
the kitchen is an absolute pig stye
dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter
oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it
he scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass
zed takes a seat on the couch next to claude
suddenly a spider monkey dressed in a little uncle sam costume comes screeching up onto zeds lap and then up onto his head the whole time clawing at his eyes
eric amused turns from the men playing cards and smiles
to zed easy
dont scare him
he just wants to claim you
zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto claudes shoulder
let me introduce you properly
this is enrique
the monkey screeches
he likes to be called chim chim but we dont always get what we like
again the hideous creature screeches
to enrique tais toi
then to zed do you like hash
then eric interrupts
jokingly dont sit next to that junkie
claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks
to claude that little shit monkey of yours pissed on my billy holiday albums
next time hes out the door
to zed zed come here
zed gets up and goes with eric to the bedroom
on the way oliver hands him the glass of beer
here you go mate
oliver sits down next to claude
erics bed has probably never been made
in fact this room looks a lot like quentin tarantinos old apartment
but there is a certain order to all this chaos
eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed
dont ask me where we got this
on bastille day all the banks are closed
he places his hand on the blueprint
but this one
the banque internationale de paris
and for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next bastille day
we will go in and shut the bank down
now look at this
eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic
as you can see only one person can start the alarm
he hands it to zed the concierge at this desk
he points it out on the blueprint we will take care of him
then we can close the bank
no one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed
turning the schematic around are you sure he wont push the alarm
hes right next to the door
wed have to be totally incompetent not to stop him
dont worry about that
he points to the main floor vault
this is where they keep the days reserve cash
okay fuck that
he flips the page to the lower level blueprint
there are many vaults downstairs but this is the vault we must get into
this is where the real prize is
what kind of vault is that
he checks the blueprint
he thinks about it itll take three hours
no thats too long
thats how long itll take
its too long
we have to be in and out
he snaps his fingers like that
or there will be suspicion
a little time is okay
but too long and
he shrugs his shoulders in an i dont know gesture
well hold on a second
pointing to the blueprint whats this
eric looks down at the blueprint
there is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault
eric looks closely at the blueprint
i dont know
it connects the two vaults
well what kind of vault is this other one
reading the blueprint also swiss but this one is a poseidon
why would those two vaults be connected
i dont know
because i can get into this vault in half an hour
but this entry way is too small to get the platen out
we have a lot of merchandise in there
no dont you see
we get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault
from the inside i could open the caliber vault in five minutes
you could open it in five minutes
from the inside its easy
excited hot damn
that is our answer
when is bastille day
were doing this tomorrow
but of course
its not impossible
everyone knows what to do
i dont know what to do
you dont need to know shit
just get into the vault and well do the rest
i havent even seen the bank
fuck the bank
before we do a job we live life
its better that way
now we do heroin
extreme close on eric making heroin
the heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it then a little bit of tap water
huddled around eric are francois ricardo and oliver
so high hes wobbling you have to look at the starship enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain
no one is really listening to oliver
eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil
continuing spock is the right hemisphere of the brain all logic and intellect
mc coy is the left hemisphere stricktly emotional
and kirk is the unseen observer
he drifts between the two
back and forth as it might be caught between the two thought processes
ricardo hands him a cotton ball
continuing its really quite brilliant you know
thats why star trek is and always will be a hit show
eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture
to oliver here shut up and hold this
he hands oliver the spoon and takes out a needle
using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe
then he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it
dont want to get air bubbles in my veins
they all laugh at this
in the meantime zed is sitting on the couch with claude and jean
claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette
jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture
do you want heroin
no i want to be sharp for tomorrow
jean and claude laugh at this
a little bit of heroin some hash a beer
and youre just right
jean snorts a line
claude offers zed the spliff
zed shakes his head no
recovering from the snort thats good
eric francois ricardo and oliver come out of the kitchen laughing
eric ricardo and oliver take a seat on the couch opposite zed
francois sits on the floor
eric rolls up his sleeve
to ricardo in french hold my arm
then to zed my vein is like a rock
ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes
eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood
it mixes with the heroin then he pumps it in
then back into the syringe then all the way back in
he withdraws the needle
ricardo lets go of his arm
eric is in bliss
his eyes roll back into his head
he looks like hes on the verge of falling asleep
then jean takes another snort
pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high shooting up and drinking more beer
then jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it
to zed try some
its called chasing the dragon
the chinese have been doing it for centuries
i dont think so
oh but you must
it will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that youre rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper
they stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face
they then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter
before zed knows it hes inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke
suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we
ricardo is racing erics car through the streets of paris weaving in and out of traffic
next to him is oliver and in the back seat is zed and eric
theyre giving the very stoned zed a whirlwind tour of the sights
a car speeds up next to them
in it is francois and claude with jean driving
they are racing with ricardo through the streets
the patrick hernandez song born to be alive is blasting away on the radio
thats notre dame
but before zed can even look it has past by
do you like french cars
all zed can notice is that the speedometer is at kilometers per hour
he tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour
answering enriques question yes
i like the cadillac
fifty two to seventy five
up here you can see the eiffel tower
zed is in too much of a blur
he leans over to eric
is tomorrow really bastille day
yes tomorrow we pull the biggest job in french history
and spend the rest of our lives in monte carlo
the drunken englishman oliver belches and then cheers
the two cars are franticly racing through traffic
jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is theyre going to
claude in the seat next to him gives him some advice
lets beat them
francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke
jeans car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off ricardo
ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to eric
to ricardo watch it
dont crash my car
eric takes a big hit
over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves
do you see
no zed doesnt see
suddenly everyone in the car is shouting out the windows
out the window fucking fags
also out the window suce ma bite
into zeds ear this is good to have you here
we could not do this without you
everyone has agreed to give you double shares
zed nods delirious
you know i have aids
from the needle
zed cant believe this
hes not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard
then eric sees something
okay up here is the arc de triomphe
they take a sharp turn
eric zed francois ricardo jean claude and oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar
somewhere crazy raymond scott toy jazz music is playing
an old wine cellar has been converted into a toy jazz club
dirt floors chairs and small tables scattered about
but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics
a band is playing away
in the audience sit about twelve french people all enjoying the music
in the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it
behind the tables are two rotund but happy french women mirelle and eric zed francois ricardo jean claude and oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in french to
mirelle and josephine
eric hands them some money
everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club
oliver sits next to zed
so how long have you known eric
well erics mother is american
yeah and his dads french
and she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up
so every six months he would come back to the states
we were best friends
eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here
well its good to have you here
eric speaks fairly highly of you
say he says youre a big fan of viking films
i used to be when i was young
oh theyre the best
helmets with horns on them
thats fucking genius
he starts laughing
how bout toy jazz
you like it
zed watches the players on stage and then nods
i love it
its really good you know
like real music
it has a heart and culture all its own
its like jazz for dwarves
or guys in leiderhosen
total purity of essence
hungry cannibalsd like it
then claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine
here you must drink some of this wine its good
he pours zed a glass
oliver passes on the wine
to claude non merci cest de la merde
to oliver la ferme
cest du bon vin
to zed the fucking english
zed sips some
hes in no real shape to tell if the wines good or not
suddenly it seems as though the bands music gets louder
the horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music
the band stands up
the people watching start to dance if not in their seats then right in front of everything
suddenly zed notices something
eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band
zed blinks but its true
oliver and claude start laughing
look at him
and surely he must be yet in a strange way hes keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good
eric is all smile as he plays with them
sweat is running down his face but hes caught up in the moment
elise a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage caught up in erics frenzy and is dancing about like james brown
then the music crescendos and eric hands the trombone back to a musician
the set is over
eric skips off the stage and walks over to where oliver claude and zed are sitting
the mcdonalds on the corner of boulevard saint michel and rue soufflot is bustling
erics citroen screeches around the corner on its way past the pantheon and into the heart of the fifth arrondissment
eric and zed are driving through the streets of paris in erics car
the grooving ryuichi sakamoto song triste is playing on the radio

okay fuck that
he flips the page to the lower level blueprint
there are many vaults downstairs but this is the vault we must get into
this is where the real prize is
what kind of vault is that
he checks the blueprint
he thinks about it itll take three hours
no thats too long
thats how long itll take
its too long
we have to be in and out
he snaps his fingers like that
or there will be suspicion
a little time is okay
but too long and
he shrugs his shoulders in an i dont know gesture
well hold on a second
pointing to the blueprint whats this
eric looks down at the blueprint
there is a small passage connecting the main vault to an adjacent vault
eric looks closely at the blueprint
i dont know
it connects the two vaults
well what kind of vault is this other one
reading the blueprint also swiss but this one is a poseidon
why would those two vaults be connected
i dont know
because i can get into this vault in half an hour
but this entry way is too small to get the platen out
we have a lot of merchandise in there
no dont you see
we get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault
from the inside i could open the caliber vault in five minutes
you could open it in five minutes
from the inside its easy
excited hot damn
that is our answer
when is bastille day
were doing this tomorrow
but of course
its not impossible
everyone knows what to do
i dont know what to do
you dont need to know shit
just get into the vault and well do the rest
i havent even seen the bank
fuck the bank
before we do a job we live life
its better that way
now we do heroin
extreme close on eric making heroin
the heroin powder is put into a spoon with some lemon squeezed into it then a little bit of tap water
huddled around eric are francois ricardo and oliver
so high hes wobbling you have to look at the starship enterprise as a metaphor for the human brain
no one is really listening to oliver
eric takes out a lighter and cooks it to a boil
continuing spock is the right hemisphere of the brain all logic and intellect
mc coy is the left hemisphere stricktly emotional
and kirk is the unseen observer
he drifts between the two
back and forth as it might be caught between the two thought processes
ricardo hands him a cotton ball
continuing its really quite brilliant you know
thats why star trek is and always will be a hit show
eric places the cotton ball in the spoon with the mixture
to oliver here shut up and hold this
he hands oliver the spoon and takes out a needle
using the cotton as a filter he draws the heroin into the syringe
then he holds the syringe up and starts tapping it
dont want to get air bubbles in my veins
they all laugh at this
in the meantime zed is sitting on the couch with claude and jean
claude is rolling a hash and tobacco cigarette
jean is chopping up some powder heroin on the glass of a small picture
do you want heroin
no i want to be sharp for tomorrow
jean and claude laugh at this
a little bit of heroin some hash a beer
and youre just right
jean snorts a line
claude offers zed the spliff
zed shakes his head no
recovering from the snort thats good
eric francois ricardo and oliver come out of the kitchen laughing
eric ricardo and oliver take a seat on the couch opposite zed
francois sits on the floor
eric rolls up his sleeve
to ricardo in french hold my arm
then to zed my vein is like a rock
ricardo takes hold of his arm and squeezes
eric inserts the needle into his vein and draws out a little blood
it mixes with the heroin then he pumps it in
then back into the syringe then all the way back in
he withdraws the needle
ricardo lets go of his arm
eric is in bliss
his eyes roll back into his head
he looks like hes on the verge of falling asleep
then jean takes another snort
pretty soon everyone is smoking and getting high shooting up and drinking more beer
then jean holds out a piece of folded aluminum foil with some heroin in it
to zed try some
its called chasing the dragon
the chinese have been doing it for centuries
i dont think so
oh but you must
it will make you feel as though the rest of the world is in a bubble of glass and that youre rubbing up against it like a bad windshield wiper
they stick the aluminum foil with the heroin in it up next to his face
they then light the bottom of the foil with a lighter
before zed knows it hes inhaling a silky ribbon of smoke
suddenly our plane of focus wildly shifts and we
ricardo is racing erics car through the streets of paris weaving in and out of traffic
next to him is oliver and in the back seat is zed and eric
theyre giving the very stoned zed a whirlwind tour of the sights
a car speeds up next to them
in it is francois and claude with jean driving
they are racing with ricardo through the streets
the patrick hernandez song born to be alive is blasting away on the radio
thats notre dame
but before zed can even look it has past by
do you like french cars
all zed can notice is that the speedometer is at kilometers per hour
he tries to calculate what that is in miles per hour
answering enriques question yes
i like the cadillac
fifty two to seventy five
up here you can see the eiffel tower
zed is in too much of a blur
he leans over to eric
is tomorrow really bastille day
yes tomorrow we pull the biggest job in french history
and spend the rest of our lives in monte carlo
the drunken englishman oliver belches and then cheers
the two cars are franticly racing through traffic
jean is very intent on beating them to whatever location it is theyre going to
claude in the seat next to him gives him some advice
lets beat them
francois laughs and coughs out a cloud of smoke
jeans car makes a dangerous lane change across traffic and cuts off ricardo
ricardo swerves as he passes a joint to eric
to ricardo watch it
dont crash my car
eric takes a big hit
over here is where the male prostitutes sell themselves
do you see
no zed doesnt see
suddenly everyone in the car is shouting out the windows
out the window fucking fags
also out the window suce ma bite
into zeds ear this is good to have you here
we could not do this without you
everyone has agreed to give you double shares
zed nods delirious
you know i have aids
from the needle
zed cant believe this
hes not sure if what he heard was what he thought he heard
then eric sees something
okay up here is the arc de triomphe
they take a sharp turn
eric zed francois ricardo jean claude and oliver are all walking down some dank stone steps into a cellar
somewhere crazy raymond scott toy jazz music is playing
an old wine cellar has been converted into a toy jazz club
dirt floors chairs and small tables scattered about
but the arched brick ceilings make for great acoustics
a band is playing away
in the audience sit about twelve french people all enjoying the music
in the back of the club near the doors some tables have been set up with a buffet of local cuisine on it
behind the tables are two rotund but happy french women mirelle and eric zed francois ricardo jean claude and oliver walk in and immediately start blabbing away in french to
mirelle and josephine
eric hands them some money
everyone enters and takes seats at various parts of the club
oliver sits next to zed
so how long have you known eric
well erics mother is american
yeah and his dads french
and she and his father had some kind of six month split plan set up
so every six months he would come back to the states
we were best friends
eventually he and his mother had a falling out and he stayed here
well its good to have you here
eric speaks fairly highly of you
say he says youre a big fan of viking films
i used to be when i was young
oh theyre the best
helmets with horns on them
thats fucking genius
he starts laughing
how bout toy jazz
you like it
zed watches the players on stage and then nods
i love it
its really good you know
like real music
it has a heart and culture all its own
its like jazz for dwarves
or guys in leiderhosen
total purity of essence
hungry cannibalsd like it
then claude comes up to them with some glasses and a bottle of red wine
here you must drink some of this wine its good
he pours zed a glass
oliver passes on the wine
to claude non merci cest de la merde
to oliver la ferme
cest du bon vin
to zed the fucking english
zed sips some
hes in no real shape to tell if the wines good or not
suddenly it seems as though the bands music gets louder
the horns really start to scream and the room becomes a delirium of music
the band stands up
the people watching start to dance if not in their seats then right in front of everything
suddenly zed notices something
eric is up on stage playing a trombone right alongside the band
zed blinks but its true
oliver and claude start laughing
look at him
and surely he must be yet in a strange way hes keeping up with the other musicians and sounding pretty good
eric is all smile as he plays with them
sweat is running down his face but hes caught up in the moment
elise a woman from the audience has jumped up onto the stage caught up in erics frenzy and is dancing about like james brown
then the music crescendos and eric hands the trombone back to a musician
the set is over
eric skips off the stage and walks over to where oliver claude and zed are sitting
extreme close on the door to the bank
francois puts a sign on the door that reads closed for bastille day
the sub lobby teller and the sub lobby guard rendezvous with the sub lobby assistant
to assistant do the phones work
they went dead
they walk out into the sub lobby
the sub level teller and the sub lobby assistant walk into the sub lobby just as eric zed oliver and the bank manager start coming down the stairs
at the sight of eric and his men the sub lobby guard aims his weapon but does not fire because of the bank manager
eric presses his uzi against the bank managers neck
to the guard drop the gun
drop your gun now and nobody dies
after a moments thought about this and the fact that oliver has a sawed off aimed at him he slowly puts his gun on the floor
they descend down the stairs into the sub lobby
oliver takes his gun
francois ricardo and jean have finished herding everyone behind the teller windows
claude is on his way downstairs
im going to check things out downstairs
to the people now
on the ground
then for effect he kicks a man
claude comes downstairs with his gun raised
all clear down here
take these two upstairs
and chain the gate to the sub lobby shut
oliver pushes the sub lobby guard and the sub lobby assistant toward claude
then he hands him a chain
claude can barely maintain his enthusiasm
the phones and video are down
were locked up tight
then in english we fucking did it
he takes the two upstairs
eric smiles through his teeth at the bank manager
any others i should worry about
to oliver well just to be sure then from one of the safety deposit booths a sound is heard
all eyes turn to it
oliver walks up to it and kicks the door in
the stodgy customer is kneeling in it
he instantly holds his hands high
eric walks up gun in hand
who the fuck are you
please dont shoot me
on the ground
to the bank manager making a deposit i hope
he smiles to oliver bring him with us
they all make their way down through the sub lobby hall
theyre herding the men through the hall
to the sub lobby teller vault locked
shut your fucking mouths
to eric the vault doors are shut and time locked
you wont be able to open them
they walk through a doorway into the storage elevator area
eric pushes the manager and the others through the doorway
to the bank manager you think were fucking amateurs
you think were stupid
ive got news for you
we planned ahead my friend
eric pushes them infront of the calibre vault door
now save us a lot of time and just open the vault
he releases the bank manager and stuffs the barrel of his handgun into the sub level tellers mouth
open the vault
the tellers eyes widen
to the teller can you
once closed only i can open it
then open it
the sub lobby tellers eyes plead with the bank manager
zed is watching the whole affair nervously
do you understand that ill kill her if you dont open this fucking vault
do you understand that this is an international reserve bank
robbing it is punishable by life imprisonment
the back of the sub lobby tellers head paints the wall red
jesus fucking christ
the bank manager shocked as he is looks at zed
he knows hes an american
the sub lobby tellers body slumps to the ground
eric grabs the stodgy customer and puts the gun to his temple
open the vault door or ill kill this man next
the bank manager is freaking out but after what was probably the most horribly agonizing internal debate he holds his ground
i still cannot open the vault
its only things in there
this man is flesh and blood
i will not open the vault
i can open the vault
shut the fuck up
then to the stodgy customer youre a customer in this bank and this is how they treat you
do you have a family
he nods his head yes
would you like to see them again
he nods his head again
to the manager this man has a family he would like to have bastille day dinner with tonight
so save us some time and open the vault
after losing about a pound of sweat
eric quickly removes the gun from the customers temple and fires two shots into the bank managers face
the bank manager falls against the vault door and onto the floor
then to the stodgy customer you seem like a nice man
tonight at dinner think about how lucky you are and how much you love your family
he starts nodding his head
to oliver take him upstairs
oliver takes the customer upstairs to the rest of the people
eric rips off his mask
dont you ever conflict with me during work again
do you hear
zed off his clown mask
you didnt have to shoot any of them
patronizing oh im sorry
i didnt realize you were in charge now
nobody told me
his temper flares if he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour
he charges into the reserve vault area
they enter and eric walks up to a bathroom door
its just that weve gone from being thieves to murderers
oh fuck it doesnt matter
here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank
i thought the death penalty was abolished in
thats what they tell you
but who cares
i need to take a piss
eric enters the bathroom
on his way into the bathroom why dont you open the vault
zed looks at the bathroom door close
after a fuming pause he turns and walks back toward the poseidon vault door
francois peeks through the venetian blinds of the windows to the outside
in the meantime behind the teller windows guarding the people who are laying on the floor jean and ricardo are in the middle of a conversation
oliver is sitting on the counter having just brought the stodgy customer upstairs
also here now are the sub lobby assistant and the sub lobby guard
what do you mean youre not sure if the alarm went off or not
i mean im not sure
well either it did or it didnt
and im not sure
well do you think it did
i just fucking told you i dont know
take a guess
its just a guess
well what kind of a fucking guess is that
youre saying it could have
well thats fucking great
why didnt you just kill that asshole to begin with
i knew i should have been the one to kill him
youre always so damn slow
shit these masks are really hot
i know ive got fucking sweat stinging my eyes
in the meantime zoey is on the floor unsure of what is going on
zed opens up his steel briefcase
inside of it are all sorts of electronic gear and tools
he takes out a tape measure and some callipers and measures out a point on the vault door
he marks the point with a piece of chalk
in one of the stalls eric is preparing a syringe
he has just cooked the heroin and is now tapping on it to get the bubbles out
zed takes a power drill out from the briefcase and attaches a special diamond tipped bit
he measures the depth he wants to drill to and then marks the bit with a yellow pencil
he places his ear to the vault and taps the spot
eric readies the needle and slaps his vein
he is shaking but trying to remain as still as possible
he places the needle at the end of a track on his arm and inserts it
zed starts drilling into the point he marked with the chalk on the vault door
erics eyes roll back into his head as the heroin fills his vein
he drops the needle to the floor and sits back to enjoy the rush
zoey is sitting on the floor next to the other bank hostages
extreme close on zeds drill bit
it burrows into the steel wall of the safe spewing out spiral shavings
zoey looks at all the people sitting around her
theyre all scared
jean ricardo and francois are talking amongst themselves
in french to ricardo do you know one
an unfortunate fellow was locked up in prison doing five to ten for armed robbery
all he could think of the whole time was eating pussy
zoey looks up at them telling the joke
the day finally came for his release
he walked out of the prison with a new suit and fifty francs the officials had given him and made a bee line for the whorehouse in the nearest town
slamming his fifty francs on the front desk he said i wanna eat some pussy
jean is already laughing
im not done
whereve you been said the greasy fellow behind the desk fifty francs wont get you a close look these days
zoey glances at all of the people
then her eyes lock with the concierge security guard
listen buddy said the ex convict pulling him out of his chair by the shirt collar i wanna eat some pussy and i want it now
the concierge security guard lifts his pant leg slowly
okay okay gasped the proprietor ill see what i can do
so the ex con followed him through to the very back of the warehouse through some stained tattered red curtains and into a grimy little room where a bedraggled looking
whore lay spreadeagled on a filthy bed
shes yours for fifty francs said the proprietor and the fellow went at it
zoey notices that on the concierge security guards leg is an ankle holster with a small
pistol on it
his fingers begin to unsnap the safety harness on it
her eyes widen
after a little while he came across a piece of egg
thats funny he thought to himself i dont think i had egg for breakfast
but he spat it out and kept eating away
next he found a piece of chipped beef wedged between his front teeth
im sure i havent eaten chipped beef this week he thought but kept on
then he came across the corn
what is this
he said i think im going to be sick
the concierge security guard unsnaps the safety
zoey knows hes going to make his move
ya know says the whore thats what the last guy said
before they can even laugh the concierge security guard whips out the
and fires three shots
two of them hit ricardo in the chest
he falls to the ground
the other hits francois in the arm
in an instant jean is firing his machine gun into the group of people huddled on the floor
everyone is screaming and trying to get away
machine gun fire cuts through the concierge security guard killing him dead
unfortunately the wild spray of bullets also rips into three of the tellers four of the customers and the loan officer killing them all
people are trying to flee but claude fires his gun into the ceiling
no one fucking moves
jean has jumped up on the table and is aiming at the people
zed looks up hearing the commotion
eric comes running out of the bathroom and into the storage elevator area
what is it
whats going on
zed gets up to go upstairs
i dont know
you stay here
eric runs upstairs
francois is on the ground holding his arm
he keeps rolling back and forth in pain
ricardo is dead
jean claude and oliver are waving their guns around ready to kill someone any second
nobody fucking moves
nobody fucking moves
claude motions to the dead security guard
somebody get it
oliver goes over to the dead security guard the whole time waving his gun at people
dont fuck with me
dont fuck with me
he grabs the gun from the dead security guards limp grip
eric storms in
he isnt wearing his mask
what the fuck is going on
zoey notices eric she remembers him
pointing at the dead man this crazy fuck shot ricardo
eric looks over at ricardo and then at the carnage
then everybody notices he isnt wearing a mask
quietly eric your mask
then oliver yanks his off
who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway
i cant see a fucking think in this
everyone takes their masks off
is this what happens
is this what happens when i walk away for five minutes
he had a hidden gun
mimicking a little child he had a hidden gun
then back to normal i dont care
then one of the bank customers a male tourist speaks up
holding up his passport this is insane
i am a u
you must let me go
eric looks at him
im an american
im just here exchanging dollars
if it wasnt for my country youd all be speaking german
eric is tired of this outburst he shoots him
to the people i have had enough of this nonsense
the next person that speaks will die
everyone is quiet
francois is sitting on the floor bleeding from his arm
eric im sorry
things got out of hand
but were in control now
lets try to keep it that way
god what a mess
eric what the fuck is it now
you want me to hold your hand as you take a piss
i have a question
do we know if the alarm went off or not
it didnt go off
if it had the police would be here and our whole plan would be fucked
but theyre not here and our plan isnt fucked
so if there arent any more fucking stupid questions ill go downstairs and see if were in yet
is that okay with you
then the phone rings
everyone looks at it
i thought the phones were dead
it rings again
the phones are dead
eric grabs a woman teller who is crying hysterically and lifts her to her feet
he drags her to the ringing phone
she is crying too hard
eric puts his gun to her head
answer it or you will die
she slowly picks up the phone
answering phone through tears banque internationale de paris
she pauses then hands the phone to eric
its for you
eric takes the phone and pushes her to the floor
he puts the receiver to his ear
into phone hello
pause who is this
eric motions to oliver to check the windows
oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds
oh my god
into phone what do you want
eric looks around at the dead bodies
into phone were all fine in here
oliver is pacing back and forth wildly
he starts loading extra ammo into his weapon
into phone no
ill tell you what you go fuck yourself you fucking pig
you send anyone near this building and ill kill the first person i lay my hands on
ive got plenty hostages here to kill so dont even think of coming in
pause just stay put
well call you when were ready
in the mean time have a nice day
eric hangs up the phone and then leaves it off the hook
the silent alarm must have gone off after all
shut the fuck up
the alarm didnt do shit
for all we know your idiot shooting brought them here
anyhow it doesnt matter
nothing has changed
what are we going to do
we dont have to do anything
the plan stays the same just slightly different
then eric catches sight of zoey their eyes lock
eric smiles and winks
then he turns to jean with a whisper
if the police decide to come in
and if you dont mind stack those bodies somewhere else
this place is a fucking mess and its bad for morale
then he takes off downstairs smiling
jean is a little stumped
as eric walks down the stairs and through the reserve vault area a look of intense concentration washes over his face
you can see that a trillion calculations are being made in his brain
the question is are there any answers
zed is drilling now with a hand drill
he removes it and blows into the hole
shavings come out
eric comes trotting into the antechamber whistling
turning to eric whats going on
they were just scaring them
well did you tell them to stay quiet
just having fun
zed looks into the hole
he has drilled into the vault door revealing some wiring
fucked up my drill bit
you can buy another one
zed takes out a volt meter from his briefcase and inserts the two prongs into the hole
cross your fingers
the volt meters needle jumps
we find the fuse box
itll probably be upstairs
zed gets up
ill find it for you
i need to see it myself
zed jumps up and into the storage elevator area with eric close behind him
i think it would be better if i looked for you
i could instead of walking upstairs zed finds the fuse box right in the next room
here she is
eric is a bit relieved
zed opens it up
he looks through the fuses and then finds the one he wants
okay you throw this fuse switch off and then back on when i call to you
any other switch may set off the alarm
oh i wouldnt want to do that
serious got it
nodding got it
zed goes back to the vaults
zed trots back to the poseidon vault door and quickly grabs a little gizmo from out of his briefcase
it is a little home made black box with a series of leds on it and two wires coming out of one side with alligator clips on the end
three other wires are also coming out of it
he slips the alligator clips into the hole and latches them
he then tapes one of the wires to the vault itself
the two remaining wires he hooks up to a large twelve volt battery
come on sweetie dont fail me now
he looks toward the door leading to the reserve vault area
calling to eric ready
calling back ready
zed turns on his little box the leds start flickering
the lights go out and then back on
there is a whirring sound from the vault door
the leds quickly go from red to green
there is a loud heavy clicking as the vault door unlocks
zed smiles and swings the door open revealing the interior of the poseidon vault
eric comes running in like a kid on christmas morning
he and zed hug
oh my god it worked
zed looks into the poseidon vault at the passage connecting it to the main vault
it is covered by a small locked cage
i can get through that lock in a minute
then do it
we dont have all day
zed enters the poseidon vault
zed goes to the gated passage which isnt much more than a window in one upper side of the vault but its enough to get him into the main vault
eric is right behind him
zed takes a twirl at the combination lock
dime store brand
three minutes max
then theres a gunshot
the bullet comes from the calibre vault through the window and almost hits zed
zed falls backwards onto the floor
then theres another gunshot
the bullet ricochets through the vault
scrambling on their hands and knees zed and eric crawl out of the poseidon vault
they take cover
another shot is fired into the vault
zed and eric look into the vault
another security guard
i think i stained my pants
oliver comes running in with his gun ready for action
what is it
i came down to see how things were going and heard shots
some asshole in the vault
oliver takes cover and cocks his gun
weve got guns
why dont we just storm in and blast his fucking ass
its three against one
lets give it the old quiet
im just trying to be helpful
just let me think
you dont have to snap at me
eric peeks into the vault
calling into the vault hey you
play times over
why dont you throw out your gun
calling from main vault no
oliver and eric look at each other and smile
we dont want to kill you
youll have to
quietly to zed what is this guys problem
then to the guard come on
youre making me impatient
i dont have all day
look dont take it personally
this is my job
oliver and eric look at each other and shrug
then eric sees something in zeds briefcase
it looks like grey clay
then take a paid vacation
we wont tell if you wont
there is a pause
during this time eric takes the clay and pushes a detonator into it
quietly what the hell are you doing
have you gone mad
well look were going to give you fifteen minutes to change your mind
zed starts to grab the plastique away from eric
holding his voice down thats too much
i like danger
then to the guard changed your mind yet
eric creeps into the room and activates the detonator
zed and oliver run for cover
and im not going to
why dont you just take the money from the other vaults
eric tosses the bar of plastique through the caged window and makes a break for it
there is a huge explosion in the adjoining main vault
the walls quake and a fireball bellows out of the caged window blowing it open
the vault guard screams and then goes silent
francois claude and jean are forcing customers to drag dead bodies into a cube
the room shakes and everyone looks toward the hall that leads to the stairs
the hostages whose nerves are already shot start crying
should we see if theyre okay
theyre just blasting the vault open
what does it matter now
were fucking surrounded by police
dust has blown out of the vault and is settling on oliver zed and eric who is laughing like a madman
zed is looking at him like hes crazy
you could have killed us all
but i didnt
lets go check out the damage
eric gets up and walks into the poseidon vault
before zed follows him he looks at oliver who doesnt know what to think
he points to the caged window
its been blown off its hinges
i beat you
i opened it in under three minutes
he starts laughing and then crawls through the connecting passage into the caliber vault
zed with his briefcase follows
to oliver go around and wait at the main vault door
when i tell you open it up
when you tell me ill open it up
zed crawls through the opening
ill be at the other vault waiting for you to call to me
the main vault looks like what a vault would look like if it were blown up from the inside
on the floor is the still smoldering body of the security guard
the room is incredibly smokey
zed squeezes through the opening
then eric grinning like a schoolboy emerges from the smoke with a brick sized bar of pure gold
look at it
were all rich
the smoke clears and we see that on the far side of the vault there is a huge platen on wheels with bricks of gold stacked onto it
eric starts laughing
zed looks at him like hes crazy
were not out of here yet
yes but were rich
zed takes a seat at the vault door
the backside of a vault door looks like an incredibly intricate clock
zed removes the plexiglass shielding
im going to show the others
he squirms out of the entry with the brick of gold
zed shakes his head and goes to work setting dials and using his voltmeter to test electrical points
claude is talking to jean
you think we may actually get out of this
youre fooling yourself
why are you such a pessimist
are you kidding me
look at this mess
jean surveys the mess the crying people
this is nothing
imagine the police outside
were dead men
eric walks in from the rear stairs
in his hand is a brick of gold
jean francois claude
look at this
they see the gold
you did it
you got in
zed is opening the vault now
this is a taste
eric holds the bar of gold up for all the people to see
look at this and tell me im not brilliant
crying youre a monster
and youll never leave this place alive
eric shoots her with his uzi
to the hostages none of you are worth half of this single bar
francois jean and claude look at each other
can i speak with you
theres no need
i have nothing to hide
what is it claude
were surrounded by the police and we have no way out
what are we going to do
eric slaps him across the face
what are you doing claude
talking of all this false doubt
what do you think were going to do
claude is hurt not physically but emotionally
i dont know
not the original plan
obviously since ricardo fucked us up and didnt kill the concierge fast enough
and killing all these assholes motioning to all the customers isnt going to do us a damn bit of good now is it
because well need them as hostages when we get on the plane
were going on a plane
eric pats his shoulder
claude you are a mental giant
leave the plans up to me and just kill people if they get out of line okay
eric turns and starts to walk toward the downstairs
im going to see how things are going
eric is whistling while he walks he pauses to perform a quick magic trick then he continues
eric walks into the reserve vault area
he hears something
a scratching sound
he looks at its source two policemen decked out in black flak jackets and gas masks are starting to come out of a sewer manhole
erics eyes widen
he takes his silencer out of his coat and fixes it to his handgun
then like a man with intent to kill he rapidly approaches them
the one who came out of the manhole turns just in time to see eric fire into his chest
then eric aims the gun into the tight crawlspace and fires into the other man
for safe measure he empties his gun into the tiny causeway
he drops the gun into the hole and then shoves the other policeman into it
he then pushes a large utility wagon over the manhole cover to stop anyone else from coming in
eric comes running out from the reserve vault area and up the stairs to the lobby
eric rushes into the lobby
they want to fuck with me
they want to fuck with me
he puts the phone on the hook
it instantly rings
he answers the phone
you want to fuck with me
ill show you what happens to people who fuck with me
he throws the phone to the ground and looks at zoey
the moment of truth my love
you knew it would come
he grabs zoey and lifts her to her feet
then the assistant manager stops him
what ever it is youre going to do have mercy
eric suddenly calms down
to zoey you have quite a reach my lovely
is he one of your clients
he pushes zoey to the ground
its a deal
dont mention it
he grabs the assistant manager and at gunpoint forces him to the main entrance
what are you doing
clearing up the how full of shit am i question the cops are asking themselves right now
the assistant manager is putting up a bit of a struggle but eric simply forces him along
everyone waits until suddenly they hear a burst of gunfire from outside
they all scream
eric walks back into the bank he picks up the phone
into phone hello
then to claude im holding
after a little bit of a wait someone comes on the other end of the line
into phone hello
pause you dont know the fucking half of it
so just shut the fuck up and listen
try any more stunts and ill fucking really go crazy
pause well thats good because if you faggot cops even think of it ill kill some more people
none of that
we wont trade
that never works
not in the movies not in real life
were going to get into our van with a couple of people go to the airport and fly out of this shit hole city
and youre not going to follow us
pause who do you fucking think is going to supply the plane
no you fucking imbecile the french taxpayers would be a good second guess for you
youre really pissing me off
you think im a fucking amature
he covers the mouth piece
to claude i fucking hate cops
zed is sweating as he works away at the back of the door
he glances over what hes done and makes a calculation on a calculator
then there is a groaning sound
zed terrified spins around
another groaning sound
the vault security guard isnt dead
his body is charred and hes not moving but hes very much alive
im going to die
zed cant believe what hes seeing
he moves over to the body leaving his work behind
im going to die
please hold my
want to die
zed hovers over the body afraid to touch it
he gives it a nudge with his foot
the body groans and then exhales the longest exhale ever
zed kneels down next to the body
are you still there
zed puts his hand to the neck of the vault guard and checks for a pulse
zed sits there for a moment looking at the corpse then like he wants to get out of there as soon as possible he scrambles to the door and starts
adjusting several switches
he has wired a battery to two leads
he takes out a wire cutter and snips a wire
there is a sudden barrage of whirring and clicking sounds as the vault unlocks
zed calls to oliver from the passage
oliver is staring at the dead bodies of the manager and sub lobby teller
distant calling from the vault oliver now
open the vault
oliver turns the large wheel and opens the caliber vault door
with some amount of energy the door opens
standing inside is zed
he steps out of the vault
do you want to give me a hand
oliver puts his gun down and they go into the calibre vault
oliver sees the huge platen of gold bricks
zed puts his steel briefcase on top of it
here help me with this
eric slams the phone down and then in a fit of rage tears the phone from the wall
he grabs his machine gun and aims it at the sub lobby guard
the sub lobby guard braces himself for gunfire
eric fires into him
he is dead instantly
eric fires into his dead corpse until his gun runs out of bullets
thats what you get
claude puts his hand on erics shoulder
eric looks at him
the fucking police wont budge
i kill a man and they dont care
they say they dont make deals with terrorists
it really fucks up my plan
and what if we gave up
eric cant believe this
laughing claude look around you
were not talking prison here
the cops will give in
you start killing women
they give in
theyre all so fucking much in love with women
then he looks at zoey
what are you looking at you fucking whore
she doesnt want to say a thing thatll upset him
are you afraid ill tell these people that this is only a day job for you
she shakes her head no
so they know that youre a the sub lobby assistant speaks up
leave her alone
eric cracks the butt of his gun into the mans face
he clicks another clip into the uzi and grabs zoey by the collar and lifts her to her feet
my only mistake was not to make an example of a woman to begin with
zed takes the dolly and starts wheeling the platen of gold out
oliver helps him
this is unbelievable
look at all of this
its wonderful to touch
just help me steer this out
they maneuver out of the calibre vault
they come out of the calibre vault with the huge platen
do you think we should get some cash also
well you never know
they start maneuvering the platen toward an elevator
money is too easily traceable
youd never be able to spend it
and forget about exchanging it
your best bet is to get these bars melted down in tunisia or korea
eric knows someone in portugal
they get into the banks private freight elevator
zed closes the door and pushes the button to go up to the ground floor
eric is dragging zoey by the hair toward the door when she grabs his groin and starts squeezing
eric lets out a shrill scream and whacks the butt of the uzi into her face
but she wont let go
her years as a prostitute have taught her to ignore pain
she grabs hold of the gun hand
groaning you fucking bitch
a few bursts of the uzi go off and one shell stitches erics foot red
eric lets go and falls to the ground
claude jean and francois suddenly become attentive to whats going on
zoey starts firing the uzi but cant control it
she showers the room with bullets
she starts to run toward the back office blindly firing the gun in the direction of claude eric francois jean and the other hostages
then a tear gas cannister break through the top windows and start clouding the place up
eric whips out his switch blade and hops on his bloody red foot
zed is waiting for the elevator to arrive
do we have a covering of some kind
something to cover this with
itll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold
oh it wont matter
the police know what were up too
what do you mean they know what were up too
you dont know
weve been discovered
but eric has them under control
zed is frantic
no i didnt know
how many police
the building is surrounded
the elevator doors open onto the ground floor to the sound of automatic gunfire
zed walks out into the back office
suddenly from the back office zed sees zoey blasting away an uzi and running toward the rear stairwell
eric is in the lobby limping around
the other gang members are ducking from her fire
then her clip runs out
she sees zed their eyes lock
an image overcomes zed
she runs down the stairs to the back
oliver aims his gun to fire and zed pushes it up
olivers gun discharges into the ceiling
oliver and zed begin to struggle
zed and oliver collapse out of the back office and into the lobby
they tumble onto the floor
eric hobbles over to them his gun aimed at zed
what the fuck are you doing
zoe is near tears
she drops the empty machine gun to the floor and starts walking toward the sub lobby
eric leans down to talk to zed
oliver and jean are watching
francois and claude are more worried about the tear gas
theyre trying to smoke us out eric
what do we do
eric waves them off with a brush of his hand
hes concentrating on zed
do you really love your bitch whore girlfriend that much
shes really fucked with your mind
what are you talking about
eric lifts him to his feet and holds him up against the knife
he turns him toward the smoke and whispers into his ear
look at it
its all for us
they have no idea of who theyre dealing with
they have no idea what kind of men we are
thinking eric is a madman what kind of men are we
eric looks at him and gives him a soft kiss on the cheek
you can no longer be in our club
you forfeit your cut of the pie
zed laughs theres not gonna be much of a pie to eat
what about our friendship
i havent seen you in years
you hardly know me
he slashes zed across the face with the switchblade
zed falls backwards and tumbles down the stairs like a rag doll
never let a girl come between two men
he walks down the hall toward the gold
now lets try to get out of here
eric walks into the back office
the others look at each other
suddenly a black figure runs across the bank behind the shadows francois sees it and nervously fires
in the background the distinctive sound of european police sirens wail as more cars pull up to the outside of the bank
also an unintelligible voice is blaring orders over a bullhorn
theyre entering the building
suddenly all of them start firing like blindly into the smoke
francois runs back to eric who has walked up to the elevator via the back office
eric caresses his hand across the bars of gold
to himself smoother and more giving than the most selfless human being
francois runs in
jesus what now
the police are coming in
get a hostage
frantic they dont give a fuck about the hostages
jean becomes a berzerker and runs out into a cloud of smoke and throws the tear gas container into the thick cloud
then he turns to the police and holds his own gun to his head
dont make me
a single bullet passes through his torso
as jean falls to the ground he lets loose a round of gunfire into the ceiling
oliver is still firing his face is red like a crazed man
from behind the counter the sub lobby assistant grabs a hold of claude and wrestles him to the ground
the other customers start to flee for cover
oliver sees the fracas between the sub lobby assistant and claude
it looks like the sub lobby assistant is getting the upper hand
oliver swings his gun around and sprays machine gun fire at them
killing them both
zoe walks up the stairs out not only are they locked but a cloud of tear gas is pouring into the downstairs sub lobby
suddenly zed stumbles in
zed is like a zombie
then he notices zoe in the stairwell
they lock eyes
almost delerious zoe
she steps down into the sub lobby machine guns crackle in the background
she runs up to him just as he slumps to the ground
holding him my zed
theyve hurt you
she dabs a cloth to his cut face
he holds it on
trying to comfort him youre going to be okay
in many countries scars on the face are a symbol of heroism
to proudly display a flaw like a badge
is to wear a badge of truth
he takes her hand
be serious zoe
i can stick my tongue through my cheek
the police are now laying it on heavy
francois comes out of the office
lets get a hostage
this is the end
francois is ripped into by machine gun fire
oliver races past him
tear gas is starting to fill the room
zoe stands zed up
listen to me
were going to lock ourselves into one of the air tight vaults
if any of them are still open
they start walking toward the reserve vault area
eric hops into the elevator and closes the door just as oliver runs up firing toward the police
eric is laughing manically as he leaves them behind
oliver turns to where the police will surely be coming in
zoey and zed rush into the reserve vault area
zoey notices that the downstairs reserve vault is closed
the vault has been closed
what about the others
the gunfire upstairs has subsided and has been replaced by unintelligible police voices
theres no gunfire
zoey quietly opens the door opposite the vault that leads to the rear stairs to the lobby level
zoey peeks up the stairs just in time to see oliver bolt for the stairs
to police motherfuckers
a volly of gunfire rips into oliver but he stands his ground and fires into the police
you wanna fuck with me
you wanna fuck with me
ill show you who youre fucking with
he starts blasting away
terrified zoey leads zed to the storage elevator area
cmon well be safer in here
the elevator door opens eric steps out and looks around like a caged animal
then zed and zoey appear from the hall to the reserve vault area
eric turns to them with his gun raised when he sees them he lowers it
they all stand there for a moment the gunfire cracking away upstairs
eric is more casual than he should be
matter of factly whats your girlfriends name
to zoey in french zoe come here to me
zoey spits at him
eric laughs and aims the gun at her
killing you would just be gravy so dont fuck with me
go ahead you slob
shave my ass
eric smashes the side of her face with the gun and then grabs a hold of her arm
zed tries to stop eric but eric aims the gun at him
ill kill you
it means nothing to me our friendship
starting out calm and then building to a scream eric
theres no fucking way out of here
oh but youre wrong
this is my way out
this dime store couge with her motor driven ass
you find your own
zed rushes eric and zoey starts scratching
eric drops the gun but quickly whips out his knife
she tries to get away from eric but he has a hold on her shirt
eric swipes at her with the knife and grazes he back
then eric slashes toward zed who jumps back
zoey falls to the floor
im going to cut you like a sausage
zed is standing between zoey and eric
zoey get out of here
she scrambles away
he swipes at zed
zed jumps back down the hall toward the reserve vault area
they rush out toward the stairs
did you see how she ran
did you see how she ran
she doesnt care about you
fucking pussy only cares about pussy
look out for number one
what do you say zed
he swipes again
i will kill you
and once i kill you zed ill get out of here
ill fuck your bitch up the ass and give her aids
if she doesnt already have it
what do you say to that zed
he swipes and zed grabs a hold of the knife by the blade
eric pulls it free and the knife falls to the floor
zed takes this opportunity and kicks eric in the face
eric reaches for the knife
zed his hand bloody dives onto eric
zoey also jumps onto them and starts yanking on erics hair
she plunges her nails into his face
zed is rabbit punching eric from underneath
then eric grabs a hold of zeds balls and squeezes
zed lets out a shrill scream
eric starts elbowing zoey in the face
the three of them lay there on the floor wriggling like worms unable to move because each is putting the other through such agony
then oliver shot up and bloody haplessly stumbles into the room
his body is a mass of bullet wounds
where is thy yoke
he clumsily falls dead to the ground his shotgun slides near zoey zed and eric
the sight of the gun gives eric the strength only a madman could posses
he rolls over and throws zoey off him
then he smashes his forehead into zeds nose bursting it
eric deftly rolls over and grabs the gun
he gets to his feet and cocks the pump action
fuck both of you
then he notices the lack of gunfire upstairs
eric turns back to them
he aims to kill zed
then all of the french policemen decked out in their assault gear and wearing gas masks storm down the stairs
at the sight of eric about to execute zed they raise their guns
it becomes quiet
then eric looks back down at zed and braces for the shotgun kick
i give you little kiss
he squeezes the trigger and
the police open fire with their french made assault machine guns and fill eric with bullets
instead of falling he does a scarecrow dance as his body is painted red
the wall behind them explodes as plaster sprays all over zed
an image overcomes eric
erics dead body slumps to its knees and flops on top of zed
zed pushes the body off and tries to drag himself to zoey
zoey runs up to him and holds him
the police all charge into the secondary vault area and secure the downstairs
zoey is crying as she holds zed
the police have their guns aimed at the two of them
zoey looks up
to the policemen i work here
this man is a customer
he needs medical help
they take their guns away and kneel next to him seeing if hes okay
how bad do you think his wounds are
the other policeman unable to tell because of erics blood simply shakes his head
to zoey are you alright
zoey starts to cry
zoey and zed bandaged up are being aided by all of the french policemen as they walk through the bank
smoke is still clearing but the bodies of customers and bank robbers alike litter the area
paramedics wearing all white try to help the injured they assist zed and zoey
to zoey and zed theres an ambulance outside
he looks around my god
what a bastille day
zeds attention is caught by two other policemen carrying a body bag
to french policeman this ones the ringmaster
we need an no longer interested in zoey or zed he goes to check out the body
i have a car
zoey puts her arm around zed and helps him out of the bank
never to return
zoey is driving
zed looks like hes been in a burning building
im so tired
well go to my flat
you can rest there
do you feel pain
it was mostly his blood
i have a shower
you can clean up there
thank you zoe
he looks at her
my name is not zoe

he looks forward at the streets of paris

then ill show you the real paris
