b if window
href b b by callie khouri final shooting script louise is a waitress in a coffee shop
she is in her early thirties but too old to be doing this
she is very pretty and meticulously groomed even at the end of her shift
she is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter
it is making a lot of racket which she is oblivious to
there is country muzak in the b
which she hums along with
thelma is a housewife
its morning and she is slamming coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left from last nights
dinner which had to soak
she is still in her nightgown
the tv is on in the b
from the kitchen we can see an incomplete wallpapering project going on in the dining room an obvious do it yourself attempt by thelma
louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number
thelma goes over to answer it
hollering i got it
at pay phone i hope youre packed little housewife cause we are outta her tonight
well wait now
i still have to ask darryl if i can go
you mean you havent asked him yet
for christ sake thelma is he your husband or your father
its just two days
for gods sake thelma
dont be a child
just tell him youre goin with me for cryin out loud
tell him im havin a nervous breakdown
thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them
we see various recipes torn out from womens magazines along the lines of ways to cook pork
he already thinks youre out of your mind louise that dont carry much weight with darryl
are you at work
no im callin from the playboy mansion
ill call you right back
thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister
honey youd better hurry up
darryl comes trotting down the stairs
polyester was made for this man and hes dripping in mens jewelry
he manages a carpeteria
damnit thelma dont holler like that
havent i told you i cant stand it when you holler in the morning
im sorry doll i just didnt want you to be late
darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror and its obvious he likes what he sees
he exudes over confidence for reasons that never become apparent
he likes to think of himself as a real lady killer
he is making imperceptible adjustments to his over moussed hair
thelma watches approvingly
she decides not to tell him have a good day at work today
you want anything special for dinner
no thelma i dont give a shit what we have for dinner
i may not even make it home for dinner
you know how fridays are
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night
youd almost think theys want to forget about it for the weekend
well then its a good thing youre not regional manager and i am
hes finally ready
he walks to the door and gives thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek
i wont wait up
we see his corvette parked out front
as he closes the front door thelma leans against it
hes gonna shit
thelma laughs to herself
she goes back into the kitchen and picks up the phone and dials it
the pay phone on the wall rings
albert a busboy in his s answers
why yes she is
is this thelma
oh thelma when you gonna run away with me
louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand
to albert not this weekend sweetie shes runnin away with me
into phone hi
whatd he say
what time are you gonna pick me up
ill be there around two or three
what kind of stuff do i bring
i dont know
warm stuff i guess
its the mountains
i guess it gets cold at night
im just gonna bring everything
i will too
and steal darryls fishin stuff
i dont know how to fish louise
neither do i thelma but darryl does it how hard can it be
ill see you later
they both hang up
louise pulls out in a green t bird in mint condition
going into the suitcase is bathing suits wool socks flannel pajamas jeans sweaters t shirts a couple of dresses way too much stuff for a two day trip
reveal thelma standing in front of a closet trying to decide what else to bring as if shes forgotten something
the room looks like it was decorated entirely from a sears catalog
its really frilly
a perfectly ordered suitcase everything neatly folded and orderly
three pairs of underwear one pair of long underwear two pairs of pants two sweaters one furry robe one nightgown
she could be packing for camp
her room is as orderly as the suitcase
its not quite as frilly as thelmas but it is of the same ilk
she is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks
she decides not to and closes the suitcase
she goes to the phone picks it up and dials
we hear hi
this is jimmy
im not here right now but ill probably be back cause
all my stuffs here
leave a message
louise slams down the phone
a framed picture of louise and jimmy sits on the table next to the phone
she matter of factly slams that face down too
thelma is still throwing stuff in randomly now
she talks to herself quietly the whole time
she is taking stuff off of her nightstand a small clock fingernail scissors etc
she opens the drawer of her nightstand
her attitude is purposeful she looks as if she knows exactly what shes doing although frankly she has no idea and each decision is completely arbitrary
as she rifles through it plucking various items from among the jumbled contents we see there is a gun in there one darryl bought her for protection
it is unloaded but there is a box of bullets
she picks up the gun like its a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse
muttering to herself psycho killers
she grabs the box of bullets and throws them in too
she tries to close her suitcase but there is stuff hanging out all over the place
she stuffs things back in the sides and heaves all her weight against the top
louises green t bird convertible pulls into the driveway of thelmas house
the garage door goes up and thelma is standing in the garage with all her gear
a suitcase that looks like it might explode fishing gear a cooler a lantern
thelmas car a beat up gray honda is parked in there too
louise gets out of the drivers seat
we dont need the lantern
the place has electricity
i wanna take it anyway
just in case
in case of what
in case theres some escaped psycho killer on the loose who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us
going along with her oh yeah sure thelma that lantern will come in real handy
maybe we could tow your car behind in case he steals the spark plugs
wed have to
that thing barely makes it down the driveway
they load everything into the car
the trunk barely closes
thelma heaves all her weight against it
they get into the car and pull out of the driveway
as they drive down the street we hear thelma let out a long howl
she is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air
they are driving down the interstate
thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun
louise will you take care of the gun
louise shrieks at the sight of it
why in hell did you bring that
thelma wonders if louise is really that naive
oh come on louise
psycho killers bears
i just dont know how to use it
so will you take care of it
louise reaches over and takes the gun out of thelmas purse and holds it in her hand
she tests the weight of it and then puts it under the seat
thelma puts the bullets under the seat
they are speeding off down the highway with the radio blaring
louise puts in a tape of wild r b music
whose place is this again
its bobs the day managers
hes gettin a divorce so his wifes gettin this place so hes just lettin all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys
ive never had the chance to go out of town without darryl
how come he let you go
cause i didnt ask him
aw shit thelma hes gonna kill you
well he has never let me go
he never lets me do one goddamn thing thats any fun
all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while hes out doing god only knows what
they are both silent for a minute
looking straight ahead i left him a note
i left him stuff to microwave
after a pause
i guess you havent heard anything from jimmy
louises jaw tightens
the car speeds up
a huge semi tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway and honks
the mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women
there is a bumper sticker on the back that says lick you all over ten cents
one of your friends
thelma is watching herself in the side mirror pretending to smoke a cigarette
thelmas pov of a sign alongside the road that reads see you in church on sunday
thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out
louise gives her a sidelong glance but does not say anything
how much longer is it gonna be
another hour of so
weve got enough food for a month
ill never make it
cant we stop just for a few minutes
weve not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is thelma
then what difference does it make if we stop
i never get to do stuff like this
louise realizes that thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in
alright but its gonna be a quick stop
they pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon
its called the silver bullet
the sign flashes cocktails beer dancing food
there is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars
even though its early you can tell this place is a real night spot
its already pretty crowded
this place is jumpin
there are ten pool tables with crowds all around
the long bar is filled with customers
there are tables and booths
the room is dense with smoke
there is a dance floor but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up
there are a lot of single men
many heads turn and follow thelma and louise to an empty table
i havent seen a place like this since i left texas
isnt this fun
a waitress comes over and drops two menus on the table
yall wanna drink
ill have wild turkey straight up and a coke back please
as the waitress leaves thelma
tell me somethin
is this my vacation or isnt it
i mean god youre as bad as darryl
i just havent seen you like this in a while
im used to seeing you more sedate
well ive had it up to my ass with sedate
you said you and me was gonna get outta town and for once just really let our hair down
well darlin look out cause my hair is comin down
as the waitress returns laughing alright
to waitress i changed my mind
ill have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side please
as the waitress leaves a man comes over with a chair which he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards
he is in his late s heavyset his face is shiny in the neon light
now what are a couple of kewpie dolls like you doin in a place like this
mindin our own business why dont you try it
well we left town for the weekend cause we wanted to try and have a good time
and because louise here is mad because her boyfriend wont call her while hes out on the road
louise kicks thelma under the table
quieter we just wanted to get somethin to eat
well you come to the right place
you like chili
they got good chili
the waitress returns with louises drink
harlan are you botherin these poor girls
i was just bein friendly
making eye contact with louise its a good thing theyre not all as friendly as you
your names harlan
i got an uncle named harlan
is he a funny uncle
cause if he is then he and i got somethin in common
thelma laughs too but doesnt really get the joke
louise does not laugh
to harlan i dont mean to be rude but ive got something i need to talk to my friend about
aw i understand
i didnt mean to bother ya
its just hard not to notice two such pretty ladies as yourselves
standing to thelma you better dance with me before you leave or ill never forgive you
thatd be fun
harlan leaves then jeez louise that wasnt very nice
cant you tell when somebodys hittin on you
so what if he was
its all your years of waitin tables has made you jaded thats all
well just relax will ya
youre makin me nervous
thelma knocks back her shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass to the waitress to bring her another one
the waitress sees her and nods
she turns back to face her friend
so jimmy still hasnt called yet
givin him a taste of his own medicine
im sorry louise
i know youre all upset
its just im so excited to be out of the house i guess
pause i wonder if darryls home yet
i wonder if jimmys gotten back
why dont you tell him to just to get lost once and for all
why dont you ditch that loser husband of yours
they both drift off momentarily contemplating their domestic problems until the waitress comes over rolling her eyes this ones on harlan
thelma looks over at the bar where harlan is grinning at her making dancing motions
she smiles and waves at him
her face becomes serious again as she turns back to louise
jimmyll come in off the road you wont be there hell freak out and call you a hundred thousand times and sunday night youll call him back and by monday
hell be kissin the ground you walk on
thelmas mind goes too fast for her mouth and the speed at which she speaks can be staggering
louise is used to it
louise smiles wistfully at thelmas assessment of the situation
in the meantime you said we were gonna have some fun
so lets have some
she again drinks her whole shot of wild turkey and holds up her glass as the band strikes up a lively tune
practically the whole place whoops and heads for the dance floor
louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass too
thelma is dancing with harlan and has been for quite a while
louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named dan
thelma is breathless drunk and giggly
she holds a beer bottle in one hand
she is laughing a lot about nothing and harlan is studying her closely
louise notices this
over the noise thelma im gonna hit the little girls room and then we gotta hit the road
eyes closed swaying with the music ready when you are
louise heads off to the bathroom
eyes still closed louise im gonna come with you
she gets a funny look on her face i dont feel so good
she stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle
louise is heading towards the bathroom where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her
catching thelma copping feels oopsy doopsy
we need to get you some fresh air little lady
he steers her towards the door
louise leans against the wall waiting in line
harlan is hauling thelma out the door into the parking lot
she is pretty limp
the waitress is going over to their table
she picks up thelmas purse off the floor and puts it on her chair
she sets the check on the table looks around to see if she can see them and walks away
louise goes into the bathroom
she stands in front of the sink and looks at herself in the mirror
thelma has been sick
she has harlans handkerchief and is wiping her mouth
harlan has backed off for this part but hes right back in there
how you feelin now darlin
harlan is leaning close to thelmas head and she pulls her head away
i guess im startin to feel a little better
yeah youre startin to feel pretty good to me too
he pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her
thelma pulls away
uncomfortable i think i need to keep walking
louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in
she scans the room looking for thelma
she doesnt see her
she goes over to the table and sees thelmas stuff there
she picks up the check and looks at it
harlan has led thelma off to the far end of the parking lot
he is trying to kiss her now
he is pushing her arms down and turning her head away
i dont feel good
ive been sick
im married too
harlan is pushing himself on her now and she is beginning to push him away harder
louise is paying the waitress
the waitress is shaking her head indicating she hasnt seen thelma either
louise picks up thelmas stuff and heads towards the door
harlan has now pinned thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck
he has her ass in his hands
he is beginning to hump her
she is pushing him away as hard as she can but he is relentless
breathing heavily youre beautiful
i wont hurt you
struggling stop it
goddamnit i mean it
louise is gonna wonder where i am
louise is alright
is now standing outside the door of the silver bullet
she is looking around
is pulling at thelmas clothes
thelma gets one of her arms free and hits him hard in the face
he hits her back and grabs her face squeezing it hard
dont you hit me
dont you fucking hit me
there is no trace of friendliness in his face now
he looks mean and dangerous
he lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her
he holds both of her arms with one hand
you just shut up
with his free hand he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up
thelma is still struggling and there are tears running down her face
dont hurt me
he turns her around pushing her face down onto the back of the car
he holds both her arms in one hand and continues pulling her dress up over her hips
he starts to undo his pants as we hear the crunch of gravel
let her go
tight shot of the barrel of thelmas gun being pressed into the nape of harlans neck
louises thumb pulls back the hammer
you let her go you fat fucking asshole or im gonna splatter your ugly face all over this nice car
harlan slowly raises his hands in the air and thelma darts out pulling her dress down
now calm down
we were just havin a little fun
louise glances at thelma
thelma shakes her head no
looks like youve got a real fucked up idea of fun
now turn around
louise starts to back away but the gun is still close to his face
his pants are undone in the front
she is still backing away with the gun raised
thelma is inching away as well
just for the future when a womans crying like that shes not having any fun
louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second
then she turns and walks away
thelma does too
pulling up his pants bitch
i should have gone ahead and fucked her
louise stops in her tracks
what did you say
i said suck my cock
louise takes two long strides back towards him raises the gun and fires a bullet into his face
we hear his body hit the gravel parking lot
the car behind him is splattered with blood
thelma and louise are both silent
we hear the sound of the nightclub in the distance
louise lowers the gun
oh my god
get the car
louise you shot him
get the car
thelma runs to get the car
quietly to herself you watch your mouth buddy
thelma comes careening up in reverse
louise hops in and thelma peels out spraying gravel
as they speed out of the parking lot back to the road we hear music blaring from the nightclub
they hit the main road with tires squealing
get back to the interstate
louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the gun
i which way
they get onto the interstate going west
louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes the gun off
her movements are as if in slow motion
she puts the gun under the seat
thelma is watching her
louise does not answer
where are we going
shaking i dont know thelma
i dont know
just shut up a minute so i can think
thelma starts to cry quietly
shouldnt we go to the cops
i mean i think we should tell the police
tell them what
what do you think we should tell them
i dont know
just tell em what happened
all of it
that he tried to rape me
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night thelma
whos gonna believe that
we just dont live in that kind of world
thelma pulls off to the side of the road
louise gets out and starts to walk around the car
she stops when she gets to the back of the car and she is sick
thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side
louise gets in the drivers side
are you alright
louise rests her head on the steering wheel
to thelma thelma
thelma doesnt hear
thelma looks at her blankly without answering
ive gotta stop for a minute
ive got to get it together
im gonna find a place to get a cup of coffee and im gonna sit down for a second
do you want to come
thelmas head moves almost imperceptibly
louise studies thelmas face
is that yes
are you up to this
again thelma slightly moves her head in a nod
louise puts the car in gear and pulls out of shot
the green t bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks
louise turns to thelma
we gotta be inconspicuous
do you know what that means
it means you dont talk to anybody
you dont draw attention to yourself in any way
do you understand that
again she twitches more than nods
tell me you understand that
thelma nods more firmly now
various pov shots of truck drivers seeing thelma and louise wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee shop
they look small and incongruous with the surroundings
slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray underneath the counter
reveal louise and thelma sitting at the counter
louise is looking at a map
the car is parked outside near the door
halfway to herself we have to think this through
we have to be smart
now is not the time to panic
if we panic now were done for
nobody saw it
nobody knows it was us
were still okay
now all we have to do is just figure out our next move
our next move
ill say one thing louise
this is some vacation
i sure am having a good time
this is real fun
if you werent so concerned with having a good time we wouldnt be here right now
just what is that supposed to mean
it means shut up thelma
so this is all my fault is it
louise looks at thelma for a long time
just shut up
the waitress comes and fills their coffee cups
thelma stands up to go to the bathroom
she grabs her purse from the counter and the strap catches on her coffee cup and it falls to the floor with a crash
all heads turn and look at her
i have to go to the bathroom
hold on louise
police cars are parked around
the activity has died down
doors on the coroners van slam shut
in the back of a police car sits the waitress with the door open
a detective in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad
could you identify em if ya saw em again
hal ive told you about twenty times yes i could identify em but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this
well youre not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure
if waitin tables in a bar dont make you an expert on human nature then nothin will and i couldve told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin it
in a parkin lot
im just surprised it didnt happen before now
who do you think did it
has anybody asked his wife
shes the one i hope did it
lena just cut the bullshit will ya
do have any ideas or dont ya
i been standin in this stupid parkin lot all goddamn night and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back
well if i had to guess id say it was some ol gal some ol gals husband
but it wasnt either one of those two
the tall one the redhead she left me a huge tip
you didnt happen to notice what kind of car they were driving
its a nightclub not a drive in hal
i dont follow the customers to the parking lot
go on home
we might have to call you in for some more questioning
lena gets out of the back of the car
those girls are not the murderous type
outside the bathroom there is a pay phone
thelma picks it up and dials
into phone collect from thelma
there is no answer
various shots of the interior of the empty dickinson house exactly as thelma left it
the drawer of the nightstand still open
taped to the refrigerator
the interior of the microwave with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the package in a little puddle
ill try later
she hangs up and goes into the bathroom
as the door closes behind her louise comes up with a handful of change and starts putting it into the phone
she dials a number
it rings for a long time
she hangs up and goes into the bathroom
she looks at herself in the mirror
she notices a tiny speck on her cheek
she takes a paper towel and wets it and rubs the spot
she looks at the towel and there is a bright red streak
come on thelma
the door of the stall flies open and thelma comes charging out and heads straight for the door without even looking at louise
louise charges out after her
they head out of the restaurant and through the window we see them get into the car and drive away
the t bird barrels down a fairly empty four lane highway
a truck passes going the other way
the top is down on the car and thelma is slouched on the seat her hair blowing wildly
were gonna go to the next town and stop
well get a motel room
i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money
were gonna need money
how much money do you have with you
oh i dont know
let me look
thelma is rummaging through her purse
she finds her wallet and takes it out
thelma finds some bills stuffed in the change compartment and takes them out
she straightens the money out
sixty four dollars
as she is counting it one of the bills flies out of her hands
thelmas not that good at handling money
forty four dollars
louise has not noticed any of this
she is so intent on her driving
im cash poor
we gotta get some money
the motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops
the curtains are open and we can see the car parked right outside the room
thelma is lying on the bed staring up at the ceiling
louise is bustling around the room putting things in drawers
why are you unpacking
you said we were just gonna take a nap
louise did not realize she was doing it
oh i dont know
im just nervous
i gotta figure out what to do
well when you figure it out wake me up
just what the hell is wrong with you
louise slams the closet door
what do you mean
why are you actin like this
actin like what
how am i supposed to act
scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebodys head off
they are silent for a moment
you could help me try and figure it out
i gotta figure out what to do and you could try and help me
i suggested we go to the police but you didnt like that so frankly louise im all out of ideas
well whats the big rush thelma
if we just give em some time theyll come to us
im just not ready to go to jail yet
why dont you go out to the pool or something and ill figure it out
give me the keys
youre not touchin that car
my stuffs in the trunk
you care more about that car than you do about most people
most people just cause me trouble but that car always gets me out of it
hal is at the police station where theyre dusting the car with harlan all over it for prints
hal looks closely at the back of the car
he holds his hands over two sets of hand prints
he moves his hands to the outside of the prints so as not to smear them and puts his hands on the car
his face is one inch away from the trunk
he sees a very clear drop of blood
its different than any of the other blood splatters on the car
he calls the identification technician over and points it out
pointing whats that
tech comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders
his i guess
hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache
he stares at the guy
hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the area of the black smudge and the drop of blood
he shakes his head slightly
thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool
she stops then decides to go on to the pool
she lies down in a lounge chair facing the road
louise in the motel room
shes looking at the phone
she picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror
she stares as if shes trying to see into herself see through herself
thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair trying desperately to feel like shes on vacation
this is jimmy
im not here right now
a voice interrupts the message hello
hang on a minute
the machine switches off
jimmy mid s musician is standing in the kitchen on the phone
hes not the type youd expect louise to like not quite straight looking enough
on phone jimmy
louise is looking at herself on the phone in the mirror
she is very choked up
on phone louise

jimmy is shocked by the gravity of her tone of voice
he realizes this is very serious

louise covers the mouthpiece with her hand
she is trying very hard not to cry
i have a savings account with about sixty seven hundred dollars in it

louise sits on the edge of the bed
she is looking at her hand
she takes the ring that she wears on her left hand and turns it around backwards to make it look like a wedding band
do you love me

louise let me call you back after i wire it so youll know which office to go to

thelma by the pool
a car screeches a loud horn honks
bellowing come on thelma
get in the car
thelma bolts upright and grabs her sundress and dashes to the car
she jumps in over the door
shes in a mild state of shock
did you finish thinking
i think better when i drive
louise peels out of the parking lot
hal is in the office talking to his superior
he stands in front of the desk with his hands in his pockets while his major sits behind the desk looking troubled
all we know is there were two women in a green t bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot going real fast
were trying to get a make on the car but nothin yet
so far we got nothin
well youd best get something
even if they didnt do it it times out that they most likely witnessed it
i want somebody to at least talk to em

thelma is staring down the road
she does not answer
then i think he does
tight shot of an indent a kit likeness of louise
on a table nearby lies a drawing strongly resembling thelma
lena the waitress sits next to the plain clothes cop who holds the indent a kit
hal picks up the drawing and studies it closely
the t bird rolls into town
louise and thelma pull up in front of an old store the kind with a wooden front porch the kind that sells bait and flannel shirts
they enter the store and see an old man behind the counter
do you have a pay phone
round the side by the restrooms
louise gets change while thelma strolls around looking at rubber worms and pickled pigs feet
louise goes out to the phone
louise dropping change into the phone
it rings and jimmy answers
is that how you answer the phone
on phone i got it
i was afraid id missed you
i almost couldnt get a check cashed
who did it
friend of mine owns a club
youd know him if you saw him
his brother was in your class
you didnt say what it was for did you
on phone no honey
i told him i was buyin a car

that was good
where do i go
on phone its a place called shaws siesta motel
the address is north east
its under your name
and whats the mysterious code word
on phone peaches
thats the code word
i miss you peaches
louise rolls her eyes and tries not to melt
she puts her finger down on the receiver
jimmy is still holding the phone to his ear
thelma in store buying gum beef jerky
next to the cash register on the counter on display are those little tiny bottles of liquor
thelma picks up a little bottle of wild turkey and puts in on the counter
the old man rings it up
she takes another one and puts it on the counter
the old man is still ringing stuff up
she takes two more and puts them on the counter
she takes the rest of the little bottles of wild turkey out of the display and puts them on the counter
she takes one little bottle of cuervo and puts it down on the counter too
the old man finally looks at her
from the wall behind him he takes a pint of wild turkey down
maam are you sure you wouldnt rather have the large economy size
louise is hanging up the phone
she walks away towards the front of the store
thelma comes out of the front of the store
the store is at a crossroads with a fair amount of vehicular traffic
go call darryl
thelma is walking towards the car
she puts her purse in the front seat
she looks at louise
dont tell him anything
tell him youre having a wonderful time and youll be home tomorrow night
will i be
i dont know
i wont be
thelma and louise look at each other while this sinks in
walks around to the side of the building to the phone
she picks it up and dials
into phone collect from thelma
louise goes into the store for a chocolate yoohoo
darryl in the den of their house
the room is a mess
there are beer cans everywhere
the large screen tv is on showing a football game
darryl is in a recliner
he is wearing loud shorts a v necked t shirt and a couple of necklaces and bracelets
goddamnit thelma where in the sam hill are you
im with louise
were in the mountains were
interrupting what in the hell do you think youre doing
have you lost your goddamn mind
is that it
i leave for work and you take complete leave of your senses
darryl calm down now honey
please dont get so mad
i can explain
darryl is mad but hes still watching the game
hold on a minute damnit
he covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where his team fumbles the ball
this only makes him madder
he puts the phone back to his ear in time to hear thelma say only for one day and well be back tomorrow night
no you wont
youll be back today
you get your ass back here thelma now goddamnit
thelma do you understand me
thelma is trying not to cry
shes trying to be strong
youre my husband not my father darryl
interrupting that does it
that louise is nothin but a bad influence
if youre not back here tonight goddamnit thelma
well i just dont wanna say
neither one of them say anything for a moment
go fuck yourself
she hangs up on him
thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car
so she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see
both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision
miss are you alright
thelma nods her head yes but tears continue
her crying is silent
is there anything i can do
thelma shakes her head no
she tries to control her tears
she notices how blue his eyes are
collects herself as she walks back to the car
she gets in and is drying her eyes looking in the side mirror
in the mirror she sees the hitchhiker come back around from the side of the building
he is several feet behind the car and she watches him as he removes his long sleeved shirt and stuffs it into his duffel bag
now he is just in t shirt and jeans
he looks good
she watches in the mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road
she can see him as hes walking
he heads over to the car
would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going
im trying to get back to school and my ride fell through so im kinda stuck
are you going my way
thelma doesnt know what to do
i think were going to oklahoma city
but im not sure
do you think you could
i mean i could help pay for gas
thelma knows louise isnt going to like this
well see its not really up to me
its not my car
umm well have to ask my friend but shell probably say no
shes a little uptight
maybe we better not ask her
but thank you anyway
now she wants him to come
he starts to walk away from the car
well we can ask her
that wont hurt
just then louise comes out of the store
she sees thelma talking to this guy and for one moment stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in then continues toward the car
although her face is basically expressionless we see that its possible she might kill thelma
louise this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride and i thought since
its probably not a good idea
the hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road
yall have a nice day
the guy does seem really nice and thelma is really frustrated that louise wouldnt give him a ride but decides not to confront her
see how polite he is
he was really nice
louise lowers the top and backs the car out
they watch him walk away
louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road
they pass the hitchhiker
to thelma you cheer up now
she turns around in the seat to continue waving
he smiles and waves
they drive down the road
tight shot of the hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face
thelma looking sulky
i wish we couldve brought him with us
what did darryl say
sarcastically he said okay thelma
i just wanted to know you were alright
i hope youre havin a good time
you sure deserve one after puttin up with me all the time
i love you honey
louise doesnt say anything
how long before were in goddamn mexico
hal goes over a list of every registered green t bird in the state
names are scrolling by as hal stares blankly at the screen
we see the name louise elizabeth sawyer scroll past
it means nothing to hal
its twenty minutes later
they are clear of the town
thelma is like a dog with a bone
she just wont let it drop
i just dont see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride
did you see his butt
darryl doesnt have a cute butt
you could park a car in the shadow of his ass
im just not in the mood for company right now
take this map
i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city
i think we should stay off the interstates
were too conspicuous
taking map well it looks like we can get on this road that heads down towards dallas then cut over to
interrupting i dont want to go that way
find a way that we dont have to go through texas
looking at map wait
you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you dont want to go through texas
you know how i feel about texas
were not going that way
i know louise but were running for our lives
dont you think you could make an exception just this once
i mean look at the map
the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas
im not gonna talk about this
now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will
how come you never said what happened
louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and thelma is totally puzzled by louises reaction but is reluctant to press her further
i just dont think its the place i wanna get caught for doin something like
if you blow a guys head off with his pants down believe me texas is the last place you wanna get caught
now i said i dont wanna talk about it
louise looks very shaken up
she keeps her eyes on the road but shes holding the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles are white
she does not look at thelma
suddenly she reaches over and locks her door
thelma flinches imperceptibly at this gesture
well go around texas to get to mexico
this is crazy
two harley davidson bikes tool past driven by a couple of ex hippies from the s
the hitchhiker is on the back of one and he waves to them as they go by
thelma waves back enthusiastically
ill tell you what
he is gooood lookin
louise pops a tape into the cassette player
hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people sitting outside to the door of an apartment complex and knocks
various shots of louises empty apartment
there are pictures of louise and thelma in high school
the kitchen is spotless and nothing is out on the counters
is unwrinkled perfect and next to it on her nightstand is a picture of jimmy and her in a small heart shaped frame
everything is extremely neat and orderly
hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people
he stops turns around and goes back to them
we see him stand and talk to them
thelma and louise are singing along with the music
pointing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
hitchhiker standing on the side of the road
thelma looks at louise pleadingly
louises car pulls over and he hops in the back seat
an animated thelma turns around backwards in the front seat to face him
hal walks into the coffee shop where louise works
various shots of him talking to other employees
albert waitress etc
some cover their mouths as they recognize police sketches of louise and thelma
the day manager comes over looks at the pictures and talks to hal
thelma passing out beef jerky and wild turkey to hitchhiker and louise
hals unmarked detective car pulls up in front of thelmas house
a corvette completely customized with everything sits in the driveway
hitchhiker leans over resting his chin on the back of the front seat
what are you studying in school

he has charmed her too
hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open to reveal a drunk darryl in hawaiian shorts necklaces and a beer can in his hand
hal and darryl in den
the tv drones in the b
pictures and papers are on the table
tight shot of darryls face
extreme closeup of darryls face
to thelma so how come you dont have any kids
darryl thats my husband he says hes not ready
hes still too much of a kid himself
he prides himself on being infantile
hes got a lot to be proud of
louise and darryl dont get along
thats puttin it mildly
she thinks hes a pig

i wish you could meet him

twenty four isnt young
id already been goin out with him ten years when we got married
ive never been with anybody but darryl
well if you dont mind me sayin so he sounds like a real asshole
he is an asshole
most of the time i just let it slide
is looking down the road way off in the distance
better slow down
thats a cop
louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car coming down the road towards them
she does not look alarmed but veers off the road into a rest area drive that has trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road
she glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them
louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all
they realize they have not been spotted
and louise look at each other
maybe you got a few too many parking tickets
well take you on to oklahoma city then youd best be on your way
hal is on the phone to the fbi man
darryl is sitting on a chair looking dazed
other law enforcement types roam around the house
the prints on the trunk of the car match those of thelma dickinson
max stratton an fbi man in his early forties is looking at the ident a kit drawings of louise and thelma
well ill be damned
isnt that strange
and the husband says a gun is missing
she took a lot of stuff
it looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while
the strange thing is her husband said she would never touch that gun
he got it for her cause hes out late a lot but he said shed never touch it wouldnt learn to shoot it just left it in a drawer for
what kind of gun was it
where are they
they were on their way to some guys cabin and they never showed up
we hope youre lookin too
the t bird barrels down the road at high speed
louise thelma and j
pull into the motel parking lot
i just gotta run in for a minute
louise looks at j
in the back seat and takes the keys out of the ignition
you two better go on and say your goodbyes
louise gets out of the car and goes inside
an older woman behind the counter is looking at a computer screen
louise elizabeth sawyer
are you sure
nothin came in today at all
louise turns and sees thelma crawl over into the back seat with j
nothing under peaches
check again under peaches
naw nothin under peaches neither
a man comes up behind louise and stands close behind her
did you say peaches
why thats the secret word
show her what shes won don
he drops an envelope in front of her
louise is startled and turns around quickly
oh my god
oh my god
what are you doin here
to woman can we get another room
just put it on my credit card
the woman hands them a key
round to the back
louise and jimmy walk outside and catch thelma sitting very close to j
thelma sees jimmy and is so startled she screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat to the other side of the car
she tries to look nonchalant
what in the world are you doin here
ask me no questions ill tell you no lies
same goes double for me
whos your friend
is climbing out of the car looking very uncomfortable
this is j
hes a student
were just givin him a ride to

to jimmy thelma kinda took to him
jimmy is smiling
to thelma well come on gal i got you a room

i always knew that
a regular outlaw
louise shoots thelma a look
the three of them drive around to the back of the motel
thelma turns and looks at the road
is standing there
he blows her a kiss
they stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them climb out of the car
let me just go in and freshen up for a minute
i need to wash my face you know
thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk
i dont want to rush you
i just wanna talk to you and
whispering be alone with you
ill just be in my room you just come on down when youre ready
jimmy helps carry the luggage to thelmas room
he stops at the door
ill be waiting
louise smiles at him quizzically as if she cant believe hes acting this way
he turns on his heel and slinks away
i dont care what you say about him
the boy has got it bad
hes always got it bad as long as im running in the other direction
dont be fooled hes no different than any other guy
he knows how to chase and thats it
once hes caught you he dont know what to do
so he runs away
i heard that
they close the door to their room
louise sets the envelope of money on the table
indicating envelope our future
louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup
she stands very close to the mirror
she is putting on lip liner
thelma is watching
so what are you gonna tell him
im not gonna tell him a thing
the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is
you are so sweet to that guy you really are
imagine not wanting to drag him into this
he is a lucky man
louise is still putting on her makeup making sure its perfect
i didnt ask him to come
its like i said thelma he just loves the chase
well boy hes got his work cut out for him now dont he
put a lid on it thelma
its hard enough as it is
just let me get this part over with

louise turns to face thelma
how do i look
youre a vision louise a goddamn vision of loveliness you always are
have another drink thelma
louise walks out the door
its raining out
louise goes to jimmys room
louise knocks on the door to room
the door opens slightly and one red rose pops out
in a falsetto voice who is it
the following eleven roses are held out the door then louise is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with laughter
thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut offs and a t shirt
her hair is still damp but she looks better than she did when she arrived
thelma is fixing a drink of wild turkey and diet up in one of the motel room glasses
there is a knock on the door
she stops what she is doing and is completely still
louise is that you
through the door thelma
thelma opens the door and there stands j
soaking wet from the rain pouring down behind him
i just thought i
i know im supposed to be gone but
hes kind of looking over towards the road
hes still slightly shy
im not havin much luck gettin a ride
he notices looking past her into the room that louise isnt there
thelma just stands there looking at him
well i guess id better
um where ya going
i dont know
what are you doin
i dont know
took a shower
that sounds nice
well you wanna use the shower
you can tell he does want to but doesnt want to say so
so instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin on his face
shes off with jimmy thats her boyfriend
thats lonely for you i guess
i always think of motel rooms as lonely
thelma pretends like shes had a lot of experience with this sort of thing
letting him in the door oh yes well they can be
jimmy is pouring champagne into louises glass
there are a dozen roses in a vase on the table
he pours for himself as he sits as close to louise as possible
now my little coconut what seems to be the trouble here
tell daddy everything
cringing jimmy my daddys still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that
okay okay just tell me whats the trouble
louise just looks at him for a minute
jimmy im not gonna tell ya what the trouble is
someday soon youll understand why i cant
but i wont tell ya so dont ask me
jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is
almost at a loss for words okay peaches okay
but can i ask you one thing
does it have something to do with another guy
are you in love with him
its nothin like that
exploding then what
what goddamnit louise
where the fuck are you going
are you just leaving for fucking ever
what did you fuckin murder somebody or what
louise spills her champagne
stop it jimmy or ill leave right now
im not kiddin
calming down alright alright
they both take a second to regain their composure
can i just ask you one other thing
jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket
will you wear this
he hands louise the box
she opens it and it is a diamond ring
louise is flabbergasted
will you at least see how it fits
you didnt see that one comin did ya
is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror wearing only his jeans the top button of which is still undone and no shirt
he has an incredible physique
he also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety
thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from a vending machine and is into her second wild turkey and up
she sits on the bed watching him in the mirror
he definitely looks better with his shirt off
she suddenly feels awkward and stands up
you wanna drink
louise has the engagement ring on her finger
its really beautiful
so whaddya think
get a job
of some kind
i mean youve been tellin me that for years right
why now jimmy
this is hard for him cause louise
i dont want to lose you
and for some reason i get the feelin youre about to split
louise doesnt know how to respond
she struggles for a reply
jimmy weve gone all these years
we never made it work
were not gonna be able to just
what kind of job honey
can you see it
jimmy doesnt answer right away
hes trying to see it
im the one
i never made it work
its not that i dont love you
its not that
i just never thought id be thirty six years old and i never thought
i dont know what i thought
what do you want darlin
what do you want me to do
i dont know
it doesnt even matter anymore
i just want you to be happy
its not that i dont love you either
but jimmy your timing couldnt be worse
jimmy does not really understand why this is happening
are you just doin this to punish me
believe me the last thing i want is for you to get punished
thelma has poured a drink for j
whos sitting on the edge of the bed
she walks over and hands it to him and as she does he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the other
he sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds her hand with both of his
he closely studies her wedding ring
he suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as intently
he slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring as if to say this is not right for you
this isnt going to work
he looks at the ring as he moves it through space finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink
he drops it in
he looks back at thelma and smiles as if to say there
now dont you feel better
he smartly kisses her hand
louise and jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed
jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking at it as jimmy holds her hand in his
they both ponder it
it does look good
is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his neck like a cape
faster than a speeding green t bird able to leap tall babes in a single bound
he leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing on the bed straddling thelma
in his deep mans voice hi
could i interest you in some fuller brushes
thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room
he is the greatest guy shes ever seen
he is sniffing her neck like a dog
giggling stop stop stop
thelma tries to catch her breath
who are you
attacks her again
i am the great and powerful oz
just tell me
i know youre not some schoolboy
now come on nobody ever tells me shit
im just some guy
a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now
you mean youre a criminal
well not anymore thelma except for bustin parole i havent done one wrong thing
what did ya do
im a robber
youre a bank robber
ive never robbed a bank
well i robbed a gas station once and i robbed a couple of liquor stores and some convenience stores
and thats it
well i was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin i was good at so i
interrupting no i mean how would you do it
do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what
naw honey that would be burglary
i never got arrested for burglary
burglarys for chicken shits
if youre gonna rob someone ya just have to go right on up to em and do it
just take the money
thats a whole nother deal
well first you pick your place see then id just sit back and watch it for awhile
ya gotta wait for just the right moment which is something you know instinctively that cant be taught
then id waltz on in
jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a gun
he starts acting it out
and id say alright ladies and gentlemen lets see wholl win the prize for keepin their cool
simon says everybody lie down on the floor
if nobody loses their head then nobody loses their head
you do the honors
just empty that cash into this bag and youll have an amazing story to tell all your friends
if not youll have a tag on your toe
then id split
my gosh you sure gentlemanly about it
ive always believed if done right armed robbery doesnt have to be a totally unpleasant experience
youre a real live outlaw
i may be the outlaw but youre the one stealin my heart
and smooth boy you are smooth
they kiss passionately
youre kinda the best thing thats happened to me in a long time
youre a little angle you are
turns out the light
louise and jimmy are wrapped in each others arms quietly making love
through this jimmy is ardent
i think you are so damn beautiful
i mean that
i always have
whispering i think youre beautiful too
montage of early morning staff a truck driver climbing into his cab with a silver thermos squirrels hopping around on the ground
tight shot of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee pot
louise and jimmy are sitting in a booth both on the same side
they are both playing with their wedding rings
dont worry darlin
ill say i never found you
ill say anything you want
well find a way to get you out of this whatever it is
damn jimmy did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff
im choking on it
they sit for a minute
do you want me to come with you
they look at each other into each other and jimmy can see that louise is already gone
louise is really touched that he asked her that but she knows its impossible
she is very kind to him
its probably not such a good idea right now
catch up with you later on down the road
in her hand shes been holding the ring in the black box
she puts it on the table and slides it back to him
he stops her suddenly
he covers her hand with his
you keep this
jimmy is trying not to seem upset so hes completely still
a taxi pulls up outside
your taxis here
jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that employees in the coffee shop look away
a cook fans himself with a spatula
the taxi driver who can see in looks at his watch
are you happy louise
i just want you to be happy
louise looks at her hand and jimmys hand
im happy sweetie
happy as i can be
jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop
louise watches him go
a waitress comes over and fills her coffee cup
good thing he left when he did
we thought we were gonna have to put out a fire
the waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too
louise waves to jimmy in the back of the cab
the cab driver winks at her
she smiles to herself
the room is totally trashed
and thelma are both asleep naked and hanging off either side of the bed
starts to stir
hal is in bed with is wife
he has to get up
he is holding his wife in his arms
do you think you could ever shoot someone
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone
i could shoot your cousin eddie
because hes an inconsiderate asshole
im asking you seriously sarah a stranger
i dont know honey
i guess it would depend
trying to picture it well maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids
im sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children
yeah i could too
i dont know why im even asking you this
we cant place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie
i dont know
i keep hearing words impossible inconceivable
if just one person would say
you just dont shoot someone like that for no reason
maybe he was askin for it
anyway somebodys husband probably got ol harlan
thats what everybody says
only problem is nobodys husband was unaccounted for that night
could you shoot eddie in the face
at point blank range
thinking in the leg
getting up i gotta go to little rock
louise is sitting in the booth by herself
thelma comes hurrying by
she looks disheveled but is grinning like an idiot
she sees louise and charges into the coffee shop
her energy and volume is several notches higher than the rest of the people in the coffee shop
there are a couple more customers in there now
thelma slides into the booth seated directly across from louise
she is shocked by thelmas appearance
what happened to your hair
it got messed up
louise is studying thelma closely as thelma squirms in her seat barely able to contain herself
whats wrong with you
do i seem different
yes now that you mention it
you seem crazy
like youre on drugs
well im not on drugs
but i might be crazy
shaking her head i dont think i wanna hear what youre gonna tell me
thelma is just about to shriek when the waitress comes over and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some
thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as the waitress goes away
oh my god louise
i cant believe it
i just really cant believe it
thelma is just laughing hysterically
louise suddenly understands
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about
this is just a whole nother ball game
thelma please get a hold of yourself
youre making a spectacle
you know louise youre supposed to be my best friend
you could at least be a little bit happy for me
you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isnt completely disgusting
i am happy
im very happy for you
im glad you had a good time
its about time
where is he now
taking a shower
you left that guy alone in the room
louise is getting a bad feeling
she is already standing up putting money on the table
wheres the money thelma
thelma has forgotten all about the money
its on the table
they are both leaving the restaurant now
as they hit the door they both break into a full run
i dont remember
they run across the parking lot around the back to the room
the door is ajar and no one is in the room
louise goes in and thelma stays outside the door
ive never been lucky
not one time
louise comes back outside
she doesnt say anything
she is stoic fighting tears
that little sonofabitch burgled me
i dont believe it
louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room
thelma comes and sits beside her
neither one says anything for a moment
are you okay
louise shakes her head no
i mean it
louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light
its not okay thelma
its definitely not okay
none of this is okay
what are we going to do for money
what are we gonna buy gas with
our good looks
louise quietly starts to fall apart
this causes thelma to leap into action
dont you worry about it
ill take care of it
just dont you worry about it
get your stuff
louise is still sitting on the sidewalk
damnit get your stuff and lets get out of here
louise slowly gets to her feet
to herself jesus christ take your damn time
thelma is hauling stuff out of the car
tight shot of rear wheel of green t bird laying rubber out of the motel parking lot
thelma and louise both looking a little rougher than weve seen so far drive away
hal fbi man various other police and detective types pull up in front of the house
the front door swings open and there stands darryl looking like hes been shot out of a cannon
louise and thelma pull into a convenience store
police are tapping the phones dusting for prints etc
while darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face
to darryl as you know weve tapped your phone
in the event that she calls in
max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway
were going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in
someone will be here until we find them
the important thing is not to let on that you know anything
we want to try and find out where they are
now i dont want to get too personal but do you have a good relationship with your wife
are you close with her
yeah i guess
i mean im about as close as i can be with a nut case like that
well if she calls just be gentle
like youre happy to hear from her
you know like you really miss her
women love that shit
thelma and louise are sitting in the car
theyve put all their money together
eighty eight dollars aint gonna make a dent baby girl
getting out of the car dont worry about it
you want anything
thelma marches off to the store
louise puts a tape in the deck and is listening to loud r b music
she checks herself in the rearview mirror
she takes her lipstick out and is about to put it on
she makes eye contact with herself and instead throws it out the window closes her eyes and leans her head back on the seat
shes in a world of shit
thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the car
louise looks at her
driving away what happened
thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills
you robbed the store
you robbed the goddamn store
thelma shrieks with excitement
louise is completely stunned
we needed the money
its not like i killed anybody for gods sake
louise shoots her a look
she puts the car in gear and floors it out of the parking lot
she is still looking at thelma as if she has completely lost her mind
well we need the money
now we have it
oh shit thelma
sternly now you get a grip louise
just drive us to goddamn mexico will ya
whatd you do
i mean what did you say
well i just
hal max various other cops and darryl all watch as tv plays back vcr tape of thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun
in perfect lip sync is alright ladies and gentleman lets see wholl win the prize for keepin their cool
everybody lie down on the floor
if nobody loses their head then nobody loses their head
tight shot of darryls face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock
tight shots of hal max etc
all looking intently at the screen
video image of thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her purse with money
as hes loading the purse with bills shes taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in there too while she points the gun at the cashier
videotape playback you sir
you do the honors
just empty that cash into this bag and youll have an amazing story to tell all your friends
if not youll have a tag on your toe
thelma and louise in car driving
incredulous holy shit
wearily my lord
lemme see the map
louise throws the map across the front seat at thelma and floors it
jimmy is entering the apartment building carrying his overnight bag
two men are sitting on the stairs
they stand as he comes in
they are plainclothes police
they show their badges
he leaves with them
made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back right pocket
is walking down the road and continues to walk as an oklahoma state patrol car pulls up alongside him
he smiles and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside him
we can see the cop nearest him talking and then we see j
stop walking and set down his duffel bag
he reaches for his wallet
its clear that they have asked for some louise is driving
they fly past a kid on his bike on a long gravel driveway
he watches them
a huge cloud of dust blows up as they pass him
he turns and rides his bike down the driveway towards the house
louise youd better slow down
ill just die if we get caught over a speeding ticket
louise looks at the speedometer touching mph and lets her foot off the gas
louise is looking a little nervous
for the first time in my life i wish this car wasnt green
are you sure we should be driving like this
in broad daylight and everything
no we shouldnt but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime
you shoulda seen me
like id been doin it all my life
nobody would ever believe it
you think youve found your calling
the call of the wild
thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of wild turkey
i believe i am
jimmy is in a small room with hal max other cops looking stunned
i swear to god she wouldnt tell me one thing
you oughta try to find that kid that was with em
tell us about him
just some young guy
around twenty years old
jimmy is really upset and has to really struggle to control himself
trying to remember him they said theyd picked him up along the way
he was a student
but he didnt look right
but he left when they got to the motel
do you understand that you may be facing an accessory charge
this is serious son
a man is dead
id tell you if i knew
i know something happened or she wouldnt have left
im trying to remember everything
find that fucking kid
he probably knows something
thelma and louise are in the car
thelma is taking empty little wild turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing them out the window
so whats the plan thelma
you just gonna stay drunk
they come roaring up on a semi tanker carrying gas
we see their fish eye reflections in the shiny tanker
the mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that thelma and louise saw earlier
the truck is going slower than they are
this always happens
whenever youre in a hurry
she noses out to see if she can pass but theres a car coming
the car passes and the truck honks
the truck drivers arm comes out his window and waves them past
isnt that nice
truck drivers are always so nice
the best drivers on the road
as they get next to the truck the truck driver is smiling and waving at them
they smile and wave back
he flicks his tongue at them
oh my god
louise floors it and speeds past him
why do they have to do that
they think we like it
maybe they think it turns us on
louise shivers with disgust
jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys
hal shows jimmy a mug shot of j
is this the guy you saw them with
looking closely its him
clapping his hands oh happy day
you gotta be kiddin me
they picked up a murderer
to hal theyre flying him here right now
he was picked up this morning for parole violation
they also found about six grand on him so he probably knocked over something while he was out there
they can drop him by here for questioning
im so happy
overhearing how much cash did he have
arriving handcuffed at state police building
the t bird is entering terrain that looks more like desert
the top of the t bird is up
i want you to call darryl
to find out if he knows anything
if you think he does you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped
jeez louise tapped the phone
you think so
agitated oh come on
murder one and armed robbery thelma
god louise cant we even say it was self defense
but it wasnt
we got away
we were walkin away
they dont know that
it was just you and me there
ill say he raped me and you had to shoot him
i mean its almost the truth
it wont work
no physical evidence
we cant prove he did it
we probably cant even prove he touched you by now
they both pause for a moment
the law is some tricky shit isnt it
then how do you know bout all this stuff anyway
louise does not answer the question
besides what do we say about the robbery
no excuse for that
no such thing as justifiable robbery
as the sun sets the t bird drives deeper into the vast desert
darryl is sitting in the hallway
two officers are leading j
down the hall
hal max other plainclothes officers follow
darryl looks at hal questioningly
hal doesnt respond and the entourage quickly goes into a room
darryl stands and crosses the hall to the room as the door shuts in his face
yelling at the door hey
whos the nut
thats thelma dickinsons husband
darryl tries the doorknob but the door is locked
hal max j
there is a vcr and monitor set up in the room and they view the videotape of thelma in the convenience store
she did good
well son shes doin a damn sight better n you right now
where did you get
we spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a miss louise sawyer
do you know her too
she was driving
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city
he also says that at that time he met a man
he identified you through a series of mug shots
he also told us that you and mrs
dickinson seemed close
is that true
you might say we had a meeting of the minds yes
did you know that mrs
dickinson and miss sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder
did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the law
surprised to hear this now that you mention it they might have been a little bit jumpy
you know what
youre starting to irritate me
hal thinks for a moment and then looks to max
do you mind if i have a word with him alone for a minute
max agrees and opens the door for the others to leave
he and hal make eye contact before max closes the door
whatd i do
hal sits down across the table from j
and looks at him
son i gotta feelin about somethin and i just wanna ask your opinion
do you think thelma dickinson would have committed armed robbery if you hadnt taken all their money
doesnt say anything
they both just sit there for a moment
cat got your tongue
shifts in his chair
how do you know i took it
how do you know they didnt just give it to me
theres two girls out there that had a chance they had a chance
and you blew it for em
now theyve gotten in some serious trouble some very serious trouble and for at least part of it im gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them
ive got no feelin for you
but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rats ass what happens to them and youre either gonna tell me every damn thing you know
so theres a small chance i can actually do them some good or im gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life
your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life
thats a sincere promise
hal walks over and opens the door and max and the others straggle back in
now for one thing you violated your parole two days out
and you know judge hainey
he hates this sort of thing
once he gets wind of this hes gonna blow sky high
and then when he finds out that youre a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery well i think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for
at least the remaining eight dont you
is somebody gonna write this down
darryl is sitting in the hallway
hal comes out of the room first
dickinson if youll just hang on i want a word with you and then well take you home
police officers lead j
out of the interrogation room down the hallway
darryl is watching j
is smirking at him
slyly to darryl i like your wife
going after him come back here you little shit
hal and another police officer are restraining darryl
is led off down the hall
louise and thelma pull into a gas station
a gas station attendant approaches as louise and thelma are getting out of the car
to attendant fill her up
to thelma theres a phone right over there
lets get it over with
thelma and louise walk to the phone
im not kidding thelma
if you think he knows even if youre not sure hang up
the tv is on and the place is a mess
darryl hal max and other cops spring into action as the phone rings putting on headsets turning on tape recorders
darryl picks up the phone
hal max etc
all are gesticulating wildly
real friendly thelma
thelma hangs up the phone
matter of factly he knows
everyone is very disappointed taking off their headsets turning off tape recorders and looking at darryl like hes an idiot
darryl still holds the phone in his hand
all i said was hello
thelma and louise are staring at each other intently
louise steps up to the phone
you got any change
thelma digs in her bag and hands louise a roll of quarters
louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone
thelma follows her
she puts the money in and dials
darryl this is louise
are the police there
again everybody springs into action
darryl is fumbling with the phone
no why would any police be here
hey where are you girls anyway
darryl gives hal and max a look as if hes got it completely under control
let me talk to whoevers in charge there
what are you talking about louise
hal comes over and takes the phone away from darryl
hal looks at max who nods take it
hello miss sawyer

maybe over coffee sometime
i just want you to know neither one of you are charged with murder yet
youre still just wanted for questioning
although now mrs
dickinsons wanted in oklahoma for armed robbery
listen we gotta go
ill call you back all right
louise looks at her watch
miss sawyer i dont think yall are gonna make it to mexico
we should talk
i wanna to help you
on hearing this louise mouths the word shit in a very frustrated way
louise hangs up the phone
all are busy trying to see if the call was traced
darryl is back in his recliner still in shock
she is stomping back to the car
thelma follows doggedly
a moving van pulls in and parks in the b
kid is a little shit
louise stops as she is about to get in and faces thelma whos standing on the other side of the car
howd they find out were going to mexico thelma how they know that
you told that thievin little shit where we were goin
louise yanks open her car door gets in and slams the door and fires up the engine
thelma hops in quickly
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up
i asked him not to tell
i didnt think he would tell anybody
whats he got to lose
other than my lifes savings that is
louise careens back onto the road
i mean i
louise slams on the brakes
let me explain something to you
right now we have only two things goin for us
one nobody knows where we are and two nobody knows where were going
now one of our things that was going for us is gone
louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self control
thelma looks pitiful
just stop talkin to people thelma
stop bein so open
were fugitives now
lets behave that way
the t bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like route
where are we
just past boise city
were crossing into new mexico
i always wanted to see new mexico
the car goes streaking by
the large screen tv is on and the room is filled with dense smoke
hal max sit at a table going over paperwork
other plainclothes and surveillance guys play cards
darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly at the tv
jimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes cops sit reading the paper doing the crossword puzzle
over music from tape thelma is sipping on a little wild turkey
now what what
whaddo we do
oh i dont know thelma
i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays
maybe we could have children with the prison guards
im not suggestin that
im not goin back
no matter what happens
so dont worry about me
louise speeds up
thelma hands louise a little bottle of wild turkey and she drinks it down
thelma has one too
can i ask you kind of a weird question
of all the things in the world that scare you whats the worst thing that scares you the most
you mean now or before
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs
what little dogs
you know those little dogs you see people with
like a chihuahua
those too but you know those little hairy ones
those flat faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth
you mean peek a poos
that always put the fear of god in me
what about you
well to be honest the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin to get to me
i can see that
i mean look how different he looks just since high school
its bad enough i have to get old but doin it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse
quieter i mean i dont think hes gonna be very nice about it
well now maybe you wont have to
always lookin on the bright side arent ya
they are driving through monument valley
the t bird speeds through the beautifully moonlit desert
it is almost like daylight
montage of silhouettes of cacti huge rock formations desert beauty shots etc
the sky is bright and expansive and the road goes on forever
this is so beautiful
it sure is
i always wanted to travel
i just never got the opportunity
well you got it now
they both look forward for another moment
and then at the same time they look at each other each taking the other one in completely in this moment
theyre saying everything to each other in this moment but their expressions dont change and they dont say a word
music plays on the radio
a semi gas tanker is up ahead on the road
it looks like the one they saw earlier
its got the same mud flaps
look who it is thelma
ill be darned
whats he doin way out here
just ignore him
louise passes him and as she does he honks
they look up and he is wildly pointing to his lap
i hate this guy
we should have just ignored him
the car is flying down the road
they are quiet for a moment then thelma starts quietly laughing to herself
she is trying to stop but cannot
shaking with laughter nothing
its not funny
whats not funny thelma
thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot
she can barely speak i cant say
thelma isnt making a sound
she is stuck in a convulsion of laughter
gasping for air harlan
what about him
just the look on his face when you
she is falling apart again its not funny
shocked now thelma that is not
thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself
boy he wasnt expectin that
impersonating harlan suck my dick
thelma is laughing wildly
its not funny
thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying
trying to catch her breath i know
they both get quiet
thelma leans back just watching louise
she studies her as if shes never really seen her before
all of a sudden a look of shocked realization comes over thelmas face
she jerks upright and startles louise
carefully it happened to you
louise knows what she is talking about
she becomes immediately agitated
i dont want to talk about it
thelma im not kidding
dont you even
thats what happened
oh my god
louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee
fighting hysteria im warning you thelma
you better drop it right now
i dont want to talk about it
gently okay louise
louises eyes are wild not seeing while thelma now seems completely serene
the car is screaming down the road
they drive through a little stand of buildings
a car speeds up to try and catch them
the red and blue lights pop on
it is a new mexico state patrol car
louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror
louises pov of the speedometer at mph
thelma is asleep
thelma wake up
were gettin pulled over
thelma jumps awake
they are trying not to panic
they are slowing down but still doing mph
the patrol car is right behind them
what do we do
what do you want to do
i dont know
lets just play it by ear
he may not know
he may just give me a ticket
please god please dont let us get caught
please please please
louise pulls the car off the road
the patrol car pulls up right behind them
the lights shine brightly in through the windows
turn off your engine
the patrolman gets out of his car and approaches their car
he comes to the drivers side window
it is rolled up
patrolmans pov of louise smiling up at him
he gestures to her to roll her window down
is there a problem
you wanna let me see your license please
louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet opens it and shows her license
you wanna take it out of your wallet please
she does and hands it to him
i told you to slow down
hell officer i told her to slow down
about how fast was i going
about a hundred and ten
you wanna step out of the car please
they walk to the back of the car
he notes the license plate number
is this your car
you wanna come with me please
walk around and get in the car please
in the back
am i in trouble
as far as im concerned yes maam you are
patrolman gets in the drivers side
he picks up a clipboard and clips louises drivers license to it
he picks up the hand mike for the radio and as he does a hand with a gun comes in his car window
its thelma and she puts the gun to his head
officer i am so sorry about this
could you let go of that
he drops it
i really really apologize but please put your hands on the steering wheel
see if you get on that radio youre gonna find out that were wanted in two states and probably considered armed and dangerous at least i am then our whole
plan would be shot to hell
louise take his gun
louise reaches over and takes his gun
apologetic i am really sorry about this
i swear before yesterday neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this
but if you ever met my husband youd know why i just can
you wanna step out of the car please
she opens the door for him you wanna put your hands on your head please
louise shoot the radio
shoot the radio
louise shoots the car radio
the cop flinches with each shot
the police radio louise
louise fires two shots into the police radio
it blasts all to hell
you wanna step to the back of the car please
louise bring the keys
louise reaches over and takes the keys
she takes her license off the clipboard
she gets out and trots around to the back of the car
thelma is holding the gun on the patrolman
suddenly thelma fires the gun blowing two holes into the trunk cover
to louise open the trunk
louise opens the trunk
to patrolman you wanna step into the trunk please
i got kids
well youre lucky
you be sweet to em
especially your wife
my husband wasnt sweet to me and look how i turned out
now go on get in there
as hes climbing into the trunk thelma explains to louise air holes
hes all the way in and louise closes the trunk
thelma opens the glove compartment
she takes a box of spare ammo and closes it
thelma takes the keys and gets out of the car
she walks around to the trunk
to trunk sorry
from her car sorry
thelma hops into the car with louise
they look at each other
louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away
shaking her head i know its crazy louise but i just feel like ive got a knack for this shit
i believe you
they are in really beautiful country now
drive like hell
hal and max are alone in the kitchen
hal switches on the mr
its just not working like this
we gotta do something
itd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals but jesus hal this is makin us look bad
i dont know
maybe theyre not movin
maybe that little creep lied
hes got nothin to gain by lyin
nothin at all
he already got all their money
i just dont know what were dealin with here
anyway it went out again last night on nationwide teletype
lets just wait it out a little longer
she said she was gonna call back
lets just sit tight
we dont have a whole lotta choice do we
i cant figure out if theyre real smart or just really really lucky
it dont matter
brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out
a cop walks into the kitchen and hands hal a file that says louise elizabeth sawyer on the outside
he opens it up and starts looking through a personal history
one piece of paper is a case file from texas containing an incident report of a rape
stamped across it are the words charges dropped
are we still going to mexico
thelma pauses while she searches for the logic
then arent we going in the wrong direction
well i figure if you take a state policeman shoot up his car take his gun and lock him in the trunk its best to just get on out of
the state if you can
they are both quiet for a second
louise goes a little faster
thelma is digging through her bag
she hands louise a piece of beef jerky
i dont want to see any more beef jerky
i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window
its drivin me crazy
the whole car smells like it
its what the pioneers ate
i dont care what the damn pioneers ate
you just keep that shit away from me now i mean it
thelma puts down her bag
and i dont want any more wild turkey either
its burning a hole in my stomach
ive got some tequila
you want some tequila
yeah you want it
thelma starts to dig through her bag again
its in here somewhere
louise is rubbing her face
she looks pretty bad
her hands are shaking
im gettin tired
are you alright
louise does not really seem alright
i think ive really fucked up
i think ive got us in a situation where we could both get killed
why didnt we just go straight to the police
you know why
you already said
whatd i say again
nobody would believe us
wed still get in trouble
wed still have our lives ruined
and you know what else
that guy was hurtin me
and if you hadnt come out when you did hed a hurt me a lot worse
and probably nothin woulda happened to him
cause everybody did see me dancin with him all night
and they woulda made out like i asked for it
and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now
at least now im havin fun
and im not sorry the son of a bitch is dead
im only sorry that it was you that did it and not me
and if i havent i wanna take this time to thank you louise
thank you for savin my ass
i said all that
no louise you said the first part
i said all the rest
louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get light
thelma is in the bathroom nearby
louise has already dialed and the phone is ringing
the tv drones on in the b
as the phone rings there everyone leaps into action again
max picks up the phone
let me speak to
to hal she wants to talk to you
how are things goin out there
got some kind of snowball effect goin here or somethin
youre still with us though
youre somewhere on the face of the earth
well were not in the middle of nowhere but we can see it from here
louise i almost feel like i know you
youre gettin in deeper every moment youre gone
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident
i do believe you
thats what i want everybody to believe
trouble is it doesnt look like an accident and youre not here to tell me about it
i need you to help me here
louise does not answer
did harlan puckett
through clenched teeth repulsed interrupting no
you want to come on in
louise thinks for a minute
i dont think so
then im sorry
were gonna have to charge you with murder
now do you want to come out of this alive
the surveillance man motions to hal to keep it going
darryl comes in and immediately realizes hal is talking to louise
darryl looks attentively at hal
you know certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind things like incarceration cavity search life imprisonment death by electrocution that sort of thing
so come out alive
i dont know
let us think about that
louise ill do anything
i know whats makin you run
i know what happened to you in texas
louises eyes get wide as she hears this
a finger reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up the phone
she has her finger on the lever
come on louise
dont blow it
she walks away towards the car
louise is still standing there holding the phone
thelma stops and looks at her
louise doesnt move
frustrated hal slams down the phone
he looks over at the surveillance man who nods to say we got it
the whole room reacts excitedly
everyone in the room springs into action
max immediately picks up the phone and hal watches him intently
he mouths the words to max i wanna go emphatically
max slightly shakes his head still of the phone
hal goes charging over to max
you gotta take me there
im the only one shes ever talked to
i dont want anybody losin their heads
you know what happens
the volume gets turned way up and the next thing you know those girls are gonna get shot
max still holding the phone is surprised by this outburst
calmly okay hal okay
louise is still standing there
youre not gonna give up on me are ya
what do you mean
youre not gonna make some deal with that guy are you
i mean i just wanna know
im not gonna make any deals
i can understand if youre thinkin about it
i mean in a way youve got something to go back for
i mean jimmy and everything
louise is surprised to be hearing this from thelma
thelma that is not an option
but i dont know
somethings crossed over in me and i cant go back
i mean i just couldnt live
i know what you mean
i dont wanna end up on the damn geraldo show
they are both quiet for a moment
he said theyre charging us with murder
making a face eeuww
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive
gosh didnt he say anything positive at all
louise starts the car
they lurch into reverse then screech forward as they tear off down the road
as they fly down the road
louise do you think we should change cars get another car
you know how to hotwire a car
well let me know when you figure it out
a car pulls up on an airstrip and stops next to a small jet
hal and max get out of the car and board the plane
montage of driving shots as louise and thelma drive through the intense beauty of the arizona desert
you could call it that
my eyes are open
i feel awake
i dont remember ever feelin this awake
everything looks different
you know what i mean
i know you know what i mean
everything looks new
do you feel like that
like youve got something to look forward to
louise and thelma both get quiet for a second
well be drinkin margaritas by the sea mamasita
we can change our names
we can live in a hacienda
i wanna get a job
i wanna work at club med
now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that
itd have to be pretty good
it would have to be pretty damn good
they are both laughing
the car is still flying down the road
the sun is coming higher in the sky now
they come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere
louise stops and looks at the map
we should head a little further in
theres not that many roads in this state
i want to try to hit mexico somewhere not so close to new mexico
they probably wanna kill us in new mexico
louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road
louise and thelma are singing along to a wild r b song
they do the hand movements as if they are the supremes
they come roaring up on the semi tanker the same one they have seen three times before
screaming over music oh my god
see if thats him
hes got california plates
its the same guy
louise bears down really hard and passes him
again as they get right next to him he blows kisses down at them
he is leering at them and laughing
louise and thelma drive further down the road
louise pulls the car off to the side of the road
as the truck gets close they start waving to him to stop
he pulls his truck off the side of the road and stops
angle on louise and thelma smiling up at him
he chuckles to himself
he leans out the window
how are you
they turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop
the trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed full of condoms
he grabs a few and shoves them in his pocket
he turns off his engine and gets out of the truck
he walks up to the car
louise and thelma get out of the car

we think you should apologize
he is getting a little panicky
im not apologizing for shit

louise pulls the gun they stole from the state patrolman
say youre sorry or well make you fuckin sorry
he looks at the gun
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio didnt you
i hate that
i hate bein called a beaver dont you
are you going to apologize or not
louise looks at his truck off in the distance
she points the gun at it takes a second to get a bead then shoots two of the tires flat
the truck slowly sinks as the air escapes from the tires
louise and thelma look at each other
they both turn towards the truck and fire rounds into the tankers until they explode in a huge ball of fire
the truck driver screams at the top of his lungs
louise starts the car and starts driving in circles around the truck driver
thelma and louise are both howling at the top of their lungs
thelma is sitting on the back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard
you fucking bitch
youre gonna have to pay for that
im gonna make you pay for that
you hear me
louise stops the car right next to him
louise takes off again and thelma falls into the back seat
they drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust
louise drives through the desert back towards the road past the burning debris of the truck
as she gets to the road she stops
thelma climbs into the front seat
whered you learn to shoot like that
you were right about what happened to me there
they pull away from the burning wreckage
as thelma and louise talk their voices are heard over the following scene
you know whats happened dont you
smiling weve gone insane
a battered old pickup truck is parked by the new mexico state patrol
an old man uses a crowbar to pry open the trunk
the new mexico state patrolman hops out of the trunk
police bulletin voice over begins and plays over following scenes a police helicopter flies over the burning wreckage of the fuel truck
the truck driver is waving his arms as the helicopter descends blowing dirt all over him
darryl sits practically comatose in a big chair
his eyes have a dull glaze as he stares first at one wall then another
a tight shot of a tape being shoved into the cassette deck
max and hal sit next to each other in the jet
hal tries to appear as if hes used to all this
max holds a cellular phone to his ear
tight shot of max as we hear through the phone police voice over becomes part of scene
on phone abducted
shot up the car
stole the officers weapon
maxs face becomes troubled and more serious than weve seen so far
he looks at hal as he hangs up the phone
youre not even going to believe this
the jet banks off to the left
wide shot of car speeding through the desert on an empty highway west
driving shot thelma has her face to the sun with her eyes closed
louise is driving with a fierce intensity
they hardly resemble the two women that started out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier
although their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades
hal and max are climbing out of the jet and running across the tarmac to a waiting helicopter
max is carrying a walkie talkie now
thelma sits up suddenly
an arizona police car passes them going eastbound
do you think he saw us
i dont know but lets get off
the police car cuts across the median to begin pursuit of the girls
the lights are flashing
is your seat belt on
thelma puts her seat belt on
louise floors the car and it streaks off putting some distance between them and the police car
thelma looks back at the police car
she looks scared
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught
were not gonna get caught
state policeman is on his radio
in pursuit of a green t bird license seven one nine william zebra adam
breaks up armed and extremely dangerous
a steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running to their cars still parked in the lot
how far are we from mexico
about two hundred and fifty miles
how long do you think thatll take
there are now two police cars behind them about half a mile back
they are going really fast
a police helicopter catches up to them and orders them to stop
thelma stands and flips them off
were going to mexico
looking back uh oh
theres another one
louise and thelma both are looking back at the two police cars following them
they turn back around just in time to see a third arizona state police car has pulled into the middle of an intersection of the only road that crosses it
they both scream
louise swerves just in time to keep from hitting it broadside
she goes off the road and has to struggle to pull her car back onto the road leaving a huge cloud of dust
did you see that guy
he was right in the middle of the road
the first two police cars are approaching the same intersection
they are driving side by side
there is still a huge cloud of dust that now covers the third car in the middle of the intersection
a huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches the intersection
it clears to reveal the third police car in the middle of the road just as he and police car reach the intersection
angle on policeman as he screams and swerves to the right
right for him at mph
he screams and ducks down into the seat
swerves to the right
police car swerves to the left both barely missing police car
another angle as police car and police car both pull back onto the road right next to each other
policeman sits up in the seat
he cant believe he isnt dead
he puts his car in gear and takes off down the road after them
looking in rearview mirror shit
what dyou think
louise and thelma blow through a stand of buildings left from when the train went through here
there are two parallel streets on either side of the one theyre on and as they pass by buildings they can see police cars roaring down these parallel streets trying
to head them off at the pass
louise floors it and her car screams ahead
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck
theyll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas
i know this whole thing was my fault
i know it is
theres one thing you oughta understand by now thelma its not your fault
no matter what happens im glad i came with you
louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the desert
all the police cars take off across the desert after them
they are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars
youre a good friend
you too sweetie the best
i guess i went a little crazy huh
youve always been crazy
this is just the first chance youve had to really express yourself
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty
unbearable id imagine
i guess everything weve got to lose is already gone anyway
how do you stay so positive
it does look like an army
more police cars have joined and from every direction police cars are swarming across the desert although none are in front of them
way off in the distance a helicopter joins the chase
thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance
what in the hell is that up there
way up ahead
louise strains to see
whatever it is louise is barreling towards it the car leaving the ground as they fly through the desert
oh my god
louise starts to laugh and cry at the same time
what in the hell is it
its the goddamn grand canyon
behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police cars following them
in front of them looking larger every moment is the awesome splendor of the grand canyon
isnt it beautiful
louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes there is absolutely no escape
she continues barreling towards it without slowing down
all the police cars are still following about a half a mile behind
the car is bouncing and flying across the desert
finally they get about twenty yards from the edge and louise slams on the brakes
thelma and louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up
the police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind them
the dust from the cars is blowing across them
they just sit looking at the grand canyon
from the canyon the fbi helicopter rises up in front of the car
hal sees thelma and louise for the first time
they are sitting in the car oblivious in a way to all the activity around them
he only takes his eyes off of them long enough to look at max
it looks like the army
all this for us
thelma starts to laugh
louise is only concerned with missing the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her
the helicopter lands behind the row of police cars
he sees thelma and louise facing each other
they look so nice
he cant stop looking
he borrows the binoculars from max
he sees thelma and louise in the car
some of the police sharpshooters are sporting semi automatic rifles
hal looks at max
dont let them shoot those girls
this is too much
they got guns pointed at em
the women are armed hal
this is standard
now you stay calm here
these boys know what theyre doin
max climbs out of the chopper
hal sits for a moment and then leaps out and follows max
over loudspeaker this is the arizona highway patrol
you are under arrest
you are considered armed and dangerous
any failure to obey any command will be considered an act of aggression against us
were not giving up thelma
then lets not get caught
what are you talkin about
indicating the grand canyon go
thelma is smiling at her
they look at each other look back at the wall of police cars and then look back at each other
being loaded into automatic rifle
two of the arizona cops by their cars as they are loading weapons talk quietly
heard they shot a cop
with his own gun
put him in the trunk and blew him away
louise and thelma are looking at each other
over loudspeaker turn off the engine and place your hands in the air
hal is about to crawl out of his skin
he cant believe this thing is getting out of control
he jumps in front of max
let me talk to em
i cant believe this
youve gotta do something here
max goes around hal and continues walking
hal jumps in front of max again and blocks his way
im sorry to bother you i know youre real busy right now but how many times max
how many times has that woman gotta be fucked over
you could lift one finger and save her ass and you wont even do that
grabbing hal get a hold of yourself
you are way out of your jurisdiction now come on
dont make me sorry i let you come
max lets go of hals lapels
under his breath shit
i cant fucking believe this
hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face
hes shaking his head
slowly he breaks into a trot and starts heading toward the front line
hal is running now and clears the front row of cars
there is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front row
some shout some lower their guns to look
what in the hell
lowering his rifle the son of a bitch is in my way
they are still looking at each other really hard
youre a good friend
you too sweetie the best
king song entitled better not look down begins
it is very upbeat
are you sure
louise puts the car in gear and floors it
hals eyes widen for a moment at what he sees and then a sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word alright
ive been around ive seem some things people movin faster than the speed of sound faster than a speedin bullet
people livin like superman all day and all night
i wont say if its wrong or i wont say if its right
im pretty fast myself
but i do have some advice to pass along right here in the words to this song
the cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and disbelief cover their faces
a cloud of dust blows through the frame as the speeding car sails over the edge of the cliff
better not look down if you wanna keep on flyin
put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
better not look back or you might just wind up cryin
you can keep it movin if you dont look down
