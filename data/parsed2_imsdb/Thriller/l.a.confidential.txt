the kleig lights are out front
valets hurry to park a line of elegant cars

a christmas party in full swing
eating drinking and dancing

you like it jackie boy
yeah its subtle
sid hands him a president grant
remember you heard it first here off the record on the q
and very hush hush suspects mostly drunk and disorderly are ushered through
ed exley bespectacled is at the desk with a young officer
exley is an up and comer
burning with ambition
the faster he rises through the ranks the more resentment he leaves in his wake
whats on the call sheet
a guy dressed as santa has been exposing himself to kids in los feliz
apparently sir hes decorated himself
with tinsel and plastic icicles and
on his penis sir
i get the idea
you got a description
of his penis sir
tinsel trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the walls as the owner takes an order from lynn bracken
a case each of gin scotch and rum
everything top shelf
none of that watered down stuff you push on errol flynn
laughs sounds like a helluva party
her hair kerchiefed lynn waits as the owner writes it up
theres glamour a cat girl grace about lynn
she seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars
lynn looks across as bud white heads toward the counter
spotting her bud doesnt look so tough for a moment
you want it delivered
before five tomorrow
the owner spots bud
a big smile turns to a frown
ill be right with you lynn
the owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor into a cardboard box leaving bud and lynn to look at each other
bud says the only thing he can think of
merry christmas yourself officer that obvious huh
smiles sweetly its practically stamped on your forehead
as the owner bangs a case of liquor on the counter
bud exits with his booze heads for the car
something catches his eye
a woman in the rear passenger seat of a new cadillac
both her eyes are black
bud starts over
the case on his hip he motions for her to roll down the window
the drivers side door opens and bodyguard turner buzz meeks menaces his way out
get lost why dont you
meeks stops short as bud shoves his badge in meeks face
setting the case on the cars hood bud spins meeks around pats him down
he finds a
in a shoulder holster
i got a license for that
bud removes meeks wallet checks the id
cut me some slack
i used to be a cop
never heard of you
exiting store we just call him buzz
bud raps on susans window with his badge
it comes down
beside her a man leans over
pierce patchett seen before at the freeway unveiling is a man used to being chauffeured
like fdr he smokes his cigarette in a holder
menacing im not asking you
patchett has no idea hes walking on thin ice
as he stares impatiently at bud bud looks back to susan
somebody hit you
its not what you think
bud looks to see lynn bracken moving to the drivers door
what is it then
you got the wrong idea mister
patchett eases back into the shadows
getting in the car but its nice to know you care
bud considers meeks gun license then hands him back the and wallet
lifting his booze bud watches meeks get back in the car
stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away
whats going on
for an odd moment stensland and meeks lock eyes
you know him
seen him around
he used to be a cop
fifty handsome in his police captains uniform
singing silver bells in a beautiful low tenor
tough respected dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his life
hes a department power to be reckoned with
herald express reporter and photographer listen along with the gathered patrolmen as dudley finishes to applause
dudley joins the press
captain smith i drop the formalities its christmas eve
call me dudley
dudley i came up with a title for the story
im calling it silent night with the l
dramatic pause the sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element
our vigilance will not be diminished
as the reporter scribbles down the quote
thats smith with an s
dudley points the way out
this way gentlemen
dudleys the last one out the door
as he goes he turns back to give the men a wink
hes no sooner out the door when the first case of johnny walker is brought in
ed exley gets another report from the young officer
two police officers were assaulted in a bar
brown and helenowski
he hands the report to exley
its now that dudley comes through on his press junket
this is sergeant ed exley
son of the legendary preston exley
hes the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job
as the photographer snaps exleys picture
i was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when i was a rookie
it makes a man feel old
thats a fact
a beat feel free to get a feel for the place
as the reporter and photographer wander off dudley turns to exley a bit more serious
a word with you lad
dudley pours two drinks hands one to exley
to the memory of your father
exley looks to a photo on the wall
himself as a ten year old standing between dudley and his father preston both in police uniform
the day he got the medal of valor
a simpler time
remembering exley invokes his fathers favorite toast
to the solving of crimes that require absolute justice
exley raises his glass but dudley just watches him
that was his favorite toast
a beat i saw the test results on the lieutenants exam
you placed first out of twenty three
the youngest applicant by eight years
youll make lieutenant inside a year
i was thinking detective bureau
we can see dudley doesnt approve
you dont have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective
or the stomach
youre a political animal edmund
the criticism stings but dudleys a straight shooter
would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment
dudley weve been over this
answer yes or no
would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorneys working hypothesis
yes or no edmund
would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty
would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance no
then for gods sake dont be a detective
stick to assignments where you wont have to make those choices
patrol internal affairs but not the bureau
i know you mean well dudley but i dont need to do it the way you did
or my father
at least get rid of the glasses
i cant think of one bureau man who wears them
a large impromptu bar has been set up
the party is in full swing the floor packed with nightwatch blues
a stensland pours eggnog and old crow into the water cooler as bud elbows his way in with another case
grab a cup
i got to write my report first
hear about helenowski and brown
they got into a helluva scrap with six taco benders at some bar
helenowski lost six pints of blood
browns in a coma
we ought to teach paco and his friends a lesson
more cops vocie their agreement
bottles are passed
only bud doesnt seem as caught up as the rest
jack vincennes at his desk
holding the fleur de lis card jack dials the number
a corkboard on the wall is posted with press clippings
dope crusader wounded in shootout
actor mitchum seized in marijuana shack raid
that one includes a shot of jack ushering mitchum into jail
over phone like silk whatever you desire
id like to get a delivery to beverly hills
over phone i dont think i know you
the line goes dead
over phone whatever you desire
look a friend of mine gave me this number
i just the line goes dead again
jack dials a new number
filtered pacific coast bell
this is sgt
requesting a name and address on a phone number
hollywood zero one two three nine
filtered please hold the line
no such number is assigned
i just called it
i checked twice
realizes hangs up a bootleg
exley surveys the carousing rowdies
raising his voice
all right men
youve had your fun
time to break it up
the party continues undiminished
from across the room stensland eyes exley with disdain
guys got a pole so far up his ass every time he farts the flag waves
the command not really his exley reads a report ignores the party though his window looks into the thick of it
suddenly a ripple goes through the room
the men begin to push out through a rear door
exley stands stops a whats going on
they got the spics who japped helenowski and brown
helenowski lost an eye and browns got brain damage
i have the report right here
theyre home with bruises and muscle pulls oh shit
exley starts out after them
stensland in the lead
pulling out a blackjack he enters cell begins wailing on one of the mexicans dinardo
for ours pancho
and youre getting off easy
cheered on by drunks in the tank and his fellow officers stensland goes wild
hes joined by lentz crumley and tristano
shaking his head jack vincennes moves away
bud types his report with one finger
jack looks in
white you better get a lease on stens before he kills someone
followed by jack bud forces his way through the crowd
the men who see its him quickly clear a path
swigging from a pint of gin stensland works skinny garcia
the kid drops to his knees drooling blood
bud grabs stensland hauls him off of garcia who looks up
fuck you pendejo yeah yeah
and fuck your mother too
bud sees red
letting go of stensland bud white picks up garcia by the neck
there are cheers attaboys and holy fucks as bud bangs garcias head on the ceiling
arriving stop officer
thats an order
cops block exleys way
as bud looks over garcia kicks him in the balls
a dangling shot
bud keels into the bars garcia stumbles out of the cell smack into jack
jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer then puts garcia down with a left right
exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket
youre going in my report
all of you
exley has just started taking names when bud grabs him by the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into
as exley struggles a cop opens the door to the store room
bud slings exley inside then slams the door tight
exley is locked in
as bud moves off we hear let me out
thats an order
the herald reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed
stensland swings like a madman
thats when a flashbulb goes off
freezing everyone in black and white
the chief sits behind a desk in a four star uniform
dudley smith sits to his left d
ellis loew to his right
seen earlier at the mickey cohen press conference loew is the only civilian
bud white stands across from them
there to be judged
officer white youve refused to cooperate with internal affairs
but you should know this is bigger than a police board
indictments may be handed down
quite frankly we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the departments image
will you testify
bud glances to a gray tinted mirror then to the chief
the chief sighs looks to loew
district attorney loew
loew steps to bud holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo
the headline bloody christmas
the press love to label
you and officer stensland brought the liquor into the precinct
stensland was already drunk
do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage youve done to yourself
i wont do it
staring at mirror i wont testify against my partner or anyone else
this man is a disgrace
your badge and gun officer
bud sets them on the chiefs desk
this is the new l
youre suspended from duty and dismissed
turning white shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out
dudley smith hides a smile
exley watches involuntarily leans back as bud passes on the other side of the glass
dudley loew and the chief wait as exley enters
ed your observations have been astute
whats your assessment of this situation
the public demands justice sir
this was a full fledged riot of policemen
shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured
force them to retire
but someone has to swing
indict try and convict stensland and bud white
secure them jail time
feed them to the sharks sir
protect yourself protect the department
dudley gives exley a look
hes angry with him
stenslands a disgrace
straight d fitness reports from every c
he ever served under
but white is a valuable officer
whites a mindless thug
hes a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time
the chief interrupts with his own concern
i want to know who we give the public in contrast
the department needs role models
clean cut forthright men the public can admire
ill testify sir
im not afraid to do whats right
and ill promote you
youll be a lieutenant immediately
exley seizes the moment going over dudleys head
the chief and dudley exchange a look
your father didnt make lieutenant until he was
i know that sir
i also know that when he made lieutenant it was as a detective
interrupting before we start polishing our laurels it would look better if we had a corroborative witness
thatll be hard to come by
the men hate a turncoat
hes the technical advisor on badge of honor sir
he lives for it
thats the way to get him
all right ed
into desk intercom call sergeant vincennes
as exley starts out dudley pulls him aside speaks low
youll reap the benefits but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department
so be it
looking sharp he strides down the hall enters the
centred on jack
exley is gone
sergeant well get right to it
nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting ezekiel garcia
but my office has a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit
what do i have to do
testify against the three officers who have already earned their pensions
our key witness will testify roundly but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men
ill guarantee you a slap on the wrist
a brief suspension followed by a temporary transfer from narcotics to ad vice
a beat when you transfer out of vice youll be back on the show
the show sir
badge of honor vincennes
we need to tone down your profile for a bit
the chief just got jack where he lives
john i doubt youve ever drawn a stupid breath
dont start now
ill do it
smiles all around
loew smiles at the two way
a move not lost on jack who wonders who might be on the other side
the chief steps to the mirror looks through
so be it
exley clenches his fist in victory
the chief continues
ace them at the grand jury tomorrow son
wear the smart looking suit and ace them
lose the glasses
glasses off exley waits looks up as jack enters
youre the key witness
i shouldve known
whats the chief throwing you
throwing me yeah exley
whats the payoff
youre the payoff expert
im just doing my duty
youre playing an angle college boy
youre getting something out of this so you dont have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops wholl hate your guts for snitching
if theyre making you a detective watch out
some bureau guys are gonna burn in this and youre gonna have to work with friends of theirs
what about you
im snitching three old timers wholl be fishing in oregon next week
next to you im clean
at that a clerk steps in from the hallway
exley to chambers
as exleys about to go
just remember bud whitell fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life
they already suspended him
just pray he cops a deal and stays on the department because that is one civilian you do not want on your case
an old black guy in a frayed threadbare tux plays piano
bud nursing a highball at the bar steps over to a redhead with too much make up on too many miles
that an old fashioned youre drinking
as she nods my names bud
nobody was born with the name bud
they stick you with a name like wendell you look for an alias
what do you do bud
im sorta between jobs
look what do you say we uh
a hand on buds shoulder
he turns to see dudley smith
lad may i have a word with you
this business captain
say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables
dudley starts off
bud turns back to redhead but shes already talking to a sailor
dudley sits at a table
a newspaper is opened a little mound underneath
bud joins dudley
does that paper say weve been indicted
does it say exleys a hero for squealing me and stensland off
he made his play amd he got what he wanted
theyre making him a detective
captain what do you want
call me dudley
dudley what do you want
lad i admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner
i admire you as a policeman particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job
and i am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters
do you hate them wendell
looks away yeah i hate them
and for good reason judging from what i know of your background
bud looks back over
dudleys getting too personal
whats going to happen to stensland
hell give himself cirrhosis over this
hes one year from his pension it wouldve happened years ago if you hadnt carried him
why the loyalty wendell
he helped me out once
your partners through
department scapegoat on the chiefs orders
hes been billed hell be indicted and hell swing
him and me both
fucking exley dont underestimate his skills
as a politician he exceeds even myself
but the department needs smart men like exley and
direct men like yourself what do you want wendell i want you to come to work for me
mowing your fucking lawn
smith yanks the newspaper revealing buds badge
bud cant believe his eyes
i knew you had juice but
theres no goddamn bill on me
four of the defendants recanted their testimony
dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand
i need you for an assignment the chiefs given me the go ahead on
a duty few men are fit for but you were born for
youll be working out of homicide
your talents lie elsewhere wendell
its a muscle job and shooting job
youll do what i say and not ask questions
do you follow my drift
disappointed in technicolor
will you work for me
how what wendell
howd you get them to retract
dudley lays brass knuckles on the table
theyre chipped caked with blood

accompanied by bud dick stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box
well wishing cops pat him on the back offer words of encouragement but stensland looks like hes going to cry
its very bad timing as exley enters comes face to face with them
this is hatred
acting on impulse bud goes after exley
its a mauling
four vicious body shots
a potentially lethal head shot sails wide as exley falls to the ground
as four men move to hold bud back exley looks up at him
gasping youre just a thug white
thats all youll ever be
dudley steps into the fray
he helps exley to his feet
you should stay away from a man when his blood is up
his bloods always up
four cops are genuinely having trouble holding bud back
dudley watches with something bordering on admiration
then maybe you should stay away from him all the time
accompanied by bud stensland reaches his car loads his box of stuff into the trunk
bud is moody pensive
dont look so down in the mouth bud
you nailed him good
i got a couple of hours before i have to be at the victory
want to grab a beer
rain check me partner
i got something big going on tonight
that new mystery girl youve been seeing
ill tell you sometime
dont want to jinx it
but it could take the edge off that jail time i got coming
what are you talking about
its confidential bud
like that magazines vincennes scams for
hush hush smiles ill see you tomorrow
and hey if it works out youll get a piece of it
stensland gets in the car drives off
bud is left alone
exley sits alone in a sea of desks
the squawk box drones
exley squints at the clock on the wall cant make it out
he takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket
finally something to do
he walks to the wall calendar tears off feb
to reveal mar
as exley sits the call squawk box booms to life
nite owl coffee shop one eight one two four cherokee
blues setting up a crime scene blockade
exley pulls up douses his siren
patrolman runs over
loads of people down
i stopped for coffee exley pushes him aside heads for the door
its wide open
exley takes mental snapshots
ten stools front a counter
the side wall mural papered winking owls perched on street signs
on the right a string of tables
three in disarray
food spilled dishes broken
a high heel pump by an upended chair
heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back toward the kitchen
past an open empty cash register
crisscrossed drag marks connect lead to a walk in
blood soaked bodies on the floor
five maybe six in a tangle
dozens of shotgun shells float in the pools of blood
as exley struggles to maintain his composure
holy shit fuck
exley looks at a green faced rookie in the locker doorway
s s sir theres a captain outside wants to see you
dont get sick
not in here
exley shoves the rookie puking out the door
patrolmen hold back a swarm of reporters and rubber neckers
motorcycles run interference for meat wagons cut off by the crown
as ed emerges reporters surge shout questions
exley hurries past finds dudley in command and barking orders
sir i took the call
its my case
edmund you dont want it and you cant have it
yes i do sir
ill make you my second in command
exley spots a photographer moving in
he looks properly serious as the flash bulb pops
forensics chief ray pinker walks exley and dudley through
we got a total of forty five spent gauge remington shotgun shells
three men with five shot capacity pumps
all of them reloading twice
we need to canvass
see if a purple mercury was seen around here tonight
we got a call earlier on three negro youths
firing shotguns in griffith park from a late model purple mercury coupe
to his adjutant get on it
a forensics cop approaches pinker
we got an i
on one of the victims sir
i think its dick stensland
exley and dudley react look at each other
set in a no mans land of bulldozed homes
a sign proudly announces the impending arrival of the freeway
the motel is surrounded by a barbed wire fence
abandoned but for a pair of lapd cars and a light burning in room
an unmarked pulls up and exley and dudley step out
they start forward but a scream inside stops exley short
with mickey cohen in prison los angeles is organized crime free
the chief wants it to stay that way edmund
the means are not for the weak hearted
a table and chair bolted to the floor
a tough flat nosed gangster is cuffed to the hot seat
on the table are a
and a fat roll of bills
breuning and carlisle watch as bud white delivers a couple of short stiff body shots
flatnose is not used to being on the receiving end
all the same we get the idea buds a bit reluctant
buds back is to dudley and exley who enter behind him
come wendell you can do better than that
bud turns sees exley and dudley
as bud looms over flatnose the gangster babbles
i know things
i hear things
like with the mick inside things are on this weird slowdown
these shooter teams bang bang bang theyre ing mickey cohens men
we know all that lad
tell us who do these shooters work for
i dont know
no one knows
maybe theyre mavericks
you want a prostie roust
some narco action
breaking down what do you want
we want you to go home
to breuning uncuff him michael
dudley turns to exley
sifakis is a known loan shark from san francisco
he arrived this afternoon at union station
looking for business opportunities in our fair city
an organized crime associate in need of re education in the ways of polite society
uncuffed flatnose rubs his wrists
as breuning steps back flatnose snatches the
off the table
exley dives for cover but the other four cops just stand there
dudley looks down on the floor at exley
its part of the play edmund
a sincerity test
flatnose looks at the gun a beat then squeezes the trigger
to breuning sit him back down
they shove flatnose back in the hot seat
dudley offers a hand to exley helps him to his feet
wendell you need to accompany detective lieutenant exley on official police business
ill finish up here
they drive in silence
no love lost here
where are we going
its a surprise
you like surprises dont you white
exley pulls up
bud looks to him
really curious now
exley and bud walk
an orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall
the orderly wheels the body in to the examination room
as bud and exley pass the coroner pulls back the sheet is surprised at the sight of a woman who we dont quite see
call me crazy but for a second i thought it was rita hayworth
exley and bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroners assistant waits
we need you to i
theres no next of kin and you knew him best
so tell me
the assistant pulls open drawer
a naked man
a tag on his toe and half his face blown off
is that dick stensland
stunned bud stares at whats left of his old partner
yeah thats stens
hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence
buds torn between wanting to smash exley and finding out why stensland is dead
he squeezes out the words
someone held up a coffee shop panicked and killed six people
then from the hall
not my baby
not my little girl
hilda lefferts enters with the coroner to id the body of her daughter susan
theres stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders but a sheet hides the real damage
its the girl bud saw outside hollywood liquor
without the black eyes she does look like rita hayworth
as bud and exley appear mrs
lefferts looks confused
is this your daughter mrs
i i dont know
we know this is difficult
just take your time and look again
exley doesnt realize but bud recognizes the deceased
it seems like my susan but
when was the last time you saw her mrs
we had fought
i didnt like her boyfriend
i she has a birthmark on her hip
the coroner lifts the sheet
lefferts swoons bud and exley both hold her up
the room buzzes jammed to the rafters with every detective standing ready
the chief waits as dudley smith takes the mike holds up an l
nite owl massacre
hyperbole aside this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution
the public will demand it and this department will provide it
one of them one of our own dick stensland
as the cops react as it happens he was a nite owl regular
in the wrong place at the wrong time
bud white listens not too sure
stensland said he had something big going on
robbery looks like the motive
we have rubber glove prints on the register and preliminary forensics strongly lean toward a trio of gunmen
we do have one hot lead so listen well
three negro youths were seen last night discharging shotguns in the air at griffith park
a park ranger i
ed them as driving a to mercury coupe purple in color
an hour ago a canvassing crew found a news vendor who saw a purple merc coupe parked across from the nite owl around a
the room goes loud a big rumbling
dudley holds up a list
worked all night to get us a registration list on to purple mercs
there are registered to negroes in l
fifty two man teams will shake three names apiece
hot suspects youll bring here
interrogation rooms have been set up
theyll be run by lieutenant edmund exley
the chief steps to the mike
enough on that
gentlemen just go out and get them
use all necessary force
the people of los angeles demand it
the men exchange knowing looks
the real message kill them clean
exley doesnt approve
as the men hurry out
he might as well have put a bounty on them
detectives pairing up and moving out
scanning his three name list bud joins his partner for the day
can you take them
i got i got something i gotta do
christ i dont know
what if one of these names
what i gotta do is for stensland
the guy looks at him a beat nods
as bud heads off
watches everyone go
wishes he could be part of the action
he spots jack talking to his redneck partner for for the day
redneck chews tobacco has a texas drawl
where to trash
if we go by the list we have about zero chance of making the collar
but i know a guy who knows whats going on south of jefferson
im betting he could put us at
i dont know
as redneck thinks exley steps up
ill take those odds
to redneck take off
we got it from here
redneck shrugs spits tobacco juice in a cup
between the two of you guys you should bring along a photographer
last time we saw the owner was christmas eve
he looks up from a customer as bud strides in badge out front
i need an address on a customer of yours
her name was lynn
thats all i have to go on
and i think you already know who i mean so cough it up
theres a billing address and a delivery address
give me both
a big pink spanish mansion with lots of tile
also last seen outside hollywood liquor on christmas eve pierce patchett is in the front yard chipping golf balls over a koi pond
they land in a tight grouping
as he tees up you must slay em at the country club
buds halfway up the walk
patchett sees the cuffs hooked to his belt
patchett is cool as can be
are you pierce patchett
are you soliciting for police charities
the last time you people called at my office
im a homicide detective
where were you last night
i was here hosting a party
who was killed and why do you think i can help
i dont know him
how about susan lefferts
you know her
sighs concedes you know i do or you wouldnt be here
how did you find me
we met outside hollywood liquors on christmas eve
this is where lynn brackens booze bills go
sue lefferts died at the nite owl
patchett studies bud a beat weighing his options
patchetts burly bodyguard starts over from the house
everything alright mr
waves him off fine philip
wheres the other guy
he no longer works for me
a beat find susans killer mr
ill give you a handsome reward
whatever you desire if only jack had been around to hear that
thanks but no thanks
against your code
i dont have one
lefferts looked beat up christmas eve but didnt act it
do you care about criminal matters peripheral to susans murder
then you wouldnt feel obligated to report them
then listen closely because ill only say this once and if it gets repeated ill deny it
i run call girls
lynn bracken is one of them and so was susan lefferts
i treat my girls very well
i have grown daughters myself and i dont like the thought of women being hurt
i sense you share this feeling
ignores comment why were lefferts eyes black
i think shed been hit in the face with a tennis racket
she is was a big doubles fan
you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially
our deal still holds
bud nods his patience running thin
i needed a rita hayworth to fill out my little studio
what little studio
theres gardner hepburn grable turner
lynn bracken is my veronica lake
i use girls who look like movie stars
sometimes i employ a plastic surgeon
thats why her mother couldnt i
jesus fucking christ
pierce morehouse patchett
now i sense youre on your best behavior but thats all ill give you
if you persist ill meet you with my attorney
now would you like miss brackens address
i doubt she knows anything but i got her address
this is personal with you isnt it mr
bud turns heads down the walk
patchett hits his golf ball
it lands just past the koi pond with the rest
a modern looking triplex
a projectors flicker strobes against the closed curtains
we hear a phone ring
the film is this gun for hire with alan ladd and veronica lake
its projected on a wall in front of which stands lynn bracken and an older gentleman in his underwear
lynns long blonde hair hangs down over one eye
she looks more like veronica lake than veronica lake
the film flashes over them as they kiss
the phone rings
lynn ignores it as long as she can before breaking away to go answer it
alan ladd is it the cops
she waves him off
as he practices pointing his finger like ladd points a gun lynn reacts to the news on the phone
a south central plywood and tar paper dive
a black boxer pounds a heavy bag speed bag combo bolted to the porch
wiry a welterweight he doesnt see jack and exley till theyre almost on top of him
the boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath
looking them over he finally nods
hows the left these days
whats it to you
i saw you fight kid gavilan
i like your style
what do you want mr
you got a brother up in folsom
i know because i put him there
howd you like to make it
i know the judge and sergeant exley here is friends with hte d
exley nods this is true
the boxers still listening
were looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns
one of em owns a purple merc coupe
you wanna get me a fuckin snitch jacket
you wanna buy your brother ten years
you dont have to say anything
just look at this list and point
jack holds the dmv list out to the boxer who waves it off
hes bad so ill just tell you
sugar ray coates
drives a coupe a beautiful ride
dont know about shotguns but he gets his thrills killing dogs
he is righteous trash
jack and exley scan the list
jacks finger stabs down on coates raymond south central room
thats five minutes from here
lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled older gentleman out the door
i dont understand doll we just got started
im sorry but ill make it up to you
gosh kitten i dont know
as he begins to mash up against her
hit the road gramps
buds standing at the bottom of the stairs
the older gentleman strikes a pose
he still thinks hes alan ladd
this time ill go but next time flips badge l
get the fuck out of here or ill call your wife to come get you
sputtering the older gentleman exchanges a look with lynn then hurries away giving bud a wide berth
ive been expecting you
told me what happened to sue
a nice breezy feel
the perfect place to shack up
its officer white isnt it
bud nods eyeballs the place
can i get you a drink
yeah plain scotch
bud watches her move to the bar
god shes beautiful
i was friendly with sue lefferts but we werent really friends
you know what i mean
are you sorry shes dead
of course i am
what kind of question is that
she steps back with a scotch for both of them
have you ever heard of dick stensland
no i havent
do you know why pierce is humoring you
you use words like that you might make me mad
but do you know
yeah i know
patchetts running whores and judging by his address probably something bigger on the side
he doesnt want any attention
our motives are selfish so were cooperating
why was susan lefferts at the nite owl
i dont know
i never heard of the nite owl till today
did lefferts have a boyfriend
like i said we were friendly not friends
howd she meet patchett
pierce meets people
sue came on the bus with dreams of hollywood
this is how they turned out
thanks to pierce we still get to act a little
tell me about patchett
hes waiting for you to mention mention
you want some advice miss bracken
miss bracken dont ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or ill have you and patchett in shit up to your ears
lynn smiles again
she likes bud
i remember you from christmas eve
you have a thing for helping women dont you officer white
maybe im just fucking curious
you say fuck a lot
you fuck for money
theres blood on your shirt
is that an integral part of your job
do you enjoy it
when they deserve it
did they deserve it today
im not sure
but you did it anyway
yeah just like the half dozen guys you screwed today
laughs again actually it was two
youre different officer white
youre the first man in five years who didnt tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute
you look better than veronica lake
now pierce patchett he takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us
he makes us quit the life at thirty
he doesnt let us use narcotics and he doesnt abuse us
can your policemans mentality grasp those contradictions
he had you cut to look like veronica lake
im really a brunette but the rest is me
and thats all the news thats fit to print
lynn starts toward the door
bud watches her a moment then follows
she takes his glass at the door
it was nice meeting you officer
out the door bud turns back
i want to see you again
are you asking me for a date or an appointment
suddenly unsure i dont know
another smile if its a date i think youd better tell me your first name because i feeling foolish forget i asked
it was a mistake
lynn watches thoughtfully after bud as he walks away
he opens his car door like hes going to tear ir off
a last glance back at lynn and as he gets in the car
an l shaped walk up
jack coasts the car to the curb
he leaps out with exley
exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan
he leans down to look in the window at the two way on the dash
shit someone beat us here
voices from the carport ahead
we see a chrome bumper the purple fender of a mercury coupe
a door slams
jack starts over with exley
toting shotguns dudleys boys from the victory motel breuning and carlisle stand by the purple mercury
jack and exley come around the corner lower their guns
breuning wheels pumps a round into the chamber
he very nearly fires before he sees who it is
what the fuck are you guys doing here
think of us as back up
what do you got
as jack moves to peer through the mercs window
three ithaca pumps an empty box of double ought buck and cash
jack spots them
three shotguns on the passenger side floor an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills
so long vice
badge of honor here i come
fuck you vincennes
its our collar
breuning actually has to restrain his partner
im ranking officer here
we go as a team
end of story
breuning and carlisle lead the way with jack and exley bringing up the rear
squinting exley reaches to his pocket for something
chuckling just dont shoot me
the door to
two men on either side
breuning rears back
jack rears back
they kick at the same instant
the door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men larry fontaine and ty jones waking from a couple of flop mattresses
fontaine jumps up
entering carlisle aims but exley grabs his arm
the blast rips the ceiling
jones doesnt dare get up
ace him jack
shut up carlisle
jack and exley burst into a
another black ray coates passed out on mattress sur rounded by empty beer cans
jack sticks his
in his back starts to cuff him
as the cuff ratchets down
dudley watches intently as ed exley skims a report memorizing names and dates
jack and other brass are also here along with a stenographer
one of these guys killed stensland
through tinted glass the three suspects in three different rooms
casitas youth camp
coates twenty two a boxer
manager saw them burning clothes
satisfied exley sets the report down
ed i want confessions
ill break them sir
as exley steps into the room jack joins dudley
you think golden boy can handle it cap
i think youll be surprised what edmunds capable of
exley closes the door
ray coates is cuffed to a chair dressed in baggy county denims
one eye swollen shut lip split a smashed nose with one nostril split
exley unlocks his cuffs
drops cigarettes and amtches on the table
as coates rubs his wrists
they call you sugar ray because of ray robinson
no answer they say robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second
do you believe that
coates just stares at him
youre twenty two arent you ray
say what and so what
did one of the officers work you over a little
coates just stares back
you look like robinson after that last lamotta fight
course lamotta looked a lot worse
so youre twenty two right
man why do you keep asking me that
just getting my facts straight
twenty two makes it a gas chamber bounce
you should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago
get life do a little youth authority jolt transfer to folsom a big man
orbit on some of that good prison brew get yourself a sissy i never truck with no sissies
that fucking larry
i almost believed him
laughs that larry hes a pisser
you did the casitas youth camp with him didnt you
man whyre you talkin about larry
his business is his business
unseen by coates exley reaches under the table takes hold of one of three toggle switches
sugar larry told me you went sissy up at casitas
you couldnt do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you
he said they call you sugar because you gave it out so sweet
exley flips the toggle
the speaker over larry fontaines head crackles to life
larry gave it at casitas
man i was the fuckin boss jocker on my dorm
larrys the sissy
larry gave it for candy bars
exley flips up the second toggle
ray you protected ty and larry up in casitas didnt you
you aint woofin i did
stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin dog
exley flips the switches off
i heard you like to shoot dogs
dogs got no reason to live
you feel that way about people too
man whatre you saying
ray we got the shotguns
i dont own no shotguns
why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator
trembling say what
you guys were arrested this morning but none of you have last nights clothes
you were seen burning them

i got nothin more to say till i see a judge
were you on hop
you were passed out when you got arrested
were you hopped up ray
ty and larry fuck with that shit not me
where do they get their stuff

just a little one
exley flips up the toggles as he leans in
lives on bunker hill
he runs a hole up for parole absconders and sells red devils
exley flips down the switches stands
im going to take a break
exley opens the door looks back in afterthought
you know ray im talking about the gas chamber and you havent even asked me what this is all about
you got a big guilty sign around your neck
your father wouldve been proud
pointing this ones on the verge
exley looks through the glass into
larry fontaine is weeping
a piss puddle on the floor by his chair
fontaine next but give jones the newspaper
i want him primed
fontaine tries to control his sniffles as exley enters
larry ray coates ratted you off
he said the nite owl was your idea
you want to tell me about it
i think it was rays idea
talk and i think i can save your life
larry this is a gas chamber job
if you dont talk youll be dead in six months
son six people are dead and somebody has to pay
it can be you or it can be ray
larry he called you queer
he said at casitas you took it up the ass
he said the voice is strong full of conviction
exley glances at the mirror
whyd you burn the clothes
sobbing i just wanted to lose my cherry
i didnt mean to hurt her
exley cant hide his surprise at this
was she a hooker
but fontaine is gone
head lolling eyes squeezing out tears
exley steps out of the interrogation room
dudley braces him
dont get sidetracked
stay with the nite owl
she may still be alive whoever she is
buds all ears
reading jones has his feet on the table
exley bursts in
this newspaper shit aint shit
wheres the girl
did you kill her
no answer but jones looks nervous
you wanted larry to lose his cherry but things got out of hand
is that right
everyones attention is riveted particularly buds
they watch listen over the speaker
over speaker kick loose jones
i know you made her bleed but that doesnt mean you killed her
no answer but jones is squirming
over speaker if that girls alive youve still got a chance on this one
over speaker i think shes alive
over speaker you think jack turns to dudley
ill give him that
they dont notice as the chair back begins to splinter in buds hands
exley sits across from him tries to wrap it up
where is she now
no answer did you leave her someplace
no answer did you sell her out
give her to some of your buddies
tell me where the girl is
the door blasts open
bud slams jones up against the wall
as exley stands he bangs his knee on the table
bud breaks the cylinder drops shells on the floor
one in six
wheres the girl
officer white put down that weapon and bud shoves the barrel into jones mouth pulls the trigger twice
jones starts to slide down the wall
bud jerks him back up roars
two more clicks
s sylvester f fitch one o nine and avalon gray corner house
a four cordon
they coast up to a gray corner house
dudley smith behind the wheel of the lead cruiser
bud white rides shotgun reloading his revolver
give me one minute
youve got it wendell
bud is out the door and scooting down an alley
exley moves to follow but dudley cuts him off
were going through the front
bud vaults a fence pads up the back porch
a screen door
bud slips the catch with a penknife and walks inside
bud heads for a blind covered door
unlocked he enters
light bouncing from side rooms
we hear the opening spiel of badge of honor from the left
bud wheels into a
a nude girl spread eagled on a mattress
bound with neckties
one in her mouth
her eyes grow wide at the sight of bud then flicker to the adjoining room
sylvester fitch sits naked at the table wolfing rice krispies and watching badge of honor on a flickering tv
he looks up sees the
before he sees bud beyond it
fitch drops his spoon raises his hands
bud shoots him in the face
dead fitch just sits there
bud moves behind him
pulling a spare piece from an ankle holster bud fires back at the door from fitchs line of fire then puts the gun in fitchs hand
we hear the front door crash open
as fitch slides off the chair to the floor bud dumps the rice krispies on him
the girl on a stretcher
being carried to an ambulance
bud white walks alongside looking like some ferocious pet pit bull
the attendants get her inside
one joins her
the other closes the door pauses to light a smoke
bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth nearly taking the guys lips with it
get her to the fucking hospital
one look at bud and the attendant is running around to the drivers side
exley arrives steamed
a naked guy with a gun
you expect anyone to believe that
get the fuck away from me
bud starts away but exley gets right in his face
other cops begin to take notice
the ambulance pulls out
hows it going to look on your report
itll look like justice
thats what that fat fuck got
justice you dont know what the word means you dumb bastard
bud goes after exley but ten hands pull them apart
dudley on exley
four cops genuinely having trouble on bud
and as if things couldnt get crazier shouts from the cops on the street
police radios cranked up
repeat three suspects escaped from the hall of justice jail
the nite owl killers raymond coates tyrone jones and larry fontaine
they are considered armed and extremely dangerous
descriptions are as follows
electrified nite owl killers on everyones lips
exley strides through with purpose beelines to a filing cabinet
exley pulls the file hes looking for
he scans an interrogation transcript reads to himself the words hes looking for give me one to feed the d
lives on bunker hill
runs a hole up for parole absconders
police rush back and forth
exley hurries over to the desk but hes not there
anyone seen jack vincennes
a few cops mumble they havent
as exley decides what to do carlisle from the original arrest steps over
is something up lieutenant
exley and carlisle pull up across the street from a four story victorian with paint peeling off the clap boards
they jump out of the car toting shotguns
carlisle waits as exley checks the mail slots r
exley and carlisle take the steps two at a time
exley squints reaches to a pocket
no glasses he passes an elevator rounds a corner
exley pumps the shotgun nods to carlisle who kicks the door in
exley and carlisle burst in on four men eating sandwiches
fontaine and caucasian navarette at a table
coates on the floor
jones by the window
fontaine and navarette raise their hands
a jostled beer bottle crashes to the floor
reacting carlisle jerks the trigger
fontaine goes down
navarette draws a
shoots carlisle twice in the chest
exley blasts navarette
screaming jones pulls a
from his belt
exley fires blowing him right through the window
coates draws and fires makes a run for it
a bad pull takes out half a back wall
coates is out the door
coates makes it inside frantically pushes buttons
here comes exley
stumbling wiping navarettes blood out of his eyes he closes on the
coates watches as the elevator doors begin closing
the shotgun barrel juts through
the doors bang against it
tony bennett belts boulevard of broken dreams
exley returns to grudging respect
his white shirt flecked with blood hes clapped on the back by dudley who dubs him shotgun ed
exley doesnt enjoy it
hes numb stumbling along
as he notices the blood on his hands
nite owl hero
over a photo of exley
a coffin is lowered into the ground
a widow leans on the chiefs arm accepts a tri folded american flag from dudley smith
exley drops a handful of earth on the casket has trouble getting the wet dirt off his hands
we mourn the passing of a good man
the loss of sgt
william carlisle is the loss of his wife his family and the entire los angeles police department
a sea of dress blues
jack looks bored dressed too flashy for a funeral
bud looks grim rain dripping off the brim of his cap
as a twenty one gun salute is larry fontaines mother mourns alone as her son is buried
exley talks with a tough starchy nurse
i need the girl to give me a chronology of events
she barely remembers her own name
but i was told the case was closed
should i call your superior to double check
that wont be necessary
the nurse turns marches away
exley is left with a nagging doubt
people cheer as bulldozers mow down orange trees
a banner heralds the future on this site the worlds biggest amusement park
cartoon characters dance among the fallen trees
sitting behind a desk is the older gentleman last seen doing his best alan ladd impersonation at lynn brackens
he stares emphatically at the smarmy lawyer who stands before him holding a manila folder
you tell mr
patchett i have no intention of changing my vote
the lawyer simply hands him a stack of photographs
from lynn brackens apartment
the first is the older gentleman naked except for his socks and garters
the older gentleman rises for an assembly vote
it may surprise some but a mature man enlightened by the facts can change him mind
a limo disgorges a heavy set man who climbs steps knocks on the door
lynn answers in an evening gown
he gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her
lynns about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan a look down the street
buds packard is parked there and we can see his darkened silhouette behind the wheel
smiling a bit sadly to herself lynn disappears inside
this is no stake out
bud watches after her with yearning
cigarette girls and club photographer make the rounds
johnny stompanato enjoys the frenzien floor show
a horse parade heavy on the law enforcement contingent out of place in his suit and tie district attorney ellis loew awkwardly rides atop a sleek palimono
the crowd in a frenzy as vincennes snitch the welterweight black boxer beats the shit out of a white fighter
a father holds out his hand counts along as jack slaps bills into his palm
maybe four thousand dollars
jack says something about we appreciate your understanding during this difficult time
as badge of honor comes on the tv the father responds with goddamn actors
leading jack looks through an open door where brett chases high school sweater girl is being comforted by her mother
as she locks eyes with him an instant
the monied johns watch horny as hell as ginger rogers twirls around the room with a female fred astaire
clothes fly as they spin
still most eyes turn to lynn bracken as she enters oozing that cat girl grace
reporters scribble as the chief speaks
uniforms everywhere along with exley and loew
bus sits in the back
exley has amassed a brilliant record in his seven years with the l
recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty
it is my honor to present him with our highest honor the medal of valor
exley steps up
the chief hangs a gold medallion around his neck
flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands
exley then accepts a handshake from dudley
the policemen stand on cue applaud without enthusiasm
dudley lifts the medal from his chest
your father wouldve been proud
exley uses the noise to have aprivate chat with dudley
there are loose ends out there dudley
i there always are
but there are also three men and three guns
a few loose ends dont matter
i feel it inside
doesnt that sound crazy
dudley puts an arm around exleys shoulder smiles out as more bulbs flash
breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind
a little self doubt
just keep it inside
between you and you
exley considers his medal
it is an appealing thing
in the back bud stays sprawled in his seat
no ones watching as he takes out his gun kisses it and blows pretend smoke off the barrel
as the song ends
a badge of honor fund raiser for d
loews re election cmpaign
hot dogs and sauerkraut
fishbowls stuffed with cash
jack is here returns a smile half heartedly
loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as brett joe reno chase speaks
this election is about the future of law enforcement in los angeles
ellis loew represents that future
so dig deep and lets get a moral man re elected
leaving the podium chase smiles at ellis loews daughter who absolutely gushes
chase then winks knowingly to jack who returns a tired humorless smile
jack scans the room
an odd moment as jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way
he puts a hand to his face
is that him
big v jack vincennes
jack turns to see sid hudgeons approaching
youre back boychick
sid how are they hanging
down around my ankles
hudgeons scans the crowd points someone out
you remember matt reynolds
jack spots matt reynolds one of the young actors jack arrested on christmas eve
the graumans chinese pot bust
he just got off the honor farm
whats he doing here sid

hes queer too
metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues
on screen and off
im getting him to fuck the d
for a hundred bucks
winks thats twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career
even jacks not immune to a comment like that
as hudgeons heads over hudgeons points out
loew right there
reynolds gets a nervous bead on loew
hudgeons realizes you need a drink kid
jack look after him a minute
kid this is jack
no secrets between me and him
hudgeons heads off
reynolds plae nods at jack
have we met before
jack doesnt really feel like talking to him
reynolds nerves wont let him stay quiet
was it a party
something like that
misreading oh i know
a fleur de lis party right
jack remembers the name plays along for what its worth
fleaur de lis
whatever you desire
dope liquor hookers that look like movie stars
pierce patchett has it all
jack recognizes the name bluffs for more information
me and patchett go way back
pierce isnt like regular people
i dig him but he scares me too
shakes his head you know when i came out to l
this isnt exactly where i saw myself ending up
reynolds looks like hes going to cry
hudgeons returns with a double scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut
he hands the drink to matt
dutch courage kid
reynolds downs a few gulps looks across the room at loew
i dont know if i should do this
hey its not like you dont know how
and jack here has connections on badge of honor
pull this off and therell be a part for you
i smell a comeback

reynolds looks to jack who gives a noncommittal shrug
reynolds nods drains his glass and heads off
hudgeons hands jack a folded slip of paper
if reynolds works his charms which he will this is the address where theyll be
meet me at midnight
i guarantee all sorts of illegal activity
hudgeons takes out a president grant bill
jack doesnt take it
sid why would a guy like pierce patchett get involved with running dope and hookers
whered you hear that
jackie all i know is what you know
the man is very rich
and hes invested in freeway construction so hes gonna get a lot richer
but thats it
patchetts what i like to call twilight
he aint queer he aint red he cant help me in my quest for prime sinuendo
jack takes the as reynolds returns shaking his head
what i cant do it
talk to him jack
tell him about the opening on the show
im pretty sure i can get you a part on the show
pretend its an acting job kid
and no onell know about this
itll be our secret
emboldened by jacks promise reynolds heads off
jack and hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with loew whos captivated
hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog gives jack the high sign but jack just feels like a pimp
a cauliflower eared cleveland mob enforcer on the hotseat
breuning works him with a rubber hose as dudley asks unanswered questions
bud watches revulsion growing
where did you intend to start
no answer go back to cleveland lad
this is the city of angels and you havent got any wings
more screams as the hose thwops down
bud looks away then shuffles blindly out of the room
bud runs water in the sink to drown out the screams
it doesnt work
finally he leans down and sticks his head under the stream of water
that doesnt work either
hair dripping wet bud makes it to his car
the tires spit gravel as he tears away
dudley appears in the doorway watching curiously
as cauliflower continues to bud watches lynn brackens apartment colored lights play on the windows
finally the front door opens
theres veronica lake all sparkles and spangles kissing another distinguished gentleman goodnight
bud watches the man into a waiting limo
as it pulls away
now lynn just looks tired
as she puts away scotch bottles and picks up empty glasses theres a knock on the door
lynn sighs become sultry veronica lake before our eyes
opening door did you forget some bud stands there filling up the door frame
i wondered when you might ring the bell again officer white
bud looks at lynn a moment then down at his own feet
you should see yourself
you look like youre ten years old
bud looks back up
lynns smile fades as she studies his face
shes not going to ask questions
lynn looks at him a moment more then runs a hand through the blonde hair covering one eye
if youd called first i wouldnt look this ridiculous
lynn comes to bud naked her hair brushed back
bud goes slow gently takes time with his kisses like she was a lonely woman he wanted to love to death
lynn plays off his timing her kisses back her touches
finally bud forces himself to stop
he pulls back so he can see her
youre wondering if patchett told me to be receptive
bud doesnt answer but yes
it doesnt matter
i like you bud
i really do
she kisses him
softly drawing it out
not a job
she wants to make love to him
and as bud stops thinking
jack sits in his car waiting
he checks his watch
well past midnight
come on sid
where are you
move with him as he gets out and crosses the street
the apartment is dark the front door a few inches ajar
suspicious jack listens
no one here it seems
till jack nearly trips over a body
soaked in blood
jack looks down in horror as reynolds seems to stare back up at him
jack stumbles out the door
we hear his car door slam shut the screech of rubber down the street
jack pounds on sids door till lights switch on
hudgeons opens the door
hes in his pajamas
you got some good scoop for the sidster
sid cut the crap
i give me some narco skinny
i want to put out an all hop head issue
shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars
maybe tie it into the rosenbergs
jack grabs him jerks him into the door frame
confused whats wrong trash
what happened with the kid and loew
you didnt get my message
it got called off
the kid chickened out at the last minute
i was just there
somebody slit his throat
jack thats a story
swish actor gets the gay blade
let me get my camera
hudgeons starts away but jack grabs him
loew didnt go with him
i put reynolds in the cab myself
the night cost me a hundred scoots and i got bupkis
jack lets go of him starts to ramble off into the night
let me get my camera
where are you going
the bartender walks down the bar to where jack arrives
whatll it be jack
pulls out wallet a bottle of scotch
as the bartender turns for one the only bill jack finds is the president grant fifty
the things hes done for fifty bucks
as he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror the bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass
he plucks the fifty from jacks hand
jack grabs the bottle and starts out
spent bud and lynn lie in bed
she traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling
who was that guy who was here earlier
lynns tracing finger stops on buds shoulder a small white scar
it doesnt matter
all they get is veronica lake
you got the real lynn margaret bracken
re scar whered this come from
when i was ten my old man threw a bottle at my mother
i guess i got in the way
so you saved her
but not for long
bud looks away
lynn sees he doesnt want to talk about it
do you like being a cop bud
i used to
what i do now is strong arm
sitting duck stuff
no i dont like it
if i could work homicide like a real detective
lynn listens sympathetically
buds opening up
theres something wrong with the nite owl
that prick exley shot the wrong guys
but they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there
frustrated bud pokes at his own chest
in here i know it
but i cant prove it
im not a detective
im not smart enough
im just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless
bud looks away embarrassed to have shown so much of himself
lynn reaches over turns his face back to her
you found patchett
you found me
youre smart enough
be a detective if thats what you want
that simple huh
exley looks up as a clerk enters holding two files
i got the rap sheets on the black guys sir
coates and jones got charges a mile long
but except for some kid stuff fontaines clean
more or less
until he gunned down six people
exley stands in the trees as a park ranger approaches
i asked my men lieutenant
no one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns
then who phoned in the report
ray pinker looks up from his microscope as bud enters
bud white what brings you down to the basement
i got a few nite owl questions
i dont know if you read the papers but that case is closed
im tying up loose ends
padding my report
you know how it goes
what do you want to know
anything that didnt make sense
you mean beside the fact that thirty five out of forty five rounds were gratuitous
i cant think of anything
pinker is ticked as bud steps over to where a group of nite owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall
bud pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table
we see a high heel shoe blood smears across the floor
pointing if she was sitting here then its facing the wrong way
what are these smears in the blood
it looks like she was flailing trying to get away
but shes moving away from the door
thinks points who was sitting at this table
a beat had to be dumb panic
if she knew him she wouldve been sitting with him
bud wonders maybe a puzzle piece just fell into place
pinker remembers something
you know there is one thing
pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands bud
inside are two wax saturated cotton balls
i found them just inside the meat locker door
ear plugs exactly
at least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears
it doesnt exactly play like dumb panic
what do you mean
its like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in
bud just stares at the picture of susan lefferts
a shingle shack dump
bud walks the front steps rings the bell
hilda lefferts answers
she doesnt look so good
lefferts im officer white with the l
id like to ask a couple of questions
let my daughter rest in peace
pictures of susan smile down from four walls
vamp poses on a nightclub floor
lefferts is all twitchy and nervous her eyes darting to a closed door
tell me about the boyfriend she had
the one you mentioned at the morgue
first i want to go on record as saying that my susie was a virgin when she died
maam im sure she was
lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter
susie i told you i didnt approve of that boyfriend
he was too old for you
you let him come into this house and be fresh to me
i went out one day and old mrs
jensen next door saw susans boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus
what was that boyfriends name
we were never properly introduced
susan and i were fighting that day
she called him by a nickname
muns or lunts or something
was it stens
i dont know
look at a picture for me
bud hands her a snapshot of stensland taken in tijuana
out of uniform
she recognizes him
you said a neighbor heard a ruckus
was it outside inside
lefferts eyes go crazy darting to a closed door
rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it
i dont know
youll have to leave now officer
bud starts for the closed door
whats through here
bud kicks away the towels opens the door steps into
innocuous except for the smell
it hits bud right off
dont mind the smell
i think a rat died behind the wall
my susie was a good girl
tell me about the ruckus
i came home that night and there was blood on the floor
susan said stams stens had cut himself
they were acting nervous
and that stens kept going under the house
lefferts goes shrill bud beelines out the door
holding a flashlight bud crawls under the house into
bud elbow crawls over the dirt between wooden pilings
theres a long burlap sack ahead
it smells bad
bud rips burlap
a rats nest explodes
bud sweeps a forearm at them
as they clear he sees a gristle caked human skull staring back a
hole in the forehead
undaunted bud tears the burlap back further
he pats the corpses pockets comes up with a wallet
bud checks the id
bus knows him by that name and another
bud crawls out blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air
lefferts is there
a great big one
bud opens meeks wallet pulls out a couple hundred bucks and gives them to mrs
compliments of the los angeles police department
ray pinker looks up from an autopsy as exley enters
hey just in time for our stomach of the week
frankfurters with sauerkraut french fries coca cola alcohol and sperm
jesus what a last supper
the stiff is matt reynolds
pinker continues working away
the nite owl
anything bothering you about the case
the fact that you guys wont let it get filed away
what are you talking about
bud white grilled me on it this morning
you know hes not as dumb as i thought
as exleys head swims
lefferts waters the grass watches as a car pulls up
exley gets up starts toward her
she drops the hose and runs for the front door exley cuts her off
let my susie rest in peace
lefferts i just want to ask a few questions
that other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss
a sweet man
thinking out loud under the house
all he found were rodents
no signs of foul play
exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace
he hurries over enters nearly flat on his belly
lefferts calls in after him
my daughter was a virgin
i dont doubt it oh god
jack sits unshaven and hung over the dregs of the scotch bottle on the desk
he considers a framed badge of honor photo jack and brett chase before a banner to protect and serve
jack punches a fist through it
exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the lab atop a gurney
pinker steps over
i need an i
you talk only to me on this one
sitting in disgust jack spots something amidst all the clutter the great jerk off books of
he flips one over looks at the fleur de lis stamp
jack remembers something matt reynolds told him
he dials the phone
sergeant jack vincennes requesting
i need the home address on a pierce patchett
please hold sergeant
as jack waits exley appears in front of him
i need to speak to you
give me a minute will ya
exley clicks off the phone
what i want you to follow bud white
even im not that crazy
its not a request
i need to know what white knows
follow him or ill have you pulled off badge of honor
yesterday that mightve meant something
pull me off
youd be doing me a big favor
yesterday yes today no
what happened last night
transfer me suspend me
just leave me alone
you make a mistake
my whole life
jack stands heads out
exley follows he needs help
listen i think i made a mistake too
i aint a priest lieutenant
i cant hear your confession
do you make the three negroes for the nite owl killings
its a simple question
you should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the nite owl lieutenant exley watches as jack continues down a hall
then rollo tomasi
jack stops looks back at him
is there more to that or do i have to guess
rollo was a purse snatcher
my father ran into him off duty
he shot my father six times and got away clean
no one even knew who he was
i made the name up to give him some personality
so whats the point
rollos the reason i became a cop
i wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it
it was supposed to be about truth and justice and rollo
but somewhere along the way i forgot all that
how about you jack
whyd you become a cop
jack looks like he might cry but smiles instead
i dont remember
both men are quiet a moment
im trying to figure what angle youre playing this time but i sure as hell cant see one
ive given up angles for awhile
i just want to solve this thing
the nite owl was solved lieutenant
i want to do it right
so does jack
okay college boy ill help you
but i want half the collar
i dont think we can make a case without bud white
a packard pulls up out front
bud gets out heads inside
another car pulls up across the street
jack gets out starts across the street
at the bar johnny stompanato looks over as bud joins him
stompanato isnt happy about it but he smiles anyway
wendell white hows tricks paesano i aint your paesano you wop cocksucker
nervous johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer
what do you want officer you remember an ex cop named buzz meeks
he works for a guy named patchett
johnny taps his ring harder
the bottle almost tips
his file listed you as a known associate
that was a long time ago
before your day
the last few years hes been muscle for hire
but i heard hes disappeared
mores gonna cost you
buds hand flashes out grabs stompanato by the crotch
how bout i give you your balls back
in considerable pain before meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin
where would a two bit ex cop get pounds of heroin
mickey cs narcotics lieutenant
the night he got clipped eighteen pounds of mickeys heroin went missing
bud loosens his grip
stompanato gasps for air
jack peels in catches a glimpse of bud and stompanato
too far away too hear anything jack quickly ducks out
meeks is probably in rio or someplace like that by now
hes under a tract house in san berdoo
and he dont smell too good
what happened to the heroin johnny
i dont know
i swear it
bud starts to raise a hand
stompanato cringes but bud just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes
jacks on the phone to exley
hes in the brown derby with johnny stompanato
sees bud exit check that
i gotta go
jack pulls up sees bud knock on the front door
it opens and bud steps in
jack doesnt see who opens it
theres movement in the underbrush
jack appears followed by exley
jack pulls a gun as they near a window
whats that for
he sees us and were dead
they press up to the glass for a partial view
bud white sits on a footstool massaging a pair of womens feet
jack and exley exchange a long curious look
this isnt the bud white theyre used to
a pair of womans hands take bud the arms covered in glitter and satin
the woman lynn bracken leans forward to kiss her policeman
it may have been a long day but shes every inch veronica lake
only the hairs not over her eye
they stand kiss again
lynns gown spills down around her ankles
bud scoops lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom
a long beat before
maybe whites not so dumb after all
rita hayworth at the morgue and now veronica lake with white
what the hells going on
movie star hookers
whatever you desire
its fleur fr lis again
whats fleur de lis
high line whores
with plastic surgery to look like movie stars
and who knows what else
its run by this guy pierce patchett
you want to talk to him
but first i want to brace stompanato
exley and jack enter
check the bar
i got the restaurant
theres stompanato with a girl who looks amazingly like lana turner
engrossed stomapanato doesnt look up till exleys nearly on top of him
hey you want an autograph write to m g m
since when do two bit hoods and hookers give out autographs
what as stompanato stands exley flashes his badge
who in the hell do you think you are
take a walk honey before i haul your ass downtown
who in the hell do you think are you are making a large mistake
as jack arrives lana tosses a drink in exleys face
get away from our table
grabs her wrist shut up
being cut to look like lana turner doesnt mean you are lana turner
jack pulls him aside
she is lana turner
she is lana turner
the sky glows ahead
how was i supposed to know
a moment before jack begins to laugh
exley joins him
exleys plymouth is parked on the street
in a silk robe the unflappable pierce patchett smiles at exley
jack stands alongside
i believe the nite owls your area of expertise mr
i saw you on television getting your medal
turns to jack and youre that other celebrity hollywood policeman arent you
exley and jack dont look like they appreciate being joked with
patchett finally sighs
ill tell you what i told officer white when he asked me about susans death
a look to jack bud whites been here
for the last time
i may suborn women into illicit activities but theyre handsomely compensated i treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect
is the veronica lake look alike one of your whores
a vulgar term but yes
whats her name
whys she seeing bud white
why do men and women usually see each other
anything else you want to add before i talk to her
not good enough
unfazed then try talking to my lawyer
good evening gentlemen
exley and jack head for the car
guys as cool as they come
a call crackles in over exleys radio
exley picks up
this is exley
ray pinker wants to talk to you lieutenant
says he has your i
tell him sergeant vincennes is coming in to talk to him
what are you going to do
im going to lynn brackens
ill meet you at the dining car
you get the girl i get the coroner
watching exley and vincennes from the window patchett picks up the phone dials
over phone hush hush off the record and on the q
knocking on the door
lynn answers to reveal exley
miss bracken im lieutenant exley
i know who you are
youre the policeman bud told me about
what did white say
he said you were smart
he also said you were competing with your dead father
how did he put it
trying to measure up to a ghost
exley lets it pass
as he enters
lets concentrate on my smarts
pierce patchett made you didnt he
he taught you how to dress and talk and think and i am very impressed with the results
but i need some answers and if i dont get them im going to take you and patchett down
he can take care of himself and im not afraid of you
and you forgot one thing lieutenant
pierce also taught me how to fuck
can i get you a drink
exley cant help but smile
lynn smiles back
exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks
im curious about you
she hands him his drink
because bud hates you more than he loves me
lynn watches him over the rim of her glass
it galls you that i know so much about you
you dont have information to compete
dont underestimate me miss bracken
the way youve underestimated bud white
exleys had it
a menacing step forward
lynns smile becomes a laugh
lost to himself exley leans in and kisses her
lynn pulls back then kisses back
in a beat theyre rolling to the floor shedding clothes
as they trash the furniture lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror
two way glass
sid hudgeons is in here snapping pictures
as lynn and exley continue with their frantic lovemaking
ray pinker rubs his tired eyes
god bless dental records
stiff used to be a cop
you knew him
he was around when i first joined the force
a bad egg
pinker could care less
as jacks wheels turn
jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like and
reading one headed meeks jack lets out a low whistle
hes found something
jack waits at the bar watches the door anxiously
come on exley
where are you
spent exley and lynn sit half dressed on the floor
then through a smile how was i
oh the best i ever had
absolutely the best
laughs you sound like you mean it
the silver screens loss is your gain
how about white
you want to know what buds like in bed
she actually embarrasses him with that one
i want to know why you see him
is it a patchett payoff
i see bud because i want to
i see bud because he cant hide the warmth he has inside him
ill take your word for it
i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken and not some veronica lake look alike who fucks for money
i see him because he doesnt know how to disguise who he is
theres more if you want to hear it
exley shakes his head
hes heard enough
does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier
i dont hate white
i really dont
its just in my business its the wild cars you have to watch out for
you dont like that you dont know how to play him
he doesnt follow the same rules of politics you do
that makes him dangerous
you cut to the heart of things dont you
what about lynn bracken
she going to be a hooker all her life
i came out here with a dream
thats gone but i settled for reality
this is the means to the reality
but im not going to tell you what it is
because youll use it against me
exley doesnt answer but the answer is yes
youre tougher than bud thinks you are
smiles youre the first person to ever call me tough
like recognizes like
im pretty tough myself
you me and white huh
actually buds only tough on the outside
as exley kisses her
exasperated that hes still stuck in here sid hudgeons checks his watch shakes his head in disgust
jack knocks at a darkened house
the porch lights come on
the door opens to reveal dudley smith in his bathrobe
its three a
two minutes dudley
lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in santa barbara
jack sits at the table while dudley makes coffee
you remember buzz meeks dudley
a disgrace as a policeman
straight d fitness reports from every c
he ever served under
what about him
twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with dick stensland
they arrested a pierce patchett on an extortion scam
guy ran hookers
hed have them photographed with their johns then double dip for some blackmail
charges got dropped
you were supervising officer on the case and i was wondering if you remember anything about it
whats this all about lad
part of it has to do with a murder
ive been working with ed exley on it
youre narco lad not homicide
and since when do you work with edmund
its a private investigation
i fucked something up and i want to make amends
dont start trying to do the right thing john
you havent had enough practice
dudley walks over hands jack his coffee
have you discussed this with anyone else john
not even with exley
jack shakes his head
dudley raises a revolver
he fires it at point blank range right into jacks heart
jack hits the floor his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum
jack opens his mouth to speak
his lips form the words but no sound comes out
dudley crouches down beside him
have you a valediction lad
dudley leans low gives jack an ear
as he dies
dudley frowns in ignorance at the name
nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their own
dudley is at the podium along with exley
dozens of detectives take notes including bud white
sergeant vincennes body was found in echo park at ten oclock this morning
killed by a single
round to the heart
one of our own gentlemen
we cannot tolerate it
justice must be swift and merciless
as the men move odd dudley approaches exley
edmund a word with you
we received a tip this morning
did vincennes ever mention the name rollo tomasi
exley tries to look like hes thinking as jack calls from the grave
screaming the name dudley
whered the tip come from
as dudley moves off exley watches him go
bud looks over as dudley sits down across from him
youre perplexing to me these days wendell
youre not your old cruel self anymore
i need proof that the extracurricular work i had planned for you remains within your grasp
ive long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation
that day will soon be here and youll share handsomely
grand means will be in our hands wendell
imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it
imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated
but dont stop there
imagine the police in control
its big lad
you lost me dudley
i dont know what youre talking about
you have your extracurricular secrets i have mine
well hold a clarification session soon
for now i need your fearsome old habits at the victory motel
were going to brace a man who may know who killed jack vincennes
can i count on you
sure you can
pinker looks up as exley enters
i want to know what you and jack vincennes talked about last night
anything and everything
start with the i
on the corpse
a put upon pinker sighs
an ex cop
i pulled his police academy photo
pinker goes to his desk for a twenty year old photo of meeks
he hands it to exley whose wheels are turning
we got a dead ex cop and a girl who looks like rita hayworth at the nite owl
another dead ex cop under the house of ritas mother
its not a good week for ex cops
i got vincennes in the next room
its not a good week for cops in general
a rain storm has turned the courtyard into a mud bath
as usual a light burns in room six
bud white parks alongside the other cars already here
he makes a dash for the door
sid hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat
dudley sits across from him
dudleys henchman breuning looms
this is mr
im happy to cooperate
you dont need to tie me down
its for your own safety
now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes
the big v
i can tell you hes on the night train to the big adios
breuning cuffs hudgeons in the side of the head
take it easy
i didnt have anything to do with him getting killed if thats what you mean
but you were business associates
what does that have to do breuning cuffs him again
okay so we worked together
it was an information exchange
i got him first class collars and he got me good stories
we were friends for chrissakes
well drop that line for now
please comment on pierce patchett
bud looks over at mention of the name
you think he had something to do with vincennes getting iced
dudley sighs looks to bud
i want full and docile cooperation on all topics
hudgeons flinches as bud steps up twice breunings size
everyone knows patchetts worth a boat load of greenbacks
from aviation freeway construction
but the man has hobbies too
he bankrolls b movies under the table and runs movie star look alike hookers
and try this on hes rumored to be a periodic heroin sniffer
all in all a powerful behind the scenes strange o
bud digs a fist into hudgeons gut
as hudgeons gasps to get his breath back
hudgeons is the key to all relationships
he runs call girls
fixed up like movie stars
bud looms rests his hands on the back of hudgeons chair
he doesnt like where this is going
in my car
the trunk under the carpet
patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt lynn looks just like veronicaaa wooden slats pop as bud tears the bolted chair right out of the floor
hudgeons and the chair land sideways
bud cant hear him
he uprights the chair one handed
as his fist cocks back hes restrained by breuning and dudley
this is no act
they can barely hold bud back
get him away from me
bud breaks free heads outside
bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with a ferocious yank
he tears at the carpeting
a manila envelope
bud rips it open and x glossies of exley and lynn spill out
raindrops dot them as buds in his packard and tearing out of there
dudley and breuning watch from the door
i wouldnt trade places with edmund exley right now for all the tea in china
so does hudgeons
dudley i thought you were gonna let the dumb bastard kill me
to breuning and you
learn to pull those punches a little better
dudley and breuning stare at him
a bit grimly
you can uncuff me now fellas
but no one moves to do so
nervous we had a deal
you me and patchett were a team
scared come on were friends
were as hudgeons protests dudley slaps a hand over his mouth
as breuning and carlisle move in
a wormish clerk searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like and
the same ones jack looked through
exley steps over from another row
so on active duty meeks didnt make an arrest from to
someone mustve pulled the records
exley ponders the implications
taking out the photo of meeks he gets an idea
where are the police academy files
i dont have time
i have just show me where they are
blue lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down
a screeching on the wet street as buds packard pulls up
she watches as he gets out and starts for the house
lynn stands holds her arms out
bud stops short on the steps out of reach the rain soaking him
did you talk to exley
come in out of the rain
in the morning well have both our stories for breakfast
bud shakes hs head
i want to know about exley
hes the opposite of you
hes more like me
howd you get to know so much about him
lynn looks god awful sad
come in out of the rain bud
you gonna tell me what happened with you and exley
so tell me about it
looking away in the morning
a beat you fucked him
too tired to lie anymore lynn finally just nods
i thought i was helping you
i thought bud backhands her hard
lynn faces straight into the next one as bud hits her again
a third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son
bud stops short as the self realization slams home
lynn waits stoically
she doesnt start crying till bud turns and runs back into the rain
drawers are open
files are everywhere
exleys reached the end of the line
as he looks through one last file he finds a stack of official photos
then he stops short
theres a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor
two of the cadets are ided as turner meeks and dick stensland
the instructor is dudley smith
exley looks up at the sound of footsteps and bud is there
he slams exley knocks him flat
buds here to kill him
he hauls exley up pummels him then throws him over the table
then up into a wall
buds on some gonzo animal plane
bud strangles him
itll be over in moments
until exleys flailing hands finds buds
yanking it from his waistband exley smashes bud in the forehead
but blind with rage he moves back in only to have the barrel of the
placed right between his eyes
she told you
bud shakes his head
hes coiled ready to make a move
who told you
did dudley have anything to do with you finding out
bud hesitates the answer obvious
listen to me
dudley killed jack
it has something to do with buzz meeks
exley points out the academy photo on the floor
dudley and meeks go way back
bud sees but does he really
as bud reaches for the photo exley relaxes slightly
bud slaps the gun away drops exley to the ground
he grabs begins slamming his head into the floor
think goddamn you
exleys almost out
but maybe bud heard him
the attack slows stops as bud does think
exley stays conscious
i knew stensland and meeks knew each other
meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve
the night i met lynn
lefferts mother i
ed stensland as lefferts boyfriend but stens pretended he didnt know either one of them
stensland and meeks
what were they up to
johnny stompanato told me when meeks disappeared he was trying to move the pounds of heroin that went missing when deuce perkins was shot
stensland and buzz meeks two man triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants
when they killed deuce perkins they got heroin as a bonus
then something goes wrong
meeks gets killed
maybe stens got greedy killed meeks and left him under his girlfriends house
a beat the night he died stens was all mysterious
said he had something big going down
the nite owl
stensland was going there to sell the heroin
somebody got wind of it killed them all
it wasnt the negroes
the griffith park report was a phony
and who says the purple merc was spotted outside the nite owl
the first guys to the car when jack and i got there were bruening and carlisle
they didnt find the shotguns
they planted them
it all keeps coming back to dudley
its dudley for the nite owl
they just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in
pierce patchett figures in too
thats the angle jack was working
dudley must work for patchett
lets just kill them
for jack for stensland for anybody else who got in the way
ive been trying to be smart
but killing those two fuckers that would be justice
stay smart bud
we build a case
we play by the rules
there are no rules
why the fuck are you doing this
the nite owl made you
you want to tear all that down
with a wrecking ball
you want to help me swing it
for a second he likes exley
lets go see pierce patchett
run a good cop bad cop
which one are you and which one am exley and bud make their way up the walk
bud pulls his from its shoulder holster shoves it in his waistband
you expecting problems
patchett uses a lot of ex cop muscle
exley rings the buzzer
looking back bud sees a pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the grass
a single ball floats in the koi pond
buds eyes narrow at the sight
not like patchett at all
and bud shoulders the heavy door right off its hinges
bud draws his
as he strides in
exley tries to keep up
a screaming whisper what
double doors on the left open into a library
bud stops short slowly lowers his gun
exley steps up beside him
hanging from a ceiling light patchetts body slowly twists around a toppled chair beneath him
i dont think his ex cop did him much good
bud goes to the body while exley heads for a side table on which rests a typed sheet of paper
bud checks patchetts right hand the knuckles are split two of the fingers badly distended
its a suicide note
says he killed jack because jack had figured out a pornography scam patchett was running
he had help getting up there
two of his fingers are broken
we had one thing figured wrong
i dont think dudley workd for patchett
at least not anymore
he sent you after me
id say dudleys tying up his loose ends
it hits him lynn bud dashes to the phone dials
no one answers
i got a guy who owes me in the sheriffs department
west hollywood station
he can be at her house in two minutes
bud shoves the phone into his hand
a county sheriffs unmarked parked out front
a deputy behind the wheel
exleys plymouth pulls up behind
the deputy gets out
move with him as he steps back to exley whos rolling down his window
is she inside
we took her to hollywood station for safekeeping
someone worked her over pretty good
she wouldnt say who
exley looks at bud
bud looks down in shame
hold her as joan smith
no one sees her unless i okay it
you got it exley
and now were even
as the deputy moves off
what about him
jack thought he was up to his neck in all this
a secretary looks up as bud and exley beeline loews door
you cant go in there
loew looks up as they burst in
do you want me to call the police mr
ask for captain dudley smith
well have a party
hot dogs and sauerkraut
a beat as loew considers his options
these are police
as she leaves what do you want
i want d
bureau men to tail dudley smith twenty four hours a day i want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone i want authorization
to check his bank records and i want it all in an hour
on what evidence

incredulous absolutely not
dudley smith is a highly decorated member of this citys police department and i wont smear his name without without what his smearing yours first
whats he got on you loew
pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down
do you have any proof
the proof had his throat slit
a beat so far youre not denying it
im not going to dignify youwith answers
if youll excuse me ive got a jack vincennes press conference to prepare for
loew enters his bathroom
bud looks to exley who nods go
loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs
bud enters full of menace followed by exley
unless youre here to wipe my ass i think were through
bud just glares at him
loew shakes his head
dont try this good cop bad cop with me
i practically invented it
and so what if some homo actor is dead
boys girls ten of them step off the bus to l
the mirror spiderwebs as bud slams loews face into it
bud swings him around forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet
he holds it there finally lets loew up for breath
then backhands one two three
call him off exley
i dont know how
holding loew by the scruff of the neck bud marches him past exley and back into the
bud heaves up the window practically throws loew through it
loew catches hold of the window framing
bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through
bud holds his leg
loew screams as coins comb and wallet spill from his pockets plummet toward the street below
bud shakes loew could drop him at any time
if i let you go therell be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow
they just wont come on the bus thats all
we hear loews pant leg tearing loose
dudleys got photos of me and reynolds
whats dudleys scheme
loews life may depend on the answer
dudleys rotten to the core
hes taking over mickey cohens rackets his own hand picked copsll be the new franchise holders
because of those pictures i wont be able to prosecute
oh jesus pull me up
exley helps pull loew back inside
bud dumps him on the floor
bruised and bloodied loew looks up at exley
dudleys got everyone under his thumb
not just me but the chief of police the lieutenant governor everybody
exley pulls his
shoves it into the side of loews neck
not everybody you tip off dudley and officer white visits you alone next time
loew looks at bud nods his face a bloody mess
exley and bud exit
buds wheels are turning
they never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers
what if breuning and carlisle took them from the evidence room
couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two
we should check the records and we should talk to lynn
bud just stares at him a beat
you want to talk to her
bud looks away shakes his head no
you do it
ill check the files
lynn looks up as exley enters
her face is puffy swollen
dry if i knew you were coming id have baked a cake
forget everything else for a second lynn
is there anything you can give me on dudley smith
a blank look from her
a police captain
i think hes behind all of this
shakes her head i work for patchett
i had a feeling that there was someone else but i never knew who
look if it helps bud hates himself for what he did
a beat i know how he feels
a beat as exley wonders how he should interpret this
i dont know if its pathetic or romantic but when this is all over id like to see you again
lynn looks away cant help an ironic smile even as she starts to cry
as exley gives her his handkerchief
bud waits at the cage window as a recorder returns with some information
i got your guns bud
signed in april rd
remember the first western bank robbery
they were used in that
i want to see them
no can do
i cant find them
as bud thinks a rookie type approaches
uh sergeant white
what dispatch just got a call for you
lieutenant exley wants you to meet him at the victory motel
buds packard crests the rise looking down on the victory
exleys plymouth is in the courtyard
exley in the hotseat
sitting there thinking
at a car door closing he goes to the door
exley opens the door as bud approaches toting a shotgun
the sun is down
the sky is just a dull glow
you wanted to meet here
you called it
i got a message that
as the reality sinks in bud and exley hear tires on the gravel cars are coming
being in a concavity they dont see them yet
then the cars stop
but still bud and exley cant see anything
they hear the clicks of car doors opening but they dont hear them shut
there are footsteps murmured whispers
more cars pull up
exley starts for his car but bud holds him back
resigned exley nods
they retreat back to room disappear inside
theres movement in the shadows to the left
to the right
theres a big back window
bud covers most of it with a ratty old mattress
he pumps the shotgun
he pulls a
automatic from his waistband
he throws the auto to exley pulls out a
buds armed for bear
you figured this was a set up
and you showed up anyway
a lot of bad stuff happened here
its as good a place as any for it to end
bud switches off the light
they wait in silence
then you know all i ever wanted was to measure up to my father
softly i spent years trying not to live down to mine
thinking we should block off the bathroom
they could come through a creak outside the front door
bud levels the shotgun
the door is blown off its hinges
we see the figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt
in the darkness beyond muzzle flashes from all around
exley and bud we hear the back window break under a muffled blow
bud charges back yanks down the mattress revealing two men climbing through
sitting ducks torn apart by three triple aught rounds close in
a beat then
we got him
bud smiles in on the plan as theres an answering whoop
a third man looks through the window
bud nails him
bud motions exley to stay put then slips out the window
bud crouches looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room
two sets of feet shuffling along
bud fires the shotgun
shrieks as the men go down
bud extends the
to fire point blank headshots
bud flattens himself as a wicked crossfire tears up room
exley is forced down as well lying flat as plaster rains down
the door frame splinters as more dudley men charge in
four men with rifles
one is patchetts burly bodyguard
they spot exley lying there
hushed whispers as they approach dead meat
kicks in the side
the men look at each other sneer
exley jerks a foot
the foot man stumbles as exley spins around shooting
and his own
all four men go down
exley stands digs into his pocket to reload
bud scrambles back through the window
exley looks over and smiles as bud reloads the shotgun
its dead quiet
im thinking we might walk away from this
at that instant dudley steps through the bathroom door
hes got exley dead to rights
as he squeezes the trigger bud leaps forward pushes exley hard to the ground
the shot passes through buds back by his left shoulder blade
it spins him around
a second shot to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges dudley
a third round shatters buds jaw but still he comes
driven by rage his hands reaching for dudleys throat
he even gets hold before a fourth slug tears his chest
bud falls hard
dudley swings his aim to exley whos just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by bud
a frozen moment
im loathe to kill my brother officers edmund
tell that to jack vincennes
jack was a shame but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin
through his whore girl friend
i sent him to make the buy
the rest is history
a vacuum edmund
thats what we have in los angeles
sending mickey cohen up created it
my containment work maintained it
certain photographs guarantee it
organized crime has been held back but theres still a demand for the services it provides
and now youll provide them
prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes
the heroin well run down to the coloreds
as long as its not a middle class problem no one will care
its still a crime free city
for respectable people
dudley aims the
cocks back the hammer
we hear this isnt politics edmund
there wont be winners and losers when its over
dudley doesnt see bud stir reach into a pocket
just the living and the dead
its always been that way in the bureau
you shouldve realized that before you became a detective
dudleys finger tightens on the trigger
but dudley screams as bud buries a switchblade into his left calf
it took all bud had left
as he collapses
dudley wails exley dives for buds shotgun
dudley fires misses
a wild shotgun blast takes out half the wall
dudley stumbles out the door
dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down
exley steps out behind him but doesnt drop the shotgun
the two of them are bleached white by headlights
dudley raises his badge over his head
winks let me do the talking
theyll make you chief of detectives
exley steps ahead to block his way
no why not lad
something like that
really would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorneys working hypothesis
exley doesnt answer
would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty
laughing dudley brushes by limps toward the gathering policemen
are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance theyll the shotgun belches flame
dudley goes down shot in the back
exley drops the gun raises his hands over his head
riding in a convertible waving to the crowds is the grand marshal the new vice president a young richard nixon
a midnight assembly
the chief d
loew and several high ranking brass
their attention riveted through the one way glass into
bloody exhausted exley sits across from two internal you have a lot of explaining to do lieutenant
as exley begins
where were informed that tonights episode of badge of honor is dedicated to the memory of technical advisor sergeant jack vincennes
a ribbon is cut
eager motorists roll down the blacktop
ronald reagan applauds as jane wyman plunges her hands into fresh sidewalk cement
the brass exchange concerned looks and raied eyebrows as they watch exley through the glass his voice heard over the speakers
the flatnose frisco loan shark and cauliflowered cleveland enforcer seen earlier at the victory motel return to l
ready to fill the vacuum
hush hush is delivered
the headline actor reynolds in his final role conductor of the night train to slice city
exley stares across at the internal affairs detectives
thats the whole story
as exley looks to the gray tinted wall mirror
loew leans over whispers to the chief
the press would have a field day with this
a beat when in doubt feed them a hero
in this case well need more than one
cop dies defending city from organized crime
exley in his dress blue uniform
the chief smiles pins gold stars to his shoulders
captain edmund exley
chief of detectives
los angeles police department
lynn watches from the back as exley runs a handshake gauntlet
finally he spots her
shes returned to her natural brunette
looks even better
exley steps over
ironic smile i tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades
exley walks lynn out
where will you go
the airs good for pensioners and i know where everything is
right now before i back down
where is he
lynn gestures ahead
they walk to her car
she opens the back door
buds in the back
braces on his legs head sutured
jaw wired shut and tubes running in and out
but his hands still look strong
bud forces a smile through the wires tries to say something but cant
thanks for the push
exley takes his hand
bud squeezes till both men wince
you just did what you did
no rank no glory
exley slips his medal of valor into buds hand
from me to you
itll mean something if its yours
bud takes it turns away so exley wont see the tears
we should go now
as exley steps back lynn closes the door
party noises drift from upstairs
exley looks to lynn
do you think i ever couldve been in the running
some men get the world
others get ex hookers and a trip to arizona
exley wishes hed gotten the trip to arizona
she kisses him on the cheek gets in the car
exley looks back at bud
bud presses his hands to the glass
exley touches his side palms half the mans size
hands against hands
the car moves
a turn into traffic a good bye toot on the horn
exleys all alone
as he watches them go
