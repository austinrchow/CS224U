the snow covered alps stand out clearly in the light of a full moon
a fortress like chateau is situated in a flat saddle of forest partway up the mountain next to a frozen lake
the property is surrounded by high stone walls and the stately grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards with dogs
the driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars
a formal dress party is in progress
a private reception for a middle eastern dignitary
tuxedoes men escort their diamond encrusted ladies through the huge front doors where they doff their overcoats and are politely scanned with hand held metal detectors by white gloved security
the walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake forming a kind of rampart
there is an opening to a kind of waterway or canal which connects to the private docks inside the grounds
there is a steel grating across the opening
the bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter
with the house visible bg we crane down below the parapet wall along which a guard is a white exposure suit is walking
down along the dark wall to the grating
tilting down to see a glow pulsing under the ice
camera moving toward a figure in diving gear working at the metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch
one bar has already been cut out
two quick cuts and a second bar falls to the muddy bottom
lit now only from the floodlights filtering down through the ice the figure slips through the bars and swims powerfully along the stone canal wall
seem from below the figure is a black shadow moving against the rippled glass of the ice above
a dock extends into the frozen canal just behind a large boathouse
there is a faint chipping sound
the ice breaks quietly and the pieces are slid back
a head appears in a rubber drysuit hood
the diver slips the regulator out of his mouth and turns slowly scanning
revealing harry tasker
harry floats with just his eyes above the surface silent as a water snake as a guard passes on a footpath nearby
after a few beats harry slips out of his tanks and fins letting them sink and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock
he moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse
opening a waterproof bag he pulls out a walky talky
honey im home
meet harrys partner albert gib gibson an overweight twenty year man with a lived in looking face
gib answers harry via his headset
he covers the mike and turns hey fize
get your butt in here
outside fast faisil an iranian american finishes making yellow snow and hurries back to the van
they are parked on a winding mountain road a half mile from the chateau whose lights are visible through the trees
faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto nightvision scope
the eerie green image lurches as he sweeps the grounds locating the boathouse
concealed in the shadows harry is shucking out of his drysuit
underneath is he is wearing black tux pants suspenders cummerbund and a formal shirt
he puts a tiny plug like a hearing aid deep in his ear canal
a sub vocal transceiver
switching to sub vocal
gib you copy
youre on the air
harry slips into his shoulder harness
holster on one side containing his
auto glock and the transmitter pack for the ear piece slung on the other
he slips on a formal jacket concealing the rig
then a final touch
a little aftershave from a tiny plastic vial
harry adjusts his bow tie and strides confidently out of the shadows crossing quickly to the main house
he looks ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and his hair slicked back
he enters the main house through a back service entrance
harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place
the kitchen staff are scurrying around too busy to really notice
he finger tastes a dish as he passes
french subtitled this needs more garlic
he breezes through unchallenged exiting into the here the party is in full swing
harry blends smoothly into the crowd of foreign dignitaries businessman and minor mid east nobility
they are a high octane mixture of new oil money and old european money and run the spectrum from stodgy bankers to playboy arms dealers
harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman the cigar smoking men casually snagging a glass of champagne and a canape from the passing waiters
he nods to someone as if he knows them
greets another is quite fluent arabic
people in his wake look at each other like do you know him
they shrug go on with their conversation
harry moves through the crowd
theres daddy petrobucks
harrys pov through the crowd is sees jamal khaled the host of the party and owner of the chateau
he is fat and animated greeting guests with a flourish
as harry watches he warmly greets a beautiful woman
they become absorbed in a conversation
the woman glances up and sees harry checking her out
there is a frank moment of returned interest
then the crowd shifts cutting off their view of each other
harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor
he slips through doors into the private area of the mansion
the doors open and harry slips into the darkened library
he crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace
harry goes onto the terrace and in a display of acrobatic prowess he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony directly above
he lets himself into khaleds office is ornately furnished
beautiful antiques glint in the moonlight coming in the french doors
harry crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there
bathed in the glow from the screen he pulls a flat box about the size of a paperback from the back of his cummerbund
he connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the computer
modem in place
he pushes a button and a green light comes on
gib and faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with data from khaleds private computer
we are in
fast faisil is a computer ace
his fingers fly on the keyboard as he types rapid key commands
we see familiar windows appear
the words are all in arabic characters
these are encrypted files guys
this is going to take me a few minutes
tight on library door
it opens a crack and a dental mirror comes out looking around like a u boat periscope
seeing the coast is clear harry slips out
but just as he is closing the door a guard rounds the corner ten feet away
harry turns smoothly
he smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard
in arabic subtitled wheres the john around here
i have to take a major leak
the guard points warily down the corridor
harry nods and heads that way back toward the party
harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party
he is sipping champagne and looking bored
he sees two security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the stairs walkies in their hands
he turns away as they pass him and pretends to study a large fragment of bas relief
a temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses
he senses someone next to him and turns
it is the woman
she is captivatingly beautiful and her gaze is piercing
indicating the bas relief magnificent isnt it
hi im juno skinner
i thought i knew most of khaleds friends but i dont believe i know you
harry offers his hand to her
gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database
he scans rapidly for skinner
gib finds the entry hes looking for
junos picture and data appear on the screen
art and antiquities dealer specializing in ancient persia
harry turns back to the fragment of frieze
this is persian if im not mistaken
its sixth century b
do you like the period
shameless i adore it
seen through the starlight scope we see one of the guards shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on harrys footprints leading to the boathouse
he calls to one of the other guards who comes running over
harry still with juno hears gib in his ear harry we got a problem
guards are swarming all over the dock
harry glances up the stairs
khaleds security chief is gesturing to several of his men and speaking quickly into a walky
three security men come down the stairs scanning the crowd
harry turns smoothly away from them and takes junos arm
do you dance ms
he steers her toward the dance floor
gib listening rolls his eyes
he looks through the night vision scope
guards are running around outside the chateau
harrys stirred up the hornets nest
faisil is still jamming at the keyboard
okay files are unlocked
im down baby
i got my hand up her dress and im going for the gold
im just copy the goddamn files
into his headset harry dont be stopping to smell the roses now
you hear me harry
harry whirls juno aggressively across the dancefloor
she responds deftly
they are well matched
she parries each of his smooth moves with a flourish
it is a contest of wills and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy
juno is hot
he bends her back at the waist then snaps her up
she twirls into the crook of his arm
their faces are inches apart
the music ends and she gives him a wry grin
and i thought this was going to be just another bunch of boring bankers and oil billionaires
harry seconds count buddy
ditch the bitch lets go
unfortunately juno i have a plane to catch
she slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress
she hands it to him maintaining eye contact
call me if youd like to see some of my other pieces
id like that
gib cant believe this conversation
to faisil son of a bitch is with her two minutes and shes ready to bear his children to harry whats your exit strategy twinkle toes
harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides confidently through
he goes down the steps to the broad terrace above the motor court
behind harry a guard lowers his walky talky and starts after him
may i see your invitation sir
without turning harry slips a small flat box out of his breast pocket
a remote detonator
heres my invitation
he pushes the button and kaboom
the second floor office windows blow out in a fiery explosion
using the diversion harry leaps off the terrace before the guard can open fire
gib sees the rising fireball a half mile away
he starts the van
here we go harry sprints across the snow covered lawn through the trees
guards with automatic weapons run after him firing
the snow explodes around him with bullet hits
two dobermans pelt toward harry leaping at him in perfect unison
and knocks their heads together in mid leap with a crack like a baseball bat
the dogs drop to the snow wobbling around like theyre drunk
as harry sprints on another doberman lunges out of the bushes ahead leaping directly for his throat
harry grabs the dog and shot puts him up into a tree without breaking stride
the dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch looking down in amazement
harry leaps down on the outside of the wall hitting a snow bank and sliding downhill
he sprints down the gentle slope toward the highway
harry looks back as two guards on skis come out of a guard station beside the main entrance
tracking with the ski guards searching through the trees with lights
they have lost harry
a snowbank behind them explodes as harry leaps out
he disables them both with vicious street fighter moves
harry looks upslope as a service gate opens in the perimeter wall and teams of security men in white snow suits pour out some on skis some on snowmobiles
a helicopter rises over the wall in a blast of swirling snow
its xenon lights rake through the trees casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow
on harry snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one of the disabled guards
he pops the boots quickly into the bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guards fn fal rifles slung across his back
the helicopter swoops downhill its searchlight blazing through the forest
snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski patrols zig zagging among the trees
harry slashes expertly downhill
he cuts a distinguished figure in his black tux
automatic weapons fire rips through the trees from behind him
harry is going flat out
the xenon light hits him
mm machine gun in the chopper rips the slope into white clouds around him
harry slashes turns weaving among the trees at breakneck speed
a snowmobile is closing in outflanking him
he turns toward it suddenly
hits a mogul
uses the air to slash his skis right across the riders face
the snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the night
gibs van takes an icy turn in a hairy slide
inside gib is peering upslope trying to see whats going on
all he can see are lights and gunfire
harry whats your twenty
i need a position buddy suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from the slope above right over the van and lands deftly downslope
ill catch you on the next bend
behind the van pursuing guards leap across the road
only about half can make the jump
the rest crash horribly
the helicopter thunders overhead
harry sees the chopper start an attack run
he comes out into the open going straight downhill like a rocket
the chopper gets suckered in
trying to hit him getting right down behind him
and suddenly harry slides to a stop in an explosion of powder and whips up the rifle
p p p pow
he rakes a burst across the windshield
the startled pilot swerves and suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front of him
the main rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper drops into the snow plowing into a snowbank
it slides right to the edge of a steep ridge and stops teetering
firing from a snowmobile one of the guards puts a burst right across harrys path
harrys skis are hit and he tumbles comes out of it
running down the hill like a juggernaut in his heavy boots
he has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow
harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed chopper which still has its engine running
the ski patrol opens fire from upslope
rounds whacking against the disabled helicopter
harry looks down the slope and gets an idea
he jerks the unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage rocking it
it slips over the edge
he leaps inside as it topples forward and slides down the slope
harry adds throttle and works the footpedals using the tail rotor to steer
the chopper had snow skids and harry is skiing the damn thing down the mountain
the copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its skids
bullets are hitting the fuselage and everything around it
skiers are wiping out hitting trees
a snowmobile hits a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine
where are you
in the helicopter
gib slides the van around a curve
deadpan to faisil hes in the helicopter
big is scanning above for the chopper
then upslope he sees the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees
the chopper hits a jump and launches into the air it crashes through trees still soaring and gib looks up screaming as the chopper drops right toward him he hits
the brakes and blammo
it drops onto the road ten feet in front of the skidding van
then slides over the edge and tumbles into a rocky canyon where is blows up
the fireball lights up the night
gib and faisil jump out of the van
they look downslope at the burning wreckage
gib and faisil spin to look behind them
harry is lodged in tree branches hanging over the road
gib hands his mp k machine gun to faisil and reaches up to harry who grabs his hand and pulls
harry tumbles down into the snowbank
he stands brushing snow off his tux and clomps toward the van in his ski boots
he is completely unruffled
we can still make our flight
as faisil is getting into the van behind harry two guard teams on snowmobiles roar around the bend behind them fish tailing on the ice
faisil opens fire
one snowmobile swerves over the embankment
the other pulls up broadside and the guards duck behind it
gib floors it and the van roars down the mountain
faisil is still ramboing on full auto
this is great
i never get to shoot
an american airlines touches down amid puffs of tire smoke
a non descript sedan pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of modest middle income tract homes
the street is deserted
it is a
gib is at the wheel dropping harry off at his house
harry is emptying his pockets
passport business cards etc
all documents under his name renquist
he double checks that his pants and jacket pockets and empty
gib fastidiously puts the items into a plastic zip lock
gib starts handing him items from a briefcase
this should all feel like a tired ceremony between them
harry tasker wallet
harry tasker passport
plane ticket stub hotel receipt tasker
two postcards of lake geneva
souvenir snowing swiss village
gib snows him how is snows when you shake it up and turn it over
whats this for
for dana schmuck
bring your kid something
the dad thing
okay pick me up at eight
the de brief is at ten hundred
harry opens the car door
hey hey hey
what are we forgetting
gib holds up harrys gold wedding band
harry puts it on
what a team
see you at eight
harry slips inside
he sets down his suitcase and walks quietly down the hall
he pauses at a door with lurid labels and stickers plastered all over it toxic waste stay out
if its too loud youre too old etc
harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping daughter dana
she looks like an angel in the moonlight coming in the window
in fact she is a typical year old girl and therefore hardly an angel
but to harry she is unflawed
harry undressed now slips into bed next to
a lump in the covers which we presume to be a human being
this is helen tasker harrys wife of years
he kisses her on the cheek and she stirs
she rolls toward him giving him a sleepy hug and a kiss
a drowsy murmur hi honey
how was the flight
as she drifts off harry puts his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling
tight on swiss village
it is snowing
on dana reaching to the present harry just gave her
hey thanks dad
i never had one of these
they are in her room which is your basic room from hell
pearl jam posters and an unbelievable clutter of junk magazines and cheap jewelry
harry kisses her on the cheek to which she submits dutifully
he looks at his watch and heads for the door
you better hurry
youre going to be late for school
harry hurries out and dana considers the swiss village a moment
she plonks is straight in the wastebasket
harry strides down the hall avoiding their small but incredibly ugly dog gizmo who skitters past him going the other way
dana dont forget to feed gizmo
harry crosses the bedroom hurrying past helen who is clearly rushing to get ready herself
we get our first good look at helen
she is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an outfit
her hair is wrapped in a towel
to call her plain would be inaccurate
she could be attractive if she put any effort into it which doesnt occur to her
they talk without looking at each other the way people who have been together a long time do
howd it go at the trade show
you make all the other salesmen jealous
you should have seen it
we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system the one for the
how you can write up an order and the second the customers name goes into the computer it starts checking their credit and if theyve ordered anything in the past
and if they get a discount
she is already tuning him out
and it hits us she has no barely listening thats fabulous harry
yeah it was wild
harry glances at her oblivious to him and brushing her teeth
the best lies are told with enthusiasm
gib opens the door knocks a bit then strolls in like he lives there
he is wearing dark ray bans like hes doing a roy orbison impression
gizmo runs toward him yapping but gib gives him the evil eye
come any closer ill kill you
the dog backs up whining plaintively
gib throws his jacket over the back of the couch and then inexplicably he takes out a pack of camels and sets it on the mantelpiece
he adjusts its position carefully
harry and helen maneuver around each other expertly
she is doing her make up
the plumber came yesterday
he said they have to dig under the slab or something and its going to be six hundred dollars to fix
harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in front of the mirror
his mind is elsewhere
he couldnt care less about there domestic problems
its not okay
what did you tell him
i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks
good thinking honey
harry kisses her on the cheek and exits
gib enters and pours two cups of coffee
dana is drinking orange juice from the bottle at the fridge
she exits eating an uncooked pop tart
harry comes in a second later and gib hands him his coffee
here check these out
gib hands harry the glasses
harry studies them seeing the virtual video display inside the left lens of the ray bans
harry glances down the hall making sure no one is looking then he puts them on
harrys pov inside the glasses a black and white video image of his own living room
the ccd camera and transmitter and inside a pack of smokes
slick little unit huh
in pov we see dana enter the living room
she looks around carefuly then quickly lifts gibs jacket and slips out his wallet
she palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts the wallet back
son of a bitch
harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen
gib goes after him
dana comes out the front door letting it slam behind her and runs to her boyfriend trent who is waiting for her in the driveway on his idling yamaha
trent is dressed in grunge rock style trying to look tough
harry comes out the front door as trent revs the motor
she waves from the back of the bike as trent pops the clutch and they shoot down the driveway
yelling over the engine cant stop im late
they are driving through d
harry is still shocked by his daughters behavior
ten seconds of joy
thirty years of misery
she knows not to steal
ive taught her better than that
yeah but youre not her parents anymore you and helen
her parents are axl rose and madonna
the five minutes you spend a day with her cant compete with that kind of constant bombardment
youre outgunned amigo
gib and harry turn onto pennsylvania avenue heading toward lafayette square
capital hill is behind them
harry and gib come out of an elevator on the th floor
behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads tektel systems
they cross a open floor of cubicle spaces
there is the hum of activity everywhere
a normal day at a normal business
see kids now are ten years ahead of where we were at the same age
you probably think shes still a virgin dont be ridiculous
shes only how old is she
shes only fourteen
they go into a corridor
and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm
i say even money that physicist on the bike is boinkin her
they stop at a door like any other along the corridor
it is blank
de nail aint just a river in egypt
shes probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion
will you just open the door
gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the doorknob
there is the clunk of a solenoid lock
they enter a long corridor which is featureless except for video surveillance cameras
they walk along the silence for a moment then
twenty here fifty there
i figured my wifes boyfriend was taking it
i thought you moved out
i moved back in
my lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement
dont change the subject
you owe me two hundred bucks
they approach another door with a bulletproof glass window in it
beyond is a brightly lit room with a woman sitting at a desk
and nothing else
gib presses a buzzer
janice sits at the non descript desk like a receptionist
but she is a highly trained security specialist
she is also hefty through the shoulders aggressively unattractive and utterly humorless
she watches them on a monitor screen as they stand outside the door
harry and gib appear as living x ray images
their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses
janice puts one hand automatically on the butt of a
tucked in a holster riveted beneath her desk
she buzzes harry and gib in with the other
gentlemen please idenitify yourselves to the scanner
harry and gib step up to the combination retinal thumbprint voice scanners
harry presses his thumb against a black glass plate for laser scan and looks into the eye piece of the retinal scanner
one zero zero two four
three four nine nine one
their clearance appears on a monitor on janices desk
you are cleared
she stands to give them plastic i
badges which they hang around their necks
janice how many years have you been buzzing us in
and you still reach for your piece every time
you have no idea how much that turns me on
ive never had the courage to say this before but
i love you janice
he kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by
she does not react is any discernible way
they pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens automatically
beyond is a kind of airlock
a sally port
behind a lexan shield are two guards armed with mp s
they nod but do not speak at harry and gib pass them
you better watch it
she might file on you for sexual harassment
in her dreams
gib and harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium
angle from above as they cross
a huge graphic logo covers the floor
across the center is says omega sector
in smaller print around the perimeter is the motto the last line of they enter a high tech office space
it is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor space of cubicles
there is a hushed quality here
people do not joke
they do not hurry
there are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world
it looks like a combination of nasa mission control and fbi headquarters
fast faisil greets them yawning as they pass his partitioned cubicle
come on fize
were late for our butt grinding
faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them
a dark and severe conference room with large screen computer displays at one end
glowering at one end of the long polished table is spencer trilby the chief of omega sector
visualize a cross between colin powel and j
you guys really screwed the pooch last night
please tell me how i can look at this that its not a total pooch screw
total is a strong word there are degrees of totality
its a scale really with perfect mission on one end and total pooch screw on the other and were more about here faisil
youre new on harrys team arent you
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you
heres what we got
he hits a button and a photo of khaled fills a wall screen
we think hes dirty so we raid his financial files
check it out
faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the data for their raid
one hundred million in wire transfers from the commerce bank which we all know is a front for certain nations to fund terrorist activities
something big is going down and we know that a week ago four mirv warheads were smuggled out of the former soviet republic of kazakhstan
we think khaleds group has bought the nukes and is bringing them to u
so far this is not blowing my skirt up gentleman
do you have anything remotely substantial
dont be pumping beets up my ass here
do you have hard data
not what youd call rock hard
its pretty limp actually
then perhaps you better get some before somebody parks a car in front of the white house with a nuclear weapon in the trunk
it is the interior of a huge law office
helen works there as a paralegal
she is going to the break room for coffee with her friend allison a secretary
allison is black younger then helen and still single
i mean its not like hes saving the world or anything
hes a sales rep for chrissakes
whenever i cant get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day
six seconds and im out
but he acts like hes curing cancer or something
so i guess you didnt get away for the weekend after all
are you kidding
harry had to go out of town
you know harry
helens nerdy boss brad comes up behind her scowling
helen have you pulled those files yet
i need them by lunch
i wont let you down brad
under her breath you little pencil neck
to allison so
dyou do anything interesting
eric and i drove up to this little romantic inn and
pretty much lapped champagne out of each others navels for two days
girlfriend you got a man
you just have to take control
set up the right mood
harry only has two moods busy
then you better do something to jumpstart that mans motor
wake up the sleeping giant of his passion
they both crack up at that one
harry meets up with gib and faisil coming from the analysis department
the following will play as they wind their way through the rows of data analysis workstations
handing harry a printout here check this out its a two million dollar disbursement from khaled to
harry raises an eyebrow uh huh
the babe at the party
it doesnt mean anything
she buys antiquities for khaled
the art buys are in a separate ledger
and this is a little above market rate for the horizontal bop even for a total biscuit like her
alright i want a complete workup on her
do we know where she is
right here in river city
she lives in rome but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections so she has offices here
gib starts tangoing with an imaginary partner
sounds like a job for a specialist
harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re heating
he sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the saran wrap off the plate
another solo supper two hours late
his motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule not the exception
helen comes in from the living room holding the suspense novel she is reading
i need you to talk to dana
the vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon
ill handle it
harry picks up his porkchop and goes out the back door
a basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and dana is shooting baskets in the driveway
moths orbit the outside floodlights
she sinks one dribbled back to the foul line
harry comes up behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands poised to shoot
why werent you in class today
i was there
i was in the nurses office cause i had a headache
you seem fine now
youre going to believe that fat dweeb mr
hardy over your own daughter
im not sure what to believe anymore young lady
you never used to lie to me
but lately you dont seem to know the difference between right and wrong
dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a fingernail
dana are you listening to me
you know you can always talk to me
whatever is going on in your life your mom and ill understand
youd tell me if there was something wrong wouldnt you pumpkin
im not a pumpkin
do i look even remotely like a pumpkin
im not a muffin or a cupcake or a honeybear either
and you dont understand anything dad
dana runs into the house agent
hold on harry superagent unable to comprehend the mind of a year old
he looks up to see helen at the backdoor
macho voice ill handle it
a black limo cruises through a morning fill of bright promise
inside gib is at the wheel in a chauffeurs uniform
he talks to harry riding in the back without turning
its all set up
ghost phones and fax all the usual stuff
you have a suite at the marquis hotel under renquist
okay reality check
hi im harry renquist
i own a corporate art consulting company in san francisco
i have an appointment with ms
skinner harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor
she is dressed sharply and looks as stunning as harry remembers
i thought i might see you again
i just didnt except you to call so soon
juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake
well whats the point of waiting
there is definitely unholy magnetism here
she indicates for harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of offices
there are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in niches on either side and beautifully restored mosaics and tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters
they want something
i spoke to a number of people who said youre the one to see
juno leads harry through a door into a large warehouse area
there is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates
an overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces
there are massive columns and statues two stories high
even the entire facade of a tomb
so what did these
say about me exactly
they stroll amongst the statues as coveralled workmen move around them with tools scaffolding pneumatic equipment
most of the workers are middle eastern
that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words
and that other dealers and archeologists dont like you much
its because i use my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike
yelling in arabic to two workmen i told you to move those crates an hour ago
come on guys lets get going
we realize that a workman is watching them intently from nearby
he is an intense looking middle eastern man in his mid thirties
you see a lot of these pieces are from ancient persia
unfortunately ancient persia is twenty feet under the sand of iran iraq and syria
not the most popular places lately
so ive had to become an expert in international diplomacy
juno stops and looks at harry
her smile indicates the possibility of more than just business
well do you see anything you like mr
harry gib and fast faisil are in a luxury suite at the marquis hotel
it is a corner suite with a spectacular view of the city
faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an electronic detector
shes importing stuff from all over the mid east
she could be moving money guns
and the second you left there we started getting calls to the ghost numbers
they were checking out the renquist front
lets step up the surveillance on her
put on two more guys
we follow the workman we saw watching harry earlier
he catches up with juno who is going through the doors to the office area
his name is malik
can i speak to you for a moment please in your office
his manner is self effacing
he doesnt meet her gaze
she nods and they go into the private office
malik comes in behind her and closes the door
the moment they are away from public observation his manner changes
his humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he approaches her
without warning he slaps her hard across the you stupid undisciplined bitch
her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive
its a good thing you pay me well
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now
your phones are almost certainly tapped
and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist who may be a no
he checked out okay malik slaps her again
that is for interrupting
he backhands her and that is for being wrong
we do not tolerate mistakes
juno bites her lip
what do you want me to do

the phone rings on the desk of charlene harrys secretary at tektel systems the permanent front company for omega sector
hello tektel systems
helen is in the kitchen showing dana how to put icing on a large birthday cake
is he there
charlene doesnt hesitate a microsecond
harrys in a sales meeting mrs
let me try him in there
she punches a key engaging a digital scrambler and connecting to a phone rings
gib opens his briefcase and looks at the console of the cellular scrambler phone inside
the display reads tektel caller id pos tasker helen
harry picks up the phone
intercut the following with helen
whats going on
sorry to bother you in a meeting but you have to promise me that youll be home at eight
i dont want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year
laughing baby i said id be there
the room phone rings gotta go honey
harry raises an eyebrow as he answers
oh juno hi
pause well sure
i can be there in twenty minutes
harry hangs up
gib checking his watch has a look like hes got a bad gas pain
its on the way
she says shes got something for me
a workman guides harry through the maze of statuary
he points toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves
harry is left alone in the vast space
only a few lights are on rendering the place somewhat gothic
harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed
ahead of him is the huge facade of a royal tomb
there is a flickering light inside
a shadow moves across the wall in the entryway
he enters the stone doorway of the tomb
following harry as he steps into the inner chamber
there is an oil lamp burning on a stone sarcophagus the only light
the room appears empty
reverse on harry
behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed alcove
it is juno
she looks ethereal in the strange light
harry whips around startled
do you like my tomb
the museum financing fell out so i thought your clients might be interested
especially in this light
this is the only light they had then so i like to study it this way
i love this place
i love all ruins
is that why you got into this business
juno turns to him in the flickering half light
she moves closer
her eyes seem to glitter
ive always been a collector at heart
when i see something i want i have to have it
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants
she is very close to him
her eyes seem to glitter in the light from the oil lamp
she is unbelievably beautiful
yes i do
gib is sitting in the car in the shadows up the street
with his earphone in place
harry this is your conscience speaking
juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall holding it up so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas relief figures to life
stone faces shift and change stone eyes move
look at this
people who dies twenty centuries ago
juno presses her cheek against the cold stone
she runs her fingers slowly across the figures
it is strange and erotic
they breathed and loved and wept just like us
and now their ideals their religions their social orders
are gone like mist
what did any of it matter
she crosses to harry
i only hope they lived well
that they got what they wanted
she puts her hands on him and pulls herself close
it is a hypnotic moment
getting what you want is the only important thing
she kisses him very lightly with infinite sensuality
listen to the following code word
h e l e n
now do you want me to i beep you
harry breaks the kiss
slowly pulling back
uh yes it is important
juno is moving in for a more passionate lip lock when beep beep beep
harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at it
the moment is spoiled
uh it looks like i have to run
ill call you tomorrow
your proposal is very interesting
gib lets out a big exhale of relief
he looks at his watch
helen and dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room table
there is a big cake and presents piled on the buffet
the food is getting cold
helen looks at her watch
harry is changing clothes getting ready to be harry tasker again as gib drives through evening traffic
gib keeps checking the rearview
we have a friend
five cars back inside lane
theyve been on us since we left junos
harry adjusts the passenger side mirror
want me to lose them
we need this lead
into his rover unit seven
into rover i need you at the georgetown mall in three minutes
helens going to be pissed
see thats the problem with terrorists
theyre really inconsiderate when it comes to peoples schedules
there are three men in the car
yusif and mahmoud are in the front with mahmoud driving
in the back shadowed we can just make out abu malik
yusif is massively built with a body like a beer keg
mahmoud is skinny and intense
harry puts his sub vocal transceiver into his ear canal
test two three
gib nods receiving pull over here
gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance
half a block behind them the station wagon does the same
harry slips on the virtual image sunglasses and gets out of the car
harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette
he coughs slightly
in his ear you dont smoke dickhead
harry lets his hand drop to his side holding the pack of cigarettes casually
he turns his hand
the tiny lens in the cigarette pack glints
pov video screen inside the left lens of the glasses
the camera in the cigarette pack reveals yusif and mahmoud getting out of their cars crossing the street half a block away
harry strolls into the mall
it is an open promenade design with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie goers
harry watches in the glasses as mahmoud and yusif slip through the crowd behind him
whats the plan
apparently mumbling to himself gonna try to get a closer shot of beavis butthead
gib looks in the rearview studying the car behind him
theres another guy still in the car
on radio stay on him
all gib can see is a silhouette in the car
a soft cherry glow the tip of a cigarette in the dark
harry turns off the main concourse into a narrower walkway between shops
in the video glasses he watches yusif and mahmoud who have split up to look less conspicuous as they track him through the pedestrian traffic
gib in on the cellular phone
hi its gib
harry remembered something he left at the office
you know harry
as he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the station wagon
she sighs fatalistically
i know harry
helen hangs up the phone just as dana strides through the room putting on a jacket and heading for the front door
where are you going
if dad doesnt care enough about us to be here on his birthday then why should i care
im going to a movie
no youre not
youre going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake
mom wake up
dad barely knows we exist
we see the hurt in her eyes
she doesnt hate her father
she just misses him
thats not true honey it is true
he doesnt know anything about me
he still thinks im like ten years old or something
as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says like his good little fantasy daughter he thinks everythings fine
but its not fine
dana runs out the kitchen by the other door
helen runs after her
come back here
the slamming door is her answer
yusif sees harry up ahead enter a public restroom
he signals mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on the restroom
gib hangs up the car phone
ten the bus blocking his view finally pulls away and gib see that the station wagon is empty
into his headset harry i lost the third guy
harry cant answer because mahmoud just entered the room behind him
harry is at one of the urinals apparently taking a leak
mahmoud goes to the mirror
starts combing his hair
he doesnt much notice the pack of camels sitting on the counter nearby
harry is whistling
harrys pov in the video glasses harry sees himself and mahmoud
yusif comes into the restroom seemingly ignoring both harry and mahmoud as if heading for the stalls
as he passes behind harry he reaches into his coat harry spins lightning fast
he knocks away the silenced pistol aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block capturing yusifs arm in an arm lock
the shot goes wide shattering a urinal
harry slams his palm into yusifs face like a piledriver and spins him against the steel stalls
the silenced pistol goes skittering across the floor
mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband
still holding the bear like yusif harry draws his glock so fast we can barely see him move
slugs go through mahmouds chest shattering the mirror behind him
he flops on his butt slumping against the wall
yusif who is easily harrys size bellows and grabs his gun arm
they smash against the walls struggling for the gun
yusif locked to harry hurls him against the stalls
they hit a locked door which pops open banging inward
yusif drives harry to the floor
harrys head is between the shoes of an old guy sitting on the can who looks down uncomprehendingly at him
yusif slams harrys gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe of the stall
he twists harrys wrist brutally
he even pounds against harrys hand with his knee
the old guy winces
thats got to hurt
harry cries out in pain and the gun drops
yusif reaches for it but harry kicks it under the stalls
he punches yusif in the face driving him back
they grapple spinning
harry drives yusifs head into the counter
then he elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy floor
harry grabs yusifs hair and pounds his face repeatedly against the rim of a urinal
in case you havent noticed this is a messy nasty fight
survival is like that
yusif sags into submission
harry pulls a nylon zip strip out of his pocket and uses it like hand cuffs securing yusifs wrists
gib is running full out drawing his gun
he has one finger jammed in his ear
his gut is doing the rumba as he runs
harry you copy
harry is pulling yusif to his feet when the door bangs open behind him
he turns thinking it is gib
malik raises a full auto beretta f and opens fire
harry spins yusif between him and the machine pistol
yusifs beer keg body stops the spray of mm slugs form hitting harry long enough for him to dive into a stall
malik hoses the room with the beretta
the metal stalls are riddled with hits
harry is in the stall with the old guy whos just sitting there
the walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on the far side
harry reaches under the stall retrieving his glock
malik goes empty
harry hears that and pops out cranking off rounds malik is a blur going out the door as harrys shots shatter tiles on the doorframe
to the old guy sorry
moving with malik who backs rapidly away from the restroom reloading
malik spins to see gib nearby going into a firing stance behind a light standard
the terrorist doesnt hesitate
his beretta roars at rounds per minute
gib tries to hide behind the light standard which is about half as wide as he is
shots hit all around him shattering window glass behind him
his stomach sticks out from behind the pole
he sucks it in
now his butt is sticking out on the other side
shots clang into the steel column and riddle everything behind him
just when it looks like gib is going to get a mm tummy tuck malik turns and sprints away through shocked pedestrians
harry runs out of the restroom trying for a shot but there are too many people in the line of fire and malik knows it
get back to the car
gib nods and heads the other way as harry takes off after malik
malik is fast and vicious
he hurls people out of the way sending shoppers sprawling
harry is ruthless in his pursuit
they pound through the mall and out onto the street malik sprints straight into traffic
a car screeches not stopping in time
malik goes right over the hood
harry leaps over the hoods of cars after him
malik sees harry coming after him like a juggernaut
he turns and sees a motorcyclist coming down the street accelerating from a right turn
malik runs at him clothes lining him right off the bike
the terrorist picks up the nimble little kawasaki which is still running and leaps on
he pops the clutch and takes off
harry pounds after him like a locomotive
he sees malik turn taking the bike path into a large park
harry cuts into the park on a diagonal
on harry running
ahead is a mounted cop
harry doesnt break stride heading right for the cop on the horse
the cop turns surprised a split second before harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground hes wearing a helmet
federal officer in pursuit of suspect
harry is in the saddle and galloping after malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him
malik roars through the park on the kawasaki
he looks back amazed to see harry charging after him on a horse
they scatter joggers and bicyclists people walking their dogs
tracking with them as they rocket through the park
malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees
harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling
malik fires his beretta straight back at harry emptying it
he drops the pistol and crouches over the bike twisting the last bit of throttle out of it
they are going flat out through the trees in a kinetic blur
gib panting and heaving pulls his car into traffic
the unit seven car pulls out as well up the block
harry whats your twenty
harry is legging the police horse hard
he has his reigns in one hand his glock in the other
its the wild west
westbound in the park
suspect is on a motorcycle
hes going to come out on franklin
hang on harry leaps a park bench like hes in a steeple chase
i want you on th in case he turns south
and i need seven on the north side to box him in
gib is weaving furiously through traffic
he slides into a turn
and make it fast
my horse is getting tired
on gib mouthing your horse
malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street
cars skid around him out of control
he turns south
weaving through traffic
harry leaps the hedgerow behind malik and gallops among the spun out cars
he goes right over the hood on one which is blocking his path
the driver ducks as the horses hoof cracks the windshield
up ahead traffic is stopped jammed tight at a light
malik goes into the oncoming traffic lanes which are empty
gibs car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes barrelling down the street toward him
gib cranks the wheel the slides the car broadside blocking both lanes
malik locks up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop
then the terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around jumping the curb and going straight at the entrance of the hyatt bellmen and guests scatter as the bike
roars right at them
the sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with bags and malik blasts past him into the lobby
harry ducks galloping through the doors after him
acres of marble and red carpet
guests dressed for evening the men in suits diamonds on the women
and sudden pandemonium as malik roars through the lobby with harry charging along behind him
malik guns it across the lounge knocking over tables
he gets air at the top of the steps going up to the restaurant
harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself careening toward the jazz quartet at a full gallop
he gathers the animal and leaps in glorious slow motion over the bassist who is diving for the carpet
harry and horse land deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after malik
malik roars between the tables looking around wildly for a way out
harry charges in ducking to avoid the chandelier
waiters trays dinners tables
everything seems to be flying at once as people dive out of the way
malik skids out into the main hall by another door and sees the elevators
the door is just closing on one of them
he guns it and slides through the doors
harry rides out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of malik as the doors close
harry canters the horse into the next elevator which has just been boarded by an older couple
he has to practically lie down on the horse to fit through the door
the animal barely fits nose to tail in what turns out to be a glass elevator with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel as it rises right
to the top of the building
harry looks through the glass at the elevator car next to him fifteen feet away
malik is inside punching a button
he glances up and sees harry
there eyes meet for a moment just before maliks car ascends rapidly
maliks malevolent glare is etched on harrys retinas
the older couple is jammed against the side wall by harrys panting snorting horse
it clomps around the tight elevator
the woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall
can you just press the top floor please
the man nods mutely and complies
their elevator takes off rising after maliks
gib runs in with faisil and keough
they follow the path of destruction growing more and more amazed
gib yells to one of the porters
the guy on the horse
the porter points at the elevators
harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel
he can look up at an angle and see malik in the car above him
his thumb hovers over the emergency stop button
if malik gets out at any floor harry will have a moment to react and stop
malik can look down and see this
he knows harrys got him
he just keeps going floor after floor using the time to think
the older woman is still just staring trying not to breathe
the horse flicks her in the face with his tail
the rooftop has a spectacular view of the city
tracking with malik as he comes out of the elevator rides to the far edge of the roof and slides to a stop
he looks down twenty stories
the second elevator arrives
the doors part and harry comes out with his glock poised and ready
he sees malik revving his bike
the terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof
amazingly he increases speed roaring right off the edge arcing the harry rides to the edge in time to see malik on his bike clear a foot jump and splash
into the rooftop pool of a lower building next to the hotel
harry is out of control now seeing the guy setting away
he wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some running space
then he turns again back toward the edge malik jumped from
he kicks the horses flanks and yells haahh
the horses hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt toward the edge
but a horse is not a motorcycle
it is slightly smarter
it slams its front hoofs down together stopping suddenly
harry goes right over its head
he flies forward almost going right off the roof
he slams to the edge with his legs dangling over holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand
his glock tumbles down into darkness
harry sees malik far below climb out of the pool running to the roof door of the other building
harry clambers up onto his own roof breathing hard
he walks over to the horse
what the hell were you thinking
we had the guy and you let him get away
he looks into the horses innocent brown eyes
pats its neck fondly
what kind of cop are you
helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half eaten cake and some melted ice cream
his unopened presents are piled at one end of the table
she raises her head as harry enters sheepishly
look i know youre upset
im really sorry honey
i raced home as quick its okay dont bother harry
he goes to her and puts his arms around her
he is tender with her
he wishes he can tell her the truth
thank you for the party
it was great
helen finds a smile for him somewhere
she really does love him though more and more often lately she finds her heart in pain
lets go to bed harry
theres only one present you have to open tonight
she grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully
helen walks harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down
she puts her hand on his chest and pushes causing him to lie back
ill be right back
she turns on the stereo
a kenny g disc she put in there earlier
soft tenor sax flows around the room
helen enters the bathroom and shuts the door partway
she opens a cupboard and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier
a bottle of champagne on ice
some trashy lingerie
come on to bed you dont have to brush your teeth
ill just be a second
so what happened tonight at the office
i couldnt believe it
i go back to get this report i need right and the phone is ringing so like a bonehead i answer it helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar
g string panties and low cut bra
she holds up the garter belt turning it backward and forward trying to figure out which way it goes
on harry yawning
lying with the ease of years of practice
its the big client in japan and its the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed
this guys having a meltdown keeping him talking whatd you do honey
well i pull out the manual on their setup which is the new server
helen is pulling up the black stockings
she fastens the garters to the tops
her features are a scowl of concentration
she is very earnest in her preparations
and im troubleshooting it with them over the phone
talking to a translator right whos getting half of it wrong
it was unbelievable
putting on black pumps it sounds wild
so now youre a big hero right
for fixing their system
faintly uh huh
my husband the hero
then she puts a little perfume on her wrists
ill be right there honey
just a minute
harry doesnt answer
helen puts a little perfume down the front of her panties
just a second
helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne
then she slinks around the doorframe making her entrance
she looks like a living number
helen stands before the bed looking down holding the champagne glasses
on harry sprawled on the bed fully clothed snoring softly
a little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth
hold on helen all dressed up with no place to go
she gazes down at him her shoulders slumping
happy birthday harry
she sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp
it is the following morning
harry and gib are staked out watching the front of danas school
actually harry is staked out scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars
gib just keeps looking at his watch
he picks up a cellular phone and pretends to call the office
hey did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet
cause apparently thats the only way were going to catch the son of a bitch not listening okay
here she comes
harrys pov through binoculars we see dana come out to the curb and meet trent who pulls up on his bike
she gets on behind him adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he launches out into traffic
harry who is behind the wheel pulls out after her
trent weaves radically through the light traffic going in between the cars
look at the way the little punk is driving
hes all over the place
look he hasnt signalled once
harry speeds up
somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay with trent
on dana and trent as she looks back and sees harry following her
she is mortified that her father is actually tailing her oh my god
i think thats my dad
trent downshifts and punches it
the nimble little bike screams as it zips between cars
clenching his jaw so you wanna play huh
you little rolling his eyes thats it
get im harry he draws a pistol well teach that little puke not to signal
back on trent whos actually a really good rider
he zig zags through the cars cutting between them at the next light where gib and harry get blocked
he cuts a sharp right turn and disappears
harry is stuck in stopped traffic
he pounds the wheel in frustration
exploding with laughter ha
the little prick ditched you
that is so goddamn funny
son of a bitch
can we go to the office now mr
harry is sitting at a computer workstation lit by the monitor screen
gib and faisil look on as he clicks through headshots of known terrorists
harry is very focussed
he goes back one
studies the face
a defiant looking syrian with a full beard
harry holds up his hand blocking out the beard concentrating on the eyes
harry slaps photos down in front of trilby
abu kaleem malik
reading from a file hardcore highly fanatical ultra fundamentalist
linked to numerous car bombings that cafe bomb in rome and the out of lisbon last year
now hes formed his own splinter faction called crimson jihad
guess he thought the other terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste
they call him the sand spider
he shrugs probably because it sounds scary
this is impressive gentlemen
of course it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was
well get him
meaning you damn well better harry i still want you in charge even though your cover is blown
just keep a low profile
he slaps a newspaper on the table i generally prefer it when my covert operations dont make the front page
the agents look at the headlines wild west chase
harry and gib wince
harry and gib pull to the curb in front of the building
whats going on
harry gets out of the car and turns back leaning in the door to talk to gib
ive got to talk to helen about this thing with dana
im just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch
you want me to just hang
just hang a minute
ill just hang then shall i
harry enters the office of helens firm
he stops at reception
just a second ill buzz helen
no id like to surprise her
thanks i know where her desk is
he smiles and breezes past her before she has a chance to object
tracking with harry as he moves through the offices
he passes through a library like maze of records stacks
through them he can see helen at her desk
but as he approaches still concealed allison puts a call on hold and whips around to helen
grinning conspiratorially its your mystery man
helen normally the image of composure goes suddenly fluttery and nervous as a high school girl
she takes the phone turning away from allison
pause its all right
theres no one around
helen glimpses allison with her ears cocked and gives her a scowl and a shooing motion
allison turns away grinning
on harry behind the stacks reacting
he silently mouths you mean right now
she looks around guiltily i guess so
ill be right there
i cant wait
she hangs up a little flushed
then turns to allison
can you cover me for an hour
just an hour
you should tell this stud to take more time
will you shutup
i should never have told you about him
helen grabs her purse and rushes out going right past the stack where harry is standing dumbfounded
he looks like he was slammed in the stomach with a lead pipe
his whole like is unravelling
gib sees harry crossing the street holding his stomach
he seems dazed
he is not so much walking to the car as wandering in its general direction
he stops in the street
gib gets out of the car and rushes to him
he pulls him out of the path of a bus which is honking irritably
you look like you got gut kicked
whats the matter
harry leans against the car for support
barely audible he helen
helen its helen
its helen gib
something to do with helen is what im getting
shes having an affair
harrys best friend in the world brightens with the news
he slaps him on the back
welcome to the club
it cant be
nobody believes it can happen to them
it cant be
same thing happened to me with wife two
i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty
i mean empty
she even took the ice cube trays from the fridge
what kind of person would think of that
not listening i still dont believe it
helen still loves you
she just wants this guy to bang her
its nothing serious
youll get used to it after a harry wheels around on gib grabbing him by the lapels and slams him against the car
we see in harrys rage frustration and hurt confusion a vulnerability we never expected to see
whatdya expect harry
shes a flesh and blood woman
and youre never there
it was only a matter of time
his friend is right
gib opens the car door and helps him in like an invalid talking soothingly the whole time i say we concentrate on work
thats how i always got through it whenever my life turned to dogshit
lets catch some terrorists and then you can beat the crap out of them
youll feel better
gib gets in and starts the car full of stoic cheer for harry
cant live with em
cant kill em
harry and gib are in the listening room
banks of tape decks recording calls rows of technicians in cubicles processing and collating transcripts
hes giving us a blank check on wiretaps
so ive set em up on all of junos shipping agents her clients and faisil made up a list of possible contacts that crimson jihad might have in this country
now all we can do is wait he notices harry is not listening
is this national security stuff boring you
put a tap on her phone
whatre you talking about
we have that
her office line and the line at my house
gib gives harry a stricken look and glances around nervously
he pulls him into an empty office
a whispered hiss okay
i have two words to describe that idea
unauthorized wiretap is a felony pard
harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall his teeth clenched
yeah and we do it twenty times a day
dont give me that crap
just put on the taps
im on it
harry releases him and turns away
gib straightens his jacket looking at his friend like hes completely losing it
that night harry is actually there on time for dinner
he glances at dana who has been eyeing him warily
she looks at her peas
how was school today
harry takes a bite of his food watching her
helen glances at him
you came by to see me today
she is a too casual masking her nervousness
i was in the area and i thought you might like to have lunch
they mustve just missed me
they said you had to run out
it was a rush thing
they needed some documents down at the court house
i barely made it
harry watches her lying to him with some amazement
you can see the jaw muscles clenching
so a little excitement in an otherwise dull day
did is work out okay
she gets up suddenly ill get some more gravy
she has eaten about four bites
harry sits at the table alone
he feels isolated knowing that everybody is lying to everybody else
he is a man without a center lost
tracking along the bank of recorders
harry comes to a particular set of machines
he reaches past the technician and picks up the hard copy of the transcripts
on harry walking and leafing through the phone transcripts
gib watches him through a glass partition shaking his head slowly
harry freezes staring at the page and we hear the hello
is it safe to talk
a man in his mid thirties sitting in a car someplace day speaks into a cellular phone
this is simon
he is dark haired and fairly good looking in an off beat way
he is unshaven and his clothes look slept in
he glances around in a furtive manner
i cant talk long
can you meet me for lunch tomorrow
i must see you
now we see helen at her office
i suppose so
the same place
i have to go now
see you tomorrow
remember i need you
the last line is played on harry reading
now he is seeing the proof in black and white
he slowly crumples the paper in one hand his expression dark
helen is reading in bed
she glances up as harry comes into the room
gives him a quick smile
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow
i cant honey
i promised allison id go shopping with her
harry watches her smoothly lying to him
its surreal to him
he surreptitiously picks up helens purse from a dresser and goes into the hall
the front door opens and harry comes out walking gizmo on a leash
harry walks briskly along the sidewalk jerking the poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go
he reaches gibs car half a block up and hands him helens purse
gib eyes the dog warily
he growls at it
gizmo hides behind harrys legs
i know this is rough
i felt the same way the first time it happened to harry holds up one finger
his eyes and expression are so intense gib just soft of trails off
hefting the purse so
the usual right
gps locator telemetry burst transmitter audio transmitter power supply
just have is back in two hours
thru omitted tight on the purse sitting on the seat next to her as helen drives through the city
harry drives while gib watches a computerized map below the dash
helens purse appears as a moving blip on a street map of the city
okay shes turning on seventeenth
make a left you should see her
harry makes the turn
there she is
up ahead they see helens red accord pulling into a parking low next to a cafe
harry parks the car a block away and gets out his binoculars
harrys pov through the scope
helen gets out of her car and looks around as she walks to the cafe
it is not a nervous look but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed
she goes inside
give me audio
gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch rush come over a speaker
the restaurant is nothing fancy
a little dark
helen makes her way to a booth in the back
sitting in the shadows facing the door is simon
she sits down opposite him
he doesnt smile or kiss her in greeting but glances around the room like he expects a threat to leap out at any moment
are you sure you werent followed
i kept looking back like you taught me
i didnt see anyone
its just things are a bit hot for me right now
if i get a signal
holds up a cigarette lighter meaningfully i may have to leave suddenly
its my job to risk my life but not yours
i feel bad about bringing you into this but youre the only one i can trust
simon creates an atmosphere of danger
his haggardness give him an air of mystery and desperation
where were you
we say op
and this one got a little rough
worse than cairo
cairo was a day at the beach next to this
harry and gib turn to each other shocked with the dawning awareness
guys a spook
yeah but for who
he could be working her to get to you
harry waves his hand silencing gib
simon puts a newspaper on the table sliding it over to helen
did you read the papers yesterday
sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation
see two men killed in a restroom and two unidentified men in a running shootout ending at the marriot
harry and gib react realizing that it is the story of their operation gone awry
that was you
you recognized my style
see youre very good
youre a natural at this
harry starts to get it
then is dawns on gib
the guys a fake
hes taking credit for our moves
helen leans close to simon
she clearly is hanging on his every word
tell me what happened
im sorry i cant
you can trust me completely
but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things
right of course
i was worried when i didnt hear from you that night
i knew i was in a womans thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins
harry reacts to the outrageous fabrication
but helen is eating it up
were they trying to kill you
three of them
hardly worth talking about
two wont bother me again
and you chased one
something came over me i just had nail him no matter what the risk
it was pretty hairy
i thought he had me a couple of times
but i really cant take credit
its the training
it shapes you into a lethal instrument
you react without thinking
harry and gib guffaw
this is too much
im starting to like this guy
harry shoot him a hard look
holding up his hand defensively we still have to kill him thats a given
back to helen and simon as she leans even closer
what is it you want me to do
ill call you and well rendezvous again
he looks around we have to leave separately so we arent seen together
for your safety
youll call me then
thru omitted simon is cruising in the corvette with the radio blasting
thinking he is supercool
simon pulls into a used car lot which is a run down place
a hodge podge of makes and models a few that might aspire to be classics
simon backs the vette into an open space on the front line
he reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing the sale price of the car
he sticks it back on the dash
the car doesnt even belong to him
harry and gib pull up
they watch as simon jumps out of the vette and goes into the sales office
laughing hes a goddamn used car salesman
this just gets better
catching himself sorry harry i know this is painful
harrys eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the street
tight on a tape player with simons hand adjusting the volume
the sound of traffic noise and middle eastern music blares from the deck
pull back to see simon on the phone talking loud as if over the din of a real place
its a great little bar amanda youd love it
beiruts a great place if you know the city
listen this isnt a secure line
ill tell you all about it when i get back tomorrow
if i live
except of you during this the owner of the place doug wurtz has come out of the back room and looked out at the lot
what doug sees is harry browsing among the cars
doug turns from the window and bears down on simon who sees him coming and speeds up his rap
i have to go baby
a guys coming toward me doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the cradle
simon look out there
you see that man
notice how hes looking at the cars
hes called a customer
i know its been a while but do you remember what youre supposed to do when we have a customer
simon bounces jauntily up to harry talking before hes even reached him
it wants you too
feel it vibrate
how about a little spin
simon opens the passenger door and sits harry inside then runs around the car
he leaps over the closed door into the drivers seat and starts the car
you gotta jump in
thats rule number one
it takes a little practice but theres no way around it
simon swings the car out onto the boulevard kicking back
see its not just the car its a total image
an identity you have to go for
this isnt some high tech sports car
it doesnt even handle that great
but thats not the idea is it
simon gives harry a big grin
harry returns a knowing chuckle
whatre we talking about here
a big lusty male bonding kind of laugh
well then this is a vital piece of equipment
used properly it can change your life
see you cruise
this aint a ferrari
you check out the scenery let the scenery check you out
you got to take it slow
old cars are like good women
they heat up fast
how do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold
simon is holding court
over tacos he waxes eloquent on his greatest area of expertise
we see harry laughing going along with the guy
pretending to bond
lets face it harry the vette gets em wet
but its not enough
if you want to really close escrow you gotta have an angle
and youve got one
look at me im not that much to look at
i can be honest
but i got em lining up and not just skanks either
so whats your angle
set me up and then dont tell me
simon leans forward conspiratorially
okay just ask yourself
what do women really want
you take these bored housewives married to the same guy for years
stuck in a rut
they need some release
the promise of adventure
a hint of danger
i create that for them
so youre basically lying your ass off the whole time
i couldnt do it
well think of it as playing a role
you have to work on their dreams
get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours
isnt that hard to keep up in the long run
i like change
you know constant turnover
as soon as i close the deal its one of two more times then adios
use em and lose em
the trick is you gotta pick your target
they have to be nice little housewife types
but im telling you you get their pilot lit these babes they can suck start a leaf blower
what about the husbands
if they took care of business id be out of business know what i mean
they are cruising along with harry driving this time
you working on someone right now
i always have a couple on the hook
theres one right now ive got her panting like a dog
unconsciously harrys hands clench the wheel tighter
what does she do
some kinda legal secretary of something
married to some boring jerk
harry takes a corner too fast
the tires squealing
and she could be so hot if she wanted to be
shes like a dying plant that just needs a little water
when simon is looking harry is open and encouraging
they laugh together
then when he looks away harry goes snake eyed
he could kill simon with one punch
hes visualizing his wife getting porked by this guy
but with you she gets to be hot right
her thighs steam
they laugh together
harrys laugh is getting a bit brittle
he speeds up his knuckles white on the wheel
now for the big question have they or havent they
shes pretty good in bed then
yelling suddenly hey slow down youre gonna miss the turn
harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty
he cranks the wheel and hits the emergency brake slewing the car into a smoking bootlegger
it screeches backward sliding right into its parking space perfectly
simon is bugeyed
but he is non plussed for only about two seconds
then hes back to selling
he scrambles out and goes around to harry coughing in the cloud of tire smoke
you and this car were meant for each other
why fight it
sure i have a couple other buyers lined up but i like your style
should we start on the paperwork
let me think about it
hold it a day for me
simon grins and winks
because its you
dana is in the living room watching tv when she sees her mother cross through dressed to go out
dinners in the warmer
tell your father i may be late
where are you going
dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles
on helen checking herself in the hall mirror
she looks at her big dowdy purse
hating it suddenly
she pulls her pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet for a small handbag then charges out
harry is driving
gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his briefcase and hands them to him
heres todays transcripts
theres nothing interesting
nothing from simon
keeping one eye on the road harry riffles through the sheets
he glances at the top of the last couple of sheets
then suddenly slams on the brakes
the car dives to the curb bumping one wheel
harry gets out and charges around to gibs side
gib gets out his expression blank
give me the page
what are you talking about
it skips from page nine to eleven
wheres page ten
aw its gotta be a typo harry hammers his fist against the car window right next to gib
it explodes inward in a shower of glass
he fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket
harry grabs it from him straightening it
as harry begins to read we go into flashback
on simon he is talking into the phone in hushed urgent tones
i need your help
can you meet me tonight
intercut with helen at her office
thats all i can say
just meet on k street under the key bridge
at eight sharp
back to the present
harry checks his watch
its almost eight
he jumps back in the car and activates the gps locator
helens purse blip flashes on the grid map
shes still at my house
the purse is still at the house
harry growls and slams the car into gear roaring out into traffic
horns honk as he cuts off people
he is oblivious
he grabs his rover
this is two
acquire subject at k street and key bridge
vehicle is red and white convertible
you have six minutes
wait a minute
are you out of your mind
you cant pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife
its gross misappropriation of sectors resources its
its a breach of national security
harry drives on ignoring him
gib grabs his shoulder shaking him
you copy harry
this is too far
youre losing it big time
i have to stop you
whatya going to do
this is our butts
so your life is in the toilet
so your wife is banging a used car salesman
sure its humiliating
but be a man here you tell on me i tell on you
im clean as a preachers sheets babe
clean as a what about that time you trashed a six week operation because you were busy getting a blow job
instantly contrite you know about that
harry turns to him
his glare could melt metal
gib gives a fatalistic shrug
take franklin its quicker
harry makes the turn squealing tires
you dont have any pictures though do ya
helen pulls her car under the bridge
she checks her watch
helen notices that her hand is shaking
she looks around and the place seems deserted
she is about to leave when she sees headlights flash briefly in the shadows
a red and white vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up next to her
simon motions for her to get in quickly
longshot on simon and helen in the vette coming out of the parking low under the bridge
we are watching them through a sophisticated telephoto night vision device
agent morton lowers the scope and picks up his rover
he puts the car in gear to follow
subject is southbound on key bridge
a man and a woman in the vehicle
simon makes a show of checking the mirrors
now dont be alarmed
but if im spotter it would be best if they dont see you
you should keep your head down until were out of the city
he pushes her head down onto his lap
she crouches there with her cheek against his thigh
hes cruising along loving it
gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen but harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place
the woman has her head in the guys lap
harry is doing a jaw clenched slow burn
one to condor do you have visual
thru omitted it is a highway heading away from the city
in a long lens shot the vette appears over the brow of a hill
a moment later a helicopter rises up behind them a dramatic reveal
it follows the vette
this is condor
we have the ball repeat
we have a good lock up on i
cut to infrared view of the vette from the helicopters flir system
the greenish image intensified view of the car is like daylight
down past the helicopter to the vette on the highway below as they head out into the country
the headlights of the vette light up a ratty single wide mobile home on the outskirts of a trailer park off the highway
simon and helen get out of the car
my place in the city is too hot right now
so is the penthouse in new york
but this place is secure
he takes her inside
helen feels awkward in the small junky space
a tape deck is playing cool jazz
simon hands her a glass of cheap wine
he clinks her glass with his
to our assignment
what is it you need me to do
helen i want you to be my wife
quickly just for the operation in paris
i need to be married
theyll be looking for a man traveling alone
were going to paris
helen theres a double agent in my outfit
i dont know who
theres no one i can trust
can you get away
just for two days
i dont know
i have to think
he clears a place for her on the bed shoving clothes and magazines out of the way
she sits down and he tops off her glass from the wine bottle
the agents have gathered behind a billboard
harry gib and the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits
they finish fitting battle harnesses then they grab black ski masks
they don them in perfect unison
harry leads off and they quick time from behind the billboard closing in on simons trailer
helen looks up at simon and nods slowly
ill do it
simon shoots over and sits next to her taking her hand
you are incredibly brave
i have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling
ive lived like this for years so im used to it
every day when i get up i think it might be my last
but it makes you appreciate life
and the moment
because that may be all you have
he moves a little closer
casting his spell
to pull this cover story off we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other
the enemy can spot a fake easily
he puts his hand on her knee
she tenses up instantly
you see what i mean
that reaction would give us away in a second
try to relax
its just that
its been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that i relax
there thats better
let yourself slip into the role
he puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly into a kiss
this doesnt seem real to helen
she finds herself not pulling away
he lowers her slowly until they are lying together on the bed
there you go
he slides his hand up her thigh
the fingers stroking in little circles slips under her skirt
and she suddenly explodes pushing on his chest forcing him up off her
he keeps kissing her get off me right now
simon struggles with her
she gets one knee up under him and levers him up
she pushes him to a standing position
she sits up on the bed straightening her skirt
he looks forlorn and pathetic
now hes going to try pleading
if not for me do it for democracy
the back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny shaped charges
the concussion throws simon forward on top of her
five black suited figures swarm in carrying machine pistols and flashlights
lit by the beam of the flashlight he sees simon on top of helen her knees up on either side of his hips
it looks bad
simon and helen sit up
they look like two rabbits in the headlights of a truck
reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly materialized as a nightmarish reality
he is stunned
blinking mouth hanging open
what simon sees five demonic figures backlit by the xenon light from a helicopter
smoke and dust swirling in the rotor wash
the figures lunge toward them grabbing them both
helen struggles fiercely as gib disguised pulls her up
harry yanks simon to his feet
gib comes out first with helen
she struggles like a wildcat frankly surprising the hell out of harry
simon is brought out dazed and compliant
helen whips around kneeing gib right in the balls
gib oophs and doubles over and helen runs for it
harry leaves simon with the other agents and runs after helen
she sprints through the trees harry pounding after her
he grabs her and gets her in a headlock
she bites the hell out of his arm
harry yells and lets her go just as keough runs up and matter of factly clips her on the head with his weapon
standard operating procedure
which is why he cant understand why harry punches him knocking him down
harry supports a sagging helen gesturing sharply to the other agents and going rrrrr rrrr to make his point since he cant talk without her recognizing his voice
they head for the cars
an empty room with a single stool under a light and a large two way mirror
the door opens and helen is escorted in by keough still wearing his jumpsuit
helen has a black hood over her head
keough undoes a pair of handcuffs freeing her then leaves quickly
helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light
she wheels at the sound of the door locking and runs to it
pulls twice on the handle without effect
she crosses to the mirror and peers at her reflection trying to see if anyone is there on the other side
on the other side of the glass is a dark chamber
we see helen perfectly peering in though she sees nothing
harry and gib in silhouette sit at a console
harry speaks into a microphone
on helens side of the mirror we hear harrys voice shifted by a digital processor
it is a cold booming mechanical voice
harsh and inhuman
i said sit down
she does who do you work for
kettleman barnes and mcgrath
im a legal secretary
and what were you going with the international terrorist carlos the jackal
he said he was an american agent
inside the control room we can see harry gib and through the glass helen
their voices sound normal on this side
how long have you been a member of his faction
i dont know anything about a faction
i just met simon
or whatever his name is
a couple of weeks ago
i barely know him
thats not what it looked like when we found you
harry scowls at gib in the dark
helen flushes remembering
how did you meet him
we see helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works having a cappucino and a croissant
about two weeks ago i was at the mall having coffee
simon appears behind her sort of stalking up to her
he approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat next to her
his manner is furtive
he keeps looking around as if for hidden assasins
he hands her a briefcase
speaking very low keep this for me
i cant afford to be taken with it
national security is at stake
ill contact you if a can
oh he seems to suddenly spot something off camera and dashes off the other way
helen walks back to her office building carrying the briefcase
she keeps looking over her shoulder
she has the briefcase on her desk while she works
she keeps glancing at it as she types
finally she hunches over it and starts picking the locks with a paper clip
tight on second lock popping open
on helen as she opens the case
inside the case are the following items a tiny camera some loose tapes some circuit diagrams some transcripts that look like gibberish which must be encrypted some street maps of
beirut rome and berlin and a walther p
helen eyes wide closes the case
helen shrugs finishing up her story
i should have gone to the police i suppose
but you didnt
i dont know
i wanted to see what would happen
what did happen
three days later he called me
he told me to meet him at overlook park
through the trees is a sweeping view across the potomac to georgetown and embassy row
helen is sitting on a park bench when simon shows up sitting beside her
she hands him the briefcase
you saved my life
whats your name
you can call me simon
he touches her hand youre very brave to do this
then notices the locks have been opened you opened it
i just glances inside
close on simon looking right into her eyes
solemn then you know
harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes picturing the whole thing
why did you continue to see him
he needed my help
not because you were attracted to him
you werent attracted to him at all
well maybe a little
is this a common thing for you
so it was your first time
i wasnt cheating
tell me about your husband mrs tasker
what can i say about harry
hes a sales rep for a computer company
hard question for him would you say he was boring then
she sighs nodding fatalistically yeah
i suppose he is
so sex with him isnt exactly making your flag wave anymore
harry cuffs him on the shoulder
signals with a scowl for him to stay out of it
harrys put him through enough shit the last couple of days its time for a couple digs
thats none of your goddamn business
what kind of questions are these
youre in a lot of trouble mrs
tasker so i suggest you cooperate
if we want to know the most intimate details of your life youd better tell us
helen glowers at the mirror
her hands are shaking and she hates it that they can probably see she is afraid
my husband is a good man
but hes not exactly ringing your bell lately right
i mean harry covers the mike and whips around on gib
let me handle this part
do you mind
to helen why did you go to carlos hideout
he wanted me to go with him on a mission to pose as him wife
and you agreed
helen searches herself for the explanation
i dont know
i guess i needed something
what did you need
i needed to feel alive
i wanted to do something
i dont know
it felt good to be needed
to be trusted
to be special
in verbalizing it she just feels smaller more pathetic that she ever did
she hates the unseen voices for making for try to explain her deepest unvoiced needs
theres so much i wanted to do in this life and its like i havent done any of it
and the sands running out of the hourglass
i want to be able to look back and say see
i did that
it was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and i fucking did it
she glares at the mirror and i frankly dont give a shit if you understand this or not
gib looks at harry eyebrows raised
harry is studying his wife like shes some fantastic new species
did you sleep with him
covering the mike shes lying
you didnt have sexual relations with him
acidly look if you ask me everything twice this is going to take a really long time
and i have to get home to my family
youre not going anywhere
helen loses it
it is fury and fear tears and rage all at once let me out of her
answer the question she picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror swinging it with all her might
it bounces off harmlessly
she swings again yelling i didnt sleep with him
and again wham
you hear me you chickenshit bastards wham
she hits the mirror again
the mirror suddenly stars from side to side with huge cracks
shes about to beat her way through it
inside the observation room harry and gib jump back
she could be telling the truth
to helen wait
calm down mrs
there is only one more question
helen drops the stool
she stands there panting
her fury spent she begins to cry
do you still love your husband
i love him
i have always loved him and i will always love him
she wipes at her eyes can i go home please
inside the observation room harry states at her
leaning forward to the mike there is only one solution to your problem mrs
you must work for us
whispering to harry oh shit
whatre you doing
like isnt it obvious
im giving her an assignment
to helen i am offerring you a choice
if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life
if not you will go to federal prison and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone
your like will be destroyed
oh gee thanks
mmmm let me see yes or no
what do you think
of course yes
you will be contacted with the assignment
my husband cant know about this
no one must know
you must appear to live your life normally conveying nothing
the security of this nation depends on it
can you do that
i think so
you will be lying to the man you love
the person who trusts you the most
fearless i can do it
the code name of your contact will be boris
your code name will be excited natasha
on helen not liking her wimpy code name
the unit seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge stopping next to helens red accord
the door slides open and helen gets out helped my black garbed hands
she is wearing her hood which is whisked off by one of the hands
she whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off
she watches it drive off into the night
the van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry
the door opens and simon is pushed out followed by harry who is in his black jumpsuit and wearing a ski mask
gib follows as harry guides simon to the edge of a sheer drop
harry whips off the hood and simon takes in his surroundings
you son of a bitch
did you really think you could elude us forever carlos
you got the wrong guy
my names simon
look just let me go
theres no need to kill me
i havent seen your harry whips off his ski mask
simon has ducked his head and wont look at harry
then it dawns
he looks up brightening hopefully
hey you still interested in that vette at all
you can drop it now carlos
the game is over
your career as an inter national terrorist is too well documented
i sell cars
not even foreign cars
nothing international i swear
im no terrorist
everything i said was a lie
you have to believe me
im actually a complete coward
if i ever even saw a gun id harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the muzzle right in front of simons eyes
dont kill me
im not a spy
im navel lint
i have to lie to women to get laid
and i dont score much
he looks down see look
would a spy pee himself
harry is finally sickened by his grovelling
he pulls simon away from the edge then gestures with his gun
soon as i turn youll shoot me
harry starts back to the truck
simon stays right with him facing him terrified to turn away
like a dog following him
you can have the car for free take off dipshit
gib finally shoves simon back and harry contemptuously cranks three rounds into the ground by his feet forcing him to dance backward
the two agents get into the van and tear off in a cloud of dust
leaving simon alone in the moonlight miles from nowhere
tight on locator screen as a blip moves across the grid of city streets
gib drives while harry watches the screen
we should pick up visual at the next light
the scrambler phone in harrys briefcase rings
he picks it up
intercut with sedan
spencer trilby stands glowering as he talks to harry
harry this report on last nights operation is the thinnest piece of crap ive ever seen from you
im sure you wont mind giving me a little more detail on why all these assets were deployed
but can it wait
im on a critical surveillance right now
harry spots something up ahead
he snaps his fingers and points then whips a pair of gyro stabilized binoculars to his eyes
harrys pov through scope trent on the yamaha with dana on the back rides through the intersection up ahead
dana bops to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as trent zips between cars
gib makes the turn pulling in behind them at a distance
is there anything you want to tell me
not that i can think of
the camera pushes in ominously on spencer trilby
you know we never fire anybody
harry hangs up the phone slowly
were dead right
whered you put the transmitter
in her walkman
its the one thing i knew shed be taking
harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors past trents parked yamaha
we hear music from inside
inside the warehouse we see what it is that dana has been doing when she skips school
a garage band of teenagers mostly older than her are playing loudly
dana has the microphone belting out a punchy cover of the old cream classic sunshine of your love
the guitar parts have been industrial ized and it actually sounds pretty hip
harry watches from the shadows standing behind a pillar not far from the stage
watching his daughter gyrating in the spotlight
his reaction is hard to read
tight on the master circuit breaker as harrys hand throws the switch
the stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops abruptly
before the band members can react they hear the big metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in
dana stares into the glare seeing an ominous silhouette standing there
the shadowy figure walks toward them
come with me
the figure comes straight toward dana
to her horror is turns out to be her dad
her heart stops
oh my gooooood
harry appears through the doors marching dana by the arm
he walks her over to some industrial junk nearby overgrown with weeds and sits her down for a talk
she is sullen still mortified from getting dragged out in front of her friends
there are going to be some changes dana
youre going to start following some rules
and im going to be there to see that you do
youre going to stay in school
do you understand
so i can wind up like you
whats the point
you think harrys going to really rain on her parade
but he doesnt
he becomes very tender
he pushes the hair back from her face
did i tell you about the time we first met
she looks up at him puzzled
you were quite young at the time
all wet and still attached to your mom by a cord
you opened your eyes and looked right at me
and i knew then i would always love you with all my heart
dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness
this is not just some chump that she has to put up with
this is her father
he is a part of her
no matter what happens they are in this thing together
tears start to run down her cheeks
somewhere along the way i got lost honey
i forgot about what was really important
im sorry pump i mean she grabs his in a fierce hug
harry closes his eyes letting the moment purify him
dana regarding this singing she pulls back suddenly wary
grinning you were pretty good
dana sits wedged into the front seat between gib and harry
father and daughter are singing raucously loud with the windows down
ive been waiting so long to be where im going in the sunshine of your looooove they crack up after the long sustain
they are both suffused with a glow of rediscovery
harry pulls the car to the curb in front of danas school
dad how come you know the words
honey that song came out in when i was exactly your age
trent told me he wrote it
the image of a family dinner
helen is avoiding harrys eyes
harry looks over at dana and she gives him a tiny smile
then she rises from her half finished dinner and heads out of the kitchen
where are you off to young lady
pointing toward her room i have a book report
helen watches her go
so last night was pretty exciting huh
then smoothly oh the flat tire
yeah i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there
harry smiles reaching for more chicken
the phone rings
helen controls the urge to run to it
gib at omega sector uses the speech synthesizer to disguise his voice
go to the hotel marquis in one hour
pick up an envelope marked doris at the front desk
and dress sexy
back on helen as she reacts to that
thinking for a second then uh
well okay then
you sound terrible
ill run out right now
just call the prescription in to the pharmacy
sure no problem
harry smirks listening to her lie
the smirk drops as she turns
allison is sick in bed
i have to go over there honey
she walks unhurriedly out of the room
behind her back harry is grinning
the second helen is out of his sight line she runs up the stairs
harry waits a moment then picks up the phone
gib is in a corner of the electronics lab in an area dedicated to digital audio processing
the phone in his briefcase rings
youve reached a new low with this one
i cant believe youre crazy enough to use the room at the marquis
you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary
is jean claude done yet
gib looks over at a sound recording booth nearby
in it a fat french agent jean claude is doing voice recording from a hand written page
we hear jean claude record a line on a tiny dat tape recorder
he speaks with a cosmopolitan french accent
close your eyes and hes charles boyer
do it slowly
a big luxury hotel downtown with an opulent lobby
helen enters looking different than we have ever seen her
she has been commanded to be sexy and she is
her black slinky dress is cut at mid thigh showing some good legs we havent been aware of
shes pulled her hair back and added pearls
now she looks elegant and hot
playing the role
she goes to the front desk and signals the assistant manager with her eyes
he comes over to her
do you have an envelope for doris
the man nods
saying nothing he reaches under the counter and hands her the envelope
she opens it as she walks across the lobby
in contains a room key a small bugging device and a phone number
tight on a pay phone as helen finishes dialing the number
she scans the lobby as the phone rings listen
you are a prostitute named michelle
go to the room
a man will be there
he is a suspected arms dealer
do i have to
he has particular tastes
he likes to watch
you will say his regular girl carla is sick
if he likes you he will tell you what to do
you must plant the bug near the telephone by the bed before you leave
if you do not accomplish your mission the deal is off
helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward the suite
she stops by a mirror and checks her look
decides she is too uptown
she pulls the neckline of her dress down so it shows more shoulder then hitches up the hem
ditches the pearls
puts on some red lipstick
now she doesnt look hot and elegant
she practices a slinky walk getting into the role
suddenly she remembers her wedding ring
she pulls on it
it probably hasnt been off in years
she licks her finger and twists it off
she puts it on her right hand and turns the modest diamond palm side in
out of site
then reading the number off the key she goes to the room and unlocks the door
helen comes in hesitantly
the lights are off
the suite is large and richly furnished with a breathtaking view of the city
it is the room harry was using posing as renquist
a french accented voice comes from the next room
she goes into the bedroom
there is a dark figure sitting in a chair just a silhouette
step into the light
it is a corner room
the drapes on one side are closed shadowing the man but open on the other just enough to let in a slash of moonlight
she steps forward into it
tight close up on the figure
we can just make out that it is harry though helen cannot
tilt down to show his hand out of sight behind the chair arm as he manipulates the pause button on the dat tape deck
she thought you might like me so harry goes sssshhhh
silencing her gently
he silently clicks off the pause button
the dat recorder plays
charles boyer deep and hypnotic speaks from harrys outline
let me do the talking
you are very pretty
you may start by unzipping your dress
she starts to yank the zipper down
do it slowly
helen turns her back to him and draws the zipper down languorously revealing her creamy back
she is not wearing a bra
now slip the dress down
helen is starting to get into the ritual
she lets the dress slip off her shoulders
it slides down her body to the floor
she steps out of it still in high heels
now slide the nylons off one by one
puzzled im not wearing any
he starts the next line immediately
now the panties
the ritual continues as she strips slowly this will be tastefully done
she conceals the bugging device in her hand as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone
helen is still concentrating on her mission
now turn cheri in the moonlight
let your body flow like water
her skin is beautiful in the silvery light
now dance for me
helen has no idea what to do but she improvises quite well
the scrutiny of the shadowed man who is fully clothed and her raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic combination
let your hands be a lovers hands on your own skin as you move
yes thats it
tight on harrys eyes as he studies her
his game meant to give her a dangerous fantasy is actually turning him on mightily
he is amazed to see her playing the role getting into it
this is not the helen is thought he knew for sixteen years
now lie on the bed and close your eyes
harry rises and goes to her bringing the tape deck
keep them closed
do not open them
he sits on the bed next to her but without touching her
he strokes her hair lovingly
then runs his fingertips over her eyes down her cheeks
to her it feels delicate and delicious
part of her is enjoying this a lot
but helen is torn between wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so far is enough to cause her to abort her mission
i thought you only liked to watch
harry goes ssshhh
its all he can do
he bends over her and brings his lips slowly down to her
he touches them to hers so slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her
then he takes her in a passionate kiss
and she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and smashes it over his head
harry flies off onto the floor groaning and semiconscious
helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes starting to dress rapidly
she still doesnt recognize harry who is face down
he groans and starts to rise
she kicks him in the ribs and finishes putting her dress on
she sticks the bug under the night table and grabs her shoes
mission accomplished motherfuckers
harry grabs her ankle
she raises one shoe to kosh him again and sees who it is
she cant even form the question
the door lock is shattered by tremendous force and three men burst into the room
we may recognize them as workers from junos shop
they are wielding pistols and are clearly part of maliks terrorist brigade
harry is still groggy and he doesnt want to start anything with helen there and risk her getting shot
he acquiesces as they pull him to his feet
hes got nothing to do with this
its me you want right
to lead terrorist let the hooker go
shes not important
harry be quiet
let me handle this
shutup both of you
during this exchange the thugs have handcuffed harrys hands behind his back
the leader gestures to one of the men to bring helen along
helen and harry are dragged roughly out of the room with pistol muzzles stuck in their ribs
the door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle harry and helen down the fire escape stairs
listen you dont need him hes nothing
hes a sales rep for a computer company really the thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up
that was unnecessary
a stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush harry and helen through the basement labyrinth
what were you doing there
you wouldnt believe me
a pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind helens ear
talk again i kill you
they are hustled across a loading dock to a rental van waiting with the door open
a fourth terrorist slides the van door shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel
the van takes off
the rental van pulls up to a g jet warming up outside a private hanger
the van doors open and the hostages are brought out
harry sees a long black limo pulling up behind the van
the driver an enormous man names akbar hurries to open the passenger door
a slender pair of ankles emerge followed by the rest of juno skinner looking devastatingly beautiful but now quite sinister
to helen it is like a living james bond film with the jet the limo the terrorists and now an exotic femme fatale dressed to kill approaching them
with a wry smile hello harry
i wish i could say its a pleasure to see you again
you know her
juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the prisoners toward the plane
whos your little friend
im helen tasker
harrys my husband
and you are
to harry so now its tasker
they enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane
helen has never seen anything like this
look harrys not part of this
hes just a sales rep
no my dear he is a federal agent
he killed two of my colleagues the other night
no you dont understand weve been married for years look juno this is just some whacko hooker i met in the bar
akbar and the other terrorists push helen and harry into seats and strap them in
harry whats the matter with you
tell them the truth
were married we have a daughter looking at helen contemptuously i dont know what this crazy bitch is on
you should just cut her loose so we can get down to business
then where did i get this
helen grabs the locket dangling on a chain around her neck and opens it to show juno
the picture in the locket harry and helen together smiling
harry roles his eyes
a flight hostess walks up carrying a tray
juno smiles graciously at helen
something before take off
the hostess whips a pneumatic injector off the tray and zaps helen in the shoulder
you biii she slumps
juno looks at harry
she was telling the truth wasnt she harry
she really doesnt know
juno nods and the hostess zaps harry
he slides into unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to scream
the g lifts into the night sky turning south
a small freighter is tied up to a half crumbling pier
next to the pier is a dilapidated corrugated metal warehouse building two stories high
there are floodlights on the dock but beyond is black night with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms
it is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island in the caribbean
there is a lot of activity
three u rent trucks are parked by the warehouse as well as some other vehicles
about thirty men clearly crimson jihad terrorists are busy at various activities
many of them carry ak assault rifles
malik is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp covered object about feet high from the ship
a rusting gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse
malik looks up as an aerospatiale helicopter thunders toward them over the black caribbean water
the helicopter lands and juno steps down from the front door
the sliding door is opened and akbar and the others pull a groggy harry and helen out of the aircraft
they are covered by hoods
malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off
harry takes in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of malik
lethal energy flows between them
who is this woman
seeing the possibilities his wife
malik leads the entourage into the warehouse where brilliant floodlights illuminate three huge stone figures lined up in the middle of the space
the tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded revealing a fourth statue
the figures are cracked and obscured by centuries but they are unmistakably warriors mounted on horseback
the legs and arms are missing on some but the massive heads and necks remain
incredible arent they
warrior figures from the persian empire of darius the first around bc
i call them the four horsemen
she approaches the nearest figure caressing its flank
a man with a jackhammer steps up to her
theyre absolutely priceless
she shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer
he blasts right into the body of one of the horseman destroying it
stone fragments fall away revealing a cavity cut with great precision inside the figure
inside is a bright metal container
four terrorists pull it out and set it on the ground
it is six feet long and coffin like
malik steps up to it his eyes glistening
a hush has fallen over the group
the latches are released and the lid lifted
inside is machined metal object roughly conical about five feet long
malik signals to harry to step closer and look
do you know what this is
can you give me a clue
it could be a water heater for all i know
malik grabs helen jerking her roughly forward
he whips out a knife and inserts the point under helens jaw forcing her head back and drawing blood
do you know why you have been brought here
so that this man can verify to the world that crimson jihad is now a nuclear power
how can harry do that
hes a salesman for chrissakes
if we were wrong about him
then the last thing you see will be your blood spraying in his face
harry steps forward his face grim
this is a soviet mirv six from an ss n launch vehicle
the warhead contains
kilos of enriched uranium with a plutonium trigger
the nominal yield is kilotons
in arabic subtitled release her and ill cooperate
malik lowers the knife from her jaw
he turns away from her like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to remove the other weapons
jackhammers tear into the stone figures
helen is just staring at harry her mouth open
he turns to her not knowing what to say
he shrugs sheepishly
what can i say
im a spy
she just looks at him for a long time
she moves closer staring and staring letting it sink in
then she hauls off and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him down
you lying son of a bitch
terrorists grabs her and restrain her
she starts to cry
im sorry honey
dont call me honey
you dont ever get to call me honey again
juno looks at them both and laughs
she offers helen a tissue
here you go dear
nearby akbar is going through the contents of helens handbag and harrys wallet
he rips open the bottom stitching and pulls out the geo positioning transmitter
look at this
malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor
helen looks at the crushed transmitter
she stares at harry with dawning realization
you bugged me
juno cracks up at this
the jet has become a mobile tactical command center with gib faisil and several other agents working out of portable equipment cases
faisil looks up from a computer screen suddenly
weve lost the signal
gib who has been pacing the aisile whirls to the screen
son of a bitch
its an island in the keys out past marathon
gib goes up to the cockpit
they are on approach and the lights of miami fill the front window
miami tca we are on final
call our dea contact tell him i want those choppers flight ready the second we land
tight on black and white viewfinder image of the terrorists handycam
harry is speaking directly into the camera finishing up his message
and i can verify that they have the arming box and all equipment necessary to detonate the four warheads
this is absolutely the real thing gentlemen
the camera swings off harry to malik standing before the rest of the jihad warriors who are assembled behind the four bombs
you have killed our women and children bombed our cities from afar like cowards and dare to call us terrorists over the image of malik a low battery warning begins
cut to scene as malik speaks into the camera which is head by one of his men
the cameraman is sweating wondering if he should interrupt
he gulps nervously as malik drones on
but now the oppressed have been given a mighty sword to strike back at their enemies
unless the us pulls all military forces out of the persian gulf area immediately and forever crimson jihad will rain fire on one major us city each week until these
demands are met
back to viewfinder image
battery warning flashing faster
first one weapon will be detonated on this uninhabited island as a demonstration of crimson jihads power and our willingness to be humanitarian
however if there demands are not in a burst of static the image goes black
the cameraman nervously lowers the camera ashen faced
maliks eyes are black with murder
get another one you moron
a filthy crumbling cinderblock building near the warehouse
a few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then and no glass in the windows
harry and helen are brought in by two terrorist guards
juno follows then into the bleak room
guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs
a man enters the room carrying a small suitcase
he has skull like features
he opens the suitcase and harry has a good view of the contents medical instruments needle probes drills dremel tools with saw blades
this is samir
see if you can guess his specialty
scared whats going on harry
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions
see were not even sure which agency harry works for
now samir is absolutely first class but on the other hand we have harry here who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for years
so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist
holding up a syringe this will help
samir injects harry in the arm with the syringe
you know you should swab that with alcohol
i might get an infection
ill return when this has taken effect
then well talk
im looking forward to it
why are you helping these raving psychotics
because theyre very well funded raving psychotics and im getting a lot of money
she kneels down in front of harry stroking his leg
you think i care about their cause
not at all
see america is on top now
but so was rome once
all civilizations crumble
one nation succeeding over another
what does it mean in the long run
the only important thing is to live well
living well takes money
youre damaged goods lady
harrys words are beginning to be slightly slurred
the drugs are taking effect
indicating helen did you tell her about us harry
there is no us you psychotic bitch
say that now
juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately
she breaks looking at helen to savor the effect
helen is trembling with rage
thanks for everything harry
it was good while it lasted
juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand grenade off his belt
then she goes to helen and places it between her knees
she pushes helens knees together to hold the spoon against the grenade then pulls the pin
now just keep your knees together and youll be fine
something you obviously have a hard time doing
hold that thought
harry looks dopily at helen
there was nothing
helen doesnt believe him and why should she
she looks up from staring at the grenade to see that harrys head has slumped forward
what did he give you
groggy sodium amytal maybe some other truth agent
it makes you tell the truth
is it working yet
ask me a question i would normally lie to
are we going to die
id say its working
theyll either torture us to death shoot us in the head or leave us until the bomb goes off
i get it
how long have you been a spy harry
have you had to
have sex with other women in the line of duty
i dont take those assignments
what about juno
shes really a fox isnt she
did you pork her harry
pause but i wanted to
crying are you a total lying scumsucking pig harry
looks that way
on malik as he pokes through harry and helens stuff on the table
he picks up helens wallet and opens it
ecu wallet a picture of harry helen and dana
malik stares at it a moment
then motions to one of his men
samir lifts harrys head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced
is there anything you would like to tell me before we start
im going to kill you pretty soon
calmly preparing his instruments i see
well i thought id break your neck then use you as a human shield then kill the guard with that knife there on your table and take his gun
samir approaches harry with a long steel needle probe
humoring harry and what makes you think you can do all that
because i picked the lock on these handcuffs
he holds them up to show samir
then he explodes out of the chair breaks the torturers neck spins him between himself and the guard who then hesitates to fire giving harry the split second he needs
to grab the knife from the table and throw it into the guards eye killing him instantly
helen is flat blown away
it only took a few seconds for harry to reverse the situation
he picks up the guards mm pistol and staggers over to her
he kneels down in front of her
gently he slips his hands between her thighs getting a grip on the grenade then sliding his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely
he stops moving suddenly
she realizes with a sudden jolt of terror that he has frozen
what is it
staring transfixed god you have great legs
snap out of it
she sees how shitfaced he is
he holds the grenade up gripped safely so the spoon cant fly off
go it baby
harry and helen emerge from the building creeping through the shadows
she stops him for a second
gets very close to him whispering crouched in the shadows
tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again
do you still love me
as much as you used to
she deflates much more
she looks into his eyes and knows he is telling the truth
grinning it wore off
at that moment they hear yelling from the cinder block building
they found the bodies
come on harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp
a light hits them
two terrorists running around the corner open fire with ak s just as harry and helen reach a cluster of palm trees
the trunks explode with bullet hits as they run through the darkness
as the two terrorists move through the trees harry lunges from the shadows and grabs one from behind
he wrests his rifle away and swings it at the other knocking his ak down
the first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him but harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner
then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two hand neck breaker snap
two more run around the corner of a building
harry stomps his foot down on one of the aks which is lying across a log
it flips into the air and he catches it in firing position
and takes them out with two well aimed bursts
helen comes out of the shadows staring at harry in amazement
his shirt is ripped he is scratched and bleeding holding an assault rifle expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal
i married rambo
he grabs her and kisses her passionately
thru omitted looking down from a catwalk on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace
a rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons including machine guns and several hand launched stinger missiles
one of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor
malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it
a guard f
on the catwalk watches intently from the railing
so intently that he doesnt head harry sneak up on him
harry catches the guards mac machine pistol before it can hit the floor
he and helen crouch behind a steel pillar watching the proceedings below
helen keeps glancing at the dead guard killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband
it is all surreal
below malik is shouting in his native language
he pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a metal arming key
then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warheads arming computer
harry is listening intently translating for helen
in ninety minutes a pillar of holy fire will rise at this place as a sign to out enemies
malik theatrically turns the arming key it is done
malik jumps out of the pit
he signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit covering the bomb
he begins ranting again
now no man can stop us
we are set on our course
no force can stop us
as libbing were cool were badass blah blah
malik raises his fist and chants some crimson jihad slogans
the terrorists echo and chant and then cheer firing their guns in the air
harry pulls helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building
malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time
they are loading warheads two and three onto trucks one per truck and the last number four is being wheeled out on a cart to the aerospatiale outside
if were on an island why are they using trucks
we must be in the florida keys
the overseas highway connects the islands to the mainland
so theres no border no customs
they can just drive anywhere they want
theres nothing to stop them
what are you going to do
shrugs like what do you think
go down there and kill everybody i guess
he hands her the mac
she holds it clumsily
if you have to use this use it
she nods gamely and harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below
on harry reaching the floor
he slips behind some packing crates
then swings into action he hurls the grenade as hard as he can down to the other end of the building
he uses the distraction to move forward
but it goes wrong almost right away
a terrorist comes around a corner behind him shouts harry dives for cover as the guy fires but he trips on a pipe and goes sprawling losing the ak which
slides under some equipment and seven terrorists run toward him with guns raised
to helen helen fires a burst at the terrorists actually hitting one
but the recoil knocks her back into a metal column and the gun it falls to the metal steps and hits going off
b b blam
the burst kills two more terrorists and the mac cartwheels and hits further down
another terrorist is splattered
it spins and hits another step another random burst she has inadvertently saved her husband
harry looks up from behind cover to see all seven dead
now its his turn to be amazed
he signals to her to run
get off the exposed catwalk
she makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her
a terrorist with a knife runs at the unarmed harry
harry snatches up a jack hammer and brat tat tat drives it into the guys chest
then he grabs an ak from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire
malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going
the other terrorists return fire at harry who sprints from cover to cover reaching a side door where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst but terrorists
behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he dives through the door landing outside
he takes cover behind an aircraft refueling truck
not a good place
he is pinned down by automatic weapons fire
he looks around for helen who is yards away
she is unarmed and unable to help
harry cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the nozzle of the hose
he opens the flow and a stream of jet fuel blasts out of the nozzle and harry fires his ak right across the nozzle the muzzle blast ignites the av
gas and he has a flame thrower with a foot reach
harry lit demonically by the inferno paints the whole area setting vehicles afire and scattering the terrorists
through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand malik a law rocket
malik snaps it to his shoulder preparing to fire
harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as malik fires
the rocket shoots toward the truck and harry leaps toward the dark water as kabooom
behind him the gas truck explodes in a huge fireball
an instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the surface above him
harry kicks hard trying to swim beyond the inferno above him so he can surface
close on helen watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck
oh my god
a pistol enters frame
its muzzle taps the back of her head
she gasps and turns to see juno holding the weapon expertly
my condolences to the window
juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet
helen slaps juno hard
juno has a slash across her cheek
blood trickles down
she grabs helens hand and viciously turns it seeing the wedding ring turned inward the diamond on the palm side
her face darkens with fury and she points the gun at helens face preparing to kill her
and maliks hand grabs her wrist stopping her
we may need a hostage
juno grabs her and twists her around pushing her toward the limo nearby
lets go suzy homemaker
harry is still swimming
he reaches the edge of the fire and surfaces gasping for breath
treading water he scans the dock
amid the fire and smoke he sees juno walking helen at gun point toward a limo
tracking with juno approaching the car
malik passes jumping into the aerospatiale with his few remaining men
the fourth bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed
the copter pulls pitch fanning the flames of the inferno below as it arcs away
akbar the pound terrorist chauffeur opens the door and juno gets into the limo with helen
akbar scrunches into the front seat and starts the car
there is just enough light to see some geography
the island is very tiny
running right over it and to the horizon in both directions is the overseas highway
the terrorists trucks rumble up an on ramp past a sign that says miami
the limo is the last member of the convoy
the aerospatiale passes overhead hugging the deck headed for miami at knots
it looks like the aftermath of a battle
burning wreckage black smoke bodies
not a living soul around
the smoke swirls as two big bell helicopters settle on the middle of the dock
gib jumps out of the nearest with an ar scanning the wreckage
several of his men and a couple of dea agents spread out
gib breaks into a grin as he sees harry materializing out of the swirling smoke
dripping wet clothes ripped and bloody
i thought this look like your work
ill brief you in the air
gib and harry are working out of brief case mobile com units
several omega agents with headsets are reading maps giving commands coordinating the evacuation mobilizing their own forces
the energy is controlled but very high everybody talking at once
this is the day they all have trained for
it is impressive to watch
you tell the son of bitch this is bright boy alert
repeat a bright boy alert
and i need a patch of the white house asap
thats right overlapping the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius
anybody that cant make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on immediately gib whips around to harry lowering his headset mike
i can get marine corps harriers here in about minutes
theyre on maneuvers out of boca chica
checking his watch get em
ill brief them on the way in
traffic on the two causeways is almost non existent this early in the morning
the three rental trucks followed by the limo about a mile back are almost the only vehicles
juno has a mm pistol aimed at helen
she opens the sunroof letting in the morning air and light
then pours herself a scotch from the bar
eyes like steel fuck you
harry and gib are both talking a mile a minute coordinating the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area
well get the highway patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers
just the basics
get away from windows dont look at it
yeah here they come
gib looks out the window in time to see three hunch winged p
harrier jets pass them at knots
to the pilots roger mike three five you are cleared to engage
be advised your targets have stingers and light machine guns
the pilot like all jet pilots seems icy calm
copy that bright boy command
to his wingman tally ho
the terrorists see the harriers approaching on a low attack run and scramble to get out their stingers
the harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the trucks below
the mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of the causeway into plumes of spray
one of the bomb trucks is hit
it explodes and flies off the bridge into the water
the terrorists on one of the other trucks fire a stinger missile
it arrows up blowing one wing off the lead harrier
the pilot ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes
harry sees the battle far ahead
the exploding jet
to the pilots recommend you use your mavericks to take out the bridge
they wont set off those nukes will they
negative mike three five
thats a negative
low to gib probably not
the two remaining harriers make an attack run launching four maverick missiles at the bridge
the missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and k boooom
a whole section of the concrete span collapses into the water
the first truck is consumed in the blast
the last truck slides to the edge of the gap and stops
juno is trying to see whats going on ahead
all they can see is smoke and explosions
akbar is speaking heatedly in arabic into a walky talky and getting no answer
helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward grabbing the gun
juno fires wildly as they struggle for control of the weapon
the sound is deafening in the tiny space
the second shot catches akbar behind the ear and he slumps forward
his foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal and the car surges faster
the third harrier fires its
rockets and blows the remaining truck into tinfoil
two bombs down
the columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles ahead of the copter
good shooting mike three five
i need you to stay on station
to the copter pilot okay
you see that limo
the limo tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one guardrail to the other throwing sheets of sparks where it hits
in is funneling along the causeway unslowed like an out of control train
inside helen knocks junos hands against the edge of the open sunroof and the pistol goes flying out
helen is raging grabbing junos head and pounding it against anything hard she can find inside the car
suddenly she stops looking out the front window
juno turns too off her look to see angle through the windshield
the causeway is blown away about a quarter mile ahead
juno climbs through the window into the front seat tugging on the dead driver
the heavyset akbar is like a bag of cement
helen look up through the sunroof and sees the bell copter descending rapidly
harry is climbing out onto the skids
he hooks on arm and leg over the skid and hangs down as low as he can
helen stands up in the opening and waves her arms
gib is yelling at the dea pilot whos not thrilled with this idea
get lower goddamnit
harry strains downward with one hand
helen reaches up toward him
the car screeches along the guard rail slamming against it throwing her from side to side in the sunroof
their fingers touch then separate
she looks the limo is almost on the precipice
inside the car juno is desperately pulling on the inert driver
he slumps over on her pinning her
she looks over the dash as the shattered edge of the causeway rushes toward them harrys hand grabs helens
he pulls her out of the car just as the limo clears the edge
she is jerked through the sunroof screaming
the car falls away arcing gracefully to the ocean below
it hits with an enormous explosion of water
harry pulls helen up onto the skid with him getting her stable
she is gasping holding on for dear life
she looks down at the ocean the burning wreckage on the bridge the whole unbelievable panorama
then she looks at harry and grins
and so is he
and not only that this is the biggest rush of her life
harry grins back
surprised and pleased that she is more of a soul mate than he ever knew
angle on a harrier landing in full hover on the causeway
the shriek of the jet engine is enormous
it bounces down onto its wheels like a big inscect
the other remaining harrier is already down behind it
tracking past burning wreckage to harrys bell just settling on the highway
the other dea bell is landing with the harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling
harry jumps out of the open door followed by helen and gib
harry looks at his watch
any minute now
with a megaphone to everybody its show time
dont look at the flash
do not look at the flash
to helen were safe here
helen and harry move away from the agents
they are safe and together
they look at each other and there is nothing to say
harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and slips it back onto its rightful finger
he leans forward to kiss her
she reaches for him
their lips meet
and they are locked together in that position when the sky lights up behind them
talk about fireworks
harry covers her eyes and they stay in the kiss
they are in no danger but the effect is stunning
the classic mushroom cloud appears at the horizon
helen watches awed the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age
that was some kiss
the two young harrier pilots stand nearby watching the mushroom disperse
gib is with the other omega agents his finger pressed in his ear listening to his headset
he waves to harry to come to him
harry detaches from helen and walks over to him
helen watches him go
back to work
she glances over at the two harrier pilots
to the pilots thats my husband
harry goes into the huddle with gib and the others
maliks copter landed twenty minutes ago in miami
hes on the top of a high rise downtown
swats on the scene and i got the cops sealing off the area
he renezvousd there with about a dozen more faction members
theyre barricaded on the twentieth floor
he gets very serious harry they have a hostage
they must have grabbed her during the night
we didnt know
sorry harry i but harry is already moving
he sprints toward the nearest harrier witch is idling nearby
gib runs after him
well get her out
we have a man inside already
here we go
harry walks up to the young pilot
i need to borrow this thing for a few minutes
he pushes past the pilot before the guy can react
force comm cleared you to give us total cooperation right
thats coming right from the president captain
youre going to have to sign for the aircraft
ill sign for it
you got a pen
one of the agents pulls out a pen here hell sign for it
harry is in the cockpit by now
gib climbs up
id like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these
if i break it they can take it out of my pay
harry doesnt have a g suit or a helmet of anything
he just has his walky on his belt
inside the cramped cockpit harry looks around for the lever which vectors the thrust
finds it and sets it to degrees vertical
he bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle up to full
to pilot itll be fine
hes got hundreds of hours in harriers
joint ops cross training and all that
harry can fly anything
the big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble bee
hes a little rusty
its like riding a bicycle
you never forget
id seek shelter
it drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way
at about six feet above the ground it slides sideways clips the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar
it lifts unsteadily straight into the sky
it turns around
hes got it
harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust nozzles turn accelerating the plane forward
gib is standing watching harry go
he never believes this guy
harrys voice comes over the walky
tell helen whats going on
tell her i love her
and ask the pilot where the button for the mm cannon is never mind
i found it
the plane disappears toward miami
an aerial shot circling the building
it is an unfinished building in the high rise district
the aerospatiale sits on the roof its rotor turning slowly
the street below is jammed with cars
honking horns echo up the glass canyons
angle at streetlevel as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to clear the street around the building setting up a perimeter two blocks away
inside the high rise the terrorists have barricaded themselves on the twentieth floor
there are terrorists all with automatic weapons
occasionally one of them will fire a burst down a stairwell with an ak
miami dade swat team members are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance
malik is sequestered with the bomb
it sits on the floor still in its shipping case
dana stands nearby looking scares
she is not ties up
where can she go
she watches malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key
he has a tv set up on some crates and we see that his video tapes demands are running on cnn
harrys face fills the screen verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat
he is identified at the bottom of the screen as harry tasker atomic energy commission
dana stares at her fathers face on the national news
its like a bad dream
she has been crying but she is fairly composed now
i have to go to the bathroom
the terrorists ignore her
a terrified action news reporter and his cameraman under guard by two terrorists are hastily setting up to shoot malik
tape is rolling
this is a communique from crimson jihad
you have heard from your own expert
you have seen the holy fire with your own eyes
do not force us to destroy this city
and do not try to use force against us
i can trigger this bomb instantly
all i have to do is turn that key
he points fiercely at the bomb and five million of your people will die
the reporter glances down nervously
pointing like the guys blind that key right there
malik looks down
the key is gone
to his men someone has stolen the key
he turns looking around wildly
malik then sees dana running for the stairwell to the roof
he pulls a pistol and shoots at her but hits the wall as she bangs through the door
he runs after her
on the roof malik bursts through the stairwell door
his two men have followed him
malik stops suddenly when he sees dana standing at the edge of the roof
she is holding the arming key by its chain
dangling it over the edge
he signals to his men not to fire
terrified but thinking you shoot me thisll fall
malik advances slowly his eyes glistening ferally
she backs up a step with each of his moving along the edge of the roof
malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest
dont come any closer
ill drop it
i swear to god
if you drop it i will have no reason not to kill you
he advances calling her bluff
she backs away from him along the edge
come on child
give me the key
smiling dont you want to live
i give you my word
no way you whacko
she reaches the corner of the building
her back touches something
it is the boom of a small crane used for lifting building supplies
careful to keep the key dangling over open space dana climbs up on the lattice work boom and moves out beyond the edge of the building never taking her eyes
she is hyperventilating terrified but thinking clearly
malik steps up on the crane crawling out after her
he knows she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun
it is a game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom
dana puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better
it is windy and the boom is swinging
the crimson jihad warriors hear a thunderous shrieking roar and look toward the window
it fills the windows completely hovering only a few feet outside
the terrorists raise their ak s to fire just as harry hits the mm nose cannon
glass explodes into glittering mist and terrorists explodes into bloody spray as harry pivots the plane and the cannon sweeps the floor clear from side to side
the crimson jihad is vaporized
malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing but from where he is he cant see whats going on
he focuses on the key
he must have that key
maliks two remaining men run to the helicopter gesticulating to the pilot to get ready to take off
the pilot revs the turbine and the rotor whirls faster
the two men jump in picking up m machine guns
malik is still advancing out the crane boom
dana slips as she backs up toppling off the boom
she is hanging now by her hands over a story drop
malik is almost to her
he needs a hand free to grab her
he sets his gun down on the girder
he grabs for her wrist
angle looking down
malik dana the street far below
with an unbelievable roar the harrier sweeps in beneath dana harry has the canopy up
malik sees harry ten feet below
his eyes narrow with an all consuming rage
he glances at the pistol on the beam
back at the girl the key in her teeth so close
harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under dana
shouting let go baby
ive got you
daddys got you
malik lunges for her wrist
she screams and lets go dana drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet harry grabs her with his left hand right hand still on the stick he holds
her until she can get a grip
she is lying across the nose of the plane
harry starts to bank away and malik shrieks in rage
he grabs his mm pistol and leaps off the crane onto the back of the plane
he starts crawling toward the cockpit
dana screams and harry looks back but just then the aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of them the door gunner opens fire
harry banks hard taking the hits under the wing
he pivots and slides sideways around the building playing tag with the copter
he cant do anything radical enough to dislodge malik without tossing off his own daughter
the helicopter appears around the corner guns blazing in the doors
harry pivots the plane and fires the nose cannon
the helicopter is riddled
it tilts and plummets auto rotating out of control
as the copter hits the ground and explodes
fortunately the police had created a cleared perimeter
the harrier dips and slews half out of control
malik is taking aim with the pistol right at harrys head
harry grabs his daughter with his left hand holding her with all his strength and he jinks the stick hard just as malik opens fire but the plane tilts wildly
and malik topples screaming he slides along the wing and falls over the leading edge only to catch himself on the only available hand hold the last sidewinder missile
harry and malik lock eyes for one long second
then harry hits the firing stud
the sidewinder drops away and ignites
carrying malik out over miami beach
it explodes a mile out to sea
harry pulls dana into the cockpit settling her on his lap
dont touch the stick baby
she stares at her father in amazement
he banks away from the building accelerating the jet
he grins at her
raises one eyebrow
woggles the planes wings
dinner at home and everybodys there
we come in on the end of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical
you should have seen your father standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce
he looked like such a dope
i told the guy snorts its too funny i told the guy this isnt even my order
dana is laughing too a part of it
they are happy
they are a family
dana gets up her meal half eaten as usual
she heads for the front door
i seem to remember something about a history project thats due tomorrow
you just think you know everything dont you
dana trudges off to her room to do her homework
the phone rings
boris and doris
calmly signalling harry with her eyes go ahead
it is a black tie affair
camera swoops over the guests sipping champagne and dancing
it is an embassy crowd very international
harry and helen work their way through the crowd
he is in tux hair slicked back looking rakish
she is elegant in a low cut gown and diamond choker
harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and hands her one
very close on gib hunches in a dark van someplace nearby
he speaks into his headset mike
so whats the scoop team
you see your contact yet
helen and harry smile and nod as if they know people
speaking very low helen answer gib via sub vocal transceiver
but well find him
he whirls her across the floor and the camera pulls back and up as they dance
