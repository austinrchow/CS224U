assassins early draft by larry andy wachowski written by larry and andy wachowski august we know that we are looking at something because its polished surface shimmers with light
pulling back other squares are revealed the black and white tiles of a chess board
the board rises and spins slipping beneath us we find ourselves moving across the board moving through a chess game
the pieces are everywhere checking and covering other pieces
it has reached that critical moment when pieces are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies unravel towards a final outcome
standing above the pieces around him we see the black king
we move closer towards his face closer to his chiseled ebony features closer until we are staring into his cold black eyes
the red setting sun is reflected in the black lens
two men are tromping through the calf deep mud of an end less marsh
it is fall the first frost not far away and the foliage is brown and bare
with the red orange ball of fire melting into the horizon the two men at first appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the mire
the man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man
he is very well dressed in a dark suit
caliber gun fitted with a long silencer dangles from his hand
his name is robert rath
the other man is willie ketcham
he is also wearing a very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the brambles and mud
as he lifts his foot his gucci shoe is sucked off by the mud
he balances on one leg holding his silk socked foot in the air
he looks at the shoe already filling with mud
he looks at rath
how much farther
just a little ways
up to those trees
about a half mile further into the thickening marsh there is a small cluster of trees
oh fuck it
he pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud
it feels good
he hurls the sock
lifting his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that
he grabs for the other sock struggling to get it off laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud
rath waits a faint smile
he manages to get the sock off and then stands digging both feet into the dark wet earth
hey this feels kinda good
they move on ketcham almost playing sinking his feet deep pulling them out to make a splurching sucking noise
hey do you mind if i talk a little
i feel like i dont know talking i guess
funny ive never been a talker
my wife was always getting on me about that
say what you feel tell me whats bothering you you ve got to talk to me
i never would though
i dont know
part of me wanted to but part of me always said whats she going to be able to do
i dont know
maybe i didnt trust her
he picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a snowball
i loved her but you know what
i cheated on her
all the time
i dont even know why
it wasnt the sex margaret was great in bed
i think if i wasnt married i wouldnt have even looked at some of those women
i knew she couldnt trust me so how could i trust her
if she was here right now id think that i would tell her that i was sorry
course if she were here right now maybe i wouldnt feel like talking
he throws the mud ball at the grove of trees but they are too far
i think ive heard of you
youre pretty famous arent you
i hope not
i know this may seem like a strange question but can i ask you how much the contract was for not to insult you or anything i know youre a
professional but just for me i was just wondering
its a common question
i guess we still need to see that price tag
like art right
you hang some painting that looks like baby puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle
one hundred thousand
is that a lot
i have been thinking about this for a long while
i knew this day was coming
i knew someday someone would make the call on me
i never thought about anyone that i had whacked
what do you call it anyway
when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them
everyone who plays the game knows the rules
thats exactly what i told myself
ketcham laughs again
he is getting kind of giggly like hes high
i always wondered what id be thinking at this exact moment
i imagined that i would be thinking about the fucker who contracted this trying to figure out who it was
something occurs to him and he looks back at rath
thats how it works
thats what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret or work or that id be having these deep profound and depressing thoughts but im not
im trying to think really profound thoughts but i cant
it seems very funny to me
what are you thinking about
im thinking about moonpies
aint that funny
i havent had a moonpie since i was ten years old
right now im thinking how much id love one
and an r
hes laughing and rath laughs with him
ketcham suddenly stops laughing
they are nearly to the cluster of trees
can i ask you something
what do other guys do
he looks at the trees his voice dying in the wind
everyone handles it differently
some are ready some are not
do they get down on their knees begging and crying
when i thought about this that was always there in the back of my head that image of me on my knees crying
it wouldnt go away and it would really upset me
it was something that i could never get away from
but now i feel its okay
i feel good
can i ask you a question
why didnt you fade
you mean quit
i used to think about it
i had margaret
she wanted kids
i thought about moving somewhere far away like europe
i could see all of that the first part the getting away but i couldnt see that next part
so id stop thinking about it and go back to work
ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch trees
i always pictured that i would end in some land fill under someone elses garbage
i kept picturing those plastic diapers filled with some babys green shit covering me
but this is nice
he looks at the sun bloody red seeping into the black horizon
look at that
i havent watched the sun set in a million years
do you mind
ketcham stares at the last of the light
with his face hidden from rath he begins to cry
rath watches ketcham staring at the setting sun
rath looks down at the gun limply held in his hand
when the sun is gone a red glow at the bottom of a dark ening sky we hear the gun silenced once then the body falling into the mud
after a beat we hear two more ketcham is lying face down already sinking into the mud a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze left by
the dying sun
rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly stand ing alone in the middle of nowhere
the room is dark and still
a man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light
snow is falling heavy white flakes glittering in the citys electric night
the man finishes his bourbon ice clinking in the empty glass
he is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window
in the dim light we recognize the man as rath
outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for christmas
he watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below
he is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall when there is a knock at the door
crossing the room he opens the door
backlit by the bright hallway light is a woman
she has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight
did you call yes
please come in
her high heels tap against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat
goodness its so dark
she reaches for the wall switch but he stops her
i prefer it like this
how can a beautiful man like you be shy
i prefer it thats all
she moves closer to him the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat
its okay honey
we can do it anyway you want
rath is obviously uncomfortable
would you like a drink
id love one
whatever youre having
they move into the room from a distance as featureless as two shadows
she stands at the windows watching the snow bubble of a city night
he hands her the drink
her smile is bright and perfect
good will towards men
their glasses clink as he drains half his drink
if she drinks at all we can not tell
why are you working today
holidays are our busiest days
no one likes to be alone on holidays
i know i dont
she touches his face the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine
youre very good at this arent you
i think youre supposed to answer that question
her hand slides down his chest but before it goes any farther rath turns away returning to the bar
i know what you expect but i dont want
he pours himself another drink
thats okay hon i always expect the unexpected
i called because i just want
i need to talk
she sits on the couch her body language changing as she becomes a listener
ive been thinking about my life about things i have done
what i do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do
he sits on the other end of the couch his words thickened by the alcohol
i know that everything has a price
i want you to understand that im willing to pay
he takes out an envelope and puts it between them
she picks it up glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills
she puts the envelope down
i just want to ask you some questions
uncomfortable she waits as he searches his drink for the right words
do you ever regret things youve done
everyone regrets something
but when you finlsh a job afterwards do you think about them
do you think about their wives or their families
they call me i dont call them
if they didnt call i wouldnt exist
his next question is barely audible
do you ever think about starting over
all the time
can you tell me about it
for the first time we really see her take a drink
she closes her eyes
sometimes i dream that i meet a man this good honest man and we fall in love
i imagine us living on a boat reading books sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did
she opens her eyes and looks at him
and what if you never meet that man
then ill sail alone
do you believe that
are you asking me if i believe in another life
i have to
she finishes her drink
is that all you want
she picks up the money and stands
it is the same room but now it is very cluttered room service trays and empty liquor bottles tossed about
he has been here for a while
he is sitting at the table staring intensely at a chess game we see the board and all of the pieces set in the same positions as in the opening
he rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and then finishes off another bottle of bourbon
he flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches over the board and moves one of white knights taking a black rook
a sequence begins obvious and he works through it moving both the black and white pieces
suddenly he stops
he gets up and shifts to the other side of the board studying the game from whites perspective
another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through it as he moves around the table returning to his place behind the black king
the games reaches its end as black is check mated
he slumps down onto the table and looks across at the white king
fuck you nick
rath is at a desk where he has set up his computer office a cellular phone is plugged into a modem with cables winding through a scrambler and then into
a fax machine and the latest high powered lap top computer
on the table near the desk we see the
dismantled and cleaned spread out on a white towel
he types in a complicated access code sequence then waits staring at the blank screen
where have you been robert
i dont believe you
i dont give a fuck its true
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you
fuck you fuck cleveland and fuck your contracts i need a rest
thats impossible robert
youre at the top of your field
these are the best contracts
to stop now would be self destructive
he looks away from the screen and sees the chess game on the table
send the file
ill have the estimate tonight
im worried about you robert
you fucking should be dont be
on the screen the word transmitting appears
rath slowly gets out of his chair
the fax machine clicks and huxs to life as a photograph of a smiling old italian man curls onto the desk
rath begins destroying the hotel room smashing anything he can get his hands on
rath is in the middle of the room which he has demolished
having showered and shaved he is now standing naked in the midst of the rubble practicing the slow and graceful art of tai chi
rath is working at the desk
he is tallying numbers materials totaling his estimate
spread out over the table are several faxed photos of the old italian leevio valli usually surrounded by bodyguards
the file details vallis life and his daily routine
it includes phone bills credit card and bank account statements driver license and vehicle registration the real estate listing of his house and even a copy of his income tax
satisfied with his figures rath plugs the phone into the modem and makes a call
the network comes on line as the general contractor types youre too late robert
the contract was stolen
rath stares at the screen
a new player
hes using the name nicholai
the name hits rath and he sits unable to breathe
you know what must be done
the screen goes black as the network shuts down
rath looks down at the pile of assembled facts
he lifts a credit card bill on which the name of a restaurant appears every friday
the name of the restaurant has been circled in red pen by rath trattoria roma
a red awning spans the entrance of a popular italian restaurant
it is a large establishment with many tables and booths
the dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older italian families who have been eating here for years
rath is sitting alone at a booth
with very subtle changes to his appearance he looks like an older italian
in front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine
he touches neither of them
his eyes shift as he studies the room
leevio valli pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five gorillas in italian suits
the owner hurries to greet them hugging kissing speaking only italian
the entourage moves through the restaurant to the over sized booth in the back
rath does not look twice at them
immediately he is watching everyone else looking for the other assassin
leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit around the table obscuring him from all parts of the room
a wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and fills their glasses
a pretty waitress sets a steaming loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in front of leevio
he tells her something and she giggles
they joke in italian watching her ass as she wiggles back to the kitchen
at leevios table the wine steward returns to fill their glasses
it is the goon standing against the wall that is the first to realize that it is not the same wine steward
he is the second assassin much younger than rath
his name is bain
the goon reaches for his gun as bain shatters the bottle of wine into his face
leevio coughs a spray of minestrone as a gun flashes free from the white linen towel hung over the stewards arm
it happens instantly
four shots and the goons are dead
a fifth sixth and seventh shot
leevios body falls forward and softly thuds on the table
bain whips around drawing a small semi automatic weapon from his belt expecting an attack
facing the screaming crowd he begins to shoot anyone who moves or stands men or women
there is chaos in the restaurant
people scream falling to the ground scrambling under tables
bain is sweating his eyes shifting wildly from one end of the room to the other
the restaurant falls quiet except for several people who are sobbing
he moves through the room watching searching
dont anybody move
you move youre dead
he passes the table rath was sitting at but it is empty
come on you chicken shit motherfucker
i know youre here
across the street from trattoria roma rath jacks together a german assault rifle with night scope
bain looks out the window at the dark street
he turns and searches through the people huddled on the floor
he aims his gun
a quivering wine steward stands
he points to another
through the night scope we see the front door to the restaurant open and a group of wine stewards clumped together slowly back out
bain is second from the end both guns aimed at the stewards
one of them begins to cry
dont move or youre fucking dead
rath moves the scope back and forth unable to pick out the assassin
just do them all
all of them
he cant pull the trigger
the group moves toward the street
like dogs out of the gate they bolt
rath watches as they scatter finding bain in his scope
a chunk of brick explodes from the wall just behind bains head as he drops behind the row of parked cars along the curb
we get the idea that bain is enjoying this
rath looks over his scope talking to himself
he is sweating
what are you doing old man
youre too fucking slow
he looks back into the scope and begins scanning the line of cars
which one is yours
bain is crawling alongside the tightly parked cars staying low and out of sight
he works his way up to a black mercedes that is parked illegally next to a fire hydrant and takes out his keys
he hits the remote unlocking the doors
rath finds the fire hydrant in his scope almost obscured by the parked mercedes
he takes aim
just as bain starts to open the door the front tire explodes
another second the back tire explodes
rath waits steely calm his finger on the trigger
bain hears the growing wail of police sirens
thinking for a moment he opens the car door and pulls a long handled switchblade and a roll of electricians tape from the glove compartment
rath sees the car light go on but cant make out what bain is doing
the sirens are getting louder
theres a lot of them
bain finishes taping the knife to his forearm and rolls his shirt sleeve down
from his pocket he takes out a gameboy and begins playing tetris
rath watches as the police cars come racing down the street
the cars screech to a halt in front of the restaurant
the cops jump out drawing their weapons
bain throws his guns down raising his hands in the air
i give up
more cars come screeching up as the two officers hold their beads on bain
hit the ground
spread your legs
bain follows the orders as the second cop edges up to him frisking him
in this position the cop is unable to find the knife strapped to bains forearm but finds the gameboy
hey dont touch that
the cop twists bains arms behind his back handcuffing him tightly
they drag him to his feet a swarm of police and paramedics in the street
rath holds them in his cross hairs as they move to the police car but is unable to get a clean shot
bain is using the cops for cover keeping his head low
son of a bitch
the cops shove bain into the back seat
rath very quickly walks to his car tossing his gun into the trunk
he gets in and starts the engine
the two officers are outside the car talking with the sergeant
bain laying low beneath the windows peeks up at the shadowy parking garage
the two policemen get in the car the second picking up the radio
the driver guns the engine and the black and white rumbles down the street
this is returning with suspect involved in multiple shooting at trattoria roma
repeat en route with suspect
he hangs up the radio and looks back at bain through the metal caging
jesus christ do you know who you shot in there
bain almost laughs
what are you
some kind of a hitman
bain looks out the window
you know what we call guys like you
bain looks at him
theyre gonna fry your ass
he laughs at his own joke looking at his partner who chuckles
raths car races down the street trying to catch up with the patrol car
bain stares out the window silent
behind his back he takes hold of his left thumb with his right hand
the cop is playing with the gameboy
with a quick jerk he yanks the thumb out of its socket
his expression remains perfectly blank
the thumb hangs unnaturally from the hand
the skin stretches strangely as he pulls the metal cuff from his wrist
the cop turns as the switchblade clicks and bain sticks the knife through the wire mesh into the cops eye
a font of blood arcs onto the windshield
grabbing hold of the drivers shirt collar bain jabs the blade into the back of his neck
the driver screams trying to pull free of bains grip
he slams on the brakes groping for his gun and the car skids out of control
bain stabs the cop again his gun firing wildly as the patrol car starts to flip and roll
rath turns as he hears an explosion several blocks away
the tires squeal as he makes a hard right
orange flames lick up from the belly of the overturned patrol car
oil black clouds billow into the night sky
raths car cruises past
rath sees the back seat window shattered kicked out
bain is gone
im not done yet
a brand new cab is sitting at a red light
the cabby looks into the rearview mirror as a pair of headlights roll up behind him
the car gets closer the lights brighter they dont stop
he shrieks as the car smashes into his tearing off his the cabby jumps out rattling off a string of obscenities
rath gets out of the white car starting to apologize as the cabby moves toward him
when hes close enough rath decks him knocking him unconscious
he picks him up and puts him in the white car
rath then gets in the cab and when the light changes to green he drives off
rath circles the area turning up the cabs cb
a couple of calls crackle through the speaker before he hears what hes waiting for an airport fare in this area
at the intersection of adams and nine
he picks up the mike
i got it
it is a deserted intersection
the buildings are dark and some of the street lights are out
the cab sits by itself engine running its taillights glowing through the exhaust
rath holds his gun cocked beneath his coat
his other hand grips the door handle
as he waits watching the intersection he notices the cabbys id pinned to the dashboard
leaving the gun in his jacket he reaches for the id card
he rips it from the dash and as he drops it under the seat the door behind him opens
someone gets in and closes the door
rath peers into the rearview mirror
it is bain
for the first time we realize that the front and back of the cab is separated by an inch of bullet proof glass
there is an awkward silence as rath sits unsure
bain looks at him
is there a problem
the airport right
the cab pulls out of the intersection
rath studies bain
there is a thin line of blood down his temple
bain is oblivious to it and pulls out his gameboy resuming his game of tetris
howd you cut yourself
their voices are distorted through the small electric amplifier set in the bullet proof glass near the metal money exchanger
bain touches the blood on his forehead looking at it a bit surprised
a little accident
he wipes it off as best he can
you a waiter
you look like a waiter
bain is uninterested
yeah im a waiter
uh fontellas so youre from around here
no im not
bain is getting agitated
where you from
what is this
not too good at small talk eh
look im real tired and im not interested in fucking chit chat
i know just what you mean
im pretty beat myself
since you looked like a waiter i had to ask what restaurant because of what happened at the trattoria roma
bain looks up
didnt you here all them sirens
its been all over the radio
some guy shot leevio valli and a bunch of bystanders in the trattoria roma
yeah its terrible
i mean valli and i dont care what office hes running for the guys a crook
he probably had it coming but all the other people
but they caught the guy
i heard it all
sounded like he just went berserk fucking loco
id love to sit in that jury
send that s
right to the chair
bain allows himself a bemused smile
the cab passes the intersection for the airport
bain sits up
what are you doing
that was peterson back there
that goes to the expressway for the airport
talking too much again
yeah well you just blew your tip pal
you think im running you up
just do your job
rath pulls over and slaps the cab in park
what are you doing
you think im running you up
you cant the hell i cant
its my cab
i dont like you
so get the hell out
bain cant figure out what is wrong when he sees the dashboard and the missing id
their eyes meet in the rearview mirror
holy fucking shit
the cab rocks as both men move
instantly guns fill their hands
bain ripping out a
lifted from one of the dead cops
rath rolls to the side whipping the gun free from his jacket
bain throws open the door about to run but stops
he looks at rath
he wants him to run
anyone who moves away from the bullet proof glass is dead
both men are silent each holding the other in their gun sights
bain blinks sweat forming on his lip
i get out you got me
bain reaches over and closes the door
he smiles knowing it is the right move
rath calmly uncocks his gun
were both going to the airport
put your seatbelt on
no fucking way
if either of us fucks around the other can blow the fuel line
he points his gun at the floor where the fuel line runs
bain sits back aiming his gun watching rath
rath eases back into the drivers seat also holding his gun on the fuel line
he puts the car into drive and slides back into traffic turning back towards peterson
they sit in silence studying each other when they hit the expressway
bain cant contain himself giddy on adrenaline
jesus im being driven to the airport by robert rath
i cant believe this
you rolled some cabby for the radio then waited for an airport fare
he laughs again
boy thats fucking genius
youre a fucking genius
then youre just sitting there bullshitting with me
man no way i coulda done that
whats your name
we both know its not nicholai
robert rath wants to know my name
he leans back
this is a big moment for him
how long have you been freelance
two long fucking years
something occurs to him and he leans close to the window
what i dont get was why didnt you take the shot inside the restaurant
i mean you had me a free shot
thats what i would have done
its just a shoot out then
sixty forty at best
not my odds
sounds like chickenshit he laughs hard
listen to me calling you chickenshit
he stops laughing and looks closely at the back of raths head
is that a wig
shit i hate wigs
wigs are the worst part of this job
id rather dye my hair than wear a wig
rath studies him
youre wearing a wig now
bain chokes on his laugh
god damn are you good
everyone says youre so fucking good
i just cant believe im still alive
if i believed in god id be down on my knees
right now hey how come you just didnt plug us all when we came through the door
rath does not answer
he knows something about rath now he doesnt like killing innocent people
shit if i was you back there he holds his gun up to the bulletproof glass behind raths head
do you mind if i ask you a couple of business questions
you know i was wondering how much you bid this job at
rath says nothing
you dont have to tell me that
its just i know my bid was low but was it too low
i mean did i seem like an amateur like i didnt know what i was doing
we both know what you were doing
bain moves close to the glass again checking out raths gun
smith and wesson
with an eight inch silencer
when i first heard you used that i thought shit thats a ladys gun
now its all i use
clean real clean
he looks at the gun still trained at the floor
would you really blow us
rath does not have to answer
i got a question
jesus this has been driving me crazy for years shit listen to me
i sound like some fucking fanboy
im sorry but i just got to ask you
everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian nicholai talinkov tachlinkov
yeah thats it
and hes like a fucking genius
they said he shaded you over and over
and in the end he aced you again
shaded and faded
they say hes living on some greek island but i say thats fucking bullshit
i say youre the best and that you planted his ass
am i right
rath says nothing
i bet im right
the car passes under a sign indicating the ramp for the cleveland airport
robert bain driving me
jesus fucking christ
after those cops youll never be able to come back to cleveland
who the fuck cares about cleveland
what kind of marks have they got here
greasy mobster teamster or some hand job politician
i want the money marks
i want the marks that you get
a long beat of silence
the cab rumbles up onto the departures ramp which circles past all of the terminals
so what happens now
we go around once
he throws off his seatbelt
you tell me that were gonna go around once then while im checking out the lay of the land you bail out and send me flying over the bridge
am i right
rath doesnt answer studying the terminals noting the police and airport security
rath studies the terrain
bain studies rath
soon they have passed the entire airport
steering the car through traffic in onto a circle interchange that will bring them to the beginning
bain wipes the sweat from his face
rath begins to accelerate rounding the interchange
what are you doing
theres a sand barricade up ahead im going to ram this cab into it
the cab has an airbag odds are good ill survive
but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass odds for you are not so good
oh man thats sweet
thats fucking sweet
the speedometer continues to climb
rath says nothing
ahead at the ramp to the terminals is the sand barricade
youre fucking with me
you want me to jump
i jump you hit the brakes and bang game over
the cab is flying at its target
you dont want me to jump
youre going to jump
im stuck back here until its too late
i know youre going to jump
bain looks at him and then at the barricade
youre still young
young enough to still think youre indestructible
you believe with utter certainty you can bail out at the last second and survive
the barricade hurtles toward them rising up filling the windshield
if you do survive well see each other again
bain screams throwing open the door and hurling himself out
rath jams on the brakes tires screaming steering into the steel side rail banking the car into the drums of sand as bain hits the pavement bouncing like a stone
skipped across water
a driver hits his brakes swerving just missing him
sand explodes from the impact and the cab bounces up over the median into the bus only lanes as the drivers airbag balloons out of the steering wheel
bain rolls and rolls finally stopping sprawled out like a piece of roadkill
the cab careens up onto a curb slamming into a pole the radiator spitting out a cloud of whistling steam
several cars lock up and collide to avoid bain one car stopping inches from him
a woman jumps out rushing to the front of the car but bain is gone
police cars roar up into the midst of the accident
one of them pulling alongside the demolished cab
the door is open the airbag popped
rath is gone
a large six flat leans out from a hill in san francisco
the apartment is always dark heavy drapes cover the windows
the dining and living rooms look like the control booth of a network television show stacks of video monitors and consoles cables electric wiring coils of fiber optic cord duct
taped to the floors walls and ceilings
they snake through holes punched in the plaster walls and hang everywhere like some technological jungle
at the center of this tangled web is electra a beautiful athletic looking woman wearing only her underwear and a worn robe
she is curled up in an overstuffed chair a bowl of popcorn in her lap
on the monitors she is watching what at first might be mistaken for a soap opera a young couple are having an argument
what is strange is that the angle never changes a fish eye lens staring down into the room
i dont give a shit what your mother thinks
im not sleeping with your mother im sleeping with you
you wont be for long with that attitude
jesus jennifer if youre so god damned worried about your mothers approval why dont you move back home so she can pat you on the head when you do something
jennifer is too stunned to say anything
there is a long pause that is not at all like television
it seems very real
she starts to say something but stops trying to keep herself from crying
go ahead and cry
would you please leave
electra lifts her head smelling the air
mmm smell that nikita
nikita electras black cat is stretched lazily across the top of a chair her tail twitching absently
every corner of the chair has been clawed open
electra reaches for the control board and throws a series of switches
the monitors flicker as the image changes
we are now looking down into a kitchen
a stove is beneath us almost like a cooking show where a round woman is taking out a tray of chocolate chip cookies
electra smells them again smiling as she inhales
i hope she saves some for us
there is a bang a door slamming in another apartment and a man yelling
electra switches back to jennifers apartment
the man is still in the living room but jennifer is gone
do you think slamming doors is going to help work this out
electra punches a command into a keyboard
several of the screens change showing different rooms of the same apartment
jennifer is in the bedroom lying on the bed sobbing her face buried in a pillow
i can slam doors too
we hear the front door slam in the hall outside of electras apartment and through the monitor speakers
his stomping footsteps fade as he storms down the hall and staircase out of the building
electra switches all of the screens to jennifer
she watches and listens to her cry alone in her bedroom
electra reaches out her fingers lightly touch the monitor screen
electras front door opens slowly
timidly she steps out of her apartment and walks down the hall until she is standing in front of jennifers door
she starts to knock but stops herself
she isnt sure she should do this
she paces then turns to the door
she knocks so softly its almost impossible to hear
she stands trying to force herself to knock again when she hears jennifer
ken is that you
the door knob turns the door opens and jennifer looks out into the hall
it is empty
on the monitors electra watches jennifer pick up the phone
hi mom its me
ken and i just had a big fight
electras pager suddenly sounds
she shuts down the screens and pulls out the pager checking the number
there is a system set up that is not unlike raths system all of the same components though the equipment is bigger more powerful and less portable
on a table there is a bank of phones several cellular
electra is talking on one
electra they are not paying you to sit at home and watch television
electra is fiddling with five plastic computer disks each has a microcell trademark and is labeled back up
i wasnt watching television
the point is they are paying for information
not tooth paste brands
not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper
and no hours of recorded phone sex
you are wasting everyones time with this shit
i thought it was interesting god damnit electra
this is not a game
this is business
in my hands i have five back up disks he made of all of his work last night
why didnt you tell me
ill make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus
electra a pleasure doing business with you
she hangs up
electra comes down the stairs
outside the large glass door she sees ken jennifers boyfriend leaving
on the lobby floor is a letter apparently slipped under the door addressed to jennifer morgan
electra looks out the front door window making sure that ken is gone
she picks up the letter and stuffs it into her pocket
rath is at his computer system
he is staring at it like it is a living thing a person that he despises the blank screen reflecting his own face
it is an effort to bring himself to touch the keyboard to type in his code
rath wants to type something but hesitates
i know what happened
i bet you fucking know
it cost us
rath jumps out of his chair screaming at the screen
i give a fuck
do you fucking hear me
im fucking gone
he stole another contract
rath turns from the monitor pacing
trying to collect himself
im being set up
fucking set up
he looks at the chess board
he hovers over it the pattern completely familiar
is this how it went nick
rath turns back to the screen speaking as he types
how did he know
the fucking contract
how in the fuck did he know
a long beat
such language in front of a lady
rath still talking and typing
i dont know what the fuck you are
it was a joke
rath stands no longer typing
rath takes out his gun and levels it at the face of the screen
you think this is a fucking joke
rath looks at the number
thats the bonus on the contract
rath puts the gun down
the buyer is japanese
his retirement a condition of the bonus
the fax machine comes to life printing an inky image
who is the mark
we have an m
her system is protected by her pussy virus
rath looks at the fax almost entirely black except for the wide slit iris cat eyes
there is a screech and blast of engines as a touches down heat rising off the tarmac
several passengers walk through the gate into the terminal
across from the gate rath sits in a grungy airport cafeteria reading a folded paper
he is wearing an airport security uniform a gun holstered to his side
taped inside the newspaper is a faxed interpol photograph of a japanese man wanted for industrial espionage
at the gate five japanese men emerge
leading the group is the man in raths photo
the other four are obviously muscle
rath watches as they walk down the crowded terminal hall
when they are almost out of sight he folds his newspaper and begins to follow
his pace and manner is that of a cautious predator
his focus shifts continually from face to face expecting to find bains
his hand hovers near his gun
ahead of him a thin young man wearing a long blue trench coat stops
rath cannot see his face
the man starts toward a drinking fountain
rath catches a glimpse of his face
it could be bain but he isnt sure
the young man bends over and slurps at the stream of water
he rises into the barrel of raths
a mouthful of water coughs from his mouth
it is not bain and in the next instant the gun is gone
they young man is unable to move
the five men stride through the automated terminal doors and towards a waiting limousine
further down rath now wearing a black t shirt and jeans exits and hails a cab
up ahead my boss is in that black limo
were not sure which hotel were at so could you just follow them
rath sits back studying the faces exiting the terminal as the cab pulls away
the five men sit in silence
strangely a phone begins to the older man whose name is akira opens his briefcase removing a cellular phone
we hear electras voice
she speaks in japanese he uses english
i trust your flight was comfortable
your japanese is excellent
tell the driver the hyatt hotel
electra is pacing talking into the cellular phone
ill call you again in twenty minutes
she punches a button and shoves the antennae down
the hotel room looks like her apartment
there is a computer and a series of monitors stacked on top of the wood laminate desk
cables whip and wind across the carpeted floor to the central air duct
the panel has been removed and intertwined black and gray coaxial run up inside the duct
immediately electra is busy finishing her preparations
she snaps in several power cords and the system comes on line
on the monitor screen we see an empty hotel room that looks exactly like the one she is in
rath stares out the window watching the surrounding traffic the limo still in sight
something occurs to him and he looks down at the folded newspaper where he had hid the contract file
he flips past several documents before finding what hes looking for the cat
he pulls the dark fax of nikita and stares at it
laying on the bed in a patch of sunlight nikita watches electra rush about
electra grabs the sheet from under the comforter and yanks it out
excuse me your highness
nikita casually walks off the bed
electra takes the sheet to the open duct and tears off a long piece of duct tape
the limousine pulls up in the lavish circular driveway
the cab pulls in behind it
electra checks her watch and picks up the cellular phone
the japanese men stand in a cluster looking very rigid and uncomfortable
the briefcase rings
electra is pacing again
with several other guests the japanese men crowd into an elevator
the doors close
across the lobby rath enters walking past the elevators
as the elevator rises we begin to hear a sound a familiar sound
cramped in the corner is bain
he is playing tetris wearing dark sunglasses and a walkman pumping speed metal into his ears
electra continues to pace checking the monitors
at the switchboard a young hotel employee wearing an operators headset takes a late breakfast order typing the order in the hotel computer
thatll be up in about thirty minutes
he turns around and rath is right behind him
the fourteenth floor the bell chimes the doors slide open and the clump of japanese men get out
just as the doors begin to close bain steps out
bain follows them down the hall still playing the game
there is again an ominous sense of predator moving in on its prey
as akira finds and opens the door another door burst open a large family heading for the pool
the moment is gone the japanese men close the door and bain continues down the hall again playing the game
when the japanese men enter the suite we realize that this is the image on electras monitors
surveillance camcorders and microphones are mounted in various locations to display every inch of the room
the group hesitates for a moment under the electronic eyes
the four goons have their hands in their jackets
a small laptop computer sits on the coffee table humming softly
it is the only noise in the room until a speaker crackles
good morning gentlemen
i apologize for the arrangement but we all know those arent business cards youre reaching for
if anyone leaves this room the deals off
the operator is unconscious slumped in the corner
rath studies the hotel computer screen intently the information rolling by
we see that it is the previous nights room service receipts
one vegetarian plate and a can of tuna fish
electra stands in front of the monitors watching the men as she speaks into the microphone
ten thousand dollars per disk
insert the first disk now
on the monitor we see akira at the coffee table shove the first disk into the laptop disk drive
akira turns from the small computer screen and nods at a goon who drops a green brick of bound one hundred dollar bills down the central air duct
the little clock on the laptop ticks away as it copies
bain is sitting on a bench entrenched in a fevered game of suddenly he stops
the display of the game reads game over and congratulates bain on a new high score
bain stands smiling
he puts the game in his pocket and starts down the hall
electra is crouched at the open duct grabbing another stack of money stuffing it into her bag
a loud bang explodes out of the speakers and she looks up at the monitor
the lock on the door has been broken and standing in the frame is bain
he raises his arm his gun spitting silent bullets
electra stares in horror at the monitors as bain grabs the nearest bodyguard firing a shot into his belly
another shot and the second bodyguard falls
the other two draw their handguns and bain shields himself with the lifeless body of his first victim
they fire at bain but are unable to hit him
bain squeezes off two more shots and the two men fall dead
he lets his human shield fall to the ground and levels his gun on the shaking akira
dont kill me
bain looks at him and smiles then fires
electra leaps at the computer ripping the cord from the modem
bain sees the fiber optic cable and looks right into it
boy you just cant trust anyone these days
he licks the lens leaving a smear of saliva
she stuffs the disks into her bag
she puts nikita in her travel kitty and charges for the door grabbing her coat
flinging it over her shoulder she does not notice the letter from ken slip out of her pocket as she bolts from the room
electra explodes through the door and suddenly freezes
she is staring down the barrel of raths
dont be stupid and you will live
the elevator behind rath opens and closes against a hotel lobby ashtray
he waves her into the elevator with his gun
electras black car roars out of the garage onto the open street
the door swings open
from the hall we can hear the familiar beeping of the computer game
the room is the same as electra had left it when she ran out
jutting from a shadow on the floor is the corner of kens letter
electra drives obviously nervous as rath watches out the rear window
no one follows
he turns back to her
how many bodies were there
he checks his watch
he has to clean up
how many bodies were there
one hour per man
rath sets the timer on his watch for five hours
bain has returned to room
wearing rubber gloves he clicks open a black leather attache and pulls out a can of rug cleaner
he picks up the phone for room service
this is room behind him in the bathroom mirror we see one of the japanese men hanging from the shower by his feet
he is naked
yes could you send up a pot of coffee and my friends are going to need some more towels
he hangs up the phone and walks over to one of the large blood stains on the carpet
he points the rug cleaner at the stain covering it with white foam
rath sees the entrance for the expressway
get on the expressway
where are we going
rath glances back
electra turns onto the highway and nikita howls from the travel kitty in the back seat
nikita wants out and howls again
she wont stop unless you let her out
rath reaches back and opens the box
nikita springs into the front seat onto raths lap
she helped me find you
how did you know i had a cat
took a guess
lucky for you i guessed right
who the fuck are you
who do you work for
i work for the government
she studies his face his eyes
youre one of them arent you
a fucking pro
im part of the game just like you
electra pounds the steering wheel
he reaches into the back seat grabbing her bag
what do you think youre doing
rath plucks out the bundles of money
what do you mean thats all
what in the hell do you know
the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars
electra seems ready to jump out of her skin
the speedometer is floating around
he pulls out the disks
i figure that means these are worth ten times that maybe more
ten million now you understand why im here
electra wants to scream
the speedometer is climbing over
i really think you should slow down
the room is immaculate near the door several over sized suitcases line the wall
bain is sitting at the desk
his walkman is on music blasting as he flips casually through the telephone directory
his finger eases down a column stopping at morgan jennifer
there is a knock at the door
he smiles and tears out the page
there is another louder knock which bain hears this time
he turn off the walkman and opens the door a bellboy is waiting with a luggage cart
have you some luggage you need carried
bain gives him a wink and a smile
indeed i do
the red low fuel light is on
turn off the engine
electra twists the ignition and the car dies
rath glances around and we see the car is parked in a gas station
you want me to pump
no stay in the car
i want you to understand something
if i intended to kill you you would already be dead
electra says nothing
he reaches over and takes the car keys
when he is out of the car electra slowly releases the strangle hold she had on the steering wheel
okay nikita stay calm think breathe think
electra checks the rear view mirror listening as rath pumps the gas
her eyes flash down to her bag
outside rath watches electra through the windows
she appears motionless
the electric gas counter races like a stop watch
in the car electra eases her hand into her bag
the tank full rath re hangs the pump
he walks around the car and heads for the station
electra waits until his back is turned
she pulls her tool pouch from her bag throws it open and finds her wire stripper
reaching under the dash she yanks out a tangled handful of wire
she looks up rath is inside paying
come on come on its a cake walk
her fingers fly with surgical precision snipping stripping twisting
rath steps out of the station as her head pops up looking for him
it takes only a second for him to realize what she is doing
he runs at the car as she strips the last set of wires and strikes them the battery grinds
he is almost there when the engine fires
she stomps on the gas ramming the shift into drive
tires squealing the car swerves forward as rath slams into it
he bounces backward falling to the ground
the car fishtails away accelerating as rath rolls to one knee his gun automatically in his hand
he draws a bead but he does not shoot
with a concerted effort he puts the gun away
electras car is parked out front
she unlocks the lobby door and drags herself inside
standing at the mailboxes flipping through her mail is jennifer morgan
what she was hoping for is not there
she looks up and sees electra
excuse me electra stops
you live here dont you
im sorry this may sound really weird but my friend told me he slipped a letter under the door here and i was wondering if you happened to see it
electra is in a daze her hand moving into her pocket
he said he saw a woman with dark hair going into the building when he dropped it off
i dont have it
electras mouth opens and she backs away
jennifer is bothered by her reaction and she doesnt push it
i didnt mean to im sorry
she shrugs and unlocks the interior door leaving electra in the lobby
electra watches her as her hand moves from pocket to pocket
a worried expression tightens her face the letter is gone
she opens the interior door following jennifer up the stairs
electra climbs the stairs her mind pouring through the possibilities filled with fear
by the time electra reaches the top floor jennifer is entering her apartment
electra hurries past jennifers door to her own
electra flies across the living room to the monitors
she clicks them on putting on jennifers channel
on the screen we see jennifer in her living room checking her phone messages
one from her mother
electra throws a few switches so that jennifers entire apartment is in front of her
on one of the monitors we see a shadow slide across the oak floor as something moves along the edge of the room
jennifer has moved to the bathroom and is drawing a bath
electra clamps her hand over her mouth when he steps out
bain moves into the dining room where jennifer had just been
wearing rubber surgeons gloves he picks up the mail that she had dropped on the table and sorts through it
bain moves about the apartment with complete indifference to jennifers presence as if he were invisible as though he knew she couldnt see him
he moves into a room just as she moves out
electra watches dizzy sick with terror but she is unable to turn away
bain searches through a desk drawer while jennifer starts undressing for her bath
he walks down the hall and stands outside of the bathroom
if jennifer would turn around she would see him
electra is about to run to call out when something catches bains eye
he moves into the bedroom and is turned so that he is looking straight up into the camera
he inches towards it not sure what it is
the fiber optic cable is hidden in the light fixture hanging over the bed
staring at it he is looking right at electra
bain steps up onto the bed his face distorting as he moves close to the fish eye lens
poking it with his finger he realizes what it is
a warped smile stretches across his face as he whispers oh you sick little bitch electra tears away from the screen panic seizing hold of her
she rips entire drawers out of her dresser dumping them into a suitcase stuffing in anything that looks important
she grabs nikita in the travel kitty
the door opens and electra jumps out slamming it behind her as bain turns from the back stairs
she leaps back inside as he whips out his gun pumping two holes in the door
she scrambles from the kitchen throwing her suitcase still clutching the travel kitty as the back door explodes from its hinges bain charging firing his gun
bullets hissing past her electra crashes through the front door into the hall
the stairs are at the far end
she is only halfway when rath rises up the stairs his gun cocked
electra drops to the floor as behind her bain barrels from the apartment
the wood door splinters bullet holes surrounding bain
off balance he lunges back into the apartment
rath continues firing grabbing hold of electra
they run down the stairs
bain leaps down the flights
bain rushes into the street looking in every direction
they are gone
somewhere in the city
electra and rath enter the room together but they are both immediately alone
she walks across the room to a chair in the corner curling into it even as nikita jumps up and curls into her lap
he sets his briefcase on the table at the opposite end of the room and sits
they watch each other
between then is the liquor cabinet
rath knows a good idea when he sees one
want a drink
her face is as expressionless as nikitas
he pours himself a very large bourbon and slugs it down
takes a deep breath then pours himself another one
he returns to his table with his drink
im not good at this sort of thing but we dont have a lot of time so ill just go ahead and get started
i ask myself what is she thinking
her body tightens coils
shes almost been killed twice and now she is alone in a room with a man that she believes is an
another deep pull on the bourbon
furthermore she was brought here not entirely on her own accord which only increases her fear and suspicion
thus as long as she is afraid her first maybe her only thought will be escape
does that leave me any other option
he slugs down the rest of his drink and stands whipping out his gun
crossing the room he turns the gun around and offers it to her
she looks at it
back at him
he puts it on the bed beside her turns his back and walks to the bar
she picks up the gun
the gun is silenced
she could shoot me right now
she stands nikita jumping from her lap
she could take the car and be far from here before the maid comes in the morning but she starts squeezing off rounds the lamp explodes the chairs around him
erupt tufts of white stuffing leaping into the air
he freezes bottle in one hand glass in the other
stop trying to tell me what im thinking
she moves closer to him the gun squeezed in her fist
ill tell you what youre thinking you think im not going to shoot you but right now youre not so sure are you
a slight shake of the head no
youre thinking that maybe it was a mistake to give me this gun that maybe im not going to think about things logically because im a woman and im freaked
out and im going to do something impulsive and irrational right
she fires the gun to both sides of his head
hes surprised to be alive
you dont know shit about me
now sit down
he returns to his chair and sits with the same expression she had worn sitting a moment ago
she opens the cabinet and grabs one of the sample bottles of liquor
she sucks it all down and throws the bottle across the room
grabbing another she sits on the edge of the bed
how did you find me
youre the computer hacker you tell me
you didnt know anything about me
nikita rubs up against her leg
v for veterinarian
there arent that many
she nods slurping at her bottle
youre one of them arent you
until a minute ago
what does that mean
if i still was what i used to be you would not be pointing that at me
electra eyes him considers shooting him right now
who is that other guy
someone hired both of you
they hired bain
the contract would have been mine but bain took it from me as he took the previous one
so this is something between you and him
he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him
because he is trying to retire me
he wants to kill you
the nature of the business
you remove your competition
and you want to use me to get him
we dont have a choice
she fires the gun pocking the wall behind him
dont tell me i dont have a choice
im two seconds away from making my choice which means youve got two seconds to tell me why i shouldnt shoot you
you need me
i need you
and we will both need money
i dont need you to get the money my money
if it hadnt been for me you would be dead
shes up pacing knowing there is some truth in that
i dont need the money
this is something that is never going to end
you can never work in the business again with this contract because he will find you
to survive you have to go into deep hiding
and thats going to take money a lot of money
then you can have the disks and ill just walk out that door if you walk out that door bain will still come after you
because he took a contract on you
hell come for you and hell find you
you dont know that youre trying to scare me
its the truth
i know what you are
like me like bain youre a ghost youre not part of the real world
you dont have a social security number
you dont pay taxes
youve probably used ten different names over the last ten years
a long time ago something probably happened something illegal and you ran you disappeared and it was easy
you think you can do it again
but im telling you fading from the law is nothing
no matter what you do where you go i swear to you that bain will find you
right now as we sit here he is tearing through your apartment
he is digging through your drawers emptying your closets
he will take your telephone and address books your appointment books
if you keep a diary he is reading it
hell go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat liquor you drink cigarettes you smoke
in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled
if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them
she is coming unglued
imagining him watching her tapes going through her possessions
she is moving pacing ready to explode
oh jesus jesus
he will know everything about you
i know because ive done it
once youve been inside a marks home youre in their head
if youre any good youll find the mark in a week and bain is good because i was the best and i couldnt take him
she whirls and starts firing the gun firing it everywhere fear and anger rocketing out of her in whistling hot wads of lead
when she stops he starts to say something but she levels the gun at him
youve said enough
she forces herself back grabbing handfuls of the sample bottles
i need to think
to be alone
with the gun and an armful of booze and nikita following at her feet she goes into the bathroom and slams the door
she locks the door and then collapses
her body seems to fold up onto itself as she slides down the wall the gun and the bottles falling from her arms clattering softly on the bath rug as
she buries her face in her hands
very mechanically rath begins setting up his chess board putting the pieces into the same positions
it is a ritual and with it he enters a kind of trance
from the bathroom almost inaudible he hears electra with her head now buried in her arms and knees she is sobbing her body rocking
the crying seems very similar to jennifers a complete emotional release
rath stares at the board
the crying grows louder
he stands and walks to the door
he starts to knock but stops himself
like electra with jennifer rath would like to help he just has no idea how to
he turns back to the desk to his chess game
her eyes are now burning red
she stops crying long enough to suck down an entire sample of scotch
nikita rubs against her and she strokes her
oh shit nikita
rath is setting up his computer system
he hears the tub nikita jumps up onto the toilet seat and starts drinking
electra finishes another sample and drops it to the floor where we see that many of the bottles are now empty
in the tub steam rising off the surface she wrings out a wash cloth and covers her face sinking deeper into the water
when electra comes out of the bathroom rath is again at his chess game
she sits down across from him and sets the gun on the table between them
rath looks up at her
listen i dont even know your name
as in daughter of agamemnon
the conversation dies
what im trying to say is that im not sure i can do this help you unless i know more about you
what do you want to know
if bain hadnt taken the contract on me would you have
he stares at her
because im done
this is crazy
i cant trust you
you cant trust me
how can we possibly help each other
they sit in silence the gun and the chess game lying between them
do you play
she looks at the chess board
its not the same is it
better than playing with yourself
i had an opponent
she understands that he is trying to tell her something
he was russian
a legend in the business when i was just starting
i admired him
when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game
electra studies the board
he was white
it looks like whites game
we played with a code using the new york times obituaries
over three years we played twelve matches
i never won
why didnt you finish this game
she reaches over and lifts a white knight and takes a bishop
rath counters taking her knight
he was killed
throughout the entire conversation they continue to play out the chess game
a long beat
i killed him
because thats how it works
thats what its about
he was the best
he was on top
where you wanted to be
as soon as you get into this business all you can think about is getting to the top
thats all there is
until then there is nothing
you are nothing
how did you get into the business
the same way everyone does the government the agency
more or less
how old were you
they recruited me when i was in high school
i was already fluent in nine languages
you were like a boy genius
some people said that
i never thought so
i was just different
you went from high school to the agency
i graduated from george washington university
then i entered the agency training program
they didnt give you a choice did they
no they didnt
but you knew what they were training you for
i was going to be james bond
they are very good at what they do
its very seductive
the training the weapons the travel the exotic women
i dont want to talk about women
because you are a women
why did you leave the agency
the same reason everyone does
you hear your name on c span and you realize youre a skeleton in someones closet and theyre coming to bury you
they tried to kill you
it didnt matter much to them as long as i disappeared
then you went freelance
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government so you make more money
then once you make the transition you realize you were never working for the government it was always the private sector the vested interests and its the same vested interests
that continue to buy your plane tickets
tell me about the first time
my first take
because i want to know
it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
are they usually like that
just the first one
they become complicated
did it ever bother you
did it ever bother james bond
this is fiction
dont you see that
this is another reality
and the people that come into the world to play this game nobody forces them
theyre here they know the rules the stakes the risks
do you understand what i am saying
no one is innocent including you
does that mean it didnt bother you
rath leans back and stares at her
you get a job swinging a hammer the first day you get a blister it tears open it bleeds and it stays sore a long time
you keep swinging the hammer you get a good hard callous that covers that spot and it never bothers you again
electra says nothing
he leans forward and slides a rook into her back row
he leans back
is that what you wanted to hear
something cold blooded
rath likes this woman
she moves her queen
i hope your plan is better than your game
the room is ugly
shag carpeting wood paneling and polyester patterned curtains
we hear a computer keyboard clicking away as we move across a table
the hotel phone is in a modem which is held together with duct tape
between the modem and the computer is a scrambler constructed out of a series of naked circuit boards
it is a very similar set up to raths only it has been put together with a fraction of the resources
bain sits typing at the computer his shirt off
beside the desk top is a six pack of old style beer a bag of doritos and his gameboy
on the floor disassembled neatly on a small white towel is his cleaned gun
bain finishes punching in a code sits back and sucks down his beer
where have you been michael
he is communicating with his general contractor
on the table is a collection of personal objects much of it stuffed in pillow cases taken from electras house
tracking the mark
bain fingers a pair of satin panties
he smiles as he smells them
im on the scent
youre too late
bain slams his beer down
ive learned from microcell rath fulfilled the contract
he took out the mark and sold the disks back to microcell
bain falls back in his chair thinking
he runs his hands through his sweaty hair
i dont believe it
they money will be standard bank transfer
we believe we will know where and when
there is no response
how in the fuck do you know that
a long beat
such language in front of a lady
i dont give a fuck what you are
i asked you he hits the repeat key
types how in the fuck do you know that
do you want rath or not
bain stares at the screen thinking
another computer screen but we dont know that it is different
it will take three days to arrange the transfer
we are in electra and raths hotel room
she is standing behind him reading as he types
are you going to tell him
for all i know it could be a machine
you said you didnt trust it
what kind of bank is going to allow us to withdraw ten million dollars the day it is transferred
the kind preferred by drug smugglers arms dealers and politicians
rath types in an account number
do you have a passport
where is it
rath and electra are sitting in the first class section which she is obviously enjoying smiling and sipping champagne
god i love first class
i remember when i was a little girl i would wonder what it was like up here
i would always try to peek through the curtains
rath says nothing staring out the window
electra shakes her head
i hope nikitas all right
he still does not respond
hey where are you
electra sips the last of her champagne
ive never been to the gulf of mexico
is it as nice as they say
i dont know
you were there
a long beat
the plane lands
rath and electra hand their bags to a cabby who puts them in his trunk
rath speaks perfect spanish
in spanish good afternoon
we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca
in spanish yes sir
the cab pulls up in front of a large brand new glass hotel which shimmers in the blue green reflection of the gulf water
rath is upset
in spanish no no
i said the hotel paraiso
in spanish yes
this is the hotel paraiso
in spanish no the other hotel paraiso in the city
near the plaza del sol
in spanish im sorry sir
a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso
this is the new hotel paraiso
in spanish take us there
american tourist dollars have built up the coasts but much of the out lying city is very poor
the old hotel paraiso is a five story blackened husk
the face of the building is burnt black and it seems to hang in space as something non corporeal like the shadow of the building rather than the building itself
rath stares at it remembering
electra is behind him standing in the midst of the plaza del sol
he looks up to the fifth story window then turns directly opposite of that
the international banco de mexico an enormous beautiful old building its exterior walls are white washed concrete blindingly bright white
electra looks at the bank and smiles
so thats where all that s l money is
rath is not listening to her
he is somewhere else
he turns back to the fourth story window
thats where hell be
i wasnt expecting this
i need to think
beyond the lights of the hotel the gulf darkens to midnight oil
on one side of the elevator is a young couple who look like newlyweds
they are cuddling kissing and giggling as though they are alone
electra and rath are on the other side of the elevator
it is a strange contrast
electra is staring at them
rath behind his sunglasses is in his own world
the elevator chimes and opens
the doors chime again and start to close as everyone realizes that this is their floor
rath and the other man grab the doors which spring back open
it is a funny awkward moment as everyone apologizes and smiles politely on the way out
the couple move down the hall the newlyweds finding their door first
rath reaches the door to their room opens it and enters
electra lingers watching the other couple watching as he fumbles for his keys her hand running up between his legs and over his ass
he finally manages to open the door and she pushes him inside
electra softly closes her door
rath is sitting in a desk chair staring out of the sliding balcony doors at the dark gulf water
did you see them
electra moves about the large suite
they looked like they were in love
rath says nothing
well i think ill take a bath
come on nikita
the two of them walk into the bathroom leaving rath to himself
electra sits on the edge of the over sized tub water running through her fingers as she adjusts the temperature
after a beat she hears a small crash a glass breaking
it is followed by other muffled noises a woman giggling and a thumping
the sounds are coming from the other side of the tub wall from the other suite
electra puts her ear against the tile to listen
the water filling her tub is too loud for her to hear
she turns it off
there is more bumping and thumping the woman laughing and then the laughs shorten into soft whimpers
electra hangs on each sound slowly lifted by it moving up toward the over head fan and ducts
the sounds get louder as she moves closer to the vents until she is standing precariously on the edge of the tub listening to what is clearly the sounds of
two people their moans and shrieks climax and electra smiles
it is dark now
a single desk light is on under which rath is setting up his chess board putting the pieces in their familiar pattern
electra comes out of the bathroom
she seems very clean and fresh wearing a long white t shirt and thin robe
that felt great
you should try it
she watches him setting the pieces onto the board
dont you ever get tired of playing the same game
he looks at her
it helps me to focus
it centers me helps me think
what do you think about
the things i need to get done
she sits across from him looking at the board
do you think about the game
but youve never figured out a way to win
not even a stalemate
what happens if you do
this strikes rath as a very strange question and he is suddenly annoyed by her
can i ask you something
he knows she will anyway
what will you do if this works if we get the money
i dont know
maybe ill live on a boat sail to all the places ive never been
that sounds nice
he finishes his glass of bourbon
she is not sure what to say next if she should say anything at all
im kind of tired
i think id like to try and get some sleep
you can have the bed
the chair is fine for me
he pours himself another drink dropping in some ice from the ice bucket
she slips out of the robe and in between the sheets
rath sits across the room his back to her
she tries to make herself comfortable but cannot
do you think hes here
in costa blanca
what do you think hes doing
i dont know
but im sure hes not sleeping
she pulls the covers tightly to her chin
her eyes do not close
a small hotel in the city away from the beaches built before there was such a thing as central air conditioning
bain is naked except for a small pair of camouflage jockeys and his walkman strapped to his shoulder
his head is pumping wildly with the speed metal thrashing in his ears
he is tearing open a long box wrapped in happy birthday paper
inside the box is a massive black hi tech assault rifle
he assembles it quickly snapping it together with automatic ease
when the sight is tightened in place he jumps up
in the mirror over the dresser he poses down with the gun
not satisfied he grabs his shades and checks himself again
he starts moving with the music playing with the gun first as a guitar then whipping it around spinning it expertly like a drum and bugle corpsman
the gun zips and flashes around as he whirls in place then freezes
the butt of the rifle to his shoulder he peers down the scope at his own head reflected in the mirror
he is sweating and breathing but the barrel does not move
youre dead motherfucker
electra leans out over the railing smiling inhaling the warm air the scent of the shimmering blue green sea
rath stands in the shadow of the door frame
why dont you bring it out here
its beautiful out here
rath steps a little farther out
he looks down either side of the building checking sight lines
he looks out and sees another hotel with windows facing them
he turns to her
moves back inside
the breakfast trays are empty
rath is sipping coffee scribbling notes and diagrams on a piece of paper
electra comes out of the bathroom dressed for the beach
he stops working
i know what you are thinking
im not going to disappear okay
im not going anywhere just down there to that beautiful beach
i got to get out of this room just for a little while
he wont be looking for you
just be careful
buy a book
keep your sunglasses on
electra steps out of the hotel room ready for the beach
at the end of the hall she sees the newlywed couple get on the elevator
she starts to call to them to hold it for her but she stops herself
the elevator closes
she edges slowly down the hall stopping outside the door to their suite
she touches it with the tips of her fingers
rath is still at the table
the curtain begins to billow a soft breeze blowing through the open patio door
they swell open and fall
it seems for a moment that there is a figure a shadow in the changing shape of the curtain
he walks to the open door
standing in the frame he looks out at the blue ocean below
he slides the door closed and the curtains fall still
bain moves through the market booths lining the edges of the plaza
his eyes shift rapidly behind his sunglasses
he buys an apricot and strolls into the center of the plaza
he looks at the bank at the military style security guards that patrol the front
he turns in the plaza checking the perimeter his gaze falling on the tall burned out building
he looks back at the bank imagining the sight line
he bites into the apricot its juice gushing running down his chin
rath is leaning back in the bed nikita purring in his lap
he did not sleep last night and is very tired
his eyes fight to stay open
the sound of the television momentarily hangs in the hotel room as he sleeps
the program is a spanish dubbed version of goldfinger
the door bangs open and rath springs off the bed a gun flashing in his hand leveling it at a dazed blinking electra
rath sighs slowly letting the hammer of the gun click back into place
you should knock
how was the beach
it was nice
the sun burns a tropical red against the mirrored windows of the hotel
electra is sitting on the bed her back against the wall
in her hands is a paperback romance novel that she is looking over the top of staring intensely across the room
we can hear rath his breathing deep and even
he is doing tai chi wearing only his boxer shorts
his body is coated in a sheen of sweat his muscles strained as he moves fluidly through space
electra begins to breath with him
she moves her body slightly her hips rising as though to meet his
he empties his lungs entirely in one exhale and stops his eyes closed rested
that was beautiful
he looks at her
tai chi right
where did you learn it
not that i would know but you look like youre really good at it
ive always wanted to learn something like that
its very important that the body release the energy that builds in it
electra nods watching him bend reaching for a change of clothes
im going to shower
if youre hungry go ahead and order some dinner
electra nods again
bain is doing push ups
he is naked except for his camouflage bikinis
he has his feet up on a chair making it harder the dip deeper
his body is gushing sweat his face a burning red
he is like a piston firing up and down
the muscles in his neck and shoulders are bulging cords
slowly his arm begin to tire the strain seen in his knotting and twisting expression
half way up he collapses feet falling off the chair
he rolls onto his back rubbing a tricep
he licks the sweat off his upper lip and smiles
rath checks his watch
its after eight oclock
he lifts the phone and plugs it into the modem
im going to call
electra drops her book and climbs off the bed
he dials types the code and waits
paid in full
oh my god
ten million dollars
transferred to the specified account
rath stares at the screen
the phone hums
electra picks it up placing it back in the cradle
he opens a case and pulls out his gun some paper and pens and two small mikes that look like hearing aids
okay he starts drawing several squares on the paper as electra picks up the mike
she looks over it frowns
transmits and receives
cheap as shit
he looks at her
i paid a lot for these
they saw you coming a mile away
if i had known wed be using its too late now
well have to deal with these
he goes back to his drawing
this is the bank
this is the hotel
in the morning i will enter the bank
he will be hidden somewhere out here probably somewhere low in the crowd
hell stay there until he sees me enter the bank
but he wont shoot you right then
it would be amateur
hell wait for the prime shot that he knows is coming
once im inside hell move to the hotel
hell go up the back too much traffic in the front
he draws another square
youll be here
a public place far enough away that he wont notice you but with a good enough view youll be able to see him when he moves inside
then we wait
i dont know if i like this plan
it will take the entire day but he will begin to doubt himself
he will begin to believe that he missed me that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe
he describes this as though remembering it
the sun will be low almost dark the air cool and the bank will almost be closed
he will put the rifle down he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank
why wont he wait until the bank closes
he wont be able to
hell have to go inside
hell have to see with his own eyes whether or not i am there
if the bank closes he wont know for sure
and when he does youll go into the hotel go upstairs and take the gun
what if he brings it with him
he shakes his head
the bank has an expensive security system metal detectors and x ray machines
that means you wont have a gun
and with the mikes ill tell you when he leaves the hotel and youll tell me when he leaves the bank
if things go well i dont have to
youll already be in a rented car waiting for me
youll have the money
how do i know that you wont ill be walking out of the bank unarmed
youll have the gun and ill drive the car
we split the money
five million apiece
you get on your plane i get on mine
sounds pretty well figured out
ive been thinking about it for a long time
except if he doesnt come out of the hotel
i told you he will
you cant know for sure how can you
i mean youre not him
she waits for him to explain
ten years ago i sat there in that same hotel window sweat pouring off of me waiting for nicholai
you killed him here
in this city outside that bank
what is it
i dont like this at all
what is going on here
i dont know
it just happened
i was here ten years ago im here now
i dont believe that
it wasnt planned or premeditated
things happened beyond my control
i understood i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense
ten years ago
i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank
he was sitting there very calm waiting for me
what did he want
he wanted what i want now to get out of the business
to disappear to some empty greek island
what did he say
he said i couldnt win
that no one wins at this game
was that it
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business
you didnt take it
i went back to the hotel
ten years later here you are again
here i am again
the cross hairs of a telescopic sight are lined up on the head of a marble statue
bain is laying on the floor in the dark
the rifle is under him as he aims out of his balcony down the street at the statue
he looks up from the scope checking the street
it is dark and empty and he shifts back looking into the sight
his finger squeezes the gun almost silent as a chunk of stone explodes out the head of the statue
again the gun spits and another cloud of dust and rock bursts from the head
his finger is pumping the trigger until the head cracks and falls
hes laughing hysterical looking down the street at the headless statue
he rolls onto his side still laughing
then suddenly he stops staring up at the stars in the night sky
electra is still at the table staring at the diagrams in another world
rath pours a glass of bourbon and sets it in front of her
this has been the longest day of my life
rath nods pouring himself a drink
electra looks at the drink downs the whole glass
he refills it
do you have ulcers
i think i got one today
five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids
they both gulp down their drinks and he fills them again
what do you suppose hes doing now
he is no longer looking at her staring at the board moving his mind into the chess game
she watches him and then begins to study it with him the way a child does almost imitating him
she does not want to be left alone right now
she reaches over and moves a white knight
his eyes shifting sorting the possibilities
he picks a bishop and counters
after another sequence he takes her bishop and she takes his knight
why did you trade a bishop for a knight
i hate bishops
i like knights
theyre worth less points
there is no point in arguing
as they continue to play we begin to hear in the distance the couple in the adjoining suite making very vigorous love
electra watches rath to see if he hears them
he shows no sign of it concentrating on the game
do you hear them
he looks up
he hears it
did you think they were newlyweds
i didnt notice them
when i first saw them i thought they were married
how do you know theyre not
i went into their room this afternoon
it was no big deal
i saw them leave i went in
jesus if someone had nobody ever sees me
why in the hell would you take that chance
i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them
i wanted to so i did
rath shakes his head
in the b
the woman is almost she is married but not to him
another man much older
she has four kids
the young guy works for her
and i think she likes kinky sex
isnt it interesting though
i mean look at us in this room
or yesterday when we were walking in the plaza market
i mean we look like just another couple
but what are we
doesnt it seem so crazy
its always been that way
the world has always functioned on two levels
it makes me crazy
i dont know
when i was in college i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor
and you were drilling these holes
so i could watch the girl that lived under me
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self preservation
did he explain how this happened
he believed it all went back to one night when as a little girl
i watched my parents have this big fight really big
i thought my mother was going to kill my father
then they went into their room and made up
and i watched them make love through the keyhole
the woman screams a final time in climax
electra moves her queen taking his other knight
what are you doing
thats a ridiculous move
because ill take it
im playing white remember
you cant tell me which pieces to move
it doesnt work that way
he shrugs and takes her queen the game continuing
can i ask you something
im sure you will
am i attractive
this gets his attention
are you attracted to me
i dont know
is it a physical thing or a mental thing
a good answer
is that why you didnt want to talk about women before
i didnt want to complicate the situation
attraction is a complication
it can be
it happened to you before
who was she
someone like me like you
what happened to her
she was taken
did you no
i tried to stop it
was she the only one
after her i realized that to survive i had to live without
its dangerous to let things become complicated
is this becoming complicated
im not sure that i care anymore
he looks up from the game
were you attracted to me right away
when did it start
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me
maybe you should see a psychiatrist
that doesnt sound normal
im not normal
thats why im attracted to you
i mean you make me nervous
maybe its my curiosity self preservation thing but all i can really think about right now is kissing you
they rise up from the table together knocking over the chess game
the pieces fall to the floor
they grab at each other kissing both of them hungry aggressive
they tear at each others clothes and at their own clothes it has a very awkward sense to it as they become naked in front of each other
there is nothing smooth or fluid about it which makes it seem very real
he takes her lifting her onto the table
she scoots and wiggles back the chess pieces falling out of the way
she opens her legs and he moves in between them
i wanted to tell you her breath rushes out then back in
my real name is anna
her legs wrap up around his hips and he pushes deeper into her
nice to meet you martin
outside of the room we can hear the muffled sounds of two we are moving down the street low over the old flagstones towards the marble statue that bain shot
on the ground are the shattered pieces of the head
we see one of the pieces is part of the face the eyes which seem like the iris less eyes of a chess king
we move into the blank white of that eye
we pull back rising up and away and see other squares black and white like a chess board
a womans high heels click past
rising higher we see the woman walking
a man crosses behind her in another direction
higher still and we realize that we are looking at the black and white marble floor of the it is a strange and beautiful bank
the ceilings are vast the suspended lights elaborate baroque the enormous clock on the wall built to resemble a sun
it looks almost as though it could be a museum with its massive oil paintings and bronze statues of important mexican figures
already it is crowded people and security guards moving about beneath us
rath steps onto the checkered floor and remembers
the cafe is off the plaza
electra sits at a patio table
down the street she can see the back of the burned out hotel
she hears rath in her ear piece
im in the bank
hell move now
how are you doing
she is nervous
rath is wearing a well tailored gray silk suit and dark sunglasses
in his hand is a very large briefcase
he crosses the checkered floor to the teller windows
may i help you
could you check on a transfer for me
your name or account
electra smiles when she hears him mouthing the name martin
a bank official walks over to the window carrying a printed receipt with a very bright smile
senor rath we have received your transfer
he hands rath the receipt
he glances at it checking the zeros
there are seven of them
now ill need to close this account
id like you to ready the paperwork
the smile fades
you wish to close this account today
how would you like the funds
this will take some time
i have all day
electra looks up over her book and bain is there moving down the side street gliding through the crowd with the menacing indifference of a shark
the official is talking to the teller in spanish when electra whispers in raths ear
electra watches as bain moves along the plywood wall covered with bills and posters built to keep people out of the burned hotel
he is carrying a long nylon duffel bag
at the corner a section of the plywood has been pulled loose and bain squeezes through into the hotel
rath is sitting in one of the high backed leather chairs set in pairs along the wall of the bank
he glances at the enormous clock which reads
he checks his rolex
now we wait
the center of the hotel is open
interior hall balconies which line each floor look down onto an old atrium courtyard
the fire did the most damage here spreading easily throughout the entire building
the skylight and ceiling at the top of this open area has been destroyed and sunlight streams through throwing broken patterns of shadow and light onto the blackened floors and
bain enters and carefully begins climbing the charred staircase to the fifth floor
the room has been heavily burned stained black from smoke
the charred carpet crunches and cracks as bain walks across it to the window
as he nears the exterior wall several floor boards break with a brittle snap and he almost falls through
he pulls his leg free
outside the window across the plaza he sees the bank a perfect site
quickly he unzips the bag and lifts out the gun
he grabs a magazine and snaps it into place
he aims down at the banks bright white stairs
a man is walking down the steps and bain finds the center of his forehead in the cross hairs of the scope
bain makes a gun noise followed by the sound of a head bursting open
leaning against the wall in the shadows of the window the gun in his lap he waits
time slows to a crawl
without taking his eye from the bank bain rummages through his bag and finds a pack of cigarettes
he pulls one out with his lips and lights it
taking a deep drag he lets the smoke slowly leak out and drift up into the night
there are five cigarette butts ground into the blackened window sill where bain extinguishes another
what in the fuck are you doing in there
the room is hot a streak of sweat up his back and front
it is difficult to breathe
a man walks out of the bank wearing a suit similar to raths
bains body snaps erect rifle instantly leveled
he sights the mans head his finger tightening on the trigger but he is not sure it is rath
he looks over the scope looks back
the man reaches the bottom of the stairs
bains body sags
thats not him
jesus bain baby chill the fuck out
he takes a deep breath and wipes the sweat from his forehead leaving a smear of black from the charcoal wood
he again fumbles through his bag finding a container of bottled water
he chugs the whole thing
the official walks over to rath with a number of papers to sign
your signature senor
everything is ready
rath signs them but does not get up
if you could follow me
im sorry but i am waiting for an associate
can you hold everything for me until he arrives
of course senor
electra is sipping at some iced tea dizzy at the thought of all that money
ten million dollars sitting there
this is insane
there is a faint smile on raths lips
the shadows are getting longer
bain is rocking back and forth breathing through his teeth
he has to urinate
he is checking every face that comes out of the bank with the scope
this is fucking insane
he grabs the empty plastic bottle unzips his pants and begins refilling it
a man in a suit appears on the steps and bain fumbles the bottle spilling it as he lifts the gun
it is not rath
fucking god dammit
he hurls the bottle of piss across the room
the sun clock on the wall perfectly still reads
after a long beat a single minute clicks off
the sun is getting low
the room much darker now
bain sits at the window his body a knot
a large group of tourists flow out of the bank and bains eyes light up
one by one the scope passes over each face
they trickle down the steps and into the plaza
the stairs are again empty
bain screams pounding the butt of the gun down splitting open the floor
he looks at the bank
he checks his watch
in fifteen minutes the bank will close
he stands up
electra is watching the back of the hotel when bain emerges from the shadows
oh my god
he is moving like a bullet knocking into people who dont get out of his way
rath looks up at the clock smiles
i waited another four minutes
wait until he is on the stairs
im taking off my mike
last night electra smiles
she sees bain storming up the stairs
she stands tosses several bills on the table and leaves
bain charges into the bank tearing off his sunglasses scanning the room
his face is a twisted grimace streaked with black charcoal
his body and clothes are covered in sweat and large salt rings
his breathing labored
he sees rath sitting comfortably calm his suit not even wrinkled and realizes that rath has been waiting for him
his first instinct is to turn and run but he stops himself
he is confused unsure
then as though understanding he has no choice he puts his sunglasses back on and strides over to rath boots clicking against the polished marble
bain sits down in the leather chair across from him
howd you know
just tell me that
howd you fucking know
i knew the same way in ten years youre going to know
what does that fucking mean
it means that im going to tell you things even though i already know that youre not going to listen to a god damned thing i say
electra carefully moves up to the fifth floor then navigates around a large hole towards the last room
thats what it is
but the real irony is that you wont know its irony until youre sitting over here
bain isnt listening
instead hes watching everyone who walks near them
when you walked in here and you saw me sitting here waiting the first thing that went through your head was that you were a dead man
this catches bains ear
youre thinking that youve been sold out
thats the only way i could know you were out there
why would you think this
because you dont trust your contractor
you dont trust anyone
its the first and last commandment
its the only thing that keeps you alive
so try as i might to tell you the truth you cant believe me
do you see the irony of the situation
its kind of funny isnt it
bain is not laughing
inside the burned out closet electra finds bains nylon duffel bag
digging through it she finds his gameboy his walkman his
ammunition clips and several issues of soldier of fortune and a punisher comic book
the rifle is not here
listen to me bain
two days ago you contacted your contractor who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell
you dont know how they got the information
it bothered you but you didnt care
how do i know this
because ten years ago i was sitting in that chair as scared shitless as you are now
i aint scared of you
yeah you are and you hate it
you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isnt
that youre sweating your balls off and im not
youve got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid all because of me
if you think you can take me quit fucking bullshitting and try it
all right bain
pay attention because this is where everything changes
electra is beginning to panic
she cannot find the gun and has started looking in other rooms
youre a businessman right
this is a business deal
behind that counter i have over ten million dollars
ill give you half of it more money than youll make in the next ten years if you walk away
bains face changes muscles relaxing the tension slipping out of him
five million dollars
that sure is a lot of money
bain is smiling
did you see how i did that
magic wasnt it
you understand whats going on
it makes sense right
what i just said no assassin would say
what ive said only a mark would say
they stare at each other
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars
you would be
you dont know a fucking thing about me
you dont have the slightest fucking clue
why dont you tell me
ill tell you this
after cleveland i thought i was lucky to be alive
but now here i just realized that you were the lucky one
now ill tell you something
it wouldnt fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars
youd still be thinking the same thing that youre going to take me
and here i am sitting through this knowing its bullshit looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind the only thing i can think is that
in just a few minutes im going to take you
bain jumps out of the seat
lets fucking go
hes walking turning watching everything everyone
hes out the door
electra is on the fourth level searching desperately for the gun rushing through the black skeletal remains of the hotel
in her ear she hears rath
rath is at the counter as the official loads perfectly stacked blocks of crisp one hundred dollar bills into the case
electra is frantic
god i cant find it
i cant find it
i cant find the fucking gun
for rath everything has changed
in long pounding strides bain crosses the square twisting glancing back watching
electra nears the room below the fifth story window
it wasnt with his other stuff
rath is now afraid
electra get out
bain nears the opening in the plywood wall
electra looks up and there is the gun supported by black plumbing pipe and charred lathe
it hangs in the space between two joists hidden in the upstairs floor
hes coming electra
get out now
i see it
she reaches for it but its too high
you have got to come to the bank for the money
she is not listening she is rushing down the hall back toward the stairs
just as she grabs the rail she hears bain storming into the lobby below
she begins climbing the stairs quickly but quietly
bain is a rampaging beast lunging up the stairs
the bank is almost empty
rath has begun to sweat
the official looks at him strangely stacking the last of the green paper blocks
electra peeks over the rail to see bain right behind her
the voice screams in her ear and she tears the mike off stuffing it in her pocket
electra whats happening
what are you the official closes the case and snaps the clasps shut
electra turns into the hotel room just as bain reaches the fifth floor
there is no time
she slips into the closet as bain whips around the corner into the room
he rushes to the window slamming himself against it
youre gonna take me
come on motherfucker
he bends down and from the hole that he fell into pulls out the assault rifle
take this you fuck
electra watches through the slits of the blackened wood lathe
he pounds his fist rapidly into his thigh and then through the wall
he stands suddenly perfectly still gun aimed at the bank
comeon comeon comeone itsover gameover comeon
the sun clock reads six oclock
there is no one left in the bank except for employees and guards
the official is at raths elbow leading him towards the metal gates
we are closed senor
thank you for banking with us
it is happening as it happened ten years ago
rath knows that he is unable to stop it
bain is rigid cast in iron the rifle rammed under his chin sight tight to his eye finger wrapped around the trigger
electra silently ever so delicately opens her bag lifting out her gun
make me shit you sorry ass piece of mark meat
come on come on
i know it
you know it
we know it
we watch rath step out of the bank the doors closing behind him
electra slowly rises still watching bain
the sun has begun to set and the entire plaza has a deep orange and auburn cast
rath looks down at the descending white stone steps
he steps down to the first stair
lift your head motherfucker
electra is standing
the gun clenched in her shaking hand
look up here
the cross hairs are an x on raths head
look at me
i want to see your face
rath looks across the square up the side of the hotel at the window there is only black shadow
he knows it is over
electra shoves open the door leveling the gun as bain turns
wha she fires
his shoulder explodes blood spraying the black wall
rath hears bain scream
his eyes his whole body comes to life
bain is twisting in mid air diving as she fires again moving at him
a chunk of wood explodes as she misses
he falls the burned floor shattering charred joists shearing with the sound of breaking glass
she watches him fall through hears him hit the floor below ash and wood clattering around him
the gun trained on the hole she peers over the edge but he is gone
rath races wildly across the darkening market square
bain lying on his back aims the rifle at her footsteps
he fires finger pumping bullets erupting through the floor around her feet
screaming she leaps out of the room into the hall
his shoulders oozing blood bain clenches his teeth and rises listening as she sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall
beneath he moves to the railing and aims at the staircase waiting until electra freezes at the top of the stairs realizing that they are exposed
she flashes her head quickly dipping back as the wall is perforated with bullets
god damn bitch
what are you doing
i dont believe this is happening
she can hear him coming his voice echoing through the hollow building
she looks down the stairs the hall above there is nowhere to go
youre fucking dead
im going to kill you a hundred fucking times for this
bain fires up at the ceiling the bullet tearing through the floor whizzing past electras head
if she moves hell know her position
he fires another
electra sinks down her back against the wall and aims at the floor
she fires back
bain closes as they both start firing silenced weapons flashing pumping lead at unseen targets
her gun empties first
he laughs hearing the click
game over bitch
raths scream echoes up through the building
before bain can target him rath is gone a shadow a ghost
he scans the hotels courtyard
the last light from the setting sun slips through the slits cracks and broken window panes casting patterns a surreal dream like grid resembling a chess board
electra sees her chance
she leaps to her feet throwing the gun over the balcony
the two men watch the gun clatter to the floor as she races back to the room
rath grabs the gun tracking bain hurling up the stairs to the fifth floor
rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun is empty
bain reaches the top of the stairs before electra gets to the end of the hall
rath sees it all happening
bain snaps into a targeting stance
electra is flying toward the door her feet hardly touching the floor when the cross hairs find her back
time becomes syrup
the blackened door jamb splinter bursts in front of her
she bounces scrambling on all fours into the room
bain hurries down the hall after her as rath bolts for the stairs
seeing rath exposed on the stairs bain whips around and fires the wall shredding behind rath as he dives back down into the shadows
ripping open bains duffel bag electra grabs bains
bain advances steadily the rifle trained on the door
inside the room electra grunts hurling the duffel bag out the door
it spins over the balcony and plummets to the ground and bursts open
a gun clip skitters across the stone tile coming to rest in the middle of the courtyard
rath and bain both see it
staying hidden rath immediately circles towards it
bain sweats looking at the door down at the clip then back at the door
somethings got to give
unsure what to do electra waits the gun clenched between her two hands covering the empty dark space of the door
bain makes his choice moving towards room
rath sees that bain is going after electra
he takes a slow breath and tears from the shadows bolting into the open rath is focused wholly on the clip the ground a blur beneath him bain reacts the
rifle swings rushing arcing after rath
two more steps and rath dives sliding snagging the clip as the rifle spits rath screams his leg erupting with blood
the scope glides up zeroing the back of raths head
rath rams the clip in place
game bain squeezes the trigger click the rifle is empty
bain screams in disbelief
rolling over rath jacks back the slide and sights the balcony but bain is gone
electra searches the room for a way out
keeping the gun trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole that bain fell through
grimacing rath struggles to his feet
bain explodes through the wall charred wood and plaster flying
electra spins to shoot but the floor suddenly cracks open swallowing her
limping lurching up the stairs rath hears the crash
jarred by the fall electra drags herself away from the open ceiling
he needs the gun
get rid of it
she looks up for bain but he has again disappeared
she looks at the gun thinking turning it over in her hands
his leg soaked with blood rath rumbles down the hall
black with soot bain descends soundless serpent like to the fourth level through another burned opening
electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound at every dark corner
she is almost there when we see bain a shadow coming to life emerging behind her
lumbering rath is halfway there his eyes riveted on the door to room
hearing bain electra turns
in one smooth motion he snatches her arm and breaks her wrist
the gun falls
rath hears her scream
electra kicks at his groin but he drops leg sweeping her to the ground
she gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face jack knifing her body back knocking her unconscious
bain grabs the gun
rath whips into the room blasting bullets chasing bain as he disappears into a blackened hole
rath goes to electra not knowing if she is alive or dead
gently he turns her cradling her head her face smeared with blood
from within the labyrinth rath hears bain begin to laugh
tell me something bobby boy
electra comes to her eyes blinking open
are you still thinking that youre going to take me
electra is trying to focus as rath listens to the voice searching the shadows but the voice seems to come from everywhere
no i dont think you are
you know what i think
the voice is closer
rath wipes the stinging sweat from his eyes
i think youre thinking what im thinking
still dizzy electra taps her fist against raths chest
you know what im thinking bobby boy
it seems as though bain is in the room
you know what im thinking
electra opens her fist and inside rath sees the handful of bullets from the other gun
bain whirls into view his gun whipping around to rath who turns too slow
bain pumps the trigger
the gun is empty
yeah i know what youre thinking
he levels his gun
rath fires over and over emptying the gun into bains head and chest even as he crashes through the balcony railing and falls twisting through lightless space slamming to the
stone floor dead
the sun is gone the market is closing the crowd drifting from the plaza
a man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley beside the boarded hotel
although they walk a bit slow leaning on one another they become it seems like just another couple arm in arm holding tightly to each other and to a very
