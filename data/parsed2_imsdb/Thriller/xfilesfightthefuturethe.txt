the x files production draft by chris carter a blinding white screen under which we hear an ominous low end dolby thx big screen rumble
were not in television land anymore toto
as the rumble builds two black figures appear on what now has resolved into a distant horizon
from their movements we can shortly see that the figures are men
moving along a windswept ice sheet in an otherwise featureless land
a legend appears north texas b
continuing toward us we can now see that they are dressed in crude garments made of animal skins
if we squint we can see their hair is long their jutting foreheads significant of primitive homo sapiens
they continue toward us the wind beating against them camera is craning down to the snow that lies before them
to large three toed tracks
as they track the three toed prints to a rocky crevice in the hard pack ice
the prints stop here and so do the men
dropping down into the crevice in pursuit of their quarry
dark in here except where the sunlight penetrates the thick glassy ice walls
the silhouettes of the primitives stark against the glistening cavern
the sound of flint being struck then a torch catches fire illuminating their faces
and deeper in the cave
fleeing the light and the men
we get only a brief glimpse of it in the torch light seeing that it moves upright on two legs and has gray dinosaur like skin
and large black eyes
but it moves quickly enough away that any other identifying feature is lost in the deeper shadows
removing crude weapons made of sharpened bone from under their thick fur garments and scrabbling into the constricting cavern giving chase
following them as they moves with animal like agility through the tightening space
their torchlight catching as it disappears into a tight opening in a smaller crevice leading off the main one
the primitives entering frame after a moment only a few steps behind
the lead primitive dropping to the cave floor pulling himself into this same tight fissure in pursuit
splitting off from his partner who exits frame still on the run
the fiery torch comes through first held by the lead man
throwing dancing shadows on the walls of what appears to be a box cavern
rising quickly to his feet
not seeing what the torch illuminates just behind him the face of a dead primitive man his body frozen into the ice
he does finally notice this turning to see it when hes the torch falls to the floor so that the fight is difficult to see but it is loud and
the creature squealing wildly as the grunts of the primitive now turn to the sounds of painful struggle
until suddenly appears driving his bone weapon into the body of the creature
again and again until the creature is driven away into the shadows
the second man grabs the torch now not to see if his hunting mate has survived but in pursuit of the creature
in the light we see that he and his weapon are covered with spatters of oily black blood
as is the first primitive whose body lies heaving on the floor
the second primitive stepping over his hunting mate stalking the creature into the shadows where it has collapsed
the torch finally landing for the first time on its face
when the torchlight hits its face the creature attacks
but the primitive prevails
he drops his torch and dispatches the already wounded creature with strong hard stabs of his weapon one of which penetrates the creatures eye
the torch which lies on the ground illuminates the dead creatures face
its wounds are flowing with the oily black blood which oddly now begins to pool
as if it has intelligence sentience
pooling and traveling into a fissure in the cave floor
watching this unknowing
his chest heaving from the fight as the spots of oily black blood which have spattered onto him begin to crawl
crawling toward his eyes and mouth
causing him to let out grunts of fear
which are the sounds we hear as the camera slowly cranes up past the struggling primitive to the roof of the cave where the dancing shadows of the torch fade
away with the sounds of struggle
moving into darkness and silence
but only for a moment
until along with the spade of a shovel
and then the earthen cave ceiling gives way and a boy wearing nikes and an old t shirt falls through it
falling past camera
we hear a yell then a thud and a clattering of the shovel thats fallen in with him
then a pained then several heads appear in the opening
these are boys of ten to eleven staring down into the cave
hot sunlight blazing in
we have traveled far far forward in time
on the floor below covered with dirt in his nose and mouth
all these boys have texas in their voices
straining the wind knocked out of me
this draws no sympathy from above only laughter
looks like a cave or something
whats down there stevie
stevie has gotten up moving out of the patch of sunlight
disappearing from view for a moment
then reappearing still spitting out dirt
but holding human skull
one side partially missing from the cranium
but it brings whoops of delight from the boys above
toss it up here dude
no way buttwipe
i found it
the other boys looking down at him
stevie looking at the skull
strangely the light shines through it
it is milky opaque as if its bone thats turned somehow glassy in places
then anyways theres bones all over the place down here
stevie looks down at his feet
camera following his look down to where there are indeed more human bones
and something else
he takes a couple of steps in place standing in a familiar black oily substance which is climbing up his tennis shoe from the rock floor over the edge of
the shoe and down into the shoe itself
then the skull drops in the frame clattering on the hard floor of the cave
following subcutaneous worms which have begun locomoting aggressively up his legs
as his whole body is wracked by a shivering seizure of some kind
camera rises following the path of the worms as they move up the legs of his shorts
some appearing on his bare arms but the great majority continuing up to stevies neck toward his face
stevie stands paralyzed
letting out guttural sounds not dissimilar to when the wind was knocked out of him
but stevie cannot answer him
camera continuing up to the boys above
looking down at their friend
their eyes go wide
but what they see next answers that question for them
his face suddenly alive with the subcutaneous worms
moving toward his eyes which begin filling with black oil
looking much now like alien eyes
freaked by what they see
and doing what any kid would do now
lets get outta here
and they do
bolting from the hole in the top of the cave
camera pushing up through this hole to reveal we are in a dirt hole that was being dug by the three kids
rising up out of the hole to reveal the parched dirt patch where three kids are running away from us as fast as their feet will take them
toward a new housing tract five floorplans to choose from including the model home
disappearing into the neighborhood
a legend appears north texas
camera continues rising above the rooftops to see the surrounding expanse of empty texas flatland
and in the distance the dallas skyline
as camera settles there are a few moments of nothing but the sound of the wind gently whistling across the landscape
in which we bury a short time cut
then we hear it before we see it fire engines pulling into the neighborhood sirens wailing
camera dropping again as the lead engine pulls up
firemen are hopping off moving to the hole the boys dug
two firemen carrying a ladder clamber down past camera three others appearing on their heels
the other two firemen clamber down too
the captain at the edge of the hole watching them
holding a radio
this is captain miles cooles
weve got a rescue situation in progress
as the lead fireman steps down the ladder into the cave
he scans the darkness illuminated only by the shaft of light permitted by the hole above
as the nd fireman drops down next to him
the both stand motionless now as if sensing something
stevies feet are just visible on the floor of the cave a short distance away
they start cautiously toward stevie
camera finding their feet
tracking through the same oily black substance we saw bleeding from the creature thirty five thousand years ago
as they move into the shadows we hold on the substance
and see it move
camera rises out of the dirt hole finds a group of concerned parents kids including stevies friends
theyre held at a distance by the remaining firemen
everyone turning their concerned gazes skyward
looking at coming off the sun setting horizon
moving toward us at high speed
the whop whop of its blade soon shaking the neighborhood as it banks in and around and hovers just over the dirt field
landing gently on the parched hard scrabble
the side door flies open and five haz mat rescue paramedics jump out carrying a bubble litter
camera pans them to the dirt hole past the fire captain
the haz mat paramedics moving down into the hole
the fire captain watches this then stares toward dr
ben bronschweig in shirtsleeves tie exiting the chopper following up the rear
the captain meeting him in route
over the chopper keep those people back
get them out of here
to his men move them all back
dogging bronschweig i sent four men down after the boy
theyre not responding
bronschweigs focus is elsewhere though
hes making a bee line to the earthen hole where young stevie is being pulled out and lifted into an enclosed quarantine bubble litter by the rescue squad
bronschweig watches with great concern
getting a good look now at stevies paralyzed body as it passes him
as stevies body is loaded aboard the side door is slid shut
the engine throttles up and the chopper takes flight again almost as quickly as it arrived
the prop wash blowing and the gathering crowd
bronschweig watches the chopper bank away then turns his look to where a series of unmarked cargo vans trucks are rolling in
a fleet of vehicles driven by what looks like military personnel
most conspicuously two white unmarked tanker trucks
there are no markings on these vehicles
as the fire captain moves around to face him off
what about my men
brusquely were doing all we can
and he moves off toward the approaching trucks where the military personnel are pulling out tents tent poles scientific equipment
leaving the captain to wonder what the hells going on
watching the first of many refrigeration units being unloaded
the personnel carrying it paying him no mind as they blow past him
moving right to camera and plunging us into black
then over black a familiar sound again
the sound of a chopper auguring in
as we fade up revealing we are the chopper is banking over the side of the building preparing to touch down on the rooftop where fifteen fbi agents in dark
id windbreakers are standing
a legend appears federal building dallas texas
one week the chopper touches down and again the side door is thrown open
but now only one man exits special agent michaud moves with the measured pace of authority approaching the waiting fbi agents
one of whom steps up
weve evacuated the building and been through it bottom to top
no trace of an explosive device or anything resembling one
have you taken the dogs through
well take them through again
this is given as a non negotiable order to the somewhat weary fbi man
who turns back to his charges michaud does not register this attitude though
something else has caught his attention
causing him to walk to the edge of the building
camera following him seeing what he sees now
on an adjacent skyscraper is what appears to be an fbi agent in an id windbreaker exiting onto the roof
camera continuing around into a close up profile of s
staring at this his jaw set
he doesnt like what he sees
and what he sees is special agent dana scully is coming out the door leading onto the roof
the door slams shut behind her
she too is dressed in an fbi windbreaker
shes dialing her cell phone as she moves around the rooftop looking for something
dialing the number of mulder its me where are you scully
im on the roof
did you find something
whats wrong scully
ive just climbed twelve floors
im hot and thirsty and im wondering to be honest what im doing here
youre looking for a bomb
i know that
but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street
i think they have that covered
when a terrorist bomb threat is called in the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb
the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror
if youd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device
if we dont act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might
not find it
lives could be lost scully engrossed in her own argument realizes shes been the only one speaking for the last short while
she stops walking
what happened to playing a hunch
scully almost jumps out of her own skin
the voice has come not over the phone but from two feet away where standing in the shadow of a large air conditioning unit
cracking a trademark sunflower seed between his teeth
clicking his cell phone off
the element of surprise scully
random acts of unpredictability
if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be
programmed categorized or easily referenced
mulder has moved to the edge of the building where he sails his sunflower seeds into the air
dusting his hands off as if lost in a wistful through for just a moment
what are we doing up here
its hotter than hell
and hes on the move
scully moving to catch up
mulder is moving toward the stairs scully catching him
mulder allowing her to lead him up the steps
i know youre bored in this assignment but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now
youve got to quit looking for what isnt there
theyve closed the x files
theres procedure to be followed here
what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston
i think its free beer night at the astrodome
scully gives him a look
its no use
she reaches the door first grabs the knob but
it wont open
turning to mulder
suddenly nervous its locked
she wiggles the knob again
so much for anticipating the unforeseen
scully squints into the sun staring at mulder
but hes quick on the draw and realizes what shes up to
he grabs for the door and
looking to scully whose hard look of mock scolding has become a smirking smile
no you didnt
had you big time
and thats how it continues as they re enter the stairwell the door slamming shut behind them
as an elevator dings and the doors open
scully and mulder exit into the lobby where people move in and out
heads turn due to their fbi jackets
included atmosphere a group of kids on a field trip being led into an elevator by their teacher
i saw your face mulder
there was a moment of panic
have you ever seen me panic scully
i just did
mulder fishes for change but more out of sportsmanship
whatll it be coke pepsi
a saline iv
scully flashes a thin victory smile as mulder heads off
mulder moving to a door with a small shingle above it which says snacks beverages
as he approaches sorting through the change hes fished up the door opens and a man in a vendors uniform appears
he makes casual and ever so brief eye contact with mulder as he brushes past him
mulder making no note of this as he moves to catch the door before it closes
mulder takes a few steps down into the windowless room
moving past the snack machines to a lighted soda machine
finding the correct change and plunking it in
hitting a button but
nothing comes out
oh come on
he beats his fist a couple of times on the front of the machine
he finds more change
plunking it in
hits the button
he stares at the machine a minute then beats it hard with his fist
moving around to the back of the machine looking for mulders face peering in on the slim space between the machine and the wall
reaching down and lifting the plug on the end of the electrical cord
it isnt plugged in
realizing now why the machine hasnt spit out his sodas
as mulder appears stepping very lightly in front of the machine that he was just pounding away on
looking at it then moving quickly to the door he entered through
grasping the knob but finding it
he jiggles the knob pulls on it
but theres no two ways about it hes locked in
scully stands looking at her watch
wondering where mulder is
when her cell phone starts ringing
she answers it
scully i found the bomb
thinks hes joking where are you mulder
im in the vending room
scully is on the move but she doesnt believe him for a second
scully appears heard a pounding
following this noise to the door mulder is obviously on the other side of
tries the door
is that you pounding
mulder holds his phone to his ear using his other hand to pound
scully get somebody to open this door
nice try mulder
camera following mulder as he steps back revealing now that hes gotten the hinged front of the coke machine open
but we cant yet see whats inside
scully listen to me
its in the coke machine
youve got about fourteen minutes to get this building evacuated
scully is shaking her head
tries the door again
open the door
his response to this is more hard pounding
tell me this is a joke
thirteen fifty nine thirteen fifty eight thirteen fifty seven
as he is doing this scully is bending to see its been freshly soldered over
mulder stands pacing in front of wired with circuit boards electric belts and generally looking like it would take an expert a good long time to figure out where to
a lot longer than the that reads on the digital read out
thirteen fifty six
im gonna get you out of there
the line goes dead
and off mulders deepening anxiety we scully enters like general patton taking charge
barking at the security guards who sit behind their security console
i need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes
i need you to get on the phone and tell the fire department to block off the city center in one mile radius around the building in ten minutes
and shes moving dialing her cell phone now
into phone this is special agent dana scully
i need to speak to s
hes got the wrong building unmarked fbi vans cars are pulling up out front
agents in windbreakers are exiting moving at a run to the building
among them s
moving to exiting the building
behind her workers are beginning to stream out of the building as well as the young field trippers
michaud meeting up with scully mid plaza
as the windbreaker agents move past them entering the building
where is it
moving with them now back toward the building
as fire trucks are pulling up out in the street out front
suddenly this has the distinct feel of a situation veering out of control
mulder found it in a vending machine
hes locked in with it
the digital read out hits
pull back to reveal mulder staring at it
if he wasnt sweating enough on the roof hes certainly sweating now
when his cell phone rings
move away from the door
were coming through it
no sooner is this said than the camera whips off mulder to the door where a gas plasma torch flame is sizzling along the hinges
where michaud himself wearing a kevlar vest now is wielding the torch
expertly cutting the metal while scully and two agents and two dallas bomb squad men look on
in the b
building employees are streaming out
michaud finishes and shuts off the torch
the other agents kick the metal door in sending it crashing to the floor
mulder stands on the other side
watching michaud pick up a heft tool kit stepping over the downed door
scully right behind him
along with the agents bomb techs
as michaud steps in next to him sizing up the time on the ticking digital readout
and just exactly what kind of defusing work hes got cut out for him
tell me this is just soda pop in those canisters
its what it looks like
a big i
ten gallons of astrolite
studying the bomb okay get everybody out of here and clear the building
somebodys got to stay with you i gave you an order
now get the hell out of here and evacuate the area
can you defuse it
setting his tool kit down opening it
as the other agents heed his word exiting the room
i think so
youve got about four minutes to find out if youre wrong
michaud turns on him with unexpected intensity
did you hear what i said
lets go mulder
scully starts out
mulder stares at michaud for a moment but michauds focus is on the bomb now
he wont meet mulders look
finally mulder moves off following scully
camera holds on michaud just staring at the bomb
the last of the building occupants are being hauled off in city buses which have moved in curbside
as these buses pull away so do the fire trucks that have positioned themselves out front
and the police squad cars
as mulder and scully exit the front door
moving quickly until mulder hits mid plaza and slows
scully not realizing this for a few steps then turning
what are you doing
off his non response mulder one last windbreakered agent is exiting
moving past them to the last cop car other than the car waiting for mulder and scully
mulder has stopped and is looking back to the building now as scully hustles back the few steps separating them
as the last agent outs car zooms away
leaving only their car and the man driving it a windbreakered whats he doing
the plaza is desolate now void of life
somethings not right
get in the car
scully is pulling him now
pulling him toward the car and the obviously impatient windbreakered agent
theres no time
close on bomb
the seconds ticking off now as it passes the mark
camera pulling back adjusting to michaud
his tool chest is closed up and he is sitting on it improbably
still staring at the bomb then pulling his head down in what appears to be resignation
as the seconds tick away
mulder has relented now against his better instincts
moving with scully to the car faster as they go
the windbreaker agent standing in the open door of the drivers side
getting in behind the wheel
sitting motionless in front of the bomb as the seconds tick down
mulder and scully getting in the car
tracking backwards with them now as the agent driving pulls away getting only thirty maybe forty yards when the bomb detonates and the building explodes
and this is no fatwa symbolic little terror strike
this is oklahoma city
or do we say independence day
as all the windows blow out and the car is lifted up slamming into the corner of a parked car
the air so quickly full of debris that it would seem the whole city has been destroyed
as the debris starts to clear somewhat much of it still floating to the ground though
we see the fires raging on every floor
that most of the front of the building has been torn away and we can see right into many floors
where it sits half cocked against a parked car
the air is full of debris particulated matter
the rear door of the squad car opens now and mulder gets out covered with glass
moving to the front passenger door opening it for scully
with darkest irony next time youre buying
high above the u
capital the entire beltway
with a legend to establish
on the j
edgar hoover building fbi headquarters
descending low on the three sided monolith and its large interior courtyard
as another legend appears under in light of waco and ruby ridge
a formal hearing
several assistant directors sit at a head table going over documents
name placecards in front of them
panning the group the sound of papers shuffling the occasional clearing of a throat creating a stale air of importance under there is a heightened need at the attorney generals
office to place responsibility as early as possible
a no nonsense year old lawyer cum fbi agent
for the catastrophic destruction of public property and the loss of life due to terrorist activities
next to cassidy is assistant director walter skinner mulder and scullys former superior on the x files
looking ruefully at at a small table the chair next to her conspicuously empty
many details are still unclear some agents reports have not been filed or have come in sketchy without a satisfactory accounting of the events that led to the destruction in
but were under some pressure to give an accurate picture of what happened to the attorney general so she can issue a public statement
the door to the room opens behind scully now and mulder enters his manner that of a man who knows hes late to a function
she looks up at mulder and scully with a stern glare
we now know that five people died in the explosion
special agent in charge darius michaud who was trying to defuse the bomb that had been hidden in a vending machine
three firemen from dallas and a young boy
mulder pulls out his chair to sit down but remains standing
they trade a look
this is new news to them
excuse me the firemen and the boy they were in the building
agent mulder since you werent able to be on time for this hearing im going to ask you to step outside so that we can get agent scullys version of
so that she wont have to be paid the same disrespect
we were told the building was clear
youll get your turn agent mulder
please step out
mulder trades looks with who stares at him evenly but not unsympathetically
hes been here with mulder on many occasions
seen mulder run up against the bureau and its stiff conventions
always in the middle
it does say there in your paperwork that we were the ones who found the bomb
thank you agent mulder
well call you in shortly
as mulder slides his chair in
scully watching him exit
mulder sits by himself in a chair head down
when the door to the hearing room opens
mulder rising as a
sit down theyre still talking to agent scully
theyre asking her for a narrative
they want to know why she was in the wrong building
she was with me
skinner studies mulder shaking his head
you dont see whats going on here do you
off mulders look theres four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas
lives have been lost
no suspects have been named
so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented
that the fbi didnt do its job
and they want to blame us
agent mulder we both know that if you and agent scully hadnt taken the initiative to search the adjacent building you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred grasping
the irony but its not the lives we saved
its the lives we didnt
reciting the dictum if it looks bad its bad for the if they want someone to blame they can blame me
agent scully doesnt deserve this
shes in there right now saying the same thing about you
i breached protocol
i broke contact with the s
i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building
that you wanted to go back
mulder doesnt get to respond because the door opens again and agent scully exits
she looks like shes been through it
to skinner theyre asking for you sir
skinner gives one last look to mulder then re enters
leaving mulder and scully alone
scully wearing a pained look
whatever you told them in there you dont have to protect me
all i told them was the truth
theyre trying to divide us on this scully
we cant let them
they have divided us mulder
theyre splitting us up
what are you talking about
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment
i think you must have an idea
they cited a history of problems relating back to
they were the ones that put us together
because they wanted me to invalidate your work your investigations into the paranormal
but i think this goes deeper than that
this isnt about you scully
theyre doing this to me
theyre not doing this mulder
off his look i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi
when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau
i felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself
but it hasnt turned out that way
and now if i were to be transferred to omaha or wichita or some field office where im sure i could rise it just doesnt hold the interest for me
it once did
not after what ive seen and done
theres really no reason left for me to stay anymore
off his look maybe you should ask yourself if your hearts still in it too
the door opens to the hearing room again now
skinner steps part way out gesturing to him
regretfully im sorry
scully studying his poorly disguised hurt
before he turns and goes into the room
scully watching the door close behind him
her feelings poorly disguised too
close on a shooter of tequila being poured
camera adjusting to reveal the attractive barmaid tipping the bottle
pushing it across the bar to where two empty shooters sit making the exchange
id say this about exceeds your minimum daily requirement
the person shes talking to us he sits by himself on a stool staring down at the bar
staring at the shooter which he spins with his fingers
gotta train for this kind of heavy lifting
mulder tosses back the shooter anyway
she watches him as she retrieves the small shot glass intrigued by his dark silence
mulder shakes his head no work
mulder nods pointing to the tequila bottle again
the barmaid agrees to pour another one reluctantly
staring at mulder intently
hes older than mulder dressed in an old brooke brothers light summer suit
mulder notices him feels his gaze but doesnt give it thought
what do you do
what do i do
off her curious look im a key figure in an ongoing government charade
an annoyance to my superiors
a joke among my peers
spooky they call me
whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid
who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun shouting to the heavens and anyone wholl listen that the fix is in
that our governments hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy
that the sky is falling and when it hits its gonna be the shitstorm of all time
she stares at him for a moment startled by his drunken screed
she pulls back the shooter shes just poured mulder
i think that about does it spooky
why dont you go home to the old lady sorry
dont have one
mulder slides off his stool noticing the watchful man is gone
he feints toward the door then reverses direction
heads to the back of the place
mulder appears moving to the bathroom door
only to find an out of order sign on it
he moves to the womans room but its locked
gathering whats left of his wits mulder does what any red blooded man would do in this situation
he goes to the back door of the bar and exits into the alley
mulder has found a place against a wall between two dumpsters
jerking around in surprise at the sound of a that official fbi business
hes not far from mulder
his name is kurtzweil
bet the bureaus accusing you of the same thing in dallas
mulders weirded out as the stranger moves to him un threateningly
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding
kurtzweil enjoys a little laugh over this
do i know you
ive been watching your career for a good while
back when you were just a promising young agent before that
mulder stares at this man as he finishes zipping up
you follow me out here for a reason
yeah i did
kurtzweil unzips his own pants now
there is a moment one of those awkward moments where mulders not sure whats about to happen
but kurtzweils just relieving himself too
shuffling up to the wall mulder takes this as an opportunity to head back toward the bar
but kurtzweil hails him again
my names kurtzweil
i know the name
old friend of your fathers
kurtzweil continues peeing
knows this got mulders attention
back at the department of state
we were what you might call fellow travelers but his disenchantment outlasted mine
beat i never believed in the project
mulder stares at kurtzweil now
hes being toyed with
he turns opens the door into the bar
as kurtzweil gets a little louder
oh come on
dont pretend you dont know about the project
your father died for it
your sister was taken because of it
kurtzweil finishes natures call
heads after mulder
mulder is coming from the back
kurtzweil moving to catch up
and he does at the coat stand
the place has pretty much cleared out except for the barmaid and some help
howd you find me
heard you come here now and again
figured youd be needing a little drinky tonight
you a reporter
im a doctor but i think i mentioned that
who sent you
i came on my own
after reading about the bombing in dallas
well if youve got something to tell me youve got as long as it takes me to hail a cab
mulder starts out the door but kurtzweil grabs his arm
theyre going to pin dallas on you agent mulder
but there was nothing you couldve done
nothing anyone couldve done to prevent that bomb from going off
because the truth is something youd never have guessed never have predicted
mulder pulls away from kurtzweil but kurtzweil dogs him to the street is empty the hour is late
mulder moves to the curb
and whats that
darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb
rhetorical disbelief he just let it explode
whats the question nobodys asking
why that building
why not the federal building
the federal building was too well guarded
they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices
the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there
which is where the bodies were found
but thats the thing
mulders got his hand up for a taxi coming
its pulling over as mulder steps from the curb stepping away from kurtzweil
the thing you didnt know
that youd never think to check
mulders got the taxi door open turning to kurtzweil
those people were already dead
before the bomb went off
thats what im saying
mulder stares at kurtzweil for a moment
michaud was a twenty two year veteran of the bureau michaud was a patriot
the men hes loyal to know their way around dallas
they blew that building to hide something
maybe something even they couldnt predict
youre saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen
and one little boy
mulder gets in the cab closes the door
rolls down the window
i think youre full of shit
kurtzweil raps the top of the roof and steps away from the car
as the taxi takes off
we stay with kurtzweil watching mulders cab speed away
note this should also be covered from inside the cab with mulder to play the scene out on him
scully is in bed lying awake
staring at the ceiling
when she reacts to a pounding at her door
close on the front door
scully peeks in the peephole
then she removes the safety chain opening the door
strangely intense i wake you
its three am
scully gets a whiff of his breath
as he moves past her into the apartment
radiating a kind of manic intensity
are you drunk mulder
i was until about an hour ago
is that before or after you got the idea to come here
mulder looks at her curiously
what are you implying scully
frowning i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting
is that what youd like me to do
long enough to indicate her own wavering heart
go home mulder
get dressed scully
mulder what are you doing
just get dressed
ill explain on the way
the moon is rising over the horizon across the curvilinear distance of endless scrub and sagebrush
when flying objects cross between it and us their forms unidentifiable in the rising heat waves off the earth
but they are moving towards us silhouettes in the background of the moon
they move silently their size increasing as they move closer
and then we hear them moments before they arrive at our position unmarked helicopters just overhead
hugging the ground as they blast across the dark texas night
flying at dangerously low altitude over the almost featureless night landscape
heading for something that we see ahead in the distance
what looks like a large glowing dome surrounded by the lights of a residential area weve already seen on the edge of suburban dallas sprawl
the field where the kids had been digging has been transformed into some kind of worksite
a large white domed tent has been erected over almost the entire patch of ground surrounded by the cargo trucks that we saw earlier and more unmarked vans and trucks
there are men in black fatigues moving about and scientists in haz mat suits
as the unmarked black helicopters bank overhead
coming in for a landing in the glow cast from the tents
camera moving toward one of the helicopters as it lightly touches down and its black door swings open
a man stepping out and as camera pushes up into his face we recognize him as the cigarette smoking man
the figure that weve come to know as an assassin and a model of modern self interest and amorality
one of the central protagonists in the conspiracy to keep the truth from the american people about the existence of extraterrestrial life
something known only as the project
he walks out from under the whirring prop just far enough to get a flame from his lighter to get a cigarette lit
as we a scientist in a haz mat suit is moving through the maze of clear plastic tubing that divides work areas within the tent
areas where scientists are working at tables doing what appears to be some kind of high tech archeological work
it is a hive of activity within as the scientist leads us past the refrigeration units to the earthen hole where dr
bronschweig weve met him earlier coming out of a med evac chopper that landed when the tent city was erected appears out of the earthen hole which is reason for
all this excitement
climbing out a clear hatch which has been fashioned to cover the hole
seeing now suited up himself
bronschweig approaches him
youve got something to show me
nervous excitement yes
what we originally established as icy and what later became the unfrozen texas field where the boys discovered the human skull has been turned to its previously icy state
thanks to two large vents that dr
bronschweig is pointing at we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development which is nothing like weve ever seen
brought on by what
heat i think
the coincident invasion of a host the fireman and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six
they step over to a section of the cave which has been draped with more plastic the lights from inside this are giving off a cool blue light passing by
two portable drilling rigs which have been erected their pumps moving up and down like rocking horses
bronschweig pushes away the plastic revealing a man lying on a gurney draped in plastic
he is hooked up to various and sundry machines which are monitoring his life signs
his skin has turned almost translucent the veins and capillaries now clearly visible as is his pulse
his heartbeat sending life sustaining blood and energy through his body
this mans still alive
technically and biologically though hell never recover
the csm is shaking his head in nervous uneasy wonder
how can this be
the developing organism is using his life energy digesting bone and tissue
weve just slowed the process
bronschweig redirects a light so that it shines hard into the mans face and then we see it
though the mans eyes still blink occasionally we can actually see through his tissue and the bones in his skull to see something is living inside him
the cigarette smoking mans mind is working intently on all the possibilities and consequences
do you want me to destroy this one too
before it gestates
we need to try our vaccine on it
and if its unsuccessful
like the others
this mans family will want to see the body laid to rest
tell them he was trying to save the young boys life and that he died heroically like the other firemen
they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus
youll make sure the families are taken care of financially along with a sizeable donation to the community
beat maybe a small roadside memorial
he watches the csm exit then back to the prostrate fireman
there is more movement within his body
within his chest and neck as if the creature gestating inside is continuing to stretch and grow
so that now we can see one of its black eyes staring from through the clear flesh of the fireman
an eye which blinks at us
as we mulder and scully appear at the end of a long hall
moving toward camera where a young naval guard sits in f
as a legend appears to establish
mulder and scully moving the long distance to the guards station
where the guard looks up at them with military scrutiny
id and floor youre visiting
they both show their fbi ids
were going to the morgue
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel
on whose orders
mulder doesnt miss a beat
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here
we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately
i dont know anything about that
well call general mcaddie
i dont have his number
they can patch you in through the switchboard
the guard is nervous about this checking his watch
he picks up the phone going through a large directory
we dont have time to dick around here watching you demonstrate your ignorance in the chain of command
the order came direct from general mcaddie
well conduct our business while you confirm authorization
mulder is already directing scully past the naval guard who tentatively picks up the phone again
to their backs why dont you go on ahead head and ill confirm authorization
leading mulder and scully moving theyve pulled off a con
why is a morgue suddenly off limits on orders of a general
tracking table height across gurneys where white sheet wrapped bodies lie
camera landing on scully
standing next to mulder who is undoing the peculiar ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas
according to this tag
and youre looking for
i can tell you that without even looking at him
off mulders look conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris
scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet wrapped corpse
this body has already been autopsied mulder
you can tell from the way its been wrapped and dressed
undeterred mulder works to get the sheet off
the first thing we notice is that hes still in his firemans uniform
his face looks familiar to us not because we know him but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman
we will also notice hes missing an arm a leg and large part of his torso
does this fit the description you just read me scully
scully comes around reacting to what she sees
oh my god
this mans tissue
scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves stretching them on to palpate the mans tissue
its like jelly
theres some kind of cellular breakdown
its completely edematous
she palpates the spongy skin on the mans face neck
unbuttoning the uniform now seeing and theres been no autopsy performed
theres no y incision here no internal exam
youre telling me the cause of death on the report is false
that this man didnt die from an explosion or from flying debris
i dont know what killed this man
im not sure if anybody else could claim to either
off mulders reaction to this the gurney with the fireman is pushed through a pair of swinging doors into the darkened lab
scully flips the lights on looking around at the giant facility
pushing him you knew this man didnt die at the bomb site before we got here
id been told as much
youre saying the bombing was a cover up
i dont know
but i have a hunch what youre going to find here isnt anything that can be categorized or easily referenced
mulder this is going to take some time and somebodys going to figure out soon enough were not even supposed to be here
beat im in serious violation of medical ethics
were being blamed for these deaths
scully i want to know what this man died of
scully stares at mulder then back down at the body
how can she refuse given the finality and the personal appeal of the request
after a moments hesitation she turns to the body and to the tray table of tools nearby
resigned if not resolved
a legend appears washington d
the street is fairly empty save for a garbage truck picking up the stacks of green garbage bags laid out on the sidewalks
then a taxi turns off a main street over mulder to the street where the taxi is moving forward toward a spot where two arlington pd cruisers are pulled up
to the curb
mulder checks the address he has written down
to the cabbie i think this is it up here
the taxi pulls over and mulder exits starting up the steps of a walk up where the door is open
there are uniformed officers inside and a detective
mulder steps into an office
four pairs of eyes give him the once over
the detective stepping over to him
is this dr
suspiciously you got some kind of business with him
im looking for him
looking for him for what
mulder pulls out his id flashes it at the detective
to his partners feds are looking for him too
turns to mulder real nice business hes got huh
selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer
mulder nods though this is news to him
he steps in a little further noticing a shelf lined with books
their spines all have the authors name written large dr
mulder picks up one of these books with the title the you looking for him for some other reason
yeah i had an appointment for a pelvic examination
they stare at mulder like hes a sicko
he smiles and they break into raucous laughter
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil
mulder puts the book back among the others on the shelf
onto mulder starting up the street when he notices kurtzweil has stepped from between two apartments
hes staring at mulder nodding furtively to him
then stepping back
slows then speeds up
mulder appears at the end of the narrow walkway finding kurtzweil tucked a few yards in
see this bullshit
somebody knows im talking to you
not according to the men in blue
what is it
kiddie porn again
sexual battery of a patient
ive had my license taken away in three states
they want to discredit you for what
because im a dangerous man
because i know too much about the truth
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write
i knew your name was familiar
i just didnt know why
you know my work
kurtzweil im not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide
i dont believe in the elders of zion the knights templar the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government i dont either but it sure sells books
he says it with an ironic smile
causing mulder to turn and start off
but kurtzweil hurries to grab him to prevent this
i was right about dallas
wasnt i agent mulder
i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government
the daily newspaper
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency
according to the newspaper fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus
are you familiar with the hanta virus agent mulder
it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u
several years ago
and are you familiar with fema
what the federal emergency management agencys real power is
fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency
to create a non elected government
think about that
beat what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas
are you saying it wasnt such a small outbreak
kurtzweil is getting intense now
im saying it wasnt the hanta virus
they are both given a start when a police cruiser rolls by on the street giving a burp of its siren
it rolls past as the two men tuck in tighter
what was it
when we were young men in the military your father and i were recruited for a project
they told us it was biological warfare
there were rumors about its origins
what killed those men
what killed them i wont even write about
i tell you theyd do more than just harass me
they have the future to protect
ill know soon enough
worked up what killed those men cant be identified in simple medical terms
my god we cant even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv
we have no context for what killed those men or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future
of how it will be transmitted of the environmental factors involved
the plague to end all plagues agent mulder
a silent weapon for a quiet war
the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure
theyve been working on this for fifty years
while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon
negotiating with whom
i think you know
the timetable has been set
it will happen on a holiday when people are away from their homes
when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country
the president will declare a state of emergency at which time all federal agencies all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency
fema agent mulder
the secret government
and they tell me im paranoid
somethings gone wrong something unanticipated
go back to dallas and dig
or youre only going to find out like the rest of the country agent mulder
when its too late
kurtzweil turns starts off
mulder stares after him
then how can i reach you
mulder moves to catch up to kurtzweil pulling out his cell phone
kurtzweil stops turns
truly and intensely paranoid
mulder makes him take the cell phone
no calling hawaii
mulder turns and moves back out onto the street
agent scully wears a surgical mask latex gloves
working on the body of the fireman
when she reacts to a noise
doors opening closing somewhere o
camera medium whips to a door where she and mulder entered the morgue
the young naval guard and two mps push through and enter
they stand looking at where scully stood moments ago there is now just an unattended gurney
a sheet over the firemans body
scully is gone
resume young naval guard mps tense
moving into the room
scully enters the space where she and mulder found the firemans body
trying to quietly click the door shut
standing now near the door tense listening
when the chirping of her cell phone breaks the tense silence
she pats frantically at her coat trying to get it answered before it rings again
finally getting a hold of it and hitting the send button
scully sits breathing heavy nervous breaths waiting for the young naval guard to come running in
she puts the phone slowly up to her face
low whisper yeah
mulders at the pay phone
why are you whispering
i cant really talk right now
what did you find
evidence of a massive infection
what kind of infection
i dont know
scully listen to me
im going home then im booking a flight to dallas
im getting you a ticket too
mulder i need you there with me
i need your expertise on this
the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by
ive got a hearing tomorrow ill have you back for it scully
maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away
mulder i cant im already way past the point of common sense here scully hears voices in the hall outside the freezer
but the line off goes dead
mulder hangs up the phone frustrated
exits the booth in a hurry
the door opens and the young naval guard steps inside followed by the mps
moving into the room
with the naval guards feet as they pass by the rolling carts on which bodies are laid
tracking to find scully where she hides under one of the carts
huddled and cold
the guards feet stop near here
he stands motionless for a moment then moves off
hold her until the door slams shut
enters a forensics lab with a field agent
a legend reads fbi field office dallas am
youre looking for what amounts to a needle in a haystack
im afraid the explosion was so devastating there hasnt been a whole lot weve been able to put together just yet
they are walking amid boxes of evidence
stacks of debris
there are forensic techs sorting through this material
it looks like the most tedious and painstaking job in the world
im looking for anything out of the ordinary
maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found
we werent expecting to find those remains of course
they went right off to washington
was there anything in those offices that didnt go to d
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning
we thought thered been another fatality but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town
have you examined them
just fossils far as i know
mulder is nodding when both men look off at something thats caught their attention o
id like this person to take a look if you dont mind
standing in the doorway to the lab
she looks at mulder as if shes come in spite of her misgivings
moving toward them now
let me just see if i can lay my hands on what youre looking for
the field agent nods to scully as he passes exiting deeper into the room
leaving mulder and scully by themselves momentarily
you said you werent coming
i wasnt planning on it
particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning
but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen
what did you find
voice lowering pointedly something i couldnt show to anyone else
not without more information
and not without causing the kind of attention id just as soon avoid right now
off mulders look the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat ive never seen before
what it did to them it did extremely fast
and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain it survives very nicely outside the body
how was it contracted
that i dont know
but if its through simple contact of blood to blood and if it doesnt respond to conventional treatments it could be a serious health threat
mulders reaction is postponed or at least subdued by the reappearance of the field agent
like i said these are fossils and they werent near the blast center so they arent going to tell you much
he offers scully the small glass vials in which the bone fragments have been separated
she takes them looking at them on her way over to the microscope
tapping out a tiny fragment onto the viewing bed
she puts her eyes down to the stereoscope eyepieces then almost immediately looks up at mulder who translates this look almost instantly
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found
show you right on a map
off mulder and scullys traded looks the domed white tent is still in place the fleet of trucks and equipment surrounding it unmanned
several large sound dampened generators still hum away but the work being done here would be a mystery to anyone who didnt have access to the tent
an electric bobcat like bulldozer maneuvers a very high tech looking clear container to the edge of the earthen hole
the container has monitors and gauges on it oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation refrigeration unit
a self contained life support system
the inside of the container is covered with a thin layer of frost
when the small bulldozer gets the container over near the hole several technicians lift it down off the shovel hand carrying it toward the hole opening
bronschweig appears moving to a ladder that leads down into the hole
hes dressed in a haz mat suit with the hood off
i need to have those settings checked and re set
i need a steady minus two celsius through the transfer of the body after i administer the vaccine
the men nod to bronschweig begin checking the settings as bronschweig puts his hood on starts down into the hole through the clear hatch
the refrigeration vents are still pumping in arctic air when dr
bronschweig appears descending a fixed ladder
it is dark in here save for the ice blue glow of light coming from the plastic draped area where we saw the fireman acting as an incubator host for
some kind of organism growing inside him
bronschweig steps over to this area moves aside the plastic drapery to enter
where the body of the fireman is still inside the quarantine bubble litter in f
bronschweig takes out of his pocket a syringe and an ampule
turning now to the body
stepping to it
moving a work light as he had done for the cigarette smoking man so that it shines on the face of the fireman
but when he does this bronschweig nearly jumps his breath stolen away
reacting to the chest and torso have imploded
it has been turned into a muddy mass of blood stained jelly bone and tissue melted into an oozing mass which has sunken due to the fact that the creature
which was inside is now gone
camera whips from bronschweig to the wall
to the temperature gauge which reads about degrees celsius
whipping back to bronschweig who is now panicked
angle down on earthen hole where the technicians bronschweig was speaking to minutes ago react to bronschweigs muffled voice
hes down below them in the cave looking up
pulling his haz mat hood off
yelling up to them
its left the body
i think its gestated bronschweig is starting up the ladder when something stops him
he stands frozen on the ladder squinting into the darkness
wait i see it in the shadows there is movement the creature edging into the light cast from the draped area
we see it is fully formed a replica of the creature we saw at the opening of our story
though it does not make any kind of aggressive move
as if newborn it is tentative
he remains standing on a rung of the ladder for a moment then takes a gentle step back down to the ground
nervous wonder oh my god
oh my god
you see it
you want to get down here sotto to himself jesus lord
so much for little green men
bronschweig moves shakily to put the syringe in the ampule again
when suddenly the creature strikes
as the creature slams into bronschweig knocking him out of the line of sight from the top of the earthen hole
there are screams of pain from bronschweig then they abate
bronschweig can be heard but not clearly seen
he is in the shadows himself now
trying to pick himself up and when he manages to do this teetering back into the light we see that he is bloodied
he is hurt injured
making his way back toward the patch of light that comes from the hole above
hoping to see that help is on its way while keeping a watchful wary and worried eye on the shadows for another attack by the creature
hey i need help
but the technicians looking down on him offer him nothing of the sort
all they do is quickly close the clear hatch that seals bronschweig inside the cave
but he gets no answer climbing the ladder shakily
a moment later the first bobcat shovel full of dirt falls onto the clear hatch and partially obscures the light
they are burying bronschweig alive
angle down on bronschweig through the glass hatch
his screams continue
adjusting to the small bulldozer which is quickly hauling the mound of excavated earth into the hole from which it came
while all around there is a hive of activity
men running everywhere
bronschweig reacts in silent horror now only to turn in further horror when he feels the impending attack of right behind and just below him
its grotesque features in momentary high resolution before it attacks camera
over and over savaging bronschweig in a violent fury
its hideous teeth tearing at his flesh at camera driving him off the ladder where the attack continues in momentary glimpses of teeth of bloody flesh and of oily black
blood being spattered about
at the height of the violence we hear bronschweig scream
matching the wound of this as we a childs scream of joy
english children are playing tag or some kind of childrens game in the well manicured garden of a man who the camera finds in f
the man we have come to know as the well manicured man
he is also a member of the syndicate running the project though his venality is cloaked in civility and statesmanship
right now hes watching the children from the back steps of his mansion charmed by their game
when he is called by someone o
sir you have a call
the well manicured man turns to see holds the door
after a moment the w
enters past the valet
as the screams of the children continue to rise and fall
the well manicured man enters picks up a blinking line
through a window he can still see the children playing
we have a situation
the members are assembling
is it an emergency
a meeting is set
tonight in london to determine a course
who called this meeting
hes just gotten on a plane in tunis
this pronouncement has the power of ending any further questions
an immediate sense of gravity of the situation
hangs up moves to the window where he sees some of the help is running from the house
the children have all gathered around a boy who seems to have hurt himself
hes lifted and being carried by the man whos called the w
into the house
off the well manicured mans concern we a discreet town car pulls up out front an understated building in a better west end neighborhood
a driver exits coming around for the well manicured man who is already exiting moving to the building
as a legend appears kensington london pm
the well manicured man is admitted by a valet
the interior has the well heeled look of money or a finely appointed residence that no one lives in
the valet takes the w
has strughold arrived
theyre in the library
he leads the w
down a hall to a group of men are standing looking at something on a tv monitor
a surveillance video
they turn when the w
camera favoring a small lean man with close cropped hair
he is at once elegant and imposing with eyes that hold you with laser like acuity
he is conrad strughold
the others are of various ethnicities tailored and dignified
this might be a collection of u
indeed some are
their business here however doesnt represent anyones interests but their own
as tipped by the attendance of a group elder from the u
who weve come to know
but more importantly by the cigarette smoking man who holds the vcr remote
he pauses the picture
we began to worry
some of us have traveled so far and you are the last to arrive
my grandson fell and broke his leg
the non response to this has the same effect as a reprimand
but the w
will not apologize of kowtow
while weve been made to wait weve watched surveillance tapes which have raised more concerns
the well manicured man glances to the tv sees the frame paused
where mulder and scullys faces are seen in a hallway that we recognize as the bethesda naval hospital
more concerns than that
weve been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves
speaking up the virus has mutated
on its own
its effect on the host has changed
the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism
its developed a way to modify the host body
a new extraterrestrial biological entity
it takes a moment to sink in
the weight of this fact
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re evaluations for us
about our place in their colonization
this isnt colonization its spontaneous repopulation
all our work
if its true then theyve been using us all along
weve been laboring under a lie
it could be an isolated case
how can we know
were going to tell them what weve found
what weve learned
turn over a body infected with the gestating organism
in hope of what
learning that its true
that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms
let me remind you who is the new race
and who is the old
beat what could be gained by withholding anything from them by pretending to ignorance
our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable
to start colonization early
and if it doesnt
by cooperating now were but beggars to our demise
our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all
cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves
they still need us to carry out their preparations
well continue to use them as they do us
if only to play for more time to continue work on our vaccine
our vaccine may have no effect
well without a cure for the virus were nothing more than digestives anyway
all eyes go to the well manicured man
he is respected if not the odd man out in this room
but he is all restrained anger now
my lateness may have well been absence
a course has already been taken
there are complications
he turns back to the tv monitor where mulder and scully remain frozen on the screen
do they know
mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence
hes gone back there again
someone has tipped him
kurtzweil we think
weve allowed this man his freedom
his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial
has he outlived his usefulness to us
no one believes kurtzweil or his books
hes a toiler
our new situation makes us vulnerable
if he learns information as we do he could jeopardize the projects secrecy
control of information means control of mulder
i can control mulder
ive always controlled mulder
this may take another approach
he says this casting his look toward the well manicured man
a look of cold malevolence
s reaction is disdain
you cant kill mulder
hes got too much light on him
you need not kill a man to destroy him
personalizing the inference no you need only take away what is most precious to him
she stands against a backdrop of texas flatland squinting into the sun
shaking her head
i dont know mulder
we are wide angle reverse to include mulder standing in the middle of a park replete with jungle gyms playground equipment
all brand spanking new
they are standing right where there had once been a hard scrabble parched and barren little field
where the earthen hole had been dug by the young boys
and what had later been the site of so much activity by the group of scientists
but where theres now a park thick green grass covering the parch of ground including the spot where the hole had been
he didnt mention a park
this is where he marked on the map scully
where he says those fossils were unearthed
i dont see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite
not even a sewer or a storm drain
mulder scans the area confounded
shaking his head as they walk
youre sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the firemans body in the morgue
nodding the bone was porous as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it
and youve never seen anything like that
it didnt show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests mulder is listening to all this while looking down at his feet this looks like new grass to you
it looks pretty green for this climate
mulder stops kneels touches the thick green carpet of turf
he digs around lifting up a corner of a new square
grounds dry about an inch down
somebody just laid this down
very recently id say
looking off all the equipment is brand new
no irrigation system
somebodys covering their tracks
they both turn looking at something thats caught their attention on the street where their rental car is parked
three kids all of whom we recognize from earlier
tooling down the street on new bmx bikes
reacting to mulders loud whistle
this stops them staring at mulder blankly across the distance
they dont answer
just keep staring squinting into the sun
mulder and scully start walking toward them
do you live around here
as the agents approach
you see anybody digging here
the kids dont answer quickly
not supposed to talk about it
youre not supposed to talk about it
who told you that
same nobody who put this park in
that new equipment
off the boys guilty looks they buy you these bikes
the kids shift uncomfortably
i think you better tell us
we dont even know you
well were fbi agents
youre not fbi agents
how do you know
cause fbi agents wear like suits and goofy ties
and dresses like my mom wears to church
like on that one show
mulder and scully pull their badges
the kids mouths drop
maybe youve been watching too much they all left twenty minutes ago
going that way
the kids all pointing in the same direction
as mulder and scullys rental car races by at high speed
mulder at the wheel foot to the floor
scullys got a map out
the mood is urgent tense
unmarked tanker trucks
what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks
i dont know mulder
and where are they going with it
thats the first question to answer if were going to find them
mulder slows down to a stop
theyve come to a three way intersection in the middle of absolutely nowhere that offers them three choices
the car sits idling for several beats
mulders got his hand on his face rubbing his eyes
what are my choices
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction
where would they be going
weve got two choices
one of them is wrong
they are both looking in different directions
the car idling
you think they went left
i dont know why i think they went right
a few moments of silence
then mulder steps on the gas and goes straight
heading out onto the only unpaved road
scully looks at him wondering
as they bump along at speed
mulder wont look at her for a few moments
then turning to her five years together how many times have i been wrong
headlights appear in the distance on a long dusty stretch of road
growing as they approach then coming to a stop in a cloud of dust as they move into f
where a line of fenceposts barbwire blocks their path
as the car brakes the passenger door opens and scully exits
a hot texas wind blows
a dog is barking somewhere
scully walks into the headlight wash looking at a sign on the fence
after a moment the drivers door opens and mulder exits
hey i was right about the bomb wasnt i
this is great
this is fitting
on the fence sign painted in crude letters are the words some have tried some have died
turn back no what
ive got to be in washington d
in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life
and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas chasing phantom tanker trucks
were not chasing trucks were chasing evidence of what exactly
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself
they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks they dont haul viruses in tanker trucks
yeah well they may this one
what do you mean by haul
off his reaction what are you not telling me here
this virus it
afraid to say mulder it may be extraterrestrial
i dont believe this
i dont fucking believe this
reaching her limit of impatience yknow ive been here
ive been here one too many times with you mulder
pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night
chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope only to find myself standing right where i am right now at another dead end as she says this a bell starts
a flashing light hits mulder and scully
they both turn to see sitting all by its lonely self
no swinging arms or gate
just one little sign between mulder and scully and their car
camera panning to the light of a locomotive speeding toward us
they move toward their car but the train is coming fast
mulder and scully stop and wait watching the train
as the engine breaks frame eclipsing mulder and scully from view
and as it passes by we see two very familiar white tankers loaded piggyback atop flat bed cars
the train which is not much longer than this passes
and mulder and scully make a mad dash for their car
the lights come on and mulder swings the vehicle into a hard accelerating turn taking the spoke of the intersection that parallels the tracks
as the car hauls ass after the train we the rails come up a grade where they appear out of a long bending turn
exiting the mountain pass near the summit of the mountain
and now headlights appear bouncing toward us
its mulder and scullys rental chugging up the grade
and now pulling to a stop as it reaches camera
then the car doors open and mulder and scully exit
putting jackets against the cold desert night
running over the gravel on the rail bed into sharp f
what do you think it is
i have no idea
they start out toward it anyway whatever it is
but the image that we see next might cause us to ask the same question
the agents are moving off the tracks now picking their way toward the horizon where at the edge of the great plateau that lays out before them there are two
giant it is otherwise pitch dark out almost giving the impression that the domes are floating
it would give the distinct impression of otherworldliness if we hadnt seen a similar smaller glowing dome over the dirt field where the boys found the skull
and if we could not see the lights of the train rolling to a stop near the mysterious domes
slowly craning down as mulder and scully move through the low scrub of the high desert
moving towards us as camera continues its slow crane down revealing in f
the tops of corn stalks yes corn stalks
what is the perimeter edge of acres and acres of corn fields laying out before us in the dark night
running all the way to the white domed tents in the b
mulder and scully enter the perimeter edge disappearing into tracking with mulder and scully as they move through the field
this is weird mulder
any thoughts on why anybodyd be growing corn in the middle of the desert
not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there
continue tracking as they move through the tall uniform rows
shooting down the long straight rows
craning up to reveal domes once again
like space ships that have landed
the agents exit the edge of the crop field
they have come upon the glowing tents now
tall and pillowy against the dark sky
there is no evidence of anyone about
no sound no signs
mulder and scully stand at the edge of the field for a moment
then move cautiously across an open area to one of the domes
mulder pulls open the steel door leading in
it opens with a sucking sound which suggests the interior is pressurized
and as he and scully step in they both jump when large fans just overhead hit them both with hard blasts of air
stepping quickly out of the downward blasting air into the still silence of the space beyond
cool in here
temperatures being regulated
for the purpose of what
our view is down through the crosswires and cables that create the tension support
the effect is a combination of simplicity and perfect function
stark and high tech
the flooring is gray and flat featureless
but we dont yet see from this angle exactly what the white domed tent houses
though the air is still and there is no movement of any kind there is a sound that permeates the interior
a steady hum
almost electrical hum but different
mulder and scully move together toward the middle of the space
laid out in a grid low to the ground are what look like boxes
fixed in place like roof vents except these are on the floor no more than three feet tall and about the same measure square
as they continue to move cautiously walking out into the grid of box shaped objects
coming to the center of the capacious arena sized space
standing over one of the mysterious boxes which we now see have louvered tops
the louvers however are shut so that whatever is inside the boxes cannot be seen
i think were on top of something
i think these are some kind of venting
mulder lays his head and ear to the top of the box
you hear that
i hear the humming
high voltage maybe
scully looks skyward
what do you think those are for
mulder takes his ear off the box looking up now too
at the top of the dome are two large corresponding looking up at these vents
high wide angle over mulder and scully staring up just past camera at the louvered vents at top center of the tent
when a loud metallic noise makes them jump
one of the vents is opening automatically its large metal louvers straining from their flat closed position into an up and down open position
when this is complete the second louver does the same
the straining sound of galvanized metal on metal
as mulder turns his look from the ceiling back down to the mysterious box theyre standing next to
something occurs to him
mulder grabs her hand pulling her along
though she doesnt know why
or whats about to happen
tracking fast with them as mulder leads her back toward the door they entered which is a good hundred yards away
yelling on the run what are you doing
yelling back come on
when the louvered vents on all the low grid arranged boxes open in domino like succession out of them pouring thousands and thousands of bees rapidly filling the atmosphere of
the domed space
as if the insects are being shot out of non stop cannons
thick streams of bees head right at camera flying for the open louvers at the top of the dome
as mulder and scully run for it down below
scullys hand slipping from mulders as she pulls her jacket up over her head
mulder doing the same now ducking his head inside his own jacket
the agents are slowed by the bees but still make their zigzag way toward the door bees clinging to their clothes
but motion seems to be the key
as mulder runs toward camera where the downward blast of air knocks all the bees off him
in the b
we see that scully has fallen behind
still running but losing her way in the process losing her bearings as the thickening swarm of bees descends
when mulder enters frame jacket pulled over his head again
taking scully by the back of her coat and swinging her toward the direction of the door
whipsnapping her the rest of the distance to the doorfans
following right behind her as the fans blasting them and the agents continue right out the doors
to scully and mulder comes blasting out themselves now but they havent even had time to catch their breaths when they react to movement
something coming at them in the night
where bright beams blast on moving fast toward them
the rushing whir of the turbine engines of the unmarked choppers
the bright beams skimming across the ground toward mulder and scully traveling right along the edges of ends of the white domed tents
threatening to spot the agents unless they run
and they do bolting just as the beams and the helicopters blast over the spot they held just moments before
running to running flat out now knocking away the stalks and leaves that block their way
following and leading shots
povs and tracking shots
and chasing angles as the agents run through the only cover theyve got
as the unmarked helicopters swoop right overhead their bright spotlights searching and cutting through the cornrows
as the agents zig and zag just out of the discovering beams
as the choppers zoom right over their heads
traversing the field then doing sharp banking turns and swooping back over the field now in low drifting hovers
the wash from the blades knocking the corn stalks down so as to reveal anything hidden within
the bright spots making sure that nothing might escape detection
as she runs up into frame
shes lost sight of mulder
as he too runs to a stop
hearing his name
reacting to the sound of her name but theres no time to find her bearings on mulder
not before she has to take flight again
as one of the choppers appears overhead hovering into view
knocking the corn down in a path moving straight toward her
camera leading her as she runs from the oncoming craft
passing camera to the left as the chopper passes camera beating his way through the corn like bomba through the jungle
matching this action as mulder runs toward us
when one of the unmarked helicopters breaks into frame in an intersecting path its beam passing right over mulder and illuminating him
but while it doesnt slow mulder down the helicopter maneuvers into a hard banking turn sweeping over the far end of the corn field and heading where mulder bursts out
of the perimeter turning on a quick dime and running an out pattern just before the chopper bursts into frame overhead its search beam narrowly missing mulder
running the corner of the field looking frantically down each corn row until he comes to a stop
no sign of scully
mulder reacting to the sound of her response distant o
shes exiting the field behind him
running toward him and when she gets to him they both break into a run across the desert
camera following them as they sprint away
following them until they both start to slow
slowing to a stop in the darkness
turning to see the helicopters have disappeared
reacting to this
whered they go
i dont know
then they both turn again and continue running
as fast as their feet will take them
back towards the bluff where their car is parked
where mulder and scullys car is parked
stillness until mulder and scullys heads appear as they climb up from the direction of the corn fields
they get in their car and start it quickly
mulder turns the ignition but the car doesnt start immediately
he turns it over and over but it wont kick
as he does this unbeknownst to the agents one of the black helicopters rises up from below the bluff appearing in their rear windshield
hovering just behind the car like a giant bumblebee
mulder gets the car started throwing the transmission in gear and spinning the tires
as they head off back in the direction they came without their lights on
as they do this the black chopper continues to hover for a moment then banks off and away
into the night
mulder and scully speed off in the opposite direction
as we being leafed through by a womans hands
camera tilting up to special agent cassidy the woman we met earlier running the opr hearing
she takes a quick glance at her watch looking up when opens
a beat then skinner enters with a wearied look
shes coming in
skinner ducks his head back out to look at where scully stands looking into the glass of a display case trying to put her hair and clothes and person together
shes still in the same clothes we saw her in
seeing skinner now moving toward him
scully enters past skinner
though she has straightened them and her hair there is no mistaking that shes been to the dust bowl and back to get here
her manner is chastened
scully tries to keep her eyes on the table where shell be sitting
venturing only a brief polite look to they reshuffle their papers pulling up their chairs
ready to get down to business now
special agent scully i apologize for making you wait ive brought some new evidence with me evidence of what
reaching into her satchel pulling out an evidence bag
whatever shes reaching for shes reluctant to present with confidence
these are fossilized bone fragments ive been able to study gathered from the bomb site in dallas
as scully speaks we see a bee crawl out from under the collar of her suit jacket crawling toward the back of her neck
crawling slowly as if stretching its legs from its long journey
camera dollying around scully as the bee does moving into an over to youve been back to dallas
are you going to let us in on what exactly youre trying to prove that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen so
their deaths and the reason for them wouldnt have to be explained challenging those are very serious allegations agent scully yes
there is a hush of murmured responses to this the panel members speaking to one another
assistant director skinner shifts uneasily in his chair
hes been here before with agents mulder and scully
hes sensing something outrageous
and you have conclusive evidence of this
something to tie this claim of yours to the crime grudgingly nothing completely conclusive we have returned to the over angle on scully where we see the bee just below
her jacket collar on the back of her neck
it crawls back under her collar disappearing from sight
i hope to
were working to develop this evidence working with
off cassidys knowing nod a general shifting in chairs we mulder pushes through the front scanning the room for sitting at a booth at the dark rear of the establishment
mulder enters frame sitting down across from him
kurtzweil is jumpy but he sees from mulders expression that somethings up
you found something
on the texas border
some kind of experiment
something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks
im not sure
a virus you saw this experiment
what did it look like
there were bees
and corn crops
kurtzweil smiles at mulder laughs with nervous excitement
mulder doesnt quite realize it yet but this is news to him
what are they
kurtzweil slides from his seat rising
what do you think
a transportation system
the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus
that would be my guess
but kurtzweil doesnt respond to this
hes moving toward the back of the bar
mulder slides out pursuing him
the few patrons sitting at the bar all turning in reaction to this sudden flurry of activity
near the bathrooms
mulder catches up to kurtzweil
what do you mean your guess
kurtzweil doesnt stop
so mulder must physically stop him
you told me you had answers
yeah well i dont have them all
youve been using me ive been using you
you didnt know my father i told you he and i were old friends youre a liar
you lied to me to gather information for you
for your goddamn books
mulder is getting heated rough with kurtzweil
when unexpectedly a man suddenly exits the bathroom
reacting to this scene
kurtzweil uses the moment to break from mulder
slipping out the back door
mulder takes a beat then goes after him
pushing out the back door into the blinding brightness
mulder busts out the back door chasing kurtzweil
kurtzweil turns to him
with restrained ferocity
youd be shit out of luck if not for me
you saw what you saw because i led you to it
im putting my ass on the line for you
i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters
and why do you think it is youre standing here talking to me
these people dont make mistakes agent mulder
and with that he turns now striding off
leaving mulder to deal with the excellent logic of this
when suddenly mulder reacts to a noise
somewhere above him
up on a fire escape a man is moving
mulder can only see his feet and legs from this angle but it is clear he has been watching mulder
upon being spotted the figure slides away and disappears
we get a glimpse of the man who was watching him
a face we recognize as that of the man who brushed past mulder coming out of the vending room not long before the building in dallas blew
he is moving quickly now disappearing into the shadows
camera tilting down to find mulder
he stands staring up but only for a moment until he turns and hurries off in the opposite direction kurtzweil disappeared in
angle over mulders desk at the far end of the living room
the sound of keys in the door then mulder enters his apartment in a hurry
moving to the desk and going at this pace through the drawers
a which he takes now leafing through it
flipping the pages looking for finding old pictures of young fox mulder with his sister samantha
with his father and mother
the plastic covered page is peeled back and one of these photos is removed
it is an old family snapshot
a picnic possibly
mulder stares at the picture
insert photo in the b
of the picnic his head turned to camera is a young kurtzweil
mulder studies the photo intensely when theres a knock at his door
mulder turning to see in his haste mulder had neglected to lock his door
scully is pushing it open
shes still in the same clothes
she looks beat
her eyes meeting mulders
a gaze that says bad news
salt lake city utah
transfer effective immediately
mulder is shaking his head
not wanting to hear this
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation
you cant quit scully
i can mulder
i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew were close to something here were on the verge youre on the verge mulder please dont
do this to me after what you saw last night after all youve seen you cant just walk away i have
just like that im contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers i need you on this scully you dont mulder youve never needed me
ive only held you back
beat ive got to go
and with that she exits his apartment the argument too painful and her ability to be persuaded too clear to herself
wide angle from end of hall where we see scully leaving mulders apartment
moving at a hurried clip to the elevator toward camera
as if anticipating her own impulse to turn around and go back
as she moves into f
mulder exits his apt
youre wrong he hurries to catch her
as she turns on him
why was i assigned to you
to debunk your work
to reign you in
to shut you down
you saved me scully
off her look as different and frustrating as its been sometimes your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times have kept me honest and made me
i owe you so much scully and you owe me nothing
beat i dont want to do this without you
i dont know if i can
if i quit now they win
she is silent moved
in spite of all her desire not to be
she moves to mulder holds him
they break slightly and she looks up at mulder with deep respect admiration and
kisses him on the forehead
suddenly a physical intimacy weve never seen
a heat and passion that cant be denied
the opportunity for the inevitable has presented itself
the moment of truth has arrived
mulder is staring at scully as shes looking back at him
his head moves slightly toward hers as one of his hands moves up to her neck drawing her to him
where there is hesitation on her part there is also desire
when scully pulls away from mulder rubbing at her neck where his hand had been
something stung me
scullys hand comes out with the squirming bee which she holds in her hand while mulder moves around her checking her neck
but he doesnt finish his sentence before he has to catch scully from falling
her head bobs and she has to catch it
fighting for clarity im having lancinating pain my chest
motor functions are being affected
mulder lays her down on the floor during this
scully continues to speak though her eyes are not focusing
she is limp in mulders arms
my pulse feels thready and ive got a funny taste in the back of my throat
i think youre in anaphylactic shock no its her voice is getting thin now too
scully ive got no allergy
i think you should call an ambulance
and mulder is on his feet in a flash running for close over phone as mulder races into the apartment dashing toward camera picking up the receiver dialing
holding on the phone during this action
tilting up for this is special agent fox mulder
i have an emergency i have an agent down picked up and one two three loaded on a gurney by two can you hear me
can you say your name
scully is trying but the words wont come out
shes got constriction in the throat and larynx are you breathing okay
he lays his head down to her mouth
passages are open
lets get her in the van neighbors are in the hall now along with mulder
who is moving beside the paramedics as they hustle the gurney down the hall
coming through people here we go
coming through the paramedics bang out the front door stutter stepping the gurney down to the walk to their emt van which sits at the curb with the light bar
mulder following close by
she said she had a taste in the back of her throat there was no pre existing allergy to bee stings the bee that stung her may have been carrying
a virus a virus
get on the radio tell them we have a cytogenic reaction we need an advise and administer they get her to the back of the vehicle guiding the gurney in
with experienced hands
scullys eyes are on mulder as shes slid into the brightly lit interior
the st paramedic blocks mulder somewhat as he steps toward the van anticipating that hes going with them to the hospital
but the doors are closing on him before he gets an opportunity
following mulder around to the drivers side of the van now moving to the drivers window where the driver can be seen in the rear view mirror his eyes watching
a moment of vague recognition a catch in his step
as mulders momentum carries him to the drivers window where se see again the man from the vending room who was also surveilling mulder
and he has a handgun pointed at mulder which he fires through the window
the glass shattering
throwing himself away backward but the bullet catches him in the head
blood and glass spraying onto the side of the van
he goes down to the ground as the paramedic van accelerates fast away
lying in the street his head bleeding profusely
while in the b
a second ambulance is speeding to the scene
as it skids to a stop and two new paramedics jump out we a medium sized private jet is taxiing down an alley off the main runway where a is
speeding toward takeoff
the private jet turning toward camera and nosing into f
where men in familiar black fatigues are unloading something from an unmarked cube truck that is also familiar the very high tech looking clear container with its monitors and gauges
its oxygen tanks and refrigeration unit
a self contained life support system
the inside of the container is covered with a thin layer of frost through which we can see agent she lies as if in a state of paralysis but a
blink of her eyes is enough to tell us that she is
tracking with the men moving the container
as they hustle it to the waiting jet
as the cigarette smoking man is descending the steps of the plane onto the tarmac
watching as the container is moved to the cargo hold and loaded inside
the hold is closed and the jet engines wind back up
as the cigarette smoking man reboards the aircraft and it taxis away
voices fade in slowly inaudible at first
for regular viewers of the show they will recognize the voices of the lone gunmen
three nerdish paranoiacs who publish a magazine which charts and cataloged conspiracies past and present among other government malfeasance
they are langly byers and frohike
i think hes coming out hes coming to
fade up as if our eyes are blinking open
we are in mulders pov and the face right above us is frohikes
behind frohike looking down at mulder are byers and langly
staring at the diminutive frohike the long haired langly and the courtly byers with dawning recognition
to byers then langly tin man
to frohike toto
mulder sits up now rubbing his face feeling the bandage hes got on his head
what am i doing here
you were shot in the head
the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate
woozy penetration but not perforation
three centimetres to the left and wed be playing the harp
mulder is still shaking out the cobwebs
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma
but youve been unconscious since they brought you in
when was that
two days ago
your guy skinners been here with you around the clock
we got the news and made a trip to your apartment
found a bug in your phone line
and one in your hall
byers holds up the first small device
frohike holds up a vial containing a bee
mulder realizing scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting you called
except the call was intercepted
sitting up they took her mulder pushes the covers off
swinging his legs to the ground
skinner enters the room
surprised to see mulder up
agent mulder wheres scully
as he says this he loses his balance slightly has to hold onto one of the gunmen
struggling with his faculties
weve been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in
whoever they are this goes right back to dallas it goes right back to the bombing i know
off mulders reaction to this agent scully reported your suspicions to opr
on the basis of her report i sent techs over to s
they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas
reeling how deep does this go
i dont know
mulder sees a man in a suit passes by the small window in the door casting a furtive glance in then moving off
he turns his look back to skinner
are we being watched
im not taking any chances
pulling now at the bandage on his head
peeling it away and revealing the wound beneath
i need your clothes byers
what are you doing
ive got to find scully
do you know where she is
but i know someone who might have an answer
mulder is undoing his hospital gown now his white buns gracing the screen for the first time in history
as he ducks into the bathroom
as the men left standing in the room all look to byers reluctantly removing his duds
off this angle over man in a suit standing with his back to mulders room reading a section of a newspaper the rest of the paper sitting on a chair
as if the mans possibly set up here
as the door to mulders room opens in the b
and frohike appears
frohike keeps his eyes on the man as langly appears now followed by
we cant see clearly as the other two block our pov and the third man out doesnt show us his face
the threesome starts down the hall their footsteps drawing the attention of the man in a suit
as they head toward camera
walking at a pace
in the b
the man in the suit is drifting toward mulders hospital room
he moves to the door looks in the little glass window
byers the sheets pulled up to his nose to hide his beard and mustache
skinner standing next to him talking on the phone
the man in the suit looking down to the end of the hall again
as mulder and his two flankers move right to camera
mulder is taking a cell phone being handed to him by frohike
dialing on the move
a figure appears at the end of the alley moving toward us
it could be mulder from this distance but as the figure comes closer we recognize him as kurtzweil
moving into the f
checking behind him ahead of him
he takes a cautious beat then moves to the door leading into the bar established reaching for the knob
opening it finding the well manicured man standing there
kurtzweil isnt it
kurtzweil is shaken by the sight of this man
backpedaling a bit looking around and behind him for an ambush
certainly youve been expecting some response to your indiscretion
steps out of the doorway following kurtzweil
im quite sure whatever you told agent mulder you have your good reason
its a weakness in men our age the urge to confess
stopping his walk i forgive you that
kurtzweil is thrown by the words and the delivery
stopping his backward progress
studying this upright and civil man
what are you doing here
what do you want from me
you must try to understand what im here to do is only to protect my children
you and i have but short lives left
i can only hope the same isnt true for them
on this note kurtzweil turns and hoofs it back in the direction from which he came
tracking back with him until headlights hit his face
a town car has pulled into the alley behind him
accelerating fast down the narrow corridor
effectively trapping kurtzweil in
as he squints into its headlights then turns back with fear in his eyes to the where a figure is coming down the street toward us
running its mulder going balls out
running to the entrance of the bar and yanking open the door
moderately crowded as mulder enters stopping to catch his breath
moving to the back of the bar
looking for its empty
moving through the bar real panic in his expression
he heads to the back
mulder passing the bathrooms moving to the door where we saw the well manicured man standing just a short bit ago
but there is no one back here now
mulder moves to the back door the one leading to the alley pushing it open and finding the well manicured man stands with his driver closing the trunk on the
idling town car which has been turned around
turns to see mr
what happened to kurtzweil
hes come and gone
moves to mulder who doesnt trust him for a second
mulder is still breathing hard sizing up this scene
i have answers for you
is she alive
mulder stares at the w
im quite prepared to tell you everything though there isnt much you havent guessed
about the conspiracy
i think of it as an agreement
a word your father liked to use
i want to know where scully is
the well manicured man suddenly reaches into his jacket pocket without warning or explanation
mulder tensing slightly
he removes a thin felt envelope
the location of agent scully
and the means to save her life
off mulders look please
he gestures toward the car where the driver stands with the back door open
mulder hesitates then steps from the doorway
moving past the w
gets in after him closes the door
the car pulls away
we see mulder in the back seat reflected in the rear view mirror
where we also see the eyes of the driver watching him
mulder is handed the felt envelope by the w
what is it
a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with
it must be administered with ninety six hours
beat youre lying
though i have no way to prove otherwise
the virus is extraterrestrial
we know very little about it except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet
dubious to say the least a virus
a simple unstoppable lifeform
what is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated
living in a cave underground until it mutates
this is what youve been conspiring to conceal
for god sake youve got it all backwards
this outburst comes suddenly unexpectedly
aids the ebola virus on the evolutionary scale they are newborns
this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs
what do you mean walked
your aliens agent mulder your little green men first landed here millions of years ago
those that didnt leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age
in the form of an evolved pathogen
waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet
using us as hosts
against this we have no defense
nothing but a weak vaccine
beat do you see why it was kept secret
why even the best men men like your father could not let the truth be known
the force and conviction of his delivery leave mulder shaken
until dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism
that mass infection would make us a slave race
thats why you bombed the building
the infected firemen the boy imagine our surprise when they began to gestate
my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists facilitating their programs
to give us access to the virus
in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure
so that we might save ourselves as the last of the species
beat your father wisely refused to believe this choosing hope over selfishness
hope is the only future he had his children beat then self revealing the only future any of us have
this draws a look back in the mirror from the driver
he sacrificed his own daughter
my sister samantha
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it those vaccinated against it and human alien hybrids
your father arranged for your sisters abduction
he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program so that she would survive
as a clone
beat he had different hopes for you
that you would uncover the truth about the project
that you would stop it
that you would fight the future
mulder sits stunned by this
as if somehow his destiny has been validated if not pre ordained
or maybe just justified
why are you telling me this
i thought it only fair you should know given how hard youve worked
what happened to kurtzweil
as your father knew things need to be sacrificed to the future
where is he
kurtzweil is in the trunk
mulder stares at the w
at his cold blooded expression
let me out
stop the car
mulder reaching to this as the limo pulls to a stop
trying the door but the door is locked
when he turns back to the w
he has produced a handgun which is now pointing at mulder
laid casually across a folded arm
mulder reacts on seeing it
the men i work with will stop at nothing to clear the way for what they believe is their stake in the inevitable future
i was ordered to kill kurtzweil
a necessary action to protect my grandchildrens lives
beat i might just as easily kill you
mulder is recoiling as he says this
then without hesitation in one quick move he shoots the driver in the head
the blood spattering on the front windshield and on mulder who has barely had a chance to react
trust no one mr
mulder looks at the well manicured man expecting to be next
and for a moment we do too
but the w
simply opens the door and steps out of the car
holding the door open for mulder who is still frozen by the actions that went just before
mulder steps out of the car holding the felt envelope
the well manicured man stands with a sober intense look
with quiet force you have precious little time
what ive given you the alien colonists have no idea exists
you hold in your hand the power to end the project
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus
its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans weve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years
beat or it may not
what alien environment
find agent scully
only her science can save the future
what about you
my life is over
mulder stands speechless for a moment
until the w
points the weapon hes still holding at him
and mulder does
moving away from the car looking back over his shoulder
as the well manicured man gets back into the limousine closes the door
a moment later
the car explodes into flames knocking mulder to the ground
the felt envelope has been jarred from his grasp
its contents loosed from inside a piece of paper with coordinates on it and an ampule and syringe
mulder gets up looks back
then he picks up the envelope and its contents and begins to run
running as fast as he can go
until far down the block he disappears
as the screen dissolves to whiteness under which we hear an ominous low end dolby thx big screen rumble
the same sound that opened our story
then there is movement as the curvilinear line of a horizon becomes visible bi secting the screen between the white of the earth and the white of the sky
we are across the expanse of whiteness a dark image appears on the long flat horizon
moving toward us
as a legend appears to establish
crawling across the harsh frozen land like a domed insect
agent mulder sits behind the controls of the enclosed cabin several days growth on his face
dressed in thick bundled outerwear
he maneuvers the vehicle to a stop
reaching for a handheld gps monitor to check his position
catching his breath for a moment all movement is exertion in this climate
mulder stares hard out the front window the wipers beating time but there is nothing out there but whiteness
he wipes the fog from a side window with his gloved hand seeing nothing but more whiteness
checking the gps device again then reaching for the door latch
agent mulder exits the vehicle hopping down onto the snowscape crust
setting out on foot with the gps device held before him
in this forbidding environment he might as well be taking a space walk without the security of a lifeline
which is the impression we get as his tiny figure trudges across the ice increasing the distance between himself and the snow tractor
up a gentle grade the snow tractor now behind him
moving into tight f
where he stops seeing something now which allows him to pocket the gps device
dropping instinctively to his knees so as to avoid being seen by in the distance is an ice station
a row of interconnecting white dome tents whose design is now familiar to us
there are what look like snow tractors and other snow vehicles parked alongside the structures
pulling a compact pair of binoculars from one of his deep jacket pockets
training them on panning across the domes and vehicles where there is no sign of personnel until mulder pans off the building finding in his field glasses an approaching snow
moving across the landscape toward the ice station
when it pulls to a stop a man exits out of one of the domes the cigarette smoking man
moving to the vehicle and getting in
the vehicle reverses now transporting the csm back away from the ice station
taking the field glasses away from his eyes
the excitement he feels expressed now in his breathing which has become harder and shallower
mulder rises beginning to move the still great distance between himself and the ice station
mulder moving slowly across the white horizon toward the domed tents
moving cautiously and with effort on the snowscape crust
camera rising up to mulders face determined and watchful
the ice station still several hundred yards in the distance when mulder suddenly falls out of frame disappearing into a hole in the snowscape crust that just moments earlier had
been stable footing
where mulders body falls through a ceiling of snowscape crust landing on his back with a thud on a hard surface
it takes him a moment to catch his breath somewhat reminiscent of stevie at the beginning of the picture
wincing through the pain
until he turns over regaining his wits and his bearings
mulder has fallen on a hard narrow metallic structure
its dull black color a stark contrast to the white ice its encased in
the bubble has been created by air coming out of vents in the structure carving out corresponding patterns in the ceiling softening the ice and snow above
rising to his knees the air from one of these vents blowing onto his face
pulling off the hood of his jacket looking deep into the vent which is open ungrated
and big enough for a man to crawl into
which after considering the hole hes fallen through high above him is really mulders only choice
mulder pulls himself forward through the ribbed corridor duct with his elbows moving lizard like into the constricted darkness
above a frozen ice lith mulders head appears squeezing his shoulders and body out of a venting
with effort mulder slides out of the small space using some architecture above as a handhold
pulling his legs free and dropping onto the floor
it is dark in here the features of the corridor ill defined
mulder pulls a flashlight from a pocket in his parka snicks it on
its beam reflecting off tall frozen liths of ice regularly spaced on both sides of the corridor
training the light down the corridor which curves away in both directions
then pointing it at something right in front of his nose something that gives him a start
reaching up with his hand to brush away frost from the lith
finding a man frozen in ice
naked his eyes staring into some long forgotten distance
his hair is dark his flat features familiar to us
he is the prehistoric hunter from the opening scenes of the movie
his flesh has the opaque see through quality that weve seen before
inside of which frozen along with the man is an embryonic creature
reacting to this sight then moving off down the corridor his pace quickened
low angle on the great white expanse
across which a snow tractor is moving
panning with the vehicle to
mulders snow tractor where the first tractor stops its headlights trained on mulders ride
a beat then the discovering machine moves out again following the tracks that mulder has left which brings it straight toward camera
as it passes us we can see the driver and the cigarette smoking man sitting in the cabin
as we mulder comes to the end of the dim ice corridor where soft light is penetrating through several low arched openings
mulder has to drop down to his knees to see into the openings
where mulder is seen looking toward camera
the balcony passageway is short
mulder drops to his stomach again pulling himself through toward us
when he reaches the opposite end mulder pokes his head out looking up in wonder at imagine a domed sports arena this is the scope and scale of the space
that mulder has penetrated
we see him as only a small speck on a balcony midway between floor and ceiling
pulling himself out of the balcony passageway which is like countless other passageways
which are actually ventilation ports
pulling himself to his feet
beholding the space before him
looking down to the center floor where a large central theater gives off a light different from elsewhere in the dome
an icy bright glow
leading down to the central theater far below are several large tubular spokes
one of which leads up right next to mulders position
reacting to this
then something captures his attention
there on the floor far down below is the bubble litter scully was transported in
note scullys clothes are still in the bubble litter
standing out as a rather human artifact against the otherwise dull gray bulwarks and architecture surrounding it
looks beside him where the joint that connects two sections of one of the long tube spokes is designed with an allowance a separation that might allow a man to
slip through the joint into the tube
which is what mulder does here
mulder squeezing through into the tube looking down past what looks like a chair lift like track on which the chairs are actually empty cryopod mechanisms the same structures mulder
saw in the ribbed corridor in which bodies were encased in ice
except these cryopods are empty
mulder begins to creep down toward camera picking his way around the empty cryopods
creeping away from us
heading toward where mulder pops out at the lower tube terminus
which leads into this bulwarked corridor at the base of the large stadium structure
where where mulder is walking past frozen cryopods hanging on a track
each icy pod containing a human body frozen within
partially visible behind clear blue ice
but these are modern men and women
their expressions a confused horror as if they have been somehow frozen alive
they are slowly tracking
walking along the slowly moving carousel of frozen humanity
stopping turning almost as if having sensed pushing in on mulders face
recording the horror and fear hes experiencing on seeing where a womans body is encased its naked features hidden behind the opacity of the newly frozen blue crust
but whose face is unmistakable as that of agent scullys
frozen in a similar expression of far away horror her eyes cast slightly heavenward
hurries to get his jacket unzipped
removing the felt envelope removing the syringe body the needle and the hastily putting the syringe together getting the needle poked into the soft rubber cap of the ampule
bleeding the syringe now the substance inside squirting out of the end of the needle onto the floor of the ship
and the moment it does the whole floor sizzles like water being dropped onto a hot skillet
spreading out from mulder in every direction
a violent chemical reaction as predicted by the man who gave him this substance
a moment later the entire structure mulder is in shunts
shuddering violently and setting up a low end rumble
causing mulder to accidentally drop the syringe
on the floor where the syringe hits and bounces but does not break or leak
mulder scrambling into frame to re collect it
seeing the floor where the liquid from the syringe hit where it has been etched away by the substance
where mulder crawled into the duct
condensed air is streaming out of all the ducts now
the ice and snow above beginning to melt from the force and heat of the blasting all
we can hear low end rumble and vibration
two dozen men are streaming out of the dome tents
moving to their carious snow tractors and starting the vehicles
a small exodus the tractors pulling out of camp in a rush
heading off in various directions
camera finding the cigarette smoking man moving to his tractor with the man who shot mulder
taking the last drag of his cigarette before throwing it into the snow
he stares down at it a moment as if caught in the grip of some emotion conflicting with duty
the man who shot mulder inside the tractor now throwing open the door for the csm
its all going to hell
he climbs up onto the vehicle gets in and closes the door
and the vehicle pulls away as we back on his feet smashing now at the crust of brittle blue ice that encases scully
bashing smashing and then finally breaking through the hard outer later its inner slushy contents spilling out of the puncture that exposes scullys face and shoulder
watery aqua tinted liquid drains from her mouth and nose
but scully is not conscious and there is no indication she is even alive her face frozen in a blank almost beatific expression
as he plunges the needle into scullys arm at the front of her shoulder
to which there is an immediate reaction as if given a shot of adrenalin
her eyes blinking away the cold moisture
scully scullys lips move goldfish like as she tries to suck in air an almost fearful expression overcoming her like a swimmer whos been held under too long
but no words are coming out yet
breathe can you breathe
scully is straining to do just that when liquid suddenly spews from scullys mouth
and she begins to cough and gag taking big gulps of air as her eyes focus on mulder as if on a phantom or a miracle
finally faint words ushering forth whispering breaths that mulder cannot discern
as he leans into her putting his ear up to her mouth
as the softest sound comes out in scullys frosty breath
im going to get you out of here
as she continues to suck air
the hot air blasting from the ducts is causing the ice pack above to melt and collapse
as the ice tractors head away in all directions from the domed structures
a misty fog now emanating from the seams of the domes
heat and condensation
filling with misty condensation too
the small beams of light that lighted mulders way earlier are now small shafts piercing the gathering interior cloud
illuminating frozen in his icy pod the hard semi translucent surface of which is now etched with small streams of water running to the floor
everything is melting and in motion
including the creature which is vaguely visible inside the frozen man
it turns slightly inside the body like an animal in utero
its eyes now looking at us blinking
as it presses against its own fleshy container the body of its human host
it too is filling with misty condensation
of the ice encasing the human forms sweating and melting
camera adjusting up to reveal mulder pulling scully along in a firemans carry
she is dressed now in mulders snow parka and the outer nylon pants he was wearing
scullys legs are weak beneath her
her body limp but not lifeless
mulder laboring to get her up the interior of the steep curving cylinder spoke as the air fills with mist
moving toward along the now halted cryopod carrier hanging from the transport track
mulder struggling against his own fading energy pulling scully up toward mulder pushing scully up though she seems to have at least some limited ability to do this on her
the deep low rumble we heard in the open frames of the movie reaching full volume now
the whole environment vibrating as mulder boosts scully up on the catwalk
climbing up over the prostrate body
picking her up from the floor pulling her back into the firemans carry
where the bodies are all beginning to melt
various shots of rivulets of water forming on the icy liths that encase the bodies
the water from them seeping onto the circular central floor
the condensing mist thick and swirling
where the body it houses seems to move
though as camera pushes in we see that it is the creature inside this body moving as if the heat and the defrosting are bringing the embryos to life
scullys head pokes through now as shes pushed through the opening that mulder used earlier to get into the vaulted arena
pushed in fits and starts until shes all the way through
mulder now straining and squeezing to do the same on his own
the corridor is filled with heavy condensed mist now as mulder finally slips out of the low passageway trying to get his bearing now as he huddles low over scully
turning his attention to her as she coughs hoarsely in some kind of acute spasm of pain but alive
weve got to keep moving
weakly where are we
you got me
but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa
scully is struggling now as mulder tries to pull her to her feet again
in real physical pain
scully cant finish speaking her voice becoming a hoarse cough
barely a whisper i cant go any farther
yes you can
youre going to make it scully
mulder hauling scully up off the floor away from camera now
camera moving through space in the empty corridor moving at a speed equal to mulder and scullys as they round the semi circular ribbed corridor to meet us
coming out of the mist scully back in the firemans carry
approaching the place where mulder slipped down into the corridor
mulder stopping and seeing as it too moves the embryonic creature inside it turning slightly as if coming awake
reacting to this and then to scully who suddenly starts gasping for breath
falling now from mulders grasps as her legs buckle and she goes down
her face is going red straining for air
her eyes rolling seeking relief
as mulder drops down beside her
shit but she is unable to answer
mulder hastening to unzip her his jacket
to get to her neck and find a pulse
scully mulder cannot find a pulse
scully straining harder now as mulder reaches his fingers into her mouth clearing her passageway
moving on top of her now and pumping forcefully on her chest trying to get air into her
one two three
and putting his mouth down to hers finally
breathing his life into her
pulling away from her to see that he is unsuccessful at this that scully is continuing to strain
pumping her chest again youre not dying on me now godammit godammit godammit as he pumps her chest
placing his mouth over hers again and breath breath breath
lifting his mouth from hers feeling for a pulse again putting his eat down to her mouth praying hell feel the breeze of a breath
while as it moves again more violently now
as the ice around it continues to melt and fissure
his hands going to a pocket on the inside of the jacket scully is wearing his jacket finding again the syringe that he used on scully
it is still partially full of vaccine
mulder finding this getting ready to use it when scullys body suddenly comes back to life beneath him
labored breaths which turn into a coughing spasm
mulder breaths relievedly for a moment watching scully coughing coming back to life
her eyes trying to focus on him finding him
seeing his labored relief
the panic melting away
weakly pained whisper mulder
she wants to tell him something
he leans down next to her
continued weak had you big time
mulder has but a moment to savor this weary victory though when he reacts to something that causes him to through the condensed mist he can see creatures beginning to
hatch sprouting from the melted ice encased bodies they have gestated in
their three fingered hands beating at the soft ice
their powerful feet kicking at it too
looking the other way down the corridor seeing the slushy material that makes up the inner core spilling out with them as the creatures kick out of their tombs
lifting scully up with all his strength he has left in him
hes got to get her overhead now back up the venting that he slipped down from
she is weak and of little help
mulder gets her propped up on his strength so that he can use the power of his legs to boost her toward the opening
which puts him face to face with the embryonic creature
its eye looking directly at him blinking before it goes into another fitful spasm inside its host body
where scully is boosted up toward camera
her hands reaching feebly for something to grab onto
finding a handhold
keep breathing scully
she utters something guttural unintelligible as the next thrust up from mulder gets her head and shoulders into the opening of the vent
beneath her pushing with all his might
his hands under her shoes now forcing her up into the vent like a rolled carpet into the rafters
struggling with her arms and elbows barely conscious but somehow able to manage herself forward
pushing scully up the last little way
then reaching up to find a handhold for himself
grabbing hold and lifting himself as one of his feet kicks at the ice where the creature he was just face to face with bursts from its icy pod
one hand then the other shooting out of the ice where they have broken through the host
ripping open the front of the body including the mans face
making a slimy gaping tear in what was formerly flesh
its hands grabbing at mulder as he thrashes to free himself from it getting a grip
as mulder struggles to pull himself up fighting off the creature which he cannot see beneath him
as it emerges from the ice still grasping and tearing at mulders legs with its claws
but as it bursts completely from its place mulder is able to pull himself up and into the vent in one athletic movement
lies motionless in the ducting her body forced forward by mulders in this last surging move
drawing his legs up quickly inside
not wasting a moment shoving scullys butt forward in front of him
scully you breathing
letting out another low guttural sound which strains out of her with each push forward
scullys head and arms push up through the vent where mulder first entered
the ice and snow surrounding it which had created the bubble structure have melted and fallen
so that above scullys larger hole has opened up to the surface
the air is full of condensation swirling around them
where through the swirling steam we see mulder push scully clear of the vent
climbing free himself now
when the surface they are upon shudders and quakes
as if it has come unloosed destabilized
and with this comes a mighty force of steam from the vent mulder and scully just crawled from
blasting up past them with terrible hissing force
causing mulder to throw scully away from its superheated energy
pulling her up the now climbable embankment created by the melting snow pulling her toward the surface of the ice sheet
where a wide radius of steam rises from similar and regularly spaced holes in the ice sheet defining a circular structure beneath
the white domed tents of the ice station are in the center of this dwarfed by the enormity of the melting radius
mulder pulling her up the softened and collapsed snow
the hot steam blasting up with hideous force behind them
the sound deafening
pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind them in the distance the ice station can be seen through the atmosphere of condensed air
when suddenly the ice beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away caving in to the center of the radius
which is what begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that spreads out to where mulder and scully are standing
causing mulder to realize over the din weve got to run
she is weak but is able to find her footing
dragged behind mulder as the ice behind them begins to break away falling down into an ever expanding center and sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the superheated
mulder and scully running at camera just ahead of the collapsing center
the mass of ice around them beginning to break up
steam vents erupting instantaneously everywhere
a black dome is becoming visible through the giant circle of steam in the ever widening center hole that mulder and scully are running from
which is chasing them to the edge of the radius
as mulder struggles to pull scully fast enough to outrace the icy debris that is tumbling away just behind them
large chunks falling and bouncing off the superheated surface below blown back up like water being dropped onto a hot skillet
the agents mere specks fleeing the circle of churning ice and steam
as it cascades away in three hundred and sixty degrees
from here the deafening sound if absorbed into the vastness tricking us of the reality of the massive movement of frozen material down below
as scully loses her footing falling to the ground
mulder dragging her back up to her feet though maintaining forward momentum
while behind them the thundering force of the superheated melting snow and ice is moving in on them
and then suddenly mulder and scully are gone
the radial edge of the falling snow continuing only a few feet beyond where they disappeared
the violent upheaval of snow abating but slightly
then the agents appear again
thrust upward by a rising black precipice which catapults them off its leading edge
as they fall the distance to the sheet of ice below
where the agents hit hard on the ice sheet
the rain of ice chunks pounding all around them
as the monolithic wall of the craft continues to rise
mulder trying to get to scully in this hail of debris which he shields his face from
rising faster now out of the earth as it begins to increasingly shed and break free of the frozen weight it carried
until the bottom of the edge of the wall appears lifting clear of the ice sheet and the crater that held it
where now we see the scope and shape of the ship which is breathtaking
the domed center sloping off to a gentle gradient which is the surface that mulder and scully were running on
the ship is now slowly rotating as it moves upward in a gently rising hover
mulder and scully are on the ice sheet below
scully face down on the ice
mulder lifting his head when the heavy shadow of the ship comes over them
looking up from this position to see moving slowly laterally just overhead
the dark detail of its underside visible in this angle
as it continues to rise the shadow passing over mulder and scully
scully is still face down on the ice as mulder watches the ships shadow cast over mulders snowcat which is still parked in the distance
moving up and off
the ship continues up into the antarctic sky where it rises toward the sky where it begins to get whitehot
transforming itself into pure energy
it is visible for several moments during transformation
then it disappears completely
as it does the rumble which dopplers across the white barren landscape
then it is gone
watches this then lays his head down on scullys back
he is spent at the brink of complete exhaustion
his whole body heaving
but now starting to shiver and to lose consciousness
scullys body is motionless beneath him for a moment we might believe that this is the way it might end
out here on the ice with mulder and scully freezing to death
a chill wind blows off the antarctic plain the same low rumble the only taint of silence in vastness of this literal end of the world
then scully coughs the same hoarse cough
struggling to consciousness
her head lifting slightly turning to camera
her eyes blink open and she coughs again
feeling mulders weight on top of her unaware of his condition or even where she is
there is no answer
scully struggling to pull herself out from under the weight of his body
rolling over so that her face is opposite mulders now
seeing that he has lost consciousness
finding the strength to roll him over so that she can cradle him and warm him
with the snowcat a short distance away mulder and scully in each others arms
the way it should end
longer than we would like
long enough to make us nervous then certain then angry
we fade up a prelap of the sound of a crackling fire
tracking low with men in fatigues moving along the perimeter of the corn field as they set fire to the corn stalks with small handheld butane burners
while other men in fatigues are moving between the rows dousing the furrows with accelerant
the large room filled with the evidence and debris from the bombing
it is dark
until a flashlight beam pricks the blackness moving toward us into f
carried by the man we now recognize as the man who shot mulder
he moves with directness purpose
finding what hes looking for amid the cataloged material he finds on a work bench
next to the microscope scully had used
it is the bone fragments held in an evidence container
he pockets them and exits as quiet and directly as he entered
the sky aglow with orange flames as the crops burn to the ground
we hold on this shot prelapping the sound of in light of the report ive got before me in light of the narrative im now hearing
jana cassidy sits at the head of the desk just as when we first met her
she is flanked by the other members of the review board including a
skinner who sits at the end of the table
cassidy flips through a file shes referred to before she continues
looking up with consternation as she resumes
my official report is incomplete pending these new facts im being asked to reconcile
sitting where she last sat at the small table
the seat next to her conspicuously empty
her face bears the signs of slight frostbite somewhat healed
her expression is even her attitude composed but her eyes are filled of dark restrained defiance
while there is direct evidence now that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing
the other events youve laid down here seem too incredible on their own and quite frankly implausible in their connection
panning the other board members curious bemused like cassidy
skinner shifts uncomfortably
what is it you find incredible
where would you like me to start
antarctica is a long way from dallas agent scully
i cant very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links youve made here
bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism
no they dont
most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive
i realize youre very lucky to be alive agent scully
the ordeal youve endured has clearly affected you though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to
the justice department
until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation
scully has her hand in her coat pocket now
moving around the table and approaching cassidy
removing something which she puts on the desk in front of her
a small vial
i dont believe the fbi currently has an investigation unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand
cassidy picks up the vial studying the contents of this vial the dead bee that stung scully
studying it as scully turns and moves to the door without permission no further adieu
watching scully exit
camera pivoting to include cassidy
looking at him
please ask agent scully to come back to this hearing
were not quite finished
as skinner rises unsure of the intent behind this directive we we are just above the treetops
the capitol dome is in the far distance
camera craning down to find mulder sitting by himself on a park bench
we are wide
there is no one else around
until the cigarette smoking man appears
walking through the otherwise deserted park
joining mulder on the park bench
they do not speak for several moments
a quite tension as the csm lights up a trademark smoke
then congratulations on your survival
your life is worthless now i hope you know that
derisive you think youve stopped it
what ive worked for fifty years to create
you havent stopped it
you cant stop it
takes a drag youre just one man
mulder rises from the bench heading toward camera
the csm rising watching him
as mulder continues toward us
adjust to reveal agent scully in the f
mulder moving to her as the csm watches from the distance
their eyes meet an unspoken restored bond exchanged in this moment
before mulder takes scully by the arm leads her off
leaving the csm standing alone in the distance
as we the wearer of them sporting peasant sandals
we realize shortly that while the feet are moving across sandy ground that the foliage in the near b
and that the person we are tracking with is passing row after row of stalks
revealing a tunisian man dressed in peasant clothes
he is carrying a piece of paper
moving with hasty purpose
stopping at the end of one of the long rows of corn where conrad strughold is coming toward him
making his way between rows of stalks
the peasant waits patiently as strughold approaches handing him the piece of paper
strughold reads it his otherwise steely countenance reflecting a disturbance seen only in the slight narrowing of his eyes
he looks up at the peasant and says something to him in tunisian arabic
said as command which causes the peasant to nod dutifully and move off as he came
strughold stands for a moment then crumples the paper slightly and drops it
moving off down the same corn row in which he approached
camera dropping to the ground where we find the paper on which we see a flat section that is not so crumpled we cannot read the words x files re
please camera rising now
rising up past the stalks
where we can still see strughold walking
rising up and up to reveal acres and acres of corn
many times more than we had seen previously
stretched out across the tunisian desert ending only where three white domes stand on the distant horizon
off this image we fade out
