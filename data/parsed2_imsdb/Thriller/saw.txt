written by james wan leigh whannell darkness
the soft sound of moving water can be heard in the background
from the top of the screen a tiny floating light moves its way downwards across the screen
as it passes we see just under the water part of a young mans face
his eyes are closed
the light disappears and across the darkness appears the title s a w
the title fades away
the tiny light appears again this time floating down at the end of a tub of water just near someones bare foot
the camera cuts again to the face of the young man underwater
this is adam
suddenly his eyes fly open and he comes to life opening his mouth and gasping for air
as he wakes up and struggles within the bathtub we see his foot catch on a drain plug unplugging it
the water starts to drain and we see go with the water the tiny light which we can also see has some kind of key attached to it
the room itself is pitch black but we can still just barely make him out in the dark
adam lifts himself out of the tub and falls onto the floor coughing and gasping from the shock
he manages to get to his feet but as he moves forward he realizes that his ankle is chained to something
he feels his way over to a pipe in the corner reaching down and pulling at his chain that is attached to it
he cries out his voice frantic frightened and a bit hysterical
someone help me
he stops when he hears a loud dragging sound somewhere in the room
he looks out into the darkness and calls out
is someone there
he turns back to the corner to which he is chained says in a slightly softer but still panicked voice shit im probably dead
suddenly from out within the darkness comes a mans low raspy voice
it startles adam
the voice we will soon learn belongs to lawrence
youre not dead
adam quickly turns in the direction of the voice
holding his arms out for balance he tries to look across the room to whoever is speaking but still cannot see a thing
his voice strangely a bit on the calm side and almost irritated with adams reaction to the situation
this shall be his tone for many scenes to come
theres no point in yelling i already tried it
turn on the lights
would if i could
what the fuck is going on
where am i
he turns into his corner touching the wall
i dont know yet
smelling something in disgust what is that smell
hang on a second i think i found something
with a loud click and an even louder buzzing sound the very bright fluorescent lights come to life lighting up in rows starting from lawrences end and moving towards adam
as they come on adam is nearly blinded by the sudden change from pitch black to bright white and squints in pain holding up his arms to cover his face
in the light we now see that he is in his mid twenties with short brown hair wearing a dark blue striped shirt over a white tee shirt and jeans
looking like a drowned rat from the tub
it takes him a moment but his eyes finally start to adjust and he looks around the room
he and we see lawrence who also winces from the glare of the lights standing by the light switch and the door
he is on the opposite end of the room also chained to a pipe in the corner by his foot
he wears a blue button down dress shirt now soaked with sweat stains
he is middle aged mid to late forties with pale blonde hair and even paler skin
dark circles are under his eyes
both men are barefoot
lawrences eyes adjust to the light and he sees across the room
then his gaze starts towards the center of the room as does adams who steps forward as much as he can a look of horror on his face
we see lying face down the body of a man who has blown his brains out lying in a pool of blood clad in only boxer shorts and a tee
in his left hand is a gun in his right hand is a micro cassette recorder
a gunshot and a scream are heard as the camera moves up and in a fast angle above and circling the man ending in a full overhead view of him
the shot cuts to adam who reels in shock and disgust
he turns towards the tub and leans over gagging and coughing
lawrence in the meantime hops forward the best he can studying the body with a look of fear and concern
adam stops coughing and turns back around takes another look at the body and around the room
he looks down at his chain then starts to completely freak out grabbing and pulling at his chain
he falls back onto his bottom on the floor as he yanks at the chain as hard as he can
lawrence just stands and watches him with an almost embarrassed appalled look at his behaviour
it seems that lawrence despite being in the situation hes in is above that kind of uncontrolled reaction
he speaks a bit coldly
no one can hear you
adam stops pulling at the chain stands up and looks to lawrence his breathing fast and heavy
his voice is not yelling anymore but still just as hysterical
what the fuck is this
calm down just calm down
he knows that to remain calm is to remain in control something he must be no matter what the situation
are you hurt
adam looks down at himself shrugging slightly
i dont know
lawrence moves over to the pipe in the corner leaning against it for support
calmly whats your name
sarcastic my name is very fucking confused
demanding whats your name
whats going on here
internal eye roll hes getting more and more aggravated with adams behaviour my name is lawrence gordon im a doctor
i just woke up here just like you
he reaches up wipes his face with his sleeve adam kneels back down facing the pipe pulling at his chains once more but not with his prior panic
he winces at the metal biting into his skin
in pain ah
lawrence looks at adam with a look that seems to say im stuck in here with this guy
he then glances down at the body
adam continues to pull at his chains does not and will not look at the body just shakes his head
trying to get something out of this kid well do you have any idea how you got here
whats the last thing you remember
he sits back onto the floor stops pulling at his chains for a moment
i went to bed in my shithole apartment and woke up in an actual shithole
he raises his left leg slightly starts trying to pull his foot out of the iron cuff
he glances to lawrence who has moved over to the wall to his left bent over slightly and resting a hand against a pipe
so what about you huh
he shrugs slightly shaking his head
theres not much to tell really
across the room adam gives up with the chain for the time being but remains sitting on the floor
i was on my way home from work and uh i dont remember anything else
adam just sits there glancing over to the body and then focusing on it much more
the initial panic has worn off for now replaced simply with fear and shock
his voice is a bit softer
first dead body ive ever seen
look different in real life
they dont move
lawrence slowly lowers himself into a sitting position against the wall
he pokes slightly at the iron cuff around his foot
from the looks of these chains someone didnt want us to go very far either
suddenly adam leaps up lifting up his shirt and exposing his abdomen
his panic is back but not at full force like before
he studies himself then glances to lawrence
can you see any scars
looking at him strangely what
this is what they do man he gestures to his stomach where there are in fact no scars
they kidnap you and drug you and before you know it youre in a bathtub and your kidneys are on ebay
a ridiculous theory to us and to lawrence but adam states it with conviction
a scoffing tone in his voice no one has taken your kidneys
disbelief how can you tell from way over there
matter of fact because youd either be in terrible agony or youd be dead by now
what are you a surgeon
he lowers his shirt and turns and bends down to prod at the chain around the pipe again
hes getting tired of adam already
he speaks sharply
so you gonna tell me your name or what
adam stands back up turns to lawrence his voice once again calm
getting to his feet his voice a bit calmer well adam what we need to do he leans with one hand outstretched against the pipe to his right
adam watches him scared but calm is start thinking about why were here
whoever brought us there couldve killed us by now
but they didnt
they must want something from us
he looks up and around the room question is what
he sees something up on the wall moves forwards a bit towards it
we see that it is a brand new clock on the wall ticking away
it reads currently at
what about it
its brand new
squints studying it not getting what hes implying so
sighs its quite simple why cant adam see it
so someone obviously wanted us to know the time
adam looks a bit confused still mulls over that information
lawrence thinks for a moment
wait i think i may be able to reach that door
lawrence moves over as far as the chain will allow him to the giant wooden sliding door pushing against it as hard as he can
in the meantime we see adam thinking
he pauses then reaches down and starts going through his pockets
there is nothing in the front two but in his back left pocket he pulls out a plastic baggie with a white envelope in it
he unfolds the baggie the envelope says adam
he stares at it in his hands wondering what it is
lawrence continues struggling with the door quickly glances over his shoulder to see what adam is doing
he sees adam holding the baggie
adam reaches into the envelope pulls out a micro cassette tape
a close up shows the words play me written on the tape label
adam holds it in his hand studying it
lawrence turns away from the door looking over and trying to see what adam has in his hand
what is that
adam doesnt answer continues looking at the tape
lawrences voice grows impatient
glances up briefly at lawrence then back down at the tape
his voice sounds slightly surprised
its a tape
where did you find it
it was in my pocket
lawrence thinks about that briefly then starts digging through his own pockets finds within them a white envelope with lawrence written across it in the same black lettering as adams
regarding his tape it says play me
lawrence tears into his envelope empties the contents into the palm of his hand
first he holds up a similar tape to adams
it also says play me
then he holds up a single bullet studying it not sure what its there for yet
then he holds up a tiny key
he bends over gets down on the floor and starts to try to unlock his chains with the key
it doesnt seem to be working
frustrated mumbling to himself and to the key come on come on come on
seeing that it doesnt seem to be working on lawrences lock throw it over here
lawrence gives him a slightly mistrustful look but then holds up the key and throws it
adam misses the key at first as it hits the floor in front of the dirty toilet near his corner
he leans over and picks up the key then bends down and tries the key on the lock on his ankle which doesnt work
he tries the lock on the chains around the pipe
it isnt working there either
watching him no
adam gives up drops the key onto the floor frustratedly shaking his head
thats when he looks over to the body again and the shot closes up on the hand holding the tape recorder
a small loop handle juts out of the hands grip
adam stands up then bends down and picks up the tape on the floor looking at it
he puts it back down then stretches himself flat out on the floor trying to reach
unfortunately there is still a good three to four feet between him and the body
use your shirt
gets back up to his knees what
adam looks down at himself then takes off the long sleeved blue shirt
he lays back down holding the shirt by the ends of each sleeve and throws it trying to catch it on the tape recorder
he tries a second time same result
adam tries again it misses
it is just barely reaching
he pulls the shirt back gets back up on his knees aggravated
it wont work
trying to get him to not give up yet well look around there must be something else you can use
stands ready to give up skeptical theres nothing
insistent well there must be something
adam looks around his area then into the bathtub
he sees something bends over takes out the tub plug which is attached to a long cord
he ties the cord around the sleeve of his shirt
he kneels down holding out the shirt aiming
come on you can do it
adam throws it attempting to get the plug through the loop at the end of the tape recorder
come on come on again
he tries again and misses
on the third try however he gets the plug right through the loop
lawrence smiles in relief
adam very slowly pulls it back dragging the tape recorder along the floor towards him
he picks it up getting rid of the plug and dropping it and the shirt on the floor
he picks up the tape pops it in and presses play holding the tape recorder out a bit so that they can both hear but keeping his head tilted so
he can hear better
a chilling deep raspy sinister male voice the jigsaw killer comes from the tape
as it speaks adams expression is fearful but the thought how does he know
can be detected
on tape rise and shine adam
youre probably wondering where you are
ill tell you where you might be
you might be in the room that you die in
up until now you simply sat in the shadows watching others live out their lives
but what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror
now i see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic
but mostly just pathetic
so are you going to watch yourself die today adam
or do something about it
end adam looks frightened but not sure of the entire meaning of the message
i dont get it
he presses the stop button on the tape
throw me the player
pauses thinks no you throw me your tape
a heavy sigh
he looks at adam as a slow minded fool who simply doesnt understand the full capacity of the situation that theyre in and speaks to him as such
look were going to have to work together if we want to get out of here
now just throw it to me
picks up on the tone speaks defensively im not going to risk breaking it
you throw me your tape
lawrence pauses looking at adam as though hed like to smack him then holds up and tosses the tape
it hits the floor behind adam who kneels down and picks it up pops it in presses play
its the same chilling voice as on adams tape
as the tape plays adam stares at lawrence and lawrence at the tape recorder
on tape dr
gordon this is your wake up call
every day of your working life you have given people the news that they are going to die soon
now you will be the cause of death
your aim in this game is to kill adam
adam glances down at the tape recorder wide eyed then back up at lawrence you have until six on the clock to do it
there sa man in the room with you
when theres that much poison in your blood another view of the body from lawrences pov the only thing left to do is shoot yourself
jigsaw coughs there are ways to win this hidden all around you
just remember x marks the spot for the treasure
if you do not kill adam by then alison and diana will die dr
and ill leave you in this room to rot
let the game begin
end the looks on each mans face clearly say oh shit
the tape ends
lawrence stands up
firmly give me that
adam tosses him the tape
he catches it rewinds plays back
adam stands up from his spot on the floor
then alison and diana will die dr
and ill leave you in this room to rot
thinking trying to figure this out any idea who that is
on tape let the game begin
he knows us
wait a minute
rewinds more false hope what do you think
probably a joke right
presses play on tape let the game begin
on tape in a very hushed tone after a brief silence
follow your heart
lawrence stops the tape
what the hell does follow your heart mean
lawrence is looking around on the walls and everywhere else in the bathroom for a heart
he spots a small one drawn in brown on the toilet next to adam and points
right next to you on the toilet
adam looks sees the toilet
slowly he bends down resting his hands on the seat looking down into the bowl of liquid shit not really sure what hes looking for
impatient gesturing come on come on
adam glances up at lawrence with a look of youve got to be kidding me but lawrence watches him expectantly
adam sighs then reaches in with his right hand fishing around in the mess
he gasps making gagging sounds his face turned away from the bowl
he coughs fishes around for another brief moment then quickly pulls back trying to shake some of the shit off of his hand spitting
disgusted no solids
take off the lid
he points to the lid
adam looks to it slowly stands up reaches for it
lawrence has no patience
adam takes off the lid places it down on the toilet seat
the water is clearer inside and he reaches in and pulls out something wrapped up in a black garbage bag
he holds it up for lawrence to see turns to him
i really wish i had checked in there first
he smiles slightly what is it
adam tears into the bag reaches in and pulls out two hacksaws
he drops the bag on the floor bends down and takes up his chain holding one of the hacksaws and beginning to saw at the chain with it
lawrence watches him for a moment
adam turns and looks
lawrence speaks in an irritated voice mind passing me the other one
adam reaches over and picks up the other hacksaw then carefully throws it across the room
it hits the pipe to lawrences left
lawrence reaches down and picks it up then sits down on the floor
quick shot back to adam who while lawrence is preoccupied with picking up the hacksaw quickly picks up the garbage bag and tosses it into the bathtub
both men start to saw away at their chains furiously but neither are making any progress
suddenly adams saw snaps in the middle and his temper flares
he reacts violently hitting the broken saw twice against the iron pipe then turns and hums it across the room right into a mirror
a small piece of the mirror breaks off and flies to the floor
lawrence glances over at what adam has done then goes back to sawing for another moment
adam sits back down breathing heavily leaning against the pipe in his corner
finally lawrence gives up turning and sitting with his back against the pipe also breathing heavily for a moment
he sits there when a look of realization comes across his face
he holds up the saw looking at it understanding
he lowers it to the floor shaking his head slightly
everything is becoming more clear now he doesnt want us to cut through our chains
he wants us to cut through our feet
adam looks up at him eyebrows raised
i think i may know whos done this to us
what did you say
he stands up is lawrence hiding something from him
its not someone i know personally
just someone i know of
getting slightly frantic again jesus christ
tell me who is it
the camera closes up on lawrences face
to the right of it the screen is fading into a flashback of a crime scene
as lawrence speaks his face fades and the flashback scene grows clearer until it is only the crime scene with three detectives walking down a flight of stairs
the last i heard
the police still hadnt caught him
we now see the three figures descending through a trap door down a flight of stairs
the lighting is a bright lime green that is strangely dark at the same time
the trio enters a small cell like room with a low ceiling
they are tapp sing and kerry
tapp is a tall black man in his late forties early fifties
sing is an asian man in his mid to late thirties and kerry is a caucasian woman in her mid to late thirties with long curly brown hair that is
tied back in a ponytail
all are well dressed sing and tapp in suits the woman in a jacket and dress slacks
they are the detectives working on this case
as they move into the room sing sees something that brings a look of shock to his face shining a flashlight on it
we cannot see it yet
vo and the only reason i know that is because i was a suspect
tapp comes into the room last ducking slightly from his height and comes up alongside sing looking at the same thing
vo ill start from the beginning
this ones not fresh anymore
at least three weeks out
detective tapp squints as he peers in and studies the body victims a year old male
quick flash of a crime scene photo a closeup of behind the mans head and upper back
there are deep cuts all over
the camera cuts upwards to the detectives
died of massive blood loss
mostly through the femoral artery
the camera pans around to detective tapp who moves around the side fo the cage to get a better look inside shining his flashlight in
he started at the back of the cage and tunneled his way through the razor wire so fast its amazing he got as far as he did
cut himself so deep we found traces of stomach acid on the floor
another more gruesome crime scene photo shot of the body from the side we can see the razor wire digging in under his arm
also a close up shot of some of his wounds long deep cuts
we also found this
she holds up an evidence baggie with a micro cassette tape recorder just like the one adam and lawrence found in their cell
she presses the play button and tapp and sing listen
its the same chilling voice from adam and lawrences tapes
on tape hello paul
you are a perfectly healthy sane middle class male
yet last month you ran a straight razor across your wrists
did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die or did you just want some attention
tonight youll show me
the irony is that if you want to die you just have to stay where you are
but if you want to live youll have to cut yourself again
flashback shot of paul waking up in the cage looking around scared and confused
the shots go back and forth between the detectives and the paul flashback with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire screaming
his screams sound distant under jigsaws voice
find the path through the razor wire to the door
at that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb
how much blood will you shed to stay alive paul
end stopping the tape the door was on a timer
it was unlocked until
then it slammed shut
he was given two hours
cut back to detective tapp who notices something and shines his light on it
we see a strange wound on pauls body a piece of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece
sing looks in as well see it
there is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound
i think were gonna be here for a while sing
sing looks to him
we get another quick crime scene shot of paul
vo the newspapers started calling him the jigsaw killer
cut back to lawrence in the bathroom
for his next two spoken lines the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives in the razor wire room
actually technically speaking hes not really a murderer
he never killed anyone
sing wearing gloves gets in the cage and examines pauls body a bit
a flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown
more gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen
vo he finds ways for his victims to kill themselves
cut to sing kneeled down over a charred corpse completely blackened at another crime scene
we hear jigsaws voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detectives look around and over the flashback shots
vo on tape hello mark
if youre so sick then why do i have so many photos of you up and about
there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of mark up and about looking around and getting into a car
lets put your so called illness to the test
flashback image of mark waking up
he is a younger man in his mid to late twenties with dark brown hair
he is completely nude smeared in some kind of vaseline like ointment
in front of him is a small square glass plate held up by some chains
on the plate is a micro cassette player a lit votive candle and a box of matches
he gets up looking around confusedly and scared
right now there is a slow acting poison in your veins
the antidote is in the safe
black and white crime scene shot of the safe then a shot of mark standing over it screaming his screams distant under jigsaws voice as with paul
the combination to the safe quick montage of several black and white crime scene photos of numbers written all over the walls is written on the wall
hurry up and program it in
but watch your step marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor
and by the way thats a flammable substance smeared on your body shot of mark looking at the ointment on his hand up his arm everywhere so i would be
careful with that candle if i were you
huddled over the safe screams but it is still distant sounding help
or all the people youve burned with your act mark starts to turn the lock on the safe just might have their revenge
we see mark desperately going around the room holding the candle looking at the walls trying to find a combination
the camera goes back and forth a few times in a sped up shot to him doing this and turning a the lock on the safe trying to program the
combination into the safe
he moves in a circle clockwise to us
when he gets to facing right in front of us the flame from the candle flares up and engulfs the shot flaring into a close up crime scene photo of
marks charred face
the shot moves back to the trio of detectives with sing holding the tape recorder
i found something else
well two things actually
she moves past them and we go with her over to a wall where there is a small hole cut about an inch or two in diameter
the light from the outside shines in
there was someone standing outside here watching through this peephole
looks like our friend jigsaw likes to book himself front row seats to his own sick little games
he was there at the last one as well
she walks over to sing and tapp only this time he left us his penlight
she holds up the penlight in an evidence baggie clicking it twice then handing it to tapp
taking the baggie studying it get a rush on the prints
he hands it back to her
taking the baggie moving out of the room copy that
lawrence in his white doctors coat along with three blue scrub clad medical students
a nurse in white stands off to the side
lawrence is going over the patients charts
he goes over to the x ray display pushing the light on to view two x rays of someones skull
he points to it with his pen as he speaks
this patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumor extending across the midline
started as colon cancer
he turns back to the three young medical students
one of them a pretty asian girl named carla smiles at lawrence as he speaks seems particularly infatuated with him
the patient has come in for a standard checkup by which we are able to monitor the rate at which his condition is declining
in the doorway an orderly pushing a cart of cleaning supplies is passing by and stops when he sees lawrence and the medical students in the room listening to what
lawrence is saying
this is zep
hes a man in his early to late forties dressed in orderly whites with short brown hair and large blue eyes that show a kindness that the others in the
room seem to be lacking
kindness and something else below the surface
he glances down at john sleeping then up at lawrence
the patient had
cutting him off his name is john dr
he looks down at the patient who we see is a man in his late forties early fifties hairless except for a small white goatee
his head is to the side and he is sleeping
on the tray table in front of him is a notebook and some colored pencils
as zep looks at him and speaks of him there is caring in his voice something dr
gordon has yet to display regarding this patient
hes a very interesting person
lawrence looks almost slightly embarrassed not for himself but maybe for zep
a condescending smug smile plays across his face and he nods
his tone matches his look
thank you for that information zep
he looks to the students who all share his smug smile as you can see our orderlies form very special bonds with the patients
zep just stares at lawrence his expression mostly blank but with pure loathing just underneath the surface
the look seems to say fuck you dr
he stares at him for a moment then turns away and continues down the hall with his cart
continuing on the patient
but he is cut off by a voice on the intercom
lawrence gordon please page the operator
a smug but annoyed smirk obviously someone doesnt want me to tell you what the patient has
he steps around the students leaves the room
the three students watch after him with great admiration
cut to lawrences office at the hospital
inside tapp is leaning against dr
gordons chair studying the various framed degrees on the wall
sing is sitting in one of the two chairs across from the desk twisted around in his seat to look at a couple of small picture frames on the bookshelf
lawrence opens the door and enters and the two detectives turn to look at him
he removes his white coat and hangs it on a rack by the door
tapp speaks first his tone is friendly but searching
gordon im detective tapp this is detective sing city homicide
he gestures to the degrees on the wall
lawrence smiles pretending to care about what they think truly just wanting to get this over with so as to not waste any more of his time
as he speaks he walks over to the chair behind his desk
thank you i do my best
he sits in his chair
tapp takes the seat next to sing across from him
sing studies him silently chewing gum
sorry to interrupt you while youre working
now how can i help you gentlemen
tapps tone turns a bit more serious but still amiable enough
are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of p
last night doctor
his tone just barely masking his concern why is it that youre interested
wed like to ask you a few questions about it
for your sake i think its best if we do it down at the station
would you like to follow us there
shaking his head this is unbelievable no im afraid thats
thats quite out of the question
i cant just leave i have work to do
plus my wife has the car today so
amiable but hinting that he knows something oh thats okay you can ride with us
chuckles uncomfortably im sorry youll have to tell me again
what is this all about
tapp produces the penlight from his pocket holds it up for dr
is this yours doctor
he puts the penlight down on the desk
lawrence picks it up a brief oh shit look flashing across his face only to be quickly covered up
he looks at the pen strangely
the two detectives carefully study his reaction
lawrence looks back up at them
cut to the police station
in an interrogation room lawrence paces back and forth nervously now wearing his suit jacket
his lawyer sits at the table taking notes
so you have no idea how your penlight showed up at the murder scene
of course not
i have to ask
what were you doing last night
a slight hesitation a bit of guilt in his voice
as much as he would allow
i was seeing someone
a slight pause who
lawrence doesnt answer just continues his pacing
the lawyer gets frustrated noisily puts down his pen
look if you cant be honest with me
his tone quick almost blurting i was visiting someone
it wasnt a patient
he sighs shakes his head
hes fucked either way
what am i gonna do
well as your lawyer and your friend my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now
because no one is going to believe you later
cut back to the bathroom
lawrence still sitting against the wall throws down his hacksaw next to him resting his hand against his knee
sighs that was five months ago
he tried to set me up for murder
cut back to the interrogation room some time later
lawrence is sitting alone at the table
sing comes through the door shuts it behind him
we checked your alibi
it holds up
his voice indicates that he still believes theres more to it he does not and will not trust lawrence
can i go home now
continuing we have one of the victims who managed to escape
as he speaks we see a young woman with brown hair in a ponytail wearing a visitors pass being led carefully into the room next to them and sat at
this is amanda
lawrence and sing can see her clearly she cannot see them
want to know if you wouldnt mind sticking around and listening to her testimony
maybe itll trigger something
tapp and an unidentified bald black man in a suit enter the room
the man guides amanda into her chair stands behind her against the wall
tapp sits in a chair to her left
doesnt really care id like to help really but
cutting him off quickly wont let him out of this that easily well wed really appreciate it
shes the only one who made it
quietly giving in
camera moves into the interrogation room with amanda tapp and the unidentified man
as tapp speaks the camera slowly moves closer over his shoulder and towards amanda
as we get closer to her we see long strange scar like markings along each side of her mouth
she is shaken her eyes distant never looking anyone including tapp in the eye
it is clear that her mind is still lost somewhere within her nightmare
speaking slowly gently amanda
in your own time tell me the first thing you remember
we move closer and closer to amanda then suddenly the camera spins round quickly and snaps into an alternate view of her her flashback
the room she is in has the same lime green lighting as pauls cell
amanda sits in a chair wearing a strange iron contraption around her head a bear trap like device covering her mouth
we can see her eyes surrounded with black eyeliner as they slowly open groggy just waking up
vo i woke up
all i could taste was blood
the camera moves back quickly and we see her tied to the chair her wrists bound to the arms of the chair
she pulls against her bonds moaning loudly trying to speak or cry out but cannot
she continues to struggle against her bonds some more
the camera circles around her and we get a better view of the strange device on her head and the padlock and timer on the back of it
a long wire hangs down from the timer and below the screen
the view switches to the side of her and we see next to her an old television set which suddenly switches on startling her
after a brief moment of static the frightening image of a demented clown like doll its face white with red spirals on its cheeks its red eyes leering at amanda
from the screen
she stares at it her moans a bit softer to match her fear and utter confusion
the doll speaks the jaw moving it is the voice of jigsaw
from the tv hello amanda
you dont know me but i know you
i want to play a game
heres what happens if you lose
the video moves next to the doll to a device like the one shes wearing attached to a mannequin head
as he continues explaining what it is her breathing grows faster and heavier and her moans pick up more
the device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws
when the timer at the back goes off your mouth will be permanently ripped open
think of it like a reverse bear trap
here ill show you
the video pans back to a view of the doll and the device
the dolls head moves and looks down at the device and the camera zooms in on it
a timer ticks away
a few seconds later snap
the device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes
amanda shrieks her eyes widening
the video switches back to a close up of the doll
from the tv there is only one key to open the device
its in the stomach of your dead cellmate
look around amanda
know that im not lying
you better hurry up
live or die
make your choice
the video goes to white and gray static then switches off
amanda begins to struggle like a madwoman against her bonds and the chair
the camera swings around her circling making her movements fast and jerky
amanda manages to pull one arm free then the other and stands up quickly
thats when the cord in the back of the device is pulled out and the timer starts
she freezes her eyes widening
we see a close up of the timer and it begins its sixty second countdown
she reaches behind her head pulling at the lock and the timer trying to pull it off but it is stuck there
she starts freaking out pulling at it as much as she can the camera movements once again fast and jerky around her
the camera spins back to amanda sitting still in her chair in the interrogation room sniffling
we see a brief shot of lawrence who watches and listens to her with grim amazement
back to amanda
and then i saw the body
we switch back into amandas cell
over her shoulder we see near the corner the body of a man lying on the floor on his back
amanda cautiously approaches it the timer still ticking away her hands still at the device
she kneels down cautiously next to him
she reaches down and with a shaking hand lifts up his shirt revealing a large black question mark drawn on his abdomen
she sobs harder hunched over him
quick cut to the interrogation room amanda in the center of the shot
there was a knife
back to the cell
amanda still leaning over picks up a small knife next to the body
she slowly brings it up in both of her shaking hands clutching it
she looks closer at it
a quick shot of the timer shows it to be at seconds now almost halfway
the camera moves to a shot of the mans face when
he opens his eyes and starts to wake up
he moans unable to speak or move
his eyes slowly groggily look around a bit
he cannot even open his mouth someone has very heavily drugged him
he sees amanda over him with a knife and his eyes widen he tries to moan at her to stop to not do what shes about to do but she
turns the knife upside down in both hands and quickly stabs down
he moans in agony in the background as she stabs down again and again and again
blood splashes on her hands
a quick shot back of lawrence as he listens his mouth open slightly eyes wide staring at her
cut back to amanda in the cell as she stabs down a few more times
then back again to the table in lawrences interrogation room
sing throws down an evidence baggie with a used syringe in it
vo as camera pans up to lawrence hed been injected with an opiate overdose
he couldnt move or feel much of anything
he was alive
staring nods slightly was
back to amandas interrogation room her head still hung still sniffling
a view of tapp as he asks what happened after you took it off
cut back to the cell her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key
cut back to interrogation room amanda then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ
back to interrogation room amanda the horror on her face growing then back to the cell
amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes holding
she reaches around the back of her head quickly trying to unlock the padlock
the timer ticks away faster and faster
she gets it pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open
she lets out the most terrible agonized heart wrenching scream sobbing loudly her hands held out in front of her rocking back and forth
suddenly from another corner of the room a light comes on revealing the puppet from the video in the corner
amanda sees it staring at it wide eyed her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it
slowly it wheels towards her on a tricycle
she can only stare and cry not sure what to do or expect
it stops leering at her then speaks
you are still alive
most people are so ungrateful to be alive
but not you
cut back into a close up of amanda in the interrogation room her head still shaking a bit almost like a series of slight spasms
she continues to sniffle her eyes far off
cut to tapp
you are in fact a drug addict
isnt that right mandy
she nods but doesnt look up
do you think that is why he picked you
she lets out a sob briefly nodding once
are you grateful mandy
she finally raises her head looking into his eyes for the first time
as she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily tapp looks over his shoulder into lawrences room right in his direction
he may not see him but he knows hes there
the camera then cuts back to amanda who starts sobbing more heavily again
slowly the camera moves down into and under the table fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where lawrence and adam are
adam sits in his corner staring down at the floor as he has been listening to lawrences story
he looks up across to lawrence
softly are you sure its him
nods slightly yeah im sure
becoming a little hysterical again
he speaks accusingly how do i know youre telling the truth
you can be the one who put me in this room
he gesticulates as he speaks pointing to lawrence and himself
internal eye roll speaks slowly as to a simpleton im in exactly the same situation youre in
he stands up kicking his chained foot out
youve got one thing i dont information
he hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose pointing you know who did this
he picks up a glass shard that fell when he broke the mirror holds it up threateningly to lawrence now you either tell me what is really going on lawrence
rolls his eyes turns his head over to his left away from adam or ill cut you with this you hear me
ill cut but he stops short as he sees something in the glass
he flips it over studying it flips it back
he looks over to the mirror on the wall studying it thinking
lawrence notices that adams ranting has ended glances over at him
looks over at lawrence then back at the mirror
its a two way mirror
adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully then reaches over to the corner behind him leaning down and picking up a loose padlock
he lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror shattering most of the glass
lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering
adam reaches back down finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force
the rest of the glass breaks away and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass
lawrence stands up to get a better look at it
we movie in closer to the camera getting a better look at it as well
suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy black and white surveillance video of lawrence and adam in the bathroom staring right at
us into the camera
the shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor
a partial view of other recording type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor
a mans voice speaks though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the jigsaw tapes
as he speaks a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen
os taunting i can see you
from on video so thats what this is
still taunting sounds as though on a power trip dont look at me
i cant help you
the shot transitions from the video view of adam back into regular view in the bathroom
adam stands in a threatening pose to the camera speaks angrily loudly to it his voice dripping with sarcasm
can you hear me in there
im having a blast
he bends down and picks up another piece of debris from the floor this is the most fun ive had without lubricant
hums the piece of debris at the window
it makes a thwacking sound but doesnt break
not even a crack
make sure youre getting everything
bends down throws picks up and throws another piece of debris
it hits but no breakage
leans down for another piece
scoffing tone as he watches adam trying to break the glass thats not going to do anything
pauses looks to lawrence you just want to leave it running on us
the shot switches to surveillance view very matter of fact well you wont stop it
shot switches to regular view thats why we cant cut through these chains
its why you wont break that glass
he gestures to the pipe then the glass every possible angle has been pre thought out by him
he appears deep in thought starting to understand the set up more so figuring out the way this guy thinks
almost admiring him
the situation may be bad but its a brilliant design
you sound like you admire this prick
explaining to overcome something you have to understand what a perfect engine it is
thats how you fight disease
he looks up at the ceiling at the walls around the room now the tape told us to find an x
that x has to be somewhere in this room
determined help me find it
adam does not help him look
he simply cannot believe lawrences calm demeanor in this situation anymore
it seems that he is almost becoming as sick of lawrences attitude as lawrence is of his
he speaks a with a bit of a hyper tone again accusingly
how can you be the calm doctor guy when your wife and kid are out there
shot of lawrence looking around the room hes got them too
shot of the clock its now
he could be doing anything to them right now
are you thinking about that
suddenly looks right at him snaps angrily i am thinking about that
adam backs off a bit
lawrence pauses a moment his voice changes to calm but sad
ive been the last thing i said to my daughter
lawrence turns away from adam placing his hand on the pipe behind him and the shot moves up into blackness then up at the foot of a little girls bed
in a darkened bedroom
the little girl is diana
shes about or years old with long wavy light brown hair
she lays tucked in with her eyes closed her favourite teddy bear wrapped in her left arm
the camera moves up and over her a bit moving in closer to her
chimes can be heard tinkling very faintly against a soft breeze
as the shot pauses just above her her eyes suddenly open blinking away sleepiness
she sits up pulling away the covers still holding her teddy bear
she remains sitting in her bed staring over into the dark corner to her right
the chimes jingle away
we move in closer to her face something has her spooked
a clock ticking is suddenly heard as the image fades from diana getting out of bed into a strange mechanical looking clock on the living room wall of the gordon
the shot lowers and we see the nicely furnished living room of the gordon home
the walls are a dark crimson red the furniture in tones of red and brown
it definitely is the living room of a well off family
not too cold but not as warm and homey as it could be
diana slowly makes her way across the living room towards her parents bedroom moving almost dream like her teddy bear hanging limply from her right hand
she moves to the frosted glass double doors of her parents room opening them both into the bedroom where we see her mother alison laying on her side fast asleep
alison is in her early to mid thirties with long blond hair going just past her shoulders and very pretty despite her sleepiness and messy hair in this scene
diana moves into the room standing next to the bed saying nothing just watching her mother sleeping
alisons eyes slowly open the feeling of being watched plus the instincts of a mother have awoken her
she reaches over and turns on the light looking upon her daughter with concern
diana honey are you okay
she pushes back the covers and gets up crouching down in front of her daughter
looking up at her she places her hands on her daughters arms
diana honey can you hear me
very softly but showing almost no fear mommy
alison reaches up and touches dianas hair bringing her hand down in a soft caress on dianas cheek
oh what is it sweet pea
very calmly theres a man in my room
sighing but not rudely
this is not the first time this has happened oh honey are you sure hes not just hiding in your imagination
he talked to me
sighs okay ill come and check your room
she smiles a small assuring smile i want daddy
hell get the scary man
her smile fading a bit alright if you want
she stands and leads diana out of the room
cut to lawrences office
lawrence sits hunched slightly over his laptop computer focused on some paper hes writing
diana and alison appear in the doorway to his left
he doesnt even look up just keeps typing
alisons tone when she speaks indicates that she knows hell probably say no or put it off on her
larry sorry to bother you but your daughter had a bad dream again
his eyes never leaving the screen raises his finger to pause them just a minute
she wants you to check her room
keeps typing never looks up mmm hmm mmm hmm just gotta finish this paragraph
alison waits a moment then turns to diana
softly you know what sweetie
ill go check with you
they turn slowly start to walk away as lawrence quickly finishes typing then closes the laptop
he smiles turning to look at them
cut to dianas room
lawrence reaches over and turns on the lamp on dianas side table
diana lies in bed slightly propped up against her pillows and stuffed animals
lawrence sits on the side of her bed
very reassuringly see
he pulls the covers up over her up to her chest
theres no one in your room
theres no such thing as the bad man
now can you go to sleep
im still scared
give me your tootsie
he pulls back the covers and she pulls out her foot
he takes it in his hand
oh what a big tootsie
he turns to her raising his eyebrows up remember this one
he counts on her toes as he says the following this little piggy went to market this little piggy stayed home this little piggy had roast beef this little piggy
had none and this little piggy went weeee
he tickles up her leg to her tummy and she giggles all the way home
just then lawrences beeper goes off
he leans back takes it out and looks at it
i hate that thing
well i have to go to work sweetheart
you know what daddys job is like
now come on
he re tucks her in she smiles at him
try and get some sleep now okay
he gives her a kiss smiles stands up and goes to the door
youre not going to leave us are you daddy
suddenly concerned what
he stops at the door turns goes back over to her bed sits down next to her and leans over
this was the last thing hed expected her to say what are you talking about
you mean leave you and mommy
she nods he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face
no no sweetheart i would never do that
who gave you that idea
well its not true okay
very softly okay
how much do i love you
he moves his face closer to her and together they say love you very much thats right thats right
he gives her a kiss pulls back
good night sweetie
good night daddy
lawrence gets up and goes to the door flipping the lights off
he pauses before he steps out
tomorrow ill read you your favourite story
with a small smile okay
he goes out
quick cut to the entrance hall of the gordon residence
lawrence walks towards the door alison behind him
alisons voice starts to cut over the scene
her tone is very pissed off
i dont know how much longer i can do this larry
sounds as though he has no idea what she means what what are you talking about
pissed in disbelief how can you walk through life pretending that youre happy
i am happy
confrontational that is complete bullshit
cut to a shot of diana laying on her side in her darkened room clutching her teddy bear to her chest
her eyes are open she can hear everything
we stay with her for the rest of alisons line her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible id rather you break down and tell
me that you hated me
at least thered be some passion in it
would you like to see her
he reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet throws it across the room to adam who is sitting with his back against the wall facing lawrence
adam picks up the wallet and opens it
he sees two pictures of diana side by side
the one on the left is diana hugging a dog
the one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere
sighs then looks up at lawrence you gonna have any more kids
a bit wearily but not snobby weve talked about it but uh with our schedules its difficult enough to concentrate on one
the tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and attention to his daughter
referring to the wallet so wheres the lucky wife
a small smile theres another picture behind the one youre looking at
adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out
lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks its my favourite one because were all in it together
someone usually me has to hold the camera which means im always missing from the photos
cut to adam looking at the picture he pulled out
his face is blank but you can sense great disturbance behind it
cut to a shot of the photo he is holding
it is not the one lawrence described but a polaroid of alison and diana bound and gagged and the message regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it
he turns the photo over and there is a message
as he reads it jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover
vo x marks the spot
sometimes you see more with your eyes shut
adam does his best to hide what he has seen looks up to lawrence
its uh its not here
a slight disturbance from his momentary nostalgic bliss what
uh this photo youre talking about
its not here
slightly surprised reaching out his hand for adam to toss the wallet
are you sure
tucking the picture in his right hand he shifts slightly by lifting himself a bit with his right hand sneakily putting the photograph down and tossing the wallet with his
lawrence picks up the wallet and starts looking for it creasing his brow in concern while adam backs up against his wall holding the photograph out of lawrences sight against
a pipe he rests his arm on as he looks at the photograph
disbelief shaking his head he
he mustve taken it
alisons voice over is heard as he says this and continues to look through the wallet and we hear alisons voiceover from the scene in the main hall
vo how can you walk through life pretending that youre happy
cut to the main hall of the gordon residence back to the earlier flashback of lawrence and alison
this time we stay with them
i am happy
he walks over to a chair leaning over it as he puts something down gets his briefcase ready to go to work
alison stands a few feet behind him trying her best to get him to react to stop the bullshit and end the masquerade
pissed that is complete bullshit
id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me
at least thered be some passion in it
tired of this brushing it off as not that important like there really is nothing wrong we can talk about this alter okay
he leans in to kiss her but she shakes her head
he pauses there
firmly just leave
he looks at her for a moment searching then slowly turns away and heads out the door
goodnight little girl
camera pans up closer into the closet and we a widened blue eye and part of a face yet unidentifiable watching her
the closet doors burst open and diana screams
cut back to the main hall where alison stands alone her head lowered slightly
as soon as she hears the scream she turns and bolts towards her daughters room
alison gets to just outside the door to her bedroom
opens the door and flips on the light gasps when she sees a figure covered by a blanket looming over dianas bed
the figure suddenly grabs diana and she screams struggling against him
alison goes for them
quick cut to now in alison and lawrences bedroom
waistline shot of a figure wearing a black coat black leather gloves and blue jeans holding a stethoscope
a gun is tucked into his belt and dianas teddy bear tucked under his arm
he saunters over to the gagged and bound diana and alison on the floor and tied to a corner end of the bed
alison her eyes streaming tears struggles and pulls against her bonds to try to get at him but fails
diana keeps crying mommy
over and over again and sobbing
the figure crouches down beside diana dropping the teddy bear behind her his face still unseen
he takes the stethoscope and holds the end to dianas chest
the sound of a loud steady heartbeat is heard
alison screams at him through her gag
dont do that
get away from her
he pulls away the stethoscope and the heartbeat halts
he reaches with his right hand and pulls from his belt the gun
dianas screams become more desperate alisons more frantic more angry
he puts the stethoscope back against dianas chest and moves the gun up and down in front of her then bringing it up to her mothers head
we hear the heartbeat again doubled in speed
through her gag keep your motherfucking hands off of my daughter
he pulls away the gun and the stethoscope tucking the gun back into his belt
he reaches down behind diana and picks up the teddy bear
as he does we catch a brief glimpse of the lower half of his face but not enough for a clear identification yet
he holds the teddy bear out in front of diana for a moment then tucks it in front of her
he pats her on the head and stands up moving over to the window
he parts the curtains slightly and leans forward a bit and we see his face more clearly
it is zep the orderly from the hospital
cut to static and then a surveillance video view of the exterior of the gordon home of the window where zep is standing
the camera zooms in on him and we hear a raspy male voice speaking
vo as we view shot of zep who are you little man
i see you
cut to a television screen with the video of zep in the window
fade back and to the right as we get a view of someones apartment
plastered on the walls are various photographs which we can barely make out and a desk in the corner with some recording equipment
as we move further right and hit the window we see detective tapp leaning over the camera shooting the gordons window adjusting the view
something about him seems just not right
we cut back to his view from the camera
gordon know youre at home with his wife
i know you know something
his voice goes up a bit louder what are you doing in there
waiting for the doctor
im waiting for the doctor too
cut to a view over tapps couch of the television with zep on video on the screen
tapp walks over and sits down in front of the television his back to us
i never should have let you go
camera pans up to a wall of articles all about the jigsaw killings
it moves quickly and zooms in on each headline we see
jigsaw hunt brings d
before judge missing man discovered at bizarre crime scene screaming is heard then a quick flashback shot of paul in his cage first struggling against the wire then hanging dead
in his cage killer preaching says top cop psychopath teaches sick life lessons quick shot of mark going around looking for the code on the walls with the sound of his screaming over the shot escape victim survives maniacs game quick flashback footage of amanda in the interrogation room then fighting with her mask and a shot of lawrence watching and listening to her testimony doctor questioned in case flash of shots of lawrence being questioned by the tapp and sing and then his lawyer
it ends on the flashback shot of tapp looking back at lawrence through the two way glass after amanda tells her story and the shot slides into a shot of
a car pulling up alongside a building
vo fading hushed against soundtrack i never shouldve let you go
the car pulls up alongside a building with lawrence in the passenger seat and tapp driving
lawrences awkwardness tapps distrust and general uncomfortable tension can be easily detected between them
pretending like hes trying to be helpful really just glad to be out of tapps company here we are
that was uh quite an amazing story that poor woman told
tapp just nods says nothing
lawrence smiles very uncomfortably gets out of the car
leaning down and looking back into the car window
look im sorry i cant be of more help to your investigation
nods very slightly you know we arrested a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much
he lived two blocks from here
the sewer lines run under this neighborhood too doctor
hint hint lawrence stands straight up walks away
tapp waits a moment then drives off
bam into static and then the video from amandas cell
we are not at tapps desk in the police station watching him obsessively watch the video staring at the screen remote control in hand
as he watches the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective
from the video hello amanda
you dont know me but i know you
i want to play a game
heres what happens if you lose
theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing
when the timer goes off your mouth will be permanently ripped open
in the background of the station we hear a couple of detectives talking then sing walks in behind tapp over to his own desk
he turns watching tapp watch the screen
tapp stops and rewinds the tape
to the other detectives leaving ill catch you guys down there
he reaches over and gets something off of his desk from video think of it like a reverse bear trap
tapp fast forwards a bit hits play
from video ill show you
tapp watches closely the demonstration of the timer then the device going off and exploding
sing watches too not paying as close attention
as soon as it explodes sing speaks
the look on his face and the tone of his voice indicates his growing concern for his partners obsession over this case
tapp doesnt look up resembles lawrence in the earlier scene when alison and diana came to him to check her room while he was working on his paper
were gonna go down to the grill go get a beer
you wanna come
i dont think so
figured he might answer as such you know i always ask
he puts on his jacket on video there is only one key
ill leave you to have fun up here
he puts his hands on his hips watching some more of the video
on video its in the stomach of your dead cellmate
still trying to reach him break him from his obsession groove hey tapp
i dont mean for this to be disrespectful
pause maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend
sing chuckles hits tapp playfully on the arm tapp laughs a bit too but doesnt look up
sing remains grinning a bit
but then tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit
on video its in the stomach of your dead cellmate
tapp fast forwards
on video look around amanda
know that im not lying
sing steps off to the right you better hurry up
tapp rewinds again suddenly pauses wait wait wait sing
sing stops turns
get back here
he gestures franticly for him to come over
sighs then comes over what
tapp rewinds one second then pauses holds pencil to the screen to a grafittied wall on the video
remember th street
looks at the screen thinks a minute ah
that gangs territory was only about four blocks
now listen to this
they listen with the volume up high
over the static the sound of a fire alarm can just barely be heard in the background
they look at each other
tapp hits stop
looking up at sing we gotta check the records from all the fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks
go right now
sing turns and quickly walks off
close up of a map with sing speaking in a voiceover
as he speaks theres a brief shot of the two of them sitting over the map then quick shots of a few black and white photographs of a warehouse including
a close up of a street sign stygian st
vo on the night of tuesday the th we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of stygian street
its an old listing
used to be a mannequin factory
cut back to view of the two detectives you think we have enough for a warrant though
who said anything about a warrant
he grins gets up and grabs his jacket
are you serious
yeah why not
he grabs his gun snaps a cartridge into it grabsup his coat and quickly follows tapp
brief shot of k k graffiti on the video and then loud static which snaps into an exterior nighttime view of an old warehouse building and a car speeding by
our view is from inside the car as it pulls up alongside the building
a police radio can be heard in the background
so can the sound of a gun being loaded and cocked
vo at least well have the cover of darkness
vo yeah well so will anybody else
a shot of inside the factory various clutter and tables piled up on one another
no signs of life
a bang from the outside of the door is heard
a couple more bangs and a shot of the giant sliding wooden door as it slides open and sing steps in holding out his shotgun ready for anything waiting for
cut up to a staircase lit by eerie green light the same as from pauls razor wire room as the detectives make their way up cautiously tapp in front sing
covering behind them
they come up another level one that has been recently used we see as tapp points over to a desk with a computer a radio and some other miscellaneous items
then right next to the desk we see the k k graffiti from the video
i got you
they continue on moving into a room separated with a chain link fence
there is a slightly raised platform going along part of the wall with a few steps leading up on either side
tapp goes up the steps
on the raised area are some tables covered in heavy red cloth
tapp points to one reaches down and pulls back the covering
he reveals a small diorama of the bathroom scene where adam and lawrence dolls complete with the body dolls representing each of them
what the hell is this
his voice almost a whisper oh shit
they move onto the next table and tapp pulls back the cloth covering that one revealing the leering puppet from amandas video
tapp stares at it wide eyed
next to the puppet is a strange boar like mask with long dark hair
the camera pans back so we have the view of another large object covered in red cloth that tapp and sing had passed by
tapp leans in closer to look at the puppet when suddenly the still covered form starts to move and muffled moaning sounds are heard
it startles the detectives
they both go over and stand on either side of it taking one end of the red cloth whipping it off
underneath is a man tied to a chair with duct tape over his mouth held in place by a manacle around his neck
a contraption on the chair holds two power drills about six inches from either side of his head pointed directly at his temples
his eyes wide he moans through his tape at the detectives
suddenly a door is heard clanging open on the other side of the building and the detectives spin to face the sound guns ready
looks to sing says softly wait sing
trying to keep his voice low but coming off a bit loudly what
eager lets see what hes gonna do
weve fucking got him
tapp however having studied this guy for so long wants to get a good look at him before hes captured see him in his element
we dont know what he looks like
lets see what hes gonna do
rather loudly again no fucking way
as the two argue the man in the chair continues to protest his position
he moves in front of the man a bit holding up his hand to try to halt sing trying to convince him to go along with him
isnt buying into it fuck that
im gonna take him
what the fuck
wait sing listen
whoever it is is moving closer so they quickly cover up the man and the other things they uncovered
the man in the chair protests loudly through his gag and struggles as much as he can in his chair
sing and tapp go and hide behind a tarp covering the entryway to another room while a figure in a black robe lined in red comes up on the elevator
the elevator stops and the figure moves forward slowly and carefully
he goes up the steps to the man in the chair
the figures hood is up we do not see his face
as he walks he seems like he might be having a somewhat difficult time with it
he reaches and uncovers the man who begs in muffled tones through the gag
when the figure speaks we instantly know it is jigsaw it is the unmistakable voice from the tapes and the video
awake already jeff
i need more powerful tranquilizers next time
jeff continues his cries sheds a few tears
jigsaw reaches over and touches his shoulder dont cry
ive given your life a purpose
youre a test subject for something greater than yourself
thats when sing cocks the shotgun and the two detectives move out of their hiding spot aiming their weapons at jigsaw
hold it right there
put your fucking hands in the air
jigsaw slowly raises his hands starts to turn to face them but then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor and the drill trap on jeffs
chair comes to life
he remains with his back mostly to them hands still raised
now youll make a choice
sing runs up the steps to try to where jigsaw is gun aimed at him
tapp remains where he stands
in seconds the life of this man will be ended
shut up and get down here
keeping his gun steadily aimed what did you do
turn it off
jeff in the meantime is struggling in his seat as the drills come closer
sing stop that thing
im taking this bastard down
sing tosses tapp the shotgun
to jigsaw how do you turn it off
tell him how to stop it
jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs
one key will unlock it
frantic where is it
its in the box
he sees a box on the side of the chair and opens it
inside he pulls out a ring of at least keys and goes over to behind jeff to try to unlock the device
he tries a couple of keys none working
which key which key
tell him which key it is
now facing tapp moving closer to him
his back is to us we still dont see his face
time is running out
shut up and get down here right now asshole
jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more
whats more important to you officer arresting me or the life of another human being
sing keeps trying various keys
tapp goes up jigsaw and grabs him pushing him down to his knees
jigsaw keeps his arms slightly raised
get down on your knees
gun aimed at the back of jigsaws head hands behind your head
jigsaw obliges sick bastard
yes i am sick officer
still trying various keys none working
hes in a full fledged panic
jeff closes his eyes crying as the drills are only inches away tapp
its like theres a hundred keys in here
sick from the disease eating away at me inside
sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings
sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others
sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill breaking and stopping them
tapp glances up at him briefly distracted by the gunfire
as he pops a blade out of a wristband hidden up his right sleeve sick of it all
he lashes upwards slashing tapps throat seeing the throat slash tapp
runs down from jeff towards them
tapp clutches his throat completely surprised gurgling
jigsaw runs fast as he can out of the room
sing takes a couple of shots at him and misses
he stops when he reaches tapp who is slumped against the fence wall and bends down next to him
desperate a trace of despair no no
tapp gurgles at him hands him the shotgun
standing touching tapp on the shoulder then head ill be back okay
ill be back
tapp just kind of nods gurgling and holding his throat
sing spins around and then starts chasing jigsaw through the warehouse out of the room and down a flight of stairs
he moves down a long misty corridor gun up moving quickly but still cautiously
he takes a right goes down another flight of stairs then takes another right stopping and looking down a short flight of stairs
quick cut to tapp starting to try to get up holding his throat
he drags himself along the floor
back to sing who cocks his shotgun then moves down the stairs very cautiously
he takes a left around the corner finds himself facing down another corridor where he sees jigsaw trying to get away
he takes aim
shouting freeze or ill shoot
jigsaw continues moving so sing fires
he hits and jigsaw goes down
sing pauses waiting to see if he gets back up
jigsaw doesnt move so sing cocks the gun again and starts to slowly move forward towards him
cut to a shot of tapp as he struggles to his feet and starts towards the stairs to follow sing
back to sing moving further down the hall
he gets about halfway down it when we see a shot of his feet just at a trip wire
over it are some cobwebs hanging down
he reaches to part them and steps forward into the wire
as he steps we see a shot of a shotgun with wire slowly pulling down on the trigger
sing looks up and the trigger of that gun and six other shotguns pointing down directly at him fire
sing is hit blood splattering against him and the wall
we see only from his shoulders down
he spasms for a moment then falls forward to his knees
cut to tapp who is making strange vowel sounds moving down the flight of stairs just before the hallway where sing now is
on his knees sing remains upright for a moment spasming more
we go to a shot of jigsaw on the floor
jigsaw starts moving and gets himself up to his feet and starts hobbling further down the hall
sings body finally falls forward onto the floor spasming still
tapp continues down the stairs falling against the wall a couple of times
we see jigsaw as he gets to the end of the hall and starts sliding a large door open
at that moment tapp reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns into the hallway collapsing back into a sitting position on the stairs
jigsaw hobbles through the door and starts to go left
tapp sits up a bit and looks down the hall where he sees sing who has stopped spasming
his eyes widening tapp removes the hand from his throat and reaches forward towards sing his mouth opening and moving but no sound other than some gasping coming out
the shot fades to a slow paced black and white and then snaps into a few crime scene photos of sings body including a nice gory one of the top
of his head part of which is now missing
at the last photoflash we cut back to a shot of tapp presently sitting on his couch
the shot shows a good view of the scar across his neck
weak desperate had you
had you on your knees
he sits forward getting some things off the coffee table youre running
he gets up and goes over to the desk in the corner with the audio recording device and dozens of photos pinned to the wall takes a seat youre running
scared because we had you
im going to close this case
ram close it
he picks up a small framed photograph which we cant see but likely its of sing
were gonna close it sing
x marks the spot
he stands touching the pipe and looking up and around a bit
x marks the spot
we need to search this room again
he turns and looks over at adam
what are you doing over there
cut back into regular view in the bathroom with a shot of adam sitting on the tub holding the photograph of alison and diana just beneath the edge of the
inside of the tub looking down at it
he ignores lawrence flipping the photo over
irritated excuse me
glancing up calm irritation just because im stuck in this room with you doesnt mean i have to report to you every ten seconds
sighs i really dont see the point in us not helping one another
well what do you want me to do
im on a leash
thats exactly why we need to talk
we need to think
i am thinking
snapping at him well then dont keep me in the dark about what youre thinking
there is a pause as something about that statement strikes adam
turn off the lights
letting the photo fall into the tub as he stands turn them off now please
doesnt get it why
impatiently just turn them off for a second
lawrence stares at him oddly but moves backwards reaching over and flipping off the lights
adam looks around
lawrence looks around too but he sees nothing
he doesnt seem to think this is going to help any
then we see on the wall next to him a glow in the dark x painted on the tiles
he doesnt see it and shrugs but adam spots it
jesus behind you
turns and sees it is surprised how come we didnt see that before
the lights in here hadnt charged it
it must be glow in the dark paint or something
lawrence turns and flips the lights back on both of them wincing slightly at the sudden transition from dark to bright white though not as much as before
lawrence leans over and picks up his hacksaw going over to the tiles where the x is and starts hitting the tiles with the handle of the hacksaw
he breaks through reaching into a small cavity in the wall and pulling out a small brown box with a hinged lid
he cant believe it
he looks to adam a small grin on his face
he places it on the floor and sits down behind it
excitedly open it
turns it around so we and adam can see the small lock on it
he pauses thinking then realizes something the key the one from my envelope
where is it
adam looks around him then leans down looking on the floor for the key
soft hushed tone as he looks where the fuck
he finds it picks it up and tosses it over
lawrence picks up the key tries it on the lock
he takes the lock off opens the box
he holds up a cell phone smiling in relief
big smile cell phone
the most beautiful invention on this planet
lawrence takes out and holds up one of two cigarettes
adam lets out a joyful laugh
make that second most beautiful invention
he reaches out his hand for lawrence to toss it
give me that
are you joking
youre gonna put something we found in this room in your mouth
pause then yes im willing to risk it
give me that sweet cancer
lawrence ignores his request tosses out the other cigarette and a lighter
he finds lastly a small folded up note with the words shh doctor written on it
i dont care i really dont
give me one of those
jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as lawrence opens the paper and reads it keeping it low in the box where adam cant see it
vo the cigarettes are harmless i promise
smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed
think about this you dont need a gun to kill adam
growing impatient may i please have a cigarette
ignoring his plea im trying the police
he flips open and dials on the cell phone but a weird beeping noise indicating the call cant go through comes from the phone
he dials again same result
this was meant to receive calls not make them
a moment he realizes something
wait a minute
this has happened before
cut back to an overhead descending view inside a parking garage
vo last night after i finished at the hospital
fade into another closer shot of the cars and lawrence walking down the corridor carrying his briefcase
i was walking back to my car
he stops a moment i thought i was alone but im sure someone else was there
he squints bringing his hand up over his eyes
there is a flash from the side
he looks up startled looking in the direction in which he thinks it came from but sees nothing
he looks around him for another moment then continues forward to his car
cut to a shot within a circular overhead mirror of lawrences car pulling up to an abandoned security gate station
he gets out of the car shutting the door and going over to a phone on the wall to dial security to let him out
when he dials though it gives him a busy signal
as it beeps we cut to another shot of his car in the mirror
the back door on the passenger side starts to slowly open
back to lawrence who hangs up the phone aggravated and reaches into his pocket for his cell phone
he opens it and dials
back in the mirror we see something get out of the car on its hands and knees
it is in a red robe and has a strangely shaped head with long tangly dark hair
lawrence finishes dialing holds the phone to his ear but receives the same beeping tone as the phone in the bathroom indicating that he cannot make outgoing calls
perplexed he holds up the phone trying to get a better signal
alongside the car the thing moves even closer now
it gets up slowly
we see that it is wearing the strange boar mask previously seen in the flashback of jigsaws workshop
it suddenly rushes upon him as hes distracted with his phone and grabs him
cut back to lawrence sitting on the floor in the bathroom still holding the phone
his eyes distant off in his memory that
it was waiting for me
he exhales sharply then looks back up at adam
adam is just standing there staring at him
something seems a bit
with a suspicious tone lawrence addresses him
how did you know to turn off the lights
yeah but how did you know
a slight pause instinct
his tone is far from believable
doesnt believe a word of it instinct
you know what
he looks down then back up at adam
youre a terrible liar
quiet offense you say that like you know me
speaks calmly but anger lies underneath the surface what else arent you telling me
cocky and sarcastic well um lets see
on my sixth birthday my best friend at that time scott tibbs stabbed me with a rusty nail
i didnt tell you about that
i didnt tell you that my last girlfriend lawrence lowers his head into his hands
un fucking believable who was a feminist vegan punk broke up with me because she thought i was too angry
uh i havent told you that one of my toenails is slightly
snaps at him fed up just stop it
you knew to turn off these lights
turning away from lawrence what ever
stands up frustrated
im dealing with a juvenile
has had it looks right at him you wanna know
adam leans down and reaches into the bathtub pulls out and holds up the picture of alison and diana
with a somewhat aggressive attitude here it is
he throws it towards lawrence who looks down at it then back up at adam before getting down on the floor and pulling it towards him with the hinged box
he picks it up sitting up as he looks upon it with shock
very softly shakily oh god
he turns it over then back
adam casts his eyes downwards still standing but cooling off feeling bad for lawrence w
where did you get this
softly it was in your wallet behind the photo of your daughter
why didnt you show me this before
lawrence begins to shakily sob touching the photo
adam goes over and sits against a pipe in his corner lowering his head and upper body forward holding his head in his hands
lawrence sniffles shaking then looks right to the surveillance camera behind the glass and screams
what are you doing to them you bastard
he goes back to huddling over the photograph sniffling and crying for a moment
then he sits up trying to pull himself together okay
he looks around a bit okay ive got to think now
he looks down sees the note again in the box
vo think about this
you dont need a gun to kill adam
when theres that much poison in your blood a slow shot moving to the pool of blood from the body in front of lawrence the only thing left to do
is shoot yourself
lawrence looks at the body then down
hes getting an idea
he takes a cigarette glances over at adam who still has his head down in his hands
he dips the end of the cigarette in the blood then puts it back in the box
he starts to get up
adam looks up sees him standing
what are you doing
lawrence goes to the light looks at the camera suddenly flips off the lights
we see a shot of zep startling when the lights go out on the monitor then we go back to the darkened bathroom
what the hell are you doing
whispering so the surveillance camera will not pick him up adam listen to me
i want you to play along with me on this
zep leans in trying to hear whats being said but the static of the video is too loud
he tries to adjust the sound but to no avail
shot goes back into the bathroom where lawrence is finishing saying something to adam
you got that
he turns the lights back on both of them again wincing at the bright light
lawrence glances at the surveillance camera then looks to adam
trying to be nonchalant so you uh still want that cigarette
lawrence makes a show of reaching into the box where the poisoned cigarette is but takes the other un dipped one instead
he throws it to adam who reaches down and picks it up from where it lands
lawrence throws the lighter as well
adam puts the cigarette between his lips and reaches down picking up the lighter
he glances over at lawrence who watches him intently
adam just shrugs then lights up
he takes a long drag then exhales in a sigh of relief and with a smile
he takes another drag then suddenly freezes his head jerking and a strange gurgling sound coming from his throat
his head jerks more then the rest of his body his eyes widening
his hand drops the cigarette and goes to his throat as he turns still jerky and making a strange almost squeaky choking sound in his throat
the sound grows louder as he falls to his knees then back a bit his left arm held out in front of him dramatically
he falls backwards onto the floor twitching some more still choking
he lets out a long cough suddenly stops jerking and closes his eyes
the death in its entirety is very very fake
watches adam then turns to the surveillance camera speaks with angry finality there
ive done it
ive killed him with the poison just like you wanted
shouting now wheres my family
where are they
suddenly we go to a shot of adam lying there and a loud electrical buzzing sound is heard as his body jerks to life and he cries out
he spasms and jerks around as he is electrocuted and lawrence looks upon him in shock
finally the electrocution stops and adam sits up slightly gasping eyes wide
he shrieks in pain and shock jesus christ
lawrences reaction is not one of concern he simply cant believe that adam just screwed up the plan
wide eyed i just got electrocuted
he rolls his eyes
he speaks in a hushed tone
that was our way out
adam looks at him in shock cannot believe lawrence would think hed make something like that up
yelling at him did you hear what i said
he desperately grabs at the manacle around his ankle pulling at it and shrieking get this thing off me
get it off
pissed off stop acting
stops pulling at the manacle and chains now hes pissed at lawrence for his disbelief you think i would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade
gives up on adam frustrated once more all right thats it
he leans over and picks up his saw sits down and starts trying to saw through his chains again grunting
adam in the meantime just sits back against the wall breathing heavily looking dazed
lawrence continues to franticly saw but it doesnt work
he gets pissed off and throws the blade down
ah damn it
back to adam still looking dazed
suddenly a look of realization dawns upon his face
the electrocution has jogged his memory
wide eyed i remember everything now
lawrence glances over at him
i remember how i got here
flashback to adam walking up the stairs in his apartment building a camera around his neck smoking a cigarette and listening to music on his headphones
he walks with an uncaring slow swagger
he gets to the top of the stairs and walks down a red lit hallway to his apartment
he goes inside closing the door behind him then moving into the kitchen area throwing his keys onto the table and opening the fridge
the entire apartment is very rundown decrepit dingy and old truly a shithole apartment as adam described it earlier
there is graffiti on the door and walls the wallpaper is fading and peeling the refrigerator is dirty
adam opens the fridge and looks inside for a moment
he sighs then closes the door
he heads over to his darkroom closing the door behind him
the lighting is dark red
he puts the camera down on the table taking the strap off from around his neck takes off his headphones and cd player presses stop and puts them down off
to the side
he sighs tiredly and goes over to a tray where a photo is developing and picks it up with his fingers ganging it with a closepin on a hanging line
with other photos
it is a picture of a man wearing sunglasses
the man is in fact lawrence
to the left of that one is a shot of lawrence in the parking garage with his hand over his eyes
the camera cuts to a shot of the newest photo through a peephole in the darkroom door as the camera fades out and back viewing the grafittied door of the
darkroom before the shot fades to black industrial music playing over the shot
cut to adam sleeping in the now pitch black darkroom his head down on the table
he wakes up abruptly as though he hadnt meant to fall asleep
he looks around confused wondering why all the lights out
he gives a great another problem type of sigh
he stands and yawns reaching over for the lightswitch
he moves it up and down a few times but nothing happens
another aggravated sigh
he reaches down and finds a flashlight on the counter presses the on button but it doesnt work
pissed he shakes it hard trying to get it to come on but that doesnt work
he looks at it scoffs
suddenly he hears something move outside the door somewhere in his apartment
on alert he listens
he looks down and picks up his camera slinging it around his neck and holding it out in front of him
he opens the creaky door into his also pitch black apartment
he takes a few steps forward speaks nervously but trying to be brave
is someone there
he takes a picture the flash lighting up the area in front of him
i can hear you
he takes another picture the flash lighting up a living room area
he moves forward more into the kitchen entryway snapping away for light
suddenly from behind him an evil doll laugh is heard
he startles spinning around
his voice alarmed but confused at the same time what the
he snaps a picture in its direction and sees the puppet from jigsaws workshop and video sitting in an armchair continuing its evil laugh
he reaches down and finds a baseball bat on the floor and starts hitting the doll as hard as he can until the laugh starts to fade and then just
he hears the sound of movement again coming from just behind him in a closet
he goes on alert again holding up the baseball bat and the camera
who is that
whos in there
he moves towards the door shaking but trying to be a tough guy come on out
ill kill you you motherfucker
he opens the door holds the camera and takes a picture
as soon as the flash goes off we see the red robed pig thing that originally grabbed lawrence quickly move forward and grab adam
suddenly the cell phone rings
lawrence looks down at it in slight surprise
adam snaps out of his daze to look at it as well
lawrence glances over at adam and then carefully reaches down picks it up and answers it
the scene will cut back and forth to diana and alison in the room and lawrence on the phone for the duration of the conversation
not sure what to expect who is this
on the phone sobbing daddy
he stands daddy is that you
cut to a shot of her being held by zep the phone to her ear
getting sniffly yeah baby its me
adam watches him intently sobbing im scared daddy
trying his best to reassure her dont worry honey everythings going to be okay
shes here with me
staying as calm and collected as he can for his daughter let me talk to her sweetie okay
put mommy on
the bad man from my room is here
he has us tied up and he has a gun
please come home daddy
zep kisses her on the top of her head and takes the phone away to give to alison
zep pushes some of alisons hair behind her ear with the barrel of the gun
zep puts the phone up to alisons ear
is that you
we see a shot of alison giving a threatening look through her tears to zep
is adam there
surprised looks to adam who continues to watch him worriedly how do you know
ally what is going on
through her sobs trying to calm them and get this message to him dont believe adams lies
he knows you
he knew all about you before today
zep quickly takes the phone away hangs up
cut back to the bathroom lawrence on the phone
a dial tone is heard from the other end hanging up
lawrence is desperate hello
no answer just the dial tone
he stands up
he looks to the surveillance camera screaming god damn you
if you so much as lay a finger on them ill kill you
you hear me
you son of a bitch
ill kill you
he sits down leaning forward over the floor crying a bit
he slams his fist fiercely against the floor
quietly as though cautiously approaching a dangerous animal are they okay
his voice is calmer but rage is clearly underneath the surface my wife she uh she mentioned your name
a brief oh shit look appears in his eyes but he acts surprised what did she say
not looking at him yet
speaks very firmly trying to suppress his rage
she told me
not to believe you
cannot even look at lawrence
believe me about what
there is no doubt hes hiding something finally turns to look at him the look of deaths she told me you knew me
he stands looming menacingly the look stronger on his face who are you
still trying to cover up and losing still not making eye contact you know who i am
snaps shouting at him stop the lies
youre a liar
i need to know the truth
his tone changes hes had it with hiding had it with lawrence im a liar
finally he looks up right at lawrence
his voice is firm and accusing
what did you do last night lawrence

you told me that after you left your house last night you went to work at a hospital
defensively thats because its the truth
almost deadly no its not
your wife is right larry
lawrence is now the one wearing the oh shit look
you dont recall getting your picture taken in that parking lot
brief flashback shot of lawrence in the parking garage pausing and covering his eyes for a moment when the camera flashed
we see a shot of adam holding the camera and taking the shot from around a corner ducking back behind the column
lawrence looks up at the flash startled
cut back to the bathroom
adam stands up his stance and body language accusing of lawrence
he speaks fiercely disgusted with lawrences two faced bullshit
i can prove that you didnt go anywhere near a hospital last night
he leans over and pulls out the garbage bag from the tub
lawrence stands staring at him in near disbelief
he has been caught
adam takes a handful of photos from the baggie hed kept hidden inside the garbage bag holds them up and throws them down scattering them
its not the first time ive done it either larry
lawrence leans over to look at the photos on the floor in front of him with complete and utter disbelief picking one up and looking down at it ive been
taking pictures of you for a few days now
shots of some of adams pictures
lawrence going into a building lawrence at an outdoor cafe eating lunch
still holding the photograph but
you wanna know what i do
i get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you who go to seedy out of the way motels to fuck their secretaries
we start seeing more shots adam took while following lawrence last night i went to your house
flashback of adam holding his camera then cut to several photographs of lawrence leaving his house glancing over his shoulder and moving down the sidewalk i watched you leave
i followed you lawrence in the parking garage photographs of the exterior of the hotel barfly
lawrence inside the hotel knocking on the door to one of the rooms while adam hides around the corner with his camera all the way to that shitbag hotel
photographs of lawrence standing outside then going into the room

i found them in there points to the toilet quick flashback of adam pulling the bag out of the top of the toilet then adam opening the bag and seeing
the hacksaws and a glimpse of something else in the bag
with the hacksaws
flashback of adam tossing the bag into the bathtub while lawrence isnt looking
i dont know how they got there

he angrily crumples up and throws the photo he was holding at adam scoffing tone aww face it larry were both bulls hitters
but my camera isnt
it doesnt know how to lie
it only shows you whats put right in front of it
just out of curiosity what did you do in that motel room
you got out of there pretty fast
cut to a flashback the hotel room
carla the pretty asian girl from the hospital is inside the room now in a black lacy top and a gray blue skirt waiting for him
she opens the door taking a step back as he enters
he looks unsure of the whole situation a changed attitude this evening from all the others
he shuts the door behind him and carla smiles at him
lawrences tone when he speaks is unhappy
not enraged just somewhat disapproving
why did you um deem it necessary to page me when you knew i was at home
i didnt know if you were going to make it
turns goes and sits on the bed
sounding very business like but i gave you a precise time at which to page me
he puts the briefcase on a chair by the door then goes over and sits down next to her on the bed
you cant do that
its not like i know the rules for this sort of stuff
she starts unbuttoning her shirt
lawrence holds out his hand and stops her
she looks up at him concerned
whats wrong dr
a sigh in his voice look it was wrong for me to makes you come here
confused hurt but i thought we please
very softly im sorry
he stands and heads over to the door
carla remains sitting on the bed
she sniffles slightly but doesnt cry
suddenly the hotel room phone rings
carla and lawrence both look at it unsure startled
carla looks to lawrence
you tell anyone you were here
she stands goes over to the phone and answers it
she listens turns to lawrence its for you
she holds out the phone
he walks over takes the phone
the voice on the other end is male slightly raspy
it is unidentifiable it could be either tapp or zep or someone else
it is very accusing
i know what youre doing
i but the other person hangs up and a dial tone is heard lawrence hangs up the phone turns and moves to the door
carla moves with him watching waiting for him to say who it was
nervous i have to go
ive got to go
he picks up his briefcase from the chair and heads out the door
cut to the underground parking lot the same shot as where adam took lawrences picture
he walks along pauses to wince and cover his eyes then the flash
he looks up startled
the shot cuts back to lawrence leaning forward against the wall in his corner hand against a pipe
he slowly looks up at adam thinking of something
who was it
who was what
the person who paid you to follow me who was it
internal shrug he calls himself bob and he gives me the money up front
two hundred bucks a night
if id have known i was gonna end up here i wouldve asked for a hell of a lot more
pissy what does that mean
does that mean you saw what happened to me
internal eye roll speaks as though hes been over this times before what i saw was you get into your car
i didnt ask your name
i didnt know who you were
i dont know how i got here i dont know how you got here
i just took the shots as he speaks a quick flashback of adam taking a picture going up apartment stairs then in the darkroom and went straight home to develop
next thing i know im chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom staring at the guy ive been taking shots of all night
seeing a major break in this mystery clearly whoever paid you to take the pictures of me is the one who put is in here
they dont know that for sure maybe
what do you mean maybe
of course it is
what did he look like
internal shrug i dont know he was just a guy
shot of inside adams apartment and an unidentifiable figure towards the back of the room the image darkened so we cant make him out
the figure slowly takes a step towards us adam was he tall was he skinny obese what
i dont take notes about his appearance
shot inside apartment the figure moves closer aggravated how can he not remember anything
you must remember something about him
shot of inside the apartment the figure moves closer youre telling me you dont remember a thing about the guy
i told you i inside apartment the figure moves closer just about close enough for identification enraged throwing his hands up oh for fucks sake
i give up
gives up his playing dumb tone gives in due to irritation with lawrence hes a tall black guy hes got a scar around his neck okay
shot of inside the apartment the figure moves into a viewable light it is tapp
lawrence is leaning against the wall facing away from adam
at hearing adams description he slowly moves back turns around to face adam
shot of inside adams apartment tapp handing us adam money
adams our hand reaches out and takes it quickly
then back to lawrence detective tapp
whoa the guy who paid me to take these photos was not a cop
no no he was discharged from the police force
shot of tapp at his desk with the amanda video looking at notes
he broke down after his partner was killed tapp and sing sitting next to each other in lawrences office but that didnt stop him from harassing me
lawrence sitting in the car next to tapp the guy became obsessed
tapp in his current apartment adjusting the camera in the window then a shot of him leaning over a notebook going over notes
hes convinced himself that i must have somehow been involved with the murders
tapp at the corner desk in his apartment giving a crazy sounding heh heh heh laugh
the shot cuts back to lawrence who points accusingly at adam
and you helped him
disgusted you took money from him to invade my privacy
how could you do that
bite me tone call it my need to eat
sarcastic right right
you know what adam
youre not a victim of this game youre a part of it
points accusingly at him as he says this
obviously this cop thinks youre the one behind it all
facing into the corner of his cell turning around slightly internal eye roll
i told you hes not a cop
hes a bottom feeder just like you
a slight sneer from lawrence at adam
lawrence turns back into his corner getting really pissed at lawrences attitude towards him what are you more pissed off about
the fact that i took some shots of you or the fact that i took some shots of you while you were cheating on your wife
lawrence spins out of his corner screaming in rage
i did not cheat on her
what do you care what i think anyway
i dont give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a hooker gang bang
a pause then lawrence collapses onto the floor
hes lost the last of any strength level headedness or control he had before
weakly how did i get here
adam sits down on the pipe in his corner leaning forward a bit
i had everything in order
he lays down on his side facing adam who watches him with sympathy my whole life was in perfect order
he holds up and looks at the picture of alison and diana gagged
cut to the gordons bedroom
zep puts alisons gag back on her then leaves the room
alison moves her head around to loosen the gag then spits it out
she tries to fight her sobs as she speaks softly to diana
sweetheart are you okay
diana shakes her head no mommy just needs you to be really really really strong right now
im not gonna let anybody hurt you
you got that
diana nods okay thats my good girl
she starts crying as her hands work behind her to loosen the rope around them
cut back to adam in the bathroom looking up slightly from his position
he glances back down at the photographs on the floor notices something odd about one of them
he furrows his brow and gets down on his hands and knees reaching over and picking it up leaning back and looking at it studying it
camera cuts to a shot of lawrence through the black and white surveillance camera sitting on the floor
adams next line is a voice over over this shot
hey was there someone else at your house last night besides your wife and daughter
on camera no
still on camera well theres someone here
he tosses the photo to lawrence whosits up picks it up and looks at it
after a moment the shot cuts back to a regular view of them in the room
realization i know him
we see the photo as well
it is a shot looking up into lawrences window with zep standing there looking out completely unaware of his picture being taken
cut to a shot of zep listening
the shot goes back and forth between him as his eyes widen while lawrence makes his threats
his name is zep
hes an orderly at my hospital
his voice becomes a growl furious zep
you perverted little psychopath
im gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this
you bastard fuck
suddenly the shot cuts to adam who looks up at the clock with a very worried look
he points up to it
lawrence momentarily breaks from his zep rage looks up
the clock reads at
were out of time
crying mommy help me
alison continues to untie her
cut to zep getting up from his chair turning to go into the bedroom
alison hears him moving near sees his form through the frosted glass doors
she quickly replaces dianas gag and then her own and resumes her position with her hands behind her back just as the doors open and zep steps into the room
he looks down at them raises his eyebrows slightly
he seems to have gotten himself together ready to just do what has to be done
he takes the gun from his belt and leans down next to alison
he looks at her with wide eyes shakes his head sadly
he speaks calmly
gordons time is up
now ive gotta do what ive gotta do and
im afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed
he undoes her gag holds the phone to her head and his gun in front of her chest
quick cut to the bathroom where lawrence is still looking at the slightly crumpled picture of zep in the window
the phone rings startling them both
lawrence quickly answers it
speaking quickly the growling voice is that you zep you bastard
adam gets up from his corner moves forward slightly i know its you you son of a bitch
his eyes widen his fierce tone replaced with worry ally
cut into the bedroom
looking right at zep firmly you failed
quickly she grabs zeps gun and pushes him hard over to her left
he is taken by surprise and goes down easily
who can only hear the sound of a struggle hello
alison rips the gun right from his hand quickly backs up an stands
she keeps the gun aimed right at zep
he sits up slightly trying to slowly get up but she keeps the gun fiercely aimed at him keeping him there
his eyes are wide likely his one thought right now is fuck

he sits up a bit carefully slides it to her
he is watching her looking for an opportunity to overcome her once again
she picks the phone up still keeping her eyes and her gun at him
honey are you all right

zep starts to move up a bit more his right hand out leaning against the edge of the bed
ally threatens him more fiercely with the gun
larry where are you
unsure himself i dont know
im being held captive in a room somewhere
disbelief she sniffles a bit what

starting to cry im so sorry ally

zep slowly readies himself to move forward wide eyes still staring at alison
crying apologizing im sorry for everything
its my fault
please forgive me
ive always been happy with you
cries out mommy
alison turns to look at diana when she calls her and zep seizes the moment
he leaps up and grabs the gun from her hand and they start struggling with it
diana starts screaming
lawrence on his end hears the screaming and sounds of a struggle
in wrestling for the gun a shot is let off and diana continues to scream
cut to a shot of static on tapps tv set then tapp waking up to the sound of gunfire
he quickly looks over to the window
back to zep and alison who are still fighting for the gun
zep manages to spin her around and into a leaning forward position but she still holds on tight
another shot goes off
cut to a shot of tapp who hears it then looks at the tv
he sees the flash from the window on the television
he picks up his handgun and loads it quickly gets up and heads out
back in the apartment we see diana cowering still tied holding her teddy bear
zep gets behind diana tries to grab her but she keeps her arms and the gun upwards
another shot is fired off
adam watches him with wide eyes
the shot cuts back into the bedroom
mommy help me
the struggle moves over and into the dresser
zep gets the gun in his right hand and wraps his left arm around alison who quickly pulls open and takes out of the top drawer a pair of scissors
she spins around and with a scream stabs zep in his left leg
he screams in pain and goes down falling onto his side clutching his leg by a wooden column moaning in pain
alison quickly goes over and finishes untying diana
cut to the main hall of the residence where we see tapp enter and move down the hall with his gun ready
he moves cautiously but quickly
he sees zep on the floor squirming around and aims at him screaming
zep turns and sees him fires a shot in his direction but doesnt hit
tapp fires back and skims the top of zeps head
zep clutches the surface wound fires back
cut back to lawrence on the phone hearing only his daughter screaming and gunshots
he sobs collapsing forward onto the floor crying out oh no
adam watches him can only imagine what hes hearing
back to the bedroom tapp stands next to another wooden column and fires at zep again missing
alison finishes untying diana and the book from the room
zep fires at tapp again and misses
tapp fires back but his gun jams
zep sees alison and diana run from the room and his attention goes to them once more
trying to fix his gun what the fuck
zep gets up off the floor more but just then tapp gives up on his gun and charges at zep screaming
he tackles zep knocking him flat on his back
zep pushes his way up but tapp grabs him from behind pulling him towards him
cut back to lawrence still on the floor sobbing with the phone clutched in his hand
back to tapp and zep who get up to their feet
zep grabs a vase on the floor and turns smashing it over tapps head
the blow stuns tapp and sends him down
zep kneels down and picks up his gun then gets back up and starts hobbling after alison and diana
he reaches the living room but they are no where to be seen
drops old cartridge out of his gun pops in a new one diana
his breathing is fast desperate
he clutches the wound on his leg
im gonna kill your husband now mrs
he stands up a bit straighter and hobbles over to the computer station taking keys from the desk and then hobbling down the hall and out the door
we see tapp groaning starting to get up
zep glances over and sees tapp get to his feet but quickly hobbles to the doorway and out the door
tapp starts to follow just a we bit dazed from the hit
he empties his gun cartridge and replaces it then runs towards the door screaming
back to lawrence crying on the floor of the bathroom
hes just a complete wreck making low moaning sounds
suddenly there is a loud buzzing sound his body is jerked up and he is flung onto his back as he is electrocuted
adams eyes widen and he starts to panic
a bit of foamy spittle comes out of lawrences mouth as the electrocution continues and then a moment later stops
adam watches frightened unsure
lawrence is out
lawrence get up
zep is in the lead with tapp in hot pursuit behind him
they race through the streets as fast as they can
cut back to the bathroom
adam looks around him not sure what to do panicking
lawrence cant be dead he cant be alone in here
he cant handle this alone
he needs his calm collected doctor no matter how badly lawrence has treated him
crying out close to tears lawrence
i need you
he leans down and finds a piece of debris on the floor throws it at lawrence
it doesnt hit him
he leans down picks up another throws it
this one bounces onto the floor but ricochets and hits lawrence who begins to stir
a moment and lawrence starts to move more reaching for his head and sitting up
adam cries out in relief
oh thank god
i thought you were dead
sits up dazed and confused he
he electrocuted me
i told you
the same thing happened to me see
i wasnt lying see
lawrence leans over and grabs his chain the source of the electrocution
suddenly he snaps
screaming fuck this shit
back in the bathroom lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain
suddenly the phone rings and he turns
he quickly moves to get it but it is out of reach
he lays flat on the floor just a foot away from it trying desperately to grab it
in the hallway tapp enters keeping his gun aimed out in front of him
he looks down the hallway sees nothing
cut to zep climbing down a ladder into another level grunting in pain
tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall
in the bathroom the phone keeps ringing
lawrence grabs the hinged box turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone with it
he cannot reach and starts to cry loudly again
he tosses the box away crying screaming as he tries to reach the box with his arms
adam watches with a terrified look not knowing what to do
zep reaches the bottom of the ladder leaning against it moaning from the pain of his leg
he hears tapp above him hobbles off further down the hallway
tapp climbs down the ladder moving in the same direction as zep
as tapp can move faster than zep he rounds the corner and catches zep hobbling down the hallway
zep turns and sees him firing a few shots but missing
tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall
he leans out and fires at zep
zep falls back slightly but remains standing
if he got hit it isnt clear where
zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall
cut back to lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing
he lowers his head and cries loudly
frightened but trying to stay calm for lawrence
lawrence calm down
there must be a way out of this
it seems to be a complete role reversal for the two of them from the beginning where adam was the one freaking out and lawrence was calm
here adam is terrified but still calmer than lawrence who has just lost it
screaming i cant be calm
my family needs me
he cries and screams still cant get the phone
he quickly turns and sits up grabbing the chain and pulling it as he lets out a terrible scream of rage
adams hands are up clutching his head trying to keep his cool but having a very hard time
loudly trying to speak over lawrences continued loud primal screams
lawrence i have a family too
i dont see them thats my mistake
its a mistake id like to fix
cut to zep hobbling down the hall
tapp is there running after him
zep turns a corner and tapp runs to try to keep up
im gonna kill you you sick asshole
back in the bathroom lawrence continues to freak out as he mentally breaks down clutching the chain and screaming more
desperate losing his attempted calm stance lawrence stop it
lawrence sits up stops pulling at his chain but continues screaming
he starts to unbutton his blue button down shirt
that is too slow however so he starts to rip it open
sobs in his voice lawrence please calm down
theres a way out of here theres a way out
lawrence gets his shirt off down to a plain white tee shirt underneath
he starts to wrap one end around his manacled foot and ties it off
adam realizes what he is preparing to do completely loses it and freaks out screaming
oh my god
what are you doing
lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth biting it for a brace
the look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation
he takes up the hacksaw in his right hand puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while adam begins to scream in complete horror
lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth
the blood squirts up onto lawrences shirt and neck
adam collapses to the floor in his corner screaming and wincing
back to zep rounding another corner in the hallway
he moves into an old break room and tapp runs in after him finally catching up
tapp tackles him tripping him backwards and causing zep to hit his head against and old mini refrigerator
tapp grabs him and brings him up throwing him hard against the stone wall
zep falls down to his side
tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall
back to lawrence still sawing away blood on his face neck and shirt
back to tapp pummeling zep from behind in the back
a look of twisted glee is upon tapps face as he hits zep
zep falls to the floor gun beside him
he looks like he just wants to curl up and die
tapp goes down for the gun but zep reacts grabbing it
tapp grabs his hand and zep pushes himself up into a standing position the wall in front of him tapp pushing up behind him trying to take the gun
back in the bathroom adam is on his hands and knees screaming and crying as he begs lawrence to stop
lawrence does stop sits up and tosses the saw of to the side
adam collapses forward a bit
back to zep and tapp who continue struggling from the gun
zep squeezes his way down groaning as he suddenly drops down between tapp and the wall his gun aimed up at tapp
he pulls the trigger and the shot hits tapp in the chest a loud surprise to the former detective
back in the bathroom lawrence crawls along the floor moaning
he finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope looks at it
adam watches him in terror
screaming crying what are you doing
lawrence crawls on farther towards the body
cut back to a close up of the bloody hole in tapps chest
tapp remains standing a moment in shock gasping then falls down backwards onto the floor
zep is still on his knees holding the gun up at a diagonal
tapps eyes flutter then finally close
zep turns and gets up limping in pain out of the room and down another hall
back in the bathroom lawrence reaches the body
he takes the gun opens the chamber
what are you
he suddenly realizes lawrences intentions
his eyes go wide and he starts to cry out and beg
oh my god
oh my god
lawrence puts the bullet in then closes the chamber no
lawrence please im begging you
lawrence aims the gun at adam lawrence its not me who did this to you
looking like death his voice hoarse you have to die
his hands up in front of him defensively moving side to side to try to throw off lawrences aim no i want to live
moving the gun along with adams movements im sorry
i want to live
he aims and pulls the trigger hitting adam in the upper chest area
adam falls down forward onto the floor his screams stop
lawrence collapses sobbing
then he sits up a bit turning to the surveillance camera and screaming
ive done it
now show them to me
he continues to cry dropping the gun next to him collapsing back down with his forehead to the floor
cut to the gordons neighbors living room
alison paces back and forth holding a cell phone to her ear
two neighbors sit off to the side on a couch with diana
os on phone thank you very much officer

hanging up the phone and going over to alison did you get through to him
theres still no answer
reassuringly its all right
ive called the police
alison goes and sits on the couch
diana comes up to her and alison embraces her daughter
cut back to the bathroom with a shot of the sliding door
the sound of a lock being undone and a bang is heard
lawrence pushes himself up into a kneeling position a look of shock on his face
the door slides open and there stands zep green mist behind him in the hallway
lawrence turns and sees him
zeps eyes dart around the room seeming to say what the fuck happened in here
he sees lawrence on the floor and an eager look comes into his eyes
he walks in and lawrence starts to yell at him
ill fucking kill you
lawrence grabs zeps leg as he passes but is too weak and zep pulls away looking down at him moving over to the other side of the body ill fucking

lawrence quickly cralws forwarrd and takes up the gun pulling the trigger several times but there are no more bullets
it just clicks
ill fucking kill you
you fucking bastard
ill fucking kill you
ill fucking kill you
zep goes over to adam pushing his side with his foot a couple of times but to no reaction
he then looks to lawrence and aims his gun at him shaking his head
youre too late
its the rules
zep is about to pull the trigger when suddenly adam comes to and grabs his ankle pulling him down
the back of zeps head hits the floor hard
adam pulls him towards him struggles to get the gun from zeps hand screaming
the gun goes off once off to the side
adam moves zeps arm back and forth and it goes off again
finally adam slams zeps arm down and gets the gun away from him tossing it away
he slugs zep hard across the face stunning him
lawrence starts crawling towards them
screaming like a madman adam sits up and grabs the toilet seat lid from the toilet and slams it down onto zeps head as hard as he can
he repeats this seven times before the lid snaps in half
lawrence reaches the two and reaches up for adams arm as adam brings the broken lid down again
lawrence grabs his arm and adam drops the lid falling forward a bit and clutching his shoulder wound with his free hand crying hard
lawrence moves in touching his head to adams
his voice very weak and shaky youre going to be all right
adam stops sobbing for a moment youre just wounded in the shoulder
i have to go and get help
grasping lawrences shirt begging

lawrence nods pulling away from him and starts to crawl off
adam reaches for him as he turns himself around and away
he keeps crying no
lawrence crawls towards the door
he pauses turns to look back at adam dont
dont worry ill bring someone back i promise
he continues crawling on out the door while adam watches him pathetically still crying and reaching out for him
lawrence makes it out the door and starts dragging himself down the hall
adam is now alone in the room with two corpses
adam looks to the door one more time then turns to zeps body
he pulls himself on top of him wincing at his shoulder pain
he starts going through zeps pockets patting him down
he finds zeps wallet opens it and feels through it there s nothing of value to him right now
he tosses it down
he continues feeling for something suddenly feels something in zerps coat pocket
his eyes widen as he reaches in wincing from the pain in his shoulder
he pulls out a tape recorder
he stares at it his eyes and mouth starting to widen
he glances down at zep then at the tape recorder
sitting up a bit more he presses play
it is jigsaws voice

back to the shot of adam staring at him shocked
suddenly adam looks down grabs zeps gun and aims for john
but before he can pull the trigger john holds out the remote for the electricity and starts to electrocute adam who starts jerking around and drops the gun
as he spasms a very very fast montage of images from the entire film from beginning to the end starting with a shot of adam being electrocuted after his fake
death then lawrence then going back to the beginning all the way up and ending with adam stretched out on top of zep spasming still from the electrocution
suddenly the electricity stops and he gasps raspy loud breathing
john turns away starts towards the door
adam can only watch after him
vo most people are so ungrateful to be alive
john turns off the lights at the door only the green lighting from the hallway illuminating him and then adam just barely
john moves out the door slowly
but not you
adam reaches out for him and screams
john turns around and takes the door handle starting to slide it shut
adam screams as loud as he can in terror and despair as john pauses for a moment with the door halfway shut and says john slams the door shut the
rest of the way and we are left in darkness with the sound of adam screaming no
over and over and crying
the screams fade out and is replaced by the ending titles and instrumental music
