written by larry andy wachowski inside a closet
it is a large closet with double doors a crisp line of light cutting down through the center of the darkness
as we begin to descend voices echo in our head
i had this image of you inside of me like a part of me
we move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags
it is a womans closet
you planned this whole thing didnt you
wheres the fucking money
we glide over the tightly packed hangers close enough to feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to the racks of high heels
we make our own choices we pay our own prices
all part of the business
all part of the business
we slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and reach the bottom of the closet where we find a pair of black dr
martens boots that are tied together with a white rope
i want out
we move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound lying motionless on the floor of the closet the rope coiling tightly around her wrists
the crack at the bottom of the door lights her face
she is gagged and unconscious a trickle of blood running down her forehead
her name is corky
like a part of me
leaning against the back of the elevator is corky a very butch looking woman with short hair and a black leather jacket
she is a lesbian and wants people to know it
as the doors begin to slide shut a woman yells
hold the elevator
corky pushes the open button
a couple steps into the elevator
his name is caesar a middle aged italian wearing an expensive suit and sunglasses
she is violet a piece of sexual candy that would melt in your mouth
she hears it again a guttural sound
thanks again for this opportunity mr
she hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall
as she gets closer we hear a bed rocking tapping against the wall
the mans breathing grows more and more labored until finally it swells the whining motor of a high powered drain rod
the spiral cable whips wildly spiraling deeper into the tub drain black goo splattering everywhere
the machine is so loud corky almost cannot hear someone pounding on the apartment door
killing the motor she stands and goes to the door
behind the door is violet wearing jeans a white t shirt and cowboy boots
my name is violet
we sort of met in the elevator yeah sure
i heard you working in here and i just wondered if youd like a cup of coffee
she is holding two cups of coffee one black one with cream
come on in
give me a minute
violet steps inside as corky goes back to the bathroom to wash off the drain dreck
what happened to rajeev
corky calls from the bathroom scrubbing her hands vigorously
rajeev the man who usually works on the building
oh he went home to india but as far as i know hell be back
she wipes her hands on her overalls returning to the main room
so this is temporary for you
one day at a time
violet hands her the cup of black coffee
i guessed you were straight black
they both sip from the piping hot mugs
thanks i needed this
but to be honest i did have a slightly ulterior motive here
i was wondering if i could ask a small favor
yeah see im kind of a night person so i was wondering if it wasnt a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools
oh im sorry no it isnt your fault
the walls here are just so thin
are they really
yes it really causes problems
sometimes its like youre in the same room
but if its too much trouble i understand
no no trouble
theres other work to do
youre doing everything yourself
that is so amazing
im in awe of people who can fix things
my dad was like that
we never had anything new
whenever something broke he would open it up tinker with it and it would work
his hands were magic
she looks at corkys hands cupped around the mug
i bet your car is twenty years old
i knew it
so how do you know the owner mr
i dont really
i was referred to him
corky suddenly feels she has revealed something
do you know him
no but caesar does
he likes him
says hes a good italian
caesar is your husband
oh no no
im not the marrying kind
smiling she says nothing else
i should be going
you can drop the cup off anytime
corky watches her leave
a dirty bar hidden away on a dark street its cracked moon white sign the only evidence it exists
corkys truck swings into a space in front of a couple of large motorcycles
she flips her collar and heads for the door
the smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills corkys nose as she crosses to the bar
corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over
been awhile cork
five years two months sixteen days
how you doing sue
corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it
now that were all caught up how about a drink
sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two old styles
they click the bottles together and drink
you got a job yet
some plumbing painting and shit
i mean a j o b
a real job
not for me sue
im straight and narrow
im just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both
corky gets off the stool
thanks for the beer
looking around she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables
through the smoky din she bears a slight resemblance to violet
the woman is dressed all in black including a leather jacket
smiling corky slides into the chair beside her
there is no one smoother
that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor
the woman smiles just as someone taps corky on the shoulder
she turns and is face to face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather chicago police jacket
she is more wide than fat
whats happening here
her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips
a service revolver is clipped to her belt
she squints at corky her head nodding in recognition
wait i know you
i dont think so
i didnt know you were out
corky smiles at the woman in black
when you get tired of cagney and lacey come find me
she heads for the exit
the neighborhood would be politely described as rough
corkys truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street
it is a hole but it is home
corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling a beer resting on her stomach a folk singer quietly croons from the radio
we see the ceiling a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp
we move in on the spot which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light
suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling
corky is painting the ceiling
the folk ballad has become an angry riot grrrl anthem
she is working hard the roller sucking back and forth
sweat covers her face
dropping the roller down she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings
she stops and answers it
oh hi mr
yes everything is going fine
i got the tub drain all cleaned out
she listens for a moment
she glances at the main wall
all right all right i guess i could take a look
yeah youre welcome goodbye
she hangs up and looks again at the wall feeling
corky knocks and after a moment violet opens the door
she seems surprised
i didnt know he would call you
god you must think im a total nuisance
im sorry i usually would call rajeev but i didnt know what to do so i called mr
he said you lost something
yeah come on in
she steps back and corky walks inside
violet leads her through the apartment
it is expensively furnished with very masculine tastes a lot of gray and black leather
i was doing some dishes and just as i pulled the stopper my earring fell in
corky looks at her blankly
its one of my favorites
thats why i got upset
i know it probably seems ridiculous to you
an eyebrow goes up
im sorry look forget it
i shouldnt have called
i told bianchinni i would take a look
is it that sink
she opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel locks from her back pocket
the teeth of the channel locks open and bite onto the pressure nut
do you have a pot or a bucket
she hands one down to her
corky slides it under the curved pipe
as she works corky feels herself staring at violet at the hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs
water begins to trickle into the pan
the nut slides loose and corky tips the trap
water splashes into the pan with a soft metal tink
did you find it
corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring
violet screams a huge smile on her face half falling as she tries to hug corky
i cant believe it
you did it
corky leans back under and replaces the trap
thank you so much
you have to let me pay you something no
bianchinni asked me to do it
i did it
corky checks the drain by running the water
if you wont take money how about a drink
its getting late
you cant work all night
corky eyes her for a moment
okay one drink
what do you want
she smiles and turns to the bar
corky sits on the black leather couch and violet returns with two bottles of heineken
they clink the bottles and swig
you seem uncomfortable
do i make you nervous corky
she looks at violet then takes another long pull on the bottle
violet smiles her eyes again talking for her
thats funny im feeling a bit curious myself right now
violet notices the tattoo on corkys arm
thats a great tattoo
she reaches over and touches it
corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is
she nods rubbing it as if trying to hide it
are you surprised that i know what it is
i have a tattoo would you like to see it
she moves closer sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress
a woman in upstate new york did it for me
she is not wearing a bra
do you like it
set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green stemmed violet
it took her all day to do it
she promised me it wouldnt hurt but it was sore for a long time after
i couldnt even touch it
corky looks up from violets breast to her dark eyes
but now i love the way it feels
she runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin
here touch it
corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as violet takes her hand and places it on her breast
what are you doing
violet looks at her
isnt it obvious
im trying to seduce you
because i want to
ive wanted to since i first saw you in the elevator
corky watches her trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into violets nipple
inhaling sharply violet closes her eyes she can feel corky staring at her
you dont believe me
but i can prove it to you
she takes corkys wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body
you cant believe me because of what you see
she forces corkys hand between her legs up under her dress
but you can believe what you feel
violet opens her eyes a wanton smile on her lips
ive been thinking about you all day
corkys forearm flexes and violet moans
with both hands violet takes hold of corkys forearm
you planned this whole thing
violets head swims she is unable to breathe
you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose didnt you
if i say yes will you take your hand away
now it is corky who smiles
violet shivers her thighs rubbing her hips thrusting against corkys hand
her eyes barely open
in a single motion corky takes hold of the back of her neck and covers violets open mouth with her own
with her hand still stuffed between violets legs corky lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more more desperate more hungry until we hear the front door
unlock and open
violets eyes pop open and she pushes corky back
violet you home
they scramble to compose themselves
in here c
he comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two figures sitting close on the couch
he mistakes corky for a man
what the fuck is this
violet stands as caesar barrels toward the couch
i didnt expect what the fuck is going on
corky stands and turns caesar suddenly realizing that she is a woman
caesar this is corky
im sorry christ i thought
its fucking dark in here
he reaches to the wall for the lights
she is working for bianchinni
caesar extends his hand
oh right right
don mentioned that to me
hi welcome to the family
corky shakes his hand
youre helping rajeev
rajeevs in india
shes doing the work herself
bianchinni hired you
you know hes a good friend of mine
thats what violet said
he looks at her as if he knows something
so you just got out
it aint no big fuckin deal
i know who don hires
did you know he did time himself
corky shakes her head
thirteen fucking years
see there aint no secrets here
corky doesnt like this man
how manyd you do
thats none of your goddamn business caesar
you dont have to tell me if you dont want to
i just hope you understand youre among good people here
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of money and peels several hundreds
corky stares at it
come on come on
if you understand what im talking about youre going to take the money
if you dont im going to have to worry about you
corky takes it
i hate to worry
i got ulcers
i should be going
how about a drink
my brushes i have to clean my brushes
close on the paintbrush corkys fingers pushing through and separating the black bristles under the running water
when the brush is clean she flicks it dry and resets the edge
she goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops noticing her left hand
it is the hand that was between violets legs
she is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in the mirror
what are you doing
she drops her hand
what am i doing
im fucking up thats what im doing
she scrubs her hands clean
it is late the area burnished with amber street light
corky walks from the building to her truck
she climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition when suddenly the passenger door opens and violet gets in
stunned corky stares at her
i had to see you
look i dont think this is a good idea
i wanted to apologize
dont apologize please
i cant stand women who apologize for wanting sex
im not apologizing for what i did she slides across the seat
im apologizing for what i didnt do
she kisses corky and if corky is trying to resist we cant tell
the windshield is beginning to steam when violet panting breaks the kiss
do you have a bed somewhere
unable to speak corky reaches over and starts the engine
there is nothing flower scented or out of focus about it
it is sweaty slippery body grinding bed squeaking lesbian sex pungent and potent and when it is over neither woman can move
finally corkys eyes flutter open
i can see again
slowly corky gets up and goes to the fridge
she grabs a beer and presses it to her sweating forebead
after a moment she lowers it gently pressing the cold can elsewhere
eyes closed she lets out a long ahh
violet hears the sizzle pop of the beer as corky returns to the bed
she holds the beer to violets lips and tilts the can watching violets throat as she drinks
violets eyes open
i needed that
tell me about it
corky hands her the beer as violet sits up a bit
caesars mafia isnt he
you have to ask
funny nobody calls it that anymore
caesar calls it the business
how did you meet him
they took over a club i was working at
caesar started managing it
hes a launderer
how long have you been with him
almost five years
five years is a long time
yes it is
corky stares at her beer
she knows what violet is thinking
the redistribution of wealth
isnt that what you wanted to know
what i did time for
the redistribution of wealth
thats what i tell someone when im trying to get them in my bed
im already in your bed
my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught
she was always more honest than me
corky sips her beer
i started stealing when i was little
we were piss poor which is not an excuse just a fact
it isnt like her to talk about this especially with someone she just met
the first time i remember so vividly
a bunch of us kids were at waxmans drugstore when mr
waxman who was a mean old prick always worrying about us robbing him dropped a roll of quarters
we can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor
i can still hear that sound those quarters because right then something clicked inside of me
some instinct took over and as everyone including waxman dove down i reached up and emptied the cash register
she likes this woman
i gave most of the money to my mom
i told her i found it at the trainyard
she was so happy she cried calling me her lucky charm
fifteen years later i guess my luck ran out
sbe swallows that with beer
sometimes i tell myself that i didnt have a choice that stealing was surviving
usually i can admit thats bullshit
i did it because it was a way out
it was easy and i was good at it real good
she glances at violet
i dont usually talk this much
i guess i have been rehabilitated
you didnt have to tell me if you didnt want to
i guess i wanted to
im glad you did
so am i
corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools
grinning like someone who has been well laid she whistles off to work
between the main doors she sees a man
his name is shelly and he is an overdressed accountant
he is very nervous talking to someone through the intercom
i know hes gone
i have to talk to you
fiddling with her keys corky recognizes the voice that answers him
what do you want shelly
shelly glances over his shoulder at corky answering in a hushed voice
i have to leave
for a moment the intercom is silent
then the door buzzes and shelly pushes inside
corky follows him to the elevator
corky glares at shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her circular saw
shelly hides behind his sunglasses watching the elevator numbers go up
the doors open and he scurries out
she watches him enter caesars apartment her smile now completely gone
it is later
through the wall we listen to the same sound as before of two people making love
we drop down and find corkys brush still wet with paint abandoned in her tray
her face glistening with sweat violet climaxes letting the orgasm spread through her like melting butter
i had this image of you inside of me
she flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis
like a part of me
as she opens her eyes we see that her lover is corky
violet watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed
you are so beautiful
corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on
violet sits up
she can feel that something is wrong
violet pulls the sheet around her
yes there is
i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee
shit here we go
you didnt want to see me did you
if there is one thing i cant stand about sleeping with women its all the fucking mind reading
what are you afraid of
im not afraid of anything
i dont understand
you cant understand because were different violet
were not that different corky
how can you sit in that bed and say that
because its the truth
let me guess
this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside
that inside you there is a little dyke just like me
oh no shes nothing like you
shes a lot smarter than you
is that what her daddy tells her
i know what i am
i dont need to have it tattooed on my shoulder
what are you saying
that you dont have sex with men
for christs sake violet
i heard you
thin walls remember
what you heard wasnt sex
what the fuck was it
all my life everyone has been telling me that when i have sex im not really having sex
not real sex
but theyre wrong
i know what is and isnt sex and what you heard was definitely not sex
what was it then
that knocks corky back
you made certain choices in your life that you paid for
you said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy
do you think youre the only one thats good at something
violet stare pins corky to the wall
we make our own choices and we pay our own prices
i think were more alike than you want to admit
what about that guy this morning
you mean shelly
dont tell me youre a workaholic
shelly knows what i am
he saw me in a bar with another woman
i suppose he just wants to watch
thats all violet can take
i think you better leave
i think so too
violet turns away
try not to steal anything on the way out
that stings but corky walks out without looking back
it is dark now
corky is standing above the paint tray that has skinned over
she picks up the brush
it is dry with paint
she throws the brush across the room
a green and white street sign juts in the foreground of caesars upscale apartment building
the sign reads franklin street
the rusty chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the service entrance
in its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity and sink
corky climbs out of the cab and into the back unhooking the bungee cords that hold down the boxes
she looks up as a black lincoln town car screeches into a spot not far from her truck
three serious looking men get out leading a fourth shelly
he is the only one who seems to notice corky
they enter the building the door closing behind them
corkys legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work
she stands giving it a yank and pulling it away from the wall when voices begin to filter in from the next door apartment
she listens a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out by an angry voice
shut the fuck up
you piece of shit
we hear a scream
youre going to tell us
youre going to fuckin tell us
just a matter of fuckin time
each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds
where is it
where the fuck is it
we begin to close in on corky as she listens to each thud watching something that disturbs her
you piece of shit
with each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck cymbal
as we move closer the sound swells until where blood splatters the toilet heavy drops hitting the water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds
did that hurt
news flash fucko im just getting started
the angry voice belongs to johnnie marzzone
shelly is kneeling in front of the toilet hands tied behind his back with electrical wire
johnnie marzzone is a flashy young man in armani slacks silk shirt and silver tipped cowboy boots
his tie is tucked in as if torture were a fine dining experience
caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom
you got nerve trying to fuck us
nobody fucks me
nobody fucks my father
shelly screams as jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the toilet
come on hes making too much noise
you hear that bitch
here put this in his mouth
caesar hands a towel to johnnie who stuffs it into shellys mouth
like corky violet can hear the beating
she is trying to block it out but cannot
standing at the bar she runs the blender grinding ice cubes trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom
the bathroom door opens
i can go all night
caesar steps out shutting the door masking the sounds behind him
violet moves toward him
caesar im leaving
oh come on i didnt use one of the good towels
the door opens again as someone else steps out
caesar im serious
this is too much
i have to get out of here
cause you know him
you women are so fucking sensitive
he takes hold of her
but i dont want you to go
i like you here
you know this isnt easy for me either
he embraces her
over his shoulder she sees mickey malnano in the hallway staring at her
he is an older man hair graying built like a fireplug
sinewy mass strains at his brooks brothers suit
now why dont you go watch some tv or something
are you okay violet
mickey why is johnnie here
you know how i feel about that fucking psycho
mickey continues to stare at violet who looks up at him with her big doe eyes
caesar didnt i tell you to get something
he goes to the kitchen
mickey moves closer to violet lifting her chin the way a father would do to his little girl
you shouldnt have to see this
why dont you get out of here
go for a walk
caesar wants me to stay
dont worry about caesar
ill handle caesar
you just get out of here okay
caesar returns from the kitchen
he is holding a pair of tin snips
mickey takes them
now lets end this thing
violet watches them return to the bathroom
mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named lou
he slaps johnnie on the back
hey johnnie ease up okay
johnnie hits shelly once more
johnnie checks his hair in the mirror carefully
then he begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating
mickey kneels down next to shellys ear and motions to lou who lifts shellys bound arms
shelly im going to ask you ten times
mickey grabs shellys pinky finger putting it between the metal blades
where is our money
shelly whimpers red faced and sobbing
there is a sick crunch and shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear
we hear caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the frame scooping up the pinky
he plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to the bottom
caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes
corky cant stand it anymore
she throws her tools down leaves the bathroom and finds violet waiting in the main room
both women stand apart in silence
violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesnt know how to start
her lip begins to quiver her eyes search the room returning to corky each time
the violence in the next room can still be heard
are you all right
almost unnoticeably violet shakes her bead
corky puts her arm around her
it is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon
dark wood and padded leather
the bartender joking with a cluster of men does not notice corky as she moves up to the bar
the bartender glances over
draft beer and a tnt
corky eyes the men who stare into their drinks
the bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of her
corky heads for her table ignoring the whispers and snickers
corky and violet the only women in the room sit close together at a far corner table
violets voice is hushed
shelly was skimming from the business
he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out
he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him
even though he knew about you
he was in love with you right
thats what he told himself
but it wasnt even about me it was about caesar
he wanted what caesar had
thats how they are
i understand them
she glances around the room a man at the bar smiles at her
for shelly taking the money was a way to take from caesar
he could have run at any time but he didnt because he didnt want out
sounds like he wanted to get caught
maybe he did
he would brag to me all the time
he was never afraid of caesar because he didnt know him
not like i do
two men sit down near them laughing
caesar lives for these moments
he tells me its just the business but i know its more than that
he likes it
ill catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars
he says they remind him who he his
theyre all like that
except maybe mickey
hes the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be
but mickey doesnt like it like they do
i suppose thats why hes good at it
violet stares at her glass at the melting ice
i used to be able to block it out
i would tell myself that i wasnt really there so nothing really mattered
but i cant do it anymore
she downs the last of her drink
ive been making the same mistake shelly made
but now i know what i want
she turns to corky
i want out
i want a new life
i see what ive been waiting for but i need you corky
you made a choice once
do you think you would make that same choice again
if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register
corky stares at her knowing where this is going
she glances around the crowded bar
corkys truck sits in a gravel parking lot
through the back window of the truck violet and corky are silhouettes against the street light
caesar is going to get the money and bring how much money
shelly said it was over two million dollars
corky quietly swallows that pill
it begins to rain
caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through shellys books to figure out how he did it
wait a minute
wait a minute
do you have any idea what you are saying
you are asking me to help you fuck the mob
these people are serious violet
if you want to know how serious ask shelly
theyre worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules
you fuck them youve got to do it right
thats why i need your help
you said you were good
i am but
she knows violet is challenging her
all right lets say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying
you think im lying
i didnt say that but since you did lets say that you are
it would have been easy to set shelly up
you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment
violet stares her face poker blank
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me
is that what you think
im just making a point
you have no idea what youre asking
how much trust two people need to do something like this
she moves closer to violet the sound of the rain beating against the metal cab
for me stealing is a lot like sex
two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk they start to plan and its like flirting a kind of foreplay because the more they
talk about it the wetter they get
the difference is i can have sex with someone i just met someone i hardly know but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself
do you think you know me like that
they are close enough to kiss
were going to find out
corky pulls back
but first i want to see this money
violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open caesar charging in
he is doubled over clutching something to his stomach
he rushes to the kitchen dumping a bloody bundle into the double sink
there is blood everywhere smeared up and down caesars front
oh my god
violet takes a step toward him unsure of what has happened
it aint mine
he pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard
caesar what happened
it was unbelievable
un fucking believable
he pours himeslf a shot belting it back
goddammit look at this shirt
he begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt
it started when shelly took us to the money
i tell you mickey malnato knows his shit he does
shelly takes us right there
he throws down another shot
so shellys down on his knees and hes pulling out this bag of money from a safe in the floor and im staring at it like holy fuck
i mean look at it he tears open the bloody bag wet money bricks spilling out
and all i can think is how the fuck did he do this when bang
johnnie caps him
blood sprays everywhere all over the money
weve no idea if this is even all of it
caesar is exasperated
and right then i go through the roof and boom
i belt the dumb fuck as hard as i can
i didnt care whose son he was i just wanted to hit him again
knock some sense into that dumb son of a bitch
he looks at the pile of bloody money
just look at this mess i got to deal with
what are you going to do with it
i told them to run it through the cycles
but i guess gino has plans for it because hes coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up
searching through a sink cabinet he cant find what he needs
where the hells the laundry detergent
in the linen closet
caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom
violets eyes do not move from the pile of money
corky seems to come from nowhere
come to my place in the morning
corkys hands twitch and then flex against the ropes that bind them
a reflex echoes through her body muscles spasm and limbs jerk against their bonds
as if in a dream she struggles trying to get free fighting toward the edge of consciousness until she seems to succumb slipping back into stillness
we move toward her face her closed eyes as we again hear the voices in her head
youre having second thoughts
violet is on the bed corky at the window
she turns to violet
you said he washed the money
he hung it up
to let it dry
she begins to focus on the memory
it was unreal
moving in on her face
benjamin franklins face on a hundred dollar bill
franklins face rotates as we pull back seeing rows of bills carefully paper clipped to lines of string
hundreds paper clipped everywhere like leaves
eyes filled with green violet turns inside the laundry lines of money until she sees caesar
wearing his undershirt he is across the room standing at the ironing board ironing every single bill
he seems to have one eye on her one eye on his work
then one by one he ironed all of it
he sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming iron to them
did he sleep
violet is in bed unable to sleep listening to the machine shuffle of caesars bill counter
but neither did i
we move past her floating toward the wall
all night long i listened to that sound
we drift across caesars desk past bricks of bound bills as caesar folds the paper tape around another stack
he hits the counter again and we hear the sound now very loud as hundreds blur by fluttering beneath us
the sound of money
the sound rolls into thunder that seems to shake the apartment
and where is it now
in his office
i saw it this morning
violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee
working furiously at the computer caesar jumps when he sees her bloodshot eyes animal wide
he checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him
i need to go to the store
he nods automatically back in his work as she sees the briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds
its in a case on his desk
does the case lock
we see the open top with its silver flip over locks
violet is trying to remember
corky begins to pace ordering the information in her head
all right now tell me about johnnie
it sounded like he and caesar dont like each other
like each other
they hate each other
it started way before i was around
i think basically its because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot
but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father
who is gino
violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake
as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family
thats his brother
corky covers her mouth
gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money
and johnnie is his son thats johnnie marzzone
eyes wide she paces pulling at her lip mumbling
suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place
she looks at violet
shes pacing again
gino marzzone is coming to your apartment
its a big deal isnt it
that means caesar will be ready
he doesnt want to look like an idiot
gino has been there before
not much really
caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment
the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear
something occurs to corky
does johnnie hit on you
johnnie hits on anything in high heels
has caesar ever seen him
he does it right in front of him
its getting better and better
gino doesnt know english or at least he pretends he doesnt so he doesnt talk much
he gets right to the point
both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left
what did gino drink
i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it
corky smiles the wheels rolling
she turns from the window and gets onto the bed
i have an idea to make this work
violet is getting dressed lining her lips with lip pencil
youll go back and get ready take your time make it real
as she works on her face we see the room behind her and the discarded dresses scattered about
the more attractive you are the more believable it will be
corky breaks her thought train
what time did you say they would be there
the plane is in at seven so id say about eight
gino travels with a big man named roy
caesar calls him the driver
caesar again checks his watch
at some point caesar is going to quit
id guess sometime around six making sure hes got time to get ready
the watch reads
caesar rubs his eyes his temples
violet is at the bar in a sexy dress and high heels
un fucking believable what this guy did
shelly is one smart ass mothefucker i mean he was one smart ass motherfucker
he laughs as violet smiles handing him an enormous drink
as soon as he is done youll be right there to put a big drink in his hand
he takes the drink
we want him to come down to relax feel in control again
poor boy has to work so hard
she gives him a womans sympathy pout he knows what it loves it anyway
smiling he slides his hand down over her ass
you look good enough to eat
she smiles and waits for the kiss she knows is coming
both women are starting to feel it to believe it
where will you be
waiting in the apartment next door
corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment
she has taken off her boots which are beside her
waiting for what
through the wall we can hear the shower
for the shower
that will be our signal
corky opens a thin box filled with needle thin lock picks
she selects several and slips them into her multi pierced ears like earrings
when hes done with his shower you will go to the bar
in slow motion caesar drops the shower plunger and water chokes from the faucet
behind the bar violet pulls out the bottle of glenlivet
youll get out the scotch that gino drinks
violet steps out from the bar her eyes on the bedroom when the bottle slips from her hands
we watch it slowly fall and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands
and shatter against the hardwood floor
caesar yells from the bathroom
hearing caesar corky gets up moving quietly toward the door
what the fuck was it
caesar enters a towel wrapped around him hair still dripping
you cant hear me
violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up
caesar it slipped
i was trying to get ready
caesar realizing what happened
oh fucking christ
you gotta be kidding me
he rushes at her
how did you
it was an accident
she stands up
dont worry ill get some more
theres no time
dont be silly caesar
itll take five minutes
she turns him back toward the bedroom
ill clean this up and be back before youre even dressed
violet opens her door stepping into the hall where corky is waiting
when you open the door ill be there
they pass each other in silence violet stepping out as corky slips in
what if he sees you
caesar is working intensely on his fingernails
we glide over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools
we see his hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a nail
through the open door we see corky moving almost casually across the living room
corky is looking for something
you cant know for certain that he wont see you
trust me violet
she finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets
im just asking what if
if he does
corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring pulling out a gun
then i wont have a choice will i
she tosses the gun on the bed
the black case is lying on the desk locked shut
corky moves around the desk dropping down behind it
when im inside i will get the money
from her earlobe she chooses the right pick sliding out the silver tool
it takes only a second and the first lock pops open
she is working on the other lock when the door is pushed open and caesar walks in
corky drops down grasping for her gun as caesar wearing only underwear enters
he blows on the drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting a suit from his closet
the gun ready corky pressed against the desk waits until he leaves
she lets her breath out then pops the second lock unzips the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case filling the bag with fat money bricks
im going to need something
finished she zips up the bag and looks about
to fill the case
sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk
yeah you should hide it near the desk before you leave
she fills the case then closes it
at that point she thumbs the locks shut and they snap unnaturally loud into place
they are both on the bed
there is no going back
when i get the scotch how do i know you wont take off
the same way ill know that you went to scotch
their faces are close eyes still trying to read each other
i still dont see how im going to get clean with the money in the apartment
everyone will think i did it
because of what you are going to tell him
you have to make it as real as you can
the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand you will be covered and that moment is the most important moment in the plan
the door bursts open
violet enters quickly carrying a bottle in a thin brown bag
if its real enough hell believe it because deep down hell want to
shit im sorry
caesar wanders out tightening his tie
she looks at her watch
they were early
what are you talking about
they just left didnt they
what are you drunk
he smiles grabbing the bottle from her
you mean they werent up here
theyre still on their way
that doesnt make any sense
because i just saw johnnie downstairs
i was getting out of the car when i saw him in the mercedes
it couldnt have been
it was him
caesar i know johnnie
it was him
i screamed when i saw him
i couldnt believe i missed them
i knew you were going to be upset so i thought id apologize and give gino the scotch
i honked a couple of times but he didnt stop
she watches him her words caving in around him
but ginos plane doesnt get in for another half hour
actually i didnt see gino in the car
his eyes dart
his forehead beads with sweat
he turns toward the office
violet is staring at corkys mouth
if caesar hates johnnie like you say then the second he opens the case hell know in his gut that johnnie just fucked him
hell realize that he has no choice
he cant touch gino or johnnie
theres only one way out
hell have to run
if he runs everyone will assume he took the money
youll be clean and well be rich
caesar stands over the desk afraid to open the case
jesus thats beautiful
if youre this goddamn smart how did you ever get caught
every job like this has moments where things dont go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass
its in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart
she looks dead at violet
i had a partner and she fucked me
i think were going to find out
the key turns and the locks pop
when caesar sees the newspaper the whole world begins to spin
his chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into fists
no no no no
she moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper
he slams the case shut his head hanging down
after a moment he looks at her like a little boy about to cry
ive been set up
he seems ready to scream but cant say anything
the name is like water hitting hot oil
that rat fuck
little shit rat fuck
he starts punching the desk each blow harder than the last
corky can hear him pounding
she looks down and smiles
between her legs is the open bag stuffed with money
caesar is choking on his own rage
why would johnnie do this
jesus christ violet
open your fucking eyes
johnnie hates me like i hate him
he starts to pound his fists against his own head
i hate that little fuck
i hate him
i hate him
i shouldve done him
but you know he did it
so fucking what
use your head violet
the money is gone
gino is coming here to get it
you think hes going to believe me if i tell him his piss hole son stole it
is that what you think
you know what i think
i think im a dead man
im one in the brain
thats what i think
caesar what are we going to do
he grabs hold of his chair using it to support himself i know what he wants me to do
he wants me out of here
he wants me to run
she watches him his body rocking against the chair
if i run then everyone will think i took the money and he walks away with two million clean
the words squeeze out like tears
god i can see him right now driving to get gino
i can hear him laughing fucking laughing laughing at me
he swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it down on the desk
again and again
laughing at me
laughing at me
the chair falls and he stands alone covering his face to hide his tears
she goes to hold him
dont touch me
he backs into the corner of the room
just leave me alone
i got to think
violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from his face
got to think this through
caesar maybe we should run violet please
i mean it caesar forget johnnie forget the money lets just go now before its too late goddammit violet
would you just leave me the fuck alone
all right caesar
violet enters closing the door quietly behind her
she looks at the wall then goes to the bed and picks up the phone
as she dials we move along the phone cord following it down to the jack in the wall
we move out from another jack following a different cord
corky is sitting with her back to the wall
the black phone beside her barely rings once before she answers
she waits saying nothing
violet whispers her hand cupped over the mouthpiece
he totally freaked
ive never seen him like this
hes out of his fucking mind
thats okay as long as he believes it was johnnie
jesus its driving him crazy
he wants to kill him
i dont know corky i dont know what he is going to do
im getting nervous really nervous
its all right violet
all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does
what if he doesnt run
that means he probably will kill johnnie
oh christ i got to get out of here
listen if he doesnt run all you have to do is break down go to your bedroom and pack some things start crying saying you love him but you cant
youre sorry but you have to leave and just walk out
okay all right
were almost there violet
just hang on
violet hears him
she hangs up quickly just as caesar bursts in
i got it
i know what i got to do
i got to get the money
the moneys gone
johnnies got it
all i got to do is get it back
but it could be anywhere
he didnt have that much time
he had to pick up gino
i bet you hes got it with him
i bet its in the car
corky presses against the wall trying to hear
caesar is pacing
he didnt see you did he
see right now he doesnt know that i know thats why he put the paper in the case
he wants me to hand the case to gino
then there is no doubt it was me
gino will put a bullet in me himself
but it aint going to happen
i wont let it
johnnie aint going to fuck me
not like this
this is insane
she throws open her closet
what are you doing
she grabs a suitcase from under the bed
this is crazy
i dont want to be involved
i dont want anything to do with this shit
she starts yanking the dresses from the closet
you cant leave
the hell i cant
i need you
you dont need me
youve never needed me
i cant help you
i have to get out
violet i wont let you leave
she turns and sees that he is holding a gun
if youre not with me violet then i have to assume youre against me
caesar this is crazy
maybe it is maybe it isnt
maybe you dropped the scotch by accident
maybe you didnt
now it is her turn to feel the world spin
it would have been so easy to let him in as you went out
you dont you cant believe that ive seen the way he looks at you
hes always wanted you
maybe two million dollars finally bought you
she slaps him hard
he stares at her
im sorry violet but it has to be this way
he moves past her picks up the dresses and returns them to the closet
i hope you understand
i want to trust you i want to believe you but i dont have any other choice
he shuts the closet
caesar is at the bar drinking the scotch
the gun in front of him
across the room violet sits staring holes through him
they wait in silence
you sure you dont want a drink
violet says nothing
in the dark corky sits her face her posture very similar to violets
she is concentrating her mind somewhere else when the door buzzer sounds
she turns her head and hears caesar faintly answering the intercom
corky stands just as violet stands
caesar faces her for a moment then shoves the gun into his belt behind his back
corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by
there is a knock and caesar opens the door
gino marzzone is an old italian whose face is a mask of irritated indifference
roy his enormous driver is behind him
caesar smiles greeting them in italian with open arms
johnnie is the last inside
he has tape over his broken nose
he smiles and hugs caesar
you shouldnt have hit me
you want to get into this now
no no caesar
he smiles again patting him on the shoulder then throwing a fake punch
caesar sees gino with his bright italian smile flattering violet kissing her
you take care of this girl or i find out
you are as radiant as ever violet
as he bends to kiss her hand she sees caesar watching them
glenlivet right gino
ill have whatever violets drinking
im not drinking
then neither will i
this makes violet very uncomfortable
no ill have a tanqueray and tonic
caesar make that two tnts
caesars hand shakes as he pours ginos scotch
pacing in her socks corky tries to think through several possible situations
she stops staring at the bag of money
the idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers her
caesar hands violet and johnnie a drink
he stares at her
she stares back
roy violet pop caesar
caesar watches johnnie suspecting everything he does
johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular phone
no goddamned phones
caesar come here
we talk now
you too johnnie
each man sits on either side of gino
caesar look at me
johnnie tell me what happened
caesar you gotta do me a favor a personal favor
for me eh
you gotta start respecting johnnie the way you respect me
caesar sees johnnie smiling at him but when gino turns the smile disappears
and you johnnie
you gonna stop acting stupid
you gotta earn this respect that caesars gonna give
now wheres my money
corky drops a hefty bag knotted tight into an open five gallon bucket of paint
as she picks up a paint stick we see a second bag beside another bucket
she pushes the first bag down until it disappears enveloped by the milk white liquid
caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table
gino looks up at caesar very serious with his hand on the case
we know how this was done eh
yeah i know
he looks dead at johnnie
it wont happen again eh
caesar shakes his head
gino throws down the last of the scotch
we go now
jesus christ pop
you got two hours until your plane leaves
gino checks his watch shouting in italian
johnnie shouts back until gino throws up his hands refusing to listen
he gestures to his empty glass then folds his arms leaning back
caesar gets the bottle
so caesar what did it total out at
two point one seventy six
johnnie whistles as caesar pours gino another scotch
can you believe that violet
in italian tells him to shut up
come on pop all i want to know is one thing
just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it
i bet it wasnt a big deal
was it caesar
whats that johnnie
the money i bet it was nothing to get it clean after you made such a fucking big deal
johnnie what did i say
pop this is important to me
its a simple question
if he would just answer the question thats the end of it
where is this going johnnie
just admit it caesar
that you overreacted
that you lost it
it was your mistake
caesar sees it so clearly now
all right johnnie you want to play it this way i can play it this way
you want to know who made a mistake why dont you open the case
shut up violet
this is between me and johnnie
he pushes the case toward him
you want to do this now lets do it
open the case
open the fucking case
johnnie stares at him feeling that something is very wrong
thats right i know
i fucking know
open the case
wheres the key
you dont need a key
he tries but its locked
how the fuck can i open it
the same way you did before
what are you talking about
caesar smiles and tosses the key onto the table
there you go johnnie
he reaches for the key
caesar stands up and gives violet his drink
get me another
he can see the fear on her face as she goes to the bar
the key turns
one lock pops
then the other
tbe case opens like a scream and johnnie sees the newspaper
before anybody can move caesar whips around with his gun
roy jumps off his stool his drink crashing to the floor
dont fucking move
nobody can believe what is happening
what is this
ask your rat fuck son
what the fuck
caesar levels the gun
you dont think ill do it do you
i think youre fucking crazy
where is it
caesar i dont know what youre thinking here but if you dont put down that gun he stands up
gino your son stole this money to set me up and i can prove it
she doesnt know what to say
for christs sake johnnie do what he says
this isnt happening
caesar blows a hole in the couch right between johnnies legs
the next one blows off your dick
youre a dead man
a fucking dead man
where is it
gino jumps up
you aim a gun at me
do you know who i am
i am gino marzzone
he starts walking toward caesar
roy moves around for a good angle
sit down gino
no caesar gimme the gun
he backs up as gino walks straight to him
were family caesar
gimme the gun
give it to me
he reaches up and takes bold of the barrel
caesar looks resigned as he shuts his eyes
close on ginos hand holding the gun barrel as caesar fires
from behind the gun we watch ginos grip yanked free time melting away as he falls blood bubbling from his chest his eyes wide in disbelief
his body hits the floor and the room erupts
roy dives drawing his gun as caesar continues to fire pumping the trigger
violet drops behind the bar as jobnnie screams falling towards his father
blood spurts from roy as two bullets hit his gun clattering and sliding across the floor
johnnie lunges at caesar as caesar turns and fires hitting johnnie everywhere blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him
the gun continues to fire as corky clutches the phone whispering
this is an emergency
crunched down behind the bar violet listens to the only sound repeating in the unnatural quiet click
rising she peers over the edge of the bar
caesar is standing in the aftermath
his gun is still aimed at johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over
the bodies are still blood silently pooling around them
blinking the sweat from his eyes caesar sees violet
i had to do it violet
you saw it
i had no choice
it was johnnie
that lying fuck
he made me do it
he looks down at jobnnie hate rising like bile
you lying rat fuck
you think you can set me up
is that what you think
you stupid fuck
kicking the body be causes a series of sickening wet noises
im a dead man
im a dead man
guess again fuck face
whos the dead lying rat fuck
take another guess take another fucking guess
he stops panting unable to catch his breath
violet is afraid to even look at him
blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards
caesar tries to clear his head mopping the sweat from his face
he bends down and starts searching johnnies pockets
he finds his keys
what are you doing
lost in thought he goes to gino
throwing open the coat he sees the airplane ticket
there is a bullet hole in it
he checks the times and then his watch
maybe three hours
caesar what are you going to do
what do you think were going to do
we have to find the money
once we have the money then none of this ever happened
caesar you just killed gino marzzone
no i didnt
not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here
then they never showed up
what happened to them
i dont know
we may never know but im going to guess it was a job maybe the karpoli family
all part of the business
he picks up roys gun and stuffs it in his belt
we just got to find the money
once we do everything is going to be all right
in the distance the wail of a police siren can be heard
through the window they see a squad car lights blaring roll up in front of the building
he turns back to the carnage
caesar what are we going to do
theyre just cops
stall them as long as you can
caesar flies into action
grunting he hauls ginos body up drags it to the bathroom and throws it into the tub
he returns for johnnies body
standing near the bathroom corky hears the metal echo of the tub
looking at her tub she imagines what he is doing
through the wall she hears the door buzzer
the buzzer sounds again as violet sees him lift roys body
he heads back to the bathroom dropping roy onto the other two
the three bloody bodies fill the tub
we see johnnies arm hanging over the edge as caesar snaps the shower curtain around hiding them
this is the police maam
she cuts them off using the intercom
over her shoulder she sees caesar moving the furniture clearing the area around the heavy bloodstains
we had a report of gunfire so if you could gunfire
is this a joke
violet sees caesar hurry to his office
no joke maam
please open the door
how do i know you are cops
caesar seizes the beautiful oriental rug in his office and yanks it up overturning furniture
dragging it out he slams the door behind him
violet looks at caesar who is working with the calm single minded focus of a machine
maam you have to open the door
she buzzes them in as caesar throws the rug like someone making a bed letting it fall to the floor and cover most of the blood
the cops are waiting for the elevator
after a moment the door slides open
violet moves away from the intercom as caesar begins arranging the furniture on the rug
get me a wet towel
his words push her to the bathroom
stuffing a towel into the sink she turns on the water
she does not even look at the shower curtain
the elevator opens and the cops step out
caesar grabs the television remote hits on and jacks the volume until it is obviously loud
violet returns and he snatches the towel from her
as the two cops walk down the hall they hear the television
they look at each other already knowing what happened
like a maniac caesar wipes at any blood still visible until there is a knock on the door
he grabs violet by the arm
if youre thinking about doing something stupid remember i just killed gino marzzone
you understand what that means
theyre just cops
there is another knock much louder
violet goes to the door as caesar rips off his blood soaked jacket and shirt
he drops down behind the bar leaving the chain on violet opens the door
tbe cops smile
were for real
im sorry its just you hear stories
you did the right thing
crouching caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face
violet opens the door
caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink
just as the cops enter the living room caesar stands looking comfortable in no shirt with ice cubes in his hands
hey hey chicagos finest
he plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar hows it going tonight fellas
pretty good sir
caesar turns his head
im sorry i can only hear in this ear
tbe cops look at each other again
wiping his wet hand on his pants caesar shakes hands with each of them
im caesar and this here is my violet
they smile at violet as caesar puts his arm around her
violet said something about gunshots
violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt
yes sir a neighbor in the building called in
i think we know what happened
it was probably just the television
he looks at violet
honey why didnt you say something
turn it off
violet walks across the rug and turns off the tv
fuck this happened before
its this shitty ear
born with it
the batteries wore out in my aid
its all right sir
no big deal
hey can i get you guys a beer
not on duty sorry
but uh would you mind if i used your bathroom
caesars face tightens
yeah why not
its right there
he heads for the john
violet watches caesar back up to the bar moving behind it
im going to make myself a drink if thats okay
go right ahead sir
cop enters walking right past the shower curtain
we hear his sigh as he starts to piss
cop walks onto the rug looking around turning to violet
this is a beautiful place
she stares at his shoes on the rug
watching everything caesar takes a sip of his drink
he slips his gun out and holds it at his side
there is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine johnnies arm is hanging
slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic curtain where a drip of blood forms and plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor
close on the heel of the cops black shoe where we can almost see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug
is this a condo
everyone turns when cop busts out of the bathroom
okay lets roll
cop walks across the rug to the hardwood floor
he turns to caesar
try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around
corky hears the cop say goodbye to violet
the door closes
she isnt sure what she should do
over her shoulder she notes the bucket of paint
she lets the cops leave
caesar puts on a new shirt the gun stuffed in his pants
corky rises at the sound of caesars door closing
we track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the faint sounds of caesar and violets footsteps
as they pass by violet looks up to the door of the empty apartment straight at the peephole
empty apartment corky is pressed against the door eye at the peephole
she sees that violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak to each other with their eyes
caesar is on his knees searching under the seats of johnnies mercedes
unable to find the money he is ready to snap
from the main doors corky slips out of the building
hiding behind a column she sees violet and caesar across the lot
corky moves behind the parked cars the gun squeezed in her hand
violet edges away on the verge of running looking toward the busy street
standing caesar pounds on the car
caesar someone could see us out here
ignoring her be tries to think
still too far from them to do anytbing corky sees caesar slam the trunk
its got to be at his house
thats the only other place it could be
violet looks around the lot looking for some way out
corky can only watch as violet gets in and the car rips away
alone corky stands over the bucket of paint
she kicks it with her boot toe
two million dollars cork
two million dollars
she sighs wondering how long she can make herself wait
the bmw is parked in front
close on caesar as he rakes his sweaty hair back his face knotted in torment
okay i come in
he turns as if he just came in through the front door
we see johnnies home has been laid to waste
the furniture is broken cushions split open pictures shattered holes punched in the drywall even the carpeting has been torn up
caesar doesnt look much better
ive got the money
huddled in a corner violet watches him
i cant wait to see the look on caesars face when he finds out
caesar moves from the front door trying to get into johnnies head
now i dont have much time
he takes a couple of steps into the room
got to put it someplace safe
he looks at a closet
its gutted searched times already
a couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over turned rolltop desk
he starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the first time that it is destroyed
he is near the breaking point
his voice cracks
there is nowhere else to look
where did i put it
a terra cotta lamp sails across the room
wheres my fucking money
where the fuck is it
he smashes his forehead into the wall denting the drywall
he holds his head sinking to the ground
she sits next to him putting a hand lightly on his shoulder
its not here caesar
i dont know
it could be anywhere
we dont even know if he was alone
please caesar we dont have much time
lets get out of here
he knows what he has to do
digging through the debris he finds the phone
what are you doing
were going to need some time
who are you going to call
already dialing he does not answer caesar
ceaar takes a deep breath mustering composure
what the fuck time is it
mick i know its late but there is a problem
they havent shown up yet
they aint there
i dont know where they are
i even called over at johnnies but no answer
let me call around
ill see what i can do
dont go anywhere okay
okay sure mick
caesar you still got the money
caesar looks at violet
ive got the money
im staring right at it
ill call you
he hangs up
caesar drags himself in
violet closes the door behind them
caesar moves into the room where it happened
he is dizzy and confused and does not want to be here
violet turns him around
ill start packing
you know what you have to do
she turns him toward the bathroom
i can use johnnies car dump it in lake michigan
i need plastic bags
tape and rope
nodding he heads for the kitchen
violet enters and goes straight for the phone
she looks at the blank wall as she dials
the phone rings
when corky answers violet almost collapses with relief
oh thank god
im still here
i was so afraid you
you dont quit on me violet and i wont quit on you
a box of hefty bags tucked under his arm a coil of clothesline in his hand caesar searches through several cabinets
violet glances at the door
corky it worked
hes going to run
he needs to take care of the bodies to buy himself time but as soon as he leaves its over
corky falls against the wall
just a little longer and its ours
mumbling to himself caesar walks out of the kitchen heading for the bedroom
violet reaches out and touches the wall as if she were touching corky
corky i have to tell you something corky turns to the wall
i know violet
her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact same place
its why im still here
suddenly violet hears caesar
as he opens the door she slams down the phone
the line cuts off
fear and panic paralyze violet as caesar drops everything grabbing for his gun
who was that
he levels the gun at her
who the fuck was that
she stands and be rushes at her grabbing her by the throat
was that mickey
did you call mickey
she shakes her head and he throws her on the bed
the gun aimed at her he picks up the phone and hits the redial
unsure of what happened corky hears the phone ring and answers it on reflex
listening she waits
caesar listens waiting as long as he can
is that you
corky hangs up jumping away from the wall
caesar hits the redial again
panicking corkydoesnt answer it but as it rings very loud in the empty apartment she realizes her mistake
turning slowly toward the wall caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment
corky rips the plug out of the wall
the line goes dead
who is that
who is over there
she tries to get away but he grabs her and slaps her to the ground
corky hears violet scream and that does it
gun in hand she flies at the door
the door to the empty apartment slams shut and caesar hearing it starts to run but violet reaches out catching his ankle sending him crashing to the dresser
the door to caesars apartment is locked
corky falls to one knee whipping two lock picks from her earlobe
caesar raises the gun to pistol whip violet and she screams
working the lock corky hears violets scream cut off
she feels the tumblers click and rotates the cylinder
a shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears something that sounds like footsteps
corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole
she can almost feel caesar beyond the door but grits her teeth and turns the doorknob
the door cracks open and corky slips in gun first
as she moves into the room we see caesar behind her
he puts his gun to her head
drop the fucking gun or die
rising from her crouch she turns and he recognizes her
holy fucking christ
you gotta be kidding me
he starts to laugh when she strikes knocking the gun she punches him slamming him back against the door as she twists diving grabbing her gun just as he steps
and kicks her full in the face
still unconscious corkys head jerks reacting to the kick
we see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick split the skin
she is again swimming toward consciousness
we hear water splash her face flinching as we move closer the sounds and voices echoing
come on you fucking dyke
we hear caesar slapping her
corkys face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink open
coming into focus is caesar standing over her with an empty glass in one hand
except for the gag she is bound as we have seen her bound in the closet
caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head
i know everything now so i dont want to hear any i dont know bullshit you understand
she sees violet on the bed also bound hand and foot
god i should have seen this coming
the second i met you i knew it
everyone knows your kind cant be trusted
fucking queers make me sick
the gun digs into her cheek
but you tried to fuck the wrong guy
and i swear to you that im going to kill you for it
he thumbs back the hammer
where is the money
dont tell him shut up violet
he cant kill you he aims the gun at violet
not until he has the money
he fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her
his point made he puts the gun back to corkys head
now where the fuck is my money
where is it
either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face
blood temperature rising again caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it
caesar stop acting like an asshole and think dont try to tell me what to do
you need the money just like we do
shut up violet
let us go and well make a deal
he rushes at her grabbing a fistful of her hair
shut the fuck up
he looks at corky
what did you do to her
this isnt my violet
he looks at her as if unable to recognize her what did she do to you
everything you couldnt
he shoves her down
you ungrateful bitch
you had nothing before i met you
you were nothing
he stomps around the room
who gave you this place
he throws open the closet
who gave us all of this
i gave you everything
i gave you this life
i made you violet
i saved you
he seems to believe what he is saying
i saved you
what a load of crap
look at yourself caesar
youre a thug
you launder money for the mob
you rent women like you rented this apartment
he doesnt want to hear this
you dont even know me
you used me caesar just like i used you
all part of the business
you betrayed me
you murdered gino
i had to
you made me
bullshit you killed him
you did it because you couldnt stand the thought of johnnie fucking you
he slaps her
okay you want business ill give you the fucking business
he leans closer
im going to make you beg just like shelly did
just like shelly
he storms out of the room
corky looks up at violet
im sorry corky
dont be sorry
she pulls at the ropes as violet slides off the bed
caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers that mickey used to cut off shellys finger
the two women are back to back fingers working at each others knots when caesar bursts into the room
oh no no no
grabbing corky by the boots he drags her and flips her so that she can now see violet
he drops down onto violet putting the clippers in front of her face
hey violet you remember these
her eyes widen with terror
she starts to scream when he stuffs a towel in her mouth
laying against violet he turns to corky
im going to start with her so youll get a good idea whats coming
he takes hold of violets pinky finger stretching it out
im going to ask you where the money is
every time you dont give me an answer im going to cut off one finger
when i reach ten then ill start with you
he puts the finger between the blades
where is the money
corky sees violet thrashing helplessly
she has no choice
her mouth opens as the door buzzer rings
caesar is distracted trying to think who it could be
he sees the phone where he dropped it lying off the hook
the door buzzer rings again more insistently
corky sees him momentarily unnerved
he looks back at her
i said where he starts to cut and corky screams no
ill tell you
he stops the door buzzing continuously
its over there in the empty apartment
as she speaks the sound of the door buzzer changes
i put it inside one of the paint drums
he is not looking at her listening he realizes that mickey is buzzing the other apartments
caesar stands as the buzzing stops
he pulls out his gun and aims it at corky
i promised i would kill you
he cocks it
you cant kill me yet
i could be lying
his hand start to shake with ftustration
he is beginning to hate this woman more than he ever hated johnnie
taking a deep breath he eases back the hammer
youre going to wish to god you hadnt done that
he kicks her again snapping her head back
after he leaves violet looks over and sees corky lying unconscious
caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it is locked
at the end of the hall the elevator dings
just as the door opens caesar jumps back into his apartment
son of a bitch
his mind a racing blur he locks the door and runs back to the bedroom
with another towel he gags corky and drags her into the closet
in her pocket he finds the key
he closes the doors then hangs up the phone
grunting he hauls violet up over his shoulder when there is a knock on the door
carrying violet he hurries to the kitchen where he throws corkys gun into the freezer
mickey is banging on the door as caesar heads for the bathroom
dropping violet onto the floor he reaches behind the curtain and turns on the shower
mickey will get in
i know he will
we hear the water hitting the bodies while caesar starts tearing off his clothes
i can kill you right now if thats what you want
if you want to live then you have to help me
i need you to make mickey believe that everything is normal
he picks up his gun
tell me do you want to live
she stares hard at him and his gun then nods
we move toward the door as the lock clicks open
violets hands are untied
she pulls off the gag and the ropes at her feet
naked caesar sticks his head under the shower spray wetting everything
still dripping caesar walks into the room a towel wrapped around his waist another towel in his hand
mickey and lou are standing in the middle of the room
caesar holds his chest laying it on a bit thick
holy fuck mickey
you scared the shit outta me
he sees they both are holding their guns
what is this
what are you two doing sneaking in here with your peckers in your hands
you gonna do me mick
is that it
mickey smiles putting his gun away
there was no answer
i thought i heard someone knocking
i was buzzing i was knocking but i guess you couldnt hear me on account of being in the shower
yeah it was violets idea
i was so wound up about gino she was trying to help me relax
that violet is one nice lady
wish someone would help me relax
shit mick come on in let me get you a drink
sit down lou
behind the bar he sets down the towel be was holding and we see the gun hidden inside it
violet watches through a sliver of open door her mind already working
caesar is making the drinks
we was worried about you cease
we went over to johnnies place just to check it out and it was busted up bad
caesar hands him a drink
i started thinking maybe its about the money so i call you but all i get is the busy signal
i figure the phone is off the hook thats why i come rushing over here
oh christ the phone
that was a fucking stupid thing to do wasnt it
hey if violet was helping me relax id probably do the same thing
mickey smiles as he sips his drink
violet stands and goes to the shower curtain
she reaches in and turns off the water
steadying herself she pulls back the curtain exposing the wet bloody bodies
mickey is looking at the furniture
cease can i ask you something
whyd you move all the furniture around
the knot in caesars stomach tightens
let me guess
that was violets idea too
he laughs and lou laughs with him
actually yeah she was nervous about gino coming wanted everything to look right
you know women mick
they make us do stupid things dont they
caesar smiles feebly
violet has pulled up johnnies body and is digging through his coat pockets searching for something
mickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table
is that the money
yeah thats it
caesar puts his hand inside the towel as mickey walks across the rug
that fucking shelly
i gotta hand it to the guy but jesus if i were him i would have bailed a long time ago
i mean how much money does a man need
talking to lou be picks up the case and walks back somehwo moving right between the wet spots
i remember i was just staring at all this goddamn money shelly down on his knees and the next thing i know johnnie just blows his head off
he slaps the case up onto the bar
what a fucking mess
johnnies laughing his ass off and thats when caesar lost it and boom
he coldcocked him
fucking coldcocks johnnie marzzone
he thumbs the latches but the case is still locked
hey caesar wheres the key
the key yeah the keys in my pants in the bathroom
fuck it i dont need the key
caesar takes the smallest breath
i didnt need a key to get in here did i
he pulls out a lock pick and starts working the lock
the muscles in caesars forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his gun
he is slipping toward that same desperate choice
he is going to attack when across the room the phone rings
everyone looks at it
who the hell could that be
the phone is near the couch
caesar doesnt want to let go of the gun
the phone continues to ring
you gonna answer it
violet has johnnies cellular phone
watching through the cracked door violet sees caesar cross to answer the phone
this is gino
caesar looks toward the bathroom
youre blowing your only chance
act like im gino
caesars eyes light up
holy shit i dont believe it
weve been going crazy over here gino
mickey jumps up
where in the hell is he
we were in a car accident they were in a car accident
but everybody is all right
theyre all fine
just bruises and shit
now you listen to me asshole i know your gun is behind the bar
un fucking believable
i called those highway patrol dumb fucks

violet has her robe over her dress wrapping her hair in a towel making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden
i want whats mine half the money
we get rid of mickey no one else dies
say yes i understand
yes i understand
tell them im at st
marys off the kennedy in the waiting room but stay on the phone until i come out

out of the corner of his eye he watches violet come out of the bathroom
marys off the kennedy sure
mickey sees violet
what are you doing here
violet its gino and johnnie
they were in a car accident
oh my god

i think everything is okay
caesar hangs up
theyre at st
marys in the waiting room
mick is already on the way
i cant fit them all in my car so give me your keys
you drive my car lou
caesar sees violet walking toward the kitchen
sure mickey sure
she stops looking straight at the freezer
go grab my car keys from my pants in the bathroom
she turns to him
please help us out mickey wants to get going
she turns to the bathroom
they might want to go straight to the airport and back to miami so i better take this
he grabs the briefcase
you got the key
where corky remains bound still unconscious
we hear the name echo in her head
suddenly her eyes blink open
her eyes blink again as she tries to focus
violet hands mickey the keys for the car and the case
he kisses her on the cheek
call me as soon as you get him
leave your phone on the hook
mickey and lou leave
violet is staring at caesar standing near the door
in his right hand he is holding the other towel
now thats teamwork
i should have let him kill you
you know he would have done you too
i knew i couldnt trust you
he drops the towel raising the gun
i said id let you live and i will
he smiles again
corky is wide awake thrashing mad biting her gag struggling to get free
caesar pulls his pants on
time to find out if the dyke was stupid enough to lie
caesar drags violet througb the front door
the closet doors burst open as corky fights her way out
caesar sees the buckets of paint
he rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over
paint spills out across the floor
suddenly corky stops something has caught her eye
we drop down focusing on what she is staring at the clippers
he kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with the rushing flow of paint
he turns to violet who is already running out the door
violet turns down the hall bare feet beating against the floor
caesar slices out of the room behind her
he aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency door
she flies hands on the rail spiraling down each flight as he charges after her
straining corkys fingers curl around the handle of the clippers
violet smashes through the door but instead of turning to the main doors she runs straight for the elevators
she pounds the button and waits
come on please
she hears caesar coming just as the elevator opens
caesar crashes out of the stair door running toward the exit
when he doesnt see violet he turns to the sound of the elevator and catches a glimpse of her as the doors close
oh you bitch
you fucking bitch
taking a really deep breath he throws open the door to the stairs
violet takes johnnies cellular phone from the robe pocket and dials a number
mickey answers on the car phone
oh god mickey
whispering she acts terrified
he made me help him mickey god i was so afraid
it was caesar all caesar
you have to help me
hes coming oh god
she hangs up eyes blazing
sweat pouring off him caesar climbs the stairs
the elevator opens violet bolts out
she runs down the hall past the empty apartment back to her door
she rushes to the bedroom where she finds the coils of cut rope
she looks at the wall separating the apartment
caesar half falls out of the stair door drenched with sweat
gun ready caesar throws open the door
spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint but the money is gone
leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag
the tracks lead to the bathroom
caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to corkys empty boots
over his shoulder we see corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench
at the last second he is able to duck falling to the ground as the doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch
before he can recover and shoot she brings the wrench down on his arm
he screams as the gun hits the floor
she kicks it sending it skidding hydroplaning across the paint pool to the other side leaving a jet trail of white swirls and spirals on the wood floor
they fight corky raining blows onto his back and flailing arm until he catches her foot flipping her as he clambers up
scrambling across the paint slipping crawling for the gun when violet bursts in pointing the gun from the freezer
caesar on hands and knees looks at her then at his gun still out of reach
its over caesar
i called mickey
hes on his way
violet stands for long time the gun trained carefully on him as he rises from the floor
panting caesar watches her like a mad dog
get out of here caesar
if you want to live you had better start running
all these years and you still dont know me violet
she glances down and sees the paint covered gun
but i know you
he turns to the gun
what are you going to do v
kill me in cold blood
i dont think so
ill tell you why
if you had it in you to pull that trigger you would have done it a long time ago
if i was you i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home
but you didnt and i know why because you dont want to kill me
do you v
no i know you dont
caesar you dont know shit
violet fires the bullet hits caesar in the shoulder knocking him off balance
another doubles him over as blood speckles the pool of paint
she empties the gun into him
his body arcs back falling splashing into the paint
caesars blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening white
it is empty and clean
in the bedroom only a few hangers are left dangling in the open closet
mickey is standing with violet next to his lincoln town car
i will never understand it mickey
you didnt even call the police
i told you the family doesnt want the police around
we want to take care of it ourselves and we will
ill find him
i swear i will
i know you will
sure youre going to be okay
i mean if youre having second thoughts my offer still stands
thanks mickey but i need to get out you know
get away from all of this
thanks for everything
she hugs him and he kisses her
then he gets in his car
violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free
corky sitting on stoop patient like a rock
she looks up as she hears high heels and smiles at violet standing there new outfit
corky stands in front of her
howd it go
im here arent i
i guess we should get out of here
corky digs out alarm keys aims fires
violet turns looks
violet turns to corky eyebrow cocked
thought we might need a getaway car
smiles they get in
corky admires truck
you know what the difference is between us violet
lean for kiss as dolly in
