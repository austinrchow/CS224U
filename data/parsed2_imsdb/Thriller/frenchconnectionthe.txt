who just fired
a large man in a santa claus suit and white beard is entertaining a group of black children
he leads them in the singing of a christmas carol hark the herald angels sing
the man is detective first grade jimmy doyle
his attention is split between the children and the activity inside the bar
the place is crowded with mid day drinkers
dimly outlined at the far end of the bar are two black men involved in some kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for money
as the transaction seems to be completed cut to santa claus doyle starts to ring his big christmas bell above the singing
the bell is a signal to detective second grade buddy russo
at this moment russo is in the clothes of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog wagon
at the ringing of doyles bell he takes off his apron leaves the wagon and runs toward the bar
as russo passes him the guy in the brown coat
russo enter the bar on the run
he stops and looks over the room
there are twenty or thirty men at the bar at least ten are wearing brown coats
the two men involved in the deal see russo and start to run
one the buyer takes off out of the back door
the other the pusher jumps over the bar and heads for the front entrance
the pusher dashes out past santa claus doyle
russo follows him and all three give chase
three figures running down a new york tenement alley the first in flight the others in pursuit
we pick up the incredible clutter of such an alley mounts of rusting beer cans paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open old bed springs burned out mattresses etc
close shot of black pusher tripping on the tangle of trash going up against the wall in his stumble face toward the camera and the figures of russo and doyle
leaping upon him from off camera
there is a blur or fast struggle as doyle and russo try to get his arms and put him against the wall
black pusher writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his hand plunging rapidly into russos left forearm
son of a bitch
the words are both warning and a grunt of pain
as russo takes the blade and utters the words we simultaneously go to doyle crouching and snatching his
out of the right ankle holster
close shot of doyle and the black pusher doyle pistol whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of the gun to the pushers head
doyle continues to beat the man mercilessly into submission
shot of black pusher sitting between doyle and russo
doyle is at the wheel
black pusher is sitting on his hands wrists manacled behind him his head down and dripping blood onto the jacket and the canary yellow turtleneck
all three are breathing hard
whats your name asshole
fuck you santa claus
doyle hits him across the face
your name is willie craven
black pusher doesnt look up
whos your connection willie
whats his name
who killed the old jew in the laundromat
black pushers brow furrows looks up just a little

man im clean

we had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me youre clean
who stuck up the laundromat
how about that time you were picking your feet in poughkeepsie
the black pushers eyes go to russo in panic looking for relief from the pressure of the inquisition
in pain you better give me the guy who got the old jew or you better give me something or youre just a memory in this town
thats a lot o shit
i didnt do nothin
the black pushers eyes are on doyle frozen in confusion and fear
you put a shiv in my partner

all winter i gotta listen to him gripe about his bowling scores
now im gonna bust your ass for those three bags then im gonna nail you for pickin your feet in poughkeepsie
doyle and russo standing side by side on the front steps of the old first precinct on the lower east side of manhattan
russo has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape
the sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood stained bandage on the left forearm
youre a dumb guinea
howd i know he had a knife
never trust a nigger
he coulda been white
never trust anybody
you goin sick

russo nods in acceptance of the remark
the easy synical rapport between them is obvious they are partners in a business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is part of the inventory
lets popeye around the chez for a half hour catch the end of the show and a couple drinks
some other time jimmy im beat
doyle reaches into the right side pocket of buddys suitcoat for a cigarette and matches
he lights up two in the pause sticks one in russos mouth
come on one drink

whip it out
titles over a close shot of a chorus line with lots of tits and ass and lean long legs in a brassy blare of music
we zoom back to the area where doyle and russo are beginning to occupy a table
russo takes the seat on the right eyes immediately on all that ginch while doyle standing gives their order
we do not hear the dialogue but doyle asks russo what he wants buddy looks up and says cinzano
doyle turns and says two of these
doyle slips into the chair opposite russo and the titles roll on
unlike russo who is concentrating on the girls doyle is digging the room and the people who occupy the tables in it as if he is the sort of man
who cannot relax until he knows who is around him why they are there
a long view from doyles position of the room a quick certain survey that stumbles twice on laughter that seems too raw and then over a flurry of activity by
waiters and captains serving a table on the main floor
doyles attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that emanate from the same large table
i make at least two junk connections at that table in the corner
the guy is the stripe combo i know him too
hey i thought we come for a drink
a long view of the table with doyle and russo very close foreground left and right
doyle is leaning on an elbow

russos eyes come off the show
it is a direct line from doyles gaze to the round ruddy and arrogant face of sal boca the apparent host of the table of eight men and women the
men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars of blue or white lace trimmed shirts the women in a mixture of pant suits and catskills cocktail party dresses their hair coiffed towers
check the bread
he spreads it like the russians are in jersey
he probably sells insurance
owns a chicken farm in hackensack
zoom in slowly on sal as he deals tips and orders
through doyles eyes we go from guest to guest at sals table taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and laugh lost in the show chatter
doyle finishing his drink still looking at the table
dig whos just come over
the creep on the end
the camera pans down the table to dig the creep on the end

doyle is at the wheel russo packed uncomfortably into the corner at doyles right
seventy five yards away on the other side of the street the canopied entrance of the club
a continental is parked in front of the club
the driver leaning on a fender talking with the doorman
doyle frisks his own pockets for a cigarette coming up with a collection of laundry slips crumpled notes toothpicks and matches
one of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch a slip bearing the name of a girl
his attention is really on the entrance of the club and both his conversation and the cigarette business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting through the stakeout
he stuffs the cards back into his pocket
handing him a cigarette a and a thats all youre interested in arrests and ass
as soon as doyle has finished lighting the cigarette sal and his party come bubbling out of the club noisily a little drunkenly
sal waves to the attentive doorman
doyle close leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand on the ignition key

at the front an auctioneer stands at a lectern
to his left sits a clerk at a small table
the auctioneer wears a sweater and hat

pick up charnier marie and maurice lavalle as the camera plays over the bridge in french its beautiful
it was built in and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world
the arch is still the largest in the world
who financed it
two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from new england to the south
it was actually the first railroad through new york city
why is it called hellgate
the river at this point is the most dangerous on the east coast
years ago hundreds of ships went down here
if this bridge were in europe it would be on every tourists sight seeing list
most new yorkers never notice it most americans have never heard of it
look how gracefully they conceived that arch
like a bowstring
it was built from both ends
with no support in the middle
alain is the only man i know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman
not any woman marie
charnier marie and la valle walking
