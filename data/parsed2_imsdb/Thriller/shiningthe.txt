wendy sitting cam
r reading book
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter
sure danny it will be lots of fun
yeah i guess so
anyway theres hardly anybody to play with around here
yeah i know
it always takes a little time to make new friends
danny eating sandwich
yeah i guess so
what about tony
hes looking forward to the hotel i bet
danny while eating sandwich wiggles forefinger of his l
hand and speaks with different voice
no i aint mrs
oh come on tony
dont be silly
danny wiggles forefinger of l
hand and speaks with different voice
i dont want to go there mrs
well how come you dont want to go
danny wiggles forefinger of l
hand and speaks with different voice
i just dont
well lets just wait and see
were all gonna have a real good time
jack over ullman seated at desk
bill watson enter office
jack rises and shakes hands with him
bill id like you to meet jack torrance
how do you do
bill how do you do
pleased to meet you
pleasure to meet you
grab a chair bill and join in
watson jack sit down
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter
i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through
jack is a schoolteacher
eh formerly a school teacher
what line of work are you in now
im a writer um
teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet
well this ought to be quite a change for you
well im looking for a change
our people in denver recommended jack very highly and for once i agree with them
lets see where were we
i was about to explain that eh
our season here runs from oh may th to october th and then we close down completely until the following may
do you mind if i ask why you do that
it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic
oh it sure would be but the problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to the sidewinder open
its a mile stretch of road gets an average of feet of snow during the winter and theres just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear
when the place was built in there was very little interest in winter sports and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty
ullman over watson jack
well its certainly got plenty of that
and did they give you any idea in denver about what the job entails
only in a very general way
the winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is to
to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur
and this consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so that the
elements cant get a foothold
well that sounds fine to me
ullman grunts off
physically its not a very demanding job
the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh
the tremendous sense of isolation
well that just happens to be exactly what im looking for
im outlining a new writing project and eh
five months of peace is just what i want
thats very good jack because eh
for some people eh solitude and isolation
can of itself be a problem
not for me
how about your wife and son
how do you think theyll take to it
theyll love it
well before i turn you over to bill there is one other thing i think we should talk about
i dont want to sound melodramatic but it is something thats
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job
i dont suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of
jack shakes his head
i dont believe they did
well my predecessor in this job hired a man named charles grady as the winter caretaker
he came up here with his wife and two little girls of about eight or ten
and he had a good employment record good references and from what ive been told i mean he seemed like a completely normal individual
but at some point during the winter he must have suffered some kind of a complete mental breakdown
he ran amok and eh
killed his family with an axe stacked them neatly in one of the rooms in the west wing and then he um
then he put eh both barrels of his shotgun in his mouth
ullman sitting behind desk
the police eh
they thought that it was what the old timers used to call cabin fever a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are shut in together over long
periods of time
well that is eh quite a story
yes it is
oh its still hard for me to believe that it actually happened here but it did and eh
i think you can appreciate why i wanted to tell you about it
ah i certainly can and eh
i also understand why your people in denver left it for you to tell me
well obviously some people can be put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened
well you can rest assured mr
ullman thats not going to happen with me and eg as far as my wife is concerned i am sure shell be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it
shes a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict
shooting through open door danny standing on stool at basin
tony do you think daddy will get the job
yeah he did
hes gonna phone wendy up in a few minutes to tell her
wendy back to camera washing dishes at sink
phone rings off
she dries her hand and puts carton in fridge
then moves l r into living room camera pans with her
she picks up telephone receiver
into phone hello
jack leaning on counter at reception desk speaking into phone
into phone hi babe
over phone hi hon
hows it going
into phone great
look im at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through
i dont think i can get home before nine or ten
wendy sitting on back of chair phone to ear
into phone sounds like you got the job
jack leaning on reception desk with phone to ear
into phone right its a beautiful place
you and danny are gonna love it
danny standing on stool by basin
he is reflected in mirror
camera tracks in on his reflection in mirror
tony why dont you want to go to the hotel
danny wiggles forefinger
i dont know
you do too know now come on tell me
danny wiggles forefinger
i dont want to
danny wiggles forefinger
now tony tell me
shooting towards doors of lifts
blood gushes in from l
side of lift and in from corridors l
of lift doors surging towards camera
two little grady girls holding hands
blood gushing in from corridors l r of lift doors and surging towards camera
blood gushing in from corridors l r of lift doors and surging forward
the blood gushes up into camera lens causing black out
now hold your eyes still so that i can see
doctor bending over danny lying on top of his bed
she is examining his eyes
wendy standing at foot of bed
thats good now the other one
doctor straightens up
she puts instrument away in case and closes it
then she sits on bed beside danny
now danny when you were brushing your teeth do you remember if you smelled anything funny or saw any bright flashing lights or anything at all strange
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth
doctor sitting on bed beside danny
wendy standing at foot of bed
whats the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth
mommy saying wake up wake up wake up danny wake up
doctor sitting on bed beside danny
wendy standing at foot of bed
now danny can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth
talking to tony
is tony one of your animals
its the little boy that lives in my mouth
tony is his imaginary friend
oh if you were to open your mouth now could i see tony
because he hides
where does he go
to my stomach
does tony ever tell you to do things
i dont want to talk about tony anymore
doctor sitting on bed beside danny
she pats his leg and stands up
wendy at foot of bed
all right danny
doctor puts case and stethoscope in her shoulder bag
now im going to ask you to do me a favor and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day
do i have to
yes id like you to
were just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk then ill come back and check on you okay
wendy doctor move r l to open door
doctor goes into the corridor
doctor standing in corridor
wendy moves out of dannys room and closes the door
she turns to doctor
shall we go into the living room
doctor wendy walk forward along the corridor camera tracks back before them and pans r l with them to living room
wendy points to sofa
doctor moves to sofa and sits down wendy sits in chair cam
torrance i dont think you have anything to worry about
im quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny
oh yeah he seems absolutely fine now but you should have seen him
doctor over wendy
doctor leans back on sofa
oh i know
kids can scare you to death but believe me these episodes are not at all uncommon and they look much worse than they are
wendy over doctor
but eh what was the matter with him
torrance most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained
they are brought on by emotional factors and they rarely occur again
theyre more akin to auto hypnosis a kind of self induced trance
if it re occurs which i doubt m
wendy takes cigarette out of packet
you can always think about having some tests done
wendy holds cigarette packet out towards doctor
no thank you
she puts packet down on table
im sure youre right
she lights cigarette from lighter
have you been in boulder long mrs
only about three months
eh were from vermont
my husband was teaching school there
did the appearance of dannys imaginary friend
wendy over doctor
did tonys first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here
no um lets see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school
doctor over wendy
did he adjust well to school
wendy she shakes her head
he didnt like it too much at first and then he had an injury so we kept him out for a while and yeah i
i guess thats about the time when i first noticed that he was talking to tony
doctor over wendy
what sort of injury did he have
ah he dislocated his shoulder
how did he manage to do that
well its just one of those things
purely an accident um
my husband had oh
been drinking and he came home about three hours late so he wasnt exactly in the greatest mood that night
and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room
and my husband grabbed his arm you know and pulled him away from them
its just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child you know in a park or on the streets but on this particular occasion my husband
used too much strength and he injured dannys arm
anyway something good did come out of it all because he said wendy im never gonna touch another drop and if i do you can leave me and he didnt
and he hasnt had any alcohol in eh five months

hey wasnt it around here that the donner party got snowbound

there were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times
they got snowbound one winter in the mountains
they had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive

as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel ive ever seen
oh this old place has had an illustrious past
in its heyday it was one of the stopping places for the jet set they reach corner and turn walking towards camera

when was the overlook built
ullman leads wendy jack watson l r along front of hotel camera tracks with them

the site is supposed to be located on an indian burial ground and i believe they actually had to repel a few indian attacks as they were building it
ullman points to red snowcat at entrance of garage

they walk towards snowcat
thats fine because basically the snowcat operates very much like a car and it wont take you long to get the hang of it
ullman jack watson wendy walk forward along corridor camera tracks back before them

we always remove all the booze from the premises when we shut down he points to shuttered bar
that reduces the insurance that we normally have to carry

halloran looking down cam
do you know how i knew your name was doc
danny over halloran danny looking at halloran
you know what im talking about dont you
danny over halloran
danny looking at halloran
i can remember when i was a little boy my grandmother and i could hold conversations entirely without ever opening our mouths
she called it shining and for a long time i thought it was just the two of us that had the shine to us
just like you probably thought you was the only one
but there are other folks though mostly they dont know it or dont believe it
how long have you been able to do it
halloran danny sitting at table
why dont you want to talk about it
im not supposed to
who says you aint supposed to
tonys the little boy who lives in my mouth
is tony the one that tells you things
how does he tell you things
halloran danny sitting at table
its like i go to sleep and he shows me things but when i wake up i cant remember everything
does your mum and dad know about tony
do they know he tell you things
has tony ever told you anything about this place
about the overlook hotel
danny over halloran
i dont know
now think real hard doc
danny over halloran
maybe he showed me something
try to think what it was
danny over halloran
halloran are you scared of this place
shooting across table onto halloran danny
no im scared of nothing here
its just that you know some places are like people some shine and some dont
i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it thats like shining
is there something bad here
well you know doc when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind
say like is someone burns toast
well maybe things that happened
leave other kinds of traces behind
not things that anyone can notice but things that people who shine can see
just like they can see things that havent happened yet
well sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago
i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel over the years and not all of them was good
what about room
youre scared of room aintcha
no i aint
halloran what is in room
there aint nothing in room but you aint got no business going in there anyway so stay out
you understand stay out
