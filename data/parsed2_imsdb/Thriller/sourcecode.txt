written by ben ripley darkness
a sound slowly builds the rhythmic rocking of a trains wheels over railroad tracks
colter jolts awake
sunlight hits his face
a stunned beat
slowly he turns his head to one side
filling most of the seats
office workers on their morning commute into a city
turning the other way hes confronted with a window
trees flash by splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic strobe pattern
colter looks to be thirty years old
a military buzz cut
a disciplined physique lean and spare almost gaunt
skin burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun
his expression prematurely aged by combat is perpetually wary sometimes predatory accustomed to trouble
despite his military bearing colter wears a button down shirt and navy sports coat
on his wrist is a digital watch
it reads a
a strange creeping panic
he has no idea where he is
the train hurls straight at us
new angle skimming alongside as the train twists and turns sucking up track feet yards miles of it
beneath it the curving rails which the rushing train barely seems to touch
they vibrate with an eerie dulcimer hum
colter hasnt moved
by his side he sees a canvas messenger bag
is that his
tentatively he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside
a red apple rolls against two library books
the bags leather name tag reads sean fentress
its not coming back to him
this whole experience is starting to freak him out
he catches the scent of something
a passenger walks by with a steaming cup of coffee
two rows back an overweight man opens a can of soda
sitting opposite colter facing him is a woman in her late twenties christina
in contrast to the corporate suits around her her appearance is thrift store funky black nail polish dark lipstick black hair with blue streaks a button down blouse edged in
black funeral lace with silver skull and bones cufflinks
shes busy writing in a journal
she looks up
what is this
where am i
looks out the window almost at newark
goes back to her journal
its more of a hell hole
but colter still doesnt understand
he gets up
nausea slams into him
he hangs on to the seat
i think im going to puke
gestures alarmed okay bathrooms that way
colter looks down the aisle hesitating
colter eases himself into the aisle
totters down the length of the car until he finds the restroom
the door is locked
the latch reads occupied
bracing himself he lurches forward into
its a mirror image of the first car
but no the passengers are different
beside him theres a small door
thinking its the bathroom he instead opens it to find a conductors compartment
a cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors
a heavy set conductor stands in the aisle
a jangling of keys
colter just stares at him
may i see your ticket
the last thing on his mind
bewildered he searches his pockets
i dont think i
have to write you up then
he pulls out a citation pad
from inside his sports coat he pulls out a train ticket
the conductor snips his ticket and brushes past
wait a sec
im a little out of it here
wheres this train headed
why would he be going to new york
how can this be happening
fear starts to grip him as the hallucination simply continues
do you know where i got on
the conductor examines his ticket again
bout ten minutes back
but ive never been to princeton junction
i dont remember waking up or buying a ticket or getting on the train or anything else
its just a blank
the jaded conductor moves on
colter is alone with his confusion
takes a deep breath
the nausea has eased slightly
youre gonna figure this out
entering the first car again
the rows of passengers
must be at least forty people
as he walks back up the aisle he looks from face to face a pale computer engineer reviews some documents
a forty something secretary does a crossword puzzle
derek a stock broker type talks on his cell phone trust me by one oclock the bridge is going to be jammed
a college student slumped against a window eyes shut listens to an mp player
an old man with a faded wool suit clutches a cane
a backpacker female european s hiking boots examines a guidebook
a dowdy officer manager type sorts supermarket coupons into a tabbed file box
an african american executive reads a newspaper
none of them pays any attention to colter
a whoosh of air he turns to an air conditioning vent
the hiss of air sound sinister
like the exhalations of a creature
he looks to see a woman filing her nails
every detail every sensory impression seems heightened near the point of overload
he reaches christina again
eases back in the seat across from her
she writes in her journal ignoring him
theres something else in his sports coat
he turns it over a few times inspecting it
pulls out a drivers license
another mans face is in the photo
the name on the license reads sean fentress
the same name as on the messenger bag
the street address on the license reads alexander road princeton junction new jersey
who the hells that
and why does he have this guys wallet
he leans forward to speak with christina again
she lowers her journal annoyed
we see she hasnt been writing but drawing
a well executed sketch of a face
why do you keep calling me maam
how old do you think i am anyway
im having a little problem here
im trying not to freak out but i think somethings happened to me
like total memory loss
i dont know how i got here
so you drank too much last night
so did i
unfortunately i remember the whole thing
thats not it
im a pilot
i fly helicopters in iraq
im in the army
she waits for more
as if hes telling a joke
i was on a mission
right before i woke up here i was in the middle of a mission
unsure of himself
boy you really did drink a lot last night
im telling you the truth
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
the train begins to slow down
a few people begin to get up
the platform of newark station slides into view
these arent my clothes
and this wallet here
he holds up the drivers license
one final attempt to convince her
you see this
this isnt me
of course it is
take a look in the mirror good sir
she goes back to her sketchbook
determined not to be interrupted again
anxiety ripples through colter
this cant be happening
the train lurches to a stop
colter gets up
through the windows a few passengers disembark onto the platform derek the old man the college kid and guzman a middle eastern man who hurries past all of them towards
the station building
colter only half notices all this
hes intent on reaching the trains bathroom the door of which is now open
doors are closing
christina watches colter go
this is a new york bound train
next stop new york penn station
the train begins moving
colter reaches the bathroom
a fluorescent light flutters on as colter shuts the door
hes in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in stainless steel
he shouts in surprise
eyes locked on staring back is sean fentresss face
not his own
hes frozen there
seized by cosmic panic
he slaps himself in the face
the restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train obliging him to hang on
this isnt a dream
at least not one he can wake up from
the other guys face stares back at him
blinks when he blinks
warehouses go by in a blur
the train is entering new jerseys industrial zones on the outskirts of new york city
from her seat christina stares at the messenger bag which colter left behind
then up at the closed restroom door
her hand knocks
you okay in there
colter sits on the closed toilet seat
head buried in his hands
desperate for it all to end
christinas holding colters messenger bag
she talks through the closed door
you left your bag on the seat
which is a flagrant violation of rail security leaving a suspicious package behind and all that
i probably saved you a huge fine
ill just leave it right out here for you
she places the bag beside the door
she hesitates at the door
the oddness of this situation
colter stares into the mirror at the strangers face
practically catatonic at this point
and then her voice if itll help you remember youve been riding this train every morning for three months
her words rouse him
christinas walking back down the aisle
the car rocks to one side as an express train flashes by on the opposite tracks going the other way
a blur and a whoosh and its gone
on the verge of opening the door colter hears a metallic rattling
two screws are rattling around in the sink
colter picks up a screw
turns it over and over in his hand
what are they doing in the sink
he looks up
an overhead ventilation panel has been pried open
above it is the darkness of a crawl space
something is sitting up there
from outside comes a train horn
through the windows a freight train is passing the other way
a moving wall of metal boxcars and liquid tankers
colter looks up into the crawl space
cant quite see the object up there
moving carefully in the tiny space he stands up on the toilet
grabbing onto the ventilation panel he wrenches it all the way open
then pulls himself uncomfortably upward
on tip toes he looks into crawl space and discovers its an enormous device
several large cannisters tied together full of sloshing liquid
barely discernible behind wires and gaffing tape is cell phone the bombs detonator
running footsteps from outside
an alarm sounds
fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain reaction
the fire is spectacularly bright lighting up the windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks
nearby trees incinerate mere matchsticks amid sheets of flames
on the rowhouses a aluminum door moldings begin to melt in the intense heat
one of the freight cars loaded down with coal shuddering from the blast wobbles a few yards then pitches over rolling off the rails tipping right off the elevated tracks
it falls through the air and smashes into the middle of an traffic intersection below with a shattering force
the cascade of explosions continues
large portions of both trains are annihilated while the heat reduces the heavy gauge steel rails back to elemental molten ore
an odd sound like a balloon loosing air or machinery winding down as we brilliant white
all sounds cease
for exactly of a second a mysterious pattern of lines appears
like metal rods maybe
it makes no sense
an abstract pattern
then its gone
many will not even see it
now there is only darkness
the click of an intercom switching on
this is beleaguered castle
were very close on colters upside down face
his eyes flutter open
hes surprised to find himself alive
consternation flashes through him as he discovers that hes tightly strapped in
he now wears a military flight suit
captain colter stevens this is beleaguered castle
the measured calm of a mission controllers voice comes over colters headset
captain stevens do you copy
where am i
youre with beleaguered castle
pull back fractionally to reveal colter in a tight and confined capsule
it bristles with sophisticated electronics and ghostly glowing diodes
hes like an astronaut in an orbiter craft
are you functional
he tries to clear his head
hes still upside down
adjusting your rotation
very slowly almost imperceptibly colters upside down face begins to turn and right itself
can you report at this time
what is this
who am i talking to
no idea how to react
just as on the train
report what you saw
i was on a train
there was a bomb
what the hell is going on
just relax captain
were still in the tiny chamber
as has colter but in the manner of a dangerous wild animal given a sedative
embedded into the controls is a two inch square video monitor
it shows the face of goodwin
hes a middle aged communications officer
although we know him as goodwin his military name badge and rank insignia have been covered up
he wears a headset and sits surrounded by banks of electronic equipment and keyboards
he peers in at colter exuding the blandness of a military flight controller
standby for thread one of alpha memory pattern
who are you
you already have that information captain
recall my name
a long moment
a name floats into his head
how do i know that
i have no idea how i know your names goodwin
commencing memory pattern
listen to me
i was flying a mission
i was in a chopper
then i woke up on a train
now im here
can you explain that
what unit is this
youre with beleaguered castle
youre with friends
the exercises will assist you
are you ready
just like with the train he seems to have no choice but to go along with it
memory thread one
listen to the following passage when lily woke she had the bed to herself
she sat up bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings then memory returned and she looked about her with a shiver
in the cold slant of light reflected from the back wall of a neighboring building she saw her evening dress and opera cloak lying on a tawdry heap on a
end of thread one
is it colters turn to speak
i dont get it
is this a red flag exercise
i am holding the following hand of cards queen of spades
four of clubs
nine of clubs
three of hearts
nine of hearts
i repeat queen of spades
four of clubs
nine of clubs
three of hearts
nine of hearts
end of thread two
beads of sweat on colters forehead
what the hell
the following is a recording of a western screech owl a rather spooky bird call plays a short whistle followed by a long trill
the call is repeated twice more
end of thread three
end of pattern
unexpectedly in the back of his mind a reply is there
end of pattern
how did he know to say that
a conditioned response
stand by to initiate pattern recall
go for pattern recall
the response comes to him more quickly
like lines from an old script
even if it still baffles him
the five playing cards
arrange them in order of descending values irrespective of suit
he thinks for a moment
maybe it will all be okay
queen two nines four and a three
that is correct
the passage i read contained mention of a womans name
what was that name
her name was lily
at each answer goodwin makes notations and adjusts gauges
that is correct
end of pattern
goodwin leans forward to flip a switch and everything goes over darkness the sound of background conversation
engineers speaking in technical jargon
the units video monitor comes on again illuminating colter in its glow
hes still strapped into the capsule
the tiny monitor shows an out of focus view of a lab
like a movie camera inadvertently left on between takes
engineers wander past oblivious
their disjointed conversations continue at low volume
abruptly a man smoking a pipe sits down in front of the camera
his graying hair is windblown and unkempt
his eyes are piercing blue
he wears a track and field warm up jacket
he looks in at us with an unsettling cheshire cat grin
he puffs on his pipe
pressing a button he click shuts the whole thing off again
sound and picture vanish
leaving us suspended
an indeterminate amount of time has passed
goodwin is back on the monitor
please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform youve been trained to operate
colter mulls his options
should he talk
he tugs against the steel harness holding him in
a hatch like the kind used on submarines seals the capsule
goodwins voice grows slightly louder over his headset
please list the primary specifications of the aerial platform youve been trained to operate
is someone going to tell me whats going on here
please list the primary the uh blackhawk helicopter weighs pounds with a maximum exterior load capacity of pounds
it has a range of nautical miles and is armed with two
millimeter machine guns
that is correct
who bombed the train
who bombed the train captain
i have no idea
whom do you suspect bombed the train
i dont know
you didnt see
will you tell me what the hell is going on here
the screech owl song can be seen as a progression of musical notes
did the notes go up down or remain at the same pitch
i dont know
just tell me how many times was the bird call repeated
what does this have to do with the train
how many times was the bird call repeated
who bombed the train captain
i dont know who bombed the train
colter is seething now
had it with these games
you have seventeen minutes
find the bomber
on screen goodwin leans forward to press a button and
everything goes dark
we hear colters nervous hey
the hum of machinery starting up
goddamn it goodwin what is all this
the machinery hum changes modulation
then gives way to a gentle rocking sensation
colter opens his eyes
sunlight hits his face
in flickering patterns
he turns to at the passing woodland scenery
hes back on the train
back in the same navy sports coat
across from him christina is at work on her sketch pad
just like before
other commuters all around him
everything is exactly the same as before
note the remaining story will follow this binary pattern
scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule
compared to tomb like isolation chamber he just came from the train is exploding with sensory input the smell of steaming coffee the cramped proximity of other passengers the crinkle
of an freshly ironed dress shirt the glint of a buckle on a purse the slanting sunlight the trees out the window bursting with summer leaves
almost unintentionally colter finds himself repeating the same opening actions as last time checking his watch a
turning at the scent of passing coffee
peeking in the canvas messenger bag beside him
this time however he takes the books out of the messenger bag
the books are stamped new york public library
he also takes out the apple
takes a bit
no its awesome
crisp and delicious
is goodwin watching him from somewhere
not knowing what else to do he takes a few more bites
enjoying this small pleasure
he reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his close on the ticket
it hasnt been punched yet
the overweight man opens his can of soda
just as before
its a goddamn simulation
christinas pen stops sketching
she glances up
a three dimensional completely immersive scenario
touch taste sound sight and smell
a measure of relief
a way to think about all this
are you talking to me
complete with pretty girl
every combat simulator has one
in the middle of a fire fight a pop up window starts playing a porno
youre an unusual choice for a distraction
and youre a moron
disregarding her colter gets up
pursuing a new line of action
the only way he can make sense of this
he starts walking up the rows
find the bomber
find the bomber
the conductor approaches him
expecting this now colter hands over his ticket to be punched
everything okay today chief
anything out of the ordinary
the conductor frowns at him
who is this guy
please take a seat sir
colter moves on
he looks for suspects
weve seen the faces before the computer engineer the secretary the stock broker the backpacker and so on
all seems normal
he finds himself focusing on a jumble of unfiltered details suits
he grabs a seatback for support
sensory details slam into him
we go extremely close on the stitching on a leather purse
a fountain pen rattling in a fold out tray
air conditioning hissing from a vent
a crumpling sound as the overweight man crushes an empty soda can
tap tap tap the computer engineer tapping his foot on the floor
faster and faster
derek the wall street type talks on his phone trust me by one oclock the bridge is going to be jammed
the click of a lock unlatching
the restroom door swings open
guzman the middle eastern man emerges
after a furtive glance around he quickly takes a seat
now colter makes the connection
the bomb in the restroom
the middle eastern man emerging from the same restroom
colter starts down the long aisle
in his seat guzman slips on dark glasses
he looks forbidding with his mustache and olive colored skin
hows it going
colter stands in front of him arms crossed
behind his dark glasses guzman ignores him but hes visibly uncomfortable
whats your name
guzman is stock still
beads of sweat on his forehead
the conductor appears accosting colter
didnt i tell you to take a seat
where are you
i found him
appealing to goodwins invisible presence
but nothing happens
who are you talking to
an edgy silence
other passengers looking over
colters about to retort about to accuse guzman when he stops
its too easy
colter senses the uproar hes about to create
which just might be a mistake
this guy seemed a little
i was worried about him
i am minding my business
tell him to mind his
the conductor has noticed guzmans white knuckle uneasiness
you feeling all right sir
with a pained smile guzman loosens his collar
motion sickness im afraid
i believe i will get off at the next stop
the conductor turns back to colter
im sitting down
turning away he finds a seat
he studies guzman out of the corner of his eye
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
the train begins to slow down
several rows up he sees christina
she looks back at him with distaste
a small number of passengers get up among them the college student
he catches colters attention as he picks up a wallet from a seat and catches up with derek the stock broker whos about to get off the train
hey you dropped this
relieved takes back the wow
the college student waits to get off
colter now eyes him closely
as the train pulls to a stop guzman forcefully pushes forward towards the doors moving with a barely contained urgency
please let me through
jesus hes running away
the doors slide open
the old man derek and the college kid get off
guzman hurries past them towards the station house
doors are closing
just before the doors close colter steps out onto the platform
eyes locked on guzman who disappears inside the station house
the train pulls off leaving colter behind
did he make the right move
as he goes to pursue guzman colter is struck by more sensory the station clock
its digital numerals flash a
hurting colters eyes with their brightness
the dying hiss of the rails as the train recedes down the track
the super sharp glint of a penny embedded down in the gravel of the tracks
the melancholy sigh of trees in the wind
pushing it all aside he hurries after guzman
entering colter stops
theres no sign of guzman
just an empty marble lobby
a lone clerk restocks timetable brochures at a display
a guy just came through here
did you see where he went
not looking up lots of guys come through here
windows look out over the stations parking lot
theres no sign of guzman out there
he was just here
a middle eastern looking guy
through the platform doors comes derek followed by the college kid
derek heads for the parking lot while the college kid mills around the newspaper stand
a muffled cough
sees a door marked mens room
pushing open the door colter discovers a row of s era sinks and stalls
an intercom crackles to life the train to philadelphia will be four minutes late
the train to philadelphia will be four minutes late
colters footsteps echo down the length of the deserted mens room
the last stall door is shut
from within the closed stall comes the sound of vomiting
colter edges closer
a toilet flushes
guzman emerges from the stall
freezes when he sees colter
all better now
guzmans face hardens
he goes to the sink to wash his hands
dont much care for trains myself
the bathroom mirror of course reflects back sean fentresss face not colters
guzman does not seem to notice this disparity
he picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out
colter takes an uneasy look at fentress looking back at him in the mirror then follows guzman out
colter emerges in the lobby
guzman is nearby
a bit indecisive
colter wanders over to the newspaper stand
the station clock reads a
colter looks down at his watch three minutes remaining
what will guzman do
guzman glances over at colter then heads through the doors and back out on the train platform
guzman sits on a bench
colter stops nearby him
i resent this
this is harassment
you obviously work for someone
i expected this reception in your country
how are you going to pull this off
that bomb has a cell phone detonator
and i dont see a pay phone around here
so im betting you got a phone on you with the number already programmed in
i have no idea what youre talking about
i am an international business man
the tracks begin to vibrate
in the distance comes the horn of an express train approaching
open your briefcase
prove to me theres no phone in there
i will prove nothing to you
leave me alone
colter punches guzman with tremendous force sending guzman sprawling to the ground
colters hand throbs from the force of the punch
the simulations reality stuns colter all over again
crouching down colter pops open guzmans briefcase
inside is a corporate identification badge with guzmans name and photograph on it
the company is shell oil
hasnan guzman vice president shell oil
must be a cover
philadelphia train now approaching
guzman groans in pain
colter rifles through his briefcase
where the hells your phone
another look at his watch seconds
grabbing guzman colter goes through his suit pockets
he triumphantly pulls out guzmans cell phone and steps back
guzman looks up at him eyes moist with humiliation and malice
i thought so
now lets see you try to a distant thud rattles the station windows
colter pivots looks down the tracks
the first thing he sees is closing in on the station
the second thing he sees far beyond it miles further down the tracks is the rising plume of a huge explosion
colter looks back at guzman in shock
then down at guzmans cell phone
which has remained off
you didnt do it
as the din of the distant explosion is drowned out by the roar of with a cry of rage guzman springs up and pushes colter into the path of the
on coming express train with a blast of its horn the train runs him over
like film celluloid catching fire in a projector the world itself blisters and burns into searing white
into smothering forgetful silence
for exactly of a second of a second longer than before the same flickering after image appears this time they all connect into the sound of machinery straining
colter is slammed back into his seat back in the capsule
all he can do is hang on and gasp for air
lower your pulse
colter opens his eyes
hes back in his military flight suit
the craft goes still
cautiously he releases his hands from their grip on the seat restraints
he looks like hes sweated off five pounds
do you need to urinate
a fucking train just ran over me
do you need to urinate
how are you doing this
am i on some kind of drug
did you find the bomber
i didnt find the bomber
you fooled me with the middle eastern guy
i went for the diversion
what kind of freaky simulation is this
let me out of here
which middle eastern guy
look i dont have intel experience
why do you have me doing this
youve already been told what you need to know
discipline your memory
limit your operational awareness to the tasks we assign you
everything else is irrelevant
killing me each time is irrelevant
you do not die
as you can see you simply return to us
how can you do that
whos the man with the pipe
there was a man smoking a pipe
i saw him on the monitor
how does he fit into this
the man with the pipe isnt here right now
let me talk to him
this isnt right
im not your prisoner
goodwin makes technical adjustments to dials and gauges
you feel unsatisfied with our relationship
what is this
why are you talking like that
is this some kind of script
if guzman the middle eastern man is innocent as you maintain who might be the guilty party
im tired of this
this isnt a game captain
then what is it
dont you already know who the bomber is
dont you have all the answers
we have no answers
a weird beat
some were too badly burned to be identified
the heat from the explosion fused many of them completely into the wreckage
is this the truth
or another evasive answer
his mind pulled in all kinds of unpleasant directions
these were real people
this really happened
the train blew up today
it was attacked this morning at a
eastern standard time
six miles outside of new york city
colters head is spinning
i dont believe it
what do your senses tell you
his senses tell him its true
but how can he accept it
where am i right now as we speak
with beleaguered castle
my units still in iraq
im flying missions in iraq
i flew one yesterday
your unit was rotated stateside three weeks ago
the news comes like a slap in the face
colter clearly has no memory of this
then why do i still have iraqi dirt underneath my fingernails
goodwin simply makes another adjustment on the controls
talk to me
ive been back three weeks
howd i get in here
have i seen my family
does my father know im home
cause id kinda like to tell him if thats the case
listen up soldier
goodwin hunches forward putting his elbows on his desk
as he does so he inadvertently reveals a glimpse of his military unit shoulder patch
the insignia contains wings and a lightning bolt against a background of stars
underneath it is written caoc n
the train is just the beginning
our intel says there are more attacks are coming today
and theyre linked with the train
time is of the essence
do you understand
colter barely hears
hes fixated on that shoulder patch
counterterrorism has come up with the five most likely follow up targets in the new york area
they are in no order of importance the holland tunnel newark international airport the brooklyn bridge penn station and the empire state building
it could be any of them it could be none of them
whatever it is if you find the bomber and learn his plan the next one we might be in a position to prevent
those are your orders
its too much information to process
colters head spins with questions
if im somehow on that train before it blows up why dont i just dismantle the bomb
those are not your orders
but all those people dying
those are not your orders
you are not to influence events any more than you need to in order to accomplish your mission
i didnt volunteer for this shit
would you like to see the release form you signed
how do i know its real
how do i know you didnt force me to sign it
and how the hell can i be put on a train over and over again a train i never was really on
he might as well be talking to a wall
i dont believe in time travel goodwin
theres no such thing
machinery begins to run
like the whine of a jet engine firing up
only one way forward captain
find the truth
the capsule begins to shake
let me out
dont send me back there
sfx up on a huge roar as the train hurls down the tracks
landscape flies by
colters forehead rests against the glass window
this is not happening
he leans back in his seat as if just another beaten down office worker on the train
aint life grand
across from him christina sketching
a gentle smirk
he focuses in on her
not knowing where else to begin
you an artist
i went to art school
doesnt make me an artist
can i see what youre working on
her pencil pauses
she eyes colter
id rather not
he looks down at his watch
hes been back for one minute
adjusting the settings he changes the digital display to count down the remaining sixteen minutes
he tries again for human contact
you dont look like you belong here
the way youre dressed
you certainly do
id really like to see what youre working on
unless youre worried i wont like it
and your opinion doesnt interest me
so you scribble away on that thing so as not to deal with people
tosses the sketch pad onto his lap
surprised colter opens it
its full of faces thumbnail portraits of other passengers riding the train
theyre exquisitely observed darkly stylized into expressions of loneliness
i wouldnt go that far
seriously theyre really good miss
my names colter
how many of these passengers have you drawn
all of them practically
she leans forward eyes glinting conspiratorially
i know all about them
you know all about them
im a collector of moments
that woman over there
shes a patent attorney with three kids and a summer place on long island
more important however she colors her hair herself and wears the same houndstooth check suit every third wednesday
the nebbishy fellow behind her always calls into his office three minutes before we go into the tunnel
and the guy with the shaved head and leather jacket eating a scone has a profile identical to that of julius caesar
a click of the restroom door opening
guzman emerges from the bathroom and returns to his seat
what about that guy
christina looks over guzman
i havent seen him before today
thinks the worst of people
you see anything unusual happen this morning
anything out of the ordinary
im not sure i know what you mean
has anyone else come out of that bathroom that you remember
she takes a closer look at him
a puzzled smile
who are you
dont you know
havent you seen me here every day for what three months
somethings different about you today
if i told you that theres a terrorist on this train that i was sent here to catch him would you believe me
then tell me which one youd arrest
christina pages through her sketch pad again
considering different faces
theyre all so utterly normal
thats whats terrifying about them
perhaps theres more than one
a team at work
the patent attorney in cahoots with julius caesar and the nebbishy guy
and dont forget the sullen college kid
hes the expendable one
but theyre all controlled by this good looking stock broker
she shows him her sketch of derek the stock broker
blond blue eyed hyper alert
the perfect machiavellian operative
out for himself
hell betray them all in the end
shes not taking him seriously
he gets up
foolish of him to confide in her
his watch now reads thirteen minutes
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
the train begins to slow
derek guzman the old man and the college kid head towards the exit doors
hes getting away
colter moves aside to let them walk past
thanks for your help maam
how old do you think i am
i dont know
her icy glare tells him hes guessed too high
the disembarking passengers exit the platform
the train is moving again
in the exit area colter watches the station disappear
hes doing this all wrong
next stop new york penn station
the two screws rattle in the sink
colter gazes up at the half opened ventilation shaft and at the edge of the sinister bomb planted there
back down to the mirror
sean fentresss face
the most baffling mystery of all
what happened fentress
who are you
how can i be you
flashcut back in the isolation unit
on the monitor the glimpse of goodwins shoulder patch insignia
the unit initials caoc n
back to scene
colter churning over the thought
what unit is that
a knock on the door
through the windows comes the blur of the express train whizzing past the same train which previously ran over colter
emerging from the bathroom colter discovers christina there
who were you talking to
leave me alone
colter walks off
irked at his change in tone she follows him carrying his messenger bag
my pleasure okay
its just that you left your bag on your seat
trying to be cute its a flagrant violation of rail security leaving a suspicious package behind and all that
maybe youre the terrorist
this is too much
colter turns on her
why did you say that
i was joking
who are you
are you an operative
i had no idea you were so thoroughly weird
im not entirely sure i like it
why do you have sketches of everybody on board
are you part of this
part of what
i can have you arrested
maybe thats the only way youll drop the bullshit and talk
im getting help
she sees hes serious and drops her arch playfulness
speaks in a flat sober voice
who am i
ill tell you
im twenty seven years old
i have no savings and no health insurance
he turns back
the more she speaks the angrier she gets
six months ago i moved back in with my parents because i ran out of money
i got as in line drawing and advanced oil painting but no ones buying my stuff
two weeks ago i put away all my paints
my little sketch book is the last thing left
you see im not a artist
im a receptionist in a law firm
the only thing i operate is a phone switchboard
the stark reality of her life
the horn of the freight train yanks his attention to the windows
up ahead are the row houses opposite which the train exploded
time is running down
now let me tell you about you
you work at the new york public library
youve been eyeing me for months on this train but havent said a word to me
youre bland and colorless and predictable
and now i see youre delusional too
colter doesnt hear her
hes still looking out the window
above the row houses a commercial airliner is climbing serenely into the blue after take off out of newark airport
the view is wiped away as the freight train comes surging past the windows
but the sight of the plane has already caused something to click in colters head
son of a bitch
thats not army
thats air force
combined air and space operations center
nellis air force base
are you mocking me
theyre running this whole thing out of nellis air force base in nevada
tears in christinas eyes
that colter would persist in this delusion after what shes confessed about herself
racking his brain whats there
whats on that base
air combat command
something to this this a remote operation
what if it is time travel
a worried conductor runs past them talking rapidly into his radio
we catch the words bomb threat
what did he say
a warning alarm begins beeping
passengers look around uneasily
christina however focuses her anger on colter
do me a favor
dont ever talk to me again
she drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away
colter looks down at his watch
the last seconds tick away
he grabs her she struggles against him get off me
but he holds her tight shielding her with his body and squeezing his eyes shut as blinding light
painful to look at
like a star exploding
a dull hollow sound of wind rattling through an abyss
and then the ghostly still life
details flicker into view a bicycle
a stone wall
and next to it
turning to look at us
a gentle reassuring smile
the video monitor is malfunctioning
it flickers on and off revealing colters face in and out of darkness
the capsule is nearly shut down
the controls appear non functional
ice crystals have formed over the circuitry
colter hugs himself shivering
his breath is visible in the capsules tomb like cold
can you read me
its goddamn cold in here
he hits a few buttons
almost at random
the vents which had been blowing in air fall silent
goodwin im losing oxygen
the monitor fizzles out
the light from the controls fades
its now completely dark
he bangs on the side of the capsule
just a muffled thump
a terrifying silence
the snap of a harness releasing
a thud as colter falls to the floor of the capsule
some sounds of thrashing around
the spark of a blue flare illuminates colters face
hes activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit
it begins to blink
like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in the sea
it is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule
up on his knees he grasps the release handles of the exit hatch
using all his strength he turns
but the handles dont budge
the hatch remains sealed
he gets to his feet
cant stand up fully
the capsule is incredibly cramped
rifling through a cabinet he discovers operational manuals in small almost illegible type
and a small set of tools
he spreads them out on the tiny ledge
taking a wrench he bangs on the escape hatch
a deep clanging echo in the hull
so like any pilot would he sets about repairing his craft
at first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry
daunted by the complexity
theres no time to lose
using a miniature screw driver he begins unscrewing the monitor panel
his fingers are slow and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out of his hands
icicles have appeared over dormant air vents
colter ice crystals in his hair is shivering more violently
much of the capsules electronics lay open and exposed
using copper wires hes attempting to revive a row of batteries
they spark once
it shocks him
theres a puff of blue smoke
hes burned his fingers
but the battery now has a tiny blinking green light
working fast colter attaches the copper wires to the leads on the battery
from inside the engines comes a faint electric hum
the monitor awakens
like a film projector it throws the image of a playing card onto the opposite side of the craft
colter begins replacing the monitor components
as he does a pre recorded audio file comes on four principle dialects of arabic egyptian gulf syrian lebanese and north african
we will now play you portions of each discussing the audible differences between them
clips of spoken arabic begin to play
colter continues reconstituting the computer
the monitor fills with scrolling lines of computer code
with an oddly low tech clang the heart of the machine reawakens
the air vents come back to life
heat starts to return
the icicles begin to drip
colter sits back in his seat exhausted from the work
the monitor switches to a real time view of the lab
goodwins chair is there but goodwin is not in sight
in a background distorted by the fish eye lens various technicians wander by
anyone out there
he toggles an audio jack
then a man comes walking up
frowns into the camera as if through the foggy lens of another world
its the man with the pipe
the elusive bohemian scientist whom colter glimpsed once before
he will be known as can you hear me
rutledge is tinkering with the camera
the image shakes for a moment as he adjusts it
then puts on a headset
project designer initiating sequence and drives check
rutledge checks his headset
not sure he heard right
is someone there
rutledge blinks in surprise
the blue eyes sparkling
the capsule lost power
its still pretty cold in here
weve been working towards you from the other side
nice to have you with us again
you feeling all right
i think so
who are you
the names rutledge
they wouldnt let me talk to you before
no i guess not
theyre pretty anal around here
lights his pipe dont tell them you saw me smoking in here okay
his genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the military environment
and then it occurs to colter youre the inventor of this thing
i prefer the term project designer
and sorry for all the secrecy
goodwin will be thrilled you re established contact
i dont want to deal with goodwin anymore
dont you understand
hes torturing me
cant you get me out of here
rutledge looks uneasy
as a scientist hes ill equipped to deal with personnel issues
why would goodwin have it in for you
hes a remote operator
and remote operators are risk averse pussies who sit at control screens in the rear while actual pilots like me put their asses on the line in the field
he seems pretty devoted to the mission
and just what kind of mission is this
talk to me man
why wont he let me save those people on the train
because they cant be saved
i know whats going to happen
i could take apart the bomb
stop the train
yeah but youd be doing it in the source code not here
not in our own past
mystery upon mystery
whats the difference
im not sure i should be telling you this
telling me what
coaxing the scientist in him
its quantum physics
it would take weeks to explain
is source code time travel
looks at his pipe
its gone out again
why cant i save those people on the train
think of it like this events in our past can never be undone
einstein proved that
so source code opens up another past for you
a parallel past
it looks the same but it has no intersection with our own world
in essence by sending you back an entirely new but utterly parallel world is created
it looks identical to ours but nothing you do there has any effect on this reality
at last some useful information
colter races to process it
what happens to the source code world after i leave it
i dont know
you can never know that because youre not there to observe it
maybe it vanishes
i should tell them youre okay
what about the bicycle
i see it each time
right after the bomb goes off
like an after image
theres a bicycle and a stone wall and a girl
its a girl from the train
i dont know where any of it is supposed to be but rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth
you see all this after you leave the train
just for a split second
rutledge is stunned
like hes discovered some strange new property to his invention
please tell me youre not making this up
what do you think it means
i dont know
rutledge looks off camera for a moment
theres no more time to talk
make sure he sends you back in
find out about the after images
rutledge reluctantly takes off his headset
dont leave me
rutledge steps away
a pointed look at colter
goodwin settles back into his seat donning the headset
how are you feeling
no thanks to you
you find the bomber
youre a brick wall goodwin
a fucking brick wall
lower your pulse
the situation has worsened
the fire on the tracks caused one of the freight cars to blow up and release some kind of gas
as a precaution theyre having to evacuate all of lower manhattan
evacuate lower manhattan
the enormity of this
having to take it on faith
we may have lost the initiative
what do you mean
lets keep going
we were expecting more from you
i can give you more
let me think for a second
but goodwin ignores him
absorbed in paperwork
the freight car blows up from the fire
it spews gas or what could be gas it might be chlorine so they cant take any chances
trying to make up lost ground
whatever it takes to get sent back in
so they decide to play it safe and evacuate parts of new york city
and maybe thats part of the terrorists plan right
so who benefits from that
whats down there in lower manhattan
surprising himself with this insight
and now goodwin is paying attention again
waiting for more
thats what theyre going to hit next
the financial markets
goodwin considers this
for the first time slightly impressed
i want to show you something
the video monitor shows christinas dmv shot
her wry secretive smile
did she die too
this drivers license photo was found with her body
were creating a database of recovered identifications as they come in from the site
a pang of sorrow
moving among ghosts
you sure shes dead
would you like to see her morgue photos
she was sitting across from me
playing a grainy hand held video of the train wreckage
rescue workers in protective gear picking their way carefully through the twisted charred remains of the two trains
this was taken shortly after the rescue crews arrived on scene
the time code on the image reads a
we noted the location of each corpse when we pulled it out
on screen rescue workers pull a charred corpse out of the wreckage
this is unedited footage
i told you i didnt want to see her
the camera zooms in on a corpse
its burned face like a piece of rotted fruit fills the screen
nevertheless we recognize it
and its not christina
its someone else
the man in the mirror
himself at least on the train
he died on the train
as a host identity sean fentress had to have certain basic similarities to you
his head was still intact
we need the head you see
to link the two of you remotely
they carry the corpse towards a morgue truck with a vast array of satellite communication equipment attached to it
the image freezes then dissolves back to christinas dmv photo
would you like to see the other passenger photos
perhaps that would help you
you still have christinas body
the other things she was carrying
i want to know about her
everything i can
shes not just another victim
shes connected to all this
the rich smell of steaming coffee
the glint of a polished leather shoe
the crisp click of someone uncapping a fountain pen
the scenery rushing by the blur of trees the soft lavender of the morning sky
the swell and pull of the mighty machine coursing over the rails
if a train ride could ever be a sensory delight this is it
to colter every sensation has become even more pronounced more intensely real than ever
close on his watch a beep as he sets it to countdown again from seventeen minutes
the duration of his freedom
across from him is christina
absorbed with her sketching
thirty six dollars and eleven cents
she looks up at him
in your wallet
thirty six dollars and eleven cents
is this a magic trick or something
in five seconds a guys going to open a can of soda
the overweight man opens his soda can
she gives colter a quizzical look
he points out the window
theyre passing a neighborhood of modest homes
were about to pass a street with willow trees
two girls will be jumping rope
a white dogs going to run out behind them
a dalmatian mix
in a moment they pass a scene exactly as colter described
christinas befuddled smile
you want to tell me how youre doing this
you could say im a collector of moments
a collector of moments
thats the cheesiest line ive ever heard
she resumes her drawing
you trained to be an artist
you got as in line drawing and oil painting
but your work didnt sell
you took a job answering phones in a law firm
six months ago you moved back in with your parents
two weeks ago you put your paints away for good
the sketch book is all you have left
who the hell are you
who have you been talking to
i havent ever talked to you
but we have christina
youve drawn all these people here
you know their routines
at one point you thought you were different from all of them
but now youre not so sure
christina has gone white
a small bar area
coffee sloshing in styrofoam cups colter hands one to christina and sits down opposite her
a glance at his watch shows twelve minutes left
okay youve got my attention
now tell me what this is all about
i need your help
are you selling something
listen to me
i cant use up any more time trying to convince you
i just need you to believe everything im about to tell you
this better be good
bear with me
beat where to begin
your sketch book
is there a drawing of me in there
im not sure
she flips through it
shows him a sketch of sean fentress
i did it last week
the thing is thats not me
give me a little credit
you drew what you saw but the person youre seeing now is someone else
im not sean fentress
im not really on this train
youre not really on this train
im taking someones place
my name is colter
im a soldier
and im being held prisoner
and this is the only way the only time and place i have to figure out how to escape
she gives him a blank look
after three months of riding the train this is how you introduce yourself to me
elements in the american military are using me for an experiment
im not sure exactly how it all happened but im at a facility on nellis air force base in nevada
as we speak
its a project called source code
its a program
it shifts identities
it also performs small amounts of time travel
or time engineering
i dont know the jargon
hes not getting through to her
its too bizarre
ive been put on this train to look for someone
and i need to find out just enough about him to keep them putting me back on this train
because right heres only place i can figure out whats really happening
but i have very little time
and each time i come back you wont remember me and ill have to go through this all over again
you are i think deliciously mad
then how do i know all those things about you if weve never spoken before
she doesnt have an answer
cant easily dismiss him
why tell all this to me
theres lots of people around for you to talk to
because i think you have the answer to this whole thing
believe me i dont have the answer for anything
theres a vision
i keep having it
its very powerful
and youre in it
and theres a bicycle
old stone wall
and its very peaceful
does this sound familiar
like where you live maybe
my parents live in a house with aluminum siding and an american eagle over the door
the only bike is a harley which the guy down the street revs at three in the morning
the vision must mean something
its the only time when im not on the train or in the capsule
why else would rutledge be so interested
someone who was trying to help me understand something
until they got to him
he lowers his head
a dead end
the train begins to slow down
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
colter looks at his watch
ten minutes left
i saw a program on tv
it was about psychics
they say psychics have a lot of paranoia
i dont believe in that shit
through the window the old man derek and the college kid disembark
guzman hurries past them to the station house
doors are closing
dont you have people you can go to for help
the train begins to move again
this is a new york bound train
next stop new york penn station
most of my friends are in the military
my dad runs a melon farm in alabama
maybe nows the time to reach out to him
she hands him her cell phone
colter just holds it in his hand
me and my dad we dont see eye to eye
were just two different people
as opposed to being the exact same person
are you always this sarcastic
this is so not about me
colter reluctantly dials
as it rings what day is it
one more thing to puzzle him
the call connects
an older man donald stevens answers
the gravelly voice of a midwestern farmer
donald doesnt respond
dad its me
been a while huh
id been meaning to call you but click
the line goes dead
colter looks at christina
he wanted me to stay on and take over the farm but
i had other ideas
youre intimidated by him
youre scared of him
i can see it
the hell i am
challenged he redials
braced for conflict
the call connects
dad dont hang up
were going to talk
i need your help
now you listen to me
whoever you are never call here again
donald hangs up
hes still mad at you huh
it was like he didnt even know who i was
troubled he hands back her phone
outside the express train flashes by
i dont know how to help you
she feels bad for him
and something inside colter closes
retreating inside himself
sorry to have bothered you
he gets up to go
christina stays where she is
back in his seat
lost in the view out the window
the neighborhoods have given way to newarks industrial fringe
bringing him closer to the inevitable end
i have a friend
surprised he turns to find her there
she works at the new york times
her names stephanie
shes just a proofreader but she wants to be made a reporter
shes always saying she needs a good story to bring in so she gets noticed
something like this with a crazy paranoid angle could really interest her
she could do some poking around
shes already quite suspicious of the government
christinas dialing her phone
colter turns back to the window
im getting voice mail
into the phone steph its christina
you know that story youre always looking to write
i might just have something for you
i met a guy
his name is colter stevens
he says hes in the army
he flies helicopters in iraq but now theyve put him into a secret project called source code
maybe you can look into it a bit okay
she hangs up
pleased with herself
shell call back
none of it will do colter any good but he manages a smile
thank you maam
how old do you think i am
he gives her a wary look
she smiles pleased
no but thanks
what did you mean theres a criminal on the train
how do you know that
colter looks away
i just do
how can i help you if you dont tell me everything about this
colter enters the tiny space
christina is reluctant to follow him into the bathroom
you said you wanted to know
cant you just tell me
he gives her an imploring look
she sighs and squeezes in next to him
try anything and ill kill you
shut the door
as she shuts the door colter gets up on the sink
what are you doing
he wrenches back the ventilation panel then steps aside
its up here
he holds out his hand
she grabs hold and steps up on the sink
shes not quite tall enough to see into the crawlspace so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest of the way
startled feels his hands what are you just look
her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up
a long beat as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb
its a liquid explosive
theres fourteen cannisters of it
cell phone signal closes the circuit and boom
he lowers her
an incredulous beat
did you put this here
it was someone else
they dont know who
thats why im here
to find out
will she believe him
we have to tell someone
we have to stop this
the bathroom door opens and christina walks quickly away
colter falls into step behind her
it wont matter
the trains already
ive been sent here
it sounds crazy but its true
ive been sent from the future from five hours in the future
this trains already been blown up
she backs up
scared of him
every right to be
you wanted to know
now you know
she turns and hurries for the exit doors
this isnt happening
ive got to get off
colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule
shes stabbing at the door release button
why wont it open
her phone is rings
they both stop
she looks at the number
i told you shed be interested
her eyes are fixed suspiciously on colter as she listens
colter looks outside
recognizes the terrain
looks down at its awful
he dashes towards the bathroom tears open the door
jumps up on the sink
sits in the semi darkness faintly illuminated by the bathrooms fluorescent light
as he grabs hold of the bomb he hears colter
working fast he unhooks the leads on the detonator rips away gaffing tape jostling the cannisters of explosives colter i have to tell you something
and pulls off the detonator cell phone
ducking back down he see christina standing in the doorway
now the fucking thing cant go off
stephanie did a computer search
something in her expression worries him
shes got a database of all newspaper articles going back to forever
source codes classified
it wouldnt be in a newspaper
but you were
she found you
she found me
what does that mean
not wanting to go on
from outside comes the horn from the approaching freight train
jesus christ christina are you going to spit it out
in his hand the cell phone rings
colters eyes light up in amazement the display screen is showing the name and number of the bomber
but before he can read whats there christinas voice finds its way to the back of his brain according to the notice you were killed in action two months ago
the world stops
a searing pain slams into him
he drops the phone and doubles over
she runs to him
everything around him pixelates into a hundred thousand points on an array
christinas cries become bursts of static
flying behind the array come lines of computer code the source code architecture laid bare
and then the screen itself seems to melt giving way to a frightening series of hallucinatory fragments a pilots p
desert sand searingly bright flight deck instrumentation a windshield pockmarked with bullet holes the horizon tilting as the helicopter plunges towards earth amid a chaos of radio transmissions
taking a lot of rpg fire
be advised a is going down
a is going down hard
boots crunching on sand as we are borne p
a victim on a jostling stretcher
the thud of rotors
through blurred vision we see medics working furiously to save a life
the smooth glassy calm of feet
the regular pulsations of a ventilator
fluids drip down through an iv bag
tubes and monitors stacked all around us
gurneys of other wounded packed together
the grumble of another unseen wounded soldier never any damn leg room on a plane
an alarm begins beeping
hey this guys crashing
silence and darkness
then a playing card appears as if through a slide projector
the jack of clubs
the playing card flickers separates into pixels then dissolves
captain allow me to introduce myself
my name is goodwin
youre with beleaguered castle
you are safe
all your needs will be met here
lines of computer code flit across the screen
a blinking cursor
a tiny aperture opens
and the bicycle
and the stone wall
the strange recurring vision
the sound drives away the image replacing it with captain just tell me what you see
just look and speak
a ragged voice i see a card
very very good
on colters face
a deep cold knot in his stomach
shuddering in fear
the truth before him now
crouching there a nightmare ruling over him
on the monitor goodwin looks into the camera
assessing the situation
are you comfortable
are you warm
colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing entirely from existence
do you need to urinate
too terrorized to speak
beleaguered castle is waiting for your report
goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard
he flips a switch
a blocky computer voice something out of the s comes on hearing test
a short series of electronic tones
the tones cease
colter remains impassive and inert
captain i know you can hear me
did you find the bomber
goodwin keys in some commands
memory thread one when lily woke she had the bed to herself
she sat up bewildered by the strangeness of her surroundings then memory returned and she looked about her with a shiver
goodwin stops the audio
as youre collecting your thoughts i should tell you theres been another development
a terrorist group has taken responsibility for bombing the train
this began broadcasting over the internet a half hour
weve traced it to central asia
a grainy video shows an arid wind swept plateau of a far away desert
it is twilight
a mujahideen fighter his face hidden by a hooded cloak sits cross legged before a flickering camp fire and a tea service
the fighter rises picks up a rocket propelled grenade launcher and approaches the camera
the wind whips his black robes
the figure looks slight
it begins speaking to the camera
on camera in accented by now you have suffered a taste of divine vengeance
god willing you will soon suffer another
colter does not raise his head
no idea whether hes even listening
these attacks will show you that you will never be safe
you can secure your borders
but what can you do against one of your own citizens
one who looks like you who is blameless living already among you who takes eighty million of our dollars a trifle and carries out our bidding
you cannot stop this
time has run out
the image freezes
then switches back to the live feed of goodwin
let me talk to rutledge
so youve decided to speak
we appreciate your desire for further discussion
perhaps at a later date
will you let me out of here
goodwin ignore the question
continues making notations
frankly captain were disappointed
i have to say that we expected more from you
stop reading from your goddamn script
perhaps we overestimated your abilities
i swear to fucking christ
please accept the criticism in the spirit it was given
perhaps a few memory exercises would help
i dont need your criticism and i dont need your memory exercises you gutless freak
and by the way that bomb is detonated by a cell phone
when activated the phones display screen displays caller id information
i wonder if that information would be useful to beleaguered castle
for a split second goodwin looks thrown
but the mask of the cold clinician goes back up
were ready for that information
youll have to send me back
i didnt get a good look at it
but i will next time
what assurance do we have youll be able to read the screen before the device detonates
goodwin theres no time left
goodwins pale inscrutable face fills the monitor
his eyes are unblinking
nothing behind them
colter prowls the aisle feverishly
he scans the overhead luggage rack
peeks inside a bag
doesnt see what he wants
he looks all around
up the rows of passengers
the computer engineer
but clutched in his hand is what colter wants a cell phone
the train jolts slightly waking him up
looking down the computer engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished
across the aisle a latina office manager taps him on the arm
she gestures down the aisle to whos walking off with the guys cell phone
behind him the computer engineer gets up
hey do you have my phone
people turn to look
among them is christina
colter just starts walking faster
dude give me back my phone
the computer engineer hurries in
colter is nowhere in sight
he runs down the aisle and towards the next car
pan over to the door of the conductors compartment as it breathless colter has just finished shutting the door and is about to use the cell phone when sees the
conductor and a train official looking over at him in surprise
reversing gears colter backs out of the compartment
just as the befuddled computer engineer disappears into the third car colter steps back into the aisle and walks the other way
sweating a bit now colter is keying in a number on the cell phone as he walks
city and listing
las vegas nevada
nellis air force base
a tingle up his spine
the call connects
nellis air force base
how may i direct your call
he takes a deep breath
im trying to reach
captain colter stevens
no idea where this is going
i have no listing for a captain colter stevens
then give me the combined air and space ops center
one moment sir
the call seems to take forever to connect
then a terse military voice comes on the phone
who is this
im calling for rutledge
you have the wrong number
this is captain colter stevens
an eerie pause
would you repeat that
captain colter stevens
hold the line
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
the train slows at it pulls into newark station
another voice comes over the phone
this is goodwin
colters heart sinks
where are you captain
let me talk to rutledge
where are you
how did you find us
im on the train
the train pulls to a stop
you dont know
it hasnt happened yet
what hasnt happened
doors are closing
dont you understand
im in it goodwin
im calling you from inside the mission
inside the source code
a beat of stunned silence
the train begins moving
next stop new york penn station
this contact is ill advised
i must ask you to hang up
goodwin im trapped in this and i cant get out
you have no authorization to be making this call
dont hang up
theres no time
soon youre going to find out what happened on this train
and then your own day is going to start
but not until then
right now its just you and me talking
and youre a different goodwin than the one im going to go back to in a few minutes
youre separate from him
do you understand
i think so
now theres a lot of secrecy in all of this and you have your reasons for that
but here and now just this once i need to ask you something
and you need to tell me the truth
id rather you not ask me anything captain
im going to ask it
i should terminate this call
jesus goodwin how can i get through to you
youre not just a soldier
somewhere inside youre a human being too
somewhere inside youve got to know that this is wrong
source code is wrong
and if you cant grasp that if you just follow orders then youre just as much a prisoner as i am
the car shudders as the express train flashes by
quiet returns as it recedes
whats your question
surprised colter raises his head
draws a breath
did i survive that helicopter crash in iraq
colter shuts his eyes
did i survive that crash
this is crushing colter
you did not physically survive the crash
a terrible chill comes over colter
trying to stay brave
at least give me an answer i can understand
weve kept alive certain areas of your brain
the capsule im in
your way of making sense of it
this is crushing
colter fights back terror
you had no right
as a soldier
i was a soldier
it was the only way
you couldnt have a body and be sent back into the source code
what is the status of your mission
is it a success
you really want to know
i suppose not
youre right to keep it from me
thats what we do
keep stuff from each other
will this ever end
how can i get out of this
you must realizes the armys made an investment in you
youll be used again
imagine a turntable
with a record spinning on it
all we do is lift up the needle
the music stops
and then what
then we wait
until another mission
and the needle comes down again
you wont remember any of this
well start with the playing cards
simple memory exercises
bit by bit well revive your cerebral capacities once more
the barbarism of it
how many times have i done this
does it matter
no one knows im here
no one can help me
in stimulating your cortex theyre prolonging your life
many soldiers would find that preferable to death
you cant do this
i served my country
i already gave my life
the courts know youre here
military court or civilian court
colter finds no comfort in this
im sorry you found out about all of this
that wasnt our intention
does that make it any less wrong
colter looks down at his watch
time is running out
and theres absolutely nothing he can do
around him is the darkened steel cocoon of the its appearance has altered slightly given colters new awareness of what this really is
the capsule is even more claustrophobic
there are fewer controls
even less light
a shadow world
the monitor is blank
he shouts from the void goodwin
drops into the seat and puts on the headset
fiddles with his pipe as a way to avoid looking at the camera
hows it going
i finally get it rutledge
youre the good guy goodwins the bad guy
working together you get what you want out of me
why didnt i see it before
believe me captain im on your side
i know about the helicopter crash
i know what theyve done with me
look its been a long day
for all of us
but now weve got to bring this home and catch a killer
whats in it for me
these guys are serious
help me out
my ass is on the line too you know
you can do better than that
they sent you here to offer me a deal
if you think im enjoying this youre wrong
whats their offer
what can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me
spit it out you spineless turd
rutledges face goes red
quite possibly no one has ever spoken to him like this before
after a sputtering pause rutledges mouth hardens
the government can decide to take an interest in people
people like your father with his struggling farm
it can discover things like unpaid property taxes
it can call in his equipment loans or tie him down for years in environmental litigation
on the other hand it can pay him handsomely for mineral deposits he never knew were there
as distant and problematic as your relationship was surely youd like the chance to do something for him
a beat of silent outrage from colter
those after images i saw
you never knew about them
they werent part of source code architecture were they
you dont believe that
ive been to places you havent
ive crossed and recrossed that line between living and dying
and when i do that veil gets lifted for just a second
and whats there is real
maybe its a vision of the next world but i can see it
you can see it
but you can never get there without our help
what do you mean
maybe we can get you there
in return for your completing the mission
theyll let you die
ill shut off your life support and youll simply slip away
just like the good lord intended you to do a few months back
a fearful beat
negotiating over his own soul
youd never do it
you wouldnt have to
you could just flip the switch and start me back up again unaware
for all i know youve made this deal with me before
actually we havent
your operational awareness has become too great
if you found out the truth about yourself once you might do so again
as for source code im sure we can find other servicemen coming back from overseas with wounds just like yours
do you have the courage to serve your country one final time
colters eyes bore into rutledge
im going to find you rutledge
retreating from the the display screen on the detonator was a useful and exciting insight you made
this time make it pay off
get the information on the screen
but let the bomb explode
we need the force of the explosion to help integrate you quickly back into the present
the source code machinery is already beginning to hum
rutledge excitedly keying in system commands
you hear me
somehow im going to find you
i doubt that
theres barely time for colter to grab onto the harness restraints before the machinery goes into a deafening howl
colters body convulses and goes limp
unconscious he sags in his seat held in by the harness
everything switches off a split second later the capsule comes back to life again
as if the plug were simply put back in
colter jolts awake
thrashing to get free
hes just completed another source code
the tentacles of the nightmare slowly releasing
replaced by the oppression of being back in the capsule
back in rutledges power
was the bombers identity on the cell phone
i think so
but there wasnt time to read the screen
as soon as it rang the bomb went off
what about the phone itself
make model product identification number
i was unable examine the phone without separating it from the detonator which i was instructed not to do
his delivery is different now
did you make any other progress
what in hecks name did you do for those seventeen minutes
colter does not answer
the machinery again starts up
colter tenses bewildered
eyes dart accusingly to the screen
what are you again he convulses and goes limp
everything powers down
and back up again controls monitor machinery
colter groans and opens his eyes
gripped by another terror
returning from yet another trip on the train
another bomb blast
death and resurrection
rutledge looks in on him with impatience
we can do this all day
until you get it right
i dont feel good
i dont doubt it
whos the bomber
i dont know
i cant keep
the humming again
an insect on a pin
colter tears at his restraints ready to bash his brains out against the controls
and in sudden freedom surges up out of his seat with a cry
around him startled passengers look over in confusion
colter back in his navy jacket slacks and shirt has pitched forward into christina
you want to get off me
the overweight man wide eyed in surprise has his finger poised to open his can of soda
open your fucking soda
the overweight man complies
some half muttered reproaches then most people go back to what they were doing
whats wrong with you anyway
she glares at him at he stands up
he cant respond
despair surges through him
he stumbles off down the aisle
but where can he go
there is no freedom
imprisoned in both worlds
from her seat christina watches him go
sensing the torment in him
colter is slumped in a corner
taps him on the shoulder
he eyes her furtively
like a cave man whos never seen another human being before
youre not okay
hes ghastly pale
hes sweating profusely
return to your seat
the sound of jangling keys
the conductor takes up position in front of him
as implacable as rutledge in his way
hes not feeling well
he still needs a ticket
colter makes no move to respond
no more concern for anything
have it your way pal
he takes out his book to write colter up
ill pay it
i have no idea where he got on
all right all right
getting out her wallet she pays the conductor
he eyes her with disapproval then shambles off
i see customer service is alive and well on new jersey transit
why did you just do that
i dont know
you looked a little lost
the gratitude in his look makes her self conscious
she turns to go
will you do me a favor
get off the train
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
just get off the train
her puzzled look
the train begins to slow down
this isnt my stop
you shouldnt have been on this train christina
you should be living another life
not spending it answering phones for lawyers
how do you
a group of passengers approaches the exit area
weve seen them all before derek the old man the college kid
and the small encounters shuffling around positioning at the doors and the college kid tapping derek on the arm holding out dereks wallet
hey you dropped this
relieved takes it back wow
the train stops
the doors open
derek the old man and the college kid get off
a second later guzman bursts past them making his nauseated run for the station
leaving just colter and christina there
the doors stand open invitingly
everyone has a destiny
and this isnt yours
he steps out onto the platform
holds out his hand for her to join him
a coaxing look
this whole moment
who in the world are you
just do it
stop being afraid
believe in yourself
he waits for her
only two steps away
doors are closing
the spell breaks
those two steps prove to be two much
leave me alone
she retreats back into the car
colter is heartbroken
about to pursue her he happens to look over and see instead of going directly to the station house derek continues walking down the platform alongside the train as if
intending to reboard further down
and then it happens
with a quick motion derek tosses something through an open door of another car then heads quickly away towards the station house
with no time to think colter slips back on board just as the doors slide shut
the train begins moving
christina is nowhere in sight
this is a new york bound train
next stop new york penn station
intrigued colter leaves the exit door area
strides down the aisle of the second car
and reaches the next set of theres nothing there
whatever derek tossed inside is gone
did someone pick it up
colter looks up the aisle and then the other way into the next car
no one there
once more he examines the exit area
gets down on his knees
then he spots it an opening between the floor and one of the wall panels only a few inches high
and there something lies
colter slides it out
intentionally left here
the same wallet the college kid gave back to derek earlier
opening it colter pulls out dereks drivers license
the source code has finished
the monitor shows just the empty chair
finally rutledge returns to his seat
theyve searched the wreckage and found the wallet
it was under the wall panel
just as you said
an awkward dynamic between them
they despise each other but have to work together
believe me hes our guy
he tossed his own wallet back on the train
only reason hed do that
finishing his thought is if he wanted us to think he died in the explosion
we looked into his profile
derek frost is a commodities trader with a wife two children and a promotion one month old
hes an emergency preparedness volunteer on his office floor for gods sake
you saw that terrorist video they said it was one of us
one of our own
if hes really the one you can find out the rest of his plan
by any means necessary
there is no geneva convention in the source code
torture him you mean
find out the plan before it happens here
and then ill let you die
their grisly bargain
in the conductors compartment theres a fully loaded millimeter handgun locked in a safe
think you can remember the combination
christina is absorbed in her sketch book
across from her colter watches
a stranger to her again
it hurts too much
she feels his eyes on her
when she looks up hes gone
as guzman exits the bathroom he almost crashes into colter whos waiting right there
squeezing past guzman does a double take to hear the standard arabic reply
reaching into the overhead crawl space colter once again unhooks the cell phone detonator from the bomb
sitting down on the toilet seat he dials on the cell phone
the new york times
christinas cell phone rings
she gets it out
where are you right now
going to work
the strangest thing
the phone rang at my desk and some guy i dont know said the train youre on isnt safe and that you should get off at the next stop
then he hung up
the train begins to slow down
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
i dont understand
maybe you should get off
are you okay
the station platform slides into view
is there something on the news
some kind of alert
nothing that ive heard
the train pulls to a stop
passengers begin to get off
christina is out of her seat debating
i think you should get off
ill be late for work
the hell with work christina
you hate that job anyway
its probably a joke
a weirdo guy from somewhere
she sees colter down in the exit area
they lock eyes
and somehow she knows
he made the call
colter quickly disappears into the other car
the doors stand open to the platform
just then dereks wallet goes skidding back on board disappearing under the wall panel
a second later colter reaches the exit area
doors are closing
the train doors shut
colter is now out on the platform
christina is not there
concerned walking quickly forward colter looks through the windows
and finds her staring back at him
still on the train
a strange moment between the two of them
once again hes failed to save her
they watch each other for as long as possible until the train pulls away
as the train speeds up christina sits down again lowering her phone
did you get off
ill call you back
she hangs up
as if shes failed some test
but what test
why this weird feeling
this is a new york bound train
next stop new york penn station
the train speeds up
anxiety creeps into her face
looking around the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem ominous hinting that shes made the wrong choice
the conductor enters
about to pour himself a cup of coffee huh
the metal door to the safe has been opened
inside the quiet lobby derek is heading for the outer doors to the parking lot when derek frost
colter is walking towards him holding up dereks wallet
you forget something
is that my wallet
as he goes to take it colter grabs him
behind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of bang the mens room door flies open colter drags derek inside
what the hell man
what the hell
you see this
colter pulls out the detonator cell phone the one he took off the bomb
holds it inches from dereks face
now you cant blow it up
what is this
get away from me
the barrel of a mm pistol
aimed right at him
believe me im very accurate with one of these things
derek raises his hands
like a decent man terrorized
it gives colter pause
does he have the right guy
a toilet flushes
the last stall door opens and guzman emerges
stops cold as colter swings the pistol at him
stay there my man
dont hurt me
stop acting for chrissakes
keep my wallet
take my watch
take anything you want
unprompted guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on the counter
calmer than derek
accustomed to trouble
now you have two wallets
take them and go
this isnt supposed to happen like this
i have a family
what about those other passengers
dont you think they had families
just what is this about
this mans a terrorist
he planted a bomb on the train
colter pulls back the hammer and savagely jams the barrel of the pistol into dereks cheek
whats the next attack
who else are you going to kill today huh
guzman takes a step towards colter
one more step asshole
dont treat him like this
hes not an animal
neither are you
listen to him
for gods sake im not a terrorist
a urine stain spreads on dereks pants
he looks down ashamed
colter keeps the gun on him
piss all you want
you took eighty million dollars to kill hundreds of people today
eighty million dollars
i swear to you
then what about the wallet huh
why the fuck did you twice try to leave your wallet on board
what is it
what is the next attack
so help me ill put this bullet through your brain
i dont know what youre talking about
im going to do it
tightening his finger around the trigger
tears are streaming down dereks face
but hes not going to talk
i would never hurt anyone
i have a family
i guess youll have to kill me
but colter cant
he cant shoot him
he lowers the gun
disgusted with himself
why cant he do it
you are a human being
trying to calm him
even as colter feels like hes failed
this can be worked out
we can listen to each other
the temperature cooling
dereks nodding with him
anything you want
the detonator cell phone rings startling all of them
confused he answers the phone
who is this
are you the guy who was sitting across me on the train
colter looks at his watch
the countdown passes three how can you be calling this number
my friend had it
from when you called her to try and get me off the train
who are you
what do you want
derek and guzman cautiously lower their hands
watching in confusion
i was trying to warn you
im not sure that it matters now
talk to me
i feel that something terribles going to happen
do i need to get off the train
am i going to die
he can hear the b
noise of the train on the other end
im right here okay
dont be afraid
why didnt i get off the train
i knew i should have driven in today
but then theres the bridges right
you never know when theyll be jammed
that stirs something in the back of colters mind
what did you say
you just never know when theyll be jammed
his heart starts racing
on the train
derek in his seat on his cell phone
colter nearby overhearing him trust me by one oclock the bridge is going to be jammed
colter looks to derek
his stomach sinks
by one oclock the bridge is going to be jammed
thats what you said
you knew there was going to be an evacuation
you knew before it happened
all those people walking across the
the realization hits
theyre going to bomb the bridges
while theyre full of people
a slight flicker travels across dereks face
like a disturbance on a surface of deep water
what are you talking about
whos going to over the phone comes the horn from the passing freight train
colter presses the phone to his ear trying to hear her
just hang in there
youll be okay
a hand closes over his gun
before colter can react derek
colter staggers back slumps to his knees
guzman cries out makes a run at derek who spins and spent shell casings roll to a stop on the tile floor
a terrible silence
are you okay
are you there
derek picks up the phone and terminates the call
he coldly evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood
then calmly walks out
as the life slips from colters eyes he manages to focus on his beeping watch where the seventeen minutes have run out
and the world in the haze comes the mystical vision again but deeper in the stone wall now curves over our heads becoming a tunnel
christina walks away from us down into the tunnel
the far end is ablaze in white light
we try calling to her
but our voice is weak and faint
she continues towards the light
and we do not follow
the monitor is dark
everything is still
colter in his seat
for long seconds we watch his face
a jarring transition
we are now away from colters p
and in the real physical environment of the source code operations center
military and civilian personnel work amid mysterious scientific equipment
rutledge talks on a wall phone
like a team player serving his country
we appreciate that
i just hope the information has come in time to clear the bridges
thank you sir
when he hangs up he turns to goodwin and a few other technicians
naked ambition courses through him
whether or not they can stop the bridge attack we came up with the intelligence
and that virtually assures all of our futures
this is just the beginning guys
you did a great job goodwin
you operated our captain with skill and professionalism
whats that you have
goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a citation
the army investigated colters helicopter crash in iraq
apparently he stayed behind to fly protective cover for a disabled convoy until he ran out of fuel
whats this then
some kind of posthumous reprimand for reckless flying
its the silver star
something in goodwins voice momentarily checks rutledges breezy good humor
send it on to his father
itll ease the pain of his sons death
i thought i might inform the captain of the citation
we cant risk acquainting him with the citation in case the memory wipe isnt entirely clean
the memory wipe
i thought we were going to let him die
i know i know
but now the director of national intelligence is sure to want a closer look at our program and until we train up another candidate well need to keep colter around
to demonstrate it
this thing is much bigger than any one of us
goodwin please clear colters memories and re initialize source code
rutledge walks away
the technician gives goodwin a look of disgust
goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the envelope
panels consoles and screens
goodwin takes a seat at his workstation
he swings a microphone up and goes to flip a switch
unsure how to proceed
looks down at the envelope with the citation in it
inside the capsule the silence continues
colter thinks to himself
the monitor then comes on
captain this is beleaguered castle
rutledge walks by himself
pleased with himself
under his breath he acknowledges the praises hes imagining in his head thank you sir
i appreciate your faith in me
its a great day for our country
colter looks out at goodwin
a beat of difficult silence
how are you feeling
are you comfortable
just do it
just do it
i knew they wouldnt let me die
at least you can make me forget all of this
goodwin stares at his hands
what are you waiting for
youre just doing your job
id do the same thing if i was you
at least youve got a shot at saving those people on the bridges
i doubt it
you dont think theyll save them
i meant i doubt youd be doing this if you were me
an unusually personal statement coming from goodwin
look someone had to be where youre sitting and someone had to be in here
turned out it was you and me
just do it
would you like to see christina again
one last time
colters not sure he heard him right
i dont understand
thats all i could give you
no mission to fulfill
the two of you
why would you do that
as a favor
one prisoner to another
you were right
and about source code
weve kept too much from each other
an odd sensation comes over colter
i usually report in at
today i was there early
i was there when the call came in
they share a long look
theres no way
theres no way you could have
goodwin just smiles
the source code was a parallel world
you told me so
its hermetically sealed
nothing i did on that train would have any effect on this reality
you were on the train
i was not
we didnt know if any bleed throughs could occur
the implications would be staggering
thats why you were told to avoid unduly influencing events
youre saying i could have saved those people
not in our world
the time currents are too strong
but minor alterations here and there a phone call say those might slip through
we didnt know for sure
but you proved it
colter is thunderstruck
unable to grasp it
ive been thinking about the things you said on that call
as the day passed the more i understood them
and now i guess weve caught up to each other
just when i think i understand this
theres not much time
they think im re initializing the system
one last look at her
thats all i can give you
theyll nail your ass for this
if i had any feelings id worry about that
but as youve maintained i do not
the strange path of their relationship
ending at last at simple grudging respect
this is beleaguered castle signing off
acknowledge final transmission
final transmission acknowledged
thank you goodwin
goodwin interrupts his preparation for a last look at colter
the noise gets louder
the capsule begins to shake
colter touches the monitor
his fingers imparting to the last image of his world a quiet benediction
sipping a cup of coffee rutledge lingers at a window contemplating his future
blinking out of reverie he goes over to a wall phone and punches an extension
this is rutledge
his face darkens
he slams down the phone and starts running
colter is back on the train
it is morning again seventeen minutes before the destruction
hes back in the navy blazer
the commuters caught up in their individual concerns ignore colter
but he looks on them with an appreciation approaching joy
for a moment he just sits there
simply being alive in this world
attuned to the motion of the train
the sun on his face
and across from him oblivious working away on her sketch pad is christina
the best sight of all
banks of machinery are running
rutledge comes charging in
what is this
who authorized this
we dont know sir
but source code is up and running again
the chair at the console is empty
no idea sir
a digital clock ticks down from minutes
what the hell is he doing
colter drinks in the sight of christina
finally he gets up and walks off down the aisle
as soon as hes gone christina looks up
shes observed his interest in her
doesnt quite know what to make of it
colter is by himself in the exit door area
from his jacket he takes out a cell phone
as he dials
the call connecting
what is the nature of your emergency
rutledge watches the computers churn
shut it down
shut down the source code
the technician hesitates
ill do it myself
rutledge sits down at the controls
i wouldnt do that
rutledge gives a dismissive snort
and yet he pauses
and why not
weve never interrupted source code in mid run
wed have to literally pull the plug
it could damage the processors
let it finish then
no harm in that i guess
all of you are in deep shit i promise you
as for goodwin hell never make it off this base
rutledge picks up a phone
i dont think thats where hes headed
and then catches on
looks up at the technician
grows more and more uneasy
snapping his attention back to which reads
before it hits rutledge is already out of his chair and running for the door
seal the icu
i want a detachment of mps meeting me on the way there
colter walks down the aisle
looks at his watch minutes seconds
the train begins to slow down
now approaching newark station
newark station next stop
the computer engineer begins to wake up
as he does colter passes by deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into the engineers hand without being noticed
derek packs up his things
we see him hide his wallet into a gap in the seat cushions and get up
the college kid also getting up notices dereks wallet picks it up and hurries after him
hey you dropped this
keeping his composure derek accepts the wallet
colter steps aside allowing them to pass
allowing it all to happen
the station slides into view
no one on the platform
rutledge furiously descends shoving people out of his way
rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card through the scanner
it comes up red
he tries again
the door stays locked
the train comes to a halt
unlike before the doors stay shut for several seconds longer than usual
derek waits quietly at the doors
finally they open
derek steps out onto the platform together with the old man the college kid and guzman
colter remains on board standing in the exit area watching
as usual derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car and starts toward the station house
guzman is ahead of him already pushing open the doors to the station
all is quiet
perhaps too quiet
derek approaches the station and sees
in station lobby are police officers
dereks jaw tightens
he changes course heading instead for an outdoor stairwell
coming up the stairs however are more police officers
wheeling around derek heads the other way
walking faster but keeping his head
not running not panicking
the train oddly is still sitting there
as he nears the other end of the platform more officers appear from behind columns cutting off his escape
the police are coming from all sides converging on the platform
yet no one panics
no one runs
finally derek frost
derek goes to get back on the train
the doors however slide shut in his face
through the closed doors derek looks in at colter still on the train
they stare at one another through the window
please turn to face us
an entire phalanx of police officers is on the platform
whats this about
unseen by the officers derek has taken out his cell phone and is dialing it as he turns around
the police approach cautiously
place your hands in the air
raising his hands he pushes send on his phone
on board the train theres a ringing
the detonator phone has been removed from the bomb and now rings harmlessly in the hand of the trains security officer
the restroom door is open and swarming with conductors examining the bomb
on the platform the officers tackle derek subduing him
passengers watch at the windows mesmerized
once again please return to your seats ladies and gentlemen
no ones moving from the windows
except for colter who stands off by himself
the first look of satisfaction weve ever seen on his face
an alarm is going off
at a locked door an air force locksmith is in the process of disabling the key pad
rutledge paces livid
i want to know who reprogrammed this lock
and if you dont get this open in ten seconds ill see that youre busted back down to private
im already a private sir
just open it
a mans life is at stake
the key pad goes green and the pressure lock releases
rutledge tears open the door
armed military police clatter down the steps
he locks another door behind him
he is shaken but nevertheless going forward
in the chamber three medics monitor gauges and screens
one of them stands up to block his way
sorry i cant let you pass
goodwin removes the patch on his uniform to reveal the insignia of a major
thats an order
we all know your rank goodwin but i have explicit orders from rutledge not to bam
goodwin drops the medic with a splintering headbutt
im glad you know my rank
were you also aware im in the special forces
the train has been evacuated as police investigators search the rest of the cars
hoards of passengers fill the platform as conductors try to herd them towards the station
ladies and gentlemen rail service has been cancelled
please clear the platform and proceed into the station
new jersey transit apologizes for the inconvenience
police cars parked everywhere
two detectives are questioning the computer engineer
so you have no idea how your cell phone was used to call in the tip
people mill about waiting for the buses groaning and complaining
christina accosts a passing transit employee
how do we get to work
you guys have some busses or something
the transit employee ignores her and walks away
im talking to you
she stands there in exasperation
this whole thing has been designed to thwart her
nearby colter sits on a bench
aint life grand
looking over she notices him
now im going get fired for being late
maybe thats a good thing
she gives him a sharp look
rutledge runs now leading the detachment of mps
shoot him if you have to you hear me
the mps exchange a look of annoyance at being ordered around by this guy
a heavy inner door has been opened
the beeping of life support systems
the compressions of a ventilator
goodwin approaches a gurney
a jungle of tubes and lines lead from the gurney into advanced machinery
a somber look on his face
as goodwin edges forward we reveal the bare foot of someone lying there
a digital timer reads minute
at the facilitys outer door the locksmith goes to work on another panel as rutledge and the mps stand by
give me twenty seconds
make it ten
rutledge looks at his watch
it reads seconds
it also reads seconds
his work is done
hes saved her
saved them all
at least this one time
only she doesnt know that
christina stands there arms crossed scowling at the parking lot
could this day get any worse
that train was taking you to a place you didnt want to be
but then you got off
and maybe thats a sign
she takes out her cell phone
the stress of her day
im calling a cab
maybe ill only be somewhat late for work
colter watches her a quiet ache inside
maybe some people dont want to be saved
the noise from the outer door grows louder
the mps are only seconds from getting inside
goodman moves towards the life support equipment
as he does we glimpse a horrifying sight the upper half of colters body his real body inside a sterile tent of transparent plastic
his skull has been removed
a massive apparatus has been infused directly onto his brain
goodwin takes a long last look
thank you for your service
time to go home
goodwins hand goes to the switch to shut off life support
his eyes on the clock
it reads seconds
christina on the phone waiting as it dials
colter gets up
you can do anything you want with your life
starting right now
shes taken aback
he starts walking off
metro cab dispatch
a long beat as she watches him
she shuts her phone
is she crazy
shes baffled by her own action
and by this unusual guy here
she crosses her arms archly
you cant just expect someone to change her life just like that
at the very least
youd have to buy that person coffee and explain your reasons
she waits for his response
uneasy at putting herself out there
colters watch ticks down to the final seconds
his last moments in this world
he has only time enough for a final look of reassurance
maybe some other time
disappointment flickers on her face
she turns to go
behind her is a stone wall
a bicycle is parked against it
colters breath catches in his throat
this is it
this is the mysterious scene hes been seeing
his watch hits zero
the digital timer also hits zero
the outer door opens
rutledge rushes in accompanied by mps
goodwin backs away from the gurney hands in the air
the beeping has given way to a monotone
all of colters vital signs have flatlined
rutledge frantically goes to reconnect the machines but goodwin has turned off too many of them
get a medical team in here
but the mps just stare at the appalling sight of colters exposed brain
what are you standing there for
we can save him
no one moves
rutledge rashly grabs for one of the mps rifles
i guess force is the only thing you people understa back away sir now
the mp has leveled his rifle at rutledge
who steps back aghast
his authority has vanished with colters life
goodwin shuts off the monitors
silence fills the room
colter is dead
rutledge stares sorrowfully at colters body
then at goodwin with burning hatred
youre a murderer
goodwin offers his hands to the mp
go ahead and arrest me
but the mp does nothing
ill be around
whenever you want me
they part as he walks out of the room
a look of grim satisfaction on his face
christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone wall
shes about to enter a tunnel that goes under the tracks
the same tunnel from colters vision
something tells her to turn around
the bench where colter sat is empty
but three feet away
colter is standing there
dumbfounded he looks at his watch it remains at zero
he looks all around
trees stirring in the breeze
a bird flies overhead
the crowd of passengers outside the station
colter turns to her
how can this be
hes afraid to even speak
as if that alone could break the enchantment
but the world is here
it goes on
thats all he knows
finally he swallows
finding his voice
the least i can do is buy you coffee
this pleases christina although she tries not to show it
okay well come on then
walking forward he joins her
the two of them disappear down the tunnel
a beautiful morning
