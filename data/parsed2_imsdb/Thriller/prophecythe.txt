screenplay by gregory widen with the sound of wind of sand gritting against glass a howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny woodplank church
inside huddled together against the rage outside are a small group of people
all in black mostly elderly they kneel in prayer
before them on the cramped altar lies a man
dressed in the uniform of a general surrounded by the silk softness of his casket
hes an old man far from the crump of battles consumed now with stillness listening to the prayers of old people
of desert wind moaning through thin wood
the candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless gusts strains for life then goes out
its not the best part of town and probably never was
a place of seedy anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting fire escapes lying on an alley unique only for its bad drainage
its here in the dim flinty light that a figure enters
wearing a long coat and despite the night sunglasses he pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the flophouses to their yellowish windows and competing mexican
one window dark and quiet on the third floor catches his gaze
theres a metal hand railing in the alley that the long coated figure effortlessly pops up onto
sunglasses focused on the window he lowers himself into a motionless crouch a perch on the railing with the ease of a crow
or a gargoyle
dawn is a muddled limp thing that does nothing to improve the alley
the figure is still there a motionless gargoyle perched on the railing
watching the window
the shadows shorten the air grows warmer and now theres movement behind the window
the sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing jumps up to the first rung of the fire escape and begins climbing
is a room as grim as we expect
lumpy iron bed sink thats been pissed into one too many times and simon a man in a tight sweater and dark sunglasses busily emptying his pockets on the ruined
dresser loose change a town papers obituary column
simons sunglassed eyes look up suddenly his body stifffening
he whips around to face the window just as it explodes into fragments
the gargoyle leaps into the room on the trail of glass
simon spins and throws himself against the intruder
the two struggle savagely across the room smashing chairs
simon manages a grip on the gargoyles face and pounds the back of his skull against the wall
the gargoyle gets his locked fists up and swings them like a war club smacking simons face and sprawling him backwards onto the bed
the two across the room for each other pause
where is it
simons climbed to his feet the two men in sunglasses now walking slow circles around each other
leave me alone
youve found it havent you
the gargoyle drops his head and drives himself into simon who hammers the gargoyle with his fists
the gargoyles gotten free a knife that he jams into simons leg
pressing home his advantage the gargoyle slams simon up against the wall
he tears open simons shirt digging his fingers into the chest ripping the skin aside the first plunging deep cracking the sternum bone pushing even further toward the blood gouged
pumping beneath simon plows his knee up between the gargoyles legs
over and over
till the grip loosens and simon shoves him to one side using the momentum and drives to swing the body around and at the shattered window
the gargoyle smacks the frame and collapses his head cracking on the sill and forcing a shard of glass through his neck
simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyles sunglasses revealing two totally empty eye sockets
pushing his thumbs into them simon uses the leverage to lift the gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window
the gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape then spread eagles thirty feet to the asphalt
somebody turns up their mexican radio station
the gargoyles a wreck
but he manages slowly his shattered remains arguing every inch to climb first to his knees then miserably to his feet
a bent splattered hopeless thing that manages to stumble three or four feet before being hit by a freeway speed firebird bombing down the alley
the impact pins the gargoyle to the grill and rams him into a brick wall crushing a chest that belches out a sickly bruised heart like a wet rag against
the firebirds windshield
simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle
his own shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing is difficult
pain flashes across his forehead as he checks that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of his nose
at the sound of a distant siren simon turns and quickly finishes packing his duffle bag
stiffly pulling on an oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage beneath he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out
the gargoyle still pinned to the wall by the firebird
a flash bounces off his skin
hes being photographed
go wide and find him in the middle of a police investigation
bored blue uniforms yellow barrier tape
a plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits thomas dagget thirties tweed coat and steel notebook
he smiles at a couple of cops ducks under the yellow barrier and nods a greeting to an older uniform sergeant burrows
looks up at sky thought those clouds this morning spelled rain for sure but its turned into a beautiful day wouldnt you say sergeant burrows
thomas takes a deep healthy breath
burrows just stares at him
i warned you about that cheerful shit
im working on it
he eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle
whats the word
friend here did a half gainer with a firebird tuck from the third floor
not unless he decided not to bother opening the window first
well he wasnt exactly in a condition to walk a chalk line when we got here
youre welcome to try and smell his breath if you like that is if you can find the mouth
ghouls been by
on their way
willie promises a white paper tomorrow
or wednesday depending on his golf game
burrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man sitting on the curb
was taking a short cut to his job at a packing plant on san pedro
first thing he remembers about the deceased is several vital organs bouncing off his windshield
have you had him walk a chalk line
shook up some
looking at gargoyle anything on him
no wallet license nothing
he is missing one or two things though
looking at tangled mess along with everything else
weve found everything else and what fun that was let me tell you but the eyes are still awol
might just be stuck in the radiator grill
little weird though
both popping out together like that
worth a page in my scrapbook
burrows and thomas coming up the stairs
whos the room registered under
anything interesting inside
there are what an intelligent experienced detective like yourself could possibly construe as signs of a struggle
they enter the room which is of course totally trashed
thomas steps over the splintered furniture
naturally nobody saw or heard anything
in such a fine establishment as this
thomas looks at the splashes of blood overturned dressers a newspaper the chimney rock republican one name in its obit section circled
burrows sighs and checks his watch
ku sans on fourteenth is still open for another hour
whatdya say we pull out the ol suicide rubber stamp and get some lunch
rancid chow mein and watered beer for under three bucks
looking at floor theres glass in the carpet
that usually happens when you break a window
its on the inside
amongst the glass fragments at thomas feet is a pair of dark sunglasses
he picks them up taps them in his palm and looks out the window down to the man with no eyes pinched between brick and chrome
wheres chimney rock
arizona desert i think
which is exactly where im going to be in two years three months
and give up all this
youre breaking my heart
the sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating expanse of desert
travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens and silhouettes tall finger like spires of volcanic rock
hear the coyotes the wind making its constant probing search
before the night swallows it all whole come upon the town
it used to be something
but thats long gone
now wrapped in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night its a shell of a place
lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one
the ghosts are the majority here
biding their time
waiting for the town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the desert
the wind slinks over the hills creeps down past boarded up storefronts skeletal ocitillo and the rusting hulks of abandoned mining equipment
the corpse of a summers kite twists slowly on a power line
from the inky oblivion of the road comes a crunch of gravel
stands a large nineteenth century brick schoolhouse
an icon from a more prosperous past its dark massiveness was meant for scores of ruddy faced miners kids
now it seems to be imploding eating itself with creeping decay
on this night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner and the faint sound of childrens voices in song
it is a hymn
an ancient latin one
the melancholy beauty of voices rising and falling in choir
is a school auditorium
on the stage dwarfed by it are twenty five students from first grade to high school singing together as a choir
a young woman katherine directs their acapella voices as the small group of parents lonely in the huge room look on
the voices drift on the night down the road and lap against the peeling facade of a storefront
the rooms are dark but for one
there bathed in the flickering light of a tall candle lies the body of the old general we saw at the opening
of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside
a small panes of glass beside it is broken by a hand
young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain of centuries
faces white mexican navaho
katherine guides them with soft hands
she smiles in pride
they smile back
of themselves and the beauty coming from their mouths
one small beautiful navaho girl mary maybe eight gets a special smile of special friendship from katherine
front door now stands ajar in the darkness
small shards of glass glisten in the carpet
is the dead general
even in the bleached ravages of age and death his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride
it takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize someone is there with him
simon in his oversized surplus jacket
his arms are folded tightly across his middle as if in deep cold
but his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his breath is shallow and uneven
he stares at the old man behind sunglasses and takes slow cautious steps forward into the amber glow
holding out two blood stained fingers simon touches the generals forehead
a new strain crosses his perspiring face
placing his right palm on the generals chin and the left on his forehead simon cracks open the dead mans mouth
the hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing
simon leans down to the open mouth and in a voice soft and deeply weary qui ex patre flioque procedit
then with the school choir distant and faint in the night the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man
its coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children and congratulate their young teacher
even in this gloomy crumbling building its a warm small town moment
simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty through the silent streets leaning against shop walls for support
through the doors out steps the eight year old navaho girl mary
alone she stands on the stone stairs and looks out into the night with sensitive eyes
katherine follows her out
hey bright eyes whats the deal being out here all alone without a coat
the girls eyes seem too serious for a childs
katherine looks out into the night
mary stares a moment longer then becomes a child again smiling and popping katherine one on the arm
pig out on all the cake
oh there might be one tiny skinny piece left but youre gonna have to race me for it
mary suddenly points past katherines shoulder
when katherine turns mary dashes back into the building
you little sneak
katherine chases after her
simon comes limping up from the road
his breathings bad now as he moves stiffly along the schools brick walls coming to an old rusty back door he creaks open and slides through
he climbs a littered and disused staircase past broken beer bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor
its part of the school building long abandoned
doors to classrooms lie half off their hinges windows are broken rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres
simon his breath echoing in the cold darkness shuffles along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut in the wall where a row of lockers used to
he crawls into the space and there surrounded by rot curls up on himself and sucks his thumb
thomas daggets eyes opening slowly
he sits up in his bed runs a hand through his hair and looks out with only medium enthusiasm at the morning
thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief silent prayer
he crosses himself stands and walks for the door
before leaving he glances back at the altar
a questioning moment between two akward estranged friends
thomas sits at his desk half heartily trying to make sense of the three dozen files piled there
paul his boss leans against a wall nearby
hows it going
i was just looking for my suicide rubber stamp
sorry about leaving you without a partner
everythings up in the air till the commission settles their manpower budget
his phone rings dagget
its done already
smiles must have rained over the golf course this morning
ill be right over
a set of golf clubs rest forelornly in the corner
an irritable looking coroner fumes behind his desk as thomas enters
hey willie sorry to hear about the weather
the coroner just stares at him
should i bother sitting
thomas obeys as the coroner spreads out a stack of white sheets
where would you like me to start
i think we can skip the cause of death
to begin with your man has no eyes
werent stuck in the radiator grill
no he never had any eyes
we checked the sockets
theres no optic nerve muscle pores loose viscus nothing
we also did a toxicology on his blood high sodium elevated selenium no floating cholesterol platelets trace ammonia
something wrong with that
no its actually pretty common for an aborted fetus
rubs eyes i should have listened to burrows
we also did a bone section
wasnt that much trouble since most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway
when babies grow up their bones get larger by adding calcium layers over the interior haversham canals
child growth isnt uniform though comes in spurts that always leave growth rings in the bone
everybody has them except your man
that would to a hasty observer seem to indicate he had never been a child
i assume you a cautious and learned observer of course have an explanation
not even remotely
want to hear the last one
not even remotely
hes a hermaphrodite
thomas stares at him has both male and female sex organs
think of the possibilities
yeah you can be impotent and frigid all at the same time they dont normally work
thomas sighs and climbs to his feet
well id love to say thank you but oh i also have a bonus prize for you
the coroner opens his desk and pulls out a small ancient looking leather bound book
found this sealed in his coat lining
thomas turns it over in his hand
its a bible
a pretty old one i think
thomas runs his finger across the gold leaf cover
we checked it out inside
thought there might be a name or fingerprint somewhere
all we found was a curled page marking the fourteenth chapter of st
there is no fourteenth chapter to revelations
maybe this is the teachers edition
thomas opens the bible and there it is in latin the fourteenth chapter
can i keep this awhile
beat can you sit on all this a few days willie
not circulate the file
i need some time before all the questions start
oooh are we breaking the rules again
so what else is new
thomas at his desk working under a lone gooseneck lamp
hes translating the fourteenth chapter of st
johns revelations from latin onto a slip of paper
finished he sets the ancient bible down turns off the gooseneck and leans back in his chair alone in the dark
here outside the town horizons are distant faraway things
the sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open
its katherine the teacher
wearing levis and boots she carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies impatiently
in a minute in a minute
katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it down as the sun still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs begins to heat up the sky
deep and narrow an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone walls smoothed rounded and etched by centuries of wind
a tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked sycamore
a silent place a long way and a long time from anything but the approach of galloping hooves
katherine and her horse run full out through the canyon the clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep shadowed walls
horse and rider drive each other harder and harder their hot breath brief clouds in the arch thin desert air
boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat deep wind cut caves hiding scorpions sidewinders or a wary mountain lion all pass as in a blur arrogant hawks and patient
buzzards ruins of thousand year old anasazi villages high on the cliffs their weather beaten skulls seen and unseen staring out everything is one smear of color and smell as katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail out of the canyon and onto the main plateau
katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots
she pulls a thermos from the pack sits down against some old man rocks and with the coffee steaming in her hand greets the sun now cresting the chuska mountains
theres a rutted silty dirt road nearby
an ancient battered school bus rattles its way past and stops
the bus driver a navaho john climbs down and rubbing the side of his head painfully walks up to katherine
you could save my life with some coffee
he holds out an empty cup katherine fills
sipping painfully he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball cap over his eyes
you dont want to hear about it
peeks out hopefully or maybe you do
the bus is full of young school kids
shouldnt they be getting to school
impromptu field trip
im broadening their minds
and sparing them the sight of their beloved chauffeur barfing his guts out
katherines horse snorts
i hate horses
how was the canyon
honey suckle out yet
didnt see any
i hate that canyon
i hate this this whole plateau
too many goddamn ghosts
leave it to them i say
san diego thats where im going
i like the sound of that
im happy here
oh lord protect us another romantic pale face in love with the desert
just got to give it a chance
try growing up here
tries word out on tongue ox nard
sticks out coffee cup uno mas see boo play
she pours speaking of romantic pale faces the rumor mill is in high gear again
who this time
that funny looking guy from window rock
the bia lawyer
non committal huh
say it isnt so
it isnt so
he finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet
thanks for the joe
youre a credit to the community
he shuffles back to the bus
all right children looks sharp
this is a school day
and no talking loud
the bus coughs alive and crawls forward
katherine waves to the faces behind glass then settles back for a last moment of peace as silence lays again over the land
showered and changed into her teaching clothes katherine climbs into a rattling pickup
katherine drives to work passing on the outskirts the closed copper mine vast and abandoned
down beyond the fading main street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school
katherine parks her truck grabs her leather bag and walks in
katherines lecturing her students
all twenty five of them
theres high school age sons of white ranchers navaho girls on the edge of puberty tiny mexican children
all being taught together in one room
its dinosaur day
katherine has a large fossilized bone on her lap
this is camposaurus
camposaurus was a herbavore which meant he only ate plants
camposaur stayed mostly to himself and never bothered anyone
the little girls smile
they like camposaurus
katherine holds up another bone fragment
this is a leg fragment that belongs to the killer of the plateau alosaurus
alosaurus was a vicious carnivore which meant hed eat anything that moved especially nice juicy camposaurs
the little boys grin
they like alosaurus
both these guys lived together right here on the white rock plateau eighty million years ago when this area used to be on the banks of a huge shallow sea
remember how we talked about how sedimentation fossilizes bones
thats also what made the hills out behind our town and put the copper in the ground
lot of good that did us
katherine lifts off the desk an ancient s gieger counter and switches it on
it ticks softly when she points it at the dino bone
just a tiny bit alex
do you know why
uranium thats the rock they use in nuclear power plants and bombs
and bombs alex yes is all through these hills naturally
millions of years ago the dinosaurs here ate plants and drank water which had uranium in it that became concentrated in their bones which is exactly how with mr
geiger counter here were going to find some
the class cheers
with the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background katherines class trudges its way up the barren rocky hillside behind the town
the teenage ranchers kids try to make time with the mexican girls one of the little boys has gotten into a shoving match with a little girl
coming between them hey
whats the deal brian
the girl folds her arms defiantly
the boy is pissed embarrassed
she she called me a dick head
well he is
all right brian
you get one free insult
make it good
looks at brian cow demon
katherines given the geiger counter to the little navaho girl mary
focusing grimly on the rock in front of her mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it begins clicking softly
i got one
i got one
the high school kids come up and help dig
dont break it
almost immediately an eye socket appears in the dust
as the students carefully brush away the dust katherine looks back across the crumbly path
a coyote has crept up onto a near ledge
it just stands there
its mostly empty at this time of day and the young man sitting in the pew staring at the altar is alone
his name is gabriel and he wears jeans a faded leather jacket and dark sunglasses even inside
his thin hair is slicked back and theres an almost feminine quality about him
he sits there a moment longer staring then gets up and leaves
the alley from the beginning
gabriel pulls his old convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse
he comes upstairs to the landing where the door to the room is covered with a strip of yellow tape police investigation
gabriel pulls the tape aside and kicks the door open
its still the disaster we remember
gabriel walks slowly through the room
he scratches up some blood tastes it
theres spray painted outlines where the police have removed certain items
gabriel takes note of this tastes the blood again and leaves
its lunch break
most of the students sit in loose cliques around the front of the building eating skipping rope picking fights
the recently unearthed skull sits on katherines desk
feet up beside it she leans back in her chair looking through a dinosaur book
one of her students a twelve year old boy finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her
im all done with the cleaning miss henley
thank you jason
i appreciate it
looking at book over her shoulder find out what it is yet
well its either a million year old strychtosaurus or that cow mr
sorenson lost last winter
the boy still standing beside her begins to look nervous
slowly he lets his weight rest against katherines shoulder
she smiles good naturedly up at him
go eat your lunch jason
the boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up almost relieved
sure miss henley
katherine watches him leave smiles again and goes back to the book
on the abandoned back stairs a couple of mexican boys sit smoking cigarettes
they whistle and kid with the four young girls that pass them going up the steps
is the abandoned decayed part of the building
the four girls know theyre not supposed to be here and thats probably half the fun
they run through the crumbling halls giggling and hiding from one another
their cries the smack of their shoes echo off off the peeling halls
one of them is mary running down a hall banging a stick with another girl
at a corner mary peels off from her friend runs down a new hall turns a corner and comes on simon
hes still curled where we last saw him in the wall niche where some lockers used to be
the two stare at one another
whats your name
you dont look so good simon
no i dont
does miss henley know youre here
no one does mary
can we keep it just our secret
for a little while
you can hear her friends coming closer
i have to go
it was nice meeting you mary
mary goes to leave stops turns back
are you hungry
i could bring something
that would be very nice
she smiles and runs down the hall
simon grits his teeth turns to the wall and prepares himself for a long long day
an old fifties two level polynesian lamps and glitter stucco now faded and browinish with water stains
gabriel the young man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking down the door at the flophouse walks up the apartments stairs to the second level knocks
once and opens the door
hasnt been very well looked after lately
either has the occupant
sitting slumped in a kitchen chair staring at the floor he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem to register his visitor
gee jerry you look like shit
the eyes lift to gabriel revealing a pale bloodless face eaten with dried sores
leave me alone gabriel
gabriel drops into the chair across from jerry and pushes aside with distaste the maggot ridden plates of food piled on the table
he reaches his hand out to jerry
sing song like to a baby come here
gabriel puts his hand under jerrys chin and turns the face side to side examining the cracked decaying skin and filmy eyes
still a little life left in you
gabriel releases jerrys chin and slouches down in the chair
theres something i want you to do for me
what a surprise
dont be that way
i just want to
why wont you let me
i will i will
a dark intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of jerrys pant leg
you need some new clothes son
a tear wells in jerrys decomposing face
aw come on dont start
you know how i hate that
im so tired
im so goddamn tired
watch the profanity
just one more favor
deep sigh what
i want you to get something for me
a few personal effects the cops ripped off from the lovely allenwood arms on seventh street
itll be sitting in their property room down on san julian
im supposed to just go in there
give you a bath put on some decent clothes beat maybe a very large brim hat youll be fine
just go in between five and five ten its a shift change and nobodyll notice you
how do you know
cocks an eye cmon
tosses yellow id card onto table this should be more or less up to date
got a name this stuff is under
why doesnt that surprise me
gabriel gets up pats jerry on the head and walks to the door
ill see you tonight
flips him silver dollar heres some bus fare
the slam of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of an indoor court
it ricochets off the ceiling hits the back glass partition and is slammed again
four players including thomas grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor
shoulders and knees bang off one another
one of the players falls back yells to thomas
thomas dives into position to make the save recovers and yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner
pop it up
the player slams it brutally at thomas who misses miserably
thanks a lot
another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around thomas
youre missing the point of the game thomas
you must absolutely trust no one
form alliances but break them
lure another to trust you then betray him
you play with too much honor
sink to the gutter
lie and double cross them
player tosses the ball to thomas who serves and the scuffling is back on
shouts to one another
promises of support
come on thomas lets take out sam together
thomas and player team up on a third player pressing him hard
suddenly thomas breaks back intercepts the ball and drives against player
the about face is too abrupt for him and player is eliminated in a double cross
he smiles proudly at thomas
thomas and the three players congratulate each other on the evil and treachery in each others strategies as they shower down
the important thing tom is seeing the game for what it is
a sickening hopeless giant sucking hole of depravity
as thomas combs his hair and slips on his regimental detectives suit n tie the other three put on their black pants shirts and stiff white roman collars
two of the priests hoist their gym bags and head for the door
see ya guys next tuesday huh
thomas is left alone with player priest bill
so hows work
life on the dark side
beat can i ask you about something
it has to stay between us
i need your word on it
as a racquetball player or a priest
ill take the priest for the moment
whats on your mind
its a case
we found this guy
but he had on him an old bible
he pulls the bible out of a cloth sack and hands it to bill
its a vichini
worth a little
more than a little
theyre the best
vichini only did twenty each pocket size for a king to carry into battle beside his heart
some consider them the finest bibles ever made
i thought theyd all be in museums
what are you doing with it
this ones a bit special
its has a bonus chapter to st johns revelations
what does it say
reading from slip of paper and as in the first war the angels so fought over the nature of their god and there was much vanity and destruction in heaven
for some angels called their lord the son of god and others called him the begotten father of jesus christ
what do you think
ive never heard that quote before
theologically the first war obviously refers to the war in heaven where michael the archangel threw out satan and his gang
old time bible stuff
but this implies there was a second war
thats news to me
and the rest of it
oh its a fairly common theological debate
the idea that if christ is gods son does that make him less than god or are they the same being in different forms
that very argument almost tore the early christian church apart in the th century
that was the good old days when people actually worried about theology
anyway it was settled when the bishops of the world got to together at the council of nicene in and hashed out the various interpretations of scripture into a uniform
dogma of belief
the result was the nicene creed which basically said that christ was in fact the same as god and was owed the same power and respect as the father
that they were the same
smiles but its not exactly the sort of thing angels would fight over
well they could just ask god right
do you think its possible that john might have written that extra chapter
vichini was the greatest biblical scholar of the age some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings
maybe he did find some unknown writings by john
its possible i suppose
john always was a little negative about angels
all this actually has something to do with an lapd murder
i dont know yet
i hate to break it you but that particular family spat has been settled for years
nobody loses sleep over it anymore
what did john have against angels
oh he didnt trust them much
all that running around smiting and killing in the name of the lord
gods wild bunch
he thought it made them fickle and vain
one click above ghosts
satan didnt help the image much either
well he did start as an angel
thomas walks bill out to his car
so when are you going to get a real job
you mean with the church
you almost did it once
i never saw a seminary student more called to the collar than you
why didnt you ever become ordained
its a long story
youll have to tell it to me sometime
the building is squat and brick
a non descrip warehouse that subs as a police evidence storage area
the sun is hard today as it beats down on jerrys large brimmed felt hat
daylight and jerry dont get along very well
his sunken filmy eyes squint at its glare
the decayed flesh cracking along his cheeks flames at its touch
he shuffles down the sidewalk the brackish amber fluid that gurgles down his leg filling his shoes and leaving behind shiny wet footprints like a snail
theres nobody around the back door and its unlocked
jerrys shrunken claws pull it open
is a crush of filing cabinets and erector set shelves
all of it crammed with low grade stuff
the heroin busts and million dollar currency arrests dont end up here
here its all shoe boxes and dusty files
fragments of small lives forgotten
jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works his way past rack after rack
the single uniform he meets looks only casually at jerrys lapel id badge
its on the third shelf he finds it
jerry lifts the box and walks out
gabriel steps off the elevator and follows the signs for medical examiner
along the way he passes a checkpoint guard
need a pass friend
ill just be a second
gabriel walks back to the guard smiles and knocks him clean out of his chair with the back of his arm
the guard smacks against the wall and crumples out of view
tiled floor and refrigerated corpses
nobodys around when gabriel enters
he walks over to a file cabinet and removes a thick folder
then he walks to the big filing cabinets the ones that hold a body in each drawer
he strolls along tapping each label till he finds the one hes looking for slides it open and looks down at the naked body of the gargoyle
hes been sewed back together
gabriel grabs the eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the arms like a crucifix
from his coat gabriel takes out a small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyles feet and hands
then with the tip of his finger he draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead stands and walks for the door
in the background as gabriel leaves we see the body of the gargoyle burst into flame
katherines students are shuffling back from lunch to their seats making small talk and paper airplanes
katherine does a head count then stops a young boy coming through the door
brian have you seen mary
i think shes out back somewhere
to girl allison
we havent seen her since lunch
were you guys up in the
the girls marys friends shrug innocently
okay everybody get started on todays reading
ill be right back
katherine closes the door behind her
the class immediately erupts into goofing off
the door opens again
i mean quiet
katherine walks through decayed and rusting halls
calls out mary
its spooky up here
a part of the building katherine clearly dislikes
to herself shit
katherine calls out marys name a few more times turns a few more corners and suddenly comes on her
marys sitting beside simon the bleeding ashen faced man with sunglasses
shes giving simon a piece of sandwich and a coke
katherine is instantly wary
mary come here
but simon and i were come here
mary reluctantly walks over to katherine
go back to class
mary frowns waves once to simon and leaves
theres a heaviness to the air around simon
a kind of buzzing
katherine blinks her eyes a few times
she wasnt doing any harm
its not her im worried about
what are you doing here
mostly done now
just passing through
this is school property you cant sleep here
it wasnt part of the plan
notices blood stains are you all right
katherine rubs the side of her temple
ill have to call the police
i wish you wouldnt but i understand
theyll help you
oh i rather doubt that
katherine turns and leaves her footsteps fading
mary appears again
i thought youd left
im very clever
im sure you are
beat you were nice to give me the food
i havent much time mary
and since youve been so nice to me theres something id very much like to give to you
just for a little while
something very special
can you keep it a secret
the biggest secret ever
what is it
come here mary
she takes a couple of shy steps toward him
as she does katherine outside the building rounding up some of the kids who decided to take an impromptu recess
hustling the last one up the stairs she pauses suddenly
she hears something
katherine walks back around the side of the building and sees mary bent over vomiting
katherine rushes up to her
i dont feel good
whats the matter pumpkin
did you eat something
concerned beat did he give you something
mary coughs up the last of her lunch
can i go home now
katherine wipes off marys mouth with a hanky
katherine drives mary home a dusty tired mobile home slumped among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town
mary and katherine pull open the door and enter
marys elderly grandmother is sitting watching all my children
she smiles at katherine and looks at mary with concern as the little girl rubs her stomach and explains something in navaho
katherine helps tuck mary in bed as her grandmother brings a glass of water
ill have the school send over a doctor
the grandmother sits beside mary whispers gently in navaho and softly stokes her brow
on the phone hes was just laying up there
i thought with the kids and everything
most of my boys are up the highway on a tanker spill at the moment
they may be a while
these people are rarely any problem
ill have a deputy come by tonight or tomorrow and shoo him out
he looked hurt
they all do maam
inside or out theyre all damaged goods
alone and tucked into bed mary stares off at something very very far away
the sun orange and fading outside his window thomas drifts off into a nap on his couch
the phone rings
its your friendly coroner
why is my friendly coroner after a long day at work calling me at home
i have something youll want to see
i doubt it
no youll definitely want to see this
on the floor is the smoldering blackened outline of a body
a thick slimy goo gurgles and pops
the whole room is afoul with acrid smoke
they also took the autopsy file
he she it
they took it
they also lifted all the physical evidence from the san julian impound
where was everyone
the cop at the desk is in the hospital as we speak with a broken collarbone
everyone else was down the hall watching the basketball playoffs
foul on the buzzer
thomas jams his hands in his pockets and leans against an autopsy table
watches the smoke curl slowly up from the impossibly melted goo in front of him
looks like the snow angels we used to make as kids
lie down in a clean bank
move your arms up and down
you know what this means
our friends cleaned out all the evidence on this guy
did the cop get a look at who nailed him
smiled a lot
he wore sunglasses
thomas pulls out out his notebook
you gonna figure this one out tom
im going to try
when you do give me a call
tell me im not crazy
gabriel crouches on the linoleum and pours everything out of the evidence box onto the floor
he sifts through it a smile appearing when comes across the chimney rock republican and its circled obituary
you like the desert jerry
jerry is looking worse by the day
a rotting oozing fissure has opened on his forehead
his right eye doesnt move anymore
he sits on a kitchen chair glumly
you promised that soon
dont be a pest about it
sighs never trust a fucking angel
thomas sits hunched over his notes from the first day of the investigation
written in it is the chimney rock republican and the obituary name of general arnold hawthorn
paul sits down in the chair opposite
do you ever have one of those afternoons where you feel no ones giving you a straight answer about anything
oh maybe five or six times a week
reading sheet it says here somebody got into the property warehouse and cleaned everything out of your evidence box
no he did leave one thing
mud on his shoes
thomas slowly closes his notebook
im not going to get a straight answer out of you either am i
rubs his eyes tiredly
i need to go to arizona
for your health
so i can give you a straight answer
sure why not
take the kids
see the grand canyon
send me a fucking postcard
ive got a headache tom and i hate my life
if you have to go go
on an utterly lonely blacktop gabriel shoots by in his top down rambler insignificant in the nights vastness
jerrys in the back feet up on the seat
why do you need me
i can hardly walk now
some things are human work son
live or dead human work
besides i like you
gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes screeching the rambler to a dusty stop
he kills the engine and everything is instantly whispering night and coyote howls
gabriel climbs out and walks to the edge of a cliff
far below nestled among the finger like spires of volcanic cones lies the town
twinkling lights in a cold dark embrace
gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles
i can always smell a graveyard
two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in the dust nearby
on a low hill at the edge of town
cracked sinking headstones
the ramblers parked next to a new one slim pickens on the am as jerry digs up the fresh grave marked general arnold hawthorne
gabriel sits perched on the headstone over the grave like a winged creature
i hope youre enjoying this
i always enjoy watching you work jerry
how did i ever get you in my life
come on you didnt really want to kill yourself
but i did it didnt i
i did kill myself
and youre just keeping me alive
letting you die slower
im so in your debt
thank you jerry
jerrys shovel clanks onto something hard
he scrapes away the dirt revealing a coffin lid
with a socket wrench jerry removes the fastening bolts then with the edge of his shovel pries open the lid
its the ancient wasted general we saw at the beginning
his medals flash in the moonlight
not much to look at
ah but its not whats on the outside that matters gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave
its whats on the inside
gabriel reaches down places one hand on the generals forehead one on his chin and breaks the mouth open
he gazes down into it
then suddenly stiffens and straightens up
upset its not here
gabriel frantically look in the ears
up the nose
its not here
oooh bad news for the war effort
spins wildly on him shut up
gabriel bangs the coffin lid in frustration
tries to think
now if you were a soul where would you hide
the hell away from you
the numbers on the clock radio roll over five am and the news comes on
thomas stirs in bed rubs his eyes and looks out at a sky untouched by any sign of dawn
in coat and tie thomas sits in his spartan kitchen stirring a coffee when the phone rings
hey little brother
hows the world
the worlds the usual
except for a guppy
the worlds minus one guppy this morning
and jamie and mac
they keep asking for uncle tommy
the only man that can make stuffed bears talk
my one true calling
what do you mean
its five thirty in the morning
beat i just thought i should call
you always were telepathic
thomas looks up at his overnight bag sitting half packed on the dresser
its my job jan
i go places sometimes
i just had this terrible feeling about it
whats happening tom
i dont know
i miss you
even when youre here
i miss you
i miss my brother
its been four years tom since
were the only blood family we have left you and me
i worry about you
ill be okay
sorry about the dawn attack call
i love you
i love you too jan
he cradles the phone stares at it then picks up his overnight bag
silent and dead at this hour
gabriels boots creak on the floorboards of the th century plank sidewalks
he taps his finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows
boy what a dump huh
jerry limping on a foot thats caving in on itself wiping the spinal fluid out of his dead eye shuffles along behind
gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk grabs a parking meter and swings himself playfully around
why cant this shit ever go down in miami
or bora bora
i feel like ive spent my whole damn stay in gin swills like this
lifes a bitch
gabriel suddenly freezes
he sticks his nose up sniffs like a coyote then abruptly drops to the ground in a push up and smells the dirt
tastes it with his tongue
a fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows and falls dully across shapes old shapes forgotten and one shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor
its simon breath a rasp blood soaked pants leaving a long smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail
he coughs drags an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses and looks up at a pair of black lizard skin boots
simon rolls on his back and sighs
simon looks up at puss faced jerry leaning quietly in a dark corner
dont mind me
just along for the ride
gabriel sits down against the wall
so what shall we talk about
im a little talked out on theology
gabriel turns his boot to the moon watches the pale light glint back off the lizard scales
you know why im here
dont happen to have it on you by chance
that would have been too easy
simon suddenly jumps to his feet
tries to escape
jerry trips him sprawling simon back to the floor
gabriel walks over to him
puts his face close
wheres the soul
beat you know
used to reside in the recently departed general hawthorne
simon doesnt answer
have it your way big guy
i do have one question
do you even remember what this wars about
gabriel pauses almost thoughtfully
then he smiles
thats hardly the point is it
i guess i never did get the point
how do you do it gabriel
how do you go on and on in this place
i like it here simon
i always have
im so tired
gabriel grasps simons hand
then join us simon
reject the nicene council
we were here first
i cant do it gabriel
i dont even know why anymore but i cant
you know the routine
swallows hard yes
gabriels hand is suddenly on simons face fingers spread claw like
they press into the flesh
until simon starts to bleed
then to burn
katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound of simons screams
screams carried either on the wind or her dreams
asleep sweaty shivering mary suddenly opens her eyes
gabriel releases his grip on simon letting him fall back against the wall afire
his clothes twist and blacken
his skin creeps and pops
his sunglasses melt and fall away revealing two hollow pits beneath
gabriel lifts simons entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face and stares into the hollow pits
and the fires go out
gabriel drops the crackling acrid body onto the floor
impossibly through the sizzling mucus and molten hair it breathes
it gasps in pain
it wont die
i can do this for five months simon
the skies above lighten and smear blue and red
finishes dressing for school picks up her teaching bag and crunches out across the gravel to her pick up
gabriels lizard boots pace back and forth past simons writhing burning body
gabriels more jittery now
losing his patience
he bends down and pulls simons face up to his
this is getting boring simon
where is it
where did you put it
the seared skin around simons mouth comes off in gabriels hand
but simon is still even now silent
where is it
he flings simon with a horrible crunch against the wall
im just about out of tricks here
youre a tough one friend
he walks over and places a hand with something like friendship on simons charred shoulder
god loves you simon
and with the other hand gabriel jams his fist into simons chest pulling out a lumpy burned heart
simons mouth springs open and hisses emptily
gabriel slips the heart into his pocket and lets go of simons shoulder
the body instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor
katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through town
pulling into the schools drive she sees parked at the buildings back door a sheriffs patrol car
katherine comes up the stairs of the buildings abandoned floor passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she last saw simon
theres a bad smell in the air
at a turn stands a deputy that looks up as katherine approaches
you may want to skip this maam
katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches down beside
its human shaped but like a shadow
a shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry smoldering ooze
the smell is overpowering
the crouched deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth
to katherine were any of your students up here
katherine pulls up and parks
mary is still in bed droopy eyed and sweating
her grandmother is there and so is an elderly navaho
he stands beside marys side holding above her body a clenched pouch that he passes slowly back and forth
to grandmother how is she
did the doctor come by
he found nothing
but something is in her
something the belagaana doctor cant see
the night people have been around two days now
it is a warning
nods to navaho man so we have called the hand trembler
to find if she must have an enemy ghost way
the old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back and forth across marys body
katherine walks back out toward her pickup
thirty yards away almost invisible in the sage say for the glare of its evil intelligent eyes is a coyote
as she feels its gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder
katherine turns quickly but only barely catches out of the corner of her eye a glimpse of something very large
a huge semi roaring deafeningly past on an empty desert highway kicking up a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one horse gas station and thomas sitting there in his
car checking a map
small townish old adobe and stucco walls cannon on the front lawn every door loudly declaring itself a department social services courts and sheriff
the sheriffs personal office is turn of the century regal with high beam ceilings and rotating fans
nothing seems newer than including the coffee pot the sheriff pours a mugful from
trim with glasses bolo tie and boots he looks like barry goldwater
and to what do i owe the thrill of a visit from a so cal homicide cop
he hands the coffee to thomas sitting in a chair beside his solid oak desk
run of of the mill psycho killer body dismemberment on our end
lovely place los angeles
got a lead i wanted to run down chimney rock way
thought id do the courtesy of telling you first
big of you
youre welcome to put a babysitter on me if you like
the sheriff smiles
son this is the third biggest county in the country not even counting the square mile indian reservation right next door and ive got fewer men than just one of
your little palm tree precincts to cover all of it
fraid the only help youre gonna get from me short of another shoot out at the ok corral is that cup of coffee in your hand
a middle aged secretary enters with a stack of paper
heres the last weeks watch reports
she hands them to the sheriff who passes them on to thomas
he flips through the stack comes up with nothing
the secretary hands another single sheet to the sheriff
bobby just called this in from chimney rock
thomas perks at the towns name
to thomas sent a car up there this morning
teacher complained some vagrant was sleeping in her schoolhouse
the sheriffs brow crinkles in consternation as he reads further
to secretary damn it get bobby on the phone clarice
what the hell is this suppose to be
re report may i
the sheriff hands it to him
glancing at it we pick up words like burned black slick body outline
thomas copies the name of the school down gulps his coffee and shakes the sheriffs hand
thanks for the coffee
as thomas turns to leave small piece of advice lt
dagget that i give free of charge to all visiting big city policemen its wild country up there
always has been always will be
you come across anything that snarls you call me first hear
i never turn down advice sheriff
especially when its free
thomass sedan passing through the vast empty land
a small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the earth
a former miners hotel stone walls and sagging wrought iron
thomas tosses his bag onto the bed opens the balcony door and looks out on the crumbly shale hills the abandoned prospecting shacks and the chuska mountains clouds brewing darkly
across its shattered back
a close up of the circled newspaper obituary for general hawthorne
the paper lowers and reveals behind it the generals grave
the dirt around the tomb is loose recently filled
the grave keeper a young gangly drifter type stands nearby with his shovel
how long ago was he buried
what do you mean
somebody dug him up last night
i just finished putting him back
did they take anything
nothin on the outside
thomass breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated abandoned part of the building
rats scurry away from feeding on the dark human like stain on the floor as thomas crouches down beside it
he probes the dried black crusty flotsam with his ball point pen
just like the burned body back at the morgue
far away you can hear the sounds of children
of a teachers voice
its only past the final door into the smallest corner of the building that the walls become clean and brightly painted by eager third graders
the creepy silence transforms itself into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom door and whoop themselves outside for recess
the last one out is katherine
shes surprised to see thomas
suspicious can i help you with something
im with the police
about the guy upstairs
id like to ask you a few questions
ive kinda got my hands full right now
ill just tag along
katherine unlocks a hall cabinet and pulls out a stack of volleyballs
she tosses two to thomas
here make yourself useful
arms full she pushes the building door open with her shoulder and backs out into the sunshine
she tosses the balls out to the kids
okay everbody stays on the courts today
kids groan i mean it
she sits down beside thomas on the buildings stone steps
what grade is this
all of em
town doesnt look that small
nearly all ghosts now
when the copper mine closed it took most of the town with it
we just teach out of this one corner of the schoolhouse now
rest of its been abandoned for years
youre the only teacher
to kid threatening another randy
but he do it again and ill put your head in the door and slam it
to thomas love and understanding are important tools in education
the children skitter back and forth playing
the man upstairs did you talk to him
i wanted to know what the hell he was doing there
what did he say
that it wasnt part of the plan
he looked hurt
like someone had cut him
that happens here
beat was that
on the floor really him
did any of the children talk to him
protective shes home sick from school today
can i speak with her parents
she lives with her grandmother
ill have to ask her
stands hands her slip of paper this is my number at the hotel
thomas starts away
did you know arnold hawthorne
saw him here and there
its a small town
about a million years ago
his interests lately were more like gardening and herbal tea
did you go to the funeral
he lived here
no dark hidden secrets
there are no secrets in small towns mr
dagget dark or otherwise
up the crumbly embankment sitting perched on the roof of an abandoned house is gabriel
he watches thomas walk to his car
he watches the children playing lifting his nose to snort the air like a coyote
thomas sifts through some clippings on general hawthrone
the man who saved korea
almost court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery
a truly ruthless man who spent the last twenty years quietly tending his garden in a dying town
small simple and woodplanked
the church we saw at the beginning
thomas sits there staring at the candles the altar the crucifix
hes alone there
but for a creeping buzz
a feeling in the air
its unusual to see someone of your age in church on a weekday
thomas turns in surprise
gabriel is kneeling in the row behind inches from his ear
dont get me wrong
i think its an excellent sign of character
theres something cold and creepy about gabriel
out of place in here
theres another sound
teeth chattering far in the back
thomas turns and sees jerry deep in the shadows of the choir box
never mind him
he shouldnt even be in here
least not standing
like at the skid row flophouse
youre not from here
either are you
im looking for something
have you found it
have you found what youre looking for
appraising him i dont doubt it
stands youll let me know
when you find it
where are you staying
and he walks out leaving thomas alone in a place gone suddenly cold
theres a note waiting for him at the front desk her name is mary tsosie
you can talk to her at noon tomorrow
ill be at the vfw hall tonight katherine
thomas sticks his head in through the door
its an indian bingo game
thomas eyes drift down the table packed with elderly faces and find katherine and john the navaho bus driver
katherine waves him over
both her and john are totally obsessed with the game keeping track of several cards
i got your note
have a seat
you need a card
here play one of mine
no its okay
really you must learn to shed your high strung ways pale face
you must learn the spirit joy in patience peace and making fifty or sixty bucks
john this is mr
says hes with the police though judging by his coat and basic command of the english language i dont think its from anywhere around here
shakes johns hand tom
from los angeles
that near oxnard
long way from home tom from los angeles
thomas lazily glances at his card his eyes opening suddenly wide
no way recount
a navaho social in full swing square dancing
the indian band on stage plays deeply traditional inspiring hank williams
john easily whirls katherine around a steely eyed master square dancer
thomas leans against the wall tugging on a beer
when john releases her for another partner she points at thomas
oh no thanks
cmon dont be a drip
she leads him out onto the floor
im not very good at this
as they dance no youre not are you
gets a smile out of him
let me lead
couples drift off the buildings porch and into the street to cool off smoke and take a few hits off paper bags
john leans against the brick wall tugs liberally from his paper bag and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the street
he passes the bag to katherine and thomas
so hows our star pupil feeling today
the school doctor came by
declared it non specific gastrointestinal disorder
latin for i dont have the slightest fucking idea
will she be able to talk with me
thats up to her
to john marys grandmother called a hand trembler
hocus pocus time
is that serious
depends what the hand trembler says
people call them in when they think a witch or a yei is trying to sprinkle corpse sickness in their hogan or if the night people have been hanging around
night people screw around a lot but theyre good at warning of evil ghosts
who are the night people
they come as coyotes
thomas sits in the trucks bed as they katherine drives through town
john on the near side of royally toasted has his boot stuck out the passenger window
thomas looks up at the night sky
at its blaze of stars
beautiful stars out here
john drinks again from his bottle rests his head on the open window and looks out
too much fucking sky in the desert
it pushes on you
sighs sometimes i wonder if anyone in heaven even knows this place is here
early american bachelor
john collapses onto the couch as katherine heads for the kitchen
where do you keep the coffee in this joint
above the stove
she messes with the grounds and filter
thomas paces the room looks over the pictures and a few weavings
what happens if the hand trembler says a ghost has been
messing with mary
if youre smart you say thank you very much and forget about it
but if youre heavy traditional and marys people are serious traditional you have an enemy ghost way
its a sing to purify and drive off the corpse sickness
two days of dancing and ceremony and feeding the whole damn village
not even to mention hiring the yataallii if you can even find one these days
and you can bet they dont come cheap
but every clan does it a bit different
you know them
the bitter sky clan
hard core reservation
no lights no running water no hbo
their village is out on the edge of old woman butte
million miles from anything
settled right there in the dead people land where no one else would right on top of the old anasazi village
theyre a dying clan
just the old ones now
all alone out there in the middle of nothing
drinks they can keep it
do people really still believe in it all
ghosts sings corpse sickness
depends i guess
sometimes you go along because its a village thing or you dont want to disappoint grandma
but sometimes when youre alone out there far from town and the wind kicks up and sneaks into your hogan
i dont know
john closes his eyes and drifts off
thomas wanders into the kitchen
i think johns out for the evening
saturday night in chimney rock
she hands him a mug of coffee
so how does a person like you end up teaching here
when i was younger i used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life one day if you listened hard enough a voice would tell
you what you were really cut out to do
and when it didnt show up on schedule i decided to go look for it
and i looked in a lot of places believe me
i drove that road out there so far that the end became the beginning again
and it was when i got here that i realized there never was going to be a voice
so i stopped looking and took the first job they offered me
that make any sense to you
oh i know all about voices
problem is not all of them are very nice
how did you end up a cop
it was the evil of two lessers
are you always this cryptic
when you get to know me i can be down right evasive
katherine pulls up to drop thomas off
thanks for the lift
tomorrow at noon
at the little girls house
first trailer on the highway past town
thomas climbs out
i must say mr
dagget that you dont seem very like a police officer to me
thats what my bosses keep saying
i meant it as a compliment
goodnight miss henley
goodnight tom from los angeles
thomas lying in his hotel bed flinching through a dream filled sleep
theres glimpses of shattered images war
and a small dark haired girl
thomass eyes open and fix on the ceiling
out his window perched on the railing of his balcony is something dark and winged
the honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish quiet streets of the town
across shale hills and abandoned th century miners shacks there echoes the faint clear notes of a trumpet
the bluesy notes drift over narrow dead end streets junked cars and the abandoned copper mine out past the end of town
deep in the tunneled rock past the rusting conveyor belts gabriel sits in a small cave blowing miles davis on his trumpet
theres just the blanket he sits on and a single candle
jerry comes around the corner
get any sleep
jerry only stares just kidding
as katherine climbs out of her pick up she sees several of her students standing in a circle
crouched in the center talking to them is a man
jerry stands nearby
gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet
demonstrating where to put his fingers
there and there
now pucker your lips
aim it that way and just blow a little bit this is a special trumpet
the boy puffs lightly
the trumpet emits a piercing clear note that shatters a window high up in the abandoned part of the building
the youngsters whoop and applaud
very good timmy
here have a junior mint on me
as timmy opens his mouth we clearly see gabriel looking down into it
looking for something
katherine approaches the scene warily
the children all beg for their turn
gabriel selects sandra one of marys second grade friends and puts her on his knee
and who are you
she can barely get her fingers around the trumpet
and did you see the man upstairs sandra
did you talk to him
and who did sandra
who talked to the man
and where is mary sandra
she isnt here
youve got very pretty teeth sandra
here let me see
he gently pushes down her chin with his thumb opens her mouth and gazes in
katherine enters the circle
what the hell do you think youre doing
gabriel looks up unperturbed and smiles
just talking to the kids maam
get off his knee sandra
everyone else go inside
the kids reluctantly shuffle off
see ya kids
be sure to study your math
he has the same sunglasses as simon
the same cold creepy air about him
who are you
its a long story
jerry suddenly snorts loudly trying to retrieve a sticky red glop that starts running out of his nose
everyone else does
i dont know what the hell is going on but you both better get out of here
he climbs to his feet and stands close to her
you have no idea whats going on
he stands there a beat
that terrible coldness that swirls about him
the shriek of ghosts under his breath
then he climbs into the rambler with jerry and pulls away
katherine watches the car drive off then yells over to the school janitor
keep an eye on the children for me
ill be right back
and call the sheriff
what the hell do i tell him
katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine
katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe of town
as she passes the old copper mine she sees parked near the mines tunnel entrance gabriels rambler
as katherine pulls up shes surprised to see thomas climbing out of his own car
you werent suppose to be here till noon
youre a little early yourself
i wanted to check on her
that makes two of us
on the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a wizened cottonwood tree
katherine thomas and mary are seated beneath its shade
katherine is protective of the little girl running a hand maternally through her hair
how are you feeling pumpkin
this is mr
hed like to ask you some questions
you dont have to answer if you dont want to
theres a dreamy far away look in marys eyes
it worries katherine
mary when you talked to man up in the building simon
what did simon say
smiles thats funny
like the game
im good at it
im very clever
well have to play together sometime
simon even said so
he also asked if i could keep a secret
and what was that
something he gave me
then it wouldnt be a secret
youre a good friend not to tell mary
but im a friend of simons too
so if you ever want to tell you can to me
its a secret
mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes
but sometimes it hurts
thomas and katherine exchange looks
marys pretty eyes rise again as she calmly asks in that cute little eight year old voice have you ever killed a chinaman
no mary i havent
they dont bleed
not the way you and i do
or maybe it was just the cold
thomas looks to katherine for an explanation but shes as confused as him
ive killed them you know
you could always tell when they were coming
thered be the trumpets first
every note flat
then those songs
after that theyd charge
right down through the snow
the guns would freeze and it would be just knives
it was so cold and there were so many of them
but i was smarter than they were
even at chosin i was smarter
marys been explaining this in a girlish show n tell kind of way
suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a sob
it scares me miss henley
i hate it
please make it stop
she buries herself into katherines arms sobbing
make it stop
rocking her its okay
mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer into the arms of her grandmother
im sorry i didnt mean to its all right miss henley
we know you love mary
what are we going to do
shes going to have the enemy ghost way
we leave this afternoon
the grandmother turns and walks back to the trailer
where will they do the ceremony
in the home village
the hand trembler must have found corpse sickness
theyre taking her away
shouldnt she see a doctor
shes already seen a doctor
then under her breath that son of a bitch
gabriel the children called him
the little shit was hanging around my kids this morning asking about mary
he and his buddy make a real pair
maybe its time i checked out mr
katherine turns from trailer and looks at him
i know where he parks his car
katherine and thomas drive back down the road leading to town
ive never heard her talk like that before
chosin reservoir was a korean war battle the marines had against the chinese supposedly the bloodiest hand to hand fighting of the century
someone been teaching that to your class
sure right next to jack n jill
where would she have heard it
nobody i can think of
beat maybe one
did she know him
he didnt like children
you couldnt and tell a story like that to one
he pulls over to the side near the copper mine entrance
no sign of the rambler
it was there earlier
thomas drives up the dirt path to the mines tunnel entrance
they climb out and stand near its mouth
in the dust is the ramblers tracks and several footprints leading into the mine
thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel
its a black yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast
if i was smart id call the sheriff or somebody in town who knows this place
then again there is one thing worse than getting killed
looking like an idiot if its nothing
he pops his trunk and takes out a flashlight
ill come along
no if someone has to fall a hundred feet down a black pit he should at least be on official duty
thomas switches on the light and takes a tentative step inside
then again it is kind of spooky in there
here you can hold the flashlight
the sun very quickly becomes a memory
and after the first bend it isnt even that anymore
theres only the glow of the flashlight glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled rock
here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry dented ore carts lying on their side rusted drill bits piles of support timbers
and all around them the sucking blackness of the earth
they walk further down into the mine
the atmosphere becomes close and creepy
thomas has been following tracks left in the dusty floor that abruptly disappear
he stops and sighs
a bat suddenly shrieks out of the darkness glancing off thomass shoulder and tangling in katherines hair
she screams and spins around loosing her footing and half falling into a yawning ore chute she hadnt seen beside her
thomas rushes over and pulls her out
she climbs shakily to her feet
thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his flashlight
well ive seen enough
as he turns to leave the flashlight burns out
he bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the first time a dim amber light coming from a space between the rocks
what is that
i dont know
maybe a bum or something
but his guns out at his side
just in case
they follow the light to the gap in the rock gingerly stepping into that could easily belong to a bum
its gabriel and jerrys digs
just the moldy blanket single oil lamp piles of twinkie wrappers and something else
from outside the cave its the same whine the same blurryness that drips off gabriel like sweat
but once they step into the room into the lair it suddenly jumps in volume
this is where gabriel sleeps and its thicker here like honey on the walls
thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes
do you feel it
what is it
but thomas cant hear katherine anymore her voice has disappeared beneath the whine
as it becomes too much he leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes
its then they come
flashes of images of screams and fire
of impossible vistas of emptiness and death
and shrieking overhead shrieking everywhere grotesque winged creatures with no eyes
some with faces we know gabriel simon and the gargoyle
all these images are being jammed into both their minds by the cave
thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around him wont go away
tears are running down katherines face as she stands there locked in the same images
thomas stumbles about the room as if drunk the visions incomprehendibly black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau eat his brain
he sinks to his knees and begins to cry
oh god no
katherines curled up on the floor like a child weeping
the images are driving them mad
thomas fighting the insanity pounding at him crawls pathetically across the floor to the oil lamp
his fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to his knees and leans back
he heaves the lamp against the cave wall where it explodes the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that consumes the corner
the images break a second in the heat and light and sucking wind
just long enough for thomas to grab katherines arm and pull her out of the room
katherine and thomas lie in the dust outside the mines tunnel entrance
catching their breath
trying to organize and repair the short circuits in their brains
thomas rolls on his side squints at the sun
katherines voice is faint and raspy
what was that
they were screaming and fighting over
they dont sweat much about that in hell
but they do in
he squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands
the son of a bitch
he carries it around with him like a photo album
a big greasy cloud wherever he goes
they all do
how can that be heaven
i dont even believe in heaven
the tears start rolling down her face
she looks up and shouts at the endless sky above them
you dumb fucking assholes
how could you have done that
that extra chapter by st
john was right
its a war
just like the first one
just like when the angel michael beat lucifer and cast him out
only now theyve turned on each other
turned on each other in a civil war over theology
he laughs hopelessly at the insanity of it all
oh sweet god theology
sighs gods wild bunch
shouts gods morons
how do you know know so much about that
i just know
shakes his head yes folks the good news is that theres life after death in heaven
the bad news is that its as screwed up as here
they were like us
they are us
and they need us
they need our corrupt dark souls for their fight
katherine climbs abruptly to her feet and walks for the car
what are you doing
i dont know what this is
i dont know what i believe
i dont know if my sanity is lying back in that cave flopping around waiting for me
but i know one thing
those things arent taking her
katherine and thomas drive along in silence
finally in those
did you ever see
katherine and thomas open the trailer door and enter cautiously
thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time parked behind the trailer gabriels rambler
he immediately pulls out his pistol runs for the closed door at the end of the hall and kicks it in
the door flies open revealing gabriel sitting on the bed beside mary
get away from her
his guns leveled at gabriels head
the angel sits there impassively then smiles
son of a bitch the priest wanna be actually figured it out
thats a rare club son
at least down here
back away from the kid man
she wont feel anything honest
ill have to tear her apart of course just the way it goes but itll be all right in the end
a good catholic boy like you mr
daggett you should be on my side
goddamn it youre gonna have to watch that profanity
jerry suddenly leaps out from behind the door and tackles thomas to the carpet
the gun skitters to one side as jerry sinks his rotting teeth into thomass shoulder
thomas cries out and slams his fist against jerrys head knocking off an ear
gabriel turns back to marys frightened face and smiles as he runs a hand through her hair
itll only be a moment
katherine suddenly hammers gabriel across the side of the head with a chair knocking him to the floor
as he gets up she hits him again
thomas manages to bring his leg up and kicks jerry hard against the chest forcing him off
gabriel grabs both of katherines legs and pulls crashing her flat on her back
thomas scrambles for his gun grabs it and as jerry comes at him again spins and fires twice
the slugs rip into jerrys chest and knock him to his knees
as the putrid curdled juices pump lumpily out of him jerry looks up at thomas and smiles
thanks man i appreciate it
youre a sport
thomas fires a slug into his forehead
jerrys brain winks out as he collapses to the floor dead
thomass gun is abruptly wrenched from his hand onto the bed as gabriel nails him with a thrown lamp vaults the bed between them and grabs him by the collar
slamming thomas up against the wall
he looks down at jerrys finally lifeless corpse incensed at thomass handiwork
you little pest do you have any idea how hard it is to get one of those
he throws thomas down onto a table splintering it
katherine climbs shakily to her knees
you son of a bitch why
why do this
because im an angel you miserable wretch
i kill first borns while their mothers watch
i turn whole cities into salt
i even when i feel like it rip the souls from little girls
and from now until eternity the only thing youll be able to count on in your pathetic little existence is never knowing why
deep breath im wasting my time here
turns to mary cmon petunia lets get on with it
gabriel walks over to the bed
the moment he gets close mary lifts thomass pistol up from the sheets and shoots him twice the impact knocking him on his ass
katherine rushes to mary scoops her up and runs for the door
she pauses beside thomas still lying in the wreckage of the table
katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway
gabriel spins around and stands
thomas leaps from a ragged crouch hitting gabriel low with a body block
its like butting concrete
gabriel picks up thomas by the scruff of the neck and heaves him through the flimsy room paneling
thomas crashes with a mass of splinters into the kitchen
he stumbles backward hopelessly as gabriel peruses him through the trailer
he desperately throws pots glasses anything at gabriel
finally trapped he scrambles up onto the dinner table scattering salt and sugar bowls and dives through the levored window
thomas in a hail of shattered glass smacks the red earth pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl away as gabriel bangs open the trailer
door and stomps down the stairs toward katherine her arms around mary
he eases his gait measuring the distance to her
theres just those sunglasses coming
those endless pits of black
katherine lifts thomass pistol and fires
the slugs bang off the corregated metal smash a window kick up some dust and puncture the propane tank beneath the trailer
the entire trailer explodes in a fiery cloud of twisting katherine huddles mary close to the ground as flaming chunks whack everywhere
gabriel is hammered to the earth and disappears in the rolling fire cloud
thomas further away is knocked head over heels in the ruddy dust
the fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky leaving behind scorched brush and little else crackling softly
gabriels body looks blackened and still
katherine rushes to thomas whos pulled himself up to his knees a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly
she helps him to his feet and over to the pickup where he sits down against the tire as katherine pulls out her first aid kit
marys there standing with her shaken grandmother
re grandmother where
she was coming up the street
is gabriel dead
marys knelt down beside thomas
theyre not like you and me
youve got to cut their hearts out
the only thing god gave them
a sheriff car roars up the two deputies exiting warily
what the hell happened here
katherines wiping the blood out of thomass eye
gasping from the shearing pain he tosses an id at the foot of the deputy
looks at it hands it to partner thats a start
how about the rest of it
from somewhere back in town theres the growl of a volunteer fire engine
that man over there
im taking him in
the pains unbareable
katherine dabs his cut with disinfectant
i think youre going to the hospital first
no i have to again the pain
the second deputy has walked over to gabriel
is he alive
well take him to the hospital in our car
no you dont understand
you have to let me have him the volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds drowning out thomass words
two firemen kneel down beside him with medical kits
the deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are dragging back between them a cuffed comatose gabriel
hoarse faint youll never hold him
thomas tries to get up but the pain and a hand from the firemen keep him down
as the deputies pass he manages to desperately grab the ones pant cuff
take off his sunglasses
jesus christ just take off his sunglasses
gabriels head lies low between the shoulders
the deputy looks with concern at the firemen
re thomas hell be all right
just a bad hit
the deputy nods
as they carry on to the car with gabriel the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only for thomas
to partner lets get a splint
the patrol car pulls away
as the firemen walk back to their engine thomas looks frantically at katherine
we have to get out of here
but your head
if you want mary to stay alive past sundown we have to leave and we have to do it now
they lock eyes
then katherine without a word helps thomas up into the passenger side of the pickup
mary gathers her grandmother into the pickups bed and climbs up beside her as katherine starts the engine
the firemen turn in confusion as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road
katherines truck shoots by
just before town near the copper mine it slows down at a junction
and there lying on its side down the embankment is the sheriffs patrol car
a single bent tire turns aimlessly
katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads away from town out onto the endless expanse of the plateau
the bandage on thomass forehead covers most of one eye
he closes the other tightly riding a spasm of pain before letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing out at the empty tracks of land
where are we going
katherine looks over her shoulder to marys grandmother sitting in the truck bed
she nods in understanding
katherines pickup passing alone through the wrinkled desert
a trading post with a few pumps growing orange in the weakening afternoon light
a scruffy dog barks constantly as the teenage indian sticks the nozzle in katherines pickup
still glassy eyed with throbbing pain thomas takes another handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab
theres a tiny weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it
thomas crunches across the lot picks up the receiver and punches in some numbers
county coroners office assistant coroner raphael speaking
you werent crazy man
and thomas hangs up
he backs away from the phone and for the first time notices the church its attached to
thomas steps inside
its empty and theres some doubt whether its been used in a generation
the pews are dusty and scraped some broken down completely
thomas sits in one and looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix hanging behind the altar
so whats the deal huh
the pew creaks and groans as he shifts his weight
i mean do you have any kind of plan here
cause im just about of ideas friend
jesus pressed metal eyes gaze only upward
do you even listen
do you still come to places like this
old man you have been calling me most of my goddamn life but every time i get close you just keep moving that far away
whats it to be
you want me to kill your henchmen
cant you even control your own killers anymore
thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment
when it raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts what do you want from me
the only reply is dust dancing in the light and the rumble of semis on the highway
standing in the back watching thomas with tears welling in her eyes is katherine
the roads turned to dirt and the plateau into a maze of ragged cliffs and brutally hacked canyons
the light is shadowy and golden now as katherines pickup turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic
higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and treacherous path till at last it crests the ridge and comes upon perched frighteningly on the leading edge of old
woman butte this is the home of the bitter sky clan
the village is a small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a thousand years ago by the anasazi
theres no electricity here no tv antennas or frozen yogurt
just the slow curl of cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern deeply lined face of an old navaho man approaching the pickup as katherine stops
the old man wears jeans a bright maroon silk shirt and a black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather
he holds in his right hand a small leather case
i am bartholomew grey horse born to the deer spring clan born for the slow talking people
today i am the yataalii for mary tsosie of the bitter sky clan
the old man bartholomew grey horse walks up to mary and her grandmother sitting in the bed
ya tah hey
several villagers approach and greet mary and her grandmother some nodding politely to thomas and katherine as they climb out of the cab
nearly all of them are elderly
thomas one eye still half shut by a bandage walks over to the villages edge where a short stone wall and little else separates the adobe homes from the long
foot drop to the desert floor
he leans against it and gazes out on a view that must encompass half the world
in all directions for tens upon tens of miles there are only volcanic spires and crumbling buttes all reduced from up here to short ominous playthings
a village truly alone in the world
this is a good place
shes appeared beside him
thomas crouches down to her level and smiles
marys sight is on the view eyeing it critically
separate water source
only one possible approach
a man could with the proper defenses hold off an entire battalion for weeks
thomass voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through her hair
which one of you is that talking mary
or do you even know anymore
marys eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and leads her back to the adobe hogans
grey horse the yataalii is there now
we will start the sing soon to remove the yei spirit and stop the ghost sickness
this might not be the work of a navaho ghost
its all the same
night creeps over the chuska mountains across the crusty caliche flats and over the village pushing back the dying day to a thin fading blue line etched across the horizon
as the darkness settles on the hogans we see a glimmer of light from within and the rising guttural chants of the yataalii
under the village beneath the surface of the butte is the large communal kiva room
accessible by a single ladder through a single smoke hole it is down here that the village performs its enemy ghost way for mary
the little girl is there attended by her grandmother sitting stoically still on a blanket as grey horse grasping his painted prayer sticks by the glow of a fire chants
the enemy ghost way cure
katherines eyes sting in the smokey air as she watches grey horse take from his case small handfulls of colored sand that he pours in fine patterns onto the floor
the whole bitter sky clan surrounds them
old lined faces
a small dying people here to support its last granddaughter
katherine stands there in the chilly darkness outside the kiva
marys grandmother passing with some other women pauses and squeezes katherines arm
now we sleep katherine
tomorrow after dark we begin again
the fire has died to embers casting its weak glow on a now empty room
katherine wanders along the edge of the village turning up her collar under a blinding mass of stars
theres nothing beyond the village
not a light not a sound
say the wind
it is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers
like the wind it is low and thin and hoarse
like the wind it seems to come from everywhere
and like the wind it is utterly without pity or remorse
perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure clad entirely in layers of black
its head and hands are hairless and waxy white
there are eyes in this winged head but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow
there are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles but mostly only there are the eyes
katherine gulps down with only partial success the hysteria rising in her throat
oh lord i cant do this
i cant do this anymore
we must talk katherine
its takes all her strength to look upon him
tries to form the word god
god is love katherine
the eyes narrow
rippling pools of unfathomable evil
i dont love you
theres a crouched silhouette beside the figure
a wheezing sycophant
katherine backs away from both of them
i cant do this tonight
i can kill you katherine
i can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mothers feces
or i can talk with you
i am here before you in a form to put you at ease
the sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under its cloak
i rarely do this in person
i am perhaps somewhat out of touch
are you one of them
youre not an angel
oh i am an angel
a very special one
the naive eagle scout he once loved me above all others and i him
it was the only true love for either of us but like all true love it couldnt possibly last
the figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them
the movement makes a liquid snapping sound
the winged party boys will come katherine
theyll come to feed on the guts of your little mary
what do you care
i have my interests
he turns back to her
the naive eagle scout he has his interests too
he even has a place for them as i do for mine
big shiny place
youd like it
only its been empty for a long time
cant open till after the resurrection
the problems with the hired help
always had problems with the hired help
theyre arrogant boastful little pricks
not like me
what i did i did for love
but they the winged party boys even before the park could open for its first customer they started fighting over the popcorn stand
the figure shifts his perch on the wall
you see katherine heaven cant start accepting guests till this fight is settled
and without people there is no heaven
all those good and true souls left mouldering in the ground clutching their h tickets and waiting and waiting and waiting
some lying down there with the worms century after century they start to get doubts about the whole program
thats when out of sheer boredom some of them come to me
because im always open for business
hours a day seven days a week
even on christmas
the figures face darkens
some of the angels cheat
they sneak a few souls in to help with the fight
the really dark ones
and now one of them has found a special soul so wonderfully sick that it might just win it for them
and if one side wins even the wrong one then theres no fight
and if theres no fight there can be a heaven
and if theres a heaven
id be very unhappy
beat i am here to help you and the little bitch not because i love you not because i care about you but because i want this war to go
on and on and on
the figure straightens up stretching its spine
i bring you the chance to save your mary katherine
and along the way stop the resurrection
listen when i speak
now go to bed katherine
tomorrow i promise you is a big day
thomass sitting on the hard packed floor leaning against the adobe wall maybe trying to sleep
mostly trying to ignore the thumping pain in his head
the oil lamps flame shudders in the gust of katherine opening the door
is it over
they start again tomorrow
and at the end of it
the enemy way chant removes the invading yei ghost
will it work on a generals soul
beat hows the head
she sits down on the floor beside him
here ill change the bandage
she carefully unwraps the blood soaked gauze
does that hurt
then i must be doing it wrong
she peels back the compress and dabs the wound
i saw the devil tonight
the main one
the dark angel
what did he have to say
that he did it all for love
that and i have a choice
marys life or a billion souls waiting in the pipeline for heavenland to open
youre not kidding are you
you had to be there
thomas suddenly slams his fist against the wall in anger
why wasnt i
we can double date next time if its that important to you
you dont understand ive spent my whole life
looks upward i dont suppose it would occur to anyone in authority to fill me in on whats going on every once in awhile huh
the ache in his heads flared up
he leans it back against the wall to ease the pain
did he say anything about the nicene council
about the rank of jesus christ in the holy trinity
it didnt seem important to him
katherine finishes taping the new bandage
are you a priest
a near miss
its a long story
this may be your last chance to tell it
a wind outside rustles through the hogans
the other night you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something
well let me tell you the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something
since i can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the church called me
so loud and so often that by thirteen i knew i was going to be a priest
you know what thats like
my parents friends all of them thought i was crazy
but see i had this voice
the voice that kept coaxing me along telling me there was a reason
so i entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother father and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash
he pauses the old emotions creeping back up on him
i had never asked anything of the voice
not when the neighborhood kids made fun of me not when my father looked down at me like some knock kneed faggot
i never questioned a damn thing
but on the morning i spent looking down at three parallel graves i asked it one question
why were these people taken from me
and the voice that same voice that would wrench me out of my sleep some nights with its jabbering it was suddenly stone silent
it was the only question i ever asked of it and it just left me hanging in the fucking wind
he blinks back the tears welling in his eye
so after that i traded in priest school for homicide school
because if god wouldnt talk to me the devil sure as hell would and his ways were a lot easier to understand
weve never seen god have we
not in any of this
yeah hes certainly a shy son of a bitch ill give him that
maybe were not supposed to
maybe thats faith
do you still have faith in anything katherine
i have faith in mary
and that im going to save that little girl from those creeping things out there
from all of them
maybe you were called to something after all
maybe we both were
the oil lamp wanes and fades
katherine lays her head on thomass shoulder and as darkness swallows them he holds her
they hold each other
john the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep
the night breeze through the window and maybe something else tickles his nose
his eyes open blink turn left right then up and see gabriel perched on the headboard staring down at him
heavy sleeper john
johns eyes open wide in shock
gabriels skin is blackened and blistered in parts
whole shards of his shirt are missing
john tries to sit up but gabriel forces his head back down with his palm
with the ease of a spider he slides down and beside john
dont dont hurt me man
my wallets in the dresser
dont be such a materialist john
sees empty bourbon bottle on dresser sighs no end to your bad habits
what do you want
a moment of your time
you ought to have that nose looked at man
gabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers where are they john
katherine and mary
where would they go
i dont know
sure you do
i dont know
the school maybe
now youre not even trying john
youre katherines best friend
she tells you everything
im just the driver yknow
gabriel extends a blistered open palm over johns face
i can help you remember john
we see gabriel leaning over john as a sickly yellow glow begins to rise and reflect off the walls
beneath it comes johns worst and deepest screams
gabriel splashing the soot off his face and arms in a small institutional bathroom
he looks at himself in the mirror runs a hand through his hair and walks out the door into at the end of it is the intensive care unit that
institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients wired and tubed and oxygenated lay inconclusively between life and death
theres a nurses station there all health status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from her work at gabriel
can i help you
someones going to die here soon
ill just be a minute
theres no visitors allowed in icu
the timings important
i can smell these things you know
the nurse reaches for the telephone
gabriel takes it away from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face open palmed and whispers go to sleep
the nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor
gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patients chart and flips through them tossing one after another aside as unsuitable
finally settles on one deteriorating critical
satisfied he steps over to one of the beds pulls back the curtain and sits down beside an unconscious middle aged woman
he watches patiently listening the beeping scrawl of the ekg above her
it was weak to begin with but now its faltering badly becoming the unsynched etchings of a child
a beeping alarm has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing
at the last possible moment gabriel places his fingers across her face whispering to her coaxing her
whoa not just yet
come on back
the ekgs still flat but the woman is breathing
she begins to choke to cough then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes
she looks in disbelief around her finally settling on gabriels grin
a look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as she begins to cry
hey cmon dont start
looks at chart rachael
hands her kleenex its only for a short time
the sun cresting the lukachukais and warming with honey colored reflection the interior of the hogan
katherines head is still on thomass shoulder the two of them asleep sitting against the wall
katherine opens her eyes and rises stiffly
she looks out the simple window to the glow of morning without expression turns and walks out
marys grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers are attending mary as katherine enters
mary is sitting up in her bed
she smiles at katherine
hi miss henley
grey horse is kneeling near the bed preparing a bowl drink
into it he crushes charcoal dodge weed juniper and ghost plant
this he stirs heats over flame and feeds to mary
she grimaces and leans back in the bed as grey horse says a brief prayer
katherine runs into thomas outside the hogan
hows the head
she accepts a mug blowing a cloud of steam off the top
what are we going to do if he comes
you mean when right
when he comes
theres no phone here
she just looks at him stupid question
beat if we were smart wed leave
get to a town
a sheriff station
marys ceremony isnt over yet
the enemy ghost way
the alien spirit hasnt been driven out
do you really believe in the ceremony
would you have believed in any of this three days ago
nods so we stay and dump the generals soul
you have the gun
with one shot left
the spares sniffs his shirt and a change of clothing are all still at the hotel
sighs were going to have to come up with something
we could always ask him
thomas looks up
shes referring to lucifer whos appeared perched on the edge of the low eye level hogan roof
the sycophant is also nearby chattering its teeth and staring at katherine with jealous rabid eyes
lucifer shivers a claw turning up the collar of his cloak
i always forget how cold it gets in the desert
the swimming bottomless eyes fall on thomas
daggett i presume
hows the faith
thomas cant bring himself to say anything
to form the words
come come must you be so wishy washy about everything
with the absent minded eagle scout i can see that
but youre looking at the devil man say something
can i have some coffee
thomas gingerly hands him the cup
the angel lucifer lifts it and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his mouth drinks
he offers the mug back to thomas for a sip
he finishes it
cranes his neck
i have come to remind you that the winged party boys are just that spoiled boys
you are armed however pathetically with the one thing they never really understood theology
its not much but thats life
is this supposed to be our win one for the ripper speech
dont press your luck mr
and you know instantly in the bottom of your stomach that those eyes mean it
go and get ready thomas
thomas hesitates holds the gaze then turns and leaves
in an instant lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to katherines side
face and eyes and maggot breath uncomfortably close he smiles
have you ever considered katherine that the great absentee landlord the soft eyed eagle scout your childhood prayers are for is just using you
that youre only the exterminator to get rid of his pests
lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau
his mouth presses against her ear and whispers gods junkies are coming katherine
and when they do all hell is going to break loose
a tiny speck on the empty horizon
it grows takes shape and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it wooshes past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway
gabriels at the wheel
beside him grey blonde hair streaming out behind her is rachael recently lifted from the file and forget section of the hospital icu
she tilts her head up
lets the sun warm her pallor
just a sociopathic angel and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top down cruise across a sixty million year old desert
it could happen
a reality bruised waitress madge sets down a coffee and milkshake before gabriel
he downs the shake in one belt
say maam any idea where i can find old woman butte
its on the reservation
i dont suppose you could be just a tad more specific
the waitress eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside in the rambler
isnt your friend hungry
not for a while im afraid
madge has a lot of things she misses in her life but one of them she decides isnt gabriel
take to the sonsela wash cut off
first dirt road go left
twenty twenty five miles youll see it
big black and all alone
gabriel downs the coffee stands and tosses a bill on the counter
i doubt well meet again
thomas drags a heavy chain from katherines truck and begins fastening it to a post
lucifer watches perched on a nearby rooftop
you could always lend a hand
lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that hideous mouth
grey horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as mary is prepared with paint and oils
katherine leans against the doorway nervously watching the horizon
the sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls unceremoniously toward the mountains
a few lanterns have been lit and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants of the navaho enemy ghost way
katherines eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into shadow
there at the end of the earth appears a silent plume of dust
it could be anybodys car but it can only be one car
thomas steps up beside her
thomas sticks his head into the kiva speaks softly to one of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony
is there any way to speed this up
a fire has been built on the kivas floor
through the choking smoke can be seen mary lying on a mat as grey horse chants to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing sand painting
his voice rises and falls in guttural syntax
coaxing the alien spirit out of the child
lock the door
he pulls his head out and hands katherine the pistol
its only one round so make it count
theres a pause and for a moment their eyes lock
she touches his arm almost says something then disappears into the kiva
thomas closes the door behind her
he turns and looks out at the distant plume of dust
radio turned up sophomoric grin glued on his face gabriel roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the butte
the sun has almost completely slipped away now leaving the land a deathly bluish grey
the road flattens out at the top of the butte and gabriel can see the village glowing at the far end
he punches the rambler winding it up for the last stretch and pats the blonde on the knee
youll like this rachael
theres a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as thomas at the last moment pulls up the heavy chain and hooks it over the far post
gabriel does something pointless with the brakes and slams forward into it
the whole rear of the car stands up on impact pitching gabriel through the windshield into the dust
thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron bar
the rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where gabriel lies
breathless nice move
thomass feet crunch softly closer
you ought to come work for us
we sneak the odd civilian in now and then you know
youd like it
nobody tells you when to go to bed can eat all the ice cream you want
and you get to kill
all day and all night
just like an angel
thomas doesnt answer
gabriels body looks ravaged as he carefully steps closer and closer
save yourself friend
why go to the wall with the bitch and her rug rat
itll all turn out the same anyway
here or in heaven were still gonna tear the kid apart
im not an angel heaven or hell
im a man you eyeless puke which means i have one thing you never will
and though i may somewhere inside believe in a god i will never never believe in you
a little speechy today arent we
sighs okay pal have it your way
gabriels legs suddenly swing around and smack thomas sprawling him back into the dirt
the iron bar goes flying as gabriel in a flash is on top of him
thomas thrashes but gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest
without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand
this is going to really really hurt
thomass eyes are wild with fear
you your war
gabriels spread fingers lower themselves toward his face
cmon son out with it
make this one count
your wars a lie
running around acting like this is really about whether christ is just the son of god or if he is god
thats not what this is about at all is it
then prove it to me gabriel
i studied three fucking years of theology before i picked up a gun
cmon youre chief goddamn angel im just a little man
prove to me christ is just a son and less than god
i dont have to
because you cant
because this war isnt about some obscure medieval hangup
youre just jealous
try me gabriel
prove to me the temporal nature of the trinity
show me through logic how the son of the word can be separated from the father
fight me with philosophy gabriel
because you and your army are wrong
and you know it
you knew it sixteen centuries ago
we dont have to listen to him
hes just a son
jealous he could love something more than you
hisses shut up
gabriels becoming unglued
if you wanted to know so badly gabriel why didnt you just ask him
why didnt you just ask god
a shudder passes through gabriel
he straightens up and looks down at thomas as emotion racks his body
because he doesnt talk to us anymore
the two stare at one another
then gabriel lost in himself suddenly turns away from thomas and walks into the darkness
for the village
thomas climbs quickly to his feet spins around and is hit full force by a rabid shrieking rachael
her legs lock around his body vise like as her teeth and nails dig into his skin
he cries out and stumbles to the ground
the two grapple furiously in the dust rachels crazed face taking bite after bite out of his shoulder and neck
thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and yanks the fangs off his shoulder
with his other arm he cuffs her hard breaking the grip and rolling her aside
he staggers to his knees and begins to run
shrieking a mad porcelain banshee out of the dusk rachael catches up and tackles him
on the way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is white thunder
gagging and weeping in blank shock he crawls on his hands and knees as rachael opens up his arm from shoulder to elbow with her nails
as the blood tumbles like ribbons rachael jumps onto his back digging her claws into his scalp
its about all one human can take
mad with pain and anger and desperation thomas manages to climb to a shaky crouch rachael still shrieking on his back
throwing all his weight backward he jams her into the short stone wall
the impact snaps her hold and propels her over the wall and two thousand feet down the side of the butte
thomas daggett can only curl up into a ball gulping shallow shuddering breaths
gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and kicks down the plank wood door
no one home
he walks to the second and kicks its door down
marys ceremony is nearing a crescendo
grey horse has donned the colorful mask of the yei god monster slayer as the relatives now join in the guttural chants of the enemy ghost way
through the thick choking smoke of the ceremonial fire we see katherine nervously watching the door
thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back
stumbling every few steps hes beyond pain and into driven numbness
its hopeless though
we know it
gabriel kicks down another door to another empty hogan
theres only one left
as he approaches from within can be heard the muffled sound of chanting
takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again
he reaches out to something metal for support
its katherines pickup
steps up to the kiva door and kicks it
the frame buckles but holds
he steps back a few feet puts all his weight into a turn and kicks again
the door shatters
wood splinters rocket through the smoke as gabriel appears in the doorway
grey horse everyone freezes
relax folks its just a soul
from out of the smoke steps katherine
she fires one round into gabriels side
the archangel is pitched against the kivas wall where he stays a moment before turning to katherine
im getting real tired of you
she stands her ground between him and the child
go to hell
at least get the zip code right
its all the same isnt it
in heaven we believe in love
and what do you love gabriel
once again the shade of doubt holds him up
but its quickly pushed aside for a corrupted grin
hes given up all pretense
cracking your skull
he advances on her
thats all it is for you anymore gabriel isnt it
just the killing and the burning
you dont work for god anymore
you dont fight for love
and hes on her
with his left arm he brutally forces her to her knees as his right hand palm out and fingers splayed clamp themselves over her face
katherines mouth opens in a silent scream as the pain immediate and beyond endurance flows through her body
from somewhere outside theres a sound
katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to smolder around her
we hear the sound once more closer before the entire kiva wall explodes inward as katherines pickup crashes through it
the mangled grill and hood slam into gabriel from the side and smash him to the ground like a broken puppet
katherine falls backward to the floor gets up and runs to the trucks cab
inside sits a near catatonic thomas
katherine takes only a second to share a look with him before reaching back and pulling out the pickups tire iron
gabriel a shattered broken thing pulls himself up to his knees
the sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare out at mary huddled in the corner
bleeding from every pore one arm bent back the wrong way he crawls across the floor toward her his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim
god loves you mary
katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all her might driving him to the floor
she turns to grey horse her eyes wild
he everyone just stare
stunned to stone
grey horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice faltering and cracked in the insane glare of the wrecked pickups headlights resumes the enemy ghost way chant
katherine turns back to gabriel
she hits him again with the tire iron
then lifts it high once more above her head
shes going to crush him to implode his skull
when a hand stops her
sort of a hand
hes standing behind her holding the raised bar still
katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor
lucifer turns to the villagers gazing fearfully at him as they awkwardly try to finish the chant
lucifers gaze falls on a deeply fucked up gabriel who groans at the sight of him
oh man this just isnt my day
lucifer kneels down beside him
katherine instinctively starts to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid chattering warning at her
the worlds young man
and full of ambition
this isnt your war
but i remember the last one
but lots of angels were with me
every one followed their leader out of heaven
yeah yeah i was there remember
oh he was with me all right
he hated the eagle scout
envied the power he gave to his son
but this angel never came out front during the war
and when it ended he thought maybe maybe the eagle scout didnt notice
so he laid low and towed the company line till he could start his own war
it was all just jealousy
but maybe he did notice
maybe thats why im here
stay away from me
youve always been a part of me gabriel
and now its time to come home
lucifer slams gabriels head against the floor and pins it
as the angel thrashes furiously lucifer forces his arm into gabriels chest
gabriel cries out as lucifer pulls his arm half out and forces it deeper
soon gabriels screams become giggles then a crazed hysterical laughter
the room goes insane
an impossible nightmare of chanting navahos glaring headlights and gabriels echoing laughter as lucifer pumps his chest
laughter that rises to a kind of orgasmic cry then instantly stops as lucifer pulls out the angels heart and eats it
at that instant grey horse places his hand on marys forehead speaks a last line and the chant is completed
sticky smoky awful silence
gabriel is a non thing
a battered hollow shell
bartholomew grey horse his voice cracked and finished turns to katherine
the enemy spirit is gone
weak faint where
from outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded savage growl
katherine walks to the doorway
just outside a lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony
abruptly its thrashings cease
the animal stands and flashes for an instant at katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal
then its gone into the blackness
she turns and goes back to thomas in the cab
bleeding to death is a real possibility for him
she pulls an old shirt out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced arm
more will come
to look for the soul
and they wont find it
not in mary
a few of the village elders appear at the cab
can you help him
we have some bandages
katherine walks over to where mary sweaty and shaken sits huddled in a corner attended by grey horse
are you all right pumpkin
marys voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes
katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her
its going to be okay
were all going to be okay
the chattering hissing sycophant grabs gabriels body by the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door
lucifer has remained behind crouched on his haunches his liquid yellow eyes on katherine
i cant quite bring myself to say thank you
then this is done
maybe i like you
maybe i want you to come with me
he rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her
you owe me katherine
and youre going to ask me to take you home
clutching mary no
you will because any other way is going to be more awful than you can imagine
are you threatening me
just a grinning twisted stare
then youve picked the wrong person this time
ive just about had it up to here with ghosts
so you can put away the horror movie sneer and the k mart halloween eyes because we know you now
we know you all
and if you want to force the issue then go ahead because youre just another angel to me
take a look at your buddy gabriel
then ask yourself do you really really want to fuck with us
the smallest hint of a pause
perhaps another time
im holding my breath
and hes gone
through the door and into the night
is he coming back
i dont think so honey
i dont think so
the fullness of day over old woman butte hot and bright
chasing the night and its fears away under the punishing glare of noon
the village is full of police vehicles now
green broncos from the navaho tribal police
blue and white sheriff department sedans
the navaho cops are talking with katherine and mary
thomas is sitting on the trunk of a patrol car getting his wounds properly bandaged as the sheriff we met earlier leans beside him chewing on a wild oat stalk
to deputy bandaging thomas is he going to live
with any luck
to thomas i thought i told you to give me a call if anything snarled
there wasnt a phone
he chews some more on his stalk
looks off at the village
this fella gabriel
pretty violent guy gabriel
even for out here
caught up with him at the village
he caught up with me
what were you doing way up here
enemy ghost way for mary tsosie
the sheriff looks over at katherines pickup still jammed into the side of the kiva
did you kill this gabriel
i think so
dont have any idea where the body is i suppose
well if hes alive he wont get far out there
us or the coyotes itll be the same
beat i rang your office in la
they dont have a warrant out for a gabriel
or anybody else in arizona
i hadnt gotten around to it
sort of an out of pocket thing
the sheriff takes his hat off
runs his finger along the inside band
that woman lying at the bottom of the arroyo the one still in her hospital gown know anything about that
this gabriel was sure one busy dude
yes he was
youll be going back to los angeles now
the sheriff pushes off from the patrol car and tosses aside the oak stalk
dont hurry back
the deputy finishes his bandaging
dont do much but breathe the next few days
and get to a hospital
youre going to need some serious stitches
say hi to hollywood for me
he follows his boss
katherine and mary walk up
you look bad
i feel worse
to katherine re navaho cops they lean on you much
i think they might have even understood
one of thems related to this clan
hell give us a ride back if we want
i think ive about run out of hospitality with the sheriffs department
the moment drifts into silence
do you think its really over
till we die
her eyes settle on his
when i die i want you with me
i want that too
she touches his cheek mary cradled between them
thomas sitting in the back of the tribal police bronco looking out the window to the shimmering sands red and yellow and black
to clouds brewing over faraway forgotten mountains
to the end of the earth
