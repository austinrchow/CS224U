by kevin williamson rewrite july a hand reaches for it bringing the receiver up to the face of casey becker a young girl no more than sixteen
a friendly face with innocent eyes
from phone hello
who is this
who are you trying to reach
what number is this
what number are you trying to reach
i dont know
i think you have the wrong number
take it easy
she hangs up the phone
the camera pulls back to reveal casey in a living room alone
she moves from the living room to the kitchen
its a nice house
the phone rings again
casey grabs the portable
i guess i dialed the wrong number
so why did you dial it again
wait wait dont hang up
casey stands in front of a sliding glass door
its pitch black outside
i want to talk to you for a second
theyve got numbers for that
casey hangs up
a grin on her face
a big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees
it sits alone with no neighbors in sight
the phone rings again
popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove
casey covers it with a lid reaching for the portable phone
why dont you want to talk to me
who is this
you tell me your name ill tell you mine
shaking the popcorn i dont think so
whats that noise
casey smiles playing along innocently
youre making popcorn
i only eat popcorn at the movies
im getting ready to watch a video
just some scary movie
do you like scary movies
whats your favorite scary movie
hes flirting with her
casey moves away from the stove and takes a seat at the kitchen counter directly in front of the glass door
i dont know
you have to have a favorite
casey thinks for second
you know the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters
nightmare on elm street
is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers
freddy thats right
i liked that movie
it was scary
the first one was but the rest sucked
so you gotta boyfriend
you wanna ask me out
do you have a boyfriend
you never told me your name
casey smiles twirling her hair
why do you want to know my name
because i want to know who im looking at
casey spins around like lightning facing the glass door
what did you say
i want to now who im talking to
thats not what you said
what do you think i said
casey clicks on the outside light
a flood light illuminates the backyard
her eyes survey the grounds
but its empty
no ones there
she turns the light out
on the stove the popcorn pops
i have to go now
i thought we were gonna go out
nah i dont think so
dont hang up on me
casey hangs up
she checks the glass door making sure its locked and then moves to the stove as
she slides the popcorn from the stove reaching for the phone
i told you not to hang up on me
what do you want
dial someone else okay
you getting scared
she hangs up
the phone rings again
she grabs it
deadly serious total silence
he has gotten her full attention
is this some kind of a joke
more of a game really
casey eyes the glass doors then looks up the hallway to the front doors
moving to it
she bolts it
im two seconds from calling the police
theyd never make it in time
casey moves her face flush against the door her eye looking through the peephole
a distorted view of the front porch
it is empty
she relaxes a bit relieved
what do you want
pure evil caseys jaw drops as total fear storms her face
she hangs up the phone throwing it down on a side table when
casey leaps out of her skin
she turns to the door as it chimes again
calling out whos there
she moves to it
louder whos there
its time for the police
she goes for the portable phone
just as she picks it up
casey almost drops it losing her breath
she brings it to her ear with trembling hands saying nothing
a long silence
you should never say whos there
dont you watch scary movies
its a death wish
casey clutches the wall nearly collapsing
she tries her damndest to hang tough
look enough is enough
you had your fun now you better leave me alone or else
or else what
close on her face her mind thinking calculating
my boyfriend will be here any second and hell be pissed when i tell him
i thought you didnt have a boyfriend
she holds steady
i do have a boyfriend and hell be here any second and your ass better be gone
i swear it
and hes big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you
im getting scared
im telling you the truth
i lied before
i believe you
so you better leave
his name wouldnt be steve would it
casey buckles at the knees losing it
how do you know his name
go to the back door and turn on the porch light again
casey terrified forces herself to move
staggering to the kitchen
to the glass doors
her shaky hand finds the light switch
she hits it
the back yard is lit
sitting in a lawn chair in the middle of the backyard is a big line backer of a guy her boyfriend
tied and gagged
hes been roughed up but hes alive
close on his eyes
wide in fear
staring at his girlfriend pleading with her
her hand moves to the lock on the door
i wouldnt do that if i were you
terror rides caseys face
where are you
her eyes search the yard combing bushes trees
he could be anywhere anywhere
begging please dont hurt him
that all depends on you
why are you doing this
tears find their way streaming down caseys face
i wanna play a game
then he dies
which is it
a long silence
casey touches the glass
staring at steve
this big jock of a guy is crying too
what kind of game
turn off the light
her hand goes to the switch
steve tugs and pulls at his straps
as if begging her
his face sweat and tears
he disappears in the darkness
casey moves away from the glass back toward the living room unbelieving horrified
heres how we play
i ask a question
if you get it right steve lives
three curtainless windows line one wall
casey crouches down behind the couch tipping a lamp cord from its socket darkening the room
her body quivers
please dont do this
itll be fun
its an easy category
ill even give you a warm up question
dont do this
name the killer in halloween
its you favorite scary movie remember
he had a white mask he stalked the baby sitters
casey goes silent
a nervous wreck
she can barely speak much less think
i dont know
come on yes you do
casey is sobbing
whats his name
i cant think
casey has officially reached hysteria petrified beyond all reality
steves counting on you
a whisper michael
now for the real question
but youre doing so well
please go away
leave us alone
then answer the question
casey is a blubbering wet mass on the floor
name the killer in friday the th
a mad smile purses caseys lips
she knows this
she leaps up through tears screaming
a slight pause
thats the wrong answer
no its not
it was jason
it was jason
i saw that godamned movie twenty times
it was jason
then you should know jasons mother mrs
vorhees was the original killer
jason didnt show up until the sequel
casey is stupefied
you tricked me
lucky for you theres a bonus round
but poor steve
this implication sends casey running to the kitchen
to the glass doors
she flips on the porch lights to see
eyes wide sitting in the lawn chair
his belly gaping open
a mass of blood and ripped flesh
his insides lay on the ground between his feet
a scream erupts from the bottom of her soul as casey collapse on the floor
nearly passing out
close on her face
pale and ghostly white
are you ready
she doesnt answer
a long maddening silence
casey reaches up and clicks off the light making steve go away
leave me alone
answer the question and i will
casey is curled up on the floor like an infant rocking slowly back and forth
what door am i at
there are two doors to your house
a front door and a back one
if you answer correctly you live
from where casey sits she can see both front and back doors
with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize
eyeing both the front door
the back door trying to decide between the two
dont make me
in the darkness casey crawls to the kitchen counter she leans up and grabs a long sharp knife
casey looks around her
she looks down the hall to the front door
then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly
as a lawn chair come flying through it
exploding glass sprays everywhere
this incites casey like fire
she springs to her feet
bolting out of the kitchen as a shadow moves quickly through the shattered doorframe
somewhere in the house back flat against a window listening to feet on cracking glass
she turns and unlocks the latch quietly sliding it up
she can hear him move through the foyer
to the front door
casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window
she holds the knife in one hand the phone in the other
casey eases out the window fumbling dropping the knife back in the house
she starts to reach for it
fuck it she takes off
casey it at the back corner of the house
i can hear you
i know youre here
casey eases along a narrow path between a tall fence and the side of the house
going for the front yard
she must pass the three curtainless windows
she gets to the first one and peeks in
the figure has pulled open the foyer closet searching for her
casey creeps along to the next window she looks in
the figure is completely on the other side of the room moving toward the hall that leads to other parts of the house
she moves further along the house
squeezing by hedges
to the third window
she peeks in to the figure
his face covered with a ghostly white mask inches from her
his eyes piercing through
casey screams bloody murder as a hand
crashes through the glass window grabbing hold of her neck
she beats at him trying to free herself
her nails dig into his arm
she wrenches from side to side
finally breaking free as the hands disappear inside the house
casey sails around the corner of the house eyeing the front door
it remains closed
her eyes cover the sprawling country yard when suddenly
in the distance coming down the road towards the house
she recognizes them instantly
she tears off across the yard toward them
moving like lightning
the car turns into the driveway
casey screams waving madly rushing by a tree as
casey stumbles back catching her balance
the figure moves on her arm poised high
a flash of silver
and casey is struck across the chest
she looks down to see her shirt blossoming red
a look of bewilderment as she drops to one knee
the knife rises again
casey throws her hand forward
the blade comes down
but its blocked by the portable phone still in her hand
she turns staggering to
a middle aged couple emerge from the parked car
they move to the front door completely unaware of whats happening to their daughter only feet from them
casey stumbles forward
her parents ten feet away
she opens her mouth to scream but no sound resonates
she is beyond words
the figure moving behind her
her parents approach the door that fish smelled strong
i told you to send it back
the father discovers the front door ajar
a puzzled look
casey is right behind them with one arm outstretched
if theyd only turn around
they enter the house and close the door as
casey collapses on the ground clutching her bloody chest
the figure upon her
the father sees straight back into the kitchen
the shattered patio door
what is it
calling out casey
in a split second theyre both panic stricken
the father begins searching the house frantically
the mother is hysterical
close on casey
shes dragged by her feet through damp soil
the life going fast from her body
her hand still clutching the phone
back in the house
where is she
call the police
the mother moves to the phone in the foyer picks it up
there is no dial tone
she jiggles the base
where are you honey
call the police goddammit
the phones dead
faintest voice is heard
from phone help me
shes here god i can hear her
wheres my baby
the husband returns to the foyer finding his wife clinging to the phone
where is she
i can hear her
oh mother of god i can hear her
the father upturns the living room
not my daughter
the husband grabs hold of his wife
get in the car and drive down to the mackenzies
the other throws the front door open and rushes out
the father moves through the house when a scream echoes out
that of his wife
he tears off for the front door
the father rushes out the door to find his wife on her knees bent over retching
his eyes move beyond to a tree in the front yard
his stomach fails him
his dinner rises
as he bares witness to the single most horrifying sight hell ever see
that of his only daughter as she hangs from a big oak tree
very much dead
her stomach ripped open
a teenage girls room
neat and pinkish
on the bed amongst age old stuffed animals lie opened school books
the camera pans to a desk against the wall where
a young girl of sits her face glued to the computer monitor in front of her
close on her face
sharp and clever with deep lonely eyes
shes comfortable in a plain flannel nightgown
her hands are at work typing feverishly when suddenly
a noise behind her
she turns abruptly eyeing an open window across the room
a scratching sound
she stands and moves toward it
sidney sticks her head out the window
the late night wind hits her face as a shadow appears just to the left of her a hand reaches out grabs her and suddenly a figure is on top
pulling away from the figure
breaking free falling back onto the floor
its just me
sid looks up to see
a young strapping boy of seventeen
handsome and alluring
a star quarterback class president type of guy
he sports a smile that could last for days
dont hate me
what are you doing here
you sleep in that
billy pulls himself through the window
whispering my dads in the other room
ill only stay a sec
the bedroom door bursts open
the doorknob catches on the open closet door behind it jamming it holding it in place
from behind door whats going on in there
billy quickly rolls out of sight behind the bed
sidney unjams the door to reveal
prescott late s a severe presence
a distracted man nervous and pre occupied
are you okay
can you knock
i heard screaming
no you didnt
im hitting the sack
my flight leaves first thing in the morning
now the expo runs all weekend so i wont be back til sunday
theres cash on the table and ill be staying at the raleigh hilton
out at the airport
so call if you need me
he gives the bedroom a quick once over
i coulda swore i heard screaming
sidney distracts him giving him a peck on the cheek
have a good trip
sleep tight sweetie
he gives her a wink and pulls the door closed
what are you doing here
billy takes a flying leap and lands on the bed
it just occurred to me that ive never snuck through your bedroom window
now that its out of your system
and i was home bored watching television the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you
oh it did
yeah it was edited for tv
all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago we started off kinda hot and heavy a nice solid r rating
on our way to an nc
and how things have changed and lately were just sot of
edited for television
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have little bump bump
i wouldnt dream of breaking your underwear rule
i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff
she snuggles up next to him planting a kiss on his lips
passionate and gentle
he however reacts like a shark moving on top of her his hands everywhere as he presses into her
sidney breaks away
time to go stud bucket
billy sits up
his heart isnt racing
see what you do to me
sweat has popped out all over his forehead his breathing heavy
you know what my dad will do to you
he moves to the window
she follows motioning to his wound
i appreciate the romantic gesture
she gives him a kiss goodnight
sweet and simple
about the sex stuff
im not trying to rush you
i was only half serious
she kisses him again as he eases through the window
would you settle for a pg relationship
she pulls her flannel gown open for a split second
flashing her left breast
his mouth drops open
their eyes meet
they share a smile
get outa here
close on sidney snuggling her pillow sleeping peacefully when
the radio alarm blasts from the night table loud enough to wake the dead
sidney bolts up
from radio found brutally murdered
sidney quick with the reflexes shuts it off instantly
a car trunk slams shut outside
sidney pulls herself out of bed and leans to the window just in time to see her dad jumping in his car
she half waves down at him but he doesnt see her
hes as good as gone pulling out of the driveway and disappearing down the road
a moment as sidney stands at the window staring out after him
the camera pulls back to reveal a picture perfect small town school
old and charming
students come and go moving about
nothing unusual except for the
six police cars four news vans flashing cameras and crowds and crowds of lookie loos gathered just off campus
sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion
four different reporters stand in front of four different cameras giving four different news reports
she moves passed a policeman standing guard
her interest peaked she stops at the first reporter who is
he smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a massive mane of chemically enhanced hair
for the camera the small town of bayboro north carolina was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally butchered
authorities have yet to issue a statement but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again
from behind a finger taps her shoulder
she spins around to see
tatum riley same age feisty carefree
do you believe this shit
they break away from the crowd and head for school
you dont know
casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night
and not just killed sid
were talking splatter movie killed split open end to end
she sits next to me in english
her parents found her hanging from a tree
her insides on the outside
do they know who did it
fucking clueless theyre interrogating the entire school
teachers students staff janitors
they think its school related
they dont know
dewey said this is the worst crime theyve ever seen
even worse than
stopping herself well its bad
theyre bringing in the feds
this is big
sidney looks back at gale her face deeply pained
a frumpy old woman mrs
tate faces her class
her hands clasped together
a tragic look upon her face
a terrible tragedy
an unbearable loss
its days like today we need prayer in school
sidney sits near the rear of the room
the desk in front of her sits vacant
sidney cant take her eyes of it
the door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper
he hand s it to mrs
it appears to be your turn
the room is at capacity
wall to wall with police and the likes
some sit stand lean
sheriff burke a round man in his fifties wipes the stress from his face
whos up next
a young officer looks at the clipboard
this is deputy riley better known as dewey
hes a big guy s handsome in a scrubbed clean boyish way
sheriff burke gestures to bring her in
principal himbry s an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up
she was daughter of
we all know sidney mr
how she doin
shes adjusted well
maintains an a average
you never know she
himbry stops short seeing sidney in the doorway
he rises and seats her
dewey shakes his head seriously
its deputy riley today sid
how is everything
and your dad
hows he doing
well be brief sidney
the police have a few questions theyd like to ask you
sidney eyes them all nervously
students sit at outdoor tables eating lunch
crowded at one table is the gang
this consists of sidney billy and tatum
next to tatum sits her boyfriend stuart with his arm draped across her back
hes a billy wannabe
almost the jock almost handsome almost cool
he tries way to hard
across the table is the fifth wheel randy
a tall and gangly kid with no such billy like aspirations
a witty jokester who elevates geek to coolness
why would they ask if you like to hunt
i dont know they just did
because their bodies were gutted
they didnt ask me if i like to hunt
because theres no way a girl could have killed them
that is so sexist
the killer could easily be female basic instinct
that was an ice pick not exactly the same
yeah casey and steve were completely hollowed out
takes a man to do something like that
or a mans mentality
quiet almost to herself how do you gut someone
all eyes turn to sidney
a serious silence
and then you take a knife and slit from the groin to the sternum
sidney shivers down to her soul
the whole table rolls their eyes at stu
its called tact you fuckrag
remember in jaws when they caught the wrong shark at first and richard dreyfuss cut it open to look foe body parts and all they found was a licence plate
and all this white milky goo
stu leans over and socks randy in the arm
you heard billy shut the fuck up
didnt you use to date casey
stus taken back a little off guard
for about two seconds
before she dumped him foe steve
tatum turns to stu surprised
i thought you dumped her for me
hes full of shit
and are the police aware you dated the victim
offended what are you saying
that i killed her or something
it would certainly improve your high school q
stu was with me last night
before or after he sliced and diced
fuck you nut case
where were you last night
working thank you
i thought blockbuster fired you
i didnt kill anybody
no ones saying you did
besides perfect stu mimic takes a man to do something like that
im gonna gut your ass in a second
to stu did you really put her liver in the mailbox
i hear they found her liver in the mailbox
eyeing sidney randy you goon fuck im eating here
stu nibbles at tatums neck
yeah randy shes getting mad
i think you better liver alone
stu cracks up at his own joke
the others just moan
sidney is about to crawl out of her skin trying hard to ignore it all
a huge two story country home with a spacious lawn
a yellow school bus stops in front of the house and sidney steps off
the house looks big and lonely as sidney moves up the walk to the front door
sidney is on the telephone
into phone you sure i can stay over
my dad wont be back til sunday
through phone no prob
ill pick you up after practice
tell your mom i said thanks
are you okay
uh huh its just
you know the police and reporters
it brings it all back
ill be there by seven
i promise thanks tatum
sidney hangs up
she takes a seat at her computer and boots it up
she sits in front of it staring at the blue screen
her own reflection staring back
sidney comes down the stairs her arms carrying a change of clothes toothbrush make up
she opens the hall closet and pulls a small overnight bag from the top shelf
moving into the living room she loads it up plopping down on the sofa hitting the tv remote
a news reporter fades in
on tv the entire nation was shocked today by the teen murders in north carolina
sidney switches channels
the state bureau of investigation has joined forces with local authorities to help catch what the governor has called the most heinous
the channel switches again
gale weathers appears standing in front of the school
her white teeth gleaming
this is not the first time the small town of bayboro has endured such tragedy
only a year ago maureen prescott wife and mother was found raped and murdered
an old black and white snapshot fills the screen a woman beautiful and familiar
eyes frozen mesmerized by the image
suddenly she clicks the tv off
her eyes go to the clock on the end table
her eyes then move to the framed photo next to it
the same black and white photo stares at her
a healthy vibrant woman
an older version of sidney
sidney curls up on the sofa closing her eyes tight
the clock on the end table reads pm
sidney is fast asleep on the couch
the phone rings
sidney leaps up grabbing the portable phone
from phone practice ran late
im on my way
eyes clock its past seven
casey and steve didnt bite it til way after ten
im not worried
good cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video
i was thinkin tom cruise in all the right moves
you know if you pause it just right you can see his penis
she hangs up the phone
it immediately rings again
into phone tatum
from phone hello sidney
who is this
you tell me
sidney thinks trying to place his voice
it sounds a little distorted
i have no idea
scary night isnt it
with the murders and all its like right out of a horror movie or something
aha randy you gave yourself away
are you calling from work
tatums on her way over
do you like scary movies sidney
i like that thing youre doing with your voice randy
whats your favorite scary movie
you know i dont watch that shit
and why is that
playing along because theyre all the same
its always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who cant act who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door
a brief silence
are you alone in the house
that is so unoriginal
you disappoint me randy
maybe thats because im not randy
so who are you
the question is not who am i
the question is where am i
so where are you
your front porch
this gives her pause
she moves to the window and pulls aside the drapes
why would you call me from my front porch
thats the original part
angle through window
she cant quite see all of the porch
well i call your bluff
sidney goes to the front door
she unlocks the bolt unsnags the chain and pulls the door open
revealing the front porch
she steps out onto it phone still in hand
a single light shines overhead illuminating the porch but little beyond
darkness is all around
so where are you
sidney peers out into the darkness past thick shrubs that grow on either side of the porch
can you see me right now
what am i doing
she sticks her finger up her nose pretending to pick
good try randy
tell tatum to hurry
if you hang up youll die just like your mother
sidney stops dead in her tracks speechless
deadly do you want to die sidney
your mother didnt
his seriousness unnerves her
sid flies off the handle
she hangs up on him
moves back inside the house
locks chains and bolts the door when
rushing her ramming into her side
the phone flies
the figure is on top of her as she goes down
she looks up to see the figure darkly dressed with a pale distorted face white and ghostly
her instincts surface and she kicks up with her foot making the contact with his leg
he topples over
coming right at her his hand finding her neck
suddenly along silver blade appears above her
sidney pulls jerks twists
finally she lifts her torso forward knocking the figure off her
sending him reeling into the living room
wasting no time sidney leaps to her feet
she moves to the front door unlocks it
pulls it open
it catches on the chain
she pushes it closed again looking behind her
the figure has risen knife in hand
sidney pulls on the chain and then inexplicably turns and
runs up the stairs
the figure right behind her
the figure leaps at sidney taking hold of her foot she grabs madly at the wall
her hands grasp a framed painting a quiet country home subdued colors done in oils she rips it from the wall swinging it behind her
it catches the figure head on smashing against his skull sending him backwards tumbling down the stairs
sidney races to her bedroom
she locks the door shut the pulls her closet door open placing the edge right at the door knob just as
ramming it it rips open but the closet door catches it in a crazy vice like hold
sidney grabs the desk phone
off the hook downstairs
the figure rushes the door several times
the frame splinters
but wont give
sidney is at her computer she punches at the keypad madly
the knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly
sidney presses send when it occurs to her all is quiet
the figure is gone
a fearful silence
she looks around
the only sound her own rapid terrified breathing
suddenly a noise at the window
sidney looks up to see
her boyfriend staring at her surprised
i heard screaming
the door was locked
are you okay
hes trying to kill me
billy pulls himself through the window
as he does a small black object falls from his dark jeans
it hits the floor as sidney eyes it
a sleek compact cellular phone
sidney stops in her tracks
their eyes meet
a siren is heard in the distance
billy reaches for her
sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out of the room
sidney nearly falls down the stairs
she rips the chain off the door pulls it open coming face to face with a white ghostly mask
a massive scream erupts from her gut as
to find dewey deputy riley holding it
red lights flash sirens blast vas car after car surrounds the house
sidney falls into the safety of deweys arms
the yard is a whirlwind of activity
an ambulance squad cars cops everywhere
as it smashes against the hood of a police car
his hands are being cuffed his rights being read
screaming i didnt do anything
ask her shell tell ya
dewey holds a car door open as sheriff burke steps out
we got him sheriff
hank loomis kid
hes her boyfriend
they approach billy as hes being placed in a squad car
i didnt do it
please call my dad
the squad car disappears with billy as another car comes to a stop in front of the house
tatum gets out freaked beyond belief
back to the sheriff and dewey as they storm across the yard
i was first to respond
what were you doing out here

how is she

the shit shes gone through
across the yard sits sidney in the back of an ambulance as paramedics check her out
sheriff burke and riley approach

tatum appears barreling past an officer
tatum rushes to her grabbing hold of her

two news vans come driving up the street
the vultures are coming
lets get you out of here
a big white news van comes to a stop in front of the house
the side door slides open and gale weathers hops out just in time to see sidney being escorted to a squad car
ill be damned
jumping from the drivers seat is kenny gales cameraman and flunky
an earnest young chap on the chubby side
the camera hurry
but its too late
sidney is as good as gone
gale sees tatum moving quickly to her car
tatum looks up to see gale weathers rushing her

tatum hops in her car ignoring her
what happened to her

tatums car peels out as kenny comes running up with his camera
whered she go
gale spins around flashing her pearly whites
look kenny i know youre about fifty pounds overweight but when i say hurry please interpret that as
move your gale moves back to the van leaving kenny miffed
a small town station
the bull pen is a little square room with four desks and tonight its hopping
sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water
she wears the sheriffs jacket over her shoulders

sidney stares blankly numb
billy sits opposite sheriff burke

no i didnt
i didnt kill anyone sheriff
were gonna have to keep you billy
the governors got sbi fbi and god knows who else on their way down here
billy fights tears
this is crazy
i didnt do it
sheriff burke eyes him up and down very carefully
tatum has joined sidney
the sheriffs door opens and billy is led out by a coupla uniforms
burke and dewey appear in the door watching tatum comfort sidney
that ghost mask is sold at both krogers and walmart
neither of which keep purchase records
what about the cellular phone bill
theyre pulling loomis account
but itll be morning before we see something
you think he did it
twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance
but these kids today
damn if i know
can we go now
hold up a sec
she staying with you
we havent located her dad yet
dewey turns to her his face red
what did mama tell you
when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law
im sorry deputy dewey boy but were ready to go
use the back way
avoid the circus
the door opens and sidney tatum dewey and a coupla officers exit avoiding the horde of reporters that can be seen around the corner waiting anxiously at the front entrance
ill get the car
dewey takes off
from the darkness of the alley gale weathers appears with kenny and his camera
theyve been waiting
sidney spins around to see gale standing smiling at her
sidneys body tightens and her face goes taut
are you alright
their eyes meet in cold familiar stare
sidney says nothing
shes visibly shaking
shes not answering any questions
just leave us alone okay
its okay tatum
shes just doing her job
yes thats right
dewey in a squad car turns into the alley and pulls up
the other news people have wisened up
they begin to flock the alley
hows the book
itll be out later this year
sidney tries to contain herself
squeezing a clenched fist
ill look for it
ill send you a copy
in a blurred unexpected instant sidney brings her fist forward smashing it hard into gale weatherss face
the impact sends gale reeling backwards knocking into kenny as they both tumble to the pavement
breathing deep a sense of satisfaction on her face
a spacious bedroom
tatum and sidney lay on the bed
they both wear night shirts
god i loved it
ill send you a copy
bitch went down
ill send you a copy
dewey appears in the doorway holding a bag of ice
i thought you might want some ice for that right hook
sidney sits up takes the ice and puts it on her hand
ill be right next door
try to get some sleep
dewey moves back out the door
any word on my dad
turning to her not yet but were looking
if you need anything
yeah yeah yeah
dewey smiles pulling the door closed on his way out
sidney lies back down
just another sleepover at the rileys
just like old times aint it
no nothings like it used to be
sidney rolls over at her side away from tatum
a telephone rings somewhere in the house
do you really think billy did it
he was there tatum
i knew this guy was too perfect
he was destined to have a flaw
a knock at the door
it opens and a friendly graying woman pops in
this is mama riley
she wears a comforting smile
who is it
its for sid my dad
mama riley shakes her head sadly
take a message
ill get it
sidney takes off out the door
mama riley motions to tatum
whispers how is she
sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall
from phone hello sidney
the camera does a hitchcock as sidneys entire body goes weak
his voice moving through her
she cries mama riley turns in the doorway
tatum comes bolting out of the bedroom
from phone poor billy boyfriend
an innocent guy doesnt stand a chance with you
looks like you fingered the wrong guy
who are you
hang up sid
youll find out soon enough
mama riley beats on a closed bedroom door
this is gonna be fun sidney
just like old times
dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers
holding his gun
the phone goes dead
sidney stands frozen
the morning sun shines high over bayboro townsquare
cars come to life townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a restless sleep
sidney and tatum sit at the kitchen table dressed and ready for school as mama riley serves up breakfast
a small television sits on the counter blaring
dewey in uniform stands near the door talking on the phone
i think you girls really should stay home today
your objection is duly noted
id rather be around a lot of people mama riley
from the tv sidney hears her name sidney prescott
all eyes go to the television
on tv who escaped a vicious attack last night was the daughter of maureen prescott who was brutally killed last year when convicted murderer cotton weary
insert of cotton weary in prison fatigues
a once handsome man now haggard and worn
contd broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased
cotton weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young sidney testified against him
she was the key witness in the states prosecution
its never gonna stop
dewey is off the phone
billy was released
his cellular bill was clean
he didnt make those calls
somebody called me dewey
im not making it up
were checking every cellular account in the county
any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross referenced
its gonna take time but well find him
and my dad
any word on him
riley shakes his head no
once again reporters line the street attacking students as they make their way to school asking questions hungry for that teenage insight
deweys patrol jeep cruises by
sidney watches from the passengers window
dewey pulls up in front of the school
tatum hops out while sid lingers suddenly unsure
dewey takes notice
hey its school
youll be safe here
sidney forces herself out of the jeep as a microphone is shoved in her face
how does it feel to almost be brutally murdered
dewey leaps from the car intercepting the reporter
leave the girl alone will ya
she wants to go to school
sidney eyes the newsvan thats pulled up behind her
the side door slides open and gale weathers steps out
come on sid
just a sec
i need to talk to someone
she heads over to gale
sidney puts her head down hiding her face
avoiding other reporters as she makes her way to
gale who sits in the open door checking her face in a mirror
makeup tries hard to hide sids handwork a swollen black and blue right cheek
gale spots sidney immediately and leaps to her feet
stop right there
sidney throws her hands up in surrender
im not here to fight
just stay back
i want to talk to you
calling into the van kenny
kennys head darts out from the van
off the record
sidney contains herself
you owe me
i owe you shit
gale moves inside the van
but sidney is relentless
you owe my mother
your mothers murder was last years hottest court case
somebody was gonna write a book about it
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories
what is your problem
you got what you wanted
cotton weary is in jail
theyre gonna gas him
a book is not gonna change that
do you still think hes innocent
gales interest is peaked
she eyes sidney suspiciously
he was convicted in a court of law
your testimony put him away
it doesnt matter what i think
during the trial you did all those stories about me
you called me a liar
i think you falsely identified him
have you talked to cotton
has his story changed
not one word
he admits to having sex with your mother but thats all
she wouldnt have touched him
he raped her then butchered her
her blood was all over his coat
he was drunk that night
he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him
i saw him leaving wearing it
but couldnt it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat
the same person who planted it in cottons car framing him
the same person who really killed your mother
a long beat
sidney considers this for the millionth time
no cotton murdered my mother
but theres doubt in her voice
gales face lights up
youre not so sure anymore are you
sidney clams up
no it was cotton
tatum comes waltzing up
to gale nice welt
gale ignores her zeroing in on sidney half realizing
the killer is still on the loose isnt he
these murders are related
yo lets rock
sidney starts to fidget
im sorry i mangled your face
she take off with tatum
gale calls after her
wait sidney dont go
but sidney and tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus
gale looks to kenny
an innocent man on death row
a killer still on the loose
kenny tell me im dreaming
you want to go live
gales mind races with possibilities
no not so fast
we have nothing concrete
when did that ever stop you
you cant sit on this
this is huge
if im gonna blow this up i need hard proof
but its so much easier when we make it up
not this time
i owe cotton that much
hell even i thought that man was guilty
tatum and sidney make their way across campus
youre at school now
no one can get you here
but if it wasnt billy it could be anybody
he could be here at school right now
they move up the walk as a figure falls in step behind them sporting a white ghost mask
serial killers are smart by definition
they minimize their risk
they plan and pre calculate everything
showing up here would be the most lame brain move he could make
he promised me hed be back
as easy as the figure appeared it disappears falling out of site unseen by either of them
i wouldnt put too much stock in a psychos promise
they move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the ghost masked figure reappears
standing at the top of the steps
sidney sees it first stopping dead in her tracks
she steps back spinning around to find
a ghost face behind her as well both of them approaching closing in on her
sidney starts to scream when the two ghosts bust up laughing tearing off across campus
in front of the school we catch up a reporter doing a live remote
he holds a mask in his hand
this morning several students in what appears to be a prank have been spotted wearing masks
school officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer
just before the bell
the hallway is congested with students heading to class
tatum is at her locker with sidney
this is a mistake
i shouldnt be here
i want you to meet me here right after class okay
billy appears in the crowd with stu tagging behind
tatum spots him first
shit what is he doing here
i bet hes pissed
just ignore him
you had good reason to think what you did
billy and stu approach
billys face is solemn
can we talk a sec
sidney says nothing
she can barely look at him
you know if i were accused of carving up two people id take the opportunity to skip school
hey go easy tatum
he didnt do it
talk to me sid
suddenly a scream erupts
all eyes go to a ghost masked student running down the hall screaming wildly running amuck
why are they doing this
are you kidding
this is like christmas
billy punches stu in the side
you open your mouth and stupidity pours out
sidney clearly upset takes off down the hall
billy races off after her
yelling stay away from her billy
tatum slams her locker door shut as the bell rings
with first period underway the halls have cleared
one or two struggling students can be seen rushing to class
sidney moves quickly down the hall rounding a corner running smack into
they collide hard catching sidney off guard scaring the life out of her
she falls backwards but billy catches her fall
hey hey its just me
sidney pulls away from him quickly
billy feels the slight
you dont still think its me
sidney catches her breath
oh god billy someone was there someone tried to kill me
the police say i scared him off
it wasnt me sid
he called again last night at tatums house
see it couldnt have been me
i was in jail remember
im so sorry
that i got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me
you know thats not true
then what is it
is there somebody else
is it the sex thing
am i being too pushy
no its me billy
i need time
im still adjusting to my mom
its been a year since she died
correcting him tomorrow
one year tomorrow
when are you gonna let that go sid
when my mom left my dad i just accepted it
this is the way it is
shes not coming back
sharply your parents split up
its not the same thing
your mom left town shes not in a coffin somewhere
you have to move on sid
sidney starts to walk away but turns back angry
im glad to know youre coping so well with life billy
but some of us arent so perfect
some of us are just trying to hold on
sidney disappears through a door marked girls bathroom leaving billy alone in the hallway
he smacks his forehead pissed at himself
large and spacious
closed bathroom stalls line one wall facing a row of sinks and a huge mirror
sidney enters as two girls tinkle and talk each from their respective stalls
she was never attacked
i think she made it all up
why would she lie about it
the girl has some serious issues
sidney listens intently
a toilet flushes
sidney quickly jumps in a stall hiding just as girl appears from a stall
she looks like that voice a snotty little twit
what if she did it
what if sidney killed casey and steve
and why would she do that
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage
another toilet flushes
why would sidney want to be with steve
she has her own bubble butt boyfriend billy
maybe shes a slut just like her mom
inside the stall sidney listens
her face weakening
please its common knowledge
her mother was a trollop
girl appears from her stall another twit
they both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces
cut some slack
she watched her mom get butchered
and it fucked her up royally
think about it
it makes perfect sense
her moms death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world shes disillusioned wheres god etc
and one day she snaps
she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year
and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression
from the stall sidney listens her heart pounding jaw quivering
where do you get this shit
the two girls exit
sidney moves out of the stall catching her reflection in the mirror
water drips somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind whistles in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door
it sound almost like a whisper siddneey
sidney spins around
she checks out the bathroom
the doors to the stalls are all closed
she bends down and scans beneath them looking for feet
sidney turns back to the mirror
unmistakable this time
the voice strikes sidney like a nail through the eye
it comes from one of the stalls
she stands thunderstruck eyeing the stalls thru the mirror
is someone there
a long morose silence
and then softly simply its me sidney
sidney spins around
terror floods her face
she eyes the exit door then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it
she checks under the stalls again
where the fuck is he
she takes a step forward when
two feet step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall
sidneys face draws tight as the stall door begins to creak open
she bolts forward making a break for it
but slips on the wet floor
her feet flying out from under
sidney reaches out
grabs hold of a sink
saves herself from falling
she glimpses a ghost mask in the mirror coming for her
a hand grabs her shoulder as she slams her body through the exit door
sidney flies out of the bathroom door screaming
burning up the hallway not looking back
a teacher hearing her scream peer out from an open doorway
as sidney sprints by him not stopping
close on a red faced principal himbry as he reads someone the riot act
your whole havoc inducing thieving whoring generation disgusts me
the camera swings around to reveal two ghost masked students standing at attention
himbry rips the mask off of one of the students heads
two students have been savagely murdered
and this is how we express our compassion and sensivity
he rips the mask off the other student
we throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again
youre both expelled
the ghosts doth protest
aw come on mr
himbry it was just a joke
yeah thats not fair
a deep rooted hostility has taken over mr
neither student budges scared to even breathe
no its not fair
fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized heartless little shits that you are
suddenly the door bursts open and sidney appears hysterical
crying hes here
i saw him
himbry rushes to her arms outstretched
sidney collapses in his arms
deweys patrol jeep is parked in front of the school
he stands in the open drivers door talking on the radio
from radio shes okay
looks like some boys were teasing her
himbrys shutting down the school though
i want you to take look around
yes sir sheriff
dewey shuts the jeep door and heads for campus when gale weathers appears her fake face aglow
field correspondent i know who you are maam
hows the eye
so theyre closing down the school
for the time being
dewey heads for the school building
gale scurries along side him flirtatiously
and why is that
has something happened
youre not supposed to be here maam
i know i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew
please call me gale
you look awfully young to be a police officer
deweys eyes wander down to gales long legs the way her hips move as she walks
hes clearly distracted
im twenty five years old maam
twenty five huh
in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males
i just missed you
of course you dont look a day over twelve except in the upper torso area
does the force require that you work out
dewey looks away blushing a bit
because of my boyish good looks muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer
they approach the schools front entrance
himbrys voice in amplified through intercoms across campus via the pa system
they stop to listen
via pa your attention please
due to the recent events that have occurred and until it comes to a resolve effective immediately all classes are suspended til further notice
the bayboro police dept
has also asked me to announce a city wide curfew beginning at oclock pm
gale speaks over mr
boy you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer
serial killer is not really accurate maam
the killer has yet to strike twice
well we can hope cant we
we certainly dont have any leads
a ghost mask a cellular phone not much there
were tracking the cellular phone bill
you small town guys are good
and have you located sidneys father
no not yet
hes not a suspect is he
we havent ruled out that possibil
dewey realizing hes said too much clams up
if youll excuse me maam
am i keeping you
thats quite alright
if i may say so maam youre much prettier in person
dewey starts up the schools front steps as the bell rings
so you do watch the show
he turns to her earnestly as students come pouring out the front doors
i just turned
i was for a whole year
you are precious
please call me gale
she smiles deliciously gives him a wink then struts off as dewey like a nervous little school boy watches her go
school is clearing out
the halls have begun to empty as tatum escorts sidney down the hallway
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh
it was him tatum
i know it
tatum wants to believe her but
you are not to be alone again
is that clear
if you pee i pee
is this not cool or what
hey sid what happened
for once stu drop it
okay but whatever you did the entire student body thanks you
stu moves to tatum and gives her a kiss
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break i propose we have a party
tonight my house
are you serious
my parents are out of town
itll be like my hurricane bash last year
just a few of us hangin
tatum warms to the idea
this could be good
what do you think sid
i dont know
pathos has its perks
sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited
remember theres safety in numbers
giving in yeah okay
see you guys tonight
stu speeds off sliding down the empty hallway
himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him
he picks one of them up snickering
he stands and moves to the closet next to his office door
he pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door
he tries the mask on pulling it over his face looking in the mirror when
a knock at the door stops him
he rips the mask off his head turns to his office door and opens it to reveal
an empty doorway
he pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around
but no ones there
the place is empty
a little suspicious he closes the door catching his reflection in the closet mirror
he looks at the mask in his hands
jesus even hes jumpy
two seconds later
another knock at the door
himbry grabs the door quickly this time throwing it open
again no ones there
he steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster
himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor
the overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted
he looks up and down the hall
only a janitor is seen in the distance pushing a broom
himbry returns to his office
himbry reenters his office moving to his desk when he spots the closet door now closed shut
this gives him a pause he had left it open
suddenly he cant remember
he shifts uneasy reaching for the door knob pulling the door open to reveal
an empty closet
he stands still a moment suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door
nervously he pushes it shut to reveal
himbry shakes away his jitters realizing hes spooked himself
he continues to his desk pushing his office door shut when
a ghost masked figure lunges from behind it
knife in hand
quick and easy
three quick jabs to the stomach and himbry goes down
the ghost masked figure towering above him
the late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing
tatum and sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood
deweys patrol jeep is parked in the driveway
despite loud music blaring from an inside stereo this is a quiet moment
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth
maybe he was having an affair with your mom
so you think my mom was a slut too
i didnt say that sid
but you know there were rumors
your dad was always out of town on business
maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman
if they were having an affair how come that cotton couldnt prove it in court
you cant prove a rumor
thats why its a rumor
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers
delicately it goes further back sid
theres been talk about other men
and you believe it
you can only hear that richard gere gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it
a long silence as sidney agonizes over all of this
she stands up and moves to the edge of the porch and stares out onto the neighborhood
if i was wrong cotton then hes still out there
dont go there sid
youre starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick
dont freak yourself out weve got a long night ahead of us
im cracking up
come on lets rock
sid follows tatum inside the house never seeing the ghost masked figure that stands across the street under a tree
his presence so subtle and unobtrusive youd have to see this movie a second time to know he was there all along
stu is moving along main street when billy comes barreling up next to him
howd you do
piece of cake
shell be there
thanks butt wart
you did good
so you gonna try and make up with sid
i was just asking
why are you always at me
because im trying to build your self esteem
youre far too sensitive
billy thumbs stus forehead
you ready to party hard tonight
you know it
they come to a building centrally located in the heart of main street
a huge blue monstrosity thats bigger than the local bank and post office combined
the sign in front reads you typical blockbuster huge and crowded
randy in his blockbuster get up is busy reshelving returns when stu appears knocking the videos out of his hand
jesus this place is packed
picking up videos we had a run in the mass murder section
you coming tonight
yeah im off early curfew you know
looking off now thats poor taste
randy refers to billy who stands down the aisle talking to two girls
the twits from the bathroom perhaps
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section
it was all a misunderstanding
he didnt do anything
youre such a little lap dog
hes got killer printed all over his forehead
the whyd the police let him go
because obviously they dont watch enough movies
this is standard horror movie stuff
prom night revisited
randy moves down the aisle reshelving videos
why would he want to kill his own girlfriend
theres always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend
thats the beauty of it all
besides if its too complicated you lose your target audience
so whats his reason
maybe sidney wouldnt have sex with him
shes saving herself for you
now that billys tried to mutilate her you think sid would go out with me
i think her father did it
how come they cant find his ass
because hes probably dead
his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere
see the police are always off track with this shit if theyd watch prom night theyd save time
theres formula to it
a very simple one
everyones always a suspect the father the principal the town derelict
which is you
so while theyre off investigating a dead end billy whos been written off as a suspect is busy planning his next hunting expedition
how do we know youre not the killer
randy spins around to find billy right behind him
maybe your movie freaked mind lost its reality button
randy shrugs laughing it off
youre absolutely right
im the first to admit it
if this were a scary movie id be the prime suspect
and what would be your motive
its motives are incidental
deweys patrol jeep makes its way down mainstreet
its almost dark
the street is close to deserted
deweys behind the wheel having a heated conversation with tatum while sid stares out the window
moms gonna kill you
dont be so self righteous
its just a little blow out well be perfectly safe
sid stares out the window
closed signs fill the storefronts a few people rush to their car in a hurry to beat curfew
god look at this place its the town hey i saw that movie
true story bout some killer in texas
just think if they make a movie about you
whos gonna play you
dewey comes to a stop parking the car in front of the police station
he looks to sid with a brotherly smile
i see you as a young meg ryan myself
but with my luck theyd cast tori spelling
they pile out of the jeep
dewey heads for the station
ill just be a few minutes
dont go far
the girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the street
is billy going to be there tonight
he better not be
i told stu to keep his mouth shut
i think we can live without everybodys all american for one night
they approach the grocery store
small and simple
sid and tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors
a lone checkout lady behind the counter big and frumpy looks up from counting money
you girls gonna have to hurry it up
were under curfew
two minutes tops
they make a bee line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a
ghost masked figure appears out of nowhere standing just outside watching quietly through the glass store windows
sheriff burkes face heats up as deputy riley marches in hurriedly
where the hell you been boy
keeping my eye on sidney
listen up dewey because its bad
aircomp just faxed us
the calls were listed to neil prescott sidneys father
he made the calls with his cellular phone
couldnt his cellular number have been cloned
guess what tomorrow is
the anniversary of his wifes death
it all fits
hes our man
have you contacted the bureau
they believe hes out of state by now
well keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night
if hes not picked up by morning well do a house to house
you think he could still be in town
hed have to be crazy
shes with my sister
should i bring her in
hold off for now
just stay close to her
shell be with her friends over at stu makers tonight
dont let on just keep your eyes out
sidney and tatum push a basket through the junk food section
the store is completely empty
the girls gab freely
whenever he touches me i just cant relax
you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mothers untimely death
its no big deal
youll thaw out
but hes been so patient with me tatum
you know with all the sex stuff
how many guys would put up with a girlfriend whos sexually anorexic
billy and his penis dont deserve you
sidney grabs some chips and salsa from the shelf
down the aisle through the storefront window the ghost masked figure still stands watching their every move
sid pushes the cart out of the glass door with tatum riding it
the ghost masked figure is nowhere to be found
what do you think about when youre having sex
with stu theres little time to stop and reflect
but sometimes before to relax and get in the mood i think about grant goodeve
sid pushes the cart and tatum across the street
grant goodeve the oldest brother on eight is enough
remember that show
he was the one who lived off alone
he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing eight is enough to fill our lives with love
he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge
god i was in love with grant he was so hot
the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years
grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman
how does that get you in the mood with stu
during foreplay i sing the theme song to myself
eight is enough to fill our lives with love
its a real turn on
grant wrote the song himself
im convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning eight is enough
sid pushes the cart up to deweys jeep
tatum hops off
what secret meaning
like a satanical thing
watch the show sid
his basket is bigger than the one youre pushing
a guy can talk tits til hes dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie
sidney stops just short of a laugh
tatum pulls the back jeep door loading the groceries in
behind her the ghost masked figure appears just out of their sight behind the jeeps open back door
theres that sense of humor
i knew it still existed
ohh sid lets have some fun tonight
sidney moves to the back door and closes it shut when from behind
sid jumps startled
you girls ready
looks like im your personal bodyguard tonight sid
youll ruin the whole night
sorry police orders
ill stay out of the way i promise
tatum kicks the shopping cart out of the way blindly
it rolls down the road by itself gaining speed on a decline running smack into the ghost masked figure who stops the cart cold with one hand
deweys jeep makes its way down a long winding road
headlights illuminate the thick woods that line each side
following behind them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan
dewey comes to the end of the road
it dead ends at
stus house which sits alone in a clearing big and ominous with no neighbors in sight
a huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and
from the looks of things the party has already started
music is blaring
a few kids hang on the porch
a big room with kids sprinkled throughout smoking drinking cutting up
a stereo blasts music while the tv airs around the clock killer coverage
tatum and sid enter with groceries
various friends greet them
the girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen
stu and some guys are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel
where you guys been
we had to start without you
the newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a few feet down from the front yard
kenny and gale move around inside the van
kenny hovers over a control panel complete with video monitors
whats the plan
prep the compact well hide it in a window and tape all of tonights festivities
kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist
he checks its battery pack
the control boards glitched
you know we cant carry a live picture
whats the delay
about thirty seconds
as long as it records i dont give a shit
were not doing a remote
gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness not seeing the figure that stands behind her
a hand grabs her shoulder gales heart stops as she spins around to find
dewey smiling extremely pleased to see her
what brings you out to these parts
you never know when or where a story will break
not much story here
just a bunch of kids cutting loose
then what are you doing here
keeping an eye on things
checking the place out
mind if i join you
dewey considers for a whole two seconds
not at all
gale leans in the van grabs the camera from kennys hand and throws it in her bag
she gives kenny a wink
close on a microwave
popcorn pops inside
camera widens to sid stu and tatum moving about the kitchen preparing a junk food feast
other teens pop in and out
randy appears amongst them
he carries an armful of videos
i thought wed make it a blockbuster night
he lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter
stu and tatum dive in
i thought everything was checked out
i had em hid in the foreign section
sidney peruses the videos
how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies
shes the scream queen
with that set of lungs she should be
to sid tits see
the party is going strong
ten maybe fifteen people stand sit lean
some crowd around the floor in front of the television
randy is taking a vote
how many evil deads
hands go up how many hellraisers
hands go up
bickering ad lib etc
the doorbell rings
stu goes for it
i got it
tatum get me a beer
theyre in the fridge in the garage
what am i
the beer wench
hey guess whos here
its that chick from inside story
they look up the hallway to see dewey and gale standing in the foyer
everyone perks up eyeing gale
what is she doing here
shes with me
i just wanted to check on things
the guys in the room are drooling over gale
so you did now leave
and take your media muff with you
tatum takes off for the kitchen
gale has quickly become the focus of the party
all eyes are on her
i watch your show regularly
this must be big news to be on inside huge
wanna interview us
we could be like two grief stricken students and well say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly
i can cry on cue
gale eyes the bookshelf above the television
suddenly gale starts to cough
can i trouble you for some water
how bout a beer
randy get the lady a beer
you get it
gale slips the camera from her bag hits the on switch and holds it behind her
waiting for the right moment
have they found my father
should i be worried
tatum is alone in the kitchen
she empties popcorn into a bowl then pulls open the refrigerator
looks quickly then remembers
she moves through the adjoining laundry room to the
the kitchen door opens and light floods the darkened garage
tatum stands in the doorway searching for a light switch
she finds a button and hits it
the electric garage door starts to rise
she hits it again and it closes
she finds another switch
a small lightbulb overhead comes on barely lighting the large two car garage leaving pockets of shadows along the wall
tatum spots the refrigerator against a far wall and heads for it not seeing the kitchen door quietly slowly closing behind her sealing her off from the rest of the
tatum stumbles to the refrigerator and throws it open
its light casts a glow across her face
tatum jumps spinning around just in time to see a cat escape through a large pet door thats built into the garage door
she smiles at her jumpiness
tatum loads up with as many beer as her hands will carry and heads back to the kitchen
at the kitchen door she juggles the beer reaching for the knob
she kicks it with her foot several times
tatum leans over and with her elbow hits the garage door button
it begins to rise
she moves towards the rising door beer in hand
suddenly crr brrrm
the garage door resets reversing direction moving down closing
tatum spins around to see
silhouetted in the dark next to the kitchen door his hand on the switch
tatum at once gasps taken back but then relaxes
is that you randy
the figure stares at her blankly
and what movie is this from
i spit on tatum takes a step towards the figure
lose the mask
if sidney sees it shell flip
the figure shakes his head slowly from side to side
oh you wanna play psycho killer
the figure slowly nods
can i be the helpless victim
the figure slowly nods again
okay lets see
no please dont kill me mr
i want to be in the sequel
tatum takes a step to move around the figure but he steps too blocking her
thats a wrap
tatum moves again sidestepping the figure but hes faster and cuts her off
tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the figure hard knocking him aside
randy will you stop
but as the figure intercepts lunging forward grabbing her wrist hard tatum stumbles
beer cans hit the floor spewing
you little shit
tatum yanks hard releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye
she looks down glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward cutting into her forearm
tatum pulls back horrified as the moment turns deadly serious
the figure advances on her knife out ready
she staggers backwards holding her bloody arm backing into the refrigerator who are you
the figure lashes out with the knife
tatum dodges it leaping back against the fridge
the figure advances
instinctively she rips the top freezer door open bashing the figure in the face sending him backwards reeling
tatum bolts to the
closed garage door
in a panic she beats and pulls on it trying to make it lift
she eyes the figure
she goes for the pet door dropping to the floor diving for it
she wedges her upper body through her head shoulders torso just as the
figure pounces grabbing hold of her feet
tatum goes crazy screaming and kicking trying to get through
tatum is half in half out of the pet door
she beats and jerks wildly unable to see the figure on the other side
a true fighter tatum kicks hard making direct contact with the figure knocking him away
she takes the moment to pull herself through further
but she stops
she pulls and tugs but cant move
she listens but hears nothing
where did he go
an agonizing silence
the garage door is activated
it begins to rise upward taking tatum with it
she screams madly
tatums arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door but it moves too fast carrying her up
she looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam snapping instantly
its getting late and some kids leave through the front door muttering parents and curfew etc
the door hangs open wide
sid moves to close it when
billy appears in a classic fake scare
jesus you scared me
with a wink dude
what are you doing here
i was hoping sid and i could talk
if tatum sees you shell draw blood
you guys can go up to my parents room
to talk and
look it up
we need to talk
sid grabs his hand and leads him up the staircase
randy appears from the kitchen just in time to see sid and billy disappear upstairs
whats leatherface doing here
he came to make up
there goes my chance with sid
like you had one
kenny fidgets at the control board
he hits a coupla buttons bangs the side of the monitor and a picture emerges
the living room
the camera is positioned just above the television
the party is in full swing
several teens sit right in front of the television
because of the cameras position they appear to be staring right into the lens
suddenly the vans side door slides open and gale pops in
got a picture
we can see everything
gale is ecstatic
tell me kenny has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the pulitzer
a large master bedroom with glass doors that lead out onto a balcony
sid and billy stare at each other for a long moment
ive been a selfish shit and im sorry
im the one whos been selfish and self absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress
you lost your mom
but youre right enough is enough
i cant wallow in the grief process forever and i cant keep lying to myself about who my mom was
billy bows his head quietly knowingly
i think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way im scared im gonna turn out just like her you know
like the bad seed or something
everytime i get close to you i see my mom
i know it doesnt make sense
sure it does
its like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father
but this is life
this isnt a movie
sure it is sid
its all a movie
lifes one great big movie
only you cant pick your genre
billy moves to her
they embrace tenderly
i wanna let go
everythings gonna be okay
sidney takes the initiative acting on impulse kissing him long and hard
she breaks away passionately out of breath
why cant i be a meg ryan movie
billy nibbles her neck
or even a good porno
she stares at him her eyes sexually charged
you heard me
incredulous are you serious
surprising herself yeah
i think so
they smile at each other
the camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks completely inconspicuous
the camera widens to reveal several teens watching the tv the horror diehards
look here it comes
the bloods not the right color
why do they do that
its too red
here comes another
knew he was going to bite it
how can you watch this shit over and over
i wanna see jamie lees breasts
when do we see jamie lees breasts
not until trading places in
jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies
she didnt show her tits until she went legit
thats why she always lived
only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end
dont you know the rules
stu finishes his beer
randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television explaining
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie
you can never have sex
the minute you get a little nookie youre as good as gone
sex always equals death
never drink or do drugs
the sin factor
its an extension of number one
never ever ever under any circumstances say ill be right back
wanna another beer
ill be right back
there he goes folks a dead man
wave bye bye
gale and kenny watch the monitor
the party is clearing out some a rap at the van door
gale pulls it open to see deputy riley standing his face all smiles
sheriff just radioed me
im gonna check out a possible lead
thought you might like to join me
what kind of lead
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road
id love to
if youre sure its alright
maam i am the deputy of this town
can i bring kenny
too quickly no
i should probably take just you
gale steps out of the van turning back to kenny
ill be back
she slides the van door closed
gale heads for deweys patrol jeep
actually i thought we could walk
its not far
gale appears skeptical but smiles anyway
shes genuinely smitten by this young guy
scary music fills the room
the party is reduced to the diehards in front of the television
pointing to tv look here comes the obligatory tit shot
billy and sidney are going at it
he has his head buried in her neck
to herself eight is enough to fill our lives with love
sidney pushes billy off her as she pulls her shirt over her head
she fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the
camera rushes in on her breasts
just as sids bra straps slide of her shoulders
billy moves in front of the camera pulling his jeans off blocking sidney from view
back in the living room the horror fest continues when the phone rings
everyone ignores it
it rings again
finally randy grabs the receiver from the side table
randy freaked drops the phone finds the tv remote and pauses the movie the others protest hey put is back
they found principal himbry dead
he was gutted and hung from the goal post on the football field
this stills the room
complete silence as the news sinks in
on different faces
a moment of devastation
and then so what are we waiting for
lets get over there before they pry him down
and in seconds the room is empty as everyone bolts for the door
hootin and hollerin
leaving randy near drunk alone in the living room
he returns to the movie
we were just getting to the good part
kenny is barely watching the monitor he reached boredom some time ago
he finds a bag of cheetos and chows down when he hears screaming from outside
he peers out the window to see the last of the party kids pile into two cars and race off down the road
he chews a cheeto slowly his interest piqued
the sex is over
and both sid and billy are dressing respectively
that post sex awkwardness
sid brushes out her hair as her eyes come to rest on the telephone on the nightstand
it puzzles her as a stark reveleation crosses her face
she turns to billy who sits on the floor putting on his shoes
who did you call
when youre arrested youre allowed one phone call
who did you call
i called my dad
no sheriff burke called your dad
i saw him
and when i called no one answered
you dont still think it was me
no but if it were you that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track
using your one phone call to call me so i wouldnt think it was you
billy stands up
what do i have to do to prove to you im not a killer
he makes a move toward her when
from behind in a split instant from the open balcony doors comes
sidney sees the figure immedietely screaming
billy tries to calm her oblivious to the advancing ghost
billy barely turns as a long steely blade rises high in the air
it strikes down with force
hitting his chest as blood sprays the air
on sidney as red crimson splatters across her face
as the knife is thrust in and out of billy who tries hard to put up a fight
but its useless
he never had a chance
his body falls to the floor
as he watches billys body come to a still before quietly calmly turning his attention to
sidney who stands numb
scared to death
and only when the ghost takes a step forward does sidney break
she takes off like a rocket
leaping over the bed and out the door
sidney tears out the door and down the hall coated in billys blood
as he catches up with her grabbing hold of her collar
she pulls away from him
her shirt ripping down the back
her hands find a door knob and she goes for it pulling the door open
moving quickly inside
locking it behind her
sidneys hands scour the wall for a light switch
the doorknob turns
the lock holds
as the door is nearly shaken from its hinges
all goes silent
only sidneys rapid breathing fills the space around her
sidney trembling shaking reaches above her feeling until she finds a string
she pulls it
as a lightbulb switches on overhead
shes in a small box of a room
the door is on one side a small narrow staircase on the other
she eyes the doorknob then the staircase
but its an easy decision
theres no fucking way shes going up to the attic
she unlocks the door and pushes on it
but it wont give
she pushes on it again
its locked from the other side
she turns to the staircase
a long deserted country road
in the distance a single flashlight beams ahead the only light in the black night
gale and dewey can be heard
so is dewey your real name
dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago
i like it
its just this towns way of not taking me serious
what about gale weathers
i sound like a meteorologist
close on gale and dewey walking closely side by side flirtatiously
gale is surprisingly nervous
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism
i dont think youre so bad
are all the local boys as sweet as you
he starts to say something when headlights appear behind them
they both spin as two cars loaded with kids come racing right at them
dewey grabs gale and pushes her off the road
just as the cars speed by oblivious to them
gale lands face up with dewey right on top of her
he steals a glance in her eyes before rolling off her
something takes gales attention
dewey looks to where gale points
he finds the flashlight and aims it into the bush
the tail end of a car is just visible
looks like a car
dewey helps her up and they move to it
he shines the flashlight on the plates but its already obvious to the camera
this is the same car we last saw sidneys father driving away in
its neil prescotts car
we gotta get back
what the fuck is he doing here
dewey is panicked
he grabs gale and they race off down the road
randy continues to watch tv
he is now sloppy drunk completely involved in the movie on the screen
scary music swells filling the room
to tv no jamie
look behind you
and if he followed his own advice he would see the ghost masked figure that stands directly behind him
kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand
he tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye
on the monitor is randy still on the couch engrossed in the movie
directly behind him
kenny does a double take
no fucking way
he watches as the ghost stands still unmoving knife raised
the ghost takes a silent step forward
screaming at the monitor this kid needs help
kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side door
he slides it open and sticks his head out as
comes at kenny fast and furious
slicing into his throat
kenny falls forward
out the door as the ghost masked figure is upon him
just in time to see the ghost masked figure turn away from randy leaving him unharmed moving instead out the front door on a thirty second walk to the newsvan
the attic is long and narrow
cluttered with furniture boxes and the likes
moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house
sidney moves through the attic
bumping into this knocking over that
she passes a dusty mirror jumping at her own reflection
she cringes at her image drenched in billys blood
she stares long and hard
something about the blood the redness of it
she moves on determined
she eyes the raised window above her
a way out
if she could only reach it
gale and dewey come running up the drive frantic
ill call for backup
ill get my camera
they split up
the camera follows gale as she rushes to the newsvan throwing open the door
the van is empty
a car horn goes off
gale spins around
it came from the patrol jeep in the driveway
calling out dewey
she moves across the yard to the jeep the door hangs open
dewey is nowhere to be found
where are you
a look of pure dread comes over gale
sidney has stacked object after object building a ladder to the window
she climbs to the top holding onto the window frame
she spots gale almost immedietely
she screams out looking for the window latch
but theres not one
it doesnt open
sidney starts beating on it
trying to break it
gale hanging tough approaches the front door unable to hear sidneys screams three floors up
gale reaches for the door just as she hears loud horrible shrieks from just inside
she backs away
an ear curdling jamie lee curtis scream blasts through the empty living room as the horror movie on tv comes to its horrifying climax
randy is now gone
gale races across the yard putting distance between her and the house
she moves back to the van
sidney has found an old tennis racket
she swings a solid forehand at the window
sidney moves quickly lifting herself up over broken glass and pulling herself through the window frame
sidney wastes no time
she looks for gale screaming but gale is gone
sid lowers herself down the ledge sliding down a sloped portion of the roof onto
then she eases herself over the railing and lowers herself letting herself hang as low as she can
then she lets go free falling the rest of the way
but in a split instant
grabbing her wrists in midair
her body hangs dangling against the side of the house
the ghost begins to lift her pulling her back onto the balcony
sidney jerks pulls twists
but the hands have her hoisting her up
sidney screams madly
yanking one last time freeing herself
she drops to the ground a good seven feet landing on her back hitting hard
she grabs at a pained leg and brings herself upright
gale is frantic
she starts the engine up and hits the headlights when she discovers she cant see out of the windshield
gale rubs at the glass
sure enough something is on the windshield outside blocking her sight
gale hits the wipers as blood smears across the glass it drips down from above
gale screams as a hand reaches in through the open window
she looks up to see
randy staring at her madly
whats going on
a sheer moment of fear as gale hits the gas plummeting the car forward into a ditch
she hits the brakes
randy is thrown forward away from the van
gale reverses backs up hits the brakes again
just as kennys face comes sliding down the outside of the windshield
eyes wide face distorted blood everywhere
gale hits the gas and yanks the wheel sending kennys corpse flying off the top of the van
gale spins the van around onto the road hits the gas madly gaining speed just as
in the middle of the road drenched in blood very much resembling a young sissy spacek
gale swerves to miss her but she turns too sharp and the van veers off the road at top speed
flipping over on its side sliding off into the thick foliage
sidney races to where the van lay on its side
sidney peers through the windshield
gales body lay limp and bloody
sidney cries out turning limping to the driveway
she sees the patrol jeep with its open door
she goes for it
sidney hops in reaches for the ignition
just then sidneys eyes go to the front porch
she watches as the front door opens and a figure appears in the darkness undetectable
sidney throws the headlights
illuminating the front side of the house revealing
sidney opens the jeep door moving to him noticing his body slumped knees buckled
and then his body falls forward slowly deliberately hitting the porch hard
standing behind him is
sid jumps back inside the jeep closing the door locking it
she reaches over and locks the passengers door and then she
and watches as the ghost leans over deweys still body fumbling with something
then the figure stands upright in his hands he holds
they jingle in the wind the ghost toying with her enjoying this
sidney hysterical locks eyes with the figure as he moves to the door sidney leaps on it holding the lock button down making it impossible to unlock
her face is pressed against the glass
inches from the masked figure
she uses every ounce of strength when suddenly the ghost disappears dropping down below the window out of her view
sidney moves to the center of the jeep trying hard to listen over her own rapid breathing every sound amplified
then she hears it the soft jingling of keys near the passengers side door
she pounces on the lock holding it down
a shadow cuts the beam of the headlights unseen by sidney
the lock turns on the other side
sidney leaps over and holds it down securing it
this is beyond nerve racking
sidney is certifiable
her eyes spot the police radio for the first time
she grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch
im at stu makers house on turner lane
please hes gonna angle through front windshield
sidney ranting into the police band
she doesnt see the
ghost figure open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her
the ghost figure reaches out and grabs hold of sidneys neck
sidney with surprising strength spins around and attacks the she falls back against the dash legs out kicking wildly at him
her hand reaches for the door finds the lock the door lever she pulls
the door swings open
sidney falls out of the door hitting the ground
sidney on her stomach squirms away from the jeep
she brings herself up to her hands and knees looking behind her to see nothing
sidneys eyes roam the yard but hes nowhere
sid crawls to the front porch where
thinking quickly precisely she reaches to deweys holster and grabs his gun when a voice echos behind her
she turns to see randy racing to her limping
he appears stone cold sober
we gotta get out of here
sidney throws the gun forward
dont come any closer
listen to me sid
i found tatum
shes dead shes been killed
i think stu did it
he takes a step forward when another voice speaks up
dont believe him sid
sidney spins around to see stu moving up the walk
he killed tatum
stu moves closer to sidney
she aims the gun in his direction
his movie nut mind has snapped sid
hes gone psycho
dont listen to him
hes the one
sidney has lost it she doesnt know who to trust
she aims the gun at stu
come on sid
give me the gun
they both move toward her
theres no time
she must act now
fuck you both
and with that sidney steps back into the house and slams the front door shut
sid locks and bolts the door
from the other side she can hear randy screaming
his fists pound against the door
sidney stumbling in the darkness rushes to the phone in the living room
just as she reaches for it
it scares the life out of her
she screams yanking it up
from the phone having fun sidney
sidney falls apart screaming
she throws the phone down disconnecting the call
sid moves back to the door
randys screams are maddening
she eyes the lock deliberating
at the door sidney looks up the staircase into the darkness her face shocked to see
emerging from the shadows stumbling down the stairs
very much alive
hes blood soaked and dazed
sidney meets him in the landing grabbing him holding him
i thought you were
billy goes for the door
hes out there
randy continues pounding on the door screaming at the top of his through door please you gotta let me in
hes gonna kill me
billy goes for the door
sidney blocks him
dont believe him
give me the gun
sidney hands him the gun
billy turns and unlocks the door opening it
randy rushes in grabbing billy pleading
calming him shhhh
stus flipped out
hes gone mad
slowly a small smile creeps across billys face
we all go a little mad sometimes
randy squints confused as billy aims the gun at randy and pulls the trigger
the blast throws randys body against the wall before sliding to a heap on the floor
anthony perkins psycho who stands only feet away face aghast
this cant be happening
billys eyes are on her unmoving
he sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his face
same stuff they used for pigs blood in carrie
sidney is dumbfounded
slowly she takes a step back moving into the dark refines of the kitchen
billy lurches forward in a fake out baiting her
she takes another step back petrified
close on billys face
it is no longer familiar to sidney
there is something inhuman now about his features
his expression is pure evil
she takes another step back shrinking into the dark kitchen
the camera takes a moment to adjust to the darkness as the outline of a figure appears
she continues to back up moving right into the arms of
sidney spins around
her mouth open in speechless horror
stu stares back at her eyes wide lips curled in a subtle smile as he holds a small compact cellular phone up to his face
whispering into phone surprise sidney
his voice sounds affected now
the voice of the killer
sidney looks back to billy then to stu then to billy again
it becomes all too clear
she stands between them her mind racing calculating
if for no other reason than to put space between her and them
they stand in the entryway trapping her in
where ya going
its not over yet
weve got one more surprise stu i believe its your turn
oh yeah stu disappears into the kitchen
to sidney whats wrong
you look like youve seen a ghost
sidney stands trying hard to hold a calm resolve
a noise comes from the kitchen
a low dragging sound
stu reappears from the front hall
wrestling with something
close on stu
he has a body in tow he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room
sidney looks down to find
bound and gagged
his eyes wide in fear very much alive
she starts for him
stu places the cellular phone in mr
prescotts shirt pocket
guess i wont be needing this anymore
why are you doing this
its all part of the game
its called guess how im going to die
we already played that game
you lost remember
you have to play sid
dont want to disappoint your dad
hes been waiting around all night
its an easy game
we ask you a question
if you get it wrong you die
and if you get it right you die
youre crazy both of you
the official term is psychotic
youll never get away with this
tell that to cotton weary
you wouldnt believe how easy it was to frame him
yeah we just watched a few movies
took a few notes
it was fun
billy and stu relish their madness proud of themselves
sidney looks to her dad sees the tears in his eyes
she looks back to billy unflinching
a determined look on her face
why did you kill my mother
did you hear that stu
i think she wants a motive
i dont really believe in motives sid
i mean did norman bates have a motive
stu plays along shaking his head
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people
dont think so
you see its scarier when theres no motive sid
fighting tears i dont understand
we did your mom a favor sid
the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something
laughing so we put her out of her misery
i mean lets face it your mom was no sharon stone
stu cracks up over this while billy turns very serious
is that motive enough for you
or how about this
did you know your slut mother was sleeping with my dad and shes the reason my mom moved out and deserted me
a sudden silence
sidney is rigid with shock his words resonant with truth
even stu is surprised with his seriousness
think about it
on the off chance i get caught a motive like that could divide a jury for years dont you think
you took my mother so i took yours
big sympathy factor
maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior
it certainly fucked you up
it made you have sex with a psychopath
thats right and now that youre no longer a virgin
you gotta die those are the rules
billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer
and then moves to sidney with the butcher knife in hand
pretend this is all just a scary movie sid
how do you think its going to end
sidney doesnt respond
excited this is the best part sid
billys got it all figured out
why do you think we kept your father alive so long
why did we save you for last
you know what time it is sid
its after midnight
its your mothers anniversary
we killed her exactly one year ago today
billy turns to stu with the knife
they eye each other
billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly slicing into stu
he stumbles to ho his knees wincing in pain
as blood gushes
real blood a dark deep red
stu inspects the wound to his side
then he smiles
he takes the knife from billy
dont forget stay to the side and dont go too deep
stu stabs at billys belly puncturing him
billy doubles over
fuck that hurt
squelching the pain got the ending figured out yet
times running out
come on sid
think about it
your father is the chief suspect
we cloned his cellular
the evidence is there
billy takes the knife and slashes at stus arm two quick cuts
he doubles over
what if your father snapped
your moms anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree killing everyone
in major pain except for me and billy
we were left for dead
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head
its a perfect ending
everyone dies but us
we get to carry on and plan the sequel
lets face it these days you gotta have a sequel
stu takes the knife and cuts at billy
you sick fucks youve seen one too many movies
billy looks at her bent over crazed
oh sid dont blame the movies
movies dont create psychos
movies just make psychos more creative
stu staggers a bit
thats it billy
i cant take any more
im feeling woozy
get the gun
ill untie pops
billy moves to sidneys father
whered you put it
stu is searching the foyer for the gun
its on the table
no its not
billy hobbles over
the gun is gone
where the fuck is it
off camera right here asshole
billy and stu look up in unison to see
standing in the front door way gun in hand
her body tattered and bloody
her hair a mess
i thought she was dead
she looked dead
gale holds the gun firm in total control
ive got an ending for you
the reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to stumbles upon you two dipshits finds the gun fumbles your plan and saves the day
sidney steps forward
i like that ending
billy lunges at gale but she holds steady
billy and stu eye each other
she cant get both of us
odds are shell miss anyway
in a mad rush they storm gale heading straight at her
she pulls the trigger but nothing happens
the safety is on
billy charges forward grabbing hold of the front door slamming it shut
it catches gale in the face knocking her backwards out the door
she goes down
billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where gale lays
then he turns back inside the house to find
whered she go
stu looks around staggering now bleeding heavily
sidney has completely disappeared
only her father bound and gagged remains in the living
i dont know billy but im hurtin
where the fuck did she go
suddenly the phone rings
billy and stu look at each other
billy scrambles over to the phone
picking up phone hello
from phone are you alone in the house
billy looks to mr
the cellular phone is gone
you bitch where the fuck are you
not so fast
were gonna play a little game
its called guess who just billy looks around the living room
billy is fuming now
and starting to lose it
he screams at stu who has fallen to his knees
im bad off billy
you cut to deep
billy throws the phone at stu
he mouths to him so sid cant hear
talk to her
then billy takes off for the kitchen
stu takes the phone
aware so stu whats your motive
billys got one
the police are on their way
what are you going to tell them
im way to sensitive
billy flies back in the room grabbing the phone from stu
hes completely nuts now staggering bleeding totally insane
screaming in phone im gonna rip you up bitch
just like your slut whore mother
gotta find me first you pansy assed mamas boy
billy starts ripping the room up overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage
when he notices the hall closet
he smiles deliriously heading for it ripping it open as
a ghost masked figure strikes from within with an umbrella the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out
billy stumbles back stunned as the ghost comes at him again
the umbrella lodges in his chest and he goes down
sidney rips the ghost mask off her head
she looks at billy disgusted throwing the mask on billys now still body
a movement behind her sends her reeling around to find
randy slowly sitting up
his body drenched in blood
he looks to sidney
you know what i hate most about horror movies
the final scene
it just goes on and on
and it gets so stupid
randy manages to stand when a figure comes leaping at him completely unexpected
barreling into him
they fall back into the living room
sidney grabs the gun next to billy and turns to the living room to find
randy and stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock fighting both seriously injured
sid tries to find aim when a
hand grabs hold of sidneys ankle toppling her to the floor
once again she finds billy on top of her
randy and stu pound at each other beating and clawing
on sidney as she fights viciously attacking with everything shes got
randy is desperately trying to pry away from stu
he grabs hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of stus clutch
his hands find the top of the tv
he yanks on it gripping it with his hands bringing it around with force crashing the vcr into stus head
on sidney as she digs her hand into billys open chest wound
he cries out bloody murder
her other hand brings the gun up to his face
but he head bunts it out the front door
suddenly a flash of silver appears above sidney
billy has grasped the butcher knife
he rises it high above sidney ready to strike
when a bullet rips through the foyer striking billy knocking him back into the living room
sidney looks up to see
gale weathers holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the guns chamber
sidney sits up as gale moves to her helping her
their eyes meet
a life truce
billy and stu lay face up head to head
sid and gale move over them staring down
randy joins them
sid you found me out
im a virgin
and pretty happy about it right now
sidney nudges their bodies
they both stir
this is the moment when you think the killers dead but then he springs back to life for one last scare
sidney grabs the gun from gale
not this time
she positions her foot on stus chest and aims
this is for my mom asshole
she shoots him in the forehead a clean and perfect shot
the she aims the barrel at billy whos eyes suddenly open blinking up at her blood bubbling from his lips
hes not yet dead
their eyes lock
and this billy stud bucket is for having an incredibly small weenie
she fires another perfect shot
theyre both goners
sidney drops the smoking gun standing silent over the bodies
a quiet moment when suddenly
both sid and gale and randy scream in epic final scare proportions as mr
prescott leaps forward still bound and gagged
sid catches her breath relaxing
she rushes to him untying him
while gale moves to the bookcase and retrieves the hidden camera
i wanna close up
randy appears by sidneys side helping her untie her father
this is probably an inappropriate moment but you think youd want to maybe go out with me sometime
like on a date
sidney looks at him dumbfounded
maybe catch a movie
a long moment as sidneys face goes from disbelief to resignation to the slight trace of a smile
only if its a nice meg ryan movie
you got it
he smiles at her
watching as sidney grabs hold of her father holding him tight as gale weathers with camera in hand gets one hell of an ending to this scary movie
