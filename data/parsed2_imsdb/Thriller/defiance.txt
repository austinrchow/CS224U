written by clayton frohman edward zwick a taxi pulls over to a curb where an elderly man waits with his middle aged son in the rain
as they climb in rd and lex
the cabbie grunts a reply
how ya doin papa you doin alright
this is just a check up okay
doctor katz says youll outlive us all
looks out the window traffic isnt bad
we should be back in time to watch the mets
he notices his father is staring wide eyed at the cabbys hack license
we glimpse only the last name
papa what is it
in the rear view mirror the old man catches the furtive eyes of the cabby
can it be
the eyes in the mirror look away
and then back
can it possibly be
as we push in on the eyes in the mirror we hear the bombs explode all around as he passes dead bodies and burnt out vehicles
without slowing he discards a ww ii red army helmet a field jacket a heavy pack anything that might impede his flight
he glances back up over his shoulder
the sky is filled with bombers
he runs on
a typical eastern european shtetl
local police help german einsatzgruppen mobile killing squads round up jews
peasants beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines
one man tries to run and is beaten
others look on or look away with indifference as they are loaded onto waiting trucks
we study their faces a turbulent portrait of impotent rage terrible fear overwhelming grief and secret relief
where are they taking them
just shut up
the man we last saw in flight tuvia bielski wearing the remnants of his uniform slips down a cobble stoned street
he ducks into a doorway as a patrol passes by
zus and asael move warily through a barnyard
a tethered dog barks furiously
a farmer challenges them
in russian subtitles walencki brandishes a pitchfork
in russian subtitles some food
they are looking for you people
the two brothers glance nervously around
get away from here
zus the older of the two brothers takes a menacing step toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back
as they retreat toward the woods zus warns the farmer
well be back
tuvia is getting dressed as an attractive woman his wife rifka stands by the window smoking a cigarette
and no news of my brothers
they are used to trouble theyll be all right
if you stay youll have to go to the ghetto
i can get false papers and pass as a gentile
so can you
tuvia shakes his head no
he finishes dressing
theirs is a relationship long past passion
will you at least stay tonight
i need to see to my family
will you come
to the country
a pair of legs lie motionless behind a trough
beyond a mans torso
zus and asael stare in mute horror
flies buzz about dead livestock
a womans body lies nearby
a still portrait of a life interrupted
double green revision
a table set for dinner
an open book
a noise from a cupboard
zus grabs a hatchet
from the root cellar a young boy appears
his face is dirty and tear streaked
they go to embrace him
the boy aron recoils
he is disoriented and will not loaded down with possessions asael hurries back to the woods
zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the door
aron stares mutely straight ahead
asael is shaking uncontrollably and crying
zus is at a loss what to do
but asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic
finally zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence and comfort
and holds him as asael rocks back and forth
a million acres of dense impenetrable woods and swamps
the sound of a footstep
they sit up in terror
if i was a german you are dead
asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself
papa and mama
they killed them
asael clings to him
even aron allows himself to be held
tuvia hold them silently
zus appears hatchet in hand
big brother returns
tuvia and zus look at each other warily
you saw them
tuvia saw them
zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket tosses it to tuvia
is torn apart by filthy hands as they move through the trees
are you going back to the army
there is no more army
asael worships his big brother
hope at least you killed a few
tuvia just stares at him
what is it like
to be in a war
it wasnt war
it was something else
zus eyes him carefully
where is sonia and the baby
hiding in a cellar
ill bring her when it is safe
where is rifka
she wouldnt leave
you are still separated
she is still my wife
your rich wife
zus chews with the open mouthed relish of a peasant
so why exactly have you come back
tuvia just stares at him
the reason is obvious as he holds his younger brothers
you have a plan
shivering and miserable they are trying to start a fire
asaels few remaining matches are sodden
is there anything left to eat
only a few potatoes in asaels bag
worms writhe among them
zus finished the last of the sausage
tuvia glares at zus who glares back
stankowicz farm is closest
he has dogs
fuck the dogs
you think wilencki is going to give us food
we take it
and he tells the police
i have run from the police my whole life
do you really think its a good time to stop
a moment of decision
who holds the balance of power
we know these woods
theyll never find us in here
tuvia looks at his brothers
he has been outvoted
where zus and asael first tried to get food
asael waits outside anxiously on guard
the farmer walencki who threatened them with the pitchfork sits eating a simple dinner
zus and tuvia burst in
zus brandishes a hoe
in russian subtitles we want food
be quick about it
in russian subtitles you again
take what you want
tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack
where is your gun farmer
i have no gun
zus grabs a dinner plate and smashes it in the farmers holding his bloody face the farmer cowers in fear
zus kicks him
i beg you
he kicks him again
the farmer begins to weep
zus dumps the remains of the farmers dinner onto him
if i hit you once more you will shit your pants
twice and you will never shit again
the farmer knows zus wont hesitate
zus kicks the man aside
above the stove is an old rifle
zus grabs it points it at the farmer
we were never here
running through the woods
zus raises the rifle in triumph
he was willing to help us
hes lucky i didnt crush his head
ive eaten shit from these people long enough
this is your plan
to terrorize every anti semite in belorussia
some i will kill
aron has been left alone
he holds a stick which he shoots like a gun kachew as he creeps from tree to tree
something is moving in the trees
a dark blur
it moves off
the shape appears again
its a small girl roughly arons age
aron waves at her
the girl stares then runs off
aron hurries after her into a wooded grove then stops short
overflows a newly dug trench
the small girl runs to a middle aged man with a crude star of david sewn to his tattered coat
he holds an older girl in his arms
nearby three or four others emerge from hiding
starved in tatters the living waiting to die
where the three brothers gorge themselves on stolen food
someone farts loudly
you know what papa would do when you did that at table
tuvia smacks zus on the head taking on a gruff voice
tuvia imitates his fathers criticism of zus
zus cant help but laugh as well
even in grief there is laughter
a glimpse of ties that bind them
i cant believe papas dead
the police captain
we dont know he did it
he always had it in for papa
we dont know he did it
so we will go and ask him if he did
koscik has a pistol
he showed it to me once
one pistol isnt enough
we need rifles
youre going to take on the whole german army
just because you didnt
the sound of footsteps
zus jumps up cocking the rifle
aron emerges from the trees
and then behind him the survivors he discovered among the corpses
the middle aged man holds a teenage girl by one hand and carries his younger daughter
the child is hurt
the brothers stare at him
wary and unwelcoming
set her down
the man lowers the child to the ground
she isnt moving
i am avram rubinski
this is my daughter
she the germans goldenrod revision
he cannot bring himself to say the words
others shuffle forward still in shock barely able to speak their gratitude as tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese
the man tries to feed his daughter
she is barely alive
asael turns to aron
where did you find them
aron still wont speak
asael addresses the other girl
your sister is sick
they kept her for a week
we fill in the rest
zus has moved out of earshot
tuvia joins him
we cannot feed them
ill go ask koscik for food
and the pistol
and the pistol
without another word he starts off
remember to say please
koscik a rotund florid faced pole hands it to tuvia
i have only four bullets
i cannot thank you enough
they sit in kosciks warmly lit kitchen
kosciks wife stands silently by the stove glaring at tuvia
your father was a good man
he said the same of you
tuvia cant help but notice kosciks wife giving him the evil eye
koscik produces a bottle of vodka
ignore the bitch
raising the bottle to the dead
god rest their souls
in russian subtitles bitch do you want vodka
his wife just glares at him
i live with this can you imagine
headlights sweep over the window
a car is fast approaching
he climbs a ladder and is startled to find five more men and women in hiding
they stare in mute terror
koscik greets a belarussian police captain and his sons as they exit the car
they speak in russian with subtitles working late boys
our new bosses are very organized
koscik offers the bottle
hunting can work up a thirst
fifteen in one day
the council is offering a years free tax for every one you turn in
a jew is worth that much
do you pay more for a fat one
they laugh appreciatively
a man coughs then shrugs an apology
tuvia glares at him
caught five of them hiding in a ditch
smelled so bad i was afraid the germans wouldnt want them
maybe for a reduced price
you know the bielskis
we missed two when we visited the parents
tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parents death
anybody caught helping them is in for it
you know this koscik
do i look like an idiot
dont answer so quickly
the police captain looks at his watch
been at it since dawn
the wife doesnt like these long nights
he tries to hand back the bottle to koscik
bribing an officer of the law
maybe you have more of this black market vodka hidden in the barn
take a look
and clean out the cow shit while youre back there
the policeman laughs and climbs back into the car
youll keep your eyes open yes
koscik and tuvia speak in harsh whispers
if the laborers find them tomorrow i will be denounced what am i supposed to do with take them into the forest and feed them how
i cant care for my own family
behind them several of the refugees have emerged from their hiding place
they stare at tuvia balefully
the refugees are loaded with provisions
a young man pinchas zuckerman has a tethered goat
another man carries a violin case
koscik hands tuvia another bottle of vodka
they were the ones who killed my parents
koscik doesnt want to tell him
finally he nods yes
why is it so fucking hard to be friends with a jew
imagine being one
tuvia leads his motley band toward the woods
tuvia leads them
he notices an old man staring at him
you sat in back
tuvia just looks at him
i am shimon haretz
i thought you were dead
i am at least half dead
after a moment i heard them speaking of your parents
i am very sorry
tuvia shakes his head
and the other brothers
what was his name the wild one
hes with the other two
you are hiding here
in the forest
there has been trouble before maybe
with the police
tuvia doesnt answer
double blue revision
so now you go to the forest
a wise choice
for a dumb schoolboy you mean
my whole life i presumed to teach others the right way to live
i had no doubt this is gods way this isnt
youll forgive me if recent events have somewhat shaken my resolve
it is just like school i dont know what youre talking about
touching him teacher
gesturing to the please
the new arrivals squat by a fire where potatoes are cooking in the ashes
everyone shares from the soup pot
there arent enough spoons to go around
shimon offers aron something to eat
youre not hungry
aron doesnt respond
the little one does not talk
stares fixedly as avram digs his daughters grave
the gun is still in his belt
zus is constructing a shelter
i send you for food and you bring more mouths to feed
you send me
did you at least get the gun
double green revision a
tuvia shows him
only four bullets
then well have to make them count
zus heads for the food
asael is trying to start a fire but the kindling is wet
shimon takes a book from his coat rips out pages covered in hebrew and crumples them into the fire
they burst into flame
the psalms have many uses
watching as they eat hungrily
tuvia stops near avram digging a grave before heading out of the camp
we realize avrams daughter has died while tuvia was away
the sound of distant thunder
double blue revision
tuvia stands in the driving rain shaking
he stares at the lit windows
the police captain we saw earlier eats dinner with his wife and two sons
they speak in russian
you worked late
the man nods his mouth full of food
tomorrow is sunday
you have a day off yes
still chewing nods fucking ss never sleeps
the door opens slowly
they all look up
tuvia stands on the threshold dripping wet a spectral figure
he holds the pistol at his side
you know who i am
the policeman says nothing
his wife is instantly terrified
one of the sons stands
tuvia turns the gun on him
the son obeys
the sound of the rain on the tin roof is deafening
tuvia turns back to the police captain
and you know why i am here
what are you talking about
you have no idea what im talking about
if they say find someone i find him
its my job
to find jews
or lose my job
and its a good job isnt it
you like your job
i was always fair with your family
everyone knew you were smuggling this and that
but i looked the other way
in desperation ask your father
you dont talk about my father
tuvia places the pistol against the mans forehead
down on your knees
double yellow revision
the policeman begins to weep
for my parents david and beila bielski
for my brothers and all the others please
i beg you
one of the mans sons makes a move toward tuvia
tuvia shoots him in the chest
his mother screams
the policeman suddenly starts to stand
tuvia backs away shoots him
and then the other son
it is all over in seconds
the police captains wife is prostrate and keening over her dead family in russian
kill me too
tuvia should indeed kill her too
to avoid being identified
tell them who did this
the rain still pours down on the house as tuvia runs away
tuvia pushes through dense forest
branches rake his face
finally he leans against a tree
we move close on his face
riboynoy shel oylam riboynoy shel oylam
closes his eyes lord of the universe forgive me i have murdered but they were monsters and did not deserve to live
double blue revision
zus awakens sodden and stiff
he looks at the group now numbering fourteen
people sleep huddled together asael holds aron avram keeps his surviving daughter close
and there is tuvia sitting by the fire
zus takes the pistol from tuvias belt
checks the cylinder
only one bullet left
zus nods his approval
how was it
to kill them
it was good no
tuvia stares into the fire
he is dirty and tired
zus looks around
what are we going to do with these others
i dont know the women will slow us down
and your old teacher youre afraid hes going to beat you for forgetting your homework
we have to be able to keep moving and quickly
but theyre here
they consider their predicament
double green revision
well sleep farther up the trail
if anyone comes theyll find them first
the gunshots will give us time to escape
but no more
stumbling into camp behind tuvia who carries a heavy sack of provisions
zus gives tuvia a look
tamara you remember cousin zus
please go sit down by the fire
and this is lazar isabels youngest
tamara is pleasant looking but emotionally wounded
this is isaac malbin
malbin is sweet faced with little round trotsky glasses
asael find them something to eat
zus takes tuvia aside
tuvia i have pity for them all they are family
and how will we feed this family
well water the soup
one of the new arrivals is a dark haired beauty
tuvia and zus watch her pass
zus is particularly interested
and this one is she family
by the fire the veterans pepper the newcomers with double green revision a
double blue revision a
you are from lida
is isadore korein alive
there are so many in the ghetto i dont know
does anyone have news from vilna
double blue revision
food such as it is is being handed out to several new arrivals
asael brushes arons hair
rachel sits beside her grieving father
she looks at aron
he looks back
nearby tuvia and malbin are building a shelter
malbin is hopelessly inept
a wall collapses
have you never used a hammer
what is it you do then
youd have to say
this is a job
i published a small magazine
actually a journal
well more like a pamphlet
zus passes them his arm around the dark haired beauty
tuvia this is rona
rona is my forest wife
zus winks and walks past
malbin and tuvia watch them
as long as his village wife stays in hiding
nice to know there are some things even hitler cant destroy
double blue revision
suddenly the camp grows quiet
two young men who have emerged from the forest their clothes dirty and torn
one of them aims an army issue rifle
hello boys what can we do for you
we want food
everyone remains still
zus eyes his own rifle nearby
these little shits are holding us up
the young man motions his partner to take zuss rifle
you little shits have the balls to shoot me
in response the young man chambers a round
this is all the food we have
you are welcome to share
yellow revision a
i want to see if this little shit will shoot me
you like shooting jews you little shit
you are jews
were the gestapo you little shit
put down your guns
or perhaps youd prefer i shove them up your ass
where are you from
the young man glares at zus
then to tuvia horodyszcze
the name freezes zus in his tracks
his wife is there
we havent eaten in two days
my name is peretz this is jacov
two days ago there were three thousand jews in horodyszcze
now there are fifty
me and him we hid in a wall
you know a woman there sonia bielski
the men look at one another
we knew her
zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question
there was a child
jacov shakes his head
zus leans his head against a tree
after a moment he begins to beat his head against it until blood pours down his face
to the newcomers his family
tuvia puts his arms around his brother
zuss shoulders begin to heave
soon his body convulses with deep wracking sobs
he is absolutely unself conscious in his grief
so many dead
their heads are close together their faces wet with tears
why not us
i dont know
i thought theyd be safe
i should have been with them
i could have protected them
tuvia just holds him
he too is crying quietly
better to be rabbits
zus breaks free of tuvias embrace and walks away
jacov and peretz are eating
between ravenous bites we are looking for partisans
what is the name of your otriad
tuvia laughs ruefully
what is an otriad
an armed brigade
we heard the russians are beginning to organize
and also in the lipicanska
then we are the bielski otriad
you want to join
looks around the russians are fighters
but you need a gun to join them
without a gun you are nothing
they sabotage railroads and kill germans
we will kill all the germans you can handle
they stare up at him his face a mask of blood and filth
if youre not afraid to use that rifle
zus is loading wilenckis gun
we must get what we need without killing
we cant make more enemies zus concentrates on opening the breach
it wont bring your family back to life
blood for blood
you had your revenge
and i can still see their faces
vengeance is mine
who said that
so this is gods work youre doing zussie
only you can play god
save a few lives take a few others
we cannot become
a hard look are you coming with us or not
peretz and jacov
tuvia looks over at asael who looks away
to zus you are making the decisions now
a stand off
zus stares back at him
the struggle for command has grown more obvious
we wait for dark
lights up the night sky
a man comes running out of a tavern the same man who loaded jews onto trucks in an earlier scene
who did this to my truck
tuvia zus and the others appear out the shadows
the man stops short at the sight of their weapons
who are you
you dont understand
they made me give them my truck
jacov and peretz follow suit
the man goes down
they throw his dead body onto the burning truck
zus and peretz are backing out of an open doorway firing back inside as they go
from within the sound of screams
faces appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses
zus addresses the little neighborhood delirious with joy
tuvia looks around warily
this is getting out of hand
tuvia and asael lie in on one side of a road
tuvia has looped one end of the wire around a post
zus peretz and jacov wrap the wire to a tree
the lights of a motorcycle a german courier
tuvia waits until the bike is almost upon them
then he tightens the wire so it stretches invisibly across the road
by the wire
his bike goes sliding away as the bielskis swarm him killing him with the last bullet from the mahkarov
zus rummages through the downed bikes saddlebags
he finds a beautiful knife and lifts it up triumphantly
more headlights fast approaching
they all scramble back into the ditch dragging the dead courier with them
as its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle it slows and pulls off to the side where tuvia and zus are concealed
from within the car we hear voices speaking german
a young private gets out and walks up the road to investigate
in german subtitled its one of ours but no one is here
maybe he was drunk
from the car an sergeant yells a reply
in german subtitled move it off the road before the convoy passes
ill report the sonuvabitch
as the soldier drags the bike off the road an officer steps out of the car and lights a cigarette
hes followed by the sergeant
he carries a schmeisser submachine gun dangling from his shoulder
can see the sergeants feet peeking out over the ditch
cascades onto him
he tries to inch his body away
catches the flicker of movement below sees zus lying in the ditch
stunned he tries to zip up his fly
zus leaps up brandishing the knife
hes on the sergeant before he can get the gun off his shoulder
stabbing him through his greatcoat the blade breaks off in his hand
meanwhile the lieutenant drops his cigarette reaching under his coat for a pistol
tuvia tackles him
the gun skids away
they roll around on the road clawing punching biting
tuvia slams the mans head against the pavement
the private sees asael and peretz coming at him
jacov follows with his rifle
the private turns and runs down the road
they give chase
another officer is in the back seat with a woman
he reaches for his gun stands up in the seat and begins firing wildly at tuvia
tuvia rolls under the car avoiding the burst
meanwhile zus uses the handle of the knife to break the sergeants nose
he rips the schmeisser away firing point blank into the man whose greatcoat catches fire
the officer takes close aim at tuvia just as zus turns the machine gun on the car blowing out the windows killing the officer and the woman and saving his
jacov fires at the private misses
the man keeps running
jacov fires again
finally his third shot hits him in the leg
the private keeps running
i got him
peretz and asael can now catch up to the soldier
we see them knock the private to the ground kicking him until jacov catches up to them and fires a final shot
tuvia stands out of breath
the gunfire could be heard for miles
he was pissing on my head
zus is high from the killing covered in the dead mans blood
he begins calling out orders
peretz jacov check the car for guns
to tuvia this ones yours
he presents him with the schmeisser as if it were a trophy
tuvia accepts it checking the gun efficiently
ill check his pockets for more ammo
peretz and jacov emerge with two machine pistols several bottles of schnapps and a beautiful leica camera
they were on their way to a party
they toss one bottle to zus and another to tuvia
asael stands over the dead private
he isnt much older than aron
zus rifles the pockets of the dead sergeant for ammo
he finds cigarettes and the mans wallet
he opens it
welcome to belarus herr henkel
a champagne cork pops as peretz and jacov toast their victory
now we are real partisans
to the bielski otriad
are rounding the bend
the staff car was leading a convoy
into the fields
tuvia pulls peretz off the road but jacov reloads his rifle and begins to fire at the approaching trucks
the trucks stop
troops pour off and begin returning fire
jacov is cut down by a machine gun
peretz zus and tuvia race into the wheat field
its not clear if they can make it into the woods
a flare ignites overhead turning the wheat fields bright white in flickering incandescence
malbin is almost paralytic with fear
asael doesnt know which way to run
he plunges into the wheat field
but on the wrong side of the road
one of the trucks drives forward cutting him off using its spotlight to reveal him
fifteen soldiers start after him
we watch as they converge on him
have almost made it into the woods when peretz is hit
tuvia and zus pick him up and half carry half drag him into the sanctuary of the forest
zus races back to pick up peretzs weapon
has realized his mistake
he tries to circle back toward the woods but the soldiers move to cut him off
he is fast but not fast enough
we realize he isnt going to make it
tuvia and zus look at the scene with mounting horror
double pink revision
he rips the rifle from zuss hands
for a moment we think hes going to go back after him
instead he wedges the rifle into a tree trunk and takes careful aim
plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out
asael seizes the moment and dives to his knees disappearing from view and crawling now rather than expose himself
an irrigation ditch is nearby
frantically he digs into the soft mud on its banks
as he scrapes his hands raw he can hear his pursuers drawing near calling out to one another
a somber mood
tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge congealed in an empty pot
others stare listlessly into space
one man chews on a piece of leather another sucks on an old chicken bone
zus meanwhile is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the captured schnapps
nearby aron shares his ration of bread with rachel
little enough but a connection is made
peretz lies nearby
malbin is trying to comforts him
there is nothing that can help him
malbin looks to tuvia
they thought you were bringing food
tuvia just stares at him
did the farmers stop you
still no answer from tuvia
they had guns
i dont understand
tuvia says nothing
nearby a child cries in hunger
the talmud says if you save a life you must take responsibility for it
double pink revision a
again i have no idea what you are talking about
around them the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces
i think you do
you are the bielskis
a man stands in the clearing
ben zion gulkowitz is tall well muscled a rifle strapped over his shoulder
howd you get past the lazar
zus stands unsteadily then lurches into the woods leaning on an occasional tree for support
he finds the erstwhile sentry lazar ambling toward him
you worthless shit
zus punches him knocking him the ground
in a sloppy drunken frenzy zus slaps him again
he walked right by you
someone could have been killed
tuvia pulls zus off him
i said enough
to lazar get up
if we were real partisans hed be shot
he made a mistake
double pink revision
we cannot make mistakes
as zus goes for lazar again tuvia roughly pulls him off
zus goes flying tripping over landing on his ass
thats right zus
like last night
looks at him first they will torture asael
and then they will hang him
tuvia walks away leaving his brother on the ground
tuvia rejoins them
ben zion looks up at him
you are tuvia bielski
you know me
i am ben zion gulkowitz
ben zion is besieged by questions about friends and family
pardon me you are from vilna
my sister lives on passaya street
the sd came without warning
hundreds were taken
no one knows where
double pink revision
the woman begins to cry
my poor sister
dear god no
meanwhile peretzs moaning ceases
a woman grumbles wed be better off in the ghetto
at least here we are safe
there at least we had hope
here we have hope
a few more join in grumbling their dissatisfaction
others take the opposite position
these are jews after all and arguing is a revered sport and a pastime
we are hungry
this is a defining moment for tuvia
when at first he speaks it is awkward ineffectual amid the growing tumult
i know we have no food
tomorrow will be another mission
look what happened the last time
that was a mistake
but the mistakes we made will not be made again
tuvia must raise his voice to be heard
we could be here a long time
and we have to prepare
better at getting food and information talking over their at making shelters
whatever is needed
we all participate
we dont work against each other
at this he looks directly at zus
daring him to object
double pink revision a
i want to kill nazis too but we
cannot afford revenge
not right now
we cannot afford to lose friends like jacov and peretz
a small voice speaks up
it is the first time aron has spoken
double pink revision
we trying to hold it cannot lose anyone
he looks from face to face
filthy ravaged many of them with tears in their eyes
this is what they need leadership faith something to believe in
and gradually his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced by something else
a new voice
from deep inside
we will map out where weve been so as to not visit the same farms too often
and we take only from those who can afford to give and leave those who cant alone
the poorest farmer has more than us
but what i am saying is
what i mean is
we are not thieves
his resolve growing with every word or murderers
we may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals
looks at them all we have all chosen this to live free like human beings for as long as we can
each day of freedom is an act of faith
and if we die trying to live at least we die like human beings
his mission statement
a vision of their future
everyone nods in mute acknowledgement
zus lowers his head
the shift in power between them has occurred
tuvia has emerged as the undisputed leader
the trees take on color as if in celebration of their coming together
all is quiet as tuvia zus and ben zion watch from the woods
they leave their cover and approach warily guns at the ready
kosciks wife looks up from her garden and glares at them
she refuses to be flattered
in russian in the barn
zus calls out
koscik put your pants back on and leave those sheep alone
he steps into the shadows to find that has been driven through his chest
a sign attached to the hook reads in polish jew lover
is just beyond the barn
tuvia finishes piling on the last shovelful of earth
kosciks wife stares straight ahead
a monotone come
dug into a hillside
overgrown with tall grass it is undetectable
kosciks wife opens the heavy door revealing asael who emerges blinking into the bright light
double pink revision
zus pulls his lost brother into a mighty embrace
i cant breathe
zus lets him go and asael reaches back into the root cellar
two lovely young women bella and chaya emerge tentative and scared
though their dresses are dirty it is obvious they were once expensive
zus eyes them appreciatively
look at this he has two more rifles and a large box of ammunition
tuvia turns to kosciks wife deeply moved
turning away go
they head for home
zus walks beside bella
and then we fell into this horrible bog
chaya saved me
honestly i cant swim at all
double yellow revision
then i will teach you
we must have got lost a dozen times
i was absolutely resigned to die
tell him chaya
was it not the absolute worst
and that farmer mr
koscik kept making the most vulgar jokes he said any girl who as they continue out of earshot it appears as though zus would be happy to listen for hours
aron and rachel are walking through the woods
for a brief moment viewed through the eyes of the young we see these woods as a magical place
strange mushrooms gnarled roots an enormous spiders web glistening with dew
sentries are posted
zus expertly helps with the building a bunker zemylanka
theres a more permanent kitchen a wash trough a clothesline
pinchas tends his goat
though primitive and raw
their bickering will become for them as time goes on a sport and a pastime
youre trying to tell me all politics is meaningless
in the west a monster with a little mustache in the east a monster with a big mustache
this is all i need to know about politics
your messiah will have a mustache too and a full beard
the messiahs are all in politics and theyre killing us
zus unloads two cut and stripped trees

asael smiles embarrassed

i hardly know her

asael blushes returns the focus to their prior conversation
malbin says the piznarksi granary is full
we need two guns at least
whose turn to go

double yellow revision a a
asael heads toward chaya
we notice a few new faces
their number has exceeded twenty
among them are two lumbering dark skinned men arkady and motl lubczanski
ben zion is showing lazar and the other newcomers how to clean a weapon
this is not a gun
it is bar kochbas spear
it is ehuds sword
you fix the patch to the rod they do as he instructs
then run it through the barrel
and dont lose the patch in the lazar looks up sheepishly
i lost my patch
arkady lubczanski whispers contemptuously to his brother the village idiot
zus shoves arkady out of the way and approaches lazar who cowers
but rather than abuse him zus removes the patch from the rifle and hands it back to him
thank you zus
returning the rifle its nothing
double yellow revision
kissely is a milkman with bright red hair and a bushy mustache
he leads a horse drawn cart laden with milk cans
zus and the others rise up out of the ditch
in russian a pleasant tone good morning friend
getting an early start to market
could you possibly spare us a bit of milk
zus tone is belied by the rifle in his hand
this is what im required to give the germans
if i dont meet my quota theyll shoot me and my family
zus is tempted to shoot him himself
to zus leave half
he cant go to the germans empty handed
zus glares at asael
zus shakes his head climbs onto the wagon and begins removing cartons
double pink revision
to the milkman we are so grateful comrade for your cooperation
what a lovely coat
is that a fur collar
joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path
zus shakes his head
lazar stands pointing his weapon
lazar you can see its us you idiot
you only ask who goes there when you dont know who it is
is a beehive of activity
shimon and malbin are digging
even spinoza said existence can be substantiated by empirical evidence
all your secular learning yet you know nothing of life
how can you say this
learning is my life
and for every fact that goes in your head another comes out your rear end
chaya and bella receive the bounty from the foragers
milk eggs chaya our brave men have brought us a feast
you will make me blintzes
she bestows her best smile upon him
new arrivals are being shown around by ben zion

smiles at her i couldnt help but notice you dont have a husband yet
somewhat taken aback yet
cherry revision a
most of the woman have already chosen
they havent told you about this
double yellow revision
but thank you for explaining it
she hurries away
malbin sits down wearily beside shimon
descartes at least provided for the subjective nature of experience
he takes a spoon from his sock
you annoy me therefore i exist
you are not eating
by my best calculation today is high holiday
i am fasting
malbin cant believe this
he rolls his eyes and digs in
one of the newcomers has brought a violin
he begins to play
a bittersweet melody
people stop talking and listen eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter civilized time
ben zion has left the new arrivals and approached tuvia
he looks grave
tuvia immediately knows something is wrong
what is it
the new ones they are from novagroduk
your wife tuvia tenses
ben zion hesitates
she was killed last week
at a loss im sorry
no outward display of grief
an awkward moment
thank you for telling me
changes the subject we have to dig a trench around the new zemylanka
if it rains im afraid water will seep in
tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news
ill see to it then
tuvia nods and walks away
cathedral light cuts through the trees forming visible shafts
like in his dream
asael says you can see the angels
they walk on eventually coming upon railroad tracks
a train is rounding the bend headed in their direction
can we stay to watch
if we hide
they move back into the trees as the train nears a slow moving engine pulling a line of wooden cattle cars
is that a nazi train
if we had some dynamite we could blow the shit out of it
with undisguised just like your brothers
aron cant help but be pleased by this notion
then as the train passes they can see hands gripping the small barred windows
and every now and then a gaunt desperate face
they stare in astonishment
tuvia sits alone
outside the sound of the violin continues
shimon comes to sit beside him
i am sorry for your loss
he is deep inside himself
do you want to say the kaddish
when at last tuvia speaks it is almost to himself
she was a beautiful woman
not a day went by she didnt remind me i wasnt a good provider
for years it wasnt really a marriage at all
he lowers his head
all shimon can do is sit beside him
bella takes chaya aside
you have lipstick
please i know you have some left
chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant
bella dabs it on and casually approaches zus who is on guard duty
may i join you
you get lonely out here
i like the woods
laughter and music waft through the trees
im a little scared out here
zus knows an opportunity when he sees one
he offers her a drink from his bottle of vodka
ive never tried it
she drinks refuses to grimace
bella touches the rifle in his arms
why is there a rule against women having guns
there arent enough for the men
women need guns too
women have men for protection
bella bites her lip
shes a virgin but also realistic
i want protection
she steps closer and takes zuss hand
under her coat
onto her breast
never taking her eyes off him
you will take good care of me
you will be my commander
aron and rachel are walking back from the train tracks
suddenly he senses movement freezes armed policemen are advancing through the trees
aron and rachel bury themselves beneath piles of leaves until the police pass by then he grabs her hand and dashes aron runs through the woods like a deer

he bursts in screaming
people panic search for family members grab whatever they can carry zus and bella emerge from the woods where they have lain together for the first time
he grabs his rifle
tuvia tries to maintain order
asael clutches chayas hand
rounding up others
the policemen begin firing
two of the group are killed
tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods
lova ben zion stay with us
asael keep them moving

this way tuvia and zus usher the group across the river and up the embankment

tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while the others escape
the policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin crossing the river
shots rings out
a policeman goes down
the german soldier is shot in the leg
they are dragged from the water
double yellow revision a
an edgy silence
from the trees a voice calls out in russian double yellow revision
the policemen exchange apprehensive looks
the confrontation changes languages
derisive laughter from the trees
give us bielski and the rest of you can go free
behind a tree tuvia is surprised by the mention of his name
you are from belarussia pig
why do you work for the germans against your own people
for the same reason you steal from the poor
another shot rings out
kessely is hit in the arm
next one is to the head
double yellow revision
soon it will be dark
see how you find your way home then
the policemen are having similar thoughts
soon its a full scale retreat
tuvia zus lova ben zion emerge
zus picks up the dead germans machine pistol
theyll be back
looks around we have to find a new camp
next time just draw them a map
what does that mean
it means we should have killed the fucking milkman
your policy of diplomacy is shit
zus is breathing hard full of the adrenaline of battle
two are dead
winter is coming and now we have no shelter
because you dont have the stomach to do what must be done
he walks away
double yellow revision
as the group trudges along weighed down by cooking gear food guns etc
asael takes the iron cauldron from chaya
zus and bella walk side by side
pinchas leads his goat
where is he taking us
my feet are going to fall off
a great rabbi once said wherever i go i am always going to the land of israel
well maybe rabbis should give better directions
tuvia walks alongside but apart
the group is sprawled on the ground
four people share a single cigarette
shimon and malbin hardly have the energy to argue
pinchas feeds his goat
tuvia walks among them
rest and eat
i need volunteers for a scouting party
zus raises his hand
tuvia nods in grudging gratitude
however mixed his feelings zus can always be counted on
tuvia looks at zus who shrugs
they are in unfamiliar territory
as they move cautiously forward steps into the path holding an automatic rifle
he whistles softly
more armed men materialize surrounding them
in russian subtitles tuvia instantly grasps the situation
in russian subtitles a brigade of independent fighters searching for our comrades
cherry revision a
zus almost does a double take at tuvias bluff
we belong to the bielski otriad
we know of you
zuss finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun
ill take the two on the left
tuvia maintains his composure
im sure we can clear up this misunderstanding with your commander
a primitive tent camp
russian partisans move about quiet and cold eyed men wearing remnants of red army uniforms
zus cant help but be impressed by the array of weaponry
victor pachenko emerges from a tent
a former lieutenant dashing in a fur cap and long officers coat
he addresses them in russian
i am viktor panchenko commander of the october otriad
we have had complaints of a jewish gang stealing from villages loyal to us
a steely look how do you respond to these charges
when you take food it is from loyal supporters
when we do you call it stealing
we are soldiers
and we fight a common enemy
the motherland doesnt distinguish between jews and non jews
viktor is amused by this bit of soviet dogma
but jews do not fight
double green revision
these jews do
viktor appraises tuvia for a moment
we will see
select your best fighters and send them to us
zus looks at tuvia knowing he has no choice
we are honored to be of service
tuvia and zus salute and head back the way they came
under his breath so were partisans now
as if we have a choice
has taken root
people hard at work building zemylanka
tuvia and malbin are working together on a new bunker
malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway
throwing a smaller here
if my friends at the new socialists club could see me now
shakes his head i havent read a book in months
i havent read one in years
malbin looks up from his work
i wasnt a very good student
you can ask shimon
tuvia laughs ruefully
considers him for a moment
yet you accept me as commander
double goldenrod revision
malbin thinks about it for a moment
they continue working
might i make an observation
tuvia gestures go ahead
we need to be strong but but
other things are important too
malbin tries to think how best to put it
tuvia considers the word
as if trying it on for size
you have more ideas
about all this
more mouths to feed
more young bodies to keep us warm
one ot them a young man yitzhak shulman rips the yellow star of david off his coat and kneels to kiss the ground
which one is tuvia bielski
someone points tuvia out
shulman hurries over and kisses tuvias hand
zus is drinking nearby with his cronies
double goldenrod revision a
none of us knew if you really existed

chaya bursts into tears
asael puts his arm around her
my parents zus catches tuvias glance to malbin
tuvia turns back to shulman
well do what we can
double goldenrod revision
shulman tries to kiss tuvias hand once again but tuvia takes his hand instead and shakes it
chaya looks deeply into asaels eyes
you will help my parents
ive seen you looking at me
if you were to rescue them i would do
you asael is completely undone by the starkness of this
i mean yes
and grabs him as he walks away
their hushed tones belie the growing chasm between them
and what exactly does that mean do what we can
we must send for whoever is left alive
and if it is a hundred
then we will provide
and when the germans follow these hundreds and slaughter us
i wont let that happen
tuvia exchanges a glance with malbin
zus catches it
he has sensed malbins growing influence
you wont let that happen
ill bring them out myself
from the ghetto
allow me to kiss your hand
tuvia tries to pull his hand away but zus holds him
you think pachenko wants hundreds more of us in the forest
i cannot have you contradicting me
not when others are around
looks around our family must stick together
and who is it thats risking our family and for what
for the sake of these gestures at the new malbushim
dont call them that
thats who comes to us from the ghetto
they are people
jews who stuck up their noses and wouldnt give us the time of day when we passed them on the street
jews who went out of their way to keep their daughters locked away from our dirty hands
you think your old teacher will give you a good grade because you saved his worthless ass
they accept you as their leader only because they are too weak and full of shit to help themselves
what about bella
tuvia looks over at bella who is anxiously watching
you think shed be with you if it wasnt for what is happening here
zus glares at him but tries to control himself
is it love zus
double salmon revision
zus is sick of talk
he punches tuvia in the face
tuvia is rocked but still he goads his brother
you are the man of her dreams
the romeo of novagrudok
zus cant take anymore
he charges tuvia who sidesteps and slams him in the gut
all the frustration of the past months not to mention years of sibling rivalry translates into fists and elbows
ben zion moves to break it up
tuvia and zus turn on him
is this your business
zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of tuvia
finally in desperation tuvia rolls away and picks up a rock
he is about to slam it into his brothers head when suddenly he stops himself
the two brothers look at each other both breathing heavily realizing that they have crossed some line
calls out ben zion
to tuvia we are going to join the real partisans
he looks at asael
are you coming
asael looks at one brother then the other
once again he is in the middle
he looks at chaya then back at zus
ill dance at your wedding
he stops by bellas side touches her arm then disappears down the trail
the others follow
tuvia and asael feel naked outside the safety of the forest
in the distance the city looms
tuvia and asael pass by the barbed wire and machine guns of the guards and dogs manning the barrier to the ghetto

that might once have been home to a family of four now houses fifteen
tuvia and asael are deep in conversation with several elders of the ghetto council we are not so naive as to believe they wont kill some of us
but all the jews
it makes no sense
they need us to work
in the factories
the labor camps
tuvia notices a pretty girl standing on a chair in order to hear
her name is lilka and we will soon come to know her
there are rumors
of death camps
we too have heard of such places
but have you seen them yourself
can you tell me with absolute certainty that we are not just as likely to die out there with you in the woods with winter coming on
someone whistles from the street below
a tense moment
do you think we havent all considered running away
for every one that leaves they kill twenty
how can i sacrifice thousands for the sake of a few
tuvia looks at them rubbing his face in concentration
what if we were to take all of you
the old the sick
there are thousands
how will we live
we will protect you
we have made alliances with the russian partisans
they are as bad as the nazis
you are too young to know the pogroms double green revision a
tuvia slams his fist on a table
you want time
fine i give you a day
maybe a year
to an older couple your daughter is out there with us
to another woman your husband is waiting for you
an old orthodox rabbi stands nearby
are waiting for god
tuvia looks at him in disbelief
such madness is incontrovertible
a suspended moment
i am going
this breaks the log jam
several others join in we are coming us too etc
tuvia nods his acknowledgment
a crude tunnel has been dug through a ghetto wall
people squeeze through into the adjoining alley
behind them a hundred more await their turn
out in the alley asael stops them momentarily as a car goes by at the end of the street then gives the all clear
tuvia takes lilka hand and helps her pass through
their eyes meet for just a moment

she holds asaels arm and looks up at him with absolute rapture
she is his
malbin is collecting valuables
one well dressed woman is reluctant to part with her jewelry

and now they belong to the otriad
everyone sacrifices for the sake of the collective
we can trade these for food or weapons
nearby shimon is interviewing another line of arrivals
how about carpenters
i am an accountant
that should come in handy
i am a nurse
and you tateh
oppenheim is an old man with thick glasses
i am a watchmaker
tuvia has walked over to observe
can you repair guns
hands him a rifle see if you can fix this trigger
oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the mechanism
he digs into his pocket and produces a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur
he tests it then hands it back to tuvia who clicks the trigger
you have a new profession
a murmur of appreciation ripples through the group as shulman appears leading a magnificent white horse
double goldenrod revision
look what we found running free
must have belonged to an aristocrat
my god shes beautiful

he mounts her easily urges her around the perimeter greeting the new arrivals
heads turn as he trots past
he is the center of attention and he knows it
and likes it
friends we are happy to see you safely among us
but there are many things you must learn about living here
all attention turns to him
the lubczanski brothers grumble to each other none too pleased with tuvias show boating
once you are settled youll be assigned work duties
everyone works no exceptions
of people being introduced to various tasks shoemaking sewing cooking
asael teaching them to use guns
we will help supply the russian partisans by making clothes repairing guns
malbin catches his eye and winks clearly this has been part of their strategy discussions
women will learn to use weapons and fight alongside men
tuvia takes a rifle from asael and holds it aloft
this is not a gun
it is bar kochbas spear
it is ehuds sword
you will all learn to protect yourselves
a little boy holds lilkas hand and looks up at tuvia in wonder
he cuts an iconic figure

tuvia nods you are a hero
she vigorously shakes tuvias hand and walks away
tuvia catches his reflection in the water
and likes it
lilka awakens to find ten women wedged in beside her back to front like spoons
idly she begins to itch her scalp
then her leg
in the pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice
the women around her wake up terrified
get them off
get them off me
lice need somewhere to sleep too
the others laugh but lilka is on the verge of hysteria
she stumbles out stepping on several others as she goes
crying she tears at her clothes only to discover tuvia and others staring at her with interest
she is mortified
the women wash clothes in the stream
lilka is by the riverbank scrubbing furiously
tamara works beside her

oh take me to that dream
i was dreaming of shoes
there was a man in a shop on grudek street
and the way he caressed my feet when i tried on his shoes
the women burst into ribald laughter
the sound of a horse
they look to the opposite bank where tuvia rides by on his horse
lilka cant help but stare
doesnt take a fortune teller to know what lilkas dreaming about
lilka blushes furiously
the women laugh even louder
gramov shows zus how to plant a disk like contact mine

you and i double green revision a
asael and chaya are getting married
a light snow is falling as they say repeat their vows as shimon instructs
their breath condenses in the cold
behold thou art consecrated unto me by this ring according to the laws of moses and israel
but rather than a ring asael gives her a shiny new rifle
as the ceremony continues we zus ben zion and several bielski fighters hide alongside ten russian partisans as a german troop truck approaches
pachenko watches as zus follows the approaching truck through binoculars then cocks the heavy machine gun
the truck slows to a crawl as it encounters an overturned peasant cart blocking the road
as asael kisses the bride tuvia is staring not at the newlyweds but rather at lilka who has washed and let down her hair
she glances up and meets his eye then looks away
as asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot the driver slumps over the wheel and the truck careens lazily off the road
german soldiers spill out blindly returning fire as zuss fighters swarm down the hill
several are hit right away

they pass aron and rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by adding a german helmet with a bullet hole in it
asael shows tuvia the last few potatoes
there is talk of returning to the ghetto
theyve barely eaten in days
even when our food missions manage to get through there are armed patrols
farmers who once helped us now guard their barns with shotguns
tuvia considers for a moment

and bring shotguns
tuvia sets off
in every face he passes theres misery and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue lips
children stare at him with sunken haunted eyes
tuvia visits his beautiful horse
he unties him

no sign of the food mission
tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods
lilka and shulman are walking backwards retracing their steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow
we mustnt have any tracks leading back to base
he loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders
stay on this side of the creek until you reach the river then up the hill

lazar is dragging a wounded man back into camp
bring him to the infirmary
tuvia glances back toward the woods
looks at his watch
shulman will look after her
he looks up
she looks at him sympathetically
apparently his interest in lilka isn quite as secret as he imagines
exhausted cold and alone lilka is becoming increasingly disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks double salmon revision a
she turns in a circle trying to decide which way to go
a mangy dog appears out of nowhere its coat matted its ribs showing a wild look in its eye
it growls ferociously
shoo shoo double cherry revision
but the dog as ravenous as she smells the food and wont back down
it inches forward foaming at the mouth
lilka tries to step back but the dog lunges snapping its jaws
she looks desperately for help
suddenly the dog leaps at her
she turns away and it rips a sack from her shoulder knocking her down
viciously it begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within
a shot rings out
the dog drops
lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands
grimly she pockets the weapon picks up the sack of food and starts off
reconsidering she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto her shoulder too
riva bandages edjelmans head
tuvia looks at all the sick
whats wrong with them all

the partisans have ampicillin
but they say they need it for themselves
in the background lilka enters face scratched blood smeared hands and arms like some kind of primitive huntress
sees he is distracted tuvia
medicine for typhus
i heard you
ill go see viktor right away
on his way out he passes lilka who is being looked after
are you all right
handing him the gun thank you
tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken but he has no time to ask more
he has to find out about the medicine
i must go
viktor gramov and zus are poring over a map of the area
and every time we try to move they radio back to police hq which houses the transmitter
so we attack the transmitter
yes yes my hebrew warrior
except for the troops in stankiewcze and the machine guns out front
the tent flap opens
he has developed a cough
two bielskis in one room
to what do we owe this honor
we have sickness
i need ampicillin
this medicine is reserved for fighters
if typhus breaks out in our camp it may spread to yours
i will have to take that chance
zus looks from one immovable force to the other
i must insist
youd better not
zus is watching this dick measuring with keen interest
there would be medicine in the police headquarters at stankiewcze yes
he looks to gramov who looks to viktor who nods
tuvia and i grew up there
looks at tuvia perhaps the bielski otriad will volunteer to take out the transmitter
viktor looks from zus to tuvia
zus grabs his submachine gun
krensky ben zion
is quiet at midnight on this snowy evening
tuvia and zus sit in the cab of an old truck its exhaust sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night
he looks into the back where the others wait anxiously clutching their weapons
tuvia tries to hold back a cough
stay with the truck
and make sure its in gear when we get back
im going in with you
i give the orders tonight
across the square the police station looms
you dont have to do this
a bitter laugh what about the typhus
so more die
they will anyway
a grim smile from zus
tuvia is broken up inside
i have been given this mission by my superior officer
he starts to get out the cab
tuvia reaches into his pocket takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents home
hands him the mezuzah for luck
zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the shadows
but rather than follow them into the police station we hold on tuvias face
suddenly we hear the sound of gunfire
it is excruciating
the longest close up in film history
ben zion bursts in and opens fire killing two policemen
krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter
a policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots krensky in the back
ben zion whirls and kills him
zus meanwhile rummages cabinets looking for ampicillin
in the back room zus keeps rummaging
a window explodes
ben zion is hit
mortally wounded he sinks to his knees returning fire as zus reappears
as zus bursts out the door
he races to the truck and struggles into the passenger seat bleeding from his go
what about the others
pink revision a
from his coat zus takes out a blood soaked package
double cherry revision
fighters die so that malbushim may live thats what you believe yes
tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch
so youre a communist now zus
zus lays his head back on the seat closes his eyes
communist zionist manicurist what difference does it make
you got your medicine
come back to us
zus wont look at him
you are my brother
so you remember
for ben zion and krensky
shimon addresses the group
merciful god we commit our friends ben zion and krensky to your care
we have no more prayers no more tears
we have run out of blood
choose another people we pan past the familiar faces
we have paid for each of your commandments
we have covered every field and stone with ashes
sanctify another land
looks at them choose another people
teach them the deeds and the prophecies
grant us but one more blessing take back the gift of our holiness
tuvia is still drinking heavily
he is coughing steadily his face sweaty with fever
the sound of angry voices from outside the bunker
arkady lubczanski has pulled a knife on asael who backs away stumbling into a group of bystanders
next time i cut off your nose pisher
tuvia emerges from his bunker
he is weaving a bit and his words are slurred
whassa problem arkady
those who risk their lives to bring back food deserve a larger portion than those who risk nothing
everyone gets the same portion
not when youre serving pisher
i see you digging to the bottom of the pot for your little forest cutie and her parents
she is my wife
same for all
if someone is stealing hell face consequences
asael is astonished that tuvia would go against him in public and embarrassed by his public drunkenness
others are closely watching this test of tuvias authority
reduced rations for one week
a beat both of you
in his face arkady is tempted to take him on
but he backs down
raises his voice this matter is settled
everybody back in line
people are staring at him
his eyes meet lilkas
she looks away
asael takes tuvias arm and pulls him aside
tuvia i would never yes
then why am i to be punished
tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle
fischer is with them
so is levine
on food missions they take first for themselves and only bring back whats left over tuvias head is throbbing
he closes his eyes
and they spread rumors that you are power hungry and corrupt that you take whatever woman you choose tuvia cant help but laugh that we keep gold for ourselves and
that he stops himself
that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us
maybe theyre right
asael looks at him
no longer the brother he once idealized
zus would have punched him senseless
i miss him
he has made his choice
he reels away toward the woods
tuvia is lying in his bunker vomiting and burning up with fever
shimon has brought him soup
from the bottom of the pot
tuvia can barely get the soup down
the way they look at me
with their pasty faces
let them starve were all going to die out here anyway
not easy being the big boss
moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage
so im a sucker for a biblical allusion
but what is society without leaders
without leaders we falter
double cherry revision a
i am not a leader
neither was moses but somehow that seemed to work out
several partisans are singing a drinking song while zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket
lova walks in
his face is black and blue
lova what happened
who did this
lova sits and buries his head in his hands
i used the officers latrine
for this they beat you
lova is trying not to weep
they said they wouldnt shit in the same hole as a jew
zus gets to his feet
zus bursts in to find panchenko deep in conversation with gramov and others
they look up at the intrusion
forgive me commander
he offers him a glass of vodka
zus doesnt take it
i want to report the mistreatment of a comrade
gramov looks up
zus meets his eye
double goldenrod revision b
this man beat comrade lova for no reason at all
i had a perfectly good reason
he is a jew
the other men laugh
panchenko frowns at gramov
and you are an ignorant tartar
offers zus vodka ignore him
anti semitism is a violation of party discipline
does he really have to deal with this
hes right gramov
apologize to the jew
i apologize jew
a command now drink up
zus doesnt know what to do
he accepts the vodka
guards ring the snowy perimeter
as it swims into focus
tuvia opens his eyes
it is lilka
she sits beside him mopping his forehead with a cool rag
your fever broke in the night
the medicine helped
how long was i asleep
salmon revision c
and youve nursed me the whole time
did you study nursing at university
we devoted ourselves to more essential knowledge like greek philosophy and latin
i never went to university
what kind of work did you do
my wifes father had a store
before the race laws
looks at her she is is dead
tell me more about university
it all feels like a dream
i spent months trying to master chopins nocturnes
id love to hear you play
you know chopin
chopin the butcher from novogrudok
if youre well enough to tease me youre well enough to eat
ill see whats for supper
she gets up to go
thank you lilka
the lubczanskis have taken the fullest advantage of tuvias illness
there are now two lines of people waiting for food
the malbushim line up like prison inmates
lazar looks into his bowl two beans floating in a scummy broth
motl arkady fischer levine and a few others are enjoying real food
lazar calls out from the other line
double cherry revision
hey arkady this isnt soup its piss
i will piss on your head and you will say its raining
the rest of lubczanskis cabal laughs
tuvia emerges from his bunker
the first thing he sees is asael whose face is battered and swollen
asael just looks over at the food line where arkady has grabbed chaya by the waist to the delight of the others
tuvia strides over to them
what is this
fighters get better food
against my orders
you are no longer commander
tuvia nods considering his remark for a moment
he then turns the gun on motl and the others they literally cower in fear
he raises his voice to those watching
as long as i am the leader of this group you will obey my commands
the rest work
every morning we get up and we work
in the snow and the cold and the dark
tomorrow we begin to build ten new zemylanka we double the number of food missions
looks down at arkady take his body into the woods and leave it for the wolves
he turns and walks away
as he passes the food lines people subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone
double cherry revision a
whereas once he was greeted warmly by all now his isolation is complete
he is the commander
double cherry revision
tripping over roots and finally leaning against a tree he is mumbling almost incoherent part prayer part profanity
struggles through patches of snow
ice drips from branches
takes a group portrait
the forest is green again
on the womens bodies as they bathe in the river
who has the soap
i know there was a little left
use the sand
its good for your skin
and what skin
and already married too
chaya splashes her playfully with water
ive turned into a skeleton
and you were always so worried about staying slim
when we get out of this forest i am going to eat only cake and grow as big as a house
shes wearing a long overcoat
at least the sun is warm
tamara turns away lilka joins her tamara
i cant lilka
lowers her voice im pregnant
double salmon revision a
i had no idea
ive kept it hidden for months but now its obvious
no one can know
they move away from the others
tamara shows her
it could come any day
double cherry revision
who is the father
i it was when i was escaping
a man with a gun stopped me
i thought he was a partisan
he told me to follow him and he took me to this place
the memory overwhelms her
she begins to break down
inside me something broke
i wanted to die
every night i have nightmares what will happen when tuvia finds out
he will understand
you mustnt tell him
touches her arm what are you going to do
tamaras eyes fill with a new resolve
i feel this new life inside me
its the only thing keeping me going
i wont give it up ill kill myself
lilka puts her arm around her
from his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits
he hears a sound
three german soldiers are putting camouflage on their helmets
beyond a german armored column
the assault is coming
where shimon and malbin are playing chess
shimon has developed a bad cough
you call that a move
i call it an inevitable conclusion based on unimpeachable reasoning
double green revision a
the question my friend the genius is what are you going to do about it
cherry revision a
im thinking about what im going to do about it
i got him
you didnt get me
you think you got me
how about this
who would make a move like that
a genius maybe
tuvia has been listening nearby
aron races into the camp
we see aron whispering in tuvias ear
double salmon revision
calls out asael
asael comes running
get a message to zus
hes got to tell viktor theyre coming
tuvia stands peering out into the forest
asael joins him
lazar spotted another patrol
theyre getting closer
suddenly he hears a strange sound
do you hear that
we hear the sound for what it is
the cry of a newborn
a baby boy in this mud manger
riva and lilka have assisted
tamara holds her new baby to her breast
suddenly the blanket serving as a door is swept aside
tuvia stands there
tamara cries out and shields the baby
lilka springs up and pushes him back outside
tuvia walks angrily
lilka keeps up
she promises not to take extra food
this is against my orders
so you are going to shoot her too
tuvia stares at her
he has never seen this side of her
the baby is all she has to live for
i cannot allow it
he turns away
double salmon revision a
lilka spins him around surprising him with her strength and the strength of her passion
you must let it live
i cannot keep the living alive
tamara and the man who fathered this child are responsible for its fate
she was raped by the nazis
tuvia closes his eyes
he is tired of being in charge tired of being the arbiter of other peoples fate
you tell us to hold onto our humanity
not to become like animals
what better way than by bringing a life into this world of suffering and death
its our only hope
tuvia is undone by her intensity
the very nearness of her
the smell of her newly washed hair
the glow of her skin
he looks at her
and nods in surrender
thank you tuvia
she kisses him
a chaste kiss of gratitude
she pulls back and they look into each others eyes
the next kiss is something entirely different
i knew what was expected of the women here yet you never touched me
im not afraid of anything tuvia
im not even afraid of you
they kiss deeply
lilka lies in his arms
double goldenrod revision
the germans are coming into the forest
i dont know what is going to become of us
it doesnt matter
if i had stayed in the ghetto id be dead
you saved my life
you have saved mine
he reaches for her but before they can begin to make love again the blanket door is pushed aside
malbin is there
weve caught one
is led into the clearing
he wears the same uniform as those who marched the villagers into the forest for execution
hes a scout
theyre coming for us
group members have begun to gather around him
they begin to hurl insults schtik drek paskudnyak as the hapless man is pushed to his knees
we found this in his pouch
he hands tuvia a sheaf of documents including a map
entrance points wetlands obstacles
hands it to shimon you read this
re the documents theyve assigned an entire division to surround the forest
a tidal wave is coming
dont they have a war to fight
still reading assault begins in two days
meanwhile some of the group have begun tormenting the man
he kicks him in the head
shulman punches him in the face
to asael did you reach viktor
hes on his way
the tormenting of the poor courier is gaining intensity
the german lets loose a torrent of pleading
ich habe frau und kinder
he says he has a wife and children
lazar picks up a stick
the german tries to crawl away the crowd blocks his escape pushing him back into the center
cherry revision a
so did i
if you let him go he will lead them back here
tuvia looks at malbin
what to do
ask if hell promise not to reveal our location
sie mussen versprechen nicht zu sagan wo wir sind
the man looks up at him pleadingly
hell say anything
he breaks the stick across the mans back
we want justice
soon it is a chant justice
tuvia looks at their faces
only months ago they were decorous civilized
now they are hungry almost feral
bella has been silently watching
she steps into the circle looks down at the terrified german man
my sons name was david
we see now that she is holding a sharpened hoe
he was fifteen
he had blue eyes
she raises it above her head
he played the piano
she swings with all her might
the others watch with a mix of thrilled horror and perverse delight
a line has been crossed
riva steps forward holding a large shovel
my sisters name was ellie
as she swings the shovel the camera begins to back away
miriam steps forward carrying a large rock
my husband was meyer
the group closes in obscuring our view of the body
aron cant take any more
he runs off into the woods
cherry revision a
my parents sol and raya
cherry revision a
for my daughter sonya
for my mother
my whole family
tuvia closes his eyes
he has done nothing to stop it
asael looks at malbin and shimon
they are undone by what they have witnessed
tuvia walks away
behind them the group separates staring at the lifeless body on the ground
and then they look at each other their blood lust sated beginning to reckon with what they have done
what they have become
he sees aron squatting beside a tree crying silently
tuvia kneels beside him cradling him
reeboynoy shel oylum
lord of the universe
we have done unspeakable things yet still i seek your mercy
he hears something
malbin waits at the edge of the forest
his face is drawn and pale from what has just happened
double green revision
viktor is here
are waiting in the clearing
he and zus nod to each other but do not speak
it is excruciating
tuvia and viktor walk into the woods
zus waits with other bodyguards as asael joins them
zus wears a nazi jacket
he doesnt look good
i could say the same about you
whered you get the jacket
lets just say the former owner no longer had need of it
the other bodyguards stare impassively
asael looks confused for a moment then embraces him
shoves a revolver into his pocket wolnicky stores ammunition for us in his barn
theres no guard
he slaps asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades
sit on a downed tree and converse in russian with subtitles you found these on the prisoner
viktor studies the scouts documents
we cant fight an entire division
the battle on the eastern front has begun
the more troops we engage here the fewer they have to attack the motherland
double green revision a
weve done our part for the motherland
my orders are to take command of all partisan operations
you will bring the rest of your fighters to me
and the others
old people women and children
in war there are casualties
and if i refuse
you are officially a deserter
do you know the policy on dealing with deserters
viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket
the germans are offering fifty thousand marks for information leading to your capture
hands it to him not a very flattering likeness
viktor rejoins his bodyguards turns back for a last word
have your men in my camp by tonight
he walks off
asael takes the wanted poster from tuvia
i wouldnt show this around
there are some whod turn you in for less
down below viktor and the russian partisans have struck their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees
viktors gaze follows the plane
he gives an order into a field radio
zus has been listening
you want them to find tuvias camp
viktor just looks at him
youre deliberately sacrificing them so we can remain safe
so we can keep fighting
everyone must sacrifice in the struggle
those are my brothers
i am your brother
he is your brother
your jewish sentimentality is heart warming but counter revolutionary
zus has secretly known he would hear these words
he grips his rifle but holds his tongue
tuvia stares up at it
have they been spotted
shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children
he looks pale
his cough is worse
he is very ill
but the children of israel were afraid to leave egypt
until moses said do not trust in me trust in god
he will take care of you a wrenching cough and so tomorrow we celebrate the passover by sitting around and arguing just as we have done for centuries
tuvia stares at them a curious expression on his face
malbin comes to stand beside him
looking at the plane did it see us
tomorrow is passover
how should i know
malbin doesnt get it at first
he left before pharaoh could stop them
now malbin understands
he looks at shimon
you want to move them all
the old the sick
theyll never make it
it isnt the first time tuvia has consigned people to their death and apparently it wont be the last
we leave now
spread the word
is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation
sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs
asael and malbin coax the older people into motion come tateh but my tools the sound of approaching aircraft
tuvia searches the sky
riva pairs each of the elderly with a child
tamara tucks her newborn under her coat
the sound of the approaching aircraft grows louder
people look up shielding their eyes
then from out of the sun two ominous silhouettes panics the crowd
some race into the forest others are frozen
tuvia grabs people and bodily drags them to cover
strafing mm cannon chew up the ground
several people are hit before they can reach cover
lilka herds everyone she can into where people crowd in like sardines
chaya and riva gather children around them
they hear the whistle of an incoming shell
dirt from the roof rains down on them
dirt and debris everywhere
an incendiary shell hits high in a tree
its branches burst into flame
an hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is blown apart
zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping on his brothers
it explodes into a million pieces
wood shrapnel everywhere
where once was a bunker now there is only a gaping crater
tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded
he tries to clear his head but he cannot focus
all sound fades away to be replaced by a high pitched hum
falling dirt and debris tumbling bodies exploding bunkers a surreal effect
cowering in safety malbin sees tuvia lying in the open and gathers his courage racing through danger to his side
are you alright
tuvia shakes his head points to his ears
he cannot hear
when tuvia speaks his words sound dull and muffled
malbin looks around panicked
asael appears out of the smoke yells at malbin above the din
get them out of the bunkers
malbin runs off
asael helps tuvia to his feet
a nearby explosion showers them with dirt as they crawl to safety
the world ramps back to normal speed at a dizzying rate
we need to hold them off
until the rest are safe
tuvia still cant hear
asael pantomimes firing a rifle
tuvia nods trying to clear the buzzing in his head
with levine and miriam
points out positions lazar rosa and schmuel
there and there
tuvia nods and me
tuvia shakes his head no
he runs off
still clearing his head tuvia regains his footing suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped
goldenrod revision a
malbin appears eyes wild
but the groups natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety goldenrod revision
this gets the job done
people begin to crawl out
young people holding hands with old parents with children on their backs
tuvia urges lilka and bella to hurry them into the woods
take up their assigned positions levine mans the heavy machine gun behind a log lazar miriam and rosa in the trees
tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children to disappear into the forest
tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack
he knows the ground troops will soon follow
he turns to asael grabbing his shoulders
dont try to fight
just slow them down
then join us
no need for more words
they embrace fiercely
asael pushes chaya toward tuvia
she resists clinging to his arm for a moment
he forces her to join him and catch up to the others
is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle
the defenders check their weapons with grim efficiency
they are no longer inept innocents they have become warriors
tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on
we study their faces
beautiful in their stoic acceptance
goldenrod revision a
suddenly a fusillade from the woods
rosa falls dead
the defenders return fire
levine fires the machine gun miriam feeds the belt
tuvia hears small arms fire
he knows what it means
the rear guard action cant hold out for very long
tree by tree they begin to fall back
asael fires blindly into the murky shadows
the sound of a man crying out
then levine is hit
miriam pushes him out of the way and takes over
she expertly kills several assault troops who appear out of the woods
the rest of the attackers take cover
malbin waits anxiously for tuvia clutching a map
struggling to control his panic this swamp here
lazar runs from tree to tree keeping up a steady stream of fire
he is surprisingly brave
until a grenade flies out of the woods and lands at his feet killing him instantly
the assault troops have begun to outflank them
asael is suddenly in jeopardy
sara sees the danger
miriam keeps their attackers pinned down as the two men race for new positions
then she is hit
she keeps firing anyway her finger locked on the trigger even as she is dying
more troops begin firing from their flank
asael has no choice but to break off
they race into the woods
tuvia hears the guns go silent
this too has meaning
malbin stares at what lies ahead
oh my god
tan revision a
are the others back yet
malbin looks stricken he shakes his head asael
malbin shakes his head once more
asael is not coming back
chaya begins to weep
riva comforts her
weve got to keep going
the germans will be here any minute
to tuvia do we wait
we could hide
i say fight them here
tuvia is in hell
if he waits for asael he risks them all being caught
suddenly it all falls apart
tuvia sinks to his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight
tuvia cant speak
he has no more answers
nothing to say
he stares at the impenetrable swamp
the end of the line
the sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all
they stare at one another anxious and rudderless
my father cannot make it
there are snakes tamaras newborn is crying
she tries to comfort it
an old woman stares at the swamp in terror
well put them on our shoulders
tan revision a
tuvia what do we do
oppenheim is petrified
rona is crying
and still tuvia is silent
a general murmur of dread is rising
malbin goes to kneel beside shimon who is covered in sweat undone by the forced march
whats wrong with him
fighting for breath he
malbin hears something looks up
they have been found
lilka kneels beside tuvia
tan revision b
she takes his hand silently
he shakes his head
you have a weapon
she shows him her revolver
he checks the clip then looks into her eyes
use it on yourself before you let them take you
she nods gravely
suddenly a voice interrupts
why are we stopping
back from the dead
he hands off a wounded comrade to rivas care
to tuvia why arent we moving
tuvia looks up at him lost
we must keep going
it is impossible
asael raises his voice
nothing is impossible
what we have done is impossible
the murmuring quiets
asael meets tuvias eyes
he is literally willing his older brother to be strong for them as he has been time and again
god will not part these waters
we will do it ourselves
goldenrod revision b
not by miracles
by our strength
cherry revision c
turning to the man beside him take the rope from your pack
confused he obeys now you
give me your belt
we dont have enough rope
well link arms
make a chain
a human chain
what are you talking about
tuvia is deeply moved
his little brother has become a man
once more he finds his voice
each person takes care of the other
meeting asaels eye give him your belt
asael nods at tuvia gratefully
the group is hushed apprehensive
then removes his belt and offers it to asael
and then another
one by one they offer them
there is something quietly heroic in the gesture
tuvia looks at the group looks away fighting back emotion
salmon revision d e
people link arms and hold on for dear life yet still they flounder
a man goes under is pulled up
a harrowing undertaking
people cling to it as they drag themselves hand over hand
double cherry revision
no tracks on land
get back in
it is almost impossible to make any progress
especially when one is weak and malnourished
the mud sticks to their clothes faces
soon they are indistinguishable from their surroundings
when one person sinks in the muck it takes three to get him back on his feet
the column slows
tuvia gestures for them to keep moving
he begins to physically push them on
eventually they are moving again
gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist
they trudge forward their expressions wan and empty
tuvia find malbin and pulls him aside
how much farther
malbin shrugs his shoulders
parents hoist children onto their shoulders hold weapons overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves forward step by tortuous step
shimon clings to a tree
his wracking cough is terrifying and he is deathly pale
shimon cant catch his breath he just shakes his head no
he cant go on
tuvia half drags half carries him onward
they rest eat what little food is left
a litter carrying shimon is deposited on dry ground
he is barely alive
tuvia shakes his head
its only a matter of time
the spotter plane drones overhead
take off your glasses
tuvia moves off to check on the others
shimon listen to me the physical plane is just an illusion
only the spiritual plane is real
fighting for breath no
the physical plane is where man acts to redeem himself
youve redeemed yourself enough you should shut up now
look whos talking about shutting up
i need to tell you something
leans closer what is it
you shouldnt think so much
the world around you is beautiful
stunned looks around this world
even this one
tuvia has come to sit beside lilka
she leans into him
she puts her arms around him
cherry revision a
they hold each other and drift off to sleep
sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp
the lights of their fire can be seen flickering through the reeds as the ragged column moves silently past
not a sound
pass the word
we watch as the order is passed down the line
parents hold hands over their childrens mouths
shimon is carried on an improvised litter made of branches
panchenko and a few others are on horseback
behind them the rest of the partisans are marching away
zus and the jewish fighters are on foot awaiting orders
double cherry revision
you will hold this crossroads until the brigade has completed its retreat
zus looks around at the position
for how long
panchenkos orders are never to be questioned
until you are ordered to withdraw
and if we cannot hold the position
panchenko looks at gramov who stands nearby cradling a submachine gun
comrade gramov will enforce discipline if necessary
the implications are clear nobody retreats
you have served us well comrade
a wintry smile i am so honored comrade
panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off
zus and his men take cover in the woods
in the distance we can hear the unmistakable sound of approaching armor
lova kneels beside zus
what are we doing here
half a mile down the road a tank rumbles into view
who are we doing this for
with a shaking hand zus tries to light a molotov cocktail but his matches are wet
he reaches into his pocket for more
instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to his familys door
as he stares at it the sound of the approaching tank grows louder
yellow revision a
empties at last into a shallow river
on the opposite bank is dry land and beyond the deep forest
the bedraggled group makes their way across
green revision a
asael pulls people up onto dry ground
they lie there freezing and exhausted
some cannot control their shivering
tuvia cant help but laugh
soon they are all laughing
it ripples throughout the group
an overwhelming feeling of relief
they are safe
tuvia lies on the ground
all the adrenaline has suddenly left his body
then aron appears tugging at his sleeve
shimon is asking for him
tuvia kneels down beside his teacher whose eyes are closed
malbin is weeping quietly
who will he argue with
a whisper tuvia
shimon is at the end
finding the strength i almost lost
to save us
and i thank you
he closes his eyes
its too much for tuvia
hard as he tries he cannot stop the tears from filling his eyes
trees begin to fall over as if pushed by a dinosaur
emerges onto the banks less than a quarter of mile away
the menacing gun turning in their direction
the tank roars fire
the first round explodes among them
several are killed
back to the river
he pushes people down
they cling to the banks cowering
those with weapons take cover using the embankment as if it were the lip of a trench
they return fire old men young women even some children
behind the tank using it as protection
aron kills one
but the germans are well trained
they direct a withering fire forcing the partisans to keep their heads below the embankment
it turns its attentions on the riverbank its first round sails overhead sending up a huge geyser of water
but the next round plows into the earth tearing a huge chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade
tuvia grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades
he throws the satchel over malbins head grabs his arm and races crouching low beneath the lip of the riverbank
asael provides covering fire
so do lilka chaya and the women alongside the men
a stand of trees hides tuvia from view as he climbs out of the river and heads into the forest
he pulls malbin down just as a squad of german infantry approaches and begins to set up a heavy machine gun
green revision a
tuvia pops up behind them spraying them with his submachine gun
he then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry advancing behind the tank to devastating effect
but now the tank turns its attention to tuvia
its machine gun begins to chew up the forest forcing tuvia to take cover
without pausing to think malbin grabs a grenade from the satchel and races toward the tank
it falls pitifully short exploding harmlessly as malbin is cut down
double blue revision
bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover
it is only a matter of moments before he is dead
zus and the rest of jewish fighters emerge firing on the run
without regard for his own life zus charges
the german infantry is caught in a cross fire as the bielski brigade climbs out the river firing wildly
zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun from the open hatch
jumps onto the tank and drops a grenade inside
an explosion of black smoke billows
zus stands up amid the billowing smoke
he sees tuvia who is staring back at him
asael is the first to reach tuvia who is carrying the german assault machine gun
only weapons and ammunition
spread the word
tuvia hands him the machine gun
tuvia looks at him
is he fucking with him
just a little
lilka is carrying a small child
lilka please help
weve got to get the injured into the forest
what about the dead
everybody gather your things
we have to get out of the open
nearby aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it to zus
zus embraces her
tuvia seizes one of the german rifles
he yells to shulman
double blue revision a
shulman follows tuvias order
throwing the weapon youve been promoted
tuvia turns sees bella with zus
they see him
zus hands bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches
where is the rest of your unit
you are going back
they look at each other
so much unsaid
no time to say it
weve got to build a new camp
perhaps you have room for one more
double blue revision
tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely
they walk in silence
lilka comes to walk beside him resting her head on his shoulder as they walk
tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the towering trees as if allowing himself to appreciate its beauty for the first time
suddenly he stops listening puzzled
dont you hear it
isnt it beautiful
we hold on tuvia
he has aged ten years in one
but for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction
we might even see the ghost of a smile
but it is short lived as asael appears by his side and we see concern once again clouding his face
another problem to attend to
and as the camera begins to pull away he is already hurrying to catch up with the others
as they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness of the woods these words appear on screen park avenue
more words on screen in the taxi the elderly man thrusts his hand through the slot in the plexiglas window separating him from the driver
here is money
i can get more
so much more
take it please
indeed when the cabbie speaks though the voice is older and somewhat frail we recognize it as tuvias
what else can i give you do for you
nothing it isnt necessary
tears stream down the elderly mans cheeks
we are alive because of you
looks at his son my children
double cherry revision
behind them horns are honking
this is new york city
please the traffic
bless you tuvia bielski
may the lord bless you and keep you all the days of your life
papa who was that man
the elderly man watches the cab pull away wiping his eyes
that wasnt a man
that was an angel
as the cab pulls away the camera cranes up until it is lost in an anonymous sea of traffic
these words appear on www
