href b b lord of illusions by clive barker as the credits run we intercut the following two sequences a slow drift through a collection of crudely constructed surreal six
foot tall idols
like modern demons
we lap dissolve between details of their twisted anatomies headlamp eyes bright metal claws broken glass teeth
two vehicles one a volkswagen bus decorated with stylized flames the other a thunderbird speeding along a series of eerily empty desert roads somewhere in a wilderness of sand and
a violent wind howls around but through the sand we can just make out a large ominous building the house of william nix
its walls are white washed and scrawled with graffiti
the family of idols surrounds the doorway guarding it
on screen the words nevada thirteen years ago were at the front door now which stands open
leaning against the door frame is a scrawny wild eyed youth about sixteen
his name is butterfield
hes got a brooding almost sultry look on his face
one of his eyes is black the other milky blue
hes whittling something with a scalpel
distantly the sound of car engines
butterfield narrows his eyes
the volkswagen bus and thunderbird are approaching the house
he turns from the door
in his haste he drops the wood hes whittling
hes been carving a deaths head
the house no longer serves any domestic function
it has become the temple and dormitory of nixs small apocalyptic cult
as we go through the house with butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like
the rooms are murky and chaotic
the walls painted with scenes of cities and landscapes burning and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare attacking raping and devouring helpless humanity
the atmosphere is joyless and oppressive
the passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house
only oil lamps set on the floor light these claustrophobic corridors
a dozen cultists sit cross legged on the floor in front of their leader william nix
his black hair grows to his shoulders
his eyes are deep and glittering his voice seductive
a terrifying yet charismatic presence
all the cultists who are a cross section of obsessives wear the same simple t shirts painted with the cults sigil
they watch nix in adoration
as nix speaks he juggles a flame passing it from hand to hand with casual ease
and the fire said to me nix nix youre my instrument
from now on youll be called the puritan
nix you will find a few good men and women and together together you will cleanse the world
nix looks up
nix rises smiling
to cultists well come back to this
get about your business
as the cultists disperse nix and butterfield exit into a place of nightmares
hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque sculpture three times the bulk of a large man and made of metal fly blown animal parts and knotted rope
it is vaguely cruciform but its swaying creaking bulk is not even faintly christian
it is a perverse sickening image evoking insanity and agony
from the shadows in the corner we hear a young girls soft hush
nix goes to the girl
she is twelve beautiful blonde and presently in a state of mortal fear
she sits bound in a fetal position her face soaked with sweat and tears her mouth bloodied her cheek bruised
i said hush
let me go
from the opposite corner the screech of nixs pet baboon
nix goes to it
the animal is large and lethal
to baboon what is it
the baboon pulls on its chain staring at the girl and baring its teeth as it screeches
to girl i think hes in love
he unshackles the baboon
the animal pads toward the girl trailing its chain
keep it away from me
nix catches hold of its chain
holds it back
the baboon starts screeching again scrabbling at the girl its nails catching her arms and legs drawing blood
nix watches her terror dispassionately
also watching wide eyed want me to shoot swann
you dont like him do you
he wants your magic
go fetch him
nix advances on the girl
what are you going to do
the two vehicles come to a halt outside nixs house
from the thunderbird steps philip swann a nineteen year old with shoulder length hair and brilliant blue eyes
hes not conventionally handsome but hes certainly striking
from the passenger seat steps caspar quaid a black man studious and intense
from the bus emerges murray pimm skinny and jittery and jennifer desiderio a woman with a steely gaze
to all three are we ready
cool say the word
very nervous look maybe we should think this over
on swann as he brings from his car three very bizarre pieces of metalwork
we get only a tantalizing glimpse of them as he slips them into his pocket
hes gone too far
so he took a child
hell kill her
no he wont
determined hes not going to get the chance
quaid checks a gun then slips it into his belt
if he gets in our fucking heads hell drive us crazy
so stay out here
swann starts towards the house
jennifer is the first to follow with the other two on her heels
butterfield comes to the door as swann steps inside
hes expecting you
behind swann quaid and pimm exchange nervous looks
to others look around
if you find the child yell
shes got blonde hair thats all i know
butterfield turns away smiling to himself
swann follows him
quaid looks into a large circular room where five cultists three men and two women still sit
one of the women is breast feeding a baby
i thought you said you werent coming back
i changed my mind
come and join us
she smiles a crazy smile
reaches out for quaid
a snake appears from around the back of her neck
and now we see that there are snakes everywhere
in the cultists clothes and hair
even on the baby
quaid turns away
theres a snake on the door frame winding around his hand
he strikes it to the ground and drives his heel down on its head
angry dont do that
the snake handler gets up
quaid retreats from the door
snake handler picks up the dead snake and lifting it above his head dribbles its blood onto his face
jennifer enters a gloomy room
she goes to a mattress where a blonde girl lies with her bare back to us
dont be afraid
the blonde girl barbara turns over
she has a dirty cloth pressed to a wound between her breasts
it is not the girl of course
she stares up at jennifer clearly drugged
want to see
she pulls the cloth away
she has carved the cult sigil into her flesh
the bloody knife lies beside her
jennifer retreats to the door and exits back out into pimm is standing against the wall clutching a crucifix
he is ashen with terror
jennifer snatches the crucifix from his white knuckled fingers
hes going to kill us all
where did swann go
pimm points down the passageway towards nixs room
swann wipes sweat from his upper lip then reaches down to his belt to check the gun tucked out of sight at his side
he turns the door handle
swann steps inside
nixs chair has its back to him
the folds of nixs robe are visible however
swann hears a muffled sobbing from the far side of the room
on the girl now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth
swann starts towards her his footsteps barely audible
as he approaches the chair the baboon leaps at him screeching
he reaches for his gun
the chair topples
the baboon half dressed in nixs robes bounds towards swann
swann fires at it
the bullet blasts off half its head
on quaid who draws his gun as three cultists appear in the passageway that leads to nixs sanctum
stay the fuck away
get over here
pan up from the twitching baboon corpse to swann as he struggles with the girls gag
he has laid his gun on the ground beside her
youre going to be okay
out of focus behind him the cruciform sculpture swings round
nix is hanging on it like an idol on a grotesque altarpiece
the girl sees nix over swanns shoulder
terror crosses her face
i knew youd come
he reaches down to swann
ive got so much power to give you swann
all you have to do is
you dont think ive got it to give
nix swoops down on swann
apparently defying gravity
he catches hold of swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall
i could eat your fucking soul swann
jennifer reaches the door of the sanctum
butterfield steps from the shadows
his knife flashes as it strikes jennifers hand
she retreats staunching her bleeding hand
nix has swann trapped against the wall and is working his fingers against swanns temples
working working like a psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient
you want to know what the world really looks like
swann struggles but he cant get free of nixs hold
and now horribly nixs fingers slide beneath the skin of swanns temples without a drop of blood being spilt
want to see flesh with a gods eyes
swann screams as nixs mind hold seizes him
quaid levels his gun at butterfield who is guarding the sanctum door
jennifer is at quaids side
get away from the door
butterfield shakes his head
strikes the wall beside butterfields head
he retreats growling like a rabid animal
quaid kicks the sanctum door open and enters
to quaid here he is
swann stumbles into the middle of the room the whites of his eyes blood red
take a look swann
these are your friends
on swann reeling like a drunkard as he looks up at quaid and jennifer
what have you done to him
of quaid and jennifer
to swanns eyes their faces seem to be morphing
their humanity is melting away
whats left is like a jellyfish with black soulless eyes primeval muck
quaid reaches for swann who retreats in horror shaking his head violently
dont touch me
got into my head
you want to be like that swann
mud and shit
swann turns away from quaid and jennifer in disgust
of nix his arms outstretched in welcome
his face has an aura of pulsing light
share the power
on a gun leveled
we dont see by whom
the trigger is pulled
the bullet strikes nixs back and explodes out of his chest
on swann staring at nix
of nix as the aura of light dies
just for a moment a terrible moment swann glimpses something else
morphing out of nixs features
a nightmare face with waves of darkness emanating from the middle of its forehead
swann covers his eyes
raging terrifying swann
nix staggers letting out an ungodly howl and drops to his knees clutching the wound
as he falls he reveals the ashen girl who is still holding swanns smoking gun
a roar help me
swann shakes his head ridding himself of nixs mind control
jesus pinon stands guard his gun pointed on several cultists
with distressing confidence you cant kill him
hell just rise up again
on nix doing just that rising up
right hand clamped to his bloody chest left hand reaching for swann
quaid fires at him again
strikes his shoulder
strikes his leg
nix collapses to the ground quickly
they have come prepared for this
swann now takes from his jacket the three strange pieces of metalwork
there are screws in then all
what are you doing
he clamps one of the pieces over nixs eyes
it fits like an eyeless mask
nix thrashes and screams
swann lays his hands on the side of the mask and like magic his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord grinding into nixs flesh and bone with
a gut wrenching sound
blood runs from the screw holes
fuck you swann
now the second piece over his mouth
sw hes silenced
the piece screws itself into his head like the first
and now comes the third and final piece over the nose and into the ears
again it screws itself into place
swann has done all he can
he retreats from nixs body as it continues to convulse
we go from face to ashen face as each man and woman watches and waits
why wont he die
and now at last the violence of nixs death throes diminishes
nixs body bends like a bow arching off the ground and with one last terrible spasm he dies
quietly is it finished
the cultists faces slacken as though some mental hold nix had upon them has disappeared
then they start to retreat their confidence and courage gone
pimm steps into the sanctum
the five assassins including the girl stand around nixs body
swann has his arm around the girl
we bury him so deep no one will ever find him
the wind has died away
its eerily calm
butterfield dashes towards camera then halts
he looks back as nixs killers load his huge limp corpse into the back of murray pimms bus
he watches with a feral look on his face
the city looks magical in the spring light its palms and gleaming towers its rivers of sun baked traffic evoking some fantastical metropolis
this for all its smog and congestion is a city of exoticism and enchantments
on screen the words los angeles thirteen years later the facade of this small hotel off hollywood boulevard needs a lick of paint and the neon sign is blinking fitfully
but it has a certain charm
a large deteriorating mural of hollywoodland depicting a host of s movie stars dominates the lobby
at the front desk with his back to us at present stands harry damour
he is having difficulty getting the pretty but vacant blonde at the reception desk to comprehend his name
howd you spell that again
isnt that french for something
on the bellboy approaching harry from the front door
to blonde yeah
for love right
to blonde right
grinning thats so cool
hes wearing a washed out grateful dead t shirt an italian cut linen suit and glasses
hes handsome unshaven ish with an open easy smile
you havent paid the cab
he wont give us your bags til you pay him
thirty five bucks
tell him he can keep them
the bellboy looks puzzled
harry gets out his wallet and hands over four ten dollar bills
ive got my life in there
on the suit case which is now on the bed
harry flings it open
inside mingled with the clothes a bizarre collection of items which he tosses out onto the coverlet
a statue of shiva the hindu lord of creation and destruction
on harry as he heads into the bathroom
turns on the shower
starts to undress
harry his hair still wet from his shower steps out into the sun
puts on sunglasses
have a nice evening mr
harry stands in a shabby doorway across the street from a classy restaurant
on tapert a middle aged balding man with a very pretty woman opposite him sitting at a table close to the window
tapert makes a joke unheard
the woman laughs
on harry chewing on a hamburger as he speaks into his tape recorder
nine eighteen p
taperts either got a great sense of humour or hes paying her to laugh
looks at hamburger in disgust jesus
on tapert as he rises from the table
into tape recorder hes finished
tapert exits the restaurant and crosses the street
harry tosses his half eaten hamburger away and goes to his car
harry pulls the parking ticket off the windshield screws it up and gets in
into tape nine twenty six p
hes off again
he turns the key in the ignition
in neon blue and purple a sign blazes in a store window
it reads tarot card and crystal readings special on tapert as he hurries across the street and through the door beside the store window
we pan off the door as harrys car comes to a halt on the far side of the street
harry gets out of the car
stares at the sign in the window puzzled
he starts across the street
suddenly oh my god
tapert emerges his face white with terror
he stumbles to his car and hes away
harry freezes caught between the need to follow tapert and sheer curiosity
he gives in to the latter and steps inside
an illuminated arrow points up the stairs
harry ascends past faded photographs of caspar quaid with famous faces
at the landing the passageway turns ninety degrees
harry halts and takes out his gun
theres a strange rumbling sound approaching from round the corner
harry chances a look
theres a short length of passageway leading to an open door
from the threshold a crystal ball rolls towards harry blood smeared
this is the source of the rumbling
harry stops the ball before it falls down the stairs
after a beat harry creeps towards the open door
he pushes it open
the fake antique furniture is splintered the astral charts slashed
there are two offices
in the front a waiting room into which harry now steps
beyond it through a door that stands narrowly ajar the fortune telling room
from out of the fortune telling room a moan
harry crosses the waiting room reaching into his jacket for his gun
suddenly a nightmarish figure leaps from the shadows
his name is ray miller
hes as crazy as a rabid dog teeth sharpened eyes wild
nixs sigil is tattooed on the middle of his forehead
he strikes the gun from harrys hand and goes for his throat
harry reaches out behind him picks up a phrenologists bust and smashes it on millers skull
miller reels back
harry makes a dash for the door to the fortune telling room
a mysterious candle lit space
in the middle of the room a table
at it sits quaid
thirteen years older
he has been tortured close to death
several small scalpels protrude from his chest and neck
his life is ebbing away
on the table in front of him a fan of tarot cards blood spattered
harry races in through the open door from the waiting room
what the fuck
harry picks up the phone
miller charges at the door
harry slams the door in millers face and locks it
as he does so the candles flicker
harry looks up
a figure looms from the darkness behind quaid
hes in his late twenties an androgynous disturbing sight
his long hair is drawn back into a pony tail
his mismatched eyes one black one milky blue tell us that he is butterfield
his hands are bloody and he carries one last scalpel
to butterfield dont touch him
butterfield strokes the wounds on quaids cheek
quaid sobs in pain
what are you going to do about it
millers hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side
his fingers appear scrabbling to tear the lock out
harry doesnt move or miller will be through
to harry ever watched a man die
if you watch very closely you can sometimes see the soul escaping
and if youre very quick you can catch it
i wasnt there
jennifer desiderios disappeared
they knew the puritan was coming home
as this exchange goes on miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to throw himself against it from the other side
its all harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room
he looks around for some means of defense
theres a crack in the drapes to the left of the table
behind it a window
so do you
youve seen the future
and are you afraid
suddenly harry steps aside
the doors flung open
miller charges in
harry catches hold of his arm and throws him against the drape
the window cracks the drape comes down around miller
amber streetlight floods in
butterfield is momentarily distracted
harry strikes the scalpel from his hands
miller meanwhile is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes
harry lands a solid kick to the mans belly
miller is thrown back against the cracked window which shatters
still wrapped in the drape he falls out
harry turns back to arrest butterfield but hes already making his escape
harry starts after him
to harry dont leave me
he turns back
tears are pouring down the mans face
harry goes back to comfort quaid as butterfield escapes down the stairs
you need an ambulance
in pain too late
why are you here
did you cone
up here for a reading
quaid takes hold of harrys hand
quaid stares at harrys hand
fascinated he momentarily forgets his pain
he traces the lines with bloody fingers
quietly my god
youve taken some strange journeys in your life
you could say that
youre drawn to the dark side over and over
and its drawn to you
looks at harry you dont like that
you cant change it
you have to walk
coughs walk the line between heaven and hell
its your destiny
harry takes his hand from quaids grip
quaid winces in pain
im not afraid to die
theres something terrible
who is he
quaid shudders and dies
softly sadly shit
he looks away down at the cards
all have been turned over but one
he turns it
the card is the ten of swords which pictures a prostrate man against a thunderous sky pierced by all ten swords
an image of death and desolation
the flashing lights of two patrol cars illuminate the scene
detective eddison a surfer turned policeman with buzz cut blond hair heads along the alley with harry
hes midway through taking harrys statement
there are already two officers examining the drapes
we cant yet see the body
to harry what were you doing up there
im a private detective
i was hired to follow somebody for a few days
a guy called tapert
so now ive got tapert butterfield
taperts got nothing to do with this
he came here to get his palm read
what makes you so sure
shrugs i got a file on him two inches thick
hes a petty fraudster
this is something else
ever heard of someone called the puritan
new one on me
to officer okay
lets see him
officer l shakes his head and opens up the drape
broken glass drops from the folds but thats all
miller has gone
where the fuck is he
he got up and walked
looking up at window after that fall
he must have broken half his bones
we move in on harry as he stares down at the drape
i dont think hed have given a shit
the rooms are spartan
nothing on the walls
nothing on the floors
very little furniture
butterfield sits beside the window obsessively combing his long hair
there is something feminine about him now his voice a whisper his stare distracted
if we didnt guess it already were in the presence of a madman
miller is squatting against the wall picking shards of glass out of his torso
it hurts but hes enjoying himself
why do i know that name
i know him
i saw him
he stops to pull out a particularly large piece of glass sighing with pleasure
i saw him on t
some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastards life
hes a priest
hes just a guy whos got a nose for this shit
a smirk like you
a long beat of silence
miller digs for glass
i dont want him getting in the way
dreamily weve all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled
what do you mean all of us
you didnt think it was just going to be you and me
a lot of people believed in nix
they havent forgotten his promise
what about death
a beat its an illusion
on screen philadelphia a suburban street
early morning light
close up of a photograph of the cultist with the painted face from the opening scene standing outside nixs house in nevada
his name is norman sanders
on norman thirteen years older looking down at the photograph
he lays it down beside a letter on which two words are written homecoming time
norman smiles to himself
goes to the wardrobe
gets out a small suitcase
his wifes body is slumped in the wardrobe glassy eyed
close up of letter and draw out from the letter to a different interior a different domestic circumstance
on the screen miami
barbara the blonde girl who carved the cults sigil into her chest is washing her hands
she casually dries them and picks up the letter walking past her husband and son both dead at the breakfast table blood spreading around their heads
when she gets to the door she steps over the body of her daughter who has also been shot trying to escape her mothers murder spree
on the radio george harrison sings my sweet lord
i really want to see you lord and it wont take long my lord my sweet lord
on screen san antonio
a zoo keeper wanders into the darkened interior of the reptile house
the zoo keepers benign expression changes at the sight of the chaos inside
the glass cases have been smashed
another keeper lies on the ground his face pulped
a few snakes slither around his body but most of them have gone
the snake handler cultist drives at speed
pan up from another letter with the same message on the dashboard to the crazed face of the snake handler
pan to the back of the car
it seethes with hundreds of snakes
its early morning in bel air
the sun shines down on a millionaires paradise a huge house surrounded by a jungle of trees and blossoms
the blue water glitters in the noon day sun
and a woman her body perfectly proportioned glides under the surface emerging at the shallow end where the housekeeper clemenzia is setting a tray on a table
swanns name is dorothea
she is a beautiful and sensual woman
she dries off
in his study
a beat he got something on his mind
bad mood today
venetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight but a lamp burns on the desk huge showing us the furniture leather the books innumerable and the figure of swann sitting
behind the desk smoking a cigar
hes lost some hair and some colour over the years but he still has the same hypnotic eyes
he studies the l
times in front of him
fortune teller brutally murdered the headline announces
underneath a photograph of quaids wrecked room
we close in on the photograph and catch a glimpse of harry standing looking at the chaos
moves down to the text beneath and on to the name harry damour
on swann pensive as he studies the paper
he looks up startled
dorothea the suns shining out there
dorothea is dressed in a white robe now
she literally brings light into this gloomy room
on the shelves behind swann are a number of art brut figurines vaguely recalling the idols outside nixs temple
bad show last night
wearily the usual
i tell them its magic
distastefully they believe you
a beat remember quaid
somebody killed him
disturbed i just saw him
a difficult silence
then swann crosses to the door
im putting in a new illusion tonight
will you be there
you want me to find out about quaid
i mean the funeral
superstitiously im not going near him
valentin is overseeing the hanging of a new piece in swanns collection a huge framed poster from a late nineteenth century magic spectacular
valentin is fifty or so his gray hair combed back close to his scalp
immaculately dressed in a distinctively european fashion
he orders the two picture hangers in a clipped fashion
the left hand sides too low
dorothea descends the stairs dressed for the day
to hangers good
to dorothea yes
gives him the newspaper you saw this
they walk back through the house together while the picture hanging goes on behind them
i want you to find this man damour for me
she passes the newspaper to valentin
he looks down at it
of harrys blurred picture
harry is sprawled on the bed in his under shorts
a shaft of sun darts between the drapes missing his face by inches
somebody is knocking on the door hard
he rolls over
the sun strikes his eyes
its one in the afternoon
what are you my mother
i need to speak to you mr
about last night
harry gets up and stumbles to the door
he opens it a little
the face of valentin is visible through the crack
whatever i said i didnt mean it okay
i get a few drinks inside me weve never met
then what do you want
im here to offer you a job
im going back to new york in consults his watch shit
im outta here
have you got a job thatll pay you five thousand a day
then harry takes the chain off the door
do i get lunch
a white sedan glides along the boulevard
at the wheel valentin
beside him harry
harry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee
whose is the car
youre driving it too carefully
sparring maybe i just bought it
somebodys been smoking in here for months
he pulls open the ashtray
pulls out a cigar butt
youre not the smoker
so who is
laughs you could almost pass for a detective damour
a beat i work for the best illusionist in the world
you know of him
i saw him in vegas once
are you a gambling man
when i can afford to lose
swanns quite a magician
never call him that
hes strictly an illusionist
whats the difference
illusions are trickery
magicians do it for real
the sedan turns into a driveway
the sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white marble tombs
harry and valentin walk towards a large mausoleum
any movie stars buried here
its not a bad place
i dont think the dead much care
are you sure
are you a believer then
valentin gives him an inquisitive look
ive signed on for them all in my time
you cant have too many saviours
harrys gaze is on the mausoleum now or rather on the woman in white standing in its cool shadows dorothea swann
she wears a wide brimmed hat
who is she
valentin sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book
he glances up
harry and dorothea are wandering between the graves deep in conversation
i want you to help me help my husband
i know hes in some kind of trouble
and its something to do with the man you saw murdered
did your husband know quaid
they werent close but they saw each other once in a while
i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards
i think we make our own futures
harry makes an approving murmur
whats the connection
covering now but well i dont exactly know
philip doesnt like to talk about the past
dorothea stops talking
takes off her sunglasses
her gaze is troubled but direct
there is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue
hes a secretive man
and you dont ask questions
we dont share our lives the way a lot of people do
does that mean
we havent slept in the same bed for years
but obviously you still care what happens to him
we wouldnt be having this conversation if i didnt
swanns one of the most remarkable men alive
you dont believe me
hes an illusionist
its not exactly brain surgery
dorothea stares at him
he could have been something more
maybe a lot more
but people get lost
even good people
too much fame
too much money where do i sign
dorothea laughs lightly
will you take the job mr
im no bodyguard
thats not what im asking for
i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards
and stop it from happening
when do you want me to start
come to the show with me
tonight i want you to see him with an audience
they love him
the question catches dorothea off guard
i didnt marry him for love mr
dorothea makes a little smile and walks away
harry watches her go exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure
harrys talking on the phone while he dresses for the theatre
youre not listening to me loomis
loomis a slob of a man is in his office eating pizza
the case is closed
taperts given us a full confession
get your ass back to mew york
im taking a couple of weeks vacation
you never took a fucking vacation in your life harry
whats going on
i got to go
call me tomorrow
theres other guys as good as me loomis
but not as cheap
a couple of weeks
who is she
harry cant help but smile to himself
i thought so
harry puts down the phone
glances at himself in the mirror
raises a rueful eyebrow
crane down from a looming standee of swann perched above the theatre marquee
spotlights rake the skies
the sidewalk below is jammed with audience members star spotters and photographers
this is a flashy prestigious event
limos are disgorging scantily dressed starlets and smiling money men a news team is interviewing audience members as they file in
the atmosphere is noisy and excited
amid the throng harry
he makes his way inside
the atmosphere is closer to a rock concert than a conventional stage show
security people with walkie talkies roam the aisles the audience buzzes with barely controlled hysteria
harry heads down the aisle eyes on the stage
a star lit curtain covers it
six rows from the stage is dorothea already in her seat
she smiles lavishly happy to see him
im glad you could make it
harry takes a seat beside her
hey this is a big deal for me
you know what seats like this cost in new york
center stage behind the closed curtains swann is ready for the opening of the show
technicians buzz around him like flies
valentin emerges from the wings patting the panther that is waiting there
the guy with dorothea
is that who i think it is
on swann his expression unreadable
music strikes up
a dramatic wagnerian chord
valentin hurries away
swanns expression becomes very focused
to swann ready
swann rises up into the flies
how the fuck does he do that
its wires man
i never seen no wires
sarcastic so what is it
the lights are dimming
harry glances across at dorothea whose gaze is intent
the lights go out
the music swells and the curtains fly apart
a spectacle worthy of seigfried and roy is about to blast our senses
magic for the s a wild erotic ride into mystery
ladies and gentlemen
you are standing on the threshold of a miracle
a vortex of smoke and light swirls in the middle of the stage
the vortex blazes and suddenly swann sweeps down out of the flies as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering razor toothed dragon emerges in
a cloud of crimson smoke
swann raises his hands above his head and a spear miraculously appears in his grasp
he descends on the dragon
its a classic image st
michael smiting the devil
swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon
the theatre shakes at its dying roars
then the head cracks open and out of the dragons mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed dancers male and female
swann throws down the spear and where it strikes the stage his panther appears
a roar of applause from the audience
swanns plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends
by the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star shot tuxedo
the panther licks his hand in welcome
the music comes to a crescendo
the dancers freeze in their erotic dance
in the sudden hush swann speaks in a whisper
come with me
into the great beyond
a barrage of lights and music erupt
the audience applauds wildly
on harry and dorothea
you havent seen anything yet
the doors squeak as a gust of wind blows through them
butterfield stands in the lobby listening to the muted sounds of music and applause
then he offers his ticket to the ticket collector and steps inside
a new musical motif hangs in the air music announcing danger
the audience watches intently nervously
on harry and dorothea
a whisper this is the new illusion
on stage swann is bound to a spinning wheel while the dancers dressed like boschian demons cavort around him somersaulting and leaping over eruptions of yellow flame
its a scene from daniels inferno
a dozen glittering swords six feet long are descending
he struggles to free himself
the music gets more exciting as the wheel spins faster and faster
suddenly a sword drops
it falls between swanns outstretched legs skewering the wheel
then another close to his head
back to stage
swann is free i he throws off the last shackle and uses it to thrust into the mechanism of the wheel
theres a theatrical blaze of white hot sparks
the wheel slows
he starts to step off it as another of the the swords drops
the audience gasps
swann smiles and trips
as he falls the sword runs through the middle of his back carrying him down to the still spinning wheel and pinning him there
some of the dancers continue to cavort
more gasps from the audience
on harry having a flashback harrys hand turns over the final tar of card
the scene on the stage is that image coming to life
theres something wrong
on swann as a second sword falls skewering his thigh and a third running through his buttock and a fourth and fifth until ten swords have entered his body
on the audience not certain whether this is a trick or not
the music has stopped
in the silence somebody giggles nervously
a couple of people break into applause but it dies away in a matter of moments
on the stage swann raises his head and looks out at his wife his eyes already glassy with imminent death
he reaches out towards her and then sags on the wheel dead
there are gasps now from the audience
murmurs of disgust sobs of horror
its a trick
somebody help him
the curtains start to close
on dorothea tears of shock filling her eyes
to harry ive got to get to him
the audience is rising now as the horror of what theyve seen sinks in
there is panic
a few people have fainted
one or two are even praying
harry carves out a path down to the stage for dorothea against the flood of the exiting crowd
out of the way
out of the way
he helps dorothea onto the stage and lifts the curtain so she can duck beneath it
people running sobbing puking some simply standing watching
valentin is already at the body with the stage manager at his side
to stage manager get then out of here for gods sake you heard him
its not a fucking show
he starts to physically push the crowd back
harry grabs his arm
who are you
harry uses his grip to gently but efficiently move the stage manager out of dorotheas way
she goes to swanns body which has been removed from the wheel
the audience is clearing now
but butterfield is coming towards the stage with an ambiguous look on his face
is he enraged
miller stands at an open door leading below the stage
dorothea kneels at swanns side
a few yards from her harry examines the mechanism of the wheel
a doctor appears
im a doctor
let me through
the doctor checks swanns body
to dorothea im sorry
harry has discovered a cable snaking down beside the device
he slips round to the back of the mechanism and climbs down beneath the stage tracing the cable as he goes
its an eerie shadowy space filled with the props that are used in the show including the dragon we saw at the beginning
from above we hear footsteps and voices muted and echoing
the cable ends in bare wires
whatever was here has been taken
a noise behind harry
he swings round
sees a shadowy figure ducking away
he gives chase
loses the man in the shadows
stops and listens for movement
suddenly miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into harrys face
harry reels back
falls to his knees blood running from his nose
miller pulls harrys gun out of his jacket
got you fucker
harry is facing the dragons head dazed
and now out of the dragons mouth comes butterfield
who did this damour
who killed swann
harry is barely holding on to consciousness
a beat didnt you
why would i do that
butterfield is a foot from harry now
you dont have a clue what youre into do you
butterfield hits him
who did this
i told you butterfield hits him again
who did this
raises his hand all right
butterfield comes a little closer
feigning a near collapse it was
butterfield leans in
and harry grabs him by the balls literally rising as he does so
harry throws butterfield aside
butterfield hits the ground in agony and harry swings round to protect himself from miller whos leveling harrys gun
he fires once missing harry by inches
harry catches hold of a rope underfoot and pulls it tripping miller who topples backwards into the mouth of the dragon
the gun goes off again the bullet blowing apart the dragons jaw miller starts to sit up his body splayed between the dragons steel teeth
he has harry in his sights
he looks up
the dragons jaw is closing fast
he starts to scramble to his feet
the teeth slam closed on his body
harry looks round to see butterfield retreating into the shadows
then hes gone
harry looks down at millers blood which is pooling around his feet
harry sits at eddisons desk looking exhausted and bruised
eddison has just finished taking his statement
and this butterfield guy vanished
frustrated sigh another fucking magician
harry looks past eddison and sees an ashen tearful dorothea being taken into another office
are you finished with me
are you planning to go back to new york
watching dorothea no
dorothea sits alone staring at the wall
are they treating you okay
nods i heard what happened
it looks like somebody murdered him
im sorry i got into this too late
but if you want me to stick around maybe dig where the cops dont look
i dont know where youd start
how about some of the other illusionists
they wont tell you anything
i can be very persuasive
a beat yes
i think you probably can
another beat wed need to talk about your fee
forget the fee
if i find butterfield maybe well talk about money
if i dont
he shrugs my gamble
i get to spend some time
the way he says this its plain here doesnt mean l
it means near dorothea
and by the tiny smile on her face its also plain she knows it
harry now wearing a bandage on his cut face enters
a wonderland for illusionists
books props masks tricks etc
two or three customers browse
harry glances at them all then targets a man in late middle age who is browsing through books one handed
his other hand constantly manipulates a card concealing and revealing it in a dozen ways
he doesnt even look at his hand
his name is walter harry stands beside him
scans the shelf
whered you learn that
i dont know you harry damour
i know all the kids coming up
got to stay ahead of the game
but i dont know you
im in from new york
i came to see swann
what a tragedy
it was just a matter of time of course but its not good for the business
was he taking a lot of risks
you dont know the half of it
im walter wilder by the way
not the walter wilder
the one and only
he hands harry a card
want to try
harry tries to emulate wilders card manipulation through the rest of this conversation
you know vinovich
not a clue sure
he knew swann way back
he says there were a lot of drugs a lot of crazy shit
id love to
hang with some of you guys
people are pretty cagey
who do you know
for an introduction
wilder takes a moment to assess harry who is attempting to manipulate the card hes been given with charming ineptitude
magnanimously you do now
the castle is faux of course but it has a gothic charm
harry and walter wander towards the front door
harry is knotting a newly bought tie
i only wear ties for funerals
you dont get in without one
its like a gentlemens club for illusionists
except most of us arent gentlemen
the interior is murky and atmospheric the walls covered with illusionists posters
walter leads the way through the long corridors past rooms where illusionists are performing close up magic for audiences of well heeled patrons
walter nods and waves to half a dozen people on their way through the house up the stairs and towards the bar
are they all in the business
its not a business
its a vocation
wilder points to a locked door
thats what they call the repository
every magic secret known to mans locked up in that room
have you been in
theres only three keys
vinovich has got one of course
beat hes a little crazy by the way
and hes a mean drunk
otherwise hes a real charmer
a drunken vinovich is holding court
hes in his s a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy and fake middle european accent
at the table besides harry and walter are vinovichs starlet nymphet girlfriend laura an asian american illusionist called billy who and two of vinovichs adoring courtiers an overblown overdressed female
illusionist debra devine and a thin waspish fellow in a spangly suit the amazing quentin
in the conversation that follows we go back to harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group
its more than entertainment
were opening peoples heads up
putting miracles back into their boring little lives
but theyre fake miracles
houdini believed he had spirit guides
you believe that
i think we walk a narrow path between
heaven and hell
vinovich stares hard at harry trying to figure out whether hes being sarcastic or not
trickery and divinity
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real
im saying they were always fake
the saints the messiahs they were just illusionists
so could you walk on water
deadly serious i could reproduce any miracle thats ever been performed with a little preparation
what about swanns miracles
the smug smile on vinovichs face dies
furtive glances are exchanged around the table
only billy who makes a tiny smile
they werent worth a damn
goading i heard he was the best
if he was so good whys he so dead
vinovich begins to look suspicious
you tell me
i thought youd maybe have a theory
oh ive got plenty
id like to hear them
im not saying another word
to wilder you damn fool
hes a journalist
just tell me about swann
or are you too scared
he was a freak
everything he did was tainted
looks straight at vinovich unintimidated
he was evil
to laura come on
to the rest say nothing to this man if you wish to keep my company
he stalks away
harry calls after him across a now silenced bar
great accent by the way
is it brooklyn
pure brooklyn fuck you
harry heads to the car
billy approaches glancing behind him to see that hes not being watched
i gotta be careful
if vinovich sees me talking to you
hes an asshole but hes a powerful asshole
they go together
lowered voice ive heard a name
someone they talk about in whispers
like in nothing
who is he
i think maybe he taught swann
hands harry a card this is me
see ya around
billy hurries away
harry lies on his bed dozing
the camera creeps in on him
i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards
harry frowns in his semi doze
ever watched a man die
the image darkens and fades up a beat later on quaid
i wasnt there
jennifer desiderios disappeared
harry is still asleep
im not afraid to die
theres something terrible
a long silence
suddenly a telephone rings
harry sits up shocked awake
he picks up the receiver
this is damour
she sits up on her bed dressed in a silk robe and nothing else drinking a scotch talking on the phone
the primary source of illumination is the massive t
set in the wall opposite the bed
i know its late
there should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange
both of them on beds in different bedrooms
each aroused by the others voice and frustrated not to be able to see and touch them
as he speaks harry scrawls jennifer desiderio on the title page of the gideons bible beside the bed
how did it go today
i went up to the magic castle
you were right
he didnt have a lot of fans up there
valentin on the kitchen phone is listening in
they were jealous of him
because he had you
didnt have me
i told you you didnt marry him for love
shes a little uncomfortable now
so why did you marry him
thats my business
a beat back to business
ever heard of a man called nix
i dont know the name
what about jennifer desiderio
it doesnt ring a bell
i have to go
ill keep digging
you do that
she puts down the phone and swallows a mouthful of scotch
she gets up
paces the room
then she picks up the phone again
on the pad beside the bed jennifers name surrounded by harrys doodles
the phone rings
cut wide the room is empty
the tarot card and crystal readings sign is dark now
harry heads up the stairs past the photographs to the door of quaids waiting room
it has been locked and taped by the police
harry has come prepared
he takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks
harry enters flashlight on
he crosses the waiting room and enters the fortune telling room where quaid died
on the track a remote eerie presence we hear quaids sobs millers shouts and as harrys flashlight illuminates the blood spattered table if you watch very closely you can sometimes
see the soul escaping
harry is spooked
he starts to search the room opening cabinets and drawers
quaids hordes of mystical bric a brac are stashed everywhere
boxes of crystals religious statues elaborate cards incense etc
he pulls open a drawer and notices that a rosary is wedged in a niche at the base of the drawer
he pulls the drawer out empties its contents on the table and examines it
using the crowbar he forces the drawer apart
it has a false bottom
in the secret compartment some papers and an address book
he flicks to d
there it is
jennifer desiderio and an address
he pockets the book
then sensing a presence behind him he pulls out his gun and whirls around his flashlight beam revealing valentin
what the fuck are you doing here
looking for you
i tried the hotel
whyd you come here
youre a detective with no clues
where else are you going to look
im going to keep this brief
he takes out an envelope heres thirty thousand dollars
a ticket home you didnt hire me
if she wants me off the job i want to hear it from her
she doesnt want to see you
shes had enough pain
enough churning over the past
she wants it all left alone
somebodys been murdered
its regrettable fuck regrettable
i want to know why
you need to stay busy
a confession i like to know why things happen
why people die
shakes his head give it up damour
harry crosses to the door brushing past valentin
dont try and see her damour
just leave her alone
let her heal
he glances back at valentin
lock up will you
on the address book in harrys hands
harry looks up with some surprise not at a house but at a building the sign on which reads st
the place is bland and functional throughout the walls decorated with sun faded reproductions of great paintings
harry is talking to d
toffler black fortyish softly spoken and a nurse
jennifers only ever had one visitor
a mister quaid
and hes dead isnt he
i saw it on the news
jennifer doesnt know
and frankly this isnt the best tine for her to be told
i wont say anything
toffler excorts harry through the place
there are distressing scenes on every side
nothing melodramatic no screaming no fits
just a subtle pervasive air of despair
blank empty faces in blank empty rooms
jennifers been with us four years
she was coming on nicely
but just the last month or so shes worse than ever
whats her problem
she has no real grip on reality
a joke does anybody
deadly serious oh yes
we have to agree whats real and whats not
thats what holds us together
and what does jennifer thinks real
theyve come to french windows which are wide open
sitting outside in the sun is jennifer with her back to us
quietly jennifer thinks the devils coming for her
she looks terrible
harry and jennifer walk amongst the flower beds with the nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance
throughout the scene we hear the sound of earth being dug which steadily gets louder as they walk
have we met before
only i forget
they give me pills you know to keep me
i forget things well you didnt forget me
i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield
what about philip swann
i knew swann
sudden vehemence hes a fucking liar
a workman saunters past carrying pipes
he said he knew how to protect us
but he didnt know anything
he made us think it was over and done with
tears nearing i dont want to think about it
if i think about it hell hear me
hell find me
ahead now the site where the workmen are digging a hole laying pipes
the camera doesnt focus on this action but were aware of it
i told you
i dont she stops
looks ahead of her
her face is suddenly ashen and clammy
harry follows her gaze to the hole
somebody is in it digging
earth emerges in shovelfuls piling up beside the hole
screaming god no
oh god no
she backs away from the hole
the nurse grabs hold of her
she delivers the nurse a backhand swipe
the nurse is flung back
hes not going to get me
she races down towards the street
harry goes after her
he catches up with her
is he the puritan
and hes dead
hes coming back
hes digging his way out
the nurse appears behind harry
ill take care of her now
jennifer struggles in harrys grip
let go of her mr
the nurse breaks harrys hold on jennifer who slips away instantly racing towards the street
she scrambles up over a wall and flings herself from the top
theres a screech of brakes then the smashing of metalwork and glass
harry gets to the wall before the nurse
hoists himself up onto it
jennifer is dead in the middle of the street beneath the wheels of a car
the driver is out and yelling incoherently
he slips back down the wall and leans against it
he looks towards the hole
the workman has stopped digging
his mud encrusted hands emerge and for a moment before his head appears the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave
harry closes his eyes
very quietly jesus
the sun is setting the city giving way to night
harrys on the phone
i want to speak to dorothea
im afraid shes not in
when will she be in
valentin on the phone in the study
who is it
valentin puts the phone down
ill get the number changed
no word from damour
valentin shakes his head
its better hes gone
he would have done more harm than good
harm to whom
i dont think so
try him again at the hotel
i left three messages already
dorothea nods plainly sad at harrys desertion
she turns and leaves the room
on billy whos card in harrys hand
on phone billy
suppose i wanted to get into the repository at the magic castle
youve done this before
ive had my moments
harrys manipulating the lock
im sure theyll have this place rigged
itll be something hokey
the door opens
houdinid been proud of you
undusted shelves piled high with manuscripts old books and posters in every direction
on the wall plaster life masks
in glass cases the tools of the great magicians knives keys guns wands even an iron maiden
billy is in awe
he wanders around wide eyed while harry scans the shelves
the dialogue runs as they investigate
i hear mrs
swanns quite a babe
you heard right
you ever been married
she was killed in a car crash
her lawyer was driving
she was filing for divorce
my life was too weird for her
grinning i love weird
harry has seen a small sigil carved onto one of the shelves
this was on millers forehead
any idea what it is
harry presses it
the entire bookcase opens up creaking
what did i tell you
so fucking hokey
inside there is a small shelf
on it files and papers
what have we got here
ever eager billy steps into the recess
and two spiked latticed gates close on his arm
harry grabs the gates before they snap closed inches from skewering billys flesh and bone
he keeps them open his sinews straining
grab the files
billy reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files
as he steps out of range
harry lets go and the gates close with a jesus
he slams the files down
i could have lost my fucking hands
that would have kept you out of the magic circle
he studies the files which was presumably the idea
a beat these are about nix
harry takes a sheaf of papers and hands them to billy
you go through these
reluctantly billy does so
harry picks up a faded photograph of the doorway to nixs house with the sigil painted on it and butterfield the child standing in the sun
there are other cultists standing around
and in the doorway a barely visible figure and all the more intimidating for that is nix
wait a minute
he stares at the boys face
the eyes are clearly different colours
points to nan in doorway and whos that
on harry staring at the ambiguous presence
on the photograph of the shadowy figure
at a guess
billy picks up an etching water stained and dirty
it shows a horror we recognize a mans hand pressed into the flesh of another mans head
take a look at this
looking at it a nix specialty
billy is getting subtly spooked now
he puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series
we glimpse them as he does so
in one a man regurgitates a serpentine form made of flame
in another a man stares at his own hand which is stripped of flesh
there is no bone beneath
only a form of solid blackness
in a third we see a head with a slit in the middle of the brow emanating i dont know any of these tricks
harry studies the etchings
a slow burn maybe theyre not tricks
mystified i mean theres no instructions realizes what harry said what do you mean theyre not tricks
what did vinovich say
something about walking a path between trickery and divinity
yeah he says that all the time
thats because he knew
hed seen these files and knew
out of the corner of his eye
harry sees a motion between the book stacks
harry puts his fingers to his lips
gestures for billy to take cover
billy backs away
harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion
something eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks
a figure in a straight jacket with his head bowed
harry takes out his gun
billy disappears around the back of one of the stacks
harry goes after the apparition
the track is completely silent
suddenly the creature appears behind billy
it looks up its face that of a psychotic burning eyes manic smile
it tears open its straight jacket and reaches for billy who backs away
books tumble on top of billy as he stumbles against the shelves
where the fuck are you
harry appears and puts his gun to the psychos head
hold it right there
the gun goes through the psychos skull as though its made of smoke
harry waves his hands through it
its completely ethereal
but its still terrorizing billy
in mortal terror get it off me
harry glances around
sees a light flickering between some books
fires at it
the light goes out
the psycho vanishes
billy is left hyper ventilating on the ground
hokey enough for you
im out of here man
are you coming
harry picks up a handful of papers from the nix file
billy is already out of the room
for a moment
harry pauses to look back at the other files sealed behind the spiked gates
as he does so the proiector sparks into life one last time and the psycho appears roaring at harrys shoulder
he fires at the projector a second time
on the gun shot billy and harry are parting
a beat actually no
this was enough
they shake and part
harry waits on the doorstep
valentin opens the door
quietly i cant let you in
stepping in yeah i know
you want more money is that it
harry pushes him aside
harry starts to go through the house opening doors
he sees candle light through a partially open door
starts towards it
leave her alone shut up
he pushes open the door
the room is a museum of swarms career
posters and memorabilia everywhere
and in the middle of the room swanns sealed casket surrounded by flowers and candles
dorothea is standing beside it head bowed
this is the way he wanted it
no autopsy no embalming
nobody meddling with his body
harry approaches slowly
flesh is a trap
thats what he used to say
flesh is a trap and magic sets us free
a beat why did you come back
i didnt leave
i was just digging around
dorothea looks up at him
uneasy what did you find
jennifer desiderio for one
he watches her for a response she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon
dorothea cant disguise her distress
a beat why dont you tell me the truth
dorothea pours herself a drink while harry spreads the photos and the papers from the repository on the table
nix ran some kind of cult right
some kind of charlie manson deal
it was more than that i think
he was the real thing right
swann said he could do stuff yes
he could get into peoples heads
make them see things
and he could levitate
he taught all this to swann
some or it
valentin is listening at the door
so swann was performing magic
dorothea nods and what
you thought he should be using it to cure cancer not making millions
i told you too much fame
yeah i guess thatd turn anybodys head
you said you werent with him for love
i was grateful to him
i owed him my life
and he loved me
he couldnt always show it but he felt it
he thought nix was coming back didnt he
dorothea is pouring herself another drink
the glass slips from her hand
harry goes to help her
they stoop together very close
the sexual attraction is almost palpable
dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass
they are very close to each other
reassuring its okay
no it isnt
you cant help me
tenderly im here arent i
he kisses her
she kisses him back hard
nothings going to happen to you
smiles nothing you dont want
they kiss again passionately
valentin breaks into the shadows as harry and dorothea cross the darkened lobby and head upstairs
then valentin crosses to the phone and dials
a room of illusions
walls lined with mirrors and warm flattering lighting bathing the naked forms of dorothea and harry as they make love sitting on the floor
it is a deeply passionate but slow sensual coupling
valentin opens the front door
theres a wind blowing
the palms churn against the night sky
roiling wind filled pains with the glistening urgent bodies of harry and dorothea
harry cradles dorothea in post coital languor
whispers i was so afraid
nix cant hurt you now
are you sure
kisses her hes dead
im the one who shot him
hes startled to say the least
i was twelve
nix took me hostage to get swann to come to him
realizing and they all came
quaid and jennifer and pimm and swann
only nix was ready for them
theres a noise downstairs
nervous what was that
harry slips out of bed
harry descends the stairs buttoning up his trousers which is all he wears
he has his gun
dorothea appears behind him
harrys at the bottom of the stairs now
across the hall in a passageway an eerie silhouette
we can make out no detail of clothing or face
what the hell
suddenly the shadowy figure comes at harry
a blast of energy bursts against harrys face
as it breaks against his skin we see for three frames or so a glimpse of harrys skull
in pain aah
harry fires at the figure
the shadows fold up around the stranger like an origami puzzle
harry goes out into the passageway
get some lights on
as if in reply to the command a burst of vivid white fire erupts behind harry
he swings round to see the stranger unfolding out of the shadows again defying physics and physiology to do so
the fire is at his feet like a serpent writhing on the ground
it comes at harry
harry fires at it but it comes at him faster still rising to burn harrys leg
he retreats the fire racing after him
he makes for a door and flings it open
hes in the fire follows him across the ground and strikes his hand
harry drops the gun
looks up to see the stranger in the doorway arm raised to will the fire serpent on
but then he hesitates
harry glances round and sees that the stranger whose face is still a dark smear is staring at the casket
somebody you know
dorothea appears behind the stranger
sees harry burned and sweating cornered against the casket
oh my god
the stranger looks round
harry snatches up the gun supporting his burned hand with his good hand
levels the gun at the stranger
the fire raises its head like a cobra
which goes first
my face or your heart
the stranger draws a deep breath
the fire serpent withers and dies
who in gods name are you
she reaches for the stranger who simply folds up again gone into darkness
the wind blows through the house masking his exit
are you all right
get him in here
harry takes one of the candle holders and jams it under the casket lid
he starts to force off the lid
valentin and dorothea enter
what are you doing
this is sacrilege
he starts towards harry
dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm
her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread as harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls
inside swanns corpse
are you satisfied now
harry holds valentin back with one hand and puts his finger into the corpses mouth
its all right
its not hurting
he now has four fingers in swanns mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw
it cracks and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex
plaster doesnt bleed
he tosses the jaw to valentin
to dorothea it looks like youre not a widow after all
harry interrogates valentin in a white fury while dorothea binds harrys hand
you rigged the illusion to fail right
you paid off the doctor
you set up the fake body
because i was getting too close to something at dorothea or someone you called swann i tried to pay you off
was that swanns idea
it was mine
i didnt want any more bloodshed
thats why we went to all this trouble so thered be no one for nix to come after
nix is dead and buried for fucks sake
havent you seen enough to know that doesnt matter
he looks as though hes beginning to think maybe nixs resurrection is plausible
i want to see swann face to face
why dont you leave this alone
let everybody think its over
what about me
nix was never interested in you
it was always swann
to dorothea maybe valentins right
we should let it alone
a bell starts to toll cont
he went to all that trouble to be dead
maybe we should let him stay that way
the tolling carries over into we crane down from a high angle on a grave surrounded by mourners
the graveside service has just ended and the mourners are beginning to disperse
dorothea is there amongst them of course
so are several faces we recognize vinovich wilder billy who swanns stage manager his dancers his technicians
there are also several members of the press and thirty or fourty other mourners some of whom to judge by their dress and manner are also illusionists
harry stands some distance from the crowd watching hidden from the doorway of a mausoleum
his eyes are on dorothea as she goes amongst the mourners receiving unheard words of condolesence
the standee of swann is being demolished by two workers
they are taking hammers to it smashing it to pieces
the stage is starkly lit with working lights the auditorium in darkness
swanns equipment including the partially dismantled dragons head is heaped on the stage
valentin wanders through the boxes to the place where swann died
he stares down at the blood on the stage
the st worker throws the cut out head of swanns standee down into the street
on the head as it strikes the sidewalk at somebodys feet
we dont see who
harry catches sight of somebody close to the gates of the cemetery
dark glasses a beard an anonymous black suit
harry smiles slightly and slips off between the mausoleums
the black coated mourner gets into his car
on harry as he gets into his
valentin hears something in the auditorium
he reaches into his jacket to draw a gun
theres a noise
he swings round
butterfield has a scalpel at his throat
he kicks valentin to the ground
conversationally ive sometimes thought if id had another profession i would have been a surgeon
on valentin staring up in terror
of butterfield upside down above him the scalpel glittering
to be able to heal with one little cut
on valentin again as butterfields blade touches his cheek just beneath his eye
lets say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble
i could scoop them out
so tell me where nix is buried
i dont know
butterfield pushes the blade into valentins skin
cut wide as valentin thrashes his face obscured by butterfields body
on valentin again
there is a small cut beneath his eye but thats all
ill tell you
youll do more
a bad neighborhood to judge by the state of the streets
harry gets out of his car and crosses to a gate topped with barbed wire
he peers through the bars
of the stranger from the funeral disappearing into the building
he glances back towards the street
we get a glimpse of a bearded face beneath the brim of his hat
harry slides out of sight
waits until the stranger has gone inside
then hes up over the gate braving the barbed wire
its been a hospital
now the echoing corridors and wards are deserted littered with reminders of old suffering
rotting mattresses spilled boxes of surgical supplies
harry explores this tiled labyrinth looking for some sign of the stranger
he enters a shadowy room
birds fly up into his face
as he retreats another sound a little distance from him
gun in hand he heads towards it and steps into narrow shafts of light through the circular viewing window fall on an operating table and looming pieces of discarded equipment
harry scans the shadows as he advances into the room
i knew you wouldnt be able tn stay away
harry notices the beard and glasses on the operating table
you had to see who wept for you the most
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover youre still alive
theyll never find out
harry looks up
svanrt is hovering in the air above him
the veins in his temples bulge and throb
this trick requires a lot of concentration
look ma no wires
you shouldnt have followed me damour
how the fuck do you do that
now im going to have to kill you
i dont think so
you need me alive
so you can fuck my wife
swann swoops down towards harry who levels his gun
funerals make me trigger happy
swann stops inches from the ground
you know its such a fucking waste
you can do shit most of us can only dream about and you go around pretending its some trick
las vegas contracts damour
magicians get burned
or murdered like nix
he deserved it
maybe he doesnt see it that way
maybe hes digging his way out of the hole you put him right now
thats what youre hiding away from isnt it
i did it for dorothea
now that im dead the spotlights off her
harry grabs swann literally pulling him down to earth
now theyre face to face
eye to eye
swann for all his posturing is afraid
so nix wont come looking for her
its me betrayed him
and she shot him i i think thatd piss me off if i were nix
despairing i dont know what else to do
on swann his face a churning mass of rage and fear
if hes back from the dead then he is some kind of god
and hell find you wherever the fuck you are
and if hes just another phony messiah then you can stage the greatest come back in history
this doesnt sound like such a terrible idea
a car comes to a halt outside the house where six vehicles are already gathered
the snake handling cultist gets out
snakes seethe out of the open car door
we move through the shadowy interior catching sight of several cultists as we go
they all have looks of barely suppressed ecstasy on their faces
we are moving towards the sanctum and its getting darker
a match is struck and an oil flame sputters into life
we see normans gleaming face
on the wall is a picture of nix floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction
norman brushes away thirteen years accrual of dirt
beneath nixs expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever
a small garishly lit liquor store
harrys car pulls into the lot
swann gets out his disguise back on
heads into the store
harry agitated and impatient follows him
swann is at the cashiers desk with a bottle of cheap brandy
is this the best brandy youve got
if thats whats on the shelves
swann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air
can you change a thousand for me
amazed youre shittin me
can we go
swann starts to cough
a quarter falls from his mouth
will that do
swann coughs again
puts his hand to his mouth
a deluge of quarters runs between his fingers
the cashier gapes
the house could not look more reassuringly calm
a swan struts beside the pool
a long hushed moment
a baboon shrieks its mouth filling the frame
cut wide to reveal the baboon racing around nixs sanctum crazed
hanging on the sculpture that swings from the roof is a shadowy figure
is it nix
we cant quite see
black blood runs from the figure and splashes on the ground
now we see dorothea being pulled by the cultists towards the falling gouts of dark fluid she struggles sobbing she tosses around on the bed dorothea has a gun in
the cultists shake it from her grip and pull her directly under the blood as it splashes on her upturned face a sound
dorothea wakes distressed by the dream
she gets up and goes out onto looks down the stairs
then valentin speaks behind her
blood runs from his cut face
what did you do to your face
it was me
hes on her in a heartbeat pressing her back against the wail
guess who were going to see
swann takes a throatful of brandy
then he stares at harry
you think im an asshole
didnt know you read minds
a warning i can do a lot of shit damour
but you know that
an apology so i like playing games with people
gives them something to wonder about
is that all
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes
its like a public service
it doesnt mean much in the end
theyre all going to die
and youre not
silence for a moment
oh i was going to discover the secret of the universe
thats why i liked nix
he promised me all these explanations
and he didnt have them
he had something
he showed me how to bend the rules
a little levitation
a few fireworks
is that all
a beat at the end
when we had him cornered he got into my head
he showed me what we really look like when the veneers gone
and you believed him
i saw it with my own fucking eyes
see thats his best trick
just the truth
he looks at harry are you ready for that
harry grabs the brandy bottle from swann
pan down from the palms to harrys car outside the front door
harry puts his head in the study the library the bedroom
now hes on the landing
shes not here
harry spots valentins blood on the carpet
did she know where nix was buried
who else did
butterfields sedan crosses the desert under a sky full of stars
butterfield and dorothea are in the back
dorothea is handcuffed
he has a bag open at his feet
one by one he takes out a series of extraordinary instruments
dorothea looks on confounded
like the look of these
i made them myself to set him free
why did you wait so long
i didnt have the skill to resurrect him
i had to teach myself
and that took time
and you think hell be in a fit state to resurrect after thirteen years
if he was just a man like me then no
but hes not
what is he
maybe hell show you
on dorothea terror in her eyes
now there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house
through the windows the flickering of oil lamp flames
there is a low ominous chant floating from the house
it has no words but it is steadily building in intensity
we drift towards the front door
now we move down the passageway to the meditation room
inside seventeen cultists kneel in a circle
they are all cutting off their hair and throwing it into the fire that blazes in the centre of the circle
they hack indiscriminately with knives scissors and razors their eyes wild
blood runs down their faces and necks from nicked ears and scalps
and still the chant builds and builds
he will come
he will come
he will come
a few rocks and emptiness
the headlamps of butterfields sedan burn in the darkness illuminating the dig
valentin is in the grave digging
on butterfield as he stands at the edge of the hole watching the work
dorothea stands a yard or two behind him
butterfield squats at the edge of the hole and suddenly reaches out for valentin hauling him close
if youve lied to me to me i swear
this is the place swann told me about
on dorothea who uses butterfields distraction to take a few steps back towards the open car door
of butterfield back to her interrogating valentin
five more minutes
and youd better not a sound behind him
butterfield wheels round
on the ground beside the open car door the instruments
what the fuck are you playing at
he goes to pick them up
dorothea steps from behind the door with the sharpest in her hand
she slashes at him
opens a wound across his arm
he comes at her suddenly striking the instrument from her hand and slamming her against the car
he hits her
butterfield goes to the edge of the grave picks up the flashlight and trains the beam on valentin
blinded in the corner
the beam goes to the corner of the grave
a mummified hand is sticking out of one of the walls
to valentin keep away from it
butterfield jumps down into the grave and goes to the hand
the track is silent but for butterfields shallow breath
he reaches out to touch nix s fingers
he touches the hand and the wall of sand comes down with a he jumps back as nixs corpse his head still sealed by the mask rolls into view
reverentially its him
on dorothea sliding down the car in despair
the car is static the engine still running
they got here before us
looks that way
harry gets out of the car and starts towards the open grave
harry reaches the graves edge
its totally dark
he peers in
on his heel as the ground crumbles beneath his weight
harry slides into the grave
hes in darkness now
he gets to his feet and starts to try and scramble out
suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder
harry swings round
he has been badly cut up
he collapses into harrys arms
indecision is written all over swanns face to help or not to help
swann goes to the graveside terrified
give me a hand
i got valentin
together harry and swann lift valentin out of the grave and lay him in the blaze of the headlamps
hes got dorothea
weve got to get you to a hospital
weve lost enough lives already
im sorry damour
looks like youre going
hes better off this way
furious nobodys better off this wav
you dont get it do you
he puts his foot beneath valentins body
it rolls back into nixs grave
thats where were all going
in my time and nobody elses
on the empty grave as we hear the sound of harry and swann getting into the car
the doors slam
the car lights retreat
the grave is left to darkness
the house is silent now
we track through the house
the cultists all seventeen of them stand in the passageways looking toward nixs sanctum
on the sanctum door
he is wearing white now
do you wish him to be amongst us
will you come to him on your knees
now we see that the cultists have bottles in their hands
with looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces they smash the bottles to the ground at their bare feet
then they pick up more bottles and smash them littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of glass
on butterfield smiling
he steps back into the sanctum
high wide shot of the room as butterfield approaches the body of nix
it lies on a table surrounded by bowls of oil
bandages soaked in oil are laid over its limbs
beside its head butterfields instruments are laid out
on dorothea crouched in the corner of the room terrified as she watches butterfield remove the multi part mask screwed into nixs face
he works with surgical precision
youve got everything you want
you dont need me
a piece of the mask comes away from the cheek
a subtle power plucks at dust around the room disturbing it minutely
we cut close to dorotheas face throughout this sequence on occasion her eyeball fills the screen as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether growing in magnitude
no but he will
after what you did to him
he pulls a piece of the mask from nixs mouth
hell want vengeance
simple ps that
the bottle breaking has ceased
the cultists stand breathless with anticipation
on nixs emaciated mouth
the lips twitch
the dust moves around her
and nix draws breath
on butterfield tears in his eyes
oh my lord
hes coming home
the whisper runs through the congregation hes coming home
he s coming home
on dorothea eyes wide
christ in heaven
on nix as his body starts to thirstily soak up the oils
his withered flesh starts to rehydrate his veins start to butterfield is watching the process in amazement
nixs hands move up to his face where the last portion of the mask is still screwed over his eyes
hes with us
hes with us
hes with us
unnoticed by butterfield who has his eyes on nix dorothea gets to her feet and creeps away to the door
very quiet suddenly the snake handling cultist steps into view snakes coiled around his face and fingers
butterfield looks up
on nix as he starts to pull at the mask on his face
it comes away with a moist wrenching sound
at last we see his eyes
the candle lights blaze blinding his sensitive eyes
fury to agony aaarrrgh
he gets up and flings himself around the room knocking over all the lights but two
then he strikes butterfield to the ground and slams his foot on butterfields neck knocking him unconscious
its a terrifying almost demoniacal display of instant physical superiority
throughout he literally roars in rage
the cultists scream in sympathy letting out years of repressed frustration
many of them are dancing on the shards of glass now crazed
harrys car is parked a quarter mile from nixs house
he is getting out
swann stays put
the sound of screaming is carried towards them on the wind
what the hells going on in there
at a guess
they just resurrected him
harry starts towards the house
after a beat swann gets out of the car and follows
on butterfield as nix removes his foot
butterfield is out for the count
on nix as he stops screaming
his face is grotesquely disfigured by the mask the flesh stained and corrupted
the screaming of the cultists is dying away
the cultists all face the sanctum door awaiting instruction
will you suffer to come unto me
one by one the cultists fall to their knees
we never see flesh pierced by broken glass
but we hear it and see the agony on the cultists faces
they start to sob
then nix appears in the doorway mostly hidden by shadow
ive come back to share the wisdom of the grave
will you hear it
follow me then
he steps out of the doorway
the cultists let out sobs of adoration
nix locks at dorothea
do i know you child
he reaches for her
pulls her close to his body
dorothea keeps her self possession but only just
i do dont i
no gun this time child
a beat wheres swann
i dont know where he is
nix picks her up so that her feet are inches off the ground
weve got unfinished business he and i
then he carries her down the passageway to the meditation room walking on the glass apparently indifferent to the wounds hes receiving
the cultists follow
nix strides into the middle of the room
whispered to dorothea something terribles going to happen
but if you hold on to me very tight you may live a little longer
the cultists enter the room knees and hands bloody
to cultists are you ready for my wisdom
harry pushes open the window and climbs in
he is frozen by the memory of what happened here
on swann as the track fills with eerie echoes of that terrible event
the gun shots
the sound of the screws grinding into nixs flesh
in terrified awe this is where we killed him
looking at table you didnt try hard enough
i cant go any further
harry nods and gently detaches his arm from swanns panicked grip
he crosses to the door
butterfield reaches out of the darkness and catches hold of harrys leg
throwing him to the ground
he has one of the instruments in his hand
he stabs at harry striking the ground between harrys legs
here is my wisdom
he stamps on the ground
cracks spread from his foot in all directions
on the cultists amazed by this manifestation of power
yes show us
with a roar a pit four or five feet across opens up beneath nix and dorothea
nix hovers over it
its utterly dark perhaps bottomless
hearing dorotheas cry harry looks back towards the passageway
butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at harry a second time
but swann catches hold of his arm
to harry whatever hes doing to her stop him
and harrys up and away he dashes over the glass on nix dorothea clasped close to him
he revolves as he floats over the chasm below then
to unseen cultists you see i escaped the grave
so i have to give something to the grave in return
on the cultists listening to their lord with love in their eyes
a slit opens in the middle of nixs forehead above the bridge of his nose this is an image we saw in the prints in the library and from it
comes a wave of darkness
as nix revolves the darkness strikes the ground around the cultists
at first they dont realize whats going on
they think this is some kind of bizarre blessing
then the ground starts to liquify beneath them
i have to give something back
so im giving you
theyre starting to scream now as they sink into the ground
they struggle of course but the earth seems to be hungry for them
they are dragged down thrashing as they sink
youre not worthy
none of you
only swann was worthy
you just waited like lambs
harry appears in the doorway
nix still swinging round has his back to harry
well im not your shepherd
harry surveys the horrific scene in front of him
the ground is now re solidifying around the cultists some of whom have disappeared from view completely some of whom still reach up out of the dirt
the scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror
screaming faces locked in the solid ground
twitching hands the same
harry starts towards nix and dorothea gun levelled
so far he has avoided nixs gaze
butterfield and swann are locked in a life or death struggle
they tumble back against the table upon which nix was resurrected
it collapses under them and for a moment swann is stunned
butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and stabs at swann who rolls out of the way in the nick of time
the blade catches him in the arm however
go on bleed
he slashes at swann again go on
butterfield comes after him and swann backs off against a wall
he spits out a serpentine flame which races across the floor and leaps at butterfields face
he falls backwards his face on fire
swann doesnt wait to watch him die but races out into the passageway blood running from his wound
harry is staring up at dorothea as he very gingerly crosses the still sticky ground
hes a yard from the edge of the pit now
nix swings round
youre not swann
who are you
a beat oh
i know what you want
he lets dorothea slip from his arms
harry flings himself towards the hole and catches hold of dorotheas arm before she falls away into the abyss
his gun goes spinning across the ground back towards the door leading to the passageway
nix reaches down to torment harry
but before he can make contact nix
nix looks up
there you are
suddenly nix isnt interested in harry and dorothea
he steps onto solid ground and walks towards swann his tone suddenly conversational
ive had a lot of time to think about you
where i went wrong
with nixs back turned harry pulls dorothea back out of the chasm
i should have been honest with you right from the start
i wasnt born to show people the error of their ways
i was born to murder the world
on harry as he leads dorothea to the door
harry glances back into the room
you could still help me do that
why would i want to
because youve got nothing else to live for
the woman has a new love in her life
your friends are dead
nobodys left to save you but me he lays his hands on swann
draws him into an embrace
on harry and dorothea
to dorothea ive got to help him
nix has got to have a weak spot
everybodys got a fucking weak spot
he turns and suddenly butterfield is there
his face is horribly burned but hes still very much alive
he launches himself at harry driving them both back into the broken glass
a fight ensues carrying them out into the passageway
nix has swann in a bear hug
will you help me
then swann nods
nix lets him go
you know ill kill you when were done
i have to
but until then
its you and me
the way it always was
dorothea at the doorway watches this bizarre exchange
swanns eyes flicker towards her
you still feel something for that bitch
nix makes a gesture and swann is flung against the wall pinned there like a fly legs off the ground
with each word nix almost casually throws a gesture in swanns direction and though there is six feet between them they have the force of terrible blows
one to the ribs
one to the face
one to the legs one to the arms
they all break
then nix turns towards dorothea
shes just flesh swannnie boy
ill show you
he moves towards dorothea
swann falls to the ground broken
the fight between butterfield and harry continues
harry looks up
sees dorothea retreating from the door and running off into the darkness
butterfield comes at harry again
harrys got no more time for this creep
he delivers butterfield a backhand swipe and butterfield lands face down in the glass
we dont see the impact
hearing its enough
harry looks down at the body
then where is she
nix is on him like a luoaernaut
treading on butterfields body as he comes at harry
where did she go
nix grabs hold of harrys head with one hand and presses the fingers of the other hand against harrys temples
he struggles to get free but nix is simply too powerful
nixs fingers slowly slide beneath the skin of harrys temples
as before theres no blood
youve got swanns disease
you think a little courage a little love and itll all be all right
his fingers slide all the way in
harry wrests himself free of nix and stumbles away
his eyes are blood red
nix is a few yards behind him
tell me where she is
and ill make it go away
harry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare
the apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move
a face screams
on harry verging on insanity
harry sees a woman wrapped in the sickly sensual embrace of some glistening barely visible obscenity
we cant see her face
only her mouth is visible in the coils of her devourer
as he approaches the wall on which this woman is painted
reaching out for the image
the woman reaches for harry
as he touches the wall
he starts to scratch out the plaster on which the image is painted
darkness swallows the image of the woman
she is still screaming when she disappears
on swann dragging his broken body to the door
literally beating his head against the wall
dare he believe this is truly her voice
its not real harry harry turns around
dorothea is there
for a moment he sees dorothea as she is
on harry relief flooding his face
then the image morphs
dorotheas beauty is replaced by primeval muck
on harry appalled
dorothea grabs hold of him
listen to me
whatevers good between us believe it
harrys face is deathly white and pouring sweat
hes fighting the delirium
or doing his best
im here harry
nix steps from the shadows of the doorway behind harry
to dorothea there you are child
harry starts to look round
come on child
i want swann to see you die
harry turns and looks at nix
nixs face darkens as it morphs
and the flesh in the middle of his brow unfolds revealing a dark pulsating third eye
to harry what are you looking at
on dorothea who has gone to the door of the meditation room and now slips inside
on harry staring up at nix
on dorothea re emerging from the meditation room
in her hand harrys gun
harry looks round at her
points to his brow there
on nix as he looks up at dorothea
on dorothea as she raises the gun
the bullet strikes nixs forehead
he sinks to his knees blood pouring down his face from the hole where his third eye used to be
on harry as nixs mind hold falters
he leans against the wall shaking
harry opens his eyes
looks up at her
the last of the morphing fades
he sees dorothea as she actually is
dorothea goes down to comfort him and they embrace
suddenly a roar from nix
they look towards him it isnt over
one last terrifying transformation is overtaking nix as he kneels in the glass
his sallow flesh is running in streams up his body towards the dark hole in the middle of his forehead one
his humanity is disappearing vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound
oh my god
harry and dorothea start to get up
nix is no longer human
he is a shape of gleaming darkness stripped of features
he opens his mouth the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw which looses an utterly inhuman shriek
harry glances through the door into the meditation room
swann is on the threshold
nix rises now
he is a terrifying spectacle his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form
he comes at dorothea who has no choice but to back away into the meditation room
the pit still yawns in the middle of the floor
dorothea is backed towards it by nix
when nix speaks his voice is not remotely human
it is i am the purest of the pure
i am the darkest of the dark
harry is at the door now starting towards nix
you cant kill him
harry crouches beside swann
whispers he did something with the ground
can you do it
i dont know
shes a couple of yards from the pit now
im beyond heaven
im beyond hell
suddenly harry lunges at nix grabbing hold of his legs
on swann who puts his hands on the ground
closes his eyes
a wave of liquification runs through the ground from swanns broken fingers the cultists bodies move in the softening ground like corpses in surf and roll towards the pit their
dead faces resurfacing barbaras body floats past nix and disappears over the edge of the pit
to dorothea get out of here
the ground is very liquid now and the corpses are lodging around nix as theyre all carried towards the pit
sos harry of course
nix tries to get up but hes too late
the corpses weigh him down the ground is too fluid for him to get a proper hold and harry still clings to his legs
hes at the edge of the pit
harry looks round
dorotheas behind him risking the flowing ground to offer him a hand
nix starts to fall into the pit
at the last minute he reaches for harry as harry is pulled out of reach bv dorothea
together they stumble to the door where swann still lies
they look back to see nix as he goes over the edge of the pit and falls screaming
at the door dorothea lifts up swanns head
she closes his eyes
what we are about to witness is the longest fall to his death by any villain in the history of cinema
nix is falling through rock
he crashes against a layer of stone which his body smashes to smithereens
and as he falls is it finished
i think so
no its not
nix keeps falling breaking through another layer of rock as he descends deeper and deeper into the earth
theres a hint of fiery light below
hes approaching magma
she puts her arms around him
kisses him sobbing with relief
nix hits a layer of molten rock and screaming he disappears
a burst of dark roiling energy erupts from the spot where he sank and starts up the pit the room trembles
theres a roar in the earth
what the fuck
they race for the front door the wave of energy like a howling dark wind ascends at a breath taking rate harry and dorothea race for the open air as
the energy erupts from the pit
harry and dorothea stumble out into the night the energy howls from room to room eroding the images off the walls blowing out the doors destroying all the resurrection equipment
in the sanctum harry and dorothea stumble to the car
they look back at the house as the cacophony of destruction dies down
on the rim of the sun as it peeps over the desert horizon
the sunlight creeps through the rooms as the dust settles
the hole in the floor closes up and is sealed
harry and dorothea get into the car
harry glances back at the house
quietly its finished
on the idols and the front door virtually destroyed by tine
