written by diablo cody anita needy lesnicki sits on her hospital bed in pajamas
shes a plain faced girl with a haunted expression
as she stares out the window she winds colored yarn around a pair of popsicle sticks to create a gods eye
out a single window we see an imposing nine foot next to needy we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor
there are letters packages even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring fans
every day i get letters
i think i get more letters than santa claus zac efron and dr
im kind of the shit
raymundo a counselor raps on the door and sticks his head in cautiously
rec time in five minutes needy
grassy ass raymundo
needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform
as she slips off her pajamas we can see a series of puffy slash like scars on her body
sometimes the letters are from people who say theyre praying for me
they tell me everything will be okay if i just accept jesus christ into my heart
i say the words but nothing ever happens
nobody comes back
nobody gets off the cross
she glances sadly at a photo of a boy on her dresser
she touches the frame wistfully her eyes full of remorse
occasionally i get presents from starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or something
they think they can take me away from all this
like id really date some perverted chester with a hard on for jailbait
i might be insane but im not desperate
we see a morbid hall of fame of creepy photos sent in from guys
they line the mirror grinning at us
theres even a dick shot tucked in there
needy pulls on her threadbare uniform t shirt
it hangs down to her knees covering her shorts
a lot of people ask me if im sorry i did it
needy picks up a paper cup of colorful pills on her dresser dumps the meds into her mouth and dry swallows them
im sorry i didnt do it sooner
she saunters out of the room in her gym uniform and bunny several badminton courts are set up in the gym
as an intense operatic aria plays over the public address system the female patients enthusiastically almost violently whack at the flying shuttlecocks
the patients appear to be varying levels of crazy
a toothless woman grins as she dives with her racket clipping her partner in the leg
in the corner one forlorn patient nurses her injured arm while another hurls her racket against the wall again and again
counselors look on approvingly despite how miserable their charges appear
in the background a few sulking patients jump rope
needy enters the gym unnoticed padding along in her bunny slippers
welcome to the mental olympics
theyre big on recreation here
supposedly it helps us vent our aggressions
weve traded in our hatchets for rackets our drain o bombs for double dutch
even the cutters get in on the action when theyre fully conscious
we see a girl swinging a jump rope who has a ladder of fresh bandages on her arms and legs
im just trying to stay invisible
nelly shuffles over to a tetherball and takes a furious whack at it
the freshly showered patients assemble for breakfast
they grab trays and settle into noisy cliques
needy selects a single toaster pastry from the breakfast line and sits down alone
personally i think theyre trying to wear us out
keep us sluggish so there wont be an uprising
well those j
tactics wont work against me
im a kicker
k i c k e r
it even says so on my chart
we briefly cut to needys chart on some doctors clipboard
we see her name anita needy lesnicki and a few brief details about first degree murder and grandiose notions
beneath that we see a triple highlighted warning in bright ink kicker
a nutritionist with a clipboard approaches needy casually and eyes her breakfast plate
just one toastem huh
i like toastems
but im not sure a toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day
id recommend more complex carbohydrates
needy scrambles to her feet and delivers a sudden powerful roundhouse kick to the nutritionists face
the nutritionist is knocked off her feet as if shes been kicked by a far mightier creature than needy and collapses clutching her bleeding nose
we see that the bone has snapped
the patients shriek
as needy is restrained by staff members she thrashes like a trapped fish
needy snorts up a killer loogie and hocks it at the prone nutritionist
the glob nails her in the eye
it takes four staff members to haul needy away as she hollers in protest
the nutritionist curls up on the floor cupping her bleeding nose as a ring of curious patients surrounds her
she spits out a tooth
needy is tossed into seclusion
her hair is wild and her face is wet with tears
the heavy door slams behind her leaving only a shaft of light
i wasnt always this cracked
i used to be normal well as normal as any girl under the influence of teenage hormones
but after the killings began i started to feel i dont know
loose around the edges or something
i was coming undone like those jeans i made in home ec
falling to pieces like patsy cline
shredded like moo shu pork
needy cringes as she briefly hallucinates abstract shapes in the darkness
faces drained of life half eaten
grimaces of terror
suddenly soft music is piped into the hole ostensibly to calm the patients in solitary
needy shudders and recoils at the sound of it
its a cheesy rock ballad that well soon hear again
through the trees i will find you
heal the ruins left inside you
and the stars will remind you well meet again
god i hate this fucking song
needy plugs her ears as if it physically hurts her to listen to the song
she curls up in the corner and steels herself for solitary confinement
devils kettle is a quiet farming community surrounded by dense woods and mirrored lakes
its the kind of town that has one high school one pizza joint and one stoplight
on an overgrown rural route we see a rustic sign that reads welcome to devils kettle pop
come see whats cookin
this is where it all went down
devils kettle sounds twisted i know but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall
we see the titular falls surprisingly powerful gushing over a rock face
well technically its two waterfalls
one of them is normal it empties into a river basin
but the other one goes into a hole
and it doesnt come out
the scientist guys cant explain it
theyve dropped all kinds of things down there bouncy balls red dye radioactive slime but nothing ever surfaces
maybe its another dimension
or you know just really deep
the sprawling ranch house is dark from the outside except for a single first floor window jennifers still illuminated
theres a chicken coop and a wire livestock pen in the backyard
were definitely in deep north country
ive probably spent years of my life in this house
hundreds of sleepovers thousands of aimless homework sessions a million phone calls
ive climbed through jennifers window so many times
but tonight only one of us is going to come out
jennifer check lies on her bed fidgeting as she watches tv
shes a girl of with long matted hair and a thin frail body
her features are gorgeous but she looks sick and haggard
she picks at her skin with yellowed nosferatu like fingernails and chews idly on a limp lock of hair
jennifer wears a tight t shirt that says kettle high flags and underwear
an s horror movie flickers on the tv
jennifer half watches distracted
jennifer didnt always look this rough
actually she was the prettiest girl in devils kettle when she wasnt so
some recent photos on a corkboard reveal that jennifer was indeed beautiful and curvy
she hadnt fed in weeks
jennifer rolls over and glances at the window briefly
we see the outside of the house again
its dark and silent but for the nearly inaudible snapping of twigs
jennifer turns her attention back to the tv
suddenly we see needys face pop up against the window white and startling
before jennifer notices the face disappears
outside the house the bushes rustle
needy is crouched below the window
we hear the pulsing of her heart as if via ultrasound
its a wet rhythmic sound sploish sploish sploish
inside jennifer stretches and shuts off the tv
she turns out the light
a beat of silence
then the sound of cracking near the window
needy plunges through the window screaming and brandishing a hammer
she takes a swing at jennifers head but misses and buries it in the wall specifically in jennifers fall out boy poster
needy throws herself on top of jennifer
she straddles jennifer and grips her throat throttling her
youll throw me a bone huh
you killed chip
you goddamned monster
jennifer struggles to fight off needy in the darkness
her clawlike fingernails rake needys back and arms
needy pulls a box cutter out of her waistband and flicks it open like a switchblade
do you buy all your murder weapons at home depot
god youre butch
know what this is for
she takes a swipe at jennifers crotch
jennifer instinctively clutches herself and rears up in defense
we see jennifers mouth come down on needys neck
needy shrieks as if bitten but continues to strangle jennifer straddling her and bearing down
jennifers t shirt slides up to her armpits exposing her breasts
for a moment her eyes meet needys and she grins
its as if she has control over needy for a split second sexual control
needy recoils and slashes jennifers body left and right with the box cutter marking a gory oozing x on her torso
jennifer gasps staring at her wounds in shock and disbelief
she looks back up at needy
a beat of silence
suddenly the girls bodies levitate rapidly toward the ceiling
they wrestle in a bloody screaming airborne heap their figures entwined
their bodies fall collapsing back onto the bed with a thud
needy raises the box cutter and plunges it into jennifers heart
blood geysers from the wound
suddenly the room is flooded with bright light revealing a needy straddling jennifers mutliated body
jennifers breathing is a raspy death rattle
check a middle aged woman in bad sleepwear and a worse perm rushes into the bedroom
what is it baby
oh my god
oh my god
she pulls needy off her daughter
jennifer rolls over gasping and bleeding
needy drops the boxcutter
it lands on jennifers copy of flag team quarterly splashing the model with fresh gore
is she dead mrs
did i get her
check cradles her maimed daughter on the floor like a white trash pieta
jennifer takes one last breath vomits blood and dies
three police cars squeal up to the curb with sirens and lights engaged
officer roman duda a muscular young cop jogs authoritatively toward the house
he shakes his head dumbfounded
christ needy what have you done
needy innocent looking in pigtails is hustled into the back of the squad car
her clothes and face are smeared with blood
officer duda starts the ignition
his partner a hard faced female cop slides into the front seat
her cap is pushed back to accommodate a huge round pouf of shellacked mall bangs
hows the force treating you
i like that jaunty cap
blue like your balls
how could you do this needy
you killed jen jennifer i mean the victim
are you on something
everythings going to be okay now
shut your mouth back there
didnt you used to baby sit me in like
when my mom worked the overnight at hormel
the female cop fidgets uncomfortably
i really like your hair gracie
how many cans of salon selectives did it take to erect that monument
the cop reaches into the backseat and slaps needy who hiccups with laughter
watch it puffy combs
thats police brutality
youre one to talk about brutality ms
youre looking at attempted murder
ugh dont say attempted
that sounds so jv
teeny weeny just like officer duda up there
and trust me id know
roman swallows nervously eyes on the road
officer warzak glances at him
lets get our facts straight i successfully committed a hard core fully premeditated murder back there
i fucking destroyed that brat ok
i needy lesnicki put a stop payment on jennifer check
she slumps down in the backseat
why am i even in these cuffs
i just saved every guy in this town from becoming satan chow
im a hero
this is going to be a circus
at least weve already got a confession
confessions are for pussies
youve got a declaration grace
she giggles maniacally
roman turns on the radio violating protocol
its a soaring rock anthem the same song we heard being piped into solitary confinement
both cops brighten when they hear the song
roman cranks the volume
god i love this song
and theyve done so much for this town
theyre way more than a band really
wait this is my favorite part
roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting corny song in unison through the trees i will find you
heal the ruins left inside you
and the stars will remind you that you are home
needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon
so i killed her
it wont undo anything
three pulses three lives all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust
its hard to believe that just two months ago me jennifer and my boyfriend chip were completely normal people
we were our yearbook pictures
nothing more nothing less
we see a brief montage of black and white yearbook stills jennifer executing the splits on a football field her smile bright
needy inspecting a school newspaper layout pen in hand glasses on her nose
and finally chip dove playing a strap on snare drum at a school pep rally his head bent in concentration
the photo fades into the pep rally itself
chip is animated drumming in full color
chip drums on the sidelines of the devils kettle high basketball court
the stands are packed with bored students for a pep rally
chip is clean cut and an awful drummer
chip couldnt drum for shit
he only knew land of a thousand dances and the solo from wipeout
lucky for him the pep band gig wasnt too demanding
sure enough the band is playing land of a thousand dances
nearby the flag team claps with gloved hands picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt
jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform breathtakingly beautiful
she hoists her flag aloft twirling it
time freezes as the flag unfurls
if you can believe it thats jennifer
yeah the same girl i iced with the box cutter
only back then we were tight
people found it hard to believe that a babe like jennifer would associate with a dork like me
but wed been the wonder twins since we were practically preverbal
sandbox love never dies
jennifer finishes her maneuver and waves to the stands
needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers small and owlish with glasses and lank hair
chastity a similarly geeky looking girl standing next to needy rolls her eyes at this display of affection
youre totally lesbigay
shes my best friend
the geeky girl mockingly imitates needys excited wave
you stare at her like you want to dry hump her
needy ignores her
like hump her through pants
are you jealous
that rich bitch
shes not rich
needy digs through her locker carefully selecting textbooks to take home
jennifer skips up to her smiling
whats up vagisil
you and me are going out tonight
she checks herself out in needys locker mirror
soft shoulder are playing at the carousel
and its all ages for once which means i wont have to play hello titty with the door guy
whats soft shoulder
theyre this indie band from the city
i saw their myspace and the singer is extra salty
and there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you
come on needy its the weekend
thursday counts as the weekend in college
and were going to be in college twenty three months from now
university of northern minnesota duluth woo
needy continues loading her backpack
please please youre a social disease
i have to study
with an outstretched finger she draws a dramatic x in the air over needy and boos loudly
cross out needy
needy blushes shrinking self consciously
she obviously hates to displease jennifer
what time is the show
ill pick you up at
my mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store
he seems nice
yeah mom says hes got a huge
so huge he gave her a recurring bladder infection
wear something cool okay
needy is standing in a small dingy bathroom trying on different configurations of clothing
wear something cool meant something very specific in jennifer speak
it meant i couldnt look like a nerd but i couldnt upstage her either
i could expose my stomach but never cleavage
tits were her trademark
needy wiggles her jeans a bit lower exposing her childishly round tummy
she walks out of the bathroom into her bedroom a frilly pink hell complete with canopy bed
chip dove is sitting on the bed looking lost in all that pink
he raises an eyebrow at needys abdomen
those jeans are hella low
i can almost see your front butt
chip its a rock show
this is my rock look
i can see like your womb
needy sighs and hoists up her pants
why are you blowing me off for some dumb concert anyway
we were supposed to have movie night
i even rented orca
its like jaws except with a harmless whale
jennifer needs me
she really wants to go see this band
its extremely important to her
ive never even heard of soft shoulder
which one is jennifer stalking
the lead singer of course
girls like her dont go out with drummers
thanks a lot
i mean shed probably make an exception for a drummer who was also the lead singer
like phil collins
whos phil collins
hes seminal but whatever
anyway this singer guy is like so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her
but jennifer says hes extra salty so
you guys ever going to stop using that secret language
salty means beautiful
then you must be soy sauce babe
needy and chip start making out
chip unbuckles his belt eagerly even though theyve barely begun
how do you know
a beat of silence
then we hear the door swing open
jennifers voice floats up from downstairs
needy quit tampooning yourself and get down here
thats fucking weird
straightening her id better hurry
you always do what jennifer tells you to do
needy pulls her necklace out from beneath her shirt and flashes a heart shaped b
charm at chip
shes my best friend chip
this necklace is no joke
chip sighs resigned
they head downstairs
jennifer is waiting in the front hallway
shes heavily made up and dressed in a predictably sexy outfit
she dangles a set of car keys in front of needy and chip
guess whos got the whip til
a chrysler sebring and its all mine
youre lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style
she does a sexy little dance in the doorway then notices oh hi chip
do you like puppies
she grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him giggling
needy watches jealously and maneuvers her way i think you forgot like two buttons
i think she remembered two buttons
jennifer sniffs the air
it smells like thai food in here
have you guys been fucking
she shoves jennifer and they begin wrestling playfully
chip slumps against the wall staring awestruck at jennifers cleavage
okay lets go to the club
the three of them shuffle onto the porch
needy locks the door
the carousel is not a club
eat my ass chip
youre just jello cause youre not invited
im not jello
that place is gross
everyone there has a mustache
youre totally jello
youre lime green jello and you cant even admit it
the girls scamper toward the car
calling after them stop kidnapping my girlfriend
the carousel is a run down tavern at the edge of town the kind with nascar posters wobbly chairs and strands of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling
its a busy night and the bar is teeming with locals
a bartender sells a case of beer to a customer and passes it over the bar
chip was right
the carousel is definitely not a club
clubs are for attractive people in populous urban areas
clubs have djs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and girls
all we have is a broken jukebox a few domestic taps and the sticker toilet
we see a lone nasty looking toilet covered in band needy and jennifer enter the bar
every guy in the joint stares at jennifer who snaps her minor wristband distastefully
god i cant wait until im old enough to get wasted
have you ever had peach schnapps
i dont think so
peach schnapps are excellent
they even taste good when they come out of your nose mid puke
a teenage guy craig passes by and waves
you look nice
without enthusiasm what up craig
she elbows needy and makes a gagging gesture
he thinks hes cute enough for me
no wonder hes in retard math
jennifer pulls out a pack of camel wides and lights one awkwardly
needy notices ahmet from india a foreign exchange student standing by himself away from the crowd
hey its ahmet from india
the foreign exchange guy
hes all by himself
i cant believe we traded a cute hockey player for that
he seems okay
hes got that cool elephant statue in his locker
do you think hes circumcised
i always wanted to try sea cucumber
roman duda saunters up to jennifer swigging a bottle of beer
he snatches the pack of cigarettes away from her
youre smoking dicks now jen
i like the wides
she sticks the fat cigarette between her lips and inhales pointedly
i just bet you do
i should arrest you for possession under the legal age
arrest me pfft
youre not even out of the academy yet roman
two more months and im on the force for real
then ill be able to cuff you whenever the hell i want
he grips her wrist and twists it behind her back
how will i wait that long
she paws romans crotch discreetly
not here babe
i gotta keep my nose clean
look theres the band
a group of skinny indie rock boys are setting up their equipment on a pathetically tiny stage its more like a dais
the lead singer has intense spooky eyes nearly obscured by a shock of hair
the locals mostly good ol boys eye the band suspiciously
you can tell theyre from the city
yeah cause they look like a bunch of faygos
you would think that
youre such a small time gomer
i wish we had more guys like that in devils kettle
all stylish and shit
needy nods dumbly
she stares at the band awestruck
they look so so cool
she gazes at the stage hearing only the whistling rush of arctic air
in slow motion the guitarist unsheathes his fender jaguar from its gig bag
he notices her staring and runs the tip of his tongue over his lips
needy swallows hard
hey i think they need two groupies
itll be like almost famous
ill be penny lane and you can be the other girl
she grabs needys hand and enthusiastically tries to drag her toward the stage
dont be j
theyre just boys
we have all the power dont you know that
she plants her hands on needys chest
these things are like smart bombs
point em in the right direction and shit gets real
needy shrugs free of jennifers grasp and follows her reluctantly across the room
the lead singer of soft shoulder nikolai wolf is already striding forward to meet them at the lip of the stage
his gait is as smooth as his shock of dyed black hair
um we just really wanted to meet you or something
im jennifer check and this is my friend
im nikolai wolf and this is my band
he reaches down and pumps jennifers outstretched hand
soft shoulder right
ive heard you guys are super super good at playing your instruments
i hope we can live up to such
hey if you dont mind me asking why did you want to play all the way out here in devils kettle
you live in the city right
but i think its so important to connect with our fans in rural areas
plus the audiences in small towns really appreciate us
can i show you my appreciation right now
needy looks at the floor embarrassed
jennifers voice scales up nervously
like ill buy you a drink
i mean ill see if i can get you a drink
they make this great tribute shooter
its red white and blue but you have to drink it fast or it gets all brownish
jennifer hurries off toward the bar
needy moves self consciously into a nearby corner not wanting to continue the conversation with nikolai alone
a local plugs a loretta lynn tune into the jukebox with a challenging stare at the band
a drunk couple begins two stepping in front of the stage
nikolai walks up to the guitar player dirk and pulls him aside
needy pricks up her ears and listens
dirk what about her
gesturing to needy who training bra jones
needy looks offended
no the hot one
the one who just walked away
shes it man
shes exactly what were looking for
youre sure shes
shes a kid
were in gods country man
everyone out heres a fundie bible banger
of course shes a virgin
dirk we didnt haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing
you know i know im not just the bassist
im a person who happens to play the bass guitar
and i would like some respect
nikolai is already ignoring him
needy alarmed emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where jennifer is arguing with a jealous looking roman
he shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar
jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious patriotic themed drink
she laughs when she sees needys concerned expression
are you scared of rock stars too
those guys are rank jen
just forget about it
i think the singer wants me
only because he thinks youre a virgin
i heard them talking
im not even a backdoor virgin anymore thanks to roman
by the way that hurts
i couldnt even go to flags the next day
i had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas
oh my god
well if nikolai wants innocent i can do innocent
ill be little miss fucking sunshine
hes way too old for you
dont cock block me needy
piercing feedback signals the beginning of the set
nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly
good evening devils lake
someone in the back shouts devils kettle
anyway were soft shoulder
and we just want to make you happy
he winks at jennifer
the band launch into the same intense soaring song we heard in the cop car and the hole
jennifers eyes never leave nikolais
shes hypnotized clinging to needys arm
even the locals look charmed
suddenly a lick of flame appears on the wood paneling next to the stage
needy is the first to notice
as she watches in horror the fire is reflected in her glasses
the flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably
people scream and scatter
someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire
nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading
he and chas exchange glances
the bass player pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage and the drummer abandons his kit
nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage
is he smiling
everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once causing a stampede
a womans clothes and hair catch fire and she falls to her knees
we see a beam fall from the roof nearly killing ahmet from india
jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state
to jennifer i know where to go
needy grabs jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny bathroom
choking on smoke they climb onto the sticker toilet which now sports a giant soft shoulder sticker on the tank and boost each other out the bathroom window
hundreds are still trapped inside screaming
jennifer collapses in needys arms coughing
needy hugs her fiercely almost romantically
she cups jennifers flushed face and looks into her eyes
its so hot needy
i think im on fire
oh god im burning
youre okay i promise
you got burned worse when you wore that tin foil bikini to the beach
suddenly a hand clamps onto jennifers shoulder
both girls jump
its nikolai his forehead creased with false concern
are you girls all right
needy is less than thrilled to see him
maybe you should try to find your band
they were the first ones out the door
ran for the van like a bunch of marys
frankly im ashamed of them
needy narrows her eyes suspiciously
muffled screams rise up from the flame engulfed building
jennifer covers her ears and cowers sweat rolling down her face
god it feels like hell out here
come and hang with us in the van for a while just until they hose this place down
she slumps against nikolais chest
youre in shock
here drink this
youll feel better
he smoothly retrieves a plastic bottle of peach schnapps from his coat and holds it to jennifers lips
she swigs it cooperatively dribbling down her chin
needy blinks in disbelief at the coincidence
arent you a little freaked out about this
what about all your stuff
its probably melting and when you get to the next stop youll have to do like a crappy acoustic set
nobody likes that
well be able to afford new gear soon enough
i have a feeling were gonna blow up
i want to see your van
cmon needy lets go to the van
why should we
we have the malibu
lets just get out of here
we can go to el ojo and get northwoods nachos with extra badger sauce
needy stop it
just stop it
she defiantly follows nikolai toward the white van which is parked a suspiciously safe distance from the bar
needy staggers after them slowly watching
behind needy the bar explodes
needy doesnt even look back as she watches jennifer get into the van
ash drifts into her hair like snowflakes
nikolai takes off his shirt as he enters the van revealing his slick muscled white torso
i watched her get into that van and i knew something awful was going to happen
but for some reason i felt drawn toward them
he was pale and twisted and evil like this petrified tree i saw when i was a kid
we see little needy about five years old staring up at a petrified tree in the darkness horrified yet compelled
the tree seems to stoop forward cracking
needys face is fixed in the same haunted expression
nikolai turns to look at her his teeth bared in a vicious smile
needy turns and sprints off in the opposite direction away from the van and the fire
needy stumbles into her bedroom overwhelmed
her clothes are smoke damaged and her cheeks are sooty
she grabs her cheap taped up cell phone and dials chips number shakily
chips bedroom is pitch black until a cheap cell phone lights up under the covers illuminating his sleeping form clad only in jockey shorts
thank god youre there
i hoped you were sleeping with your phone
she ran off with that rock band
and the carousel burned down
chip sits bolt upright like burned down
to the ground
is everyone okay
i think theyre mostly dead
youre okay right
we went out the bathroom window
everyone else was trying to use the door
it was like a stampede
the people who fainted got run over and you could hear their bones breaking
there was all this screaming and popping like a million black cats all going off at once
and the smell
this is real right
this isnt just like some crazy dream like last time
anyway it took me like an hour to walk home
but jennifers still with those creeps
they had one of those white molester vans with no windows
the back was all blacked out
who cares about jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts
people just burned to death
in our town
the doorbell chimes
oh cheese and fries
im alone chip
im freaked out
wheres your mom
listen ill call you in a minute
needy hangs up the phone and rushes downstairs
as she passes through the shadowy kitchen appliances hum all around her
the silence is menacing
needy opens the door
she slams the door turns around and screams
jennifer is standing in the dark hallway looking ghostly pale and smiling
her clothes are tattered and stained her entire front is soaked in blood
her makeup is smeared and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a zombies
she looks horrifying especially with that ghastly clownish grin
jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood tinged teeth
then a dripping sound
needy looks down and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum
jennifer continues to smile staring directly at needy
jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee scream wailing at the top of her lungs
she vomits a torrent of evil looking black bile all over herself and needy and staggers wildly down the hallway
the bloody black bile hits the wall splashing a framed school portrait of needy
needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall
the bile has hundred of tiny spines sticking out of it like little porcupine needles and it appears to move by itself oozing across the linoleum creeping into the corners
its truly revolting
needy grabs jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth
jennifer falls to her knees her screams turning to jagged insane laughter
needy tries to run but jennifer grabs her and throws her against the wall with superhuman force pinning her
jennifer slowly tantalizingly brushes her face against needys hair her earlobe
needy doesnt move a muscle
jennifers hand slides up needys ribcage
she presses her lips against needys carotid artery
we hear needys blood pumping swishing
are you scared
jennifer parts her lips
then suddenly she stops and pulls away pushing needy to the floor
jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street
needy is motionless for a moment then stumbles toward the doorway
screaming after her jennifer
but shes long gone
moments before the first morning bell
needy is sitting at her desk in english class still visibly bruised from her scuffle with jennifer the night before
she looks like she hasnt slept a wink
the mood is quiet and somber kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups
i heard needy and jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete
look shes not even moving
its called post traumatic stress disorder
suddenly a figure steps in front of needy
its jennifer looking absolutely gorgeous and remarkably unscathed
she smiles brightly at needy as if nothing happened the night before
you youre all right
why wouldnt i be
at my house
you were hurt
you had two black eyes and blood everywhere and
needy youre delusional
i got a little banged up when you made me go out that window but im fine
we had to go out that window
the bar was like engulfed in flames
you do have a tendency to overreact
remember at girl scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster
a lot of people died jennifer
they burned to death or they choked or they just got trampled
more than half of the people there didnt make it out
its like all over the news
kids are dead
parents are dead
anyone we know
we know everyone
sucks to be them i guess
she giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse
i dont get it
whats wrong with you
jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together
whats wrong with you
i mean besides the obvious surface flaws
needy rubs her eyes stunned
to herself theres no way i dreamed it
she looks down at her hands
theres dried blood under her fingernails
her blood was still under my nails
see id been up all night scrubbing the carnage off the linoleum
we see needy on her hands and knees in the eerie blue light of dawn sobbing as she diligently scrubs blood and bile off the floor with a dirty sponge
the black spiny vomit repulses her and she gags
she reaches for a swiffer wetjet mop and pulls the trigger
no solution comes out
she curses hysterical and sleep deprived
swiff darn it
she collapses in tears on the floor
softly to herself shoot
dont talk to yourself
its one of your more freakish needy behaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords
needy raises her hands desperately to jennifer spreading her fingers to display her filthy fingernails
eww you need a mani bad
youd better find a chinese chick to buff your situation
wroblewski a middle aged teacher enters the room
he has a gnarly looking robotic hand and moves awkwardly
here comes handi snack
wroblewski clears his throat
his voice quavers
im sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news
its a dark day for devils kettle a day we can never ever forget
a single stifled sob rises from the class
needy glances around the room and sees students fighting back tears
a huge jock weeps openly tears spattering his swimsuit model decorated notebook
jennifer smirks barely able to contain her laughter
the administration here has decided that today will be a unstructured day of support and remembrance
weve lost nine precious students including ahmet from india several parents and a teacher ms
he fights back tears
parrish ate shit
needy shushes her appalled
this tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure
more than ever we need to band together and draw strength from each other
wroblewski painstakingly retrieves a tissue from his pocket with his robotic hand and dabs at his face
his voice cracking we can rise up
we can overcome death
needy eyes jennifer warily
the jock collapses in sobs
a tiny acne scarred geek leans over and folds the jock into an unlikely hug
oh look theyre united in grief
the automated bell rings
needy slings on her backpack and hurries over to chips locker
hes packing up a pair of drum mallets
no band practice today
no anything today
its surreal right
i mean when just one guy dies in devils kettle its like time stops
and now so many people are dead nobody knows when its okay to start again
i feel guilty just breathing
chip i need to tell you something kind of weird
its about jennifer
you know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door
that was jennifer
but she didnt talk
she just stood there smiling at me but a bad kind of smile
she looked like shed been beat up or shot or something
she was all bloody
and then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together
she shudders at the memory yuck
like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out
yeah like almost that bad
chip and needy ponder the grotesque image in silence
it was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke
it was something evil
you might want to talk to the school shrink needy
im not saying that to be a dillhole
im actually kinda concerned
chip im a national merit scholar
i dont tell whoppers and im not crazy
i didnt say you were crazy
its just that everyones a little messed up about this
its okay to feel
yeah you know
as they prepare to leave colin gray approaches needy
hes a cute punk goth guy wearing black nail polish a lip ring and full wardrobe by hot topic
chip blatantly scoots closer to needy eyeing colin suspiciously
i heard you were there last night
in the fiery trenches
well im glad you made it out
colin walks away
chip looks jealous
how are you friends with colin gray
i thought colin gray only talked to the dead girls
we see a group of goth girls splayed against their lockers in full regalia
one wears an accordion for no reason
i just am
we have composition together
hes a really good writer
you know hes so dark and emotional and all
i can relate
im also like that even if im not all obvious about it like a poseur
walk me home
you know it
jonas kozelle the jock we saw sobbing earlier is standing at the deserted football field
its a gray overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees
the football is set back a good a distance from the school and jonas is all alone
in the distance a tiny figure slowly approaches it starts a dot on the horizon
as it draws closer we see its jennifer
her bright lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable
jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder indifferent
a few seconds later he glances again
strangely jennifer isnt there
jennifer suddenly appears on jonass left side startling him
im crazy sorry about your profound loss
you are crying about craig right
he was my best friend
jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically
i was close to him too
you know i was there last night in that horrible place
i saw craig a few minutes before the fire broke out
you you did
i was probably the last person to talk to him
what did he say
well we got to talking about you actually
and do you know what he said
he said you were like a brother to him
not a bro
an actual brother
jonass lip trembles as he unsuccessfully fights back tears
jennifer cuddles closer to him
choking up i just cant believe hes gone
i know i know
hey you know what else craig said
its too intense
please jen youve gotta tell me
well he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin couple
isnt that so weird
he said bangin
jennifer reaches for jonass hand and slides it slowly up her shirt placing it on her left breast
feel my heart jonas
i think its broken
choking up mine too
come with me
just for a while
well help each other get through this nightmare
its what craig would have wanted
jonas nods dumbly brainwashed
jennifer leads him away from the field toward the woods bordering the school campus
they vanish into the woods
in the distance we see the falls rushing into the lake
needy and chip are walking home from school still deep in discussion
the whole night must be a total blur right
thats the thing its not a blur at all
i remember everything in like ultra high def detail
the band the fire everything
especially what happened after
after is the part i dont really get to be honest
please i need someone to believe me
jennifer was she was destroyed
she was dying in my hallway chip
i used my cpr training to check her pulse
and i felt her dying on the inside i mean
ive known her so long that its like sometimes i can feel what she feels
were like e
and elliot ness
i believe you
chip takes needys hand and squeezes it
jennifer and jonas are in the woods
jennifer efficiently whips off her top and bra and begins kissing jonas hungrily
as jonas touches her he recoils
you feel so warm
why are you so warm
firmly covering his shutties
she pulls off jonas shirt and digs her nails into his arms kissing him with renewed ferocity
the woods are dead silent
a few squirrels approach the clearing and jonas watches them warily with one open eye as jennifer kisses him
then a deer wanders into the clearing
then a fox
the animals pause in their tracks and watch motionless
its an eerie unnatural tableau
animals continue to gather
jennifer is annoyed
he gestures to the animals who are watching still as statues
a few crows alight on a nearby tree
jennifer unzips jonass jeans and smiles reaching down and working him with her hand
jonas moans still eyeing the animals
do you miss craig
youre going to see your buddy again
you mean like in heaven someday
she smiles and shakes her head
jonas jerks back creeped out
he tries to pull away from jennifer but shes too strong
she pins him to the tree
we see her jaw begin to unhinge like some horrible snake
her eyes cloud over with blood
a horrible scream of agony rises from the woods
wroblewski is exiting the school briefcase in hand
he stops in his tracks when he hears the scream
he shakes his head sadly
to himself god theyre feeling so much pain
another scream this time weaker
let it all out kids
he heads for his ford festiva then pauses as if thinking better of it
something isnt right
he puts his keys back in his pocket and walks toward the woods to investigate
needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen
needys albino ferret chases a ball across the cracked floor
needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite
fried bologna is the bomb
to ferret you want some greedo
she tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song through the trees by soft shoulder
suddenly she pauses a look of unease and even fear crossing her face
she stops and braces herself against the counter her knees shaking
something isnt right
she drops the sandwich
greedo goes straight for it
as needy sinks to her knees she stares straight ahead at the refrigerator
a photo magnet of jennifer leers back at her
she closes her eyes
a brief near subliminal flash of the carnage in the woods
the song ends snapping needy out of her reverie
that was soft shoulder the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in devils kettle last night
eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno risking their own lives in the process
thats rock n roll with a conscience ladies and gentlemen
had a lot of requests for that one
wroblewski ventures into the woods heading toward the clearing
at first we can only hear mysterious sounds scratching and smacking
birds and animals are closely gathered in a circle
wroblewski clutches his arm and gags realizing the animals are feeding on a huge carcass
a badger looks up its snout soaked in blood
wroblewski begins to scream
the animals scatter
a glimpse of the corpse its jonas of course
his entire torso has been torn open exposing his ribs and guts
blood and viscera everywhere intestines strewn about the forest floor like party streamers
wroblewski falls to his knees hollering
needy is seated at the kitchen table
she accidentally drops the remains of her sandwich on the floor where the ferret quickly pillages it
needys mom antonia toni lesnicki has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas
shes pale and sweaty as if shes been spooked
you said it
oh hi mom
i didnt know you were awake
i just had one of my night terrors
its four o clock so technically you had a day terror
im all mixed up since i started working swing again
what did you dream about
i dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit
just like jesus
she crosses herself piously
they were trying to get to you too but i wouldnt let em
im a hard assed ford tough mama bear
yes you are
its like dont yall touch my daughter
ill piss on you like calvin
you know i can take care of myself mom
thats what you think
one of these days youre gonna be crying out for me and i might not be there
did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning
i just did my scratch tickets snorted a few lunesta and went straight to bed
is something going on
dont nothing happen in devils kettle
she watches the ferret skitter across the kitchen floor
anita that ferret stinks
he needs to be washed from craw to cornhole
toni shakes her head and heads upstairs
a hysterical scream pierces the twilight
the sun has begun to set
an ambulance and four police cars have pulled up near the woods which are cordoned off with yellow police tape
near the woods jonass parents are crying
his mother screams and begins beating the ground with her fists
a stretcher is being loaded into the ambulance
officer warzak exits one of the police cruisers
her signature giant poofy bangs are in full effect
she rushes to comfort jonass bereaved mother
we will get the man that did this to your son
you hear me
well get that sick m
ill get him myself
you hear me you bastard
ill cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door
like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got
thatll be your balls
the sound of jonass parents screaming carries across the lake
the water is eerily calm
suddenly a head breaks the surface of the lake
its jennifer gliding through the water
she looks calm and serene
the screaming continues across the lake
the sirens shouting and chaos contrast sharply with this peaceful scene
jennifer paddles to the shore and hoists herself onto the pier naked and dripping wet
she runs her tongue over her teeth briefly and nonchalantly picks something out from between her two front teeth like shes just finished a delicious rib dinner
jennifer wrings out her sopping hair and reaches for her clothes which are neatly folded on the pier
once shes dressed she walks off into the woods as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened
needy is sitting at her lamp lit desk reading an old e
horror comic and eating a banana
the phone rings
needy picks it up
jennifers hair is still wet from the lake but shes changed into shorts and a tank top
music blasts from her stereo
she admires herself in the mirror popping her ass
i feel sooo scrumptious
she picks up a soft shoulder button and pokes her arm hard with the pin without flinching
blood spurts from the wound
good for you
you know like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and your whole body feels like its on vibrate
its that good
jennifer gazes at her arm transfixed
she wipes the blood away the wound has magically disappeared
see im still kind of depressed about you know the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town
move on dot org needy
lifes too short to mope over some white trash pig roast
she flicks a zippo lighter and touches the flame to her tongue first tentatively then confidently
thats really nice
i tell it like it is
besides you should be happy for me
im having the best day since like jesus invented the calendar
jesus didnt invent the calendar
jennifer giggles maniacally and sighs with happiness
needys call waiting beeps
thats my other line
so blow it off
she casually lights her hair on fire
the flames leap up then die down leaving her entirely untouched
itll just be a second
im crossing you out
she draws a mini x in the air
needy clicks over
we get a nice trifold pie chart illustrating the intersecting calls
chip is panicked and sweaty in his living room
in the background chips little sister camille bangs on a piano
red police lights flash outside the picture window
i need to see you right now
i can barely hear you
camille is playing piano
knock it off camille
you knock it off
can you meet me at mccullum in ten
you knock it off chip
youre penis cheese
back on jennifer jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm
blood drips onto the rug
she smiles in awe of herself
needy clicks back over
i have to go
what could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers
i have to meet chip at mccullum park
chip is looking cute to me lately
so tell me is he packing some serious pubic inches
whats the story down there
i gotta go
needy hangs up the phone abruptly and grabs one of her many cardigan sweaters heading for the door
the park is dark and tree lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of devils kettle
the abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of couples making out
needy runs past them skittishly
as she ascends a grassy hill chip is revealed silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights
needy squints at the lights sees chips house in the distance
why are the cops at your house
theyre at jonas kozelles house
he got murdered
like he was shot by gangbangers
do you see anyone rollin on dubs around here
someone ripped jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school
ate parts of him
they found teethmarks on him on the body
his voice cracks
we see a brief terrifying flash of jonass mutilated body and pain stricken face
needy doesnt want to believe it
some animals mustve got to him
who would do that
i dont know
it just happened after school
no ones supposed to know yet but my dad went over there and talked to the cops
jonass mom is catatonic
shes just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue
this cant be a coincidence
what do you mean needy
a fiery death trap last night and now a cannibal eats our starting tight end
dont get spooky on me babe
most small towns only have something gruesome happen like once every decade maybe
devils kettle gets two nightmares in hours
its not right
what do you think its like supernatural
i dont know
im extremely intelligent but i obviously dont know everything
well the bad lucks gotta be over now right
it cant get any worse right
obviously it cant
i mean you agree right
there wont be another victim
its very cold out here
want my sweater
pink is cool
rap guys wear pink
shes shaking now too
chip leans forward and kisses her
she closes her eyes
in the chaste space between chip and needys bodies the volleyball pit couple fuck like rabbits
the familiar soft shoulder ballad plays as we see a dreamy montage of headlines
the headline of the devils kettle sun post simply reads the headline of the minneapolis star tribune reads butchered devils kettle youth brutally murdered in wake of devastating fire
a smaller headline on the front page of the new york times reads minnesota town rocked by grisly murder blaze
we were famous
we were saints
our towns only bar had burned to the ground and our star quarterback was somebodys quarter pounder
the whole country got a huge tragedy boner for devils kettle
and the press god they couldnt get enough of our little world of shit
we see devils kettle citizens holding a tearful candlelight vigil by the former carousel site
they softly sing along with the soft shoulder song
through the trees i will find you
we see weeping students shoving flowers through the slats of jonas abandoned locker
the hallway floor is covered with teddy bears and bouquets
we see the passing of time as the bouquets wilt and the blooms droop
the pile of discarded scratch off tickets next to needys mothers bed grows steadily as the days go by
another star tribune headline
this one reads two weeks later cannibal killer still at large
a smaller subhead reads arts local band soft shoulder sign to major
the days marched on as usual but most of us were too numb to enjoy ourselves
most of us
we see jennifer cheerfully skipping down the school hallway in a sleazy technicolor outfit
the rest of the kids look grey ashen and depressed but jennifer pops like a roman candle
still we were healing
like chip we figured things could only get better
we had faith
we see clusters of cautiously optimistic kids in the school courtyard
they smile then laugh as if theyre re learning how to be happy
we were fucking idiots
its late september
leaves are beginning to drift off trees
the surrounding woods are still blocked off with yellow police tape
wroblewski stands solemnly in front of the class his mechanical hand tensing and releasing nervously
needy and the rest of the class fidget
before the period ends i have an announcement
as you know this is the one month anniversary of the carousel fire and also the murder of jonas kozelle
we see jennifer
she looks haggard thin and cranky
are you okay
i feel like boo boo
my skin is breaking out
my hair is dull and lifeless
god its like im one of the normal girls
needy smooths her own hair self consciously
are you pms ing or something
pms isnt real needy
it was invented by the boy run media to make us seem crazy
wroblewski clears his throat annoyed by their talking
as i was saying needy and jennifer i finally have some good news to share with all of you
the members of the rock group soft shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community
a ripple of excitement in the room
a girl seated in the front row is wearing a soft shoulder t shirt
as you know their song through the trees has become our unofficial anthem of unity and healing
so theyve decided to release it as a benefit single
of the profits will go to local families who have been affected by loss
the class is happily abuzz except needy who looks appalled
what about the other
i mean thats just crass
she looks around for support finding none
it means scummy
am i the only one who actually does the vocab drills
chastity the girl in the soft shoulder t shirt turns to face needy angrily
soft shoulder are american heroes
no theyre not
i was there chastity
they didnt actually help anyone escape the fire
i dont even know how that rumor got started
its on their wikipedia page
oh thats crap
theyve milked our pain our loss to get a stupid record deal
no one would even know who they were if they hadnt been playing here that night
they used us
growling almost you take that back needy lesnicki
we need them now more then ever
the bell rings
students get up and gather their books for the next period
needy and jennifer slowly head toward their respective lockers
im already sick of that song
its poorly produced
could the bass be any lower in the mix
no offense but you look kind of drained
is everything all right
its just like wearing off or something
whats wearing off
are you on pot
no dick ridge
just forget i said anything
colin gray the punk goth boy we met earlier approaches jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom
needy drops behind them eavesdropping
to needy hi
to jennifer more hi jennifer
oh hey colin
listen can i copy your bio lab again
i never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus
actually i sort of wanted to ask you something
you want to know if ill go out with you
how did you know
just go ahead with the pitch
colin fidgets awkwardly
well weve been having a lot of fun in class you and i and i just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something
theres a midnight showing of rocky horror at the bijou next weekend
i dont like boxing movies
he turns to walk down the hallway dejected
jennifer watches him leave
colin turns around
why dont you just come by my place tonight
i just got aquamarine on dvd
its about this girl whos like half sushi
i guess she has sex through her blowhole or something
ill text you my address
colin walks away grinning triumphantly
that was random
im used to guys asking me out
colins a really nice guy
hes into maggot rock
he wears nail polish
chip appears behind needy and drapes his arm over her shoulder
needy jumps startled
needy puts her arm around chip protectively
i gotta go parlez french
slam you later
jennifer walks away
to needy talking to your good pal colin gray again
he was just asking jennifer out on a date
chip looks relieved
can i come over tonight
id like that
i went to super target and bought more condoms
not that that has anything to do with my coming over
i didnt assume that
well ill see you tonight
needy waves as chip walks away
colin gray drives down the street in a big old boat of a classic car
hes blasting punk music on an ipod thats been rigged to the ancient am radio
colin holds up his cell phone to re read the directions jennifer texted him
the street is extremely dark and silent occupied only by a new townhouse development
the identical units still appear to be under construction
there arent even any streetlights
the plastic sheeting over the windows flaps eerily in the breeze
colins brow furrows in confusion it doesnt even look like anyone lives here yet
he checks the phone display again
the text message reads trn lft on camerford and your there
first house on rt
xoxo jen sure enough the house number is
colin throws the car into park and walks up to the porch
he looks up and notices a glow coming from an upstairs window
colin presses the doorbell
nothing happens the house isnt wired for electricity yet
needy and chip are kissing on chips water bed
chip fumbles for one of those fragrance plug ins and plugs it into the wall
needy looks over
its jammin jasmine
my mom has holiday scents too if youre interested
no this is nice
colin enters the house tentatively
its dark vacant and very creepy
theres a very faint glow and soft music coming from upstairs
he stumbles over a stray x
there are piles of sawdust and building materials everywhere the house is definitely still under construction
colin looks confused
a mouse skitters over his sneakers
the music upstairs grows slightly louder in response
colin squares his shoulders and heads slowly up the creaking stairs
needy has eased off her top to reveal an endearingly plain white bra complete with center bow
chip also shirtless cops a feel
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a fluorescent orange condom
needy looks at the wrapper
its supposed to make it feel good for the girl
colin follows the music into an empty bedroom
the dark room is filled with blazing candles melting and pooling into bizarre shapes
a single blanket is spread out on the floor
behind him in the doorway jennifer appears her smiling face hellishly aglow
you made it
whats going on
this isnt really your house is it
this is our house just for you and me
we can play mommy and daddy
colin is totally dumbstruck
do you even know my last name
ive been sending you signals all year
couldnt you tell
you give me such a wettie
she starts kissing colin on the neck
we can see confusion and fear in his eyes
chip fumbles below his waist obviously struggling with the condom
needy leans forward for a closer look
its got little bumps on it
i can hardly wait
jennifer grips colins face in her hands and forcibly kisses him on the mouth
colin succumbs but stiffly
we hear a scratching noise
colin pulls away instinctively and sees mice and roaches emerging from the walls skittering over surfaces
jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles
i thought boys like you were into vermin
she unbuttons his jeans
they fall noisily to the floor theyre the baggy hot topic kind with chains and buckles galore
nice hardware ace
colin into jennifers eyes
theres something horrible about her face
like shes become almost corpselike
oh dont you dare pass out
i need you to be conscious
i gotta go
i need you frightened
colin tries to jerk away but jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket
a sickeningly moist snap
colin cries out in pain
i need you hopeless
she slams him to the ground and mounts him
her jaw unhinges opening her mouth to a horrifying inhuman degree
her teeth are razor sharp and grotesquely crowded like they belong to some horribly deformed dog
she descends on him feeding ravenously
we see their shadows against the wall jennifer lunging hungrily blood spraying up from colins jugular
we can hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood
chip is doggedly pumping away on top of needy his eyes closed in concentration
needys vacant eyes are suddenly brimming with tears
chip opens his eyes
am i hurting you
needy starts weeping
am i too big
tears roll down needys cheeks
she begins moaning then screaming at that top of her lungs
she hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows
then the infamous spiny black bile
pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness
skulls jesters demons death
its the worst acid trip imaginable
needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream
chip immediately rolls off needy concerned
he grabs her and tries to shake some sense into her
needy continues to shriek hysterically her voice growing ragged
we can still hear colin making inhuman sounds of pain
we can only see the carnage in shadow but its clearly unspeakable
needy clutches her throat hyperventilating
she stands up and struggles to get dressed
her breath rasps
chip is freaking out
is it something i did
do you need more foreplay
colins thrashing limbs finally go limp
jennifer is hunched over his remains like a jackal scooping blood into her mouth with cupped hands
we see his eyes flecked with blood pupils dilated
a white mouse crawls over his face
needy races toward the door with chip in pursuit
i have to go
feel like something
you feel what does that even mean
im worried about you
im so sorry chip
im so sorry
everything is just wrong
she bolts out the room leaving chip naked and alone
he pulls his knees up to his chest vulnerable
needy runs toward her moms car a beat up kia parked on the curb
she climbs into the car and starts the ignition trembling and crying
she pulls out onto the street and guns it
she swings a hard left
the streets are all almost identical lined by working class homes
she turns on the radio
the song is of course through the trees by soft shoulder
she pounds the dashboard hysterical
needy seizes the wheel drives recklessly down a dark tree lined street
then she sees something bright emerge from the shadows
her eyes widen
its jennifer creeping toward the curb like an animal
shes pale in the moonlight
the entire lower half of her face is covered in blood like a ghoulish beard of gore
she flashes a huge deranged toothy smile at needy
needy screams and swerves
the car fishtails out of control and slides into a ditch
needy slams her foot onto the accelerator trying to get out of the trench
she glances desperately out the side window
jennifer is gone
panting needy tries to accelerate again
suddenly jennifer appears from out of nowhere and slams her body against the windshield her long limbs splayed like an insects
the windshield shatters
jennifer grins at needy through the cracking glass
needy screams again puts the pedal to the floor and manages to rear up out of the ditch
jennifers body tumbles off the car as needy goes roaring down the street
that was of course soft shoulder
theyre going to be playing a benefit concert in devils kettle next month
talk about giving back to the community
generous guys i tell ya
needy throws the car into park and races up the front walk
she unlocks the door shaking and fumbling
she bursts into the darkened house
please be home
needy braces herself against the kitchen counter and bawls
she falls to her knees and curls up on the floor exhausted
her eyes drift shut
ive always been able to feel what she feels
just not like this
little needy and little jennifer are playing barbies in a sandbox
needy holds a brand new immaculate barbie doll
ill be perfect prom barbie and you be her
she tosses needy a naked brunette doll with its hair chopped off and an arm missing
why do i have to be ugly ashley
you can be ugly ashley or ken
she puts her hand down in the sand emphatically and suddenly howls in pain
whats wrong jennifer
jennifer lifts her hand
theres a tack stuck in her palm and its bleeding
trying to swear like a grown up damn
needy grabs jennifers hand pulls out the tack and wipes away the blood
its still bleeding
panicking she leans forward and instinctively puts her mouth to the wound
jennifer watches quietly
needy pulls away
we should get a band aid though
were sisters now you know
dont tell my mom about this
shell make me get a shot
i never tell on you
needy wakes up in a cold sweat gasping
shes still on the kitchen floor
she peels herself up off the floor disoriented
needy trudges into her dark bedroom
she strips off her clothes and stumbles into bed
whats up monistat
needy flicks on her bedside lamp petrified
jennifer is curled up in bed beside her reclining casually
shes freshly showered and wearing one of needys dorky t shirts
needy screams at the top of her lungs and leaps out of bed pulling the covers with her
god enough screaming already
youre such a cliche
but we always share your bed when we have slumber parties
she winks conspiratorially at needy
what the fuck is happening
i have never heard you drop the f bomb before
i saw you
i saw you
buh buh buh
slow down tardy slip
you sound like a sped
im calling the police
go ahead narc me out
ive got the cops in my back pocket
im fucking a cadet remember
what do you want
i want to explain some things to you
youve already seen too much and besides best friends dont keep secrets
needy nods terrified
remember the night of the fire
yeah it rings a bell
well i got pretty messed up
i almost died
you know those guys in soft shoulder
theyre basically agents of satan with awesome haircuts
i figured that out as soon as i got into their molester van
jennifer is crouched in the back of the van
none of the band members are speaking
nikolai wolf drives down a gravel road away from the fire site and deep into the woods
where are we going
shut your mouth object
jennifer looks around the van wide eyed
theres glow in the dark satanic imagery painted all over the walls goats heads pentagrams and strange coded writing
she sees a few books sliding around on the floor spells and incantations summoning the beast and a copy of the black mass
jennifer springs to her feet and tries to escape out the side door
mick the drummer grabs her ankles taking her down
are you guys rapists
jennifer struggles again but mick holds her down
to band members hey guys
do we even know if shes a virgin
a glint of hope in jennifers eyes
maybe if she lies she can save herself
of course im a virgin
ive never done sex ever
i dont even know how
so maybe you should find some other girl who does
told you dirk
you owe me a beer
the van rumbles down an uneven forest path deep into the woods
they arrive at the real devils kettle roaring ominous waterfalls
theres a crude stone altar illuminated by moonlight
needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor captivated by the tale in progress
jennifer is reclining in the bed with a relaxed supernatural glow
what did they do to you
just let me finish
so they drove all the way out to the falls
i tried to figure out an escape but it was so dark out there
the door of the van slides open
nikolai pulls jennifer out of the van and hustles her into the clearing
he looks up into the sky
we got a waxing moon
youre the man wolf
the four band members surround jennifer looking statuesque in their sexy rock n roll ensembles
without warning nikolai hauls off and kicks jennifer
she yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt
dirk looks apprehensive
i dont know if we should go through with this
do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from maroon
or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser
then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual
dirk obediently heads over to the van
he pushes the intimidating looking magical books aside and retrieves a single folded piece of computer paper
i found it on google
he unfolds the piece of paper and clears his throat
the guys have dragged jennifer onto the makeshift altar and are holding her down
she struggles and screams but dirk slaps her again
we come here tonight to sacrifice the body of
he tries to remember jennifers name and fails
this chick from devils kettle
my name is jennifer
dirk and mick exchange nervous glances
please let me go
ill do anything
anything you want
nikolai examines her with an appraising eye
i only hump nines and tens
youre a seven at best even with the chicken cutlets
he reaches into jennifers bra and casually pulls out a gel breast enhancer tossing it aside
jennifer rears up and spits in his artfully rumpled hair
nikolai smooths his do enraged
im gonna carve you like a pumpkin bitch
dont you know that me and my boys are in league with the beast himself
he wiggles his menacingly pointy fingers in her face
weve spent months making offerings to the man downstairs and whaddya know
we went from college radio to being courted by the majors in two months
but thats not enough jenny
we want designer drugs
we want groupies that have their own groupies
we want speedballs and stadium tours and skittles sorted by color
in short we want more
and to get more we have to butcher you
and bleed you
maybe you could just hire a publicist
make some t shirts or something
hey i could be on your street team
start chanting boys
the group begins chanting jibberish in unison
jennifer struggles watching as their eyes go hollow and black
with deepest malice we deliver this virgin unto thee
he unsheathes a huge gleaming knife and raises it psycho style admiring his reflection in the blade
dude that is a hot murder weapon
its a bowie knife
snickering nikolai begins to sing starman by david bowie
the group joins in merrily
theres a starman waiting in the sky
hed really like to meet us but he thinks hed blow our minds
as the group sings nikolai brings the knife down with a grin
we hear jennifer screaming sounds of violence and clothes ripping as nikolai relentlessly beats her and stabs her his face contorting demonically
the band continues to sing their voices carrying over the trees
nikolai walks over to where the devil side of the falls rushes into a black hole
he drops the murder weapon into the churning water smiling
needys expression is both incredulous and horrified
jennifer is totally matter of fact
she picks at her nails with a wooden cuticle stick from needys night stand
being tortured would make most girls black out or something
but im so hard core i was with them the whole time
i could feel them gutting me under my ribs up into my belly then right through my heart
im here arent i
she shakes her head annoyed with needy
i mean yeah
they went benihana on my ass
it should have killed me
but for some reason it didnt
maybe it did
anyway i dont really remember what happened after that
i just woke up a few hours later and found my way back somehow
we see jennifer staggering down the street battered mutilated and bloody
she spits a few teeth onto the curb clutching her chest
we see her wander toward needys house
i couldnt bring myself to hurt you
i mean im a really good friend
but i felt so hungry
i had to do something
jennifer is wandering down a rural road in a daze
she hears a faint cough
jennifer stops and sees a hunched figure walking down the opposite side of the street
its ahmet from india the foreign student
hes covered in soot and looks traumatized
jennifer takes a step
ahmet takes a step
their eyes meet
jennifer crosses the street
ahmet stares at her frightened
jennifer addresses him in a quiet gravelly voice
you made it out
are you lost
does your host family know youre alive
ahmet shakes his head
does anyone know youre alive
ahmet shakes his head again
come with me
well sort this out
she takes ahmets hand
as her bloody nails dig into his wrist his eyes widen
ever since then i just somehow knew what i needed to do to be strong
and when im full like i am right now im like immortal
i can do stuff like this
jennifer jams the cuticle stick into her own forearm and drags it through her flesh
needy screams and covers her mouth
she pulls out the stick
the wound seals over instantly
needy gasps and touches jennifers unmarked arm
thats some x men shit right
what do you mean when youre full
like full of tasty morsels
needy shakes her head not comprehending
youd probably tell on me anyway
not that anyone would believe you
you always think the world is coming to an end
what about my moms kia
why did you attack me out there
why were you covered in blood
you didnt even look human
jennifer rolls her eyes
you should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts youre having
were all concerned
i think hes having second thoughts about you
my arent we a c u next tuesday
let me stay the night
we can play boyfriend girlfriend like we used to
she smiles seductively
needy crawls further away from her shivering
jennifer rolls her eyes and gets out of bed
she walks over to the second story window and cranks it open
what are you doing
you said to leave
so im outtie
she climbs onto the windowsill
needy watches confused
see you at school
she leaps gracefully out the window
needy watches in stunned silence for a few moments
then she creeps over to the window and looks out
nothing there but the wind
were in a small catholic cemetery
a small neat gravel path runs through the stately old monuments into a small valley where a funeral is taking place
faint moaning and sobbing can be heard
then a procession of or goth emo kids appears on the crest of the hill
they move forward into the cemetery flamboyantly dressed in black capes chains cloaks neon hairpieces fishnets mesh hole combat boots etc
these are colin grays friends
one girl scatters blood red rose petals dramatically on the path as she stumbles along weeping
at the bottom of the hill colin grays very conservative looking family stands next to the fresh grave surrounded by sympathetic mourners
needy stands near the back looking shell shocked
there are also a few press photographers snapping photos and of course a catholic priest
we gather here today to celebrate the life of colin gray who was plucked from the prime of
the priest and family are momentarily distracted by the motley crew of goths descending on the funeral
the priest clears his throat disapprovingly
what is this disturbance
these are colins friends
a goth boy runs up to the grave and drops to his belly
take me with you
i belong down there
in the daaaarkness
those are just his fleshly remains
hes among the dark angels of the realm now
fly into the firmament
she lights a bundle of sage and waves it in the air
colins father gags appalled
is it cool if we camp here for a few days
we want to commune with his corpse
he was our spooky homeboy
children this is a private service for family only
to colins mother oh right
i need to ask you something mrs
its really important for me to have closure
young lady have some respect for this family
waving him off no
is it true that colin had a date with jennifer check the night he was killed
she says jennifer check as if it were the most disgusting name imaginable
needy covers her face
because jennifer check is a social disease
shes not like us
she thinks shes so special just because shes popular and and is what society considers attractive
but shes not sincere
shes about as emo as a breast implant
and she listens to jessica simpson and shops at hollister
and i just know colin would never go out with someone like that and i just need confirmation
so did he
have a date with jennifer check
colins parents stare at the ground
i knew it
i will erase her
ill put a freaky druid spell on her
ill spell her preppy ass right into the ground
the parents flinch
maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered colin
all jennifer check did was invite him over to watch aquamarine
she throws herself to the ground crying and pounding the dirt like a toddler
colin grays mother buries her head in her hands and begins weeping
gray attempts to comfort her
colin wouldnt have liked this
losing it oh you think so powder
yeah youre right
im pretty sure my son wouldnt have liked being eaten by a fucking cannibal and buried before his eighteenth birthday
wow you must have known him so well
the goth boy looks terrified
grays not done ranting yet
by the time they found colin in that godforsaken house he looked like lasagna with teeth
id know i had to identify the remains
my boys not in the realm of the undead
hes not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame
hes in an overpriced rosewood box thats headed six feet downtown
she kicks the coffin to illustrate
so you can take your pain and shove it up your asses kids
i got the monopoly on pain
the kids stare at her in awe
needy watches as mrs
gray collapses into mr
two girls are hanging an homemade banner on the fence surrounding the football field
it says turnabout dance needy walks briskly toward school huddled in her parka
she looks totally fucked up like she hasnt slept in days
there are hollows beneath her eyes
they did a big memorial assembly for colin at school and we had to watch another presentation about curfews and the buddy system and how to deal with grief
but nobody seemed to care anymore
sorrow was last weeks emotion
we see jennifer a few yards away talking and laughing with some other flag team members
jennifer and i hadnt spoken since our encounter in my room
actually i hadnt really spoken to anyone
i was busy with research
needy gazes off into the distance with bloodshot eyes
as she stares at jennifer she see has a series of brief gruesome hallucinations jennifer as a grinning death mask
jennifer as a corpse the lower half of her face rotted away
jennifer as a harlequin monster
needy hears the rush of her own blood the barely audible buzzing of flies
chip jogs up next to her jolting her out of her reverie
did you buy turnabout tickets yet
i dont get paid until next week
i gotta show you something
what is it
behind the school
what is it
is this about jennifer
yes but i promise you this is the last thing i need to show y needy i care about you
as a person not just a girl i made love to for four minutes the other night
and im scared of whats happening to you
youre acting really fucked up
please just let me show you
her gaze is so intense and crazed that chip has no option but to submit
he nods reluctantly
needy and chip walk to an alley behind the school
melting snow drips off the eaves
needy pulls out a large black binder and opens it
its full of copies from the library and internet printouts
the spine reads jennifer research look at this
she thrusts a piece of paper into chips hands
its something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to satan without using an actual virgin
chip stares at her
i think thats what happened to jennifer
those guys from that band were trying to sacrifice her in the woods
but what they didnt realize is that she hasnt been a virgin since junior high
jennifers a total cum dumpster
it all makes sense now
she grabs the piece of paper from him
if the human sacrifice is impure the result may still be attained but a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim
she must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon
chip looks more dubious than ever
shes eating boys
they make her strong
and when shes hungry she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends
and look at this
she holds up one of the printouts
it says that before the demon feeds it vomits a gruesome substance on its prey
like i saw
you you really think jennifer killed jonas and colin
and possibly ahmet from india
needy is silent for a moment
she realizes chip will never believe her and that shell lose him forever if she continues babbling
you think she ate those guys
of course not
is that what you think
listen ill make an appointment with mr
im real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia
my hormones and emotions are aswirl and my moods are erratic
chip isnt totally convinced but his face softens
its all right needy
this has been a crummy school year chip
needy turns and pitches the black binder into a dumpster
listen im done with all that devil stuff
do you know what youre wearing to turnabout
i was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere right here
he taps his chest
i was so in love with him
i didnt want to mess it up with my infectious crazy
only i wasnt actually crazy
everyone else was crazy
but when youre the only sane one you might as well be crazy
its subjective you know
what color dress are you gonna wear
i need to order your wrist corsage
i dont know yet
how about magenta
youre definitely a winter
my mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta
or possibly teal
oh yeah your moms an avon lady
well they call them sales reps now
well ill try to find something magenta
thatll look dope
a group of student council kids are putting the finishing touches on the dance decorations
the theme is through the trees and there are papier mache trees everywhere
needy stands in front of a full length mirror wearing a big s style magenta prom dress
it sags on her flat chest and looks ridiculous
greedo the ferret circles her ankles
toni needys mom appears behind her with a curling iron
you look beautiful
i look pork stupid
no youve got that tiny waist like a fashion model
i always thought you looked like cindy crawford
she gently takes off needys glasses
whos cindy crawford
one of the great beauties of our time
shes even got a mole like you except hers is on her face
she takes a section of needys hair and wraps it around the curling iron
youre too close to my neck
well if chip gives you a hickey you can just tell everyone i burned you
chip isnt that ostentatious
now thats a word you dont hear every day
what are you doing to my hair
aw jeez mom
if you cant have big what nots you might as well have big hair
needy stares at herself in the mirror
despite tonis best efforts needy looks like the walking dead
chip is standing in underwear and black dress socks taking his suit out of the closet
suddenly theres a loud knock on the door
im in underpants mom
we hear the voice of chips mom through the door
i need to give you something
chip puts on a robe and opens the door
chips mom is holding a small pink aerosol can
ladies pepper spray
ive been thinking about it for a while and i think you need to be carrying this
theres obviously a sicko out there who likes boys
boys your age
and i dont want you going out there unarmed
i can take care of myself
ive been using the bowflex
in the background we can see the bowflex with clothes hanging off it
did you hear what colin gray looked like when they found him
lasagna with teeth
so unless you want to wind up looking like another exotic eye talian dish take mommys rape spray
chip reluctantly accepts the spray
are you picking needy up at her house
meeting her at the dance
im gonna walk
its so warm outside
i want pictures with your sister before you go
needy is fully dressed and garishly made up
toni holds a digital camera at arms length and takes a shot of the two of them together
the mother daughter photo looks ghastly
tonis eyes are closed and needy pouts miserably
chips mother snaps a series of stiffly posed photos of chip and his little sister camille
we can see the pepper spray tucked into the interior of chips jacket
back to back
camille we dont touch ourselves down there
thats our lady garden
the gym is decorated to look like an enchanted forest
a large banner reads through the trees turnabout dance there are streamers and balloons everywhere in sickly shades of green and purple
a dj plays badly mixed pop music
couples drift into the gym
the goth kids who were at colin grays grave travel in a pack sulking
the goth girl who loved colin wanders through the decorations and pops every balloon she passes with a pin
as she pops them she narrates dramatically
popping balloon this is my heart
popping balloon my soul
popping balloon everything i once believed in
another goth girl looking exasperated grabs a balloon shoves it under her babydoll dress and pops it
she rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops it again smirking
your other abortion
i hate your guts madison
the girls glare at each other
needy walks in looking small and apprehensive in her bad s dress
she looks around for chip but hes not there yet
a few mean kids point at her dress and snicker
needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans against the wall waiting anxiously for her prince charming
chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance
he whistles to himself
across the park he sees a stray dog trotting toward him
the dog pants aggressively
chip tries to smile but looks uncomfortable
a few squirrels emerge from the trees gazing curiously at him
couples are beginning to grind against each other on the dance floor
needy watches them longingly
she checks her mickey mouse watch
chip picks up the pace jogging down the path
in the distance behind him we can barely make out jennifers form
she looks more spectral then weve ever seen her
chip speeds up instinctively
suddenly jennifers about ten paces closer
then shes closer again as if she can fold space and time
shes ethereal flickering
chip turns to look over his shoulder
the music fades out and theres a squeal of feedback from the sound system
wroblewski walks onto the stage in a bad suit
he awkwardly picks up the mic with his one good hand and pats it with his robotic one
can i have everyones attention please
the students turn to look at him annoyed by the distraction
welcome to the turnabout dance
i hope youve all had an opportunity to consume the pecan sandies and cran grape that were so generously donated by the parents club
murmuring and applause
but the real treat is yet to come
its happening right about now this treat of which i speak
we have some very special guests tonight
they were kind enough to take a break from their sold out national tour and play our dance for free
needy gags on her juice
chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park
chip makes an incoherent noise and jumps as jennifer appears improbably right in front of him
shes wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect
didnt you hear me calling your name
you werent calling my name
yes i was
i couldnt hear it
i think you were maybe spacing out
you were like this derrrrr
she mimics a blank drooling expression
yes exactly like that
listen i need to talk to you about you know who
our little needy
are you worried
cause im super stressed about her
god knows how i even sleep at night
she hasnt been the same for weeks
i think i know whats wrong with her
in fact i know i know whats wrong with her
then tell me
i feel bad telling you this
okay you know needys been a total lithium candidate since the night colin gray died
but thats not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff
i dont wanna say this
needy and colin were intimate
by that i mean he was poking her donut on a semi regular basis
chip looks astonished and hurt
i know this must be hard for you to hear
needys not like that
thats what she wants you to believe
but trust me her and colin were doing stuff you havent even heard of
total varsity moves
but you were with colin the night he was killed
well apparently he had a thing for me no surprise there
and i figured needy was busy jumping your jock that night so i agreed to a little pity date
colin brought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy
but he wanted to go too far so i left after a few minutes
next thing i knew theyd found
she sniffles wiping her eye
what was left of him
to himself eye talian
im sorry you had to hear this from me
im just so worried about needy
shes losing her shit
colin was her everything
chip looks miserable
i wouldnt be surprised if she winds up in the nuthouse
i just cant believe this
well youve been talking to her more than i have
how bad is it
its bad man
i can only imagine the paranoid theories shes come up with
oh you have no idea
i just cant believe she would do this to you
i care so much about you chip
chip glances up at her
shes earnest beautiful
more than ive ever had the guts to admit
wroblewski pauses dramatically for effect
boys and girls please welcome
the heavy stage curtains part to reveal soft shoulder in all their glory
success has treated them well theyre glowing and wearing designer rock n roll couture
they look like the young rolling stones
needy drops her cup
juice splatters onto the ground
good evening babies
are you ready for some bad vibrations
the students rush the stage shrieking
nikolai raises his fist and the band launches into a heavy uptempo version of through the trees
needy looks as though shes had a revelation
a look of pure horror crosses her face
she rushes toward the gym exit tripping in her high heels
chip is hypnotized in the glow of the streetlights
jennifer leans forward and kisses him on the neck needy didnt deserve a boy like you
needy is running toward the park in her gown
she takes off her shoes and tosses them aside her arms and legs pumping furiously
one thing people dont know about me is that im fast
i just never went out for track because i look bad in shorts
also jennifer told me track was for lezzies
but i am
fast i mean
even in that fucking afterbirth of a dress i could really tear up the asphalt
she picks up the pace cheeks puffing
i had to
i was running for his life
jennifer is kissing chip
she pulls him down onto the damp muddy grass
ooh youre so salty
yeah you too
say it like you mean it
youre so salty
i need water
the salty burns my mouth
say im better than needy
we really shouldnt be doing this
she pulls away from him feigning a guilty conscience
youre better than needy
jennifer smiles satisfied
she resumes kissing him enthusiastically
this feels weird
can we go somewhere else
i have just the place
she stands up and starts to lead chip toward an abandoned fenced off community pool
its drained and spooky and looks dangerous
i dont think we can go in there
i knew some skater guys who went in there
they got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for hours
jennifer giggles and pulls him along
youre in big trouble anyway
she begins to climb the chain link fence
needy jogs toward chips house
exhausted and sweaty she presses the doorbell
she falls to her knees on the front stoop panting and wheezing
camille answers the door
well hi there camille
is chipper home
camille has no reply
she eyes needy suspiciously and licks a popsicle
chips mother appears and shoves camille aside
is something wrong
he left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago
he certainly should have been there by now
dove you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous godless times you let your only son walk alone at night
well its only five blocks
my god your hair is
which way did he go
he usually cuts across the park
she turns to scold camille
camille lets sit like a lady
no one wants to see your kiki
she turns back to address needy
why dont you try
but needys gone
murphy pool is even eerier from the inside
the fenced in deck area is littered with garbage abandoned pool furniture and graffiti
someone has spray painted the word hopeless on a wall
chip shivers and looks around nervously
jennifer nonchalantly unzips her dress and shimmies out of it revealing her bra and panties
arent you cold
im hot like magma
she prances over to the abandoned pool and begins to climb down the ladder on the side
the pool is full of filthy freezing water
what are you doing
come on in chip
show me your breast stroke
the water looks disgusting
its not so bad
are you kidding
its totally bubonic in there
i think i see a dead possum with a doritos bag in its pouch
and that looks like a used syringe over there
he slaps away a fly
i was just trying to make you laugh
i think now more than ever we need laughter
weve both lost a close friend
chip nods sadly
i feel so empty
please come here and kiss me again
make all this madness go away
chip tiptoes forward tentatively and sinks to his knees
he leans in and kisses jennifer whos still clinging to the ladder
the sound of buzzing flies grows louder
suddenly jennifer opens her eyes
she hooks her arm around chips neck and lunges backward
they tumble off the ladder into the pool
needy runs into the park and scans the dark horizon
her bare feet are bloody from running and her face is shiny with sweat
a terrified scream in the distance
needy whips around hikes up her skirt and starts running toward murphy pool
she reaches the fence and starts climbing it
she slips and cuts her hand on a broken link
chip screams again on the other side of the fence
she flings herself over the top of the fence her body slamming against the concrete pool deck
her arm snaps
its a compound fracture the bone thrusting through the flesh of her arm as she screams
needy staggers toward the pool which is surrounded by an extraterrestrial glow
chips moaning is almost unbearable
needy stares into the abyss and claps her hands over her mouth
jennifer is waist deep in the dirty water flinging chip against the wall like a rag doll
hes still conscious but his skin on his chest has been ripped off to expose his ribs
jennifer is chewing happily
chip looks at needy his face a mask of agony
jennifer begins gnawing on chips neck so engaged in the task that she doesnt notice needy
needy climbs up on the diving board and crosses herself
saint jude patron saint of hopeless causes please give me the power to crush this bitch
jennifer looks up with demonic bloodshot eyes just as needy leaps off the diving board
needy lands on jennifers shoulders taking her out
she wraps her legs around jennifers neck and drags her under the water
needy grabs her by the hair and girly slaps her furiously across the face
then she spots the pepper spray lying by the side of the pool
she grabs it and sprays it in jennifers eyes
jennifer shrieks and vomits nasty spiny gore all over needy and chip
fuck this j
jennifer rockets straight up into the air like a goddess hovering ten feet above the pool
her eyes burn
her skin is corpselike
shes drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze
she can fly
shes just hovering chip
its not that impressive
jennifer speaks in a metallic demonic sounding voice
god do you have to undermine everything i do
youre such a player hater
needy glares at jennifer surprisingly fearless
youre a jerk
nice insult lizzie mcguire
got any more harsh digs
you know what
you were never a good friend
even when we were little
you used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be ugly ashley when we played barbies
and now im eating your boyfriend
at least im consistent
why do you need him
she begins to weep
why do you need the one guy whos ever liked me
you can have anyone jennifer
the cutest guy in school
you could probably even have a huge star like chad michael murray
so why chip
is it just to piss me off
or is it because youre insecure
jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts down landing on her feet
needy crawls out of the pool and faces her down
i am not insecure
god what a joke
how could i be insecure
i was the snowflake queen
yeah two years ago
when you were socially relevant
you were skinny then too
a look of abject horror on jennifers face
she reels back against the chain link fence her eyes blazing
im gonna eat your soul and shit it out lesnicki
her voice is now an unearthly growl
in the background chip is slowly painfully pulling a pool skimmer with an eight foot handle off the pool deck
i thought you only murdered boys
i go both ways
she hurtles herself toward needy roaring her eyes white hot her jaws agape
chip suddenly stumbles in front of needy and holds the handle of the pool skimmer in front of them like a spear
as jennifer flies forward at demonic speed she impales her entire torso on the handle
theres a beat of deafening silence
chip collapses on the pool deck
jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet shishkebabbed on the giant skimmer
with effort she pulls the handle out of her body in several stages
ow ow ow
needy watches and realizes jennifer is injured
blood drips onto the pool deck
we hurt you
blood trickles out of jennifers wound
she tries to plug the hole with her hand
got a tampon
needy shakes her head mutely
thought id ask
you seemed like you might be pluggin
she begins to climb the fence wincing in pain then glances over her shoulder at needy and chip
where are you going
fuck this noise
you losers are more trouble then youre worth
she continues climbing
why give up now
hes almost dead
get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both
i mean you say ive been a bad friend all these years
i might as well throw you a bone
she smirks and jumps over the fence stumbling off into the distance
needy watches her her eyes narrowing with hate
once jennifer has disappeared needy turns her attention to chip who is barely alive
she stares in horror at his torn arm and exposed ribs then falls to her knees over his body
you saved me
im gonna call for help
she reaches into chips pocket and pulls out his beat up cell phone
she wipes off the prickly ooze with her hand
oh no im out of minutes
i think is always a free call
needy dials to no avail
the phone is hopelessly clogged with ooze
she knocks it against the deck
its not working
its full of jennifer goo
chip begins gagging and coughing
he rolls onto his back his eyelids fluttering
hey im going somewhere
youre not going anywhere
im toast needy
im definitely gonna die
i think i already died before you were here but i woke up when i heard your voice
i love you
yeah me too
and you look hot in that dress
youre clearly delirious
when youre dying you can see everything a lot clearer
you can see whats true and whats not
the things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them like a picture of the baby jesus or barbara walters when they use the special lens
and i know for sure that youre totally hot
needy begins to sob hoarsely
youd better get out of here
the police are going to come and i dont want them to you know make a mistake
im never leaving
but i have to go
chips eyes close
his face relaxes
needy wails at the top of her lungs
she rests her head against his mutilated chest oblivious to the blood and bone
the dance is in full swing and students are slow dancing
girls rest their heads against boys chests only under far less macabre circumstances than needy and chips deathbed tableau
soft shoulder are still playing onstage their guitars chiming melodically
the bass player dirk turns toward nikolai wolf
this sucks old man balls
its good pr
he accidentally speaks into the mic attracting unwanted stares from the kids
to audience i said its so good to be here
the students cheer approvingly their faces bright and hopeful
nikolai bares his teeth in a frighteningly fake smile
illuminated by lamp light needy limps toward the gym entrance
shes completely covered in demon goo
her face is bloody her hair is full of blood and guts and her broken arm looks gruesome
in the background yet another oblivious couple are making out
needy stops to stare at them her gaze calm but obviously insane
they break apart and stare back at her
what are you looking at clumpy
just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face
what did you say
needy bends over casually holds one nostril closed and does a farmer blow
a bloody clot flies out of her nose
the guy takes a good look at needy and blinks startled
are you supposed to be goth or something
did you know the original goths were a germanic tribe that settled in rome
they didnt wear black
they wore regular linen tunics
i dont know why nobody else knows that
the couple have already resumed making out
needy rolls her eyes turns away and continues limping into the gym
needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her
people ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage
theyre too busy slow dancing and laughing in their respective cliques
she looks up at the stage where soft shoulder are playing an insufferably long coda
nikolai noodles through a guitar solo then looks up and sees needy looking directly at him her eyes full of hate
nikolai gulps nervously and elbows dirk
needy points to her eyes with two fingers then points at nikolai as if to say gotcha
she looks completely possessed
to dirk we gotta get out of here
i think this girls flipping out
what could she do to us
look at her
dirk takes one look at needys face and takes off his guitar
nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage
the music stops abruptly
the kids in the gym murmur and complain confused
needy tries to follow them
she limps blindly toward the stage and climbs up
everyone watches gasping in horror
by now the band is disappearing out the side door of the gym
into the mic you didnt play your hit yet
but theyre gone
needy looks out at her classmates
they stare back
she they found chip the following morning
the police couldnt find an explanation for the substance in the pool so they chose not to mention it to the press
in fact they treated the whole incident like a bad dream
we see the police including newly minted officer roman duda informing chips mother that his body has been found
she collapses onto the floor curling up into the fetal position
trouble was some of us would never wake up
needy is lying in bed shaking her arm in a cast
her mother tries to rouse her
i never went back to school after that
didnt talk much either
my mom bought some books so she could teach me at home like crazy christians with kids do
but i wasnt a very cooperative student
needy pulls the covers over her head
toni shrugs resigned and tosses the book on the floor
needy is crouched outside jennifers window hiding in the shrubbery
she looks almost feral with wide eyes and a hungry expression
through the window we see jennifer sitting at a vanity and combing her hair oblivious to the intruder in her yard
what nobody realized was that i was doing a different kind of homework
i was watching her every night
we see jennifer putting the comb down and examining her hair with a appraising eye
waiting for her to get weak and dull
waiting for her to burn through the life force shed stolen from chip
needy creeps away from the window
it took weeks but i finally made my move
were seeing a flashback of the night needy slaughtered jennifer
needy plunging through the window
the arrival of the police
even in her last moments of life she somehow managed to be cooler than me
we see for a moment jennifers sly challenging smile as needy raises the boxcutter to slash her
that signature look of mastery and control
she left an insanely hot corpse
we see jennifers mother holding her again screaming though all we hear is silence and static
sure enough jennifers bleeding body seems to be artfully sensually draped in her mothers arms
she almost seems to be smirking at us
were back in solitary confinement where needy has been narrating the whole sordid tale
she hasnt moved a muscle since beginning her story
only a single shaft of moonlight illuminates the room
an orderly shoves dinner through a slot in the door
its a pile of mystery meat
needy wrinkes her nose
i dont even know who needy lesnicki is anymore
im a different person now
a person who uses curse words and kicks orderlies and and sees things that arent there
a very bad very damaged person
needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline of her shirt
but sometimes change can be good
for instance most occult scholars dont know this but if youre bitten by a demon and you live you just might absorb some of the demons abilities
in the moonlight we see needy still has a infected looking bitemark near her shoulder
she scratches it wincing
you just might get lucky for once in your miserable life
pull back to reveal that needy still cross legged is hovering five feet off the floor
with visible concentration she slowly flies up toward a narrow window positioned up near the ceiling
to anyone with normal abilities it would be impossible to access
needy reaches the window gazes at it for a moment then smashes it with surprising strength
needy strolls across the grounds in her bunny slippers
she heads confidently toward the security fence and passes through it after casually mangling the bars
only a needy shaped hole remains
needy is striding purposefully down a dark country road
the hospital recedes in the background
a few raccoons gather by the side of the road watching needy as she walks past
a pickup truck whizzes by with its windows rolled down
through the trees blasts from the radio
needy begins to sing a lopsided grin on her face
through the trees i will find you
heal the ruins left inside you
devils kettle citizens are gathered around murphy pool crying
its a candlelight memorial for chip
their faces are weary and sorrowful
photos of chip have been arranged around the edge of the fence
we see a picture of chip and needy on the end
someone has brought a cd player and the mourners sing along their voices soaring
and the stars will remind you well meet again
needy holds her thumb aloft as she walks down the remote country highway
well meet again
a small creek emptying into a stream runs parallel to the road
needy seems something glinting at the mouth of the creek and stoops to pick it up
its nikolais bowie knife the one he threw into devils kettle never to be seen again
needy picks it up and tucks it into her waistband
a station wagon comes rattling up the road
needy sticks her thumb out again
the wagon pulls over to the side of the road
the driver a grizzled older man rolls down the window
he eyes needy lasciviously
where you looking to go young lady
east toward madison
guess im headed that way
but im gonna need you to pay me in ass gas or grass
no free rides in this wagon
i dont have any money or drugs so youll have to settle for ass
hop in my chariot
needy gratefully hurries into the drivers seat
so why you headed east
im following this rock band
must be a hell of a group
tonights gonna be their last show
needy smiles blithely and pops the clear lifesaver into her mouth
the station wagon pulls off
as it sputters off into the distance we see a road sign that reads ironically soft we hear the song on the radio end segueing into the djs bumper
what a song
thought wed play that one in honor of soft shoulder
theyre playing in madison tonight
should be a night to remember
the djs voice fades out as the car vanishes into the horizon
