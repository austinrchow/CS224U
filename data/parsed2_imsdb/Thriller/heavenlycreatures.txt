sanatorium dayjuliet lies on her bed writing to pauline
she has entered into the spirit of the thing greatly
as we listen to juliets v
we see scenes of tb hospital life
the meals brought around
my dear charles i miss you and adore you in equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited but as i languish here in this house of
disease and decrepitude my mind turns with increasing frequency to the problem of our son
sanatorium juliets room dayjuliet sits at a desk

her word putrid spelled out
only yesterday i was compelled to execute several peasants just to alleviate the boredom
school art class daypauline is hunched over a painting in the art class daubing great strokes of red paint onto a violent medieval carnage
diello insisted on coming along
in fact he made such a fuss that i had to let him yield the ax himself

not just the prisoners but the royal guard my valet and several unfortunate copped it as well
images of paulines painting people being run through with swords heads coming off etc
sanatorium dayroom dayjuliet is sitting writing in the sunny dayroom
i am despair enough to put diello in the hands of the cardinal in hope that a good dose of religion will set the young chap on the right path
reverend norris hello again
juliet peers up at a dog collared vicar
she eyes him coldly
reverend norris how are you getting along
it must be awfully hard being away from your school chums
ive got something here you might just like to have a look at
he hands juliet a leaflet featuring a thin withered figure in a great deal of pain
jesus loves you is printed across the top
juliets face hardens
reverend norris unfortunately modern medicine can only go so far in combatting an illness like tb
and thats why im here
because with the power of god miracles can happen
the lord has said that those who have faith will be saved
reach out juliet
reach out for jesus
during reverend norriss speech
camera closes in to big close up of juliets face

a silhouetted figure rises up behind reverend norris
a lumpy hand closes around his throat
reverend norris aaaaarghhh
diello the plasticine figurine now life size drags reverend norris off his feet and across the room
reverend norris kicks and struggles as diello hauls him through the doorway onto

for a silver ring set with a small pink stone
it is lying on the ground as if dropped by somebody

herbert is at a drinks cabinet unscrewing the top off a bottle
henry your daughters
an imaginative and a spirited girl honora if shes spending too much time at your house you only need to say
all those nights she spends over shes assured us that you dont mind
henry its rather more complicated than that
hulme and i have returned home juliet has been behaving in a rather disturbed manner
surliness short temper
general irritability most uncharacteristic
is pouring a drink
sure i cant tempt you to a nice sherry dr
henry no thank you
the thing is
yvonne hasnt been herself either
locking herself away in her room
sits down next to honora glass of sherry in hand
henry my wife and i feel the friendship is
no arguments there dr
all that time inside working on those novels of theirs
they dont get fresh air or exercise
frowns at henry
concerned im not sure what you mean dr
henry pauses for a moment
henry your daughter appears to have formed a rather
unwholesome attachment to juliet
worried whats she done
henry she hasnt done anything
its the intensity of the friendship that concerns me
i think we should avert trouble before it starts
henry hands a business card to honora

bennett do you like your mother
pauline hesitates for a moment
bennett and why is that
she nags me
bennett and thats why you like to stay with the hulmes
pauline looks wary
she doesnt answer
bennett or is it because you want to be with juliet
bennett do you
bennett why not
bennett but juliets not silly
theres nothing wrong with having a close friend but sometimes things can get
such associations can lead to trouble
it isnt good to have just one friend
my wife and i have several friend and we enjoy seeing them on a regular basis and its all perfectly healthy
perhaps you could think about spending time with

bennett i agree mrs
rieper its not a pleasant word
but let us not panic unduly
this condition is often a passing phase with girls of yvonnes age
but shes always been such a normal happy child
bennett it can strike at any time and adolescent are particularly vulnerable
but what about the vomiting
shes lost a lot of weight
bennett physically i can find nothing wrong
ive checked for tb and shes clear
i can only attribute her weight loss to her mental disorder
bennett look mrs
try not to worry too much
yvonnes young and strong and shes got a loving family behind her
chances are shell grow out of it
well medical science is progressing in leaps and bounds
there could be a breakthrough at any time

to close up of pauline
the shock is too great to have penetrated my mind
it is so incredible
hulme was absolutely kind and understanding
a conversation between henry and the two girls
the large lounge at ilam is dark and cold
the mood is bleak
he said we must tell him everything about our going to america
he was both hope giving and depressing
we talked for a long time and deborah and i were near tears by the time it was over

love you can still write to each other
softly touches paulines cheek
pauline winces averting her face
to extreme close up of paulines eyes
anger against mother boiled up inside me as it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path
suddenly a means of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me
if she were to die

juliet struggles in hildas arms pushing her mother away screaming
pauline stands holding the dead phone
pauline turns and faces her mother
please dont be like this love
pauline gives honora a cursory glance and walks past her up the stairs
honora looks after her a hurt expression on her face
i did not tell deborah of my plans for removing mother

juliet sweeps down the stairs in a rush of sparkling light
she is dressed in her mothers glittering ballgown
juliet takes paulines hand and together they sweep into
ilam lounge day
paulines drab clothes transform into a ballgown as she passes through the doorway
the song soars as they waltz into the middle of the ballroom
in a blur she sees decorations and faces all around
pauline gasps as diello takes her by the waist and waltzes around the room
characters from borovnia fill the room
juliet dances with charles
a man in a dark suit turns around
he launches into the second verse
pauline laughs happily as she is swept around and around
we realised why deborah and i have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do
it is because we are mad
we are both stark raving mad
they are no longer in the lounge at some point the waltz has dissolved into
borovnia castle courtyard night
the courtyard in borovnia castle
the crowds continue dancing to the loveliest night of the year
a doorway in the courtyard
henry hulme is lurking in the shadows peering out
he is dressed like a jester with cap and bells
the camera pushes in
to a distorted fisheye shot of henry
continues building in intensity
hulme is mad as mad as a march hare
at the conclusion of the song
two burly borovnian executioners swing their axes down chopping a couple of ropes
a huge banner unfurls down the side of the castle tower
in embroidered letters three stories tall is the word
paulines face flinching at the sound a flash of light
black white image of orson welles shooting a pistol from the third man
it was the first time i had ever seen it
deborah had always told me how hideous he was
pauline and juliet are sitting in the cinema absorbed in the film
it is appalling
he is dreadful
i have never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness
but i adore him
christchurch streets nightpauline and juliet run along dark damp atmospheric streets
orson welles steps out of the shadowy alley into the light

they scream and flee along the balcony only to be greeted by orson at the other end
they run back into the bedroom and collapse onto the bed screaming and giggling
to paulines exalted face
we talked for some time about it getting ourselves more and more excited
a huge shadow of a figure dressed in hat and cape rises on the bedroom wall behind the girls threatening to engulf them
pauline comes down on top of juliet kissing her on the lips
paulines hands slipping juliets blouse off her shoulders
we enacted how each saint would make love in bed
juliet heaves on the bed pauline leans over and
morphs into orson welles

diello swinging from side to side as he hacks a peasant to pieces
intercut with shots of pauline and juliet intertwined with orson and diello
pauline and juliet sometimes change into their plasticine counterparts deborah and gina
we spent a hectic night going through the saints
it was wonderful
we felt satisfied indeed
we have now learned the peace of the thing called bliss the joy of the thing called sin
pauline and juliet are soaking in opposite ends of a steaming bathtub
a few moments silence
juliet looks blankly at pauline

some sort of accident
a moment of silence

our main idea for the day was to moider mother
pauline and juliet walk toward the house
unicorns are grazing in the ilam garden
fairies dance in the air
large dragonflies hover around the girls
this notion is not a new one but this time it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out
we have worked it out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea
naturally we feel a trifle nervous but the pleasure of anticipation is great

a series of cards explains what happened subsequently in the hours following honoras murder a police search of the rieper house unearthed paulines dairies
this resulted in her immediate arrest for the murder her mother
juliet was arrested and charged with murder the following day
after paulines arrest it was discovered that honor herbert rieper had never married
pauline was therefore charged under her mothers maiden name of parker
in august a plea of insanity was rejected by the jury in the christchurch supreme court trial and pauline parker and juliet hulme were found guilty of murder
too young for the death penalty they were sent to separate prisons to be detained at her majestys pleasure
juliet was released in november and immediately left new zealand to join her mother overseas
pauline was released two weeks later but remain new zealand on parole until
it was a condition of their release that they never again

the screenplay was pages long
fran my understanding is that you were the first to become interested in the parker hulme murder case as a film subject
it seems to be a popular topic in new zealand
frances walsh well popular topic im not sure about that
but its certainly a piece of new zealand criminal history that has entered into the realm of myth
and as a young girl growing up i knew about it and had read lurid newspaper accounts lesbian killers rampage
fw yes yes
and i also got my hands on a novel called obsession which i read when i was about
i thought at the time that it was extremely good
laughs it takes a very damning view of the girls its written by two english journalists who came out here to cover the trial
it was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize the case
and there was also a play wasnt there
fw yeah theres been a play and there have been nonfiction books written about it
theres also been a great deal of coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines so its always had a profile here
since it had already been treated in all of these different ways what compelled you both to explore the subject again
peter jackson well we didnt really think it had been treated that well
nothing that we had read did we particularly like
and also the other various treatments all seemed to have a specific agenda which attempted to make political statements about the murder
what interested us was to show these two year old girls with no other agenda than to be as accurate as we possibly could and to somehow imagine what was
going on inside their minds
i know that all of paulines voiceovers from the film are from actual diary entries
you made an interesting comment awhile back about how they actually informed the structure of the film
could you elaborate on that
pj well the structure was fairly apparent once we started to do research
it wasnt just the diaries themselves it was the general research
we read as much of the diaries as we could we havent actually ever seen the full unedited diary but we gathered as many of the excerpts that were releasedat
the time of the trial as we could which amounted to quite a few pages
and we read the newspapers and interviewed people and then the three acts sort of materialized quite neatly
you know act one is when the two girls meet and become friends and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you realize that they
are now bonded
fw its when they have their first delusional experience together at port levy where they go into the fourth world
you know these two girls have an imagination thats going to lead to something interesting happening
the second turning point comes with the decision to murder mother which tips the story into the third act
whom did you interview to cull together all of this information
pj well we went through about or people
we wanted to interview as many people as we could find
we talk to about or of their classmates which was experience
these were year old women spread out around the country and they all had changed their names because theyd gotten married
it was quite a detective job to find them
i read somewhere that the school was not particularly enthusiastic about this did they help you locate the ex students
pj no the school didnt want anything to do with it
christchurch girls school had erased these two girls from their history
the yearbook that had the class photograph with pauline is no longer available
if you go to the school library they have all the yearbooks available apart from s which has her photo in it
it sort of cleansing of the books
the school didnt recognize what it was we were trying to do which was to redress the issue
why wipe these girls off the school records
i mean they were human beings
fw peter and jim booth the producer of the movie went to see the headmistress of the school and after they explained what we wanted to do and allowed her
to read the script her only comment was why cant you make a film about pupils of whom we are proud
pj we also heard from several sources we interviewed that on the day after the murder happened the headmistress at the time stood up in front of the assembly and
said no girl is to discuss a certain matter
this was like the day after two of their pupils had murdered somebody and they couldnt even refer to it directly
forty years later we got the sense that the school was exactly the same
and that really gave us all the more reason to make the movie because we felt that these people were still living in the s
we found that with a lot of the people we interviewed that even though years had gone by they were still presenting attitudes of the s this was some dark
sordid little thingthat was best kept quiet and should never be mentioned
many times we got why on earth would you want to make a film about this
we should just forget about it and hope it will somehow disappear
and we actually thought about doing that
but within or years most of the people connected with it will be dead and at that point in time well never know anything about it
we felt it was a good time now while there were still quite a few people alive to do the interviews and try to get something accurate for the record
we were also aware of the responsibility we had because film is such a persuasive medium and we knew that unlike any other medium the newspaper accounts the play itcan
give an audience visual images which in a way almost replace the real event especially if you werent born at that time
so we thought if we made a film now perhaps people in new zealand would look upon this case in a different way
that was a responsibility we felt that we didnt want to take lightly
pertaining to that quest for accuracy how does one go about reconstructing for instance conversations between pauline and her mother or other scenes for which there is no direct documentation
fw well all you can do is attempt to find out as much as you can about the people involve the type of people they were their class background etc
so to that degree we spoke to people who knew the riepers for example who had good knowledge of the girls
did you interview any of the boarders in the rieper house
pj yeah i did very briefly
we found one of the boarders who spoke to me on the telephone
i did the interview and then the following day i called him back to ask him some more questions and he clammed up he didnt want to talk to me
hed obviously gone home to his wife and shed wound him up about the whole thing and told him he shouldnt be involved with it
fw i think our understanding when we set out to write this was that we would never be able to re create the right interiors with characters who precisely reflect
the people who were really there
our intention was to be true to what we understood of the girls friendship and the nature of that friendship and the nature of those families from which those two
it was never an attempt to re create reality
we could never do that obviously
so we went into those things with the spirit of trying to reflect the situation rather than reality
pj the hulme family were a lot easier to research than paulines family because the hulmes were public figures at the time
henry hulme being the rector of the local university there were obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors students who worked with him
hilda hulme was also quite a public figure
they were in some respects the royalty of christchurch because the english class system was and still does exist down there and they all take these things quite seriously
there used to be garden and tennis parties at ilam and there were a lot of people who had social contact with the parents and juliet at the time
the research actually carried on through the shooting of the film
i remember when we were in england auditioning actresses for the part of juliet before we found kate winslet and we found out that the late anthony quayle the english
actor had actually visited the hulmes in christchurch in the s so we tracked down his wife and spoke with her
the research just kept on going all the time
we had trips to christchurch to do our research but once we started working on the film we moved there for nearly five months so it was an ideal opportunity
to find others
wed hear things about this person who had sat next to pauline in typing class and wed rush around to see them
im sure the production got a certain amount of notice in the local media so people probably approached you
pj to an extent but not as much as what we had hoped
paulines people were actually quite difficult to research because they just werent public they were quite private people
fw we have heard subsequently that paulines sister wendy has seen the film
she still lives in christchurch
her con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her home at that time but her criticism was that the family was better than that we
had portrayed them in too shabby a light
and that really touched me
pj she thought that the portrayal of the tension between pauline and her mother was very accurate
it was nice because wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it
she absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists with anyone so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to us
it was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film
she thought it was good but incredibly difficult to watch
in gathering all of this material im sure there were certain things that didnt fit dramatically
was there anything you were tempted to use but didnt because it was either too sensationalistic or too ethically questionable
pj there was one area we deliberately steered clear of that we felt ultimately didnt have a relation to what we were wanting to tell and that was that in
the rieper household there was actually a younger sister named rosemary who had downs syndrome who is still alive wendy still looks after her
at the time of the murder rosemary was only years old
this made honoras life all the more difficult the daughter lived in a special home and would come home on the weekends
pauline writes about rosemary a lot in her diaries she was very fond of her
but it was one area where we felt that we were being too invasive into the privacy of this family
as you say there was quite a bit of stuff we had to leave out for structural reasons
paulines diaries are very very funny
we ended up using a lot of the more dramatic material in the movie in the scenes in which shes talking about murder and suicide but unfortunately we had to
leave a lot of the funny things out
she records hilarious conversations that she and juliet had and its all very witty
sometimes we used diary entries and just dramatized them as opposed to using a voiceover
like the sequence where they go into the fourth world where the hilltop changes into a magical landscape
that is described in detail in the diary
so it was a case of having to be very selective and at the end of the day it was the more dramatic selections that made it through to the
movie rather than the funnier stuff
the girls sense of humor does manage to come through in the film though
im thinking for instance of the last scene in the rieper house when the family is having lunch with juliet before the two girls and honora go to victoria park
were their snide comments about sir edmund hillary in the diary or were they invented by the two of you
fw that was out of our imagination
we were told that they were extremely jolly at that last meal it was actually in the court records and that they were cracking jokes and saying silly outrageous things
on a sort of giggly high
and we knew that wendy had worked at farmers the localdepartment store and also what had been very big in the news that year was sir edmund hillary a new
zealander climbing mt
he had been knighted and became a huge national hero he still is
because hed also spent time in christchurch we felt that this was an appropriate thing for them to send up because whatever they did they were terribly irreverent
if the queen was visiting for example they wouldnt bother to go out unless it was to take note of the decorations the pomp and ceremony to enrich one of
their own royal celebrations
they really had no respect for the icons of the day their interior world was much more important to them
the film critic for time richard corliss likened you to a physician who assumes a patients fever in order to understand her illness
at what point did you two decide that this was going to have to be presented from the girls point of view
pj i think from the beginning
that was one of the motivations for doing it
none of the accounts we came across were from the girls point of view
like wed said before they all had other agendas so we felt that telling the girls story was important
it did take us a long time to be able to do that because it took us a long time to learn who they were and what was driving them
we were a bit confused there was a bit of mystery at the beginning but the more we read the more we talked to people we gradually began to formulate
who these people were
ultimately there was a lot of pauline that i could recognize in myself which was very useful
you too fran
fw i felt that the diary offered the first insight into the friendship and into pauline in particular
it was an extremely interesting account of her life documenting both dramatic and mundane events with a great deal of literary flair
she was a very imaginative funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas as teenagers do and i warmed toward her immediately
reading the diary made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything else
and i thought it would be great to take that journey to find out who she was
because no diary of juliets survived we have heard from people that she did keep a diary but it was destroyed i thought it would be harder to get to
know her but that really wasnt the case because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with people she was much more of a social creature than pauline
so it was a combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding that we got from talking to their school friends inparticular that gave us insight into
the nature of these two girls and the way they appeared to the rest of the world
i think its fair to say that both peter and i felt hugely sympathetic toward pauline and juliet and we did start to identify and empathize with them all the
while trying to keep in balance the knowledge of this terrible act
it was that dynamic of really liking them but feeling abhorrence at what theyd done that kept the thing alive for so long in our minds and gave the film
peter your camera work in all of the films youve directed is extremely dynamic
in heavenly creatures the almost hyperactive camera seems to have an organic relationship to the girls euphoric state
ive noticed in this script that a lot of these camera directions are written in with more detail than most other screenplays ive read
do all of your scripts read like this
pj in this particular screenplay camera movement came quite readily during the writing stages
at the end of the day the script is not the document we want to go out and sell its the document that the cast and crew have to read
when we write a script intended for me to direct its right from the beginning a shooting script a document for technicians to use
you know the grips put a circle around the word dolly so they remember on that particular day of shooting theyre going to have to have it on the truck
with this movie probably more than any other ive done the camera moves were integral to the scriptwriting
ill tell you where that came from the music
we read very early in our research that pauline and juliet were both obsessed with mario lanza
neither of us were familiar with his music so we went out and got some of his records and before we started writing we played through them and came across
several songs that we really liked
one of the very first ones we heard was the donkey serenade fw well we knew that was important to them because pauline had named one of her novels the
pj when we heard it just the life and vitality in the song immediately indicated steadicam
laughs it immediately told you you had to have a moving camera
we chose all the songs that were in the movie and in the case of the donkey serenade wrote scenes around them
i found it a great visual tool
its never happened before in anything ive done i mean ive never had the music in advance
we had these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to write a scene
at the same time the music helped me visualize so that visualization ended up going down on the page
of course once you actually arrive on the set and you have the actors and the camera people there things can change
i dont regard anything thats written into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in stone
how long did it take the two of you to finish a first draft
pj not really long
i think the first draft was written in probably or weeks
but we didnt start to write until wed uncovered several months worth of research
and the draft were publishing is the shooting script
i think thats about draft number five
we did an interesting thing
we did a certain amount of research first while we were still working on braindead dead alive in u
and then we wrote the first draft from the position where we felt we knew some of the facts but there were a lot of gaps
we thought if we wrote a draft we would know where the holes were and we would know what we had to pursue in terms of research
for instance fran and i had never been down to christchurch when we wrote this first draft and christchurch is such an integral part of the story
then we made the trip down there before the second draft and were able to modify a lot of things interview lot more people
we actually did that on purpose because we wanted to nail the story before overlaying it with a lot of historical detail
how do the two of you handle writing collaboratively
pj well it depends
you know if frans working on some re writes while were shooting and im on the set shell show me some work that shes done when i come home and
well revise it together but generally when were actually writing the initial drafts of the script its always together
i think that we both have a good understanding of structure which helps and im obviously very visually oriented and fran is very good on dialogue and character so we
complement each other quite well
i think the best advantage that we have in writing scripts together is that we write a script that i go and make which is i think a wonderful thing
it would be a strange experience for us to write a script that someone else was going to make because weve never actually experienced that loss of control that so
many other writers have
so right from the very beginning its a movie
its not a piece of writing thats going to go out to the marketplace and may or may not sell
just one little thing
even though heavenly creatures was very much written by the two of us my favorite scene in the movie was written by fran by herself
which one is that
pj well it was late one night and we were hoping to finish the first draft of the script it was like ten oclock already and we had arrived at
the sequence in the tearooms where theyre having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track
we sat there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene
we knew theyd actually gone there to have tea because wed spoken to this very elderly woman who had served them
she said they were talking quite calmly to one another
but what dialogue do you put in their mouths at this particular moment when this womans about to be murdered
well the phone rang and i got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this call for about minutes and i came back and fran had written something
she asked me to check it out and it was never revised its where she slides the plate with the last cake over to honora and says go on mother
it was perfect
i know you found kate winslet at an audition in england
how did you come across melanie lynskey who played pauline
i understand she was not a professional actress
pj well its one of those stories that sounds like its not true
we wanted to cast someone in new zealand and wed auditioned a lot of people five or six hundred who were either videotaped or photographed
i wanted to find someone who was young around s or years old i didnt want a year old in a school uniform
and we wanted someone who was physically very much like the original pauline i have a thing about being as accurate as possible
so we quickly exhausted the professional actors in new zealand who happened to look like pauline theres only about one or two
laughs we knew we were looking for someone with no experience but we just had to find them
we kept saying somewhere in new zealand theres somebody whos perfect for this role
we were actually about four weeks away from beginning shooting and we had one or two people on the short list neither of whom we were happy with but we
were coming under enormous pressure to cast one of them because you know the wardrobe department needed to make costumes and so on and fran said to me youre not really happy with the choices are you
and i said no
and she said this is crazy weve spent all this time and energy on this film and we havent found pauline
this is something close to a major tragedy
i was in christchurch so fran decided to drive with a casting person around the lower half of the north island of new zealand she was prepared to drive as
far as she had to
theyd visit every small town go to the local school visit the principals office and show a photo of pauline parker
shed say were making a movie about pauline parker do you have any pupils in your school who resemble her who might be interested in this
fw we were in a rusting ford cortina and we had no official i
wed roll up to these provincial schools and wed be greeted by some curious teacher
although no one ever once questioned our authenticity we would always get asked about the car if youre in films why arent you driving a porsche
both laugh so then i would pitch the story to the entire classroom scanning the room the whole time looking for sullen brooding school girls all the while thinking what
would she look like with her hair dyed black
pj i guess that went on for about a week
every night id get a call from fran
anyone that was vaguely appropriate was videotaped and i got a couple of tapes in christchurch and it was a bit depressing
finally fran called from a small town called new plymouth and said i think ive found someone very interesting
and this was mel
we flew her down to christchurch and gave her an audition and a screen test and we cast her two weeks before the film started shooting
i called her mother up on a friday night and said id really like melanie to do the film
and she said when does she have to start
and i said well shes got to come down here on sunday
the poor girl didnt even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her locker
do you think there was any correspondence between the two actresses and their backgrounds and those of the characters they were playing
pj one of the things that we knew about pauline was that she was incredibly witty and intelligent and melanie was very similar she was the top student in her
province in many subjects
and we knew if we cast an intelligent person then they were going to hit it
melanies also very enigmatic
the character of pauline doesnt have an enormous amount of dialogue
in a sense the real pauline parker speaks for her through the diaries
so what we were looking for was an actress who has that kind of aspect to her thats a real movie star thing where you can film somebody sitting in
a room doing nothing and theyre still fascinating to watch
we found that in mel
ive read that you used actual locations for some of this
pj as much as we could
the only location we couldnt use was paulines house which had been torn down
fortunately the school is now a community center the actual school moved to a different location so they no longer had control over the buildings otherwise wed have definitely been
the school buildings are now owned by the christchurch city council which has done nothing to them theyre as they were years ago
they just rent out the various rooms to community groups
we found out what classroom pauline and juliet actually were in and it was the canterbury womens embroidery guild it sounds like something out of monty python and we went
into the room and right down one length of the wall was this huge tapestry that had been stretched out on this massive frame
i thought they would never want to take it down but we managed to get them to do it
so that was the actual classroom where they were down to the seating
the ilam house where juliet lived is still there
its owned by the university and they were very happy for us to use it
as for the doctors surgery where pauline is interviewed by the doctor we found out the address and you know this is years later so you have no idea what
to expect it was just like a suburban house
we thought that was strange in that it didnt seem like a doctors office
anyway we knocked on the door and the woman who answered happened to be the doctors daughter the doctors long since dead and we asked her where her fathers office
had been and she said oh he had rooms out the back of the house here weve never really touched them
we went into this doctors surgery which was almost exactly the same as it had been years before
so we ended up filming those sequences in the actual room where pauline was interviewed by the doctor
we also spoke to the woman who was working at the tearooms at victoria park and found out exactly where they sitting and filmed that scene there
actually about two months later that building was demolished
and what about the murder scene
pj well we went to the murder site and we just felt uncomfortable about filming there
it was very strange and maybe it was just our imagination but it was very quiet very tranquil
i mean all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds and suddenly when you arrive at the spot you hear nothing
so we filmed the murder scene at victoria park but it was on a different track about a hundred yards away
there is one sequence of scenes in this script which didnt appear in the film
it begins with the tennis party at ilam in which pauline and juliet are watching from behind some shrubbery as walter perry and hilda hulme play tennis
pj well that sequence was actually shot and exists in the version of the film that was screened here in new zealand
when miramax released the film in the u
they had screenings and felt that the film was too long
we had final control over the film but they pleaded with us to take out about minutes worth of footage convinced that it would be tighter
we looked at it and we actually ultimately agreed with them in a funny sort of way
that sequence slows the momentum down
its quite a fun one to read and its fun in the film as well but it does slow things down at a point where we didnt think things should
be slowing down
although weve had control over the films release all over the world weve requested that the sequence be cut out of the versions screened in every other country
when youre writing a script a part of you thinks oh this is perfect we mustnt change a word of it but once its finished it takes a life of
we felt that the sequence wasnt telling us anything wedidnt already know about the characters and at a time where the tension in paulines house was really growing going over
to juliets house to watch a tennis game was not necessary
fw i think when we wrote the script we felt it was very much pauline and juliets story
after the edit however it became very evident to us that it was paulines story which was the through line and the audiences focal point
whenever we veered too much into telling the hulme story and pauline wasnt on the screen the pace started to flag
that was something we had to look at after the first assembly we had to trim and cut hulme scenes because they werent as fundamentally interesting as the rieper scenes
although this film is very different from braindead both take place in the new zealand of the s
im not that familiar with your country but from watching these two films i would have to assume that it was at least in that period a fairly repressive kind
of society acting almost as a breeding ground for transgression for explosive kinds of behavior
pj well the script for braindead was set in the modern day up until the very last minute
i was worried going into the movie that the hero of the film named lionel acted in a fairly nerdy kind of way he doesnt socialize he takes care of
his mother and yet we wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film
i was afraid that if it was set in the modern day the audience especially a young audience would really jeer at this character and not be able to relate
to him at all
if we set it inthe s people might actually feel more sympathy for him because they would think well that sort of thing happened then
with heavenly creatures it was really just a coincidence that the actual event had taken place then
fw but that repression is still very much in evidence here were i not expressive were not demonstrative were scared of showing saying too much
when you go to new york for instance and people are yelling and the horns are blaring if that happened here someone would get out of theircar rip open your
door and bash you up
theres a level of violence a subtext of violence running through new zealand society that comes out in our movies
we have a veneer of being easygoing but underneath were full of rage
its an interesting social dynamic
and it makes for interesting art but its not so pleasant to actually live in it
its very much to do with a link with england pj christchurch in particular
fw christchurch suffers from it more than any other city in new zealand
its always been described as a little piece england its considered to be more english than england
its always aspired to be that and it still is in some ways
pj the thing with this murder too is that the sense you when you talk to the older generation in christchurch is that it was an embarrassment to the city
that it was somehow shameful and somehow humiliating
which is ridiculous because the story is ultimately a family tragedy
fw its been said that christchurch was more appalled by revelation that paulines parents were not married than by the murder itself
and some uncharitable souls even suggested that one sinful act led on to the other
speaking generally about your films you both seem to have a certain love of campiness which is apparent in the use of caricatures for many characters as well as in
an overall sort of extremism reminiscent of the work of someone like john waters here in the u
whats interesting about heavenly creatures is that while it remains a fundamentally realistic docudrama some of the figures of authority like the doctor the vicar and the headmistress are hilariously
pj well i like movies to be entertaining to be a little larger than life
with something like braindead obviously theres no problem doing that
but with heavenly creatures we were telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story
at the same time however i still wanted to make a movie i didnt want something totally tied to real life and totally dull
so we did have a little bit of fun with some of those characters
i guess if you were trying to justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls point of view but thats not strictly true
i just think that there were really only two people who we needed to be realistic with and they were juliet and pauline both of whom were slightly larger than
thats something that came across in the interviews with their classmates
they were remembered as being sort of terrifying juliet was so confident and loud and pauline was brooding and dark
so in a sense the film was a perfect one for us
i dont like doing stuff thats totally naturalistic
i just like having a little bit of fun
the fantasy sequences are written pretty much as they appeared on film
were you aware of how technically you were going to handle these special effects as you were writing
pj pretty much
we hadnt used any optical or digital effects in braindead and with heavenly creatures i knew that if i actually wrote digital effects into the script then it was a
great excuse to go out and get this new equipment i have my own special effects company
so right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could only be done with morphing
we got one computer and hired someone to figure out how it all worked
what about your use of the plasticine figures
was that something youd heard the girls were interested in
pj yeah we interviewed several people who remembered that they used to model figures in plasticine and i think herbert rieper refers to it in his court testimony
we also interviewed an old guy who had been round to the hulmes place and had seen juliets plasticine horses on the mantelpiece
and of course there are endless passages in the diaries about borovnia and diello the murderous prince and all of that
when we thought it would be fun right at the beginning to go into some of these fantasy sequences the last thing i wanted to do was dress up actors
in medieval costumes and crowns and have them looking like something out of a school play
so we decided it would be really fun to tie the plasticine figures and borovnia together
and we knew theyd sculpted figures like diello so we just thought why not have those figures come to life as it were
what about the linking of certain actors to certain figures like orson welles to diello
pj well that was something that we devised ourselves
but again that springs from the fact that the girls used to give pet names to people
like one of the boarders in the diary for instance is referred to as john for a while and then his name changed to nicholas
thats referred to in the scene in paulines sleepout
pj yeah and for some reason pauline refers to him as nicholas in the rest of her diary
that happened with a lot of people
they were clearly using real live people as prototypes for some of their fantasy characters
we figured that diello had a lot of qualities that they seemed to fear in orson welles
he seemed to represent some sort of dark sexual force so we figured that giving his features to the figure of diello was appropriate
could you talk about the fact that during production anne perry the mystery writer was outed as being juliet hulme
fw well where do you start
we knew that would be a possible outcome of making this film that someone might try and track down either pauline or juliet
which was a very good reason not to make the movie
we had more compelling reasons to make the film however because if we didnt anotherone was going to get made anyway
there were at the time the film was being funded five competing projects in various states of preparation
didnt dustin hoffman have something in the works
fw his company punch productions i believe had a script written by an american writer peter had in fact been very tentatively approached to read it that was how we
found out about it
at that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot
and then someone was trying to do a film version of the play weve already spoken of and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version of the story
then thered been a screenplay written by the late english novelist angela carter that was with a production company in auckland and there was someone in australia developing a screenplay
so we knew that this story was going to come to the screen soon there was no doubt someone was going to make it
and we felt that in that climate we would proceed despite the possibility that these women might be exposed
we knew that in paulines case it was less likely
wed heard a lot of rumor and gossip about juliet but wed heard nothing about pauline and i think she has very carefully hidden her identity
juliet went to no such trouble she took her stepfathers name hilda hulme ended up marrying walter perry as a novelist and proceeded to write a series of crime novels
you can look up any contemporary author index in any library and there is anne perry and her birthdate is the same as juliet hulmes her mothers maiden name is
the same etc
there is a gap in her personal history where she leaves out new zealand but it picks up again after she left the country
so it didnt take a huge amount of detective work from the journalist here in new zealand who had heard that anne perry and juliethulme were one and the same
that rumor sprang from a production of the play that had gone on here a year before we started shooting where a friend of juliets who was still writing to
her confided in one of the actors that juliet hulme was now writing murder mysteries as anne perry
that rumor hew around the acting community here in new zealand and it reached our ears on the set and it was something that we wanted to entirely disassociate ourselves
from because we knew it would damage the film and we knew it would damage us
it was inevitable that we would be accused of exploiting this womans situation in order to promote the movie
when this journalist rang peter and asked what comment he had about the story he just begged her not to print it
of course that was a hopeless situation because she was a tabloid hack who was going to go ahead and make her name and she has dined off it ever
we felt an enormous amount of dread because the movie hadnt had a chance to stand on its own before this was made known and its now been inextricably linked
with this revelation
so weve been battling that ever since
but given that its happened weve had to deal with it as she has
pj i mean we were absolutely disgusted by some of the ads miramax ran
on the day that this was released in america i rang miramax and said for heavens sake dont associate this film with any of this because we dont approve of
and a couple of months later lo and behold we get sent by a friend in the states clippings with these ads saying murder she wrote and these other references
to anne perry that miramax had been running and we were just very very angry
did you fever consider using the coordinates of the actual event but changing enough of the particulars to push it into the fictional realm
pj no because the case is so well known in new zealand it would be like fw fictionalizing the o
pj its unnecessary
i mean sure if it was just a movie for international consumption then yeah
but the fact is that we werent actually making this film for an international audience
we were very much making it to try and rectify years of misunderstanding about this case within new zealand
in a way that was our main motivation for making the film and in doing that we obviously had to use their real names
but having said that pauline parker and juliet hulme ceased to exist as people in because they both took different names
in a sense i dont think there was any moral problem with using those names because they themselves stopped using them some odd years ago
were there any other films you looked at as inspiration before writing this
fw well we looked at movies like let him have it which was based on the craig bentley murder case in england bentley was an year old with a low
who was hanged for murder
although i think that film has quite a lot of merit in the end it comes across as a grim dark true life murder story and similarly dance with a
stranger which was about ruth ellis the last woman to be hanged in england
we felt that if there was one thing we didnt want to do it was to make a depressing murder film
we really wanted to tell a tale of a friendship rather than a murder story
sure the movie ends with a murder but for the most part it celebrates friendship
pj we wanted to make it a lot funnier than those films
and people have said its such a serious subject why did you try to make it funny
well obviously the murder wasnt funny and we never attempted to make it funny but the friendship was funny
life is funny generally human beings like to enjoy themselves and there was no doubt that pauline and juliet had a hell of a good time most of the time
fw but the other reason why it was important that we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth for anybody growing up
when youre at that age you become very focused on things in an extreme way
and i dont think pauline and juliet are so very different from anybody else i think several things went wrong in their lives juliets parents broke up and pauline became
very alienated from her family she was an obsessional manic depressive character and i think it was this terriblecombination of things that led to this extraordinarily horrible act
but its not something that can be precluded from anybodys experience in growing up
adolescence is such a crazy time
pj a lot of women have come up to us and said i was pauline
that was me
that was my childhood
i dont think its that unusual
i think what is unusual about the whole thing is that these aspects of paulines character led to the murder and i dont think the sort of person she was
was particularly unusual or freakish or weird
when we hear things like that its the best possible endorsement we could get
