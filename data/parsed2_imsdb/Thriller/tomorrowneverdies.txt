screenplay by bruce feirstein for educational purposes only super the khyber pass afghanistan were looking down at what used to be called the end of the known world
a landscape that is both beautiful and forbidding
in the center of this vista there is a deep ravine
pushing in on the ravine there appears to be a giant icicle hanging over a cliff an ice fall
a foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid
pushing in still closer there is a tiny black dot inching its way up the ice
a human figure
this is bond is sweating and straining four hundred feet in the air
he has an ice pick tethered to each hand ice cleats on his boots
a black backpack
as he climbs spider like pulling himself up he goes to jam a cleat into the ice but crack
a foot stiletto of ice breaks off crashing onto the rocks below
regaining his foothold bond looks down certain death
he looks up so very very far to go
bond shakes his head there has to be an easier way to earn a living
still bond climbs
huffing sweating he goes up and up until hes feet from the top
he drives a first ice pick in
gets a toehold
but when he slams the second pick in and is now dangling feet in the air staring at a torrent of water hanging only by the leather thread around his
wrist attached to the first ice pick still embedded in the wall
and coolly begins to swing himself back and forth in widening arcs like a clocks pendulum
at the high point of his swing bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice but misses
he looks up at beginning to work its way out
the tether fraying
cautiously begins to swing a second time
and on the third arc he swings the ice pick viciously but misses again
now jutting downward barely holding
the tether is almost totally frayed through
one last chance
he reaches back hurls himself at the wall lunging and smashes the second pick into the ice
just as the tether finally snaps on the first one
still hes all but home he reaches over grabs the first pick barely holding in the ice jabs it in and continues upward
exhausted bond reaches up over the edge
he drives a pick down through the ice into the hard flat ground beneath the waterbed
as he pulls himself up his full weight on the first ice pick he smashes a second pick through the ice into the waterbed and breaking off with a groan
tumbling onto the rocks below
a torrent of water crashes over
fighting the oncoming deluge he crawls on his belly through the water feet inland
bond stands walks out of the riverbed
he looks back at the cliff on either side of the water there are two small radar dishes angled down scanning every inch of the area save for the waterfall
in other words this was the only way in
from his backpack he takes out two cigar sized black canisters and an elongated black box
he presses a button on the side of the box and fwap fwap fwap snow skis unfold
he presses buttons on the canisters telescopic ski poles
bond slaps on the skis and takes off through the snow
bond hurtles over the side going airborne landing feet below amidst boulders
in perfect olympic form he skis out and down
bond slaloms down in and out of trees to avoid detection
at the bottom where the snow thins he comes to hiding behind the rock bond takes off his skis knapsack
he unpacks and unfolds a high tech automatic rifle
puts on a headset
he creeps up on the rock and looks out on feet down yards away men are unloading cargo from a dozen military transport trucks there are two north korean mig
s on the ground one partially obscured by a truck plus flatbeds carrying helicopters and scud missiles
near a quonset hut a truck mounted radar dish scans the area with infrared gatling guns mounted on either side
props his rife on the boulder and peers through the gun sight
he sees a closer but still wide telescopic view of men bargaining over weapons and forklifts loading unloading crates of munitions
over a speaker seven in position
watching this display is m tanner and a handful of military brass including a russian general bukharin and british admiral roebuck an aging sea lion with no love for m
m deals with the humorless admiral by well humoring him what were you saying admiral
something about this not being a job for a wine sniffing skirt chasing playboy spy
ill be sure to acknowledge s assistance in my report to the prime minister
but this is still a naval operation
what do they say in russia general bukharin
asks questions in flawless russian the general chuckles
translates in a joint operation someones nose always gets put out of joint
m turns to admiral roebuck im interested in success admiral
not who gets credit
turning to mr
tanner what have we got
tanner points to the video wall with a red laser pen
ironically a regular terrorist swap meet
death at discount two chinese long march scuds a pair of soviet a attack helicopters interrupting stolen and the crates look like american m assault rifles chilean antipersonnel mines six
french exocet missiles and no maybe a hundred kilograms of czech made c semtech explosive
beat something for everyone
fun for the whole family
freezing him with a glance what about ids
pushes a button on a console one to seven deal the face cards
bond adjusts a knob on the scope
on the video screen the picture zooms to a close up of one of the arms traders
tanner presses a button and almost instantly the mans bio and vitals appear on another video screen
neo nazi former east german stasi agent
ties to the beider meinhoff gang
pressing a button aces high seven
bid to the east
bond shifts his aim east
intercut as necessary he zeroes in on another face and the mans stats appear in london

cruise missile away firing officers voice contd time to target four minutes
i appreciate your assistance m
but this is now a military operation
urgently to tanner bring up the tracking satellite
and get out of there
tanner hits a button and a third video screen appears displaying a satellite view of the area detailing the cruises path and progress
one to seven exit target area
repeat seven to one
bond has taken his eye from the scope
hes peering at the mig s mig and mig a forklift appears from behind the truck blocking the view of mig l a tall bald man is riding the empty
fork with his back to us
puts his eye back on the scope shifts the rifle bonds scope view settles on the bald man
the forklift reaches the back of the truck
he steps off as the fork begins rising to unload something
and as the man turns facing us to scan the area oh no
who is it
calling up his stats kim dae yung
north korean nuclear specialist
meaning there may be nuclear material down there
a look passes from m to bukharin to roebuck
hugging the surface crossing from water to land
time to target three minutes
on the screen the fork lift has pulled a red box from the truck a short round man appearing with it
who is that
whats in the box
punching buttons i dont know

he shrugs whats in the box
sheepishly we usually

i want you out of there
do you copy
bonds headset lies on top of the rock along with the telescopic sight still broadcasting
find bond crouching behind the rock
automatic rifle in one hand grenade in the other
he pulls the pin hurls it feet away
waits counting down time
then bond springs
shoots at one of the crates
it blows up just as theres panic on the ground
men running everywhere as the radar gatling gun spins and sends a hail of fire at bonds diversion
and with this bond is off sprinting into the chaos
tanner whispers god help him
god help the rest of us
as various factions shoot at each other whos the traitor
bond streaks toward the action
without breaking stride he swings his gun to the right two bursts
three men die
still running he swings to the left another burst
two more down
ahead bond sees the flight crews dashing for the migs
he makes a beeline for mig
slamming the gate on the red box in a cargo truck
rushing to the passenger door
the short round man floors the accelerator driving them away
time to target thirty seconds
wide on mig the pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit
running at full tilt bond leaps pulls the man down
they fall to the tarmac fighting
bond shoves a knife in the mans ribs killing him
kneeling bond takes the pilots helmet off
he looks up a man is coming at him with a gun
in one unbroken move bond yanks the knife from the pilots body and throws it thwack into the mans heart
where the copilot having climbed in from the other side sees its not the right guy
as he fumbles for a weapon bond bashes him with the helmet
the copilot collapses into his seat unconscious
bond settles into his seat fires the engines closes the double canopy and begins taxiing out
the cruise skims in directly over bonds plane speeding to takeoff
bonds mig bond shoves the throttles to the fireball and ka boom
the scene on the screen erupts in a giant explosion then turns to video snow
is bond alive
no one in london knows
the fireball grows and grows a raging hell
and just when it seems no one could possibly survive bonds mig rockets out of the flames
bonds mig bond thinks hes safe
until mig flies out of the fireball cannons blazing at
a hail of metal and tracers
bond goes into evasive maneuvers jinks right jinks left when suddenly the copilot revives and starts trying to strangle bond with a metal lanyard
struggling bond hears a thin high pitched the pilot has locked onto bonds mig
two heat seeking missiles roar away
fighting the garrote bond kicks the throttles forward and pulls back on the yoke
the mig goes into a spine crushing climb as bonds mig has disappeared from the pilots view not in front
not on the left
not on the right
where did he go
the pilot looks up fighting against the garrote bond strains to reach a red button on the panel copilot ejector seat
bond finally taps it and the back half of the canopy blows off
the copilot blasts out of the plane downward directly into mig s cockpit
bond peels off
for a second mig hangs in the air
the two heat back in mig bond fiddles with the radio
seven to base
i have a full house
the situation room erupts in cheers
by the way thank the general for all his assistance
over and out
goes to afterburners
and from the fiery glow of the engine we after credits fade in on all ivy and bricks
and a certain aston martin db parked
afterglow empty champagne bottle
rumpled sheets on a sleeper sofa
bond is in bed with a smart ironic and yes stunning ish chinese woman jenny wu
note the chinese here is mandarin spelled phonetically
running a finger across her lips and what do you call these
ja shwa tsway
these are lips
indeed they are
kisses them lightly deadly little things
his hand goes beneath the sheets
and what do you call these
the gang of two
smacking his hand laughing stop it
i was just getting to the interesting part
weve already done the interesting part
do you forget
he moves to roll on top of her but she pushes him off teasing sakwa
is that mandarin or cantonese
tousling his hair im late
i have to get dressed
she hops off the bed leaving frame
bond settles back on the headboard ready to enjoy the view
when his cell phone rings
lightly hello catching himself hello
moneypenny at her desk
i hope im interrupting something important
jenny has a leg on the bed pulling on a full victorias secret outfit nylons garter suspenders bustier etc
not at all moneypenny
i was just brushing up on a little chinese
in the background jenny insists i am not little
im sure she is james
but im afraid youll have to kiss off the rest of your lessons this afternoon
mock chagrin moneypenny
here i was finally getting a feel for a new tongue four oclock
m will meet you in the conference room
bond watches with amusement as jenny wu slips a graduation type gown over the lingerie
it may take me a little longer to wrap things up here
dont be late
hanging up tsi tien chien penny
you always were a cunning linguist
au revoir mon cher
moneypenny hangs up looks up and blanches m is standing there
walking away i dont want to know
bond and jenny wu emerge from the office
shes still in the gown
they pass a flock of young students good afternoon professor wu
then to bond are you sure you cant stay for the lecture
but i did enjoy the dress rehearsal
she gives him a wry glance opens a door to a lecture hall
tsi tien mr
tsi tien professor wu
she exits bond walks off passing underneath a wall mounted tv set
on the tv set the hnn globe logo the harmsway news network spins into view followed by youre watching hnn the harmsway hour news network
coming up mortise shot of valentin zukofskys stunning victory in the ukrainian presidential elections
mortise shot of live coverage of the latest hnn communications satellite launch from xichang shi chung china
and mortise shot of a special report on the situation in hong kong since the chinese take over from great britain
the db drives past the guard
debriefing bond m and several others listen as nato colonel dominique everhart early s belgian refers to video clips from the khyber pass sequence to sum up after analyzing the
tire inflation of the fork lift in the mi video tape nato believes the red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of u weapons grade uranium an incredibly hard incredibly heavy incredibly lethal substance
and thats enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices
depending on the builders sophistication one crude bomb that could devastate london paris new york berlin or all four if they have the latest technology
theres a pregnant pause in the room
and the participants
pointing at the screen kim dae yung
moscow trained north korean nuclear weapons specialist apparently fell out of favor with the current north korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a british light
water reactor in south africa an accident that left him entirely hairless
another face appears on the screen col
dominique everhart contd and rendera sikrahm also known as richard stamper
freelance mercenary laos and cambodia
his father was from nepal a ghurka warrior con scripted by the british government to fight in china during world war ii after which the family settled in hong kong
where the young stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the hong kong chinese and local british
beat aside weve all read about the signs at the british swimming pools in hong kong that said no ghurkas allowed
nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful
stifles a smile then in conclusion both these men have a vendetta against the world
they are nuclear armed and dangerous
and having failed to get the uz through the old opium route the khyber pass its natos belief that their next attempt will be through bulgaria where the nato nuclear
strike force will be there to stop them
thank you colonel everhart
stands turns to id like to see you in my office
why dont you and the colonel exchange numbers if you need more information
bond approaches dominique
she smiles warmly
theres a mutual attraction but theres something else going on unspoken
interesting video tape
they point i shoot
feels her pockets do you have a pen
i just got promoted and dont have my new cards yet
bond hands her a pen
she regards it cautiously
does this do anything
depends what number you write
she gives him a wry look starts to write
he notes her wedding band
smiles i didnt think so
for an instant something crosses bonds face bittersweetness
either way shes scored a subtle victory
i gave you my assistants phone number
if its urgent she knows where to reach me
beat holding her gaze take care you too
with a sphinx like smile she watches bond leave
where bond encounters moneypenny also walking to ms office
weve got to stop meeting like this
they may be on to us
enjoy your meeting
in the darkest moments its what i live for
especially since ive heard how much you like to watch
on the hidden camera
moneypenny cuts bond a look and in the background sees dominique leave the conference room and walk down the hall away from them
by the way james ordinarily i would never ask but
werent you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea
have you ever known me to kiss and tell
theyve come to a security door
she punches in a code actually ive never known you to do either
but we all want what we cant have
not all of us
the door opens
they go into what no lust for adventure
its just that ive learned from personal experience that when we get what we want beat somehow the reality is never as
satisfying as the fantasy
moneypenny smiles wryly points to the inner door dont keep m waiting
m is behind her desk minister peter johnstone sits across a high handed teflon coated politician with the survival instincts of plutonium
theyve been arguing
you know the minister
nods to minister johnstone
bond sits in an armchair
m presses a button and a video bio of eliot harmsway appears on the wall behind her
mid s regal
tell me what do you know about elliot harmsway
quipping only what i read in the newspapers
disdainfully his newspapers
glancing sideways occasionally yes
directly to m british media mogul
born in hong kong controls newspapers tv radio cable satellites books magazines movies computer software
holding up a copy of along with tomorrow the first world wide newspaper
able to topple governments with a single story as he says in his press
bond looks at johnstone quizzically
then a very tight lipped m
he senses hes about to enter a minefield whats harmsway done
it seems weve received a tip a rumor from an anonymous source that sir elliot may be involved with stamper and yung and the missing uranium
idle chatter from a source you cant identify who insists on talking only to
nothing but loose talk and innuendo
that may be the case at present minister johnstone
but our own sources suspect that mr
harmsway used his considerable russian media holdings to elect valentin zukofsky president of the ukraine in trade for the uranium
m has punched a button and valentins video bio has appeared
more scurrilous unsubstantiated gossip
but it does explain how an ex kgb agent turned illegal arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long time friend of the people
beat if you believe what you read in the papers
annoyed need i remind the two of you that elliot harmsway sir elliot harmsway is directly descended from the earl of aberdeen
that his scottish ancestors practically invented hong kong and out of sheer gratitude queen victoria herself named the port aberdeen harbor in their honor
long pause then no more than i need remind you minister that merely being a member of the lucky sperm club does not preclude one from a life of criminal
johnstone is reeling
m continues to bond with aplomb the reason i invited the minister here was to reassure him that this investigation will be handled with the utmost discretion
which is also why ive withheld this information from nato and our allies
nods then recalling didnt we once investigate harmsway
he was furious at the british plan to return hong kong and supposedly started his own negotiations with the chinese government
the inquiry went nowhere but it did earn mi a rather powerful enemy not to mention the chaos it caused at whitehall when his newspapers began screaming for the recall
of the sitting government
a beat then im sending you to venice
youre to check out the source determine whether elliot harmsway is involved with the enriched uranium and if so stop him
how will i meet the informant
she hands bond a carnival mask youre to wear this mask at the venice carnival and wait to be contacted
standing to leave there is one last thing elliot harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation
hes also a major contributor to the party
i expect him to be given every consideration
to the best of my recollection mr
bond i suggested no such thing
beat at the door in fact i was never here
and he exits
m frowning hits a button on her intercom would you send in the new man from equipment branch
i hate to ask but
did you ever think youd miss communism
we serve the interests of the british people
no matter who we may be foolish enough to elect
bond is silent chastised
m looks away then looks back but if elliot harmsway is involved with that uranium i want him prosecuted to the ends of the earth
hopefully it wont get that far
m looks up malcolm saunders qs successor limps in looking like a mummy plaster casts on his left leg left arm neck brace crutch
come in saunders
what is it this time
rocket in the leg
machine pistol in the arm
qs retirement party
id just put the knife into the cake and come on
i know better than that bond thwacks the crutch against the leg
saunders grimaces in pain
it must do something
if you insist
saunders flexes his broken arm armored spikes pop out of the it
the die is cast
saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with m
he takes off the cast and neck brace and places a briefcase on ms desk
now pay attention
we havent much time to demonstrate your new q toys
how is old q
big game fishing
beat sonar torpedoes
retirement gift from his friends at the cia
saunders has opened the briefcase
bond tries to look inside but saunders repositions it
saunders continues in the meantime perhaps this will spark your interest
takes out a disposable lighter cigarette lighter
thumb here press here a small flame appears
bond unimpressed reaches for it saunders ive lit cigarettes not from forty feet
saunders flips the lighter sideways and whoosh
a burst of flame shoots across the room
the disposable lighter also contains a small self detonation charge beat depending on who or what you wish to dispose of
bond takes the lighter begins to play with it
next he takes out a pair of shoelaces
plastique explosive shoelaces
holding them out at length cut them to regulate the size of the blast totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe
examining them curiously perfect way to tie up a
frowns moving along he produces a typical plastic security card
name here magnetic information stripe here pointing to and a code breaking microprocessor here
swipe it through any card reader anywhere youre in
does it work on cash machines
saunders is suddenly stricken
he blurts out it was an authorized test
i returned the money
amused i see
ignoring this finally your new watch blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks press this button the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter
needling him if you cant do the time dont do the crime
smirks at bond pauses then oh
i almost forgot
there is one last thing before q retired he asked that i give you one other protective device
he hands bond a wedding band
a wedding band
what am i supposed to be able to do with this
i believe qs exact words were imitating q emphatically hopefully nothing
bond turns from saunders devious grin to an amused m
smiles ill give you a ring from venice
good luck on your mission
he snaps the ring down on her desk
till death do us part
a gleaming white yacht with two on board helicopters and a huge tarped hold dominates the harbor
harmsways sea dolphin ii
tonight however we find a gondola gliding through the water
arriving at a festively lit dock crowded with gaily costumed partygoers and musicians in medieval garb
wearing the mask from ms office and a bright blue cape bond alights the gondola and plunges into the crowd
a swirl of colors noise and music
pushing his way into the chaotic celebration bond scans the crowd looking for a face nothing but a sea of masks
caught up in the tumult he turns left he strains to turn right anxiously looking for the contact
who is it
three masked women appear in front of bond
they curtsy and giggle
buona sera signore hes spun by a masked man with a bottle
bond waves him off and is jostled in the other direction by a group of celebrants carrying a long banner
suddenly the crowd surges forward a procession carrying the effigy of carnival is making its way through the square
locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd bond struggles to look forward left right when he feels a tug at his cape from behind
he can only crane his neck to see hear i may have been followed
meet me at the church in five minutes
with an effort bond turns to look at her but sees nothing save the wisp of a satin costume disappearing as the crowd closes ranks behind him
five minutes later
a few stray couples
the masked woman appears walking tentatively between the shadows and the moonlight looking for bond
an arm reaches out and yanks her into an alcove
looking for someone
recovering her breath it was a violent yank the woman paris removes her mask
she shines a sexy watt smile at hello james
he is not happy to see her
what are you doing here
is that any way to say hello
i thought your specialty was good bye
paris smiles coyly
she lifts a hand to tousle his hair oh james
ive missed you grabbing her by the wrist is this another one of your games
youre hurting me
cant you just be nice
ive got half the british government breathing down my neck
i dont have time for your nonsense
shes surprised and hurt by his coldness
dont you even miss me
didnt i mean anything to you
she turns away from him fighting back tears
bond doesnt care what about elliot harmsway
or is this just another one of your stunts
hes crazy hes insane
he hates everybody
hes got these plans facing bond becoming hysterical youve got to help me james
im sorry for everything
i know i was wrong but youve got to protect me
i know you still love bond slaps her
shes angered do you feel better now
not giving an inch do you
she turns away
bond feels remorse for hitting her
softens what about the uranium
its on the boat
hes holding a press conference tomorrow
bond reaches out to touch her
she falls into his arms burying her face in his shoulder
im so sorry james
i promise ill never leave you again
patting her head shhhhh
just hold me
bond thinks for a moment then gently pushes her away a foot backwards to look in her eyes how do you know harmsway
paris eyes flicker at something over bonds shoulder
she swoons kiss me
she pulls bond to her kissing him then hauls off belting him across the mouth
leave me alone
she shoves him off darts away
bond is bleeding from his mouth and not altogether surprised at her behavior
he turns to see paris running to four men dressed alike in three corner hats enveloped from head to foot in black capes
their faces are completely concealed behind flat bone white masks covering all but their chins
they look like messengers of death
the leader is stamper the others are locals thug
thug is built like a bank vault
stamper looks steadily at bond who is he
just some drunk
leave him alone to thug take her to the boat
he sees stamper and the two henchmen approaching
he turns and walks quickly toward pushing past carnival goers bond rushes up the central staircase of the bridge
at the top looking onto the main span he sees the effigy of carnival procession approaching like a tidal wave
bond throws a look over his shoulder and sees the three men rushing up the stairs knocking people out of the way like bowling pins completely unaware of the oncoming
parade at the top
bond turns to face the men
and suddenly throws his cape up dramatically like batman blocking their view of the procession
stamper and the two thugs hesitate for a moment and bond pulls the cape to his body just as the procession surges past him and spills down the stairs overwhelming
to himself flexing the cape so thats how he does it
bond disappears into the oncoming crowd
stamper and thug are pushed to the bottom of the staircase but thug bulls his way up shouldering through the crowd
as bond nears the bottom of the staircase he looks back up thug is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine tossing carnival goers aside like rag dolls
spotting bond he charges but gets caught between two men carrying a satin banner
he goes right through it ripping the material apart with his bare hands pulling the men down after him
bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade
he sees a group of tourists posing for a photo by the bridge and just beyond this a street seller hawking souvenirs from a push cart
bond approaches the tourist with the camera offering to take the picture for him
bond takes the camera
the tourists pose
and with perfect timing bond turns and pop
sets off the flashbulb in thug ls face just as he comes around the corner
bond flips the camera back to the tourist grazie and heads for the pushcart
wheeling it around he shoves it at the thug who is still stumbling blinded by the flashbulb
the cart slams into the man knocking him on his back
the cart stops on top of him pinning him down
bond takes off threading through the crowd toward a sidestreet
meanwhile the street seller rushes to his wrecked cart
it erupts in the air as thug jumps to his feet
hes getting really pissed off
he looks around for bond just catching a glimpse of him as disappears down the sidestreet
thug makes a bee line for bond but finds his path blocked by two motorcyclists chatting away
barely stopping thug lifts one of the motorcycles with the driver still in the seat and throws it stamper and thug arrive at the wrecked cart in time to see
thug disappear onto the side street
stamper motions for thug to come with him on a parallel course along the canals toward bond enters the deserted plaza from the side street
sticking close to the buildings he ducks into an alleyway
shrinking back into the shadows bond peers out into the plaza
stamper and thug charge in
bond watches as they split up and start looking for him
suddenly a huge hand grabs s shoulder spinning him around thug has bond in his grasp with murder his eyes
in one fast move bond side steps ducks and twists out of the cloak throwing it over the thugs head
and as the thug struggles to get out from under it bond slams him head first into a wall knocking him out
hes left sitting upright slumped against the wall
bond heads off down the alleyway away from the plaza toward the courtyard of il bovolo
thug enters spots the figure in bonds cloak
very quietly he pulls out his gun kneels
and as he brings the gun up to the cloaked figures head chambering a round the cloak erupts with thug viciously biting thug s gun hand hurling him against the
with a frustrated fury thug rips off the cloak and stands
marco i didnt know after him
they charge off
bond enters from the alley scans the courtyard three walls
no way out
save for a spiral staircase that leads up to the fourth floor interior balcony overlooking the courtyard
bond takes the marble steps two at a time
the two thugs enter the square
motioning for quiet they hear bonds footfalls on the steps and race up after him
coming off the staircase bond tries the doors to the interior of the building locked
too heavy to burst in
he glances down at the courtyard and hears the thugs footsteps running up the stairs
bond glances up to the roof just above his head the only escape
pocketing his mask bond hops on the banister reaches for the gutter
he pulls himself up throws a leg over onto the roof and disappears from sight
just as the thugs enter the balcony from the staircase
bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra cotta roof
there are sheer drops on three sides but the fourth side is a one story drop to an adjoining building
lands on another steeply pitched roof unable to get a foothold on the tiles he slides down rolling to the edge
he looks down the adjoining building is one story lower with a skylight roof
as bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof thug holsters his gun and climbs on the banister
hes too heavy to climb onto the roof by himself so thug shoves him from below
thug searches for bond
he hears bond moving below him on the next building
he makes a running leap
bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as thug lands
the thug sends bond sliding down toward the edge of the roof then loses his balance and slides down after bond
at the edge of the roof bond is about to slide off onto the skylight below but grabs the copper gutter at the last moment
is now hanging fifteen feet above a glass skylight
as thug tumbles off the edge of the roof and saves himself by grabbing onto they sway in the air for a second
the gutter bends breaks and the two of them fall they land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the great hall
bond is winded
he grabs bond by the collar hauling him up on his feet
thug shoves the nose of his gun under bonds chin forcing up on his toes
snarling he thrusts his face menacingly close to bond i owe you some pain
with lightning speed bond grasps the thugs elbow and yanks his gun arm forward as bond pitches his head back
bonds chin just clears the barrel as the gun fires into the ceiling
the flash momentarily blinds thug
bond snatches a candelabra and smashes it against the thugs arm knocking the gun away
as bond draws his walther the thug grabs bonds wrist and brutally yet effortlessly squeezes the gun from s hand onto the floor
with a sick smile the thug tosses bond into a corner of the room
hes having fun
thug tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at bond
bond shoves a suit of armor on wheels at thug who bats it out of the way like a gnat
concerned this might be getting serious bond grabs an oak leg from the shattered table
he wields it like a bat to ward off the thug
unimpressed the thug smashes his fist into a glass display table and plucks out a claymore a two handed king arthur type sword
with one roundhouse blow thug slices bonds table leg in two
the thug swings the claymore a second time forcing bond back to filled with pole weapons
bond snatches a lethal looking halberd
ax fluke and spike on a staff
thug stops in his tracks
drops the claymore
grabs a pole ax
the two men face off in a short furious battle which ends with thug shattering bonds halberd with the pole ax
gripping the pole ax horizontally in both hands thug forces bond backward to a second display wall that features an iron maiden
something like a hinged sarcophagus lined with spikes
thug tries to push into the case but bond side steps at the last minute
thug lurches forward and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden
as thug steps back bond grabs a morning star from the wall
a studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club bond swings the morning star down snapping thug s pole ax in two
but loses the weapon in the process
now thug lunges for bonds throat
grappling they slam into the wall next to the iron maiden which is starting to come loose from the leather straps holding it upright
in a near death grip bond manages to push kick smash thug backwards down onto the floor
and at the very last second bond dislodges the hand ax slashes the iron maidens leather retaining straps and the iron maiden falls forward impaling thug on the wooden floor
the iron maiden covers all of thug except for his arm still clutching bonds gun
bond bends down and retrieves it
he fought hard
holstering the gun but the case was terminal
and on this note we under a beautiful blue sky the gleaming white sea dolphin ii sits at dock festooned with pennants and banners
theres a crowd onboard
at the same time however feet away
bond meets with signore digiacomo a middle aged italian intelligence official in shirtsleeves
two underlings hover in the background
youve confirmed all the legal details with m
for a woman
lets go over this one more time
digiacomo you will investigate the boat
youll signal us if you find the enriched uranium
and then distracted pardon
he looks at a woman who has appeared with a baby in her arms
i just want to say were voting for you in the election
digiacomo teasing re the baby both of you
laughs of course
digiacomo grazie grazie
he turns back bond digiacomo so
youll signal us if you find the uranium and youll wait until after the press conference and everyone is gone before you board the boat and arrest him
then we turn him over to you and the english government puts him on a military transport back to london
bond nods looks over at the sea dolphin ii
digiacomo do not worry my friend
i only want what is best
for both of us
bond stands to leave
digiacomo smiles after as if hes savoring some private secret
he snaps his fingers to an underling digiacomo rocco
as bond makes his way up the gangplank elliot harmsway is holding a press conference near the bow surround ed by dignitaries
he is a man with an evil euphoria showing off all the charm and charisma thats made him one of the worlds most powerful media tycoons
and so its somewhat fitting that we are here today
to christen this environmental research boat in venice venezia the port where marco polo sailed forth to explore the worlds great uncharted oceans
beat that of the earths surface where the sharks are not working members of the press
bond studies the man
harmsway continues pointing to a large drill boring object the size of a jet engine attached to a long flexible hose tube
with our six custom designed sea bed coring drills we will probe the long term effects of pollution our sonars radars and research labs will study the wind the water
and the sea life that so dearly feeds us
bond moves through the crowd
he spots a bulkhead with a door
and so in the spirit of international cooperation thanking my good friend valentin zukofsky the newly elected president of the ukraine for all his assistance he motions to zukofsky who
nods to the audience
i give this boat to mankind selflessly in pure charity asking nothing for myself
but the cable tv rights
big laugh from the assemblage
harmsway turns to a beauty queen miss venice
if youll do the honors smash
she cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow
now ill take some questions from the press even the few of you who arent on my payroll
harmsway points to a reporter mr
harmsway why did you name this boat the sea dolphin ii
actually my first choice was no comment
so if someone asked where i was i could truthfully respond no comment
laughter he points over there
sir elliot is it true youre in negotiations to move your offices from hong kong to kuala lumpur
impishly no comment
amidst more laughter bond disappears into the bulkhead door
bond moves cautiously down a staircase
and peers along a corridor
he sees a guard checking doors making sure theyre locked
bond withdraws for a moment looks back the guard is at the far end of the hall
he lifts a walkie talkie level one secure
the guard exits down another staircase
bond moves stealthily down the corridor glancing at signs on various doors fish hatchery weather station crews mess etc
until he comes to metallurgy lab
theres a card reader by the door
bond slips out his q toy swipes it
he goes inside
bond clocks the lab power tools test benches a second entry door
and in the middle of the room quickly as the echoes of harmsways press conference can be heard through the portholes bond examines the edges of the box looking for
tamper proof seals
gingerly he opens it uranium slugs
they look like black tennis ball canisters
bond presses a button on his watch the geiger counter clicks wildly bond pauses
wants to make sure
he spots another geiger counter on a bench he moves its probe over the uranium slugs same result
bond closes the box
he decides to check out the rest of the room examining gadgets tools chemicals
he opens a shallow drawer and finds a set of black rotary cutting saws with elongated teeth
they look almost like a series of sharks jaws one oval set inside another bond lifts one surprised at its extreme weight
he wonders what it is used for
just then theres a click at the second door
bond quickly replaces the cutting saw moves to the first door and as the second door opens bond slips out the first into the corridor down the hall heading for
yung enters his hairless head shining under the lights
he looks around sensing something is wrong
glances not the red box
not the geiger counter
but then he notices it the drawer is sticking out maybe a sixteenth of an inch
yung picks up a telephone
bond emerges from the bulkhead door
the press conference wrapping up
as bond makes his way to the rail looking out on the cafe the maiden voyage begins tonight
i have some business in london but the ship will sail down the nile across the south china sea stopping in australia winding up in san francisco
bond stands at the rail aims his watch at the cafe harmsway contd but having said that lets get to the real business the only thing that attracts newsmen faster
than a breaking story the free food and beverage
digiacomo sees the blue laser
motions his men to action
bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible
a hand clasps his shoulder mr
bond spins to see valentin surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons
what an unpleasant surprise
what is it that brings you to venezia mr
business sly glance to the thugs or somebody elses business
the goons chortle
bond isnt happy with this attention
he clocks a video surveillance camera on one of the masts scanning the deck
a womans shrill whining voice brings bond back to valentin
she is very colorfully dressed dripping in high ticket logos
you promised i could go shopping
sotto to bond new mistress
to her impatiently so
i need money
valentin gives a beleaguered shrug and pulls out a huge wad of cash
take an inch
shaking his head valentin turns back to bond come
let me buy you a drink
with bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera they move several steps to the bar
to the bartender two vodka martinis
to bond and you
bond would rather not drink but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion
as the bartender pours i must say valentin capitalism seems to be treating you well
belting one back i used to sell weapons now i buy votes
then off the record
if you cant beat the government you might as well own it
valentin spots someone off camera
wait i want you to meet a friend of mine
calling out elliot
ebullient as ever
elliot harmsway i want to introduce you to an old friend putting out a hand to shake the name is bond
harmsway greets bond with a warm smile
yet his words are ambiguous always nice to meet one of her majestys fellow subjects
a nod to valentin especially one with such distinguished friends
you might say ive always been one of mr
valentins biggest followers
chortling biggest followers
hes practically made a career of it
bond decides to pull harmsways chain
its a beautiful boat sir elliot
practically glows in the dark
smiles i can tell youre a man with an eye for exquisite possessions mr
signaling off camera darling
beat i want you to meet my wife
a woman appears in frame her face obscured by a large sun hat
as she reveals her face to the camera and bond paris harmsway allow me to introduce you to james bond
there is a terrified look on her face
harmsway continues beaming his most insinuating smile but then
i believe you two have already met
there is a beat an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks
then the entire party turns to see digiacomo barging his way up the gangplank wearing a ludicrous military uniform trailed by uzi toting carbinieri along with his own video and
digiacomo elliot harmsway under the auspices of the italian government i franco digiacomo pauses smiles at a camera pop
a flash goes off am arresting you for the illegal possession of weapons grade enriched uranium
to his underlings seize the boat
a set of frozen glances goes from bond to paris to harmsway
i think i suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in moscow
to everyones surprise harmsway guffaws
my friends theres been a terrible mistake
putting his arm around digiacomo come
let me show you
and he leads the procession off through the bulkhead door
bond is left with paris
she is white with fear
bond moves to console her paris leave me alone
hes going to kill me
why didnt you tell me
why wasnt it in our files
anguished he didnt want anyone to know
he kept it out of the papers
he said a third wife was bad for his image
beat youve got to protect me
bond wants to help her and follow harmsway
he pulls out a key go to my hotel room
ill be there in twenty minutes
paris looks up at him like a hurt child
she wants some contact she wants to hear him say i love you
just say it
say it just once
pauses discomfited one thing at a time
ill see you in twenty minutes
she exits he goes to the bulkhead door
and we pan up to see the surveillance camera following him
harmsway holds court near the red box
bond squeezes in
i believe this is what youre looking for colonel
he opens the red box
hoists out a canister
is it uranium
but watch runs the geiger counter over it its depleted uranium
a child could sleep on it
bond cant believe what hes seeing
digiacomo is mortified
i received it from the russian government a by product of their nuclear arms program in the hopes that i could create tools for oceanographic research
beat its what i was talking about swords into plowshares
the sprit of international cooperation
digiacomo signore harmsway
a thousand apologies
snaps his fingers to a lackey give him the video tape
no harm done don franco
go upstairs and enjoy the reception
as the room empties he calls oh mr
bond approaches him
theyre the only people in the room
i hope youve enjoyed this little charade
icily a piece of advice mr
bond dont screw with a man who buys ink by the ton
beat its deadlier than uranium
staring him down well see about that
harmsway glances at his watch
arent you late for a meeting
bond rushes down the gangplank along the dock
jumps in a gondola
harmsway closes the door
yung is there
that was too close
bond will get the message
so will his boss
harmsway presses a button and suddenly the red box lifts and a second red box appears underneath it like shuffling a deck of cards
im going to the plane
tell the captain to set sail at once
bond jumps out of the gondola sprints into the lobby
bond appears rushing up a staircase
he comes to his doorway
its closed but unlocked
bond enters the room
looks around calling out paris
he sees the french doors open onto the canal
the curtains billowing outward
bond rushes to the window and looks down paris harmsway is dead floating in the water
and to make matters worse digiacomos voice signore bond
a flashbulb goes off capturing bond and digiacomo
digiacomo youre under arrest
the hms indomitable a ton british frigate surges through the water heading toward the setting sun
battle dressed royal marines patrol the deck gunnery crews man the weapons
whatever is going on here its not business as usual
close on a vertical glass map
an electronic panel display with a blinking yellow dot indicates weve cleared hong kong harbor sir
the captain nods
turns to the gps officer position
the gps officer enters keyboard commands on console marked global positioning satellite
he reads out the data two two zed three one five north a hundred fourteen degrees five minutes ten seconds east
locked on satellite sir
set course two ten degrees south south east

the captain is all business clipped sober terse
turns to his first officer hands him a slip of paper orders from london for the next ninety six hours were to run on full radio silence
double watches full alert
beat were to send one encrypted positioning burst to london every six hours otherwise zero electronic emissions
the first officer nods
captain contd inform the men then run a surprise inspection
if someone paints us i dont want this ship showing up on their radar screen like some god damned harrods christmas tree
ill be in my cabin until oh six hundred hours
the captain heads for the door
captain leaving the bridge
the officers salute as he exits
with a shrug the first officer picks up the intercom microphone attention all hands
now hear this
crowded with crew members eating waiting on line for food
we will rig immediately for electronic silence
all electronic gear is to be shut down
his finger hovers over button then stops
he opens the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl
dumps the contents on the stove
crew member with an electric shaver
all personal radios video devices and computers will be stowed at once
he stops shaving
the engineer shouts to his crew over noise of diesel engines check the engine baffles rig the generators for shielded operation
the first officer stands next to the communications officer
communications set to receive only sir
the first officer looks over the shoulder of rating at radar screen
radar switched to passive mode sonar re set to low power operation
beat you couldnt find our signature with a magnifying glass
lets hope so
the first officer joins the second officer at the windows scanning the horizon with binoculars
looks like were in for a long uncomfortable trip
well all breathe a lot easier when we get this cargo back to london
the bagpipe and drum corps of the royal highland regiment aka the black watch is playing a funeral dirge outside a vast stone house with a harmsway news helicopter on
the lawn and limousines a hearse and a flower car in the driveway
six men in formal mourning attire are entering the house
a single white rose is added to a pile of white roses in paris reveal were in mid procession the last two of the six men from outside place roses
in the casket
then turn nodding sorrowfully to elliot harmsway sitting in the front row of a room thats keen turned into a makeshift chapel
and follow hand signals of stamper who motions them through a door to an unseen room
after the last man has paid his respects harmsway stands walks to the bier and wiping away a tear places a single red rose in his dead wifes casket
were in a room that looks as if it could only exist in well a james bond movie slick stark sterile
steel glass chrome
the six men are seated around a giant conference table looking absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire
elliot harmsway enters passing what appears to be the liechtenstein that hangs in the lobby of caa walks to the head of the table takes off his gray mourning gloves
slaps them down and good morning gentlemen
im sorry to bring you here under these circumstances but beat considering our meeting was already scheduled this was a happy coincidence
the men nod
harmsway sits dims the lights from a control panel
harmsway contd number one your report
a gap toothed californian with bland features stands
sir elliot the entertainment division is releasing three new animated childrens movies this year
pause by the time were finished promoting them on our tv radio cable newspaper and magazine outlets pause there wont be a parent in the universe who wont feel guilty
if they dont take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys books video games and clothing featuring our lovable little creatures
pause we anticipate revenues of
excellent number one
build a better rat trap and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park
turns to number two
a young guy with glasses gets up looking remarkably like bill gates
as youre aware sir elliot our software division has introduced a new computer operating system gates
beat its deliberately filled with bugs so people will be forced to buy our upgrades over the next five years
beat the window on revenues is
outstanding number two
beat remembering by the way number five
a man looks up whos ahead in the american elections
the democrat sir
by nine points
maybe its time to publish that story about his sex life
even things up
a close race is always better for our tv ratings
consider him slimed sir
with noticeable reserve number three
a short middle eastern man stands
i regret to inform you sir that saddam hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the gulf war
havent we already paid him for his services
but he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division
he has proposed an additional million dollar payment
the other men in the room shift uncomfortably
and theres no truth that of that money will go into your swiss bank account
this is not true
you disappoint me number three
harmsway presses a button
number three assumes this means death
he begs for his life please sir
please but because i am a just man ive decided to give mr
hussein what he deserves
number three is confused
does this mean hes going to live
stamper will escort you to the plane
overwhelmed with gratitude thank you sir
harmsway nods watching him leave good bye mr
and the man is gone
harmsway turns his attention back to the room lets proceed with new business
harmsway presses another button
the room darkens
the center of the table opens and a d map of malaysia rises into view
gentlemen in exactly hours we are going to initiate phase one of the words most perfect crime the biggest theft in the history of mankind
beat pointing with a laser right here
in the strait of malacca
stamper holds the back door open for number three
he gets in
he seems relieved until the doors lock ominously
they drive off
number three fidgets in the back
and notices stamper smiling at him in the rearview mirror
he sees stamper reach into his jacket and panics
is he going to get shot
is it over
he winces as gum
shaking his head he pulls out a handkerchief to mop the flop sweat
amidst ad libbed good byes from the gang of six now five harmsway gets in the waiting hnn chopper
it powers up takes off
stampers limousine parks near a gulfstream jet
he opens the back door for number three
at last the man believes he is safe
thank you so much
you must thank sir elliot for me
producing a newspaper here
something to read on the plane
stamper tucks the paper firmly under s arm and gives him a friendly pat on the back sending him up the stairs
at the doorway number three looks back
stamper smiles waving bye bye
number three settles into his seat
the door closes the engines wind up for take off
he sighs hes safe
he casually picks up the newspaper snaps open the front page screaming headline israeli agent revealed
theres a full color photo of number three underneath
number three lowers the paper white as a ghost and two arabian gentlemen in full burnoose sit down on either side of him
and on number threes blood curdling scream we moving through fog in the strait of malacca night
the room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the indomita bles command and control systems
at the vertical glass map the ships course has been charted from hong kong south down around singapore then north where the yellow blinking dot indicates its currently in the
strait of malacca
standing in front of the map however the navigation officer seems perplexed
hes comparing whats on the screen to a piece of paper in his hand
something is wrong
this doesnt make sense
whats our heading now
the helmsman looks down at his compass auto pilot
insert compass auto pilot moving from west to north then holding on a north position
zero one three
the two officers share a look
something is odd but were on course again
just then the first officer enters from the exterior bridge
cant see a damn thing in this fog
calling out rating what have we got
he joins the rating and communications officers at their scopes
a passenger ferry and two freighters broadcasting on low band and two small fishing boats about k north
no radar but weve identified their engine signatures
as the first officer takes this in damn
its doing it again
joining him whats wrong
about every ninety seconds the auto pilot jogs us to the west
he points down to the compass auto pilot swinging west
then re sets us to the north
the compass reaches dead west then starts to swing back north
helmsman contd the captain wants us on the east side of the channel
not in the strait
to the navigator hows our position
according to the satellite were exactly on course
did you check the auto pilot
the back up does the same thing
check it again
what about the global positioning satellite
could there be something wrong with the signal
two words im possible
as the earth turns below a tiny silver dot appears in the distance a communications satellite spinning slowly on its axis
it comes closer and closer to camera until it fills the screen and the logo on its body rotates into view the helmsman finishes fiddling with the auto pilot
how is it now
seems to be back to normal sir
the first officer nods
then hears a shrill warning beep
i have something off the port bow
the first officer rushes to join him at the screen
sonar operator contd meters out just below the surface
adjusts the controls a meter in diameter ten twelve meters long
a dead head
off the others quizzical looks water logged timber
floats straight up
you sometimes see them on the east side of the channel from the logging camps on sumatra but they dont usually float this far west
calling out muncy
engines to half
aye aye sir
engines to half
explaining chew up a log like that in the propeller you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to london
the ship is moving towards a dark vertical shape harmsways sea bed core boring drill shorthand the worm attached to a long flexible dredging pipe
motionless hanging in the water
then the monster awakes a metal sphere retracts revealing a wide angle camera lens
the communications officer reacts to his monitor with alarm im getting an electrical emission sir
bearing the first officer is surprised
all hell is about to break loose punch up the radar ive got it sir
a large craft xx ooo tons
range disbelief yards
its anchored in a cove
were in the middle of the channel
a junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge breakers off the port bow
were heading for shore
sir reacting to the jr
officer full stop
call the captain
the log is moving
propelled by water jets in its head the worm streaks toward the indomitable emitting a high pitched whine as its drill bit revs up to speed
the drills black teeth glisten in the water
closing in on the hull like a torpedo
it gets closer picking up speed until on impact a torrent of water engulfs the engineer and crewmen when the worm bursts drills through the hull
as they scream drowning a crewman on the gantry scrambles up one step ahead of the water through a bulkhead into where the crewman and two operators struggle to close
the door on the intercom weve been hit
were taking water
red lights flash
flooding in the engine room
get me damage reports
start the pumps
holding out a ships phone its the captain on a phone outside the ships gym deep in the hull what the hell is going on
intercut if necessary i think weve been holed sir
on my way
he speeds along the passageway going through a water tight door slamming it behind him
meanwhile on the engines are gone
flooding on d deck
sound the general alarm
seal all compartments
as the second officer grabs the intercom second officer into intercom attention all hands the crew members look up from their meals second officer continuing proceed to emergency stations the
men have closed the door but
hear a high pitched whining grinding sound from the other side
they exchange a quizzical look they dont know what to make of it when bang
the door explodes inward and a high pressured stream of water blasts in blowing them back against the walls
the lights go out
everyone is scrambling weve lost power
go to back up generators
second officer into intercom repeat seal all compartments and in the dim lighting second officer on intercom proceed to emergency stations at once
the men start to move but halt at a humming sound
they look around where is it coming from
suddenly a three foot section of the deck explodes in a fountain of water
the men are swept off their feet
as the captain rushes up the steps he turns around reacting to a boom
water blasts through like fire hydrants turned on full
with terror in his eyes the captain sprints up the rest of the stairs through a water tight door into where the captain secures the door behind him and rushes
a desperate battle continues flooding on c deck
where the hell are those generators
coming up sir
get those pumps working
a crewman hurriedly flips switches
the lights flicker
and just as they some to life brightly the door bursts open and a wall of water and debris blows in destroying everything in its wake
a sense of helplessness is beginning to fill the room the back up is gone
flooding up to b deck
we cant hold out much longer sir
all eyes are on the first officer
will he save them
where the hell is the captain
running the captain is about to reach the exit door
hearing the relentless grinding behind him he throws a look over his shoulder bam
the entrance door explodes in a thunderball of water
the captain clambers through the exit door to a short hall he shuts the entrance door runs to the exit
he looks hack again bam
the door blasts open and the torrent of water continues the chase as if its got a personal vendetta against him
he exits to slamming the door behind him the captain looks ahead and up he throws a look back sprinting for his life the captain rushes up the stairs two
at a time
the humming behind him grows louder
he glances back he rushes up the last four steps just as with panic in his eyes the captain turns to face the oncoming tsunami
we cut to moving like a shark
toward the captains legs dead ahead in the water
as it closes in for the kill shifts suddenly to the stern
a confusion of anxious voices slipping to stern
all major compartments flooded
with all hands still awaiting orders the room lurches as the bow rises
the first officer has no choice abandon ship
break radio silence
send our position
the communications officer types top secret
indian ocean naval command
calling out whats our position
reading off his screen one hundred degrees thirty one minutes and seven seconds east by two degrees twenty nine minutes ten seconds north
as he types the room lurches again tilting more to the stern
as the passageway shifts tilting to the stern the captain screams and whoosh
is sucked down into the water the worms vortex like meat being fed into a cuisinart a churning spinning death
bow rises completely out of the water as the stern goes under
two crewman manage to get a lifeboat away
two others scramble up from below and leap into the water
the bow is at a forty five degree angle
and the h
indomitable pauses for just a moment before slipping under stern first throwing up a series of great waves
rocked by waves from the sinking ship
the cook a marine and three crewmen hear a splash along side
two of the crew pull the sonar officer aboard
he takes a minute to catch his breath then six
only six of us
most of the crew never made it to their life jackets
shrugs then the first officer stayed on the bridge
one of the crewman spots something in the distance hey look
the sea dolphin ii emerges from a cove looking like a ghostly white apparition in the fog
the men yell and wave and whistle hoping to be saved
elliot harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face
turns to yung standing next to him at the rail lovely night for a shipwreck isnt it
yung looks at harmsway like hes crazy
oblivious harmsway looks at his watch then looks through the binoculars again and begins to whistle the opening notes of my fair ladys wouldnt it be loverly
all i want is a room somewhere far away from the cold night air as the men cry for help the sonar operator spots something just below the surface moving
toward the lifeboat at great speed
he hears the hum
his eyes follow the churning water
and suddenly out of nowhere the worm hits the lifeboat from below smashing it to bits hurtling the pieces in the air
harmsway lowers the binoculars smiling
stamper appears hands harmsway a piece of paper
weve decoded their last transmission
harmsway studies it for a moment smiles
theyll be searching miles from here
then time for phase two
you can get the men in the water
and with this harmsway turns and walks off jauntily whistling wouldnt it be loverly
stamper looks at yung re harmsways glee
you heard him
get the men in the water
in the water next to the chip four divers drop the last of their equipment in a dive boat
they cast off motoring into the fog
the classic michelin building on fulham road
a young woman is yammering away at bond hes trying to put a good face on what is obviously a dreadful fix up first date
i cant believe it took us so long to finally get together
what exactly do you do for the government
after a beat you might say
i bet you meet all the most fabulous people
before bond can answer the maitre d interrupts
excuse me mr
you have a call
bond excuses himself
picks up the receiver without saying hello moneypenny
you werent supposed to call until he stiffens yes
passing a newspaper delivery truck with an ad for tomorrow the paper that never lies bonds db roars past the guard
admiral roebuck glares as minister johnstone enters to address m tanner a treasury official and various uniforms and suits
ive just spoken with the prime minister at the economic summit in tokyo hes expecting a full update within the hour
beat for those of you still unaware some forty minutes ago interrupting excuse me but all turn to him i must formally protest this meeting
given the nature of whats occurred and the need for secrecy i see no reason to involve the air force the army or mi
beat as m and tanner exchange a look this is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her majestys royal navy
furious admiral are you suggesting hes distracted by the click of a door opening
all turn to see bond entering wearing a full naval uniform
m stifles a smile
sorry im late actually youre just in time
she turns to admiral roebuck you know commander bond dont you
ive looked forward to meeting you
m glances at johnstone as if to say proceed
as i was saying approximately forty five minutes ago we received an abandon ship signal from the h
flicks on a map display looking at these infrared satellite images provided by mr
tanner of mi the ship is presumed lost here just south of kuala lumpur where she broadcast her last position
foreground empty diving boat
background sea dolphin ii with the flexible hose hanging over the rail down into the water
stamper works worm master control with a video joystick
divers approaching the hull
harmsway and yung look over his shoulder at through the worms underwater camera four divers with torches and welding tools are about to enter the hole in the indomitables hull
the video screen also contains lots of digital information about the divers and the worms functions
the worm follows the divers into the hull
it trails the divers past debris and bodies of crewman
into microphone to the right towards the stern
the divers react and the worm follows them into
the divers and worm travel to a hatch covered with metal bars
lighting the welding torches they try to cut through the metal bars
one of the divers turns to the worms camera
he speaks into his diving helmets microphone through speaker its titanium
we cant cut through
stamper turns to harmsway ill do it
harmsway into microphone divers stand aside
the worm moves into position to grind through the hatch
a protective cover slides over the lens and the grinder whorls into life
closer on the worm the grinder stalls for an instant as it encounters the titanium bars
still closer one of the uranium grinding teeth snaps off as it hits the titanium and starts to grind through
once past the bars the grinder cuts easily through the steel door
trapped air bursts out from inside the compartment
the divers push the worm to one side two of them enter the hold with lights
the worm follows
the two other divers remain behind to feed the worms flexible tubing through the door
the divers lights illuminate the hold stacks of gold bars as far as the eye can see
harmsway looks at the video screen
gentlemen i do believe weve struck gold
four minutes ahead of schedule
the worm closes its eye revs up its grinders and attacks the first pile of gold bars
it runs through them like butter
the bloodletting and recriminations have begun
this plays fast incredulous one third of the british gold reserves
beat what kind of idiot loses looks to the treasury officer what is it
the equivalent of ten billion us dollars
sheepishly give or take
depending on todays currency rates ignoring him what the hell was the gold doing on that boat
we were bringing it back from hong kong
under orders from the treasury
during the cold war we stored a third in america and another third in hong kong in case of a nuclear attack
and with the turn over of hong kong to the chinese why wasnt the ship protected
why was it sailing without radar
i resent your tone sir
i have men who are missing and i have the entire british economy to worry about
breaking in minister all turn to him obviously mi was not involved in this operation
but i have to defend the admiral
roebuck looks at bond with great surprise
bond continues bond contd electronic silence was the safest way to move that gold
otherwise any country or individual with the crudest missile could just lock onto our signals and take out the boat
beat thats what happened to the sheffield in the falklands
beat since then its standard operating procedure for any sensitive shipment
frowns at least we know where the gold is
when are the recovery ships due
theyve already sailed from the persian gulf
i expect to have that gold recovered in hours
until then im imposing my own electronic silence for the sake of the economy not a word to nato the press the cia
beat looking at and so long as commander bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters i want him to go along as an observer
are we agreed
as you wish
harmsway walks along the side of the ship observing the operation the worms dredging pump sucks up the ground up gold and water slur ry through the tube hanging over
the side and dumps it into a series of sluices
at each stage the gold nuggets fall to the bottom of the sluice and excess water flows off the side of the ship
where all the water has been drained off leaving a cascade of gold nuggets pouring into the ships hold harmsway reaches into the shimmering cascade and takes a hand full
he sees stamper approaching
remember the golden rule mr
stamper he who has the gold rules
he drops the gold back in the hold
is the helicopter ready
fueled and waiting
we have an appointment in hong kong
m and bond striding down a hallway to exit the building
youre turning into quite the politician
i have an excellent teacher
sideways glance make sure you wear the uniform
ignoring his jibe what do you make of all this
it doesnt quite add up
theyve come to a door
pause as he opens it
he explains the infrared satellite images
no heat no flame no explosion
if that boat went down where they said it did there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface
a three thousand ton frigate doesnt just vanish into thin air
she nods and pushes through the door
ive already contacted our station in kuala lumpur
theyre lining up a local contact
beat i want you to find that gold and secure it
theyve arrived at her car
the door is already open
didnt elliot harmsway just move his headquarters to kuala lumpur
she turns freezes bond with a look contrary to what you may believe the world is not filled with mad men who can hollow out volcanoes stock them with big
breasted women and threaten the world with nuclear annihilation
bond reacts to the comeuppance
she continues m contd the case is closed
the italian authorities ruled the girl a suicide
we had enough trouble keeping your name out of the media
for everyones sake beat your job is to find the gold
not settle some personal score with elliot harmsway
super hong kong
harmsways helicopter is perched atop the famous tinker toy styled building in the central district
a chinese chop comes down firmly on a legal document
general li of the peoples revolutionary army is seated with a squad of lawyers and that is the fifth document
with your counter signature the sale will be complete
the document is passed across to harmsway sitting with his own legal counsel
one of the men is whispering to him intensely are you sure
if we waited harmsway waves the lawyer off silencing him
addresses the general general li my young associate here has just informed me that if i waited a year i could perhaps receive a higher price for this building
beat wryly he has great faith in hong kong
as did my ancestors
with obvious results
nervous chuckles around the table but the general is reserved
harmsway contd yet to sell this building for more money to profiteer would run counter to the chinese sprit of guanchi mutual trust and obligation it would violate the ancient
principles of feng shui beat the reason we sign five documents instead of an unlucky four and why this building has a fifth non functioning ventilation shaft on its roof
beat wind and water fire and rain earth and sky feng shui
all things at one in balance with nature
most eloquently put sir elliot
thank you general li
now ill just sign this last document he puts the pen to the paper and breaks the pen
harmsway contd terribly sorry
from behind stamper hands him a pen
harmsway innocently starts to sign in red ink sir elliot
red ink of course
more bad luck
ill just borrow yours he takes general lis pen and signs his name with a flourish
under the whirring blades of the chopper harmsway bids farewell to general li
he and stamper get in helicopter
as harmsway waves good bye from the window the helicopter rises revealing a metal cable attached to the landing skid
the cable leads to a spool which runs to the fifth metal ventilation shaft harmsway referred to in the last scene
harmsway pops open a bottle of champagne
an old chinese toast to our friends
the general sees the cable grow taut around the ventilation shaft
he reacts with horror
harmsway glances down to watch the ventilation shaft topple onto the general and his aides scattering them like rats
in the chopper the pilot cuts the cable and harmsway lifts a champagne glass confusion to the enemy
in hours that building and all of hong kong around it will cease to exist
a british military c airship is dropping sono buoys into the water from a low altitude
me plane veers off revealing a british sea king command and control helicopter hovering above
bond holds a map of the channel
hes standing over several crewman seated at radar sonar and navigation consoles
sounding bottom is thirty fathoms
we should be right over it
they hear a sharp dinging sound wait im getting something
what is it
the man points at one of the screens where bond sees a computer generated map of the sea floor with the faint outline of a warship
not sure yet he types in some commands on a keyboard and a d rendering of a boat appears on another computer screen
lots of data the shinjuku
japanese troop carrier
world war ii
lets make another pass
calling out we have traffic on the deck they look down and see an hnn harmsway news network boat
get rid of them
the chopper hovers above the hnn boat pilot on pa speaker please leave the area
please leave the area
were looking up at the worlds tallest building the twin petronas towers
they look like an architectural collaboration between friz lang and h
at the th floor theres a sky bridge connecting the buildings where elliot harmsway strides out of an elevator in tower into a group of waiting assistants
without breaking stride good morning sir elliot
welcome to kuala lumpur morning morning all
what have we got
his executive secretary rushes to keep up reading from a pad as they cross the sky bridge to hnns main reception area in tower the canadian prime minister wants to
set a lunch pencil it in for the next trip the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story send him a campaign contribution and explain i have no control over what my journalists write your bankers want an answer about the brazilian tv stations no the queen invited you to dinner yes and the news meeting is waiting
theyve passed from the bridge through reception into a glass conference roam whose partially closed blinds obscure the view of the mammoth hnn news center
well see this in full later
meanwhile a dozen rambunctious editors react to morning all my golden retrievers
what kind of havoc shall we create in the world today
a ferry sank and burned in pakistan dead
american jetliner down in omaha better
economic summit ends in tokyo boring riots broke out at the world cup soccer finals dog bites man
explains man bites dog is a news story
riots at the world cup soccer finals is a social announcement
this just came in theres something up with the british navy in the strait
rescue planes helicopters two ships supposedly sailing from the persian gulf
they just chased away one of our news boats
feigning complete innocence is that so
sounds like a plane went down or something
either way theyre calling it all together now a routine training exercise
issue the usual vehement protest freedom of the press peoples right to know
lather it up with a lot of righteous indignation
off their laughter next
frowning bond peers at the sonar operators screen
the operator shakes his head
the pilot calls back from the cockpit commander bond theyve found one of the crewmans bodies
the sea king comes in above several police cars and boats
bond jumps the last ten feet and the chopper peels off
bond turns to look its jack wade
wade what the hell are you doing here
i am not here ol buddy
the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship the missing gold where it was going or when it left hong kong
hey the world is my office
lets take a look at the body
as bond moves off wade sniffs the air savoring the aroma smells like
a policemen pulls a white sheet from the body
we dont see it
bond and wade look down at something gruesome colorful
bond shakes his head grimly
i dont think so
the veins are cauterized as if they were sealed by heat
beat confounded but there are no burn marks on the flesh
it doesnt make sense
to the policeman who found the body
points to dato
says it came in with the tide early this morning
ask him if it could have washed in from the west side of the strait
the policeman has an animated conversation with fisherman
he says its not possible
the current could have only brought the body in from the east
to wade you have a boat
i dont know if youd call it a boat
something with an engine
step into my office
smashing through the water at breakneck speed
wade and bond yell over the engines
what do you want with the harbor master
tide and current charts
work backward from the body find where the ship sank
wade nods appreciatively where did you get the boat
seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of bangkok
beat should have seen his rose garden blooms the size of hand grenades
bond looks at wade the man remains forever deranged
the harbor masters tower overlooks a small armada of yachts fishing boats etc
a series of long dockways jut out into the harbor
wades boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the docks
looking off bond spots the harbor masters tower over there
wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels
a sleek launch is roaring towards them on a dead collision course
a woman in a baseball cap is at the wheel
wade pulls his boat to the right the launch roars around them rocking the cigarette boat with its wake
both bond and wade clock the woman who we will later learn is sidney winch
wade stares after her i think ive just seen my next future ex wife
seeing theyre about to crash not if you kill us first unless thats how you plan to leave muffy
wade scowls setting the boat back on course
bond hops off the boat securing the lines
wade joins him
by the way jimbo whatever happened to that girl in cuba
finished tying the boat they walk toward the harbor masters office
russian minister of transportation
she married a hockey player
i envy your undercover assignments
a look then we work in the dark
we do what we can
the local malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter
wind tide currents
youre the second person today asked for a full set of charts
holds out a clipboard if youd just sign here bond takes the clipboard insert clipboard read signature sidney winch
bond returns the clipboard thanks
apparent afterthought by the way was there anything strange the night before last
odd weather lost boats
unless youre talking about the bus problem
captain cheongs ferry was late
he runs the line across the strait between here and sumatra
the lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus
slept on the docks
hundreds of them
bond emerges carrying the charts along with wade
i have to get these to london
do you know this captain cheong
spends his nights at the kuala lumpur yacht club
can you arrange a meeting
the cia built that club
palm trees torch lights and rolls royces
a local band plays on the verandah
we find wade at a poker table with five local malay chinese
he cuts the cards exuberantly okay gentlemen
the name of the game is card cambodian stud
everything is wild
and then moving through a beaded glass curtain we find bond in a white dinner jacket sitting with captain cheong
the captain is elegant mid os eye patch
to be put into local dialect
in the strait of malacca when a boat is even five minutes late one begins to worry mr
pirates from sumatra want the cargo smugglers from thailand and burma want the ships
sometimes kill the crew other times points to his eye torture them
the kuala lumpur ferry was miles off course that night
captain blamed the auto pilot i suspected he was drunk until the sumatra ferry captain had same problem
did you test the auto pilots
the satellite positioning receiver
chuckles my year old grandfather thinks ghost in the computer silicon dragon
smiles standing to leave i appreciate your time maybe you should talk to sidney winch
owns a marine salvage company
nobody knows more about the strait
where can i find him
he is a she points at the bar
sidney winch about tough smart and heres a surprise beautiful is ordering a drink when bond appears bourbon
i wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat
very slowly sidney turns to bond
she looks him up and down as if deciding whether this specimen is worth her time
her conclusion a definite though skeptical maybe
she gives him a sultry smile sometimes you just have to plunge into things
and i bet you always leave turmoil in your wake
thinking not bad have we met
our boats practically kissed in the harbor
holds out his hand to shake james bond
the bartender appears
vodka martini shaken not stirred
to sidney and another for you
but you can buy a drink for my friend taro
she steps back revealing a huge samoan taro wearing a dark suit and tie sitting on a stool
taro smiles menacingly at bond
im waiting for my dinner date
to bartender bring him whatever he wants
so what brings you to kuala lumpur mr
beat wait dont tell me unhappy marriage
running from some poor little girl with two kids and a chanel pocketbook in london
bond analyzes the situation shes with a thug
shes in marine salvage
she went to the harbor masters office for the charts
shes a smart ass
he decides to see if he can rattle her actually im here on business
you might say it was a
a chill in her voice and exactly what business are you in mr
lloyds of london
daggers in her voice the strait can be a very dangerous place mr
a few words scribbled on a piece of paper in london doesnt carry a lot of value out here
including life insurance
ill keep that in mind
looking off i see my date is here
to taro and i think mr
bond is ready to leave
nice to run into you again
lets not make it a habit
turning his back on taro bond watches her cross the room
taro places a huge hand on bonds shoulder i think you should go not quite yet taro and from bonds pov sidney greets harmsway with a big hug
watching this bond seethes with memory of paris and his hatred of harmsway
taro tightens his grip i said you should but before he finishes bond spins and slams taros head on the bar snatches the ice pick from the bartender yanks taro
back ward by his collar slams the ice pick through taros tie into the wooden bar and kicks the stool out from under the goon
taro is now hanging by his tie from the bar choking
bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow tie
wade appears jubilant with a wad of cash yo
i won five hundred seeing taro what happened
he tied one on
bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat moored at the end
bond looks around furtively before climbing aboard the sleek ocean going craft
on the aft deck theres a large covered object
as bond reaches for the cabin door it opens by itself and a succession of three young english women in string bikinis emerge
calling back into the cabin hes arrived
bond turns from the door to watch the women
he hears youre late
ive been expecting you
q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot
hes irritated q
how are you
im not getting paid to help you save the world anymore
it was a national emergency that hardly makes up for the imposition
beat now for what i hope will be the very last time pay attention
he unfurls a map first computer generated retrograde analysis map
body here meteorolog ical influences here likely vector ing of the ships coordinates here
do you have any idea of what any of that means
not a clue
i didnt lose the ship
reaches for a filofax sized device next your new personal communicator
flips it open picture phone fax beeper
taking it do i have to dial to get out
i dont care who you dial so long as its not me
next q walks to the large object on the aft deck
pulls off a tarp your new car
insert name interrupting four wheel drive
and do try to keep all four of them on the road
continuing all the usual refinements smoke missiles machine guns shows him a key fob fully operational remote control
drives forward reverse bond presses a button opening a window stop that
grabbing it away plus infrared thermal imaging radar heads up instrumentation and beverage cup holders
beverage cup holders
the worlds automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders
bond nods and looks at a distraction from the girls in bikinis
i must say q you seem to be doing rather well in your retirement
dont even think about it
theyre my granddaughters
clear skies and blue water
the only vessel in sight is a thirty five foot sport fishing boat underway at full throttle
wade at the helm bond next to him near sonar holding qs map
wade pulls back on the throttle
the boat starts a wide turn and were back at the outcropping where the indomitable sank
the sport fishing boat is trolling against a background of sandy beaches and the lush green hills of sumatra
wade scans the shore bond studies the sonar display
i dunno jimbo
it cant be out here
how could they get this far off course
concentrating on the sonar who knows
theyd never sail this close to the shore
wait a minute beat pointing to the screen ive got it
off the port bow
the murky electronic outline of a ship
bond watches the sonar screen
wade slows engines consults charts
cut the engines
its about two hundred fifty feet down
bond is strapping on his scuba tank
two fiftys pretty deep for air
you should really be using mixed gases
bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks
ill make a bounce dive
if i can keep my bottom time short ill be all right
bond gathers up flares and sits on the gunwale
only half teasing keep your eye out for pirates
wade pulls back his shirt to reveal two six shooters
i got you covered
bond rolls backward into the water and disappears
bond swims to the anchor line and begins pulling himself downward handover hand deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom
bond touches down by the anchor his fins kick up the sandy bottom
checking his wrist compass he sets off through a rocky channel
ahead in the dimness a huge gray shape looms out of the sand
bond lights a flare and the scene is suddenly alive with color
from bonds position the hull seems to go on forever before being lost beyond range of his flare
bond checks his air gauge
depth feet air capacity tank remaining
bond swims to the hole in the side of the indomitable
he pauses to study the damage
bond sees the damage on the passageway door
swims through it
the flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor bond swims to the busted bilge hold hatch
again he pauses to examine the marks made by the worm
he drops into the hold
the gold is gone
bond swims a few yards in nothing
a vast empty space
bonds flare sputters and dies
he drops it lights another
as he turns to exit something glints on the deck below the hatch
he moves toward it
a half chewed gold bar is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead
bond reaches for it feeling the worms drill marks on the gold
just as he yanks the bar out a moray eel lashes out from behind the brace baring its teeth
still clutching the gold bar bond jumps back and shoots up into where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling
dropping the flare on the impact bond twists around to see throwing wildly gyrating shadows the flare drops to the deck roll ing under some debris
regaining his composure bond slips the gold bar into a webbed sack on his belt then moves to retrieve the flare
bond reaches for the flare under a section of the torn hatch cover
he notices the broken uranium grinding tooth
he picks it up stuffs it into his sack and swims off
bond swims to the anchor line grabs hold and starts up
on the way he glances at his gauges depth feet air capacity below red line empty
the ambient light level on the gauges suddenly darkens
a black hull has blotted out the light
and something large and heavy is falling straight at
kicks away from the anchor line just as a pound anchor streaks by
he looks up again one carries a strange looking harpoon type gun another trails a cable
the divers have fanned out looking for
realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage
flashing his knife bond cuts the cord to his gold uranium sack bond rockets up slamming into diver
a confusion of bubbles
and just as bond overcomes the man spinning him around holding the knife to the divers throat diver shoots the harpoon type gun and a dolphin net explodes out enveloping
bond and the diver in a mesh
note this is a real fish friendly research tool
diver hooks the cable hes been trailing onto the net and the net erupts through the surface is hauled up into the air and deposited on an old scow with
a large crane two story deck house and a crew whose idea of cruise wear runs to tattoos and grotesque scars
as the water drains from his mask bond sees the mesh being pulled away and five goons come into focus training automatic weapons on him
bond still has the diver from behind knife to his throat
one of the goons reaches forward ripping off bonds mask
sees brandishing an uzi at bond with a malevolent smile uzi beats knife
bond sticks the knife into the deck and releases the hostage
get him up
take his belt
motioning to wade take the two of them to the captain
the men grab bond roughly and shove him next to wade
by the way
i almost forgot
smashing bond i owed you one
bond and wade are frog marched to the bridge passing under the gaze of various cutthroat crew members
wade is completely unfazed
sniffs the air smell that jimmy
bond gives wade a look
hey it could be worse
at least they speak english
bond glances up at a crew member sharpening a machete smiling
somehow thats not reassuring
were back in bond land a high tech control room with lots of monitors and white suited technicians
bond and wade are pushed through the door followed by taro and the two goons
here they are captain
the captain turns from a monitor its sidney
just give me one goad reason mister bond from lloyds of london why i shouldnt kill both of you burn your boat and use your bodies for shark bait
chirping up so you two know each other
small world aint it
who is he
sidney winch meet jack wade
commercial loan division
if youre ever lookin for a sweet refinance on the boat shut up
to wade you have to excuse miss winch she thinks shes on a seduce and destroy mission through life
pauses but she wont kill us
first because i dont think its in your nature
and second because theres no gold down there
beat dont insult me
im not one of your little london girls who falls for the lies
so it was commitment
every wharf rat from here to hong kong knows whats on that boat and im claiming it
one third of that gold is mine
thats fine but even a little london girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing
theres a flicker of doubt in her eyes
she turns to taro was he carrying anything
taro holds up the bonds diving belt indicating nothing
angrily search him
the men look at bond wearing only swim trunks
do i have to do everything around here
i hope so
frowning sidney moves to bond
as she reaches into his trunks we cut to their faces
their eyes are locked on each other i hope youll be gentle
think about mom
shes goosed him
returning to the wide shot she opens the sack
shows the gold and what do you call this
the family jewels
she scowls takes out the uranium tooth
looks at it blankly and holds it out to a technician who examines it
what is this
i dont know
im not sure just then a crewman bursts in boss
we got company comin up off the starboard bow
exiting to taro bring them
taro motions with his uzi for bond and wade to follow
but bond hesitates looking back at the technician with the uranium
wants to get it but taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle
a british naval cutter is pulling alongside the barge sea siren wailing crew members in battle gear forward gatling gun manned
on bullhorn attention sea barge lay down your weapons and prepare to be boarded
on the barge sidney and co
stand weapons ready
repeat lay down your weapons and prepare to be boarded
bond turns to sidney whos grabbed a bullhorn of her own
if i were you youre not
as she hoists the bullhorn just remember they think theres ten billion dollars in gold down there
clicks it on and now hear this drop dead
bond and wade exchange an amused helpless glance as if they both know whats coming next
theres a pause then its only a warning shot but everyone on the barge dives for the deck
except for bond and wade who might as well be having tea
bond looks down at taro cowering on the boards
gatling gun beats uzi
an armed boarding party is coming across an aluminum bridge that has extended from the cutter onto the barge
a tiny popinjay whos in charge here
what do you want
you have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way
i got here first
ignoring her whos wade
that would be me snidely thanks for your message
turns to and youre bond
arrest these men
escort them to the cutter
bond and wade are stunned
the marines move in
bond struggles wait a minute get them out of here
if he says one word shoot him
as two marines with automatic rifles take bond and wade across the folding bridge demanding whats your name
she expects him to ask and yours
but he doesnt
my name is sidney winch and good for you miss winch
you now have exactly seconds to get this rust bucket out of here
furiously i know my rights
these are international waters
the british navy abandoned that boat and im claiming it
under international law i have the right to salvage whats on that wreck
perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney
i was an attorney
i suppose this is a step above that profession
beat ten seconds
are you leaving
you leave me no alternative
upholstering a walkie talkie cut her anchor
as sidney yells no
the forward gatling gun erupts to life
one short bone rattling burst cuts the chain
you wont get away with this
stepping onto the bridge good day miss winch
i advise you to get some steam up before you run aground
as she floats away sidney calls out to the captain bond and wade you bastards
believe me you havent heard the last of me
bond wade and the captain
nice trick with the arrest
its no trick mr
ive got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig
dont you think youre overreacting
with great sarcasm yes
the famous james bond
ive heard all about you sir
you were under direct orders to act as an observer and yet you had to go off on your own like some half assed cia cowboy wade reacts endangering the
gold attracting that lunatic woman and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide
calmly thats all well and good captain save for one thing beat theres no gold down there
what are you talking about
we went through all this and the ship isnt even down there
yes the ship is down there
but the gold is gone
it took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold
i know what i saw i dont care what you think you saw
youre a damned amateur
beat just get off my ship
go back to your trench coats and your code names and leave the job to professionals
exchanges a glance with wade then aye aye captain
as bond and wade push away from the naval cutter where to now jimbo
thinking im not certain
but i think theres someone i want to press for some answers in kuala lumpur
bond car travels through the tropical landscape turning at a sign for kuala lumpur
as bond downshifts in anticipation of an upcoming hill his car phone rings
before answering it he looks down at displayed on separate lines incoming call
origin the display runs through numbers until it hits on
name blinking unknown
status blinking secure
reacting the information is curious
bond picks up the phone
hello mister bond
with an edge who is this
harmsway is perched on a desk
in the background through his open office door we can see harmsways executive secretary serving someone coffee from a silver tray but we cant see who it is
i heard you were in k
and thought we might get together for a chat
harmsway contd o
we seemed to get off on the wrong foot back there in venice
how did you get this number
oh please mr
we live in the information age
information is currency and with the right currency you can have any piece of information
bond reacts sourly besides i own the phone company
what do you say
im on my way
bond hangs up and drives with renewed determination
harmsway hangs up stamper is standing nearby
harmsway throws a concerned glance at his office then turns to stamper lets find out exactly what he knows
bonds car approaches the camera passes it and heads for harmsway towers looming over kuala lumpur in the distance
bonds car passes the front of the building and drives down a ramp into an underground car park
passing newspaper loading docks with trucks displaying both the tomorrow and hnn logos and hum vees used by building security bond pulls into the valet area where a cheerful young
pr woman and valet wait
both wear the colorful blazer used by all harmsway building service personnel
from inside the car james bond to see elliot harmsway
im to bring you right up
the valet will take your car id prefer to park it myself
off her questioning look temperamental
practically has a mind of its own
dont they all
she points to a spot near the loading docks
bond drives off
bond backs into the space thinking about the inevitable quick get away
he looks through the windshield surveying the area
two burly security guards in harmsway blazers stand behind a bulletproof security desk
theres a metal detector by the door
reaching inside his jacket bond removes his gun and hides it in a compartment under the dashboard
the pr woman joins bond as he locks the car with the remote control
right this way
following her through the metal detector bond scans the security devices at the guards desk lots of cameras sensors and alarms
bond and the pr woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with glass windows looking down into a mammoth newspaper printing plant
moving to a door mr
harmsway is checking the afternoon editions
if youll just follow me the noise from the printing presses is deafening
bond and the pr woman walk down a metal staircase to the pressroom floor where harmsway wearing a printers smock and newsprint cap is joking with several pressmen a fresh
issue of tomorrow outstretched in his hands
spotting bond yelling mr
nice to see you
lets get out of the noise
escorting bond off ill give you a tour of the building then well talk
harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from the press room to an elevator
theres a sink in the room
its funny mr
of all the things i own nothing gives me as much enjoyment as my newspapers
he moves to the sink to wash his hands
turns on the faucets harmsway contd ironic isnt it
in the age of tv i still cant get the ink out of my veins
bond smiles wryly looking at harmsway hunched over the sink yes
a man with ink in his veins and blood on his hands
harmsway smiles to himself acknowledging the jibe
but decides to ignore it
he turns off the faucet dries his hands we print newspapers here another two hundred and seventy at satellite plants around the world
he pulls on his saville row suit jacket
and how many of those newspapers carried paris harmsways obituary
harmsway turns and presses the elevator button
the doors open instantly
he smiles all of them mister bond
motioning inside after you
the doors close
bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling
harmsway is about to take great delight in making bond squirm before i became involved with paris she was always involved with the most inappropriate men
middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her
i tried to save her
but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior
delusions of grandeur
i wonder if it runs in the family
bursts out in a laugh the only difference between a psychopath and a genius mr
bond is the degree of success
he looks up at the digital readout going from to
still i do miss her
i only wish she could have lived to see all this
i can feel your pain
the doors open by the way what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur mister bond
harmsway motions for bond to exit
they step out into a short hallway lined with oil portraits of harmsways ancestors
double doors at both ends
people passing through
as they walk i call this the rogues gallery
i can see youve hung the rest of your relatives
pointing to the first portrait my third great uncle the earl of aberdeen negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese
moving to his son in law george harmsway made the first family fortune running opium into shanghai
moving to his son thomas who lost it smoking the opium
and my grandfather henry who opened the first telegraph station and published the colonys first english newspaper
pausing wistfully it was a city of unlimited possibility
so why did you leave
because its a dying city
since the chinese take over who knows what can happen tomorrow
moving to the last two portraits in any case this is my father charles a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations
said id never amount to anything but
passing his own portrait i turned it into this he pushes through a door into a cavernous three story room bristling with activity
at the center is the main hnn anchor desk where a news broadcast is in progress surrounded by scores of reporters desks a la cnn
around the perimeter of the room are various tv studios looking out on kuala lumpur
all are broadcasting a larry king type chat show mtv sports a kitchen where a chef is preparing something flambeed
with its walls of monitors equipment and control rooms the effect is overwhelming
harmsway will walk bond around the perimeter welcome to the new world order mr
starting to walk churchill had his armies caesar had his legions i have my divisions pointing news sports business entertainment
and these are my foot soldiers a wave of his hand people working on floors to feed newspapers cable news networks magazines and different cable tv channels in languages
and still not a thing to watch
he glances at the satellite control room with a nasa type world map
although it must be fun to have all those satellites
theyre merely tools to disseminate information
wryly or disinformation
if you wanted to say beam down a signal to send a ship off course
maybe one degree a minute
guffaws fantastic idea mr
perhaps i should buy it for a book
its totally preposterous but off bonds reaction you amuse me
and now perhaps i can amuse you
he stops at a video terminal
begins to type
first we have this james bond
i believe hes a field adjuster for lloyds of london
then we have this james bond
reading from the screen licensed to kill
aside not a bad title for that book
then or perhaps youd prefer this james bond who i believe they call
bond is not amused
harmsway is enjoying himself you see mr
bond you and i are both men of action
but your era is passing
words are the new weapons satellites the new artillery
and make no mistake about it in the right hands they can be as deadly as your walther ppk
words to live by
glancing at his watch look at the time
theres someone i want you meet about a story im thinking of publishing
as they leave bond is frustrated by harmsways i dont care what you think you know i can crush you attitude
and now harmsway plans and the operative word here is plans to use bond to tie off the one other loose thread in his perfect crime the door opens and
harmsway enters followed by bond
he calls to someone we dont see hello dear
im sorry i took so long reveal sidney is sitting across from his desk
thats okay uncle ell she freezes in mid sentence seeing bond
bond is equally surprised
what is he doing here
i see you two have met
crossing to his desk dont pout sidney
i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story
hes from lloyds of london
sly glance to bond arent you mr
hes not going to tell the truth
he was diving for the gold
harmsway sits and addresses bond matter of factly it seems mr
bond that miss winch has told me the most incredible story a sunken british warship filled with gold a british cutter firing on her billions of dollars in bullion lying
on the bottom of the strait
bond isnt enjoying this charade
obviously the british government denies all of this i told you
he was there
but as ive explained to sidney without proof theres just no story
dont you agree mr
before bond can answer but i have proof
you ran out of here so fast i didnt get to show you
bond and harmsway react with entirely different concerns harmsway wasnt expecting her to have proof bond knows that if she shows him the gold or worse the uranium tooth harmsway
will probably kill both of them to destroy the evidence and witnesses
forcing a smile and whats that my dear
sidney perhaps we should leave this to sidney cuts bond off dropping the gold bar on harmsways desk
he brought that up from the wreck
alarmed bond wants to stop sidney from reaching into her bag again sidney i wouldnt too late
she drops the uranium tooth on his desk
and what about this
any idea what this is
harmsway and bond exchange a sober look
then i believe its a depleted uranium drill bit my dear
he presses an alarm under his desk
bond reaches for the drill tooth
why dont we just take these blocking him no
i want sir elliot to keep them
harmsway stands comes around the desk well
i do believe this requires further investigation
thank you uncle elliot
no matter what the british government says i wont kill this story
his secretary appears in the doorway miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator
and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later
im sure they will
good bye mister bond
he reaches to kiss sidney and looks in her eyes a second too long
good bye darling
watching them exit his smile turns hard and bitter
as the executive secretary escorts them to the elevator bond glances out the picture window with its view of the other tower
thank you both for coming in
five floors directly down is the glass enclosed sky bridge just above him he sees two window washers being pulled up on a two man a chime sounds the elevator
bond and sidney ad lib good byes to the secretary and get in
sidney presses the button for
bond glances at the floor indi cator with reads clocks the security camera and starts looking for an escape panel
sidney watches out of the corner of her eye thinking hes nuts
glancing at the security camera do you have a gun
yanking it down you heard me
disabling it i left mine in the car
thats funny you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection
listen to me
im a british secret service agent
and we have about two minutes before harmsway kills both of us
he glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car
has anyone ever suggested that youre a paranoid psychotic
bond ignores the insult explaining as he moves under the panel harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold
its on the sea dolphin ii
boosting himself up and thanks to your little show and tell straining to open the panel giving him the evidence popping it open were the only ones who can tie
him to the crime
elliot harmsway is my uncle
blood or dutch
he was my fathers best friend
hes killed closer
you are seriously deranged
but why are we going up instead of down
he nods to the floor indicator
bond reaches down to her sidney come with me the doors open
she looks at his outstretched hand with disdain not if my life depended on it
sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction
the elevator doors close behind her
to the right she sees stamper and a harmsway blazered guard with machine pistols
does he have a gun
on stampers reply good he lunges for her grabs her spins her around overwhelming her
she struggles yelling this is a mistake
gun against her skull shut up
using sidney as a human shield stamper marches her in front of the closed elevator doors
the guard follows
they position themselves for a massacre
reaching around sidney stamper pulls out his radio stamper into radio open
the men unleash a hail of bullets then realize the car is empty
pushing sidney in front of him he enters the elevator cautiously
when suddenly bond swings down out of the escape panel like an athlete on a high bar feet first barely clearing sidneys head as he kicks stamper and the guard
in their faces
they go flying backwards
bond jumps down grabs sidney need a lift
and boosts her into the escape panel following her up
bond and sidney rush forward to the front wall as recover grab their guns move to the threshold and start raking the bond presses his body against sidney on the
front wall trying to shield her as bullets rip up the floor behind them
with his free hand bond reaches up for the latch to open the door above them
stamper stops shooting
moves to the rear of the cab under the escape panel
turns to the guard help me up
stampers head pokes up through the hole just as bond and sidney have disappeared into squeezing out from between the elevator doors which immediately close behind them bond and sidney
encounter a group of stunned office workers waiting for the elevator
to the office workers id try the stairs
as bond and sidney scamper off rushing out the stairs
barking into his radio attention all units
theyre on the st floor
harmsway is striding towards the security center radio in hand stamper
theyre not to leave this building alive
moving cautiously toward a corner of another hallway
this has got to be a mistake
the only mistake is that they didnt kill us in the elevator
at the corner bond stops seeing a guard farther down the hall his back to them checking doors
im going with you
bond frowns but doesnt have the time to argue
they start doing a duck and cover in and out of doorways to sneak up on him
harmsway bursts in on guards watching a wall of security monitors
where are they
i dont see them scanning the monitors there
bond and sidney have just come into frame sneaking up on the guard
theyre behind you lifting the radio to reply roger
over and out
bond kneels grabs the guards machine pistol and clips just as two guards have entered from a staircase door hoisting mac s
in an instant bond lets go a burst
the guards shoot back diving for cover in the staircase door
bond rolls pushes sidney into an open doorway and returns a burst from sidney is shaken
as bond stands in the doorway guarding them okay
so it wasnt a mistake
bond lets go a blast what do we do now
offer them dinner
bond glances back at the kitchen supplies
gets an idea
he sud denly twists smashing the butt of his gun down on some glassware on the counter then twists back returning a burst of gunfire
she thinks hes nuts but squeezes next to him
handing her the gun aim that way
sidney scowls as bond moves off camera when suddenly bullet hits rip up the door frame
she jumps terrified
bond looks at her from the photo copying machine where he is yanking out the toner cartridge
he offers a simple piece of advice shoot back
and as she lets the gun rip we cut to stamper running up steps with the guard
they exit into they rush though it bursting through a door into stamper and the guard start hunting bond
as she continues to exchange fire with the guards
bond having broken the toner cartridge open is dumping the toner in a coffee can
he reaches for a box of sugar one second and with gunfire sfx over bond sweeps the broken dish into the can and drops his q lighter in the mix
he moves to sidney in the doorway
in between shots how did you get into marine salvage
gun burst then my father left me the business
bond glances at his watch timing the bomb
the guards shoot she shoots back then explains i used to be a divorce lawyer in new york city
bond nods continuing to look at his watch
glances at her not a lot of difference
what do you mean
bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can either way youre taking the goods from dead hulks
he tosses the can and pulls her backwards covering her
the guards spring from the door rushing forward to storm bonds position just as the coffee can rolls towards them and explodes
lets go taking the gun the two of them start for the door when stamper and the guard have arrived at the corner blasting
swiftly bond grabs a jug of cleaner from under the sink moves to the door and rolls it down the hall in stampers direction
anticipate a bomb
they move back
what the hell does that do
bond and sidney break for the staircase door
where the first guards were shooting at them from
twisting around bond lets a burst go in stampers direction as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead guards mac l s
cowers waiting for the jug to blow up
then realizes its a trick
into his radio on the run theyre in the south stairwell
get more men up there
bond leans over the railing
sees guards coming up
they go up about three stairs and sidney sees guards descending
shoots then up
bond and sidney bound up the stairs through a metal door just as stamper and the guard bound down the hallway heading for the door
harmsway smiles watching bond on a monitor and so much for that
into radio theyre on the nd floor set back
explains to the guards nowhere to go
its magic hour as bond and sidney rush out onto the setback
bond sees a window washers rig
and although sidney asks now what
bonds first concern is to make sure stamper cant get them
amidst a pile of construction equipment he spots a pneumatic nail gun
he grabs it and bang
he fires nails through the door into the frame
that should buy us some time
now bond moves to the window washers rig a two man bucket like scaffold on tracks with two leather safety harnesses inside and a large cable spool motor that stays
on the roof
approaching it bond looks over the side twenty stories below is the sky bridge
stories below that the ground
its a long long way down
help me move this
darting up the few steps stamper and guards arrive at the door
he tries to open it
ill call for a battering ram no
get the fire ax
one of the guards grabs it from inside a fire cabinet
he hands the ax to stamper who takes the first swing at the door
bond is positioning the window washer rig
he explains well go down close to the sky bridge
we may be able to swing over and use it for cover
as bond climbs into the bucket sidney peers over the side
i do not fly
behind them stampers ax has just penetrated the door
sometimes you just have to take the plunge
bond yanks her in flips switches on the control pod and starts down as fast as they can go
bond and sidney descend
tiny specs against the sunset
stamper gives the last few chops to the door
he kicks it open
stamper and the guards rush to the ledge
bond looking up for stamper and down to check their progress
all i know is one thing if we get out of here alive that gold is mine
beat ive earned it
looking upward bond sees stamper peering over the rail
one thing at a time
stamper jumps back from the ledge enraged
ax in hand he moves to the window washing rigs machinery and takes a roundhouse swing at the unspooling cable but instead of cutting it the ax bounces off and
the rig slides on its tracks
sidney screams almost falling out
bond grabs her
they are now stories directly above the sky bridge swaying like a giant pendulum although still descending
having failed at the cable stamper goes at the pulley feeding it
with each blow the pulley shaft weakens
dropping in violent spurts just trying to stay in the damn bucket
finally the pulley shaft shatters
the cable grinds to a halt
are stopped about feet above the sky bridge
panicked anxious fast what now
and dont give me some movie cliche like trust me
what the hell trust me
and with this he turns and shoots out the adjacent window
lets go but as he starts to climb out sidney screams
the cable suddenly stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum
its coming loose from its moorings
look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge facing what she thinks is certain death were going to bounce off that thing
bond looks up assuming they have only seconds left before stamper cuts the cable
he grabs her hold on
stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum
with a great clat tering sound it snaps free of the moorings smashes into the wall and the whole mechanism careens over the side of the building
bond and sidney feel the cable give way
they start to free fall
bond fires his machine pistol at the glass top of the sky bridge
landing on the deck of the bridge
bond rolls to his feet as fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck
bond yanks sidney to the side of the building just as the cable drum looking down stamper flips open his radio
over radio theyre on the bridge
seal off the th floor
looking at the monitors i should have hired this man
to his guards get somebody up there
bond is moving to the window washer rig debris
what about the elevators
he steps to the side of the bridge and looks at the railings four inch pipe
bond begins to work feverishly we tried that already
bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses
you know this is as much your fault as it is mine
bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe
sidney we dont have time for this he pulls on the loop to test it
makes a second loop
just when i want to talk beat not that i would have believed you bond tests the second loop
turns to her put your back to the railing
sit up on it
doing it are you listening to me
put your arms around my neck
lock your legs around my waist
we have time for that
just then guards appear out of far elevator door
running they shoot
bond fires a burst back as a new round of bullet hits bond looks up stamper has commandeered a second window washers rig and is descending firing at them
bond looks at sidney sometimes you just have to dont say it
she locks her arms and legs around him he snaps the leather harness around her waist and they roll over the railing amidst gunfire
bond and sidney fall from the bridge stories up
they go down and down and down the cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent the paint on the railing is burning off and the steel itself is
starting to smoke from the friction
dropping and dropping
looking to the ground bond sees the press room observation balcony coming up fast from below
it looks like theyre going to get splattered on the tile floor when the cable comes to the end of its run
it drags the spool the bucket and all the other mechanics to the side of the bridge bond and sidney jerk to a halt
theyre swinging about five feet from the balcony
theres a pause
is this like a normal day for you
its a lousy job but reaching for the balcony the only reason i stay is for the health benefits
bond pulls them over to the balcony
stamper lands on bridge
he unbuckles his harness runs to railing looks down and sees sidney and bond climbing out onto the balcony going for the press room door
into his radio theyre heading for the press room
bond and sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs bond came down earlier to meet harmsway
the presses are running full blast the noise is deafening
at the start end of the presses where the paper is fed in bond sees a giant roll of newsprint on a crane about to be loaded
directly beyond this is the door to the elevator wash up room where bond and harmsway exited earlier
coming out of that door bond sees three guards in harmsway blazers carrying guns
bond shoots the hook on the crane carrying the newsprint roll
it crashes to the ground rolling backwards on the guards
as they start scrambling around it bond and sidney race down the stairs turning in the opposite direc tion toward the finishing end of the press near the garage
they encounter a gorilla sized pressman with an oversized crowbar
bond and the pressman square off
bond tries to get around him
the man lifts his crowbar to smash bond with it
bond tries to block the descending crowbar with his gun but the crowbar snaps it in half
bond and the pressman engage in a short furious fight throwing each other against the side of the press
which ends when bond finally gets the upper hand for a second and pushes the man back into a pile of ink drums
momentarily stunned bond forces the mans head into an open ink drum and as he comes up covered with ink gasping for air sidney bops him on the head with
now bond and sidney take off toward the garage exit but one of the guards from the crashing roll of newsprint darts out from between the banks of the printing
press tripping bond
bond stumbles face down then spins over kicking up at the guard as he comes to finish bond off
the guard stumbles backward crashing against a newspaper baling machine
a large machine that wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery
rushing the man bond struggles with him and manages to flip the baling switch literally tying the man up
the only problem is that as bond turns the last guard has sidney in a choke hold hes aiming a gun at bond
seemingly at once sidney bites the guards forearm bond ducks the guard shoots wildly the gun drops and bond rushes the man knocking him backwards into the printing press pulling
sidney away at the last moment
the guard is sucked up in the press rollers and
the pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn bright red
he was bad news
spotting more guards coming down the far staircase bond grabs sidney and the gun and runs to the newspaper delivery chute
they jump into it sliding down and around an aluminum chute into bond and sidney come out near a trolley stacked with newspapers
hearts pounding having left the pressrooms deafening noise theyre ready for almost anything except what they hear the sound of one man applauding
a polite almost bored clapping
vert very good mr
harmsway is standing with ten guards shoulder to shoulder in a straight line all holding weapons on sidney and bond
harmsway continuing im the certain the british taxpayers would be impressed by your efforts
dont you agree
i think theyd rather know who stole their gold
harmsway cant help his ego chuckles why i did of course
its on the sea dolphin ii twenty miles outside of hong kong
not that it will do either of you any good to know
beat now both of you stand up
and toss the gun out mr
bond slides the gun several feet in front of him
and throws a look to his car noting the guards are lined up directly in its path
bond begins to scheme
uncle elliot how could you do this to me
bond sneaks his hand in his pocket
oh please sidney
theres a hundred billion dollars at stake
beat besides i never really liked your father that much
he cheated at cards
bond has removed the car remote control
he palms it
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl
my guards are from south africa mr
this is their chance to get even with the formerly great britain
beat now both of you
put your hands on your heads and step forward
holding the remote control bond puts his hands on his head
hes manipulating the control into the right position to use it
trying to buy time what did you do harmsway
make some deal with the chinese government for the gold
was the radioactive uranium i found in venice part of it
he finally has the remote control in the right position
questions questions mr
which im afraid ive neither the time nor the inclination to answer
to the guards take them out to the jungle and suddenly bonds car engine starts with a roar
the guards turn in shock towards the car as bond retrieves the gun he slid out and pulls sidney behind the newspaper trolley while the car begins to move sending
the guards scrambling
bond takes his position with sidney
i forgot to mention the job comes with a car
begins shooting as kill it
shoot the damn thing the guards start blasting the empty moving car
they manage to shoot out the headlights while bond is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same time
as bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them here
you know thats another reason youre probably not in a successful relationship
did i miss something
taking the gun you insist on calling all the shots
beat and by the way i am not a helpless girl
bond eyes her for one split second
points at the guards aim that way
sidney starts to shoot as the guards continue to blast away at the car
but theres chaos a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as bond steers the car to their position where the door opens automatically
the two of them make a break for the car diving inside
bond guns the engine slams the transmission into gear
burning rubber guards bounce off the front fenders
continue to shoot at the car
run for the hum vees
hop in and chase
bond flips open a hidden control panel
flips a switch
the tail lights drop down and machine guns start to fire
bond glances at the rearview mirror
sees the hum vees
presses another switch whoosh
a missile blasts out trailing smoke as it hones in on boom
seal the garage
cut the power
hes got no headlamps
as the car screeches around a corner the overhead lights go out
bond flips down the visor a thermal imaging display drops down
it looks just like the jet fighter videos from the gulf war
bonds car roars around a second turn with sparks flying as it scrapes the walls
ahead a massive one piece door is folding down from the ceiling
a city street beyond
were not going to make it
bond flips down a control panel from the radio
a digital display begins to run through a set of numbers
bond explains if its radio controlled itll break the code
pointing to a button we blast through
after a moment we hear the sound of the lights come on
the car is a twisted wreck smashed against the wall
bond and sidney are slumped forward unconscious
harmsway knocks twice on the garage door to demonstrate built to withstand a nuclear blast
to stamper checking bonds pulse are they alive
shall we kill them
i have a better idea
in fact mr
bond may have actually improved my original plan
beat bring them both to hong kong
and make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve
it is early morning in this strange harbor a place where floating restaurant rise out of the fog where an old chinese man wearing an la lakers jersey practices tai
chi on the bow of an ancient junk where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks computer boxes and women dressed in chanel and beijing
while the captains of these small water taxis chatter away on cell phones
at the end of the harbor dominating this scene the camera finds panning down this massive dockside facility the image changes to with one important difference theres an hnn logo
in lower corner
as part of our continuing report on terrorism were outside hong kongs aberdeen harbor nuclear power plant
two video cameramen are shooting an asian hnn reporter interviewing a middle aged chinese man
we dont see the reporters face from the over the shoulder news angle hes wearing a hat
theres also hnn bell jetranger helicopter on the ground and a seemingly empty hnn boat moored to a nearby pier
asian male news reporter contd interviewing mr
david chin senior engineer in charge of security
beat tell me mr
chin how safe is this plant from a terrorist attack
he holds out a microphone to chin
without codes youd need a missile to blast through the front door you normally cant even get this close to the plant without a full security clearance
could you say that a little closer to the microphone
he pushes the microphone closer to chins face of course
youd need suddenly a puff of white smoke emerges from the microphone
and chin collapses
the hnn reporter takes off his hat its yung
to the guards now
at once the two cameramen turn one aims his shoulder mounted video camera at a surveillance camera the other aims at the front door
rockets shoot out from their lenses destroying both
as yung and the cameramen rush forward harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box of equipment
he calls back to two men who have appeared on deck get the machine in the water
they begin using a hoist to lift one of the worms from a hold
this one looks like an open mouthed torpedo with an antenna on top and no flexible tubing attached
yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception security area what happened out there
a generator blew
nothing to worry about
beat but i need one last shot of you
why dont you stand by the alarm
the guard stands and smiles posing for the video camera
and yung pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him
to the cameramen up the stairs
they follow yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control room
meanwhile back at the hnn boat bond is at the porthole wearing only shorts trying to figure a way out
he hears the door click open and a guard enters carrying a pile of bonds clothing with his shoes on top
stamper is behind him holding a gun on sidney
put on your clothes
to the guard cuff him
the guard cuffs bonds hands in the front and we cut back to yung and the cameramen sweep into the control room lots of con soles with a window overlooking
the reactor core and its surrounding blue cooling pool
to the half dozen engineers im sorry to interrupt again
but we need one more picture for the story
the engineers ad lib replies sure
yung smiles why dont you line up against the wall
lets make it a group shot
the engineers line up against a wall
the cameramen take positions for a massacre
and at the first sound of gunfire we cut to stamper is marching bond and sidney through the door in handcuffs
next time i do the driving
bond gives her a look
harmsway and yung are locking down at the video screen of a portable version of the worm controller we saw on the sea dolphin ii
the drill is in the water approaching the intake tunnel
harmsway looks up hearing i see youre in your natural element harmsway a room filled with lethal power
beat with a toxic core at its center
harmsway smiles at bond and sidney who have entered handcuffed at gun point with stamper and a guard
harmsway is charming as ever do come in mr
youre just in time for a nuclear meltdown
coming closer sidney struggles against her cuffs swinging at him you bastard stamper restrains her while bond scans the room for an advantage
he sees a machine pistol on the console
id like to remember you fondly
calling from the console approaching the first gate
start the grinders
the worm is nearing an iron sluice gate the eye closes the grinders rev and it starts to eat through the bars
so thats what the weapons grade uranium was for
in a matter of minutes the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor
beat and when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium instant melt down
chernobyl will look like a campfire
young calls out again with a hint of urgency
bond decides to try rattling harmsway so he can move closer to the gun unnoticed
were through the first gate
approaching the second demanding why harmsway
wasnt stealing the gold enough
to yung bore through
to bond chuckling they used to say living well was the best revenge mr
beat theyre wrong
beat revenge is the best revenge
entering the main tunnel ten minutes to target fiercely what could you possibly have to be vengeful for harmsway
still trying to prove yourself to daddy
this infuriates harmsway
bond moves closer to the gun
hong kong mr
you have to leave enraged ignoring yung a hundred and fifty years ago my ancestors took this island a barren lifeless rock and turned it into the greatest city known
to modern civilization
beat and now that im being forced to give it back i intend to return it in exactly the same condition a barren lifeless rock
beat the gold is merely reparations payment from the spineless british government who wouldnt listen
to sidney glancing at the gun i think uncle elliot is having his own melt down
approaching the third gate smash through it
then laugh all youd like mr
bond but you fit perfectly in to my plans
he reaches for a newspaper here
this just in
read all about it
he thrusts an issue of tomorrow at bond holding the top half out as bond reads the headlines sourly hong kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown
british agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage harmsway calls for british government to resign
harmsway smiles at bond as the advertising says tomorrow never lies
what about the gold
you must go
otherwise the boat wont be out of range stamper and the guard appear nervous itching to leave thirty seconds
then to bond thats the most brilliant part of the plan mr
bond to save the economy ill let the new british government my british government announce that the gold was irradiated in hong kong where no one will be able to
touch it for a hundred years
beat and just by coincidence he turns the paper over and reads reveals a smaller headline gold mine opens in vietnam
turns to stamper lets go
put them in the airlock
stamper moves towards bond and sidney
bond edges closer to the gun
youll never get away with it harmsway
too many people know
bond tenses ready to spring who mr
the kooks the crazies the conspiracy theorists
the oliver stones of the world
pausing then with great scorn ill publish their books ill make their movies ill put them on my tv shows
beat theyre my bellboys
they carry my luggage
bond moves but the guard picks up the gun
get them in the airlock
fortunately bond has a back up plan
as stamper hustles them off one problem harmsway the girl
and the handcuffs
theyll give it away
harmsway considers this for a second
sidney takes bonds arm
i want to stay with him
bond looks at her
hes surprised in the blink of an eye he realizes hes developed feelings for her
he knows that if he could hold her hed kiss her and whisper youre a hell of a girl
but at the same instant throwing a glance at yung he knows hes running out of time against the worm and is better off alone
breaking the moment cynically how sweet
satto to bond my timing always was lousy
cold and hard id rather die alone
take the girl
leave the handcuffs
well drown her at sea
to bond sarcastically enjoy the rest of your life
as stamper pushes bond into the reactor room airlock he hears ill meet you on the boat south of lantau island
the door closes
bond looks out the small window at take the men
i can finish alone
to the technicians and cameramen you come with me to the guard who handcuffed bond you stay here
as they exit bond has yanked his shoes off
he pulls out the plastique explosive shoelaces and opens the secret compartment in his heel revealing a detonator and ear plugs
moving quickly bond bites off a inch piece of shoelace and wraps it around the chain link connecting his handcuffs while
yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard well cut through the last gate then set it on auto pilot
he starts to maneuver the joystick and the worm turns a corner
we see feet ahead an iron gate
beyond it the blue lights from the reactor cooling pool
and beyond that
the reactor core a shimmering silver target
meanwhile back outside at water sprays violently as the hnn boat thunders out of aberdeen harbor with harmsway at the helm
junks and sampans are tossed in his wake as bond finishes pressing the shoelaces around the door lock
then turns up his shirt collar to pull out a wire thats been hidden inside
he connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the detonator then steals a glance out the window at still guiding the worm with the joy stick
his eyes are focused on where yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen
he presses a nearby button marked start grinders
and the video goes black replaced by the words grinders engaged
the worm bares its lethal teeth and revs up to speed
meanwhile closes his eyes presses the detonator and hears a small boom from inside the airlock
to the guard check it out
the guard picks up his machine pistol starts to the door
bond with his hands now free is quickly rewiring the detonator to the plastique explosive around the door handle
the worms teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars
the door blows open with a shattering blast
the guard is blasted backward dead
bond rolls out scrambling for the weapon
yung slams his hand on a button marked auto pilot
a caption appears on the video screen target locked and as bond grabs the gun bringing it up to shoot yung dives on top of him
they struggle and the gun skitters across the floor towards the window overlooking the blue cooling pool
breaking free bond moves around a console for the gun
yung takes a shortcut leaping on and then over the console as chews through the last of the iron bars and glides through the hole toward the silvery reactor core
have squared off in a short brutal martial arts battle
the fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the reactor core window the gun lies on the ground between them
they trade punch after punch and although bond is holding his own yung is every bit his equal
backing off bond spins into a crescent kick but yung catches bonds foot and shoves bond backwards crashing against a wall near a fire extinguisher
meanwhile all through this
as yung reaches down for the gun bond grabs the fire extinguisher from the wall
he rushes yung blasting him with co
in the white smoke yung drops the gun
then charges at bond headbutting him twisting and turning
smashing bond the window shatters
bond is winded
and as he struggles to stop himself from falling backwards into the reactor room
yung does a flying feet first kick to finish the job but at the last second bond ducks reaches up and uses yungs momentum to send him flying over bonds
head into he sails through the air heading for the cooling pool below as bond races to hit the emergency reactor shut down button
he pulls a fire alarm disconnects the worm and sets off an emergency decontamination system spraying the room with a mist of water
finally bond retrieves the gun and pauses to look down at theres a cloud of red in the middle of the blue water
bond goes to the dead guard
gets the key removes his handcuff bracelets then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder and exits
with the sound of fire engines approaching in the background bond straps the dead guard into the passenger seat and takes off
the hnn boat has pulled alongside the sea dolphin ii
the gang from the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat
note from the air we should notice that the gold hold is now covered by a steel hatch and the biggest worm is stored in the open hanging from a
coming up the ladder first harmsway is greeted by the captain
the call just went out on the hong kong police radio fire at the power plant
ironically alert the media
stamper and sidney have climbed onto the deck
what do you want me to do with her
cant we make a deal
i wont say anything touching her cheek youre so cute my dear
beat but im afraid not
to one of the cameramen put her in the storage room
the cameraman takes her away
harmsway turns to the captain well get rid of her when were in international waters
then set sail full speed due south
ill be in my cabin
let me know when mr
well break out the champagne
near the engine room indicating were near the bottom of the boat the cameraman opens a door to a small cramped room with a bench and scuba equipment
he pushes sidney inside
dont get any ideas
then locks the door on her
several hundred feet in the air the helicopter is heading for an island in the distance
bond checks the compass and adjusts his course
the compass swings the helicopter clears the island bright blue sea ahead
bond sees then passes over the hnn boat bobbing empty in the water
then further ahead he spots the stern of sea dolphin ii shimmering in the instance
looking north off the back of the boat stamper and a crewman see the helicopter a tiny speck in the air
there it is
stamper lifts a pair of binoculars for confirmation
he sees two figures in the cockpit
stamper picks up his radio its him
they both made it
the captain replies ill tell sir elliot
harmsway is working at a computer
a chime sounds
hes approaching from the north sir
invite the crew on deck to celebrate and ill be up in a few minutes
bond is about two miles out from the stern of the sea dolphin ii
maybe in the air
taking the machine pistol from the dead guards lap he opens the small pilots window and balances it on his knees
ahead he sees the crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad near the ships railings
ready for war
he pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward and the bell jetranger goes into a screaming descent
champagne bottles pop
stamper is with a crewman who looks up at the chopper about off the stern he seems to be coming in awfully fast
stamper picks up his binoculars
he sees bond
get the guns
its not him
he might have also added its too late as bond swoops in low on the port side of the boat firing his gun from the pilots window and using the
choppers blades to threaten the men on deck
about half of them dive into the water for safety only to be quickly left behind
flying up the port side toward the front of the boat bond passes the windows rattle as bonds chopper thunders by
perplexed harmsway stands opens the porthole curtains
he cranes his neck but sees nothing
he presses an intercom button what the hell is going on
on a phone i dont know sir the helicopter suddenly appears in front of him
shooting from the pilots window bond shatters the glass windows and the captain slumps forward on the wheel spinning it as he slides to the deck
the boat pitches wildly harmsway looses his balance crashing into a wall
sidney is thrown from her bench slamming against scuba tanks
stamper bounces himself handing out automatic weapons from an arms cache hidden inside a dinghy
the two cameramen take their m s and rush forward jumping up on some machinery to climb onto they rush forward and assume positions shooting at bond
bond pivots and turns the chopper heading straight for them
the men turn and start to run as the chopper chases them shirts
the man are flailing like crazy as and the men burst through their shirt buttons falling shirtless into the sea
bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down and in on the boat
but he doesnt see a small rocket streaking upward from the boat
stamper is holding a shoulder mounted launcher
it hits the engine
the gauges go crazy the alarms go berserk
the entire cockpit is chattering as bond struggles to remain in control
harmsway is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat continues to veer out of control
he pauses to look up at bond forces the cyclic forward
the helicopter pitches forward hes heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold
whoever is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way
struggling with the wheel harmsway picks up the radio what the hell is going on
with the worm dangling from a boom in the background he watches with the chopper about feet above the gold hold just barely under control bond opens the door
he leaps out onto the hatch and rolls off disappearing as the chopper crashes onto the gold hold in a giant ball of flame and twisted metal
sidney looks up hearing and feeling the explosion
harmsway regains control of the boat he takes a gun from the dead captain and pushes the body out
with flaming debris still falling around him bond is stealthily moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship
bond has two goals in mind at this point first to neutralize any threats and second to save sidney if shes still alive
arriving at a bulkhead door bond checks both directions down the passageway then pokes his head inside and is suddenly yanked backwards out into the passageway thrown against a railing
bond looks up stamper stands with a smile on his face
one arm is raised above his head grasping the worm on the swinging boom
the worm is attached to the boom by a thin metal cable
youre mine now
bond rushes at stamper slamming into him
the man doesnt flinch
with his free hand he grabs bond by his shirt and throws him against a steel wall
bond crashes to the deck
as bond recovers stamper still smiling presses a red button on a wall and the worm comes to life
stamper closes in on bond with the worm
bond tries to stand but stamper flings him back down pinning bond against the wall with his free hand as he with the cutting blades whirring inches away from bonds
nose im going to do this slowly bond executes a scissor kick to stampers ankles
stamper tumbles sideways
bond rolls away from the worm but by the time bond gets to his feet stamper has recovered and is rushing at bond full force with the worm
stamper thrusts the worm at bond once
the worm chews into the wall
pulling the device back stamper thrusts a second time same action then a third same action still missing bond
with all the yanking and pulling a loop of slack has developed in the cable on the ground
stamper is about to attack bond a fourth time when bond kicks him in the groin
stamper doubles over in pain and the worm flies out of his hand swinging on the boom over the the grinders propel the worm forward into the hull
hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall
barking into the radio stamper
as stamper straightens up winded from the groin kick continuing on stampers radio report to the bridge
bond rushes to a small pile of slack cable which is rapidly growing taught as the worm wends its way underwater
stamper rushes bond and in one lightening fast move bond wraps the cable twice around stampers neck
suddenly the cable tightens and stamper soars in the air hanging by his neck as the worm bursts through the wall
a torrent of water floods in pushing sidney off to one side
its zooming at the door
the door bursts open sending tons of water into the passageway
the boat shudders violently sending harmsway crashing against a wall cutting his head
as the boat rocks bond steadies himself then starts for the bridge using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper first climbing up on some machinery then
up onto the bridge roof
sidney is thrashing for air with only a few inches left between the rising water and the ceiling
filled with water
the worm is heading for a door
we see the door disintegrate in front of us as the worm bursts into with the water cascading over the camera as if we were riding inside an ocean wave
the worm heads for a tank marked fuel
the boat is sinking
bond is running across the bridge roof when harmsway is thrown backwards
gun in hand he makes his way up the incline to the port side door
just when he thinks hes made it bang
bond appears in the doorway having jumped down from the roof on the small exterior walkway
hes seething with rage
harmsway looks up at him
blinks in disbelief
i never believe what i read in the newspapers
harmsway slowly brings up the gun
pity youll miss your obituary
bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt
where is she harmsway
the fuel tanks explode in the distance
the bridge rocks violently the room tilts to a greater angle
you want to kill me bond
with both arms bond pushes harmsway backwards flinging him downward against the starboard wall
the water is rising on the bridge
moving in on him where is she harmsway
he grabs harmsway by the lapels and throws him against the front wall crashing onto the instrument panel head first
harmsway laughs maniacally face down on the gauges what is it bond
you havent the guts
theres another explosion in the background
the front of the boat tilts upward
the water is rushing in
bond grabs harmsway by the shoulder you spineless paper tiger and yanks him off the instrument panel flinging him backwards against the rear wall of the bridge
where is she harmsway
or did you kill her like paris
suddenly the boat groans
the bridge rises out of the water
and bond loses his balance falling onto harmsway glaring insanely we all go down together
harmsway lunges for bonds throat where bond breaks harmsways grasp in a violent struggle then punches him
air bubbles break from harmsways mouth
he frantically tries to break free for the surface but bond pulls him back down and holds him down pushing down on harmsways shoulders
harmsway is thrashing about flailing in all directions pounding at bond in a haze of bubbles
then falls still
with his lungs aching bursting with fire bond rockets up through the bridge windows up to he breaks through the water gasping for air
and then almost instantly dives down again
bond dives for the boat down and down chasing it as if he could just grab it and stop it from sinking
he goes deeper and deeper as it sinks further and further away just beyond his reach
and just when it seems impossible for him to survive to hold his breath a second longer a figure in scuba gear mask and tank grabs him
bond turns in disbelief
stares into the mask its sidney
she puts her regulator in bonds mouth
and they share the air as they rise from the depths
they break through the water
sidney yanks off her mask
teases what do you mean youd rather die alone
i didnt say when i want to die she splashes him
turning away bond spots stampers arms cache dinghy floating nearby
bond climbs into it then helps sidney get in
they collapse in the bottom of the boat resting their heads against the gunwale
after a beat sidney clears her throat
bond is already amused yes
before we go any further here mr
bond from lloyds of london i just want to get two things straight
first that boat is in international waters
im claiming it for salvage
one third of that gold is mine
and number two
if you think were going to have some kind of life affirming romance here just because we cheated death let me be clear pause were going to have it where
i want and when i want
and when might that be
she falls into his arms
they kiss and we cut to with the dinghy reflected in the glass
in unison they are both lowered revealing q and wade
as usual i see the situation is in s very capable hands
life is not fair
emphatically youre right
a british naval officer appears
excuse me major boothroyd the message went to london
q and wade throw a glance back to the sea then turn waking off tell me q ster
you do ever do any gardening
the only thing i ever planted was bugs
on the wall behind ms desk
moneypenny sits across from m with a steno pad
moneypenny take the following release beat the body of sir elliot harmsway was found floating in the south china sea this morning at hours local hong kong time
pauses at present local authorities believe the media mogul committed suicide
bond and sidney break off a kiss
she lies nestled in his arms
is this really what a typical day is like for you
bond replies with a wry smile yes
pause but some days
are longer than others
and with this he reaches up over his head and pulls a tarp over the two of them
and the camera pulls back and up rising into the air to reveal the entire british navy closing in on them from all points of the compass
save for one last line james bond will return
