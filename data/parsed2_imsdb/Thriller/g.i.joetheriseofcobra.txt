the following words sear onto screen whenever a new breed of evil emerges a new breed of solider must fight it
a heavy night mist swirls around the imposing stone walls of the bastille
prison guards patrol outside with their pikes as the screams of prisoners echo out the barred windows
a pair of huge prison guards walk down a row of filthy prison cells
whimpering starving prisoners appear and disappear in the flickering light of the wall torches
a large rat nibbles some stale bread in the corner watching the guards
finally the two guards reach a cell whose prisoner is not at all whimpering or starving
a huge scotsman with a proud defiance in his eyes a red square medallion dangling around his neck glares through the bars
this is james mccullen
the guards unlock his cell door matchlock muskets at the ready
mccullen stares at the muskets unimpressed
he speaks with a thick scottish brogue
still using matchlocks are ya
i can get you a pair of flintlocks you let me sneak out of here
everyone else in this sequence speaks with a french accent
the other guard glares at him
mccullen goes for the kill
and perhaps a couple of pretty young ladies to teach you how to use them
guard is even more tempted but his partner is a loyalist
on yer feet you scottish pig
huge sweaty bare chested prison workers mould something in a furnace a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs
the two prison guards muscle mccullen into the room and start to fasten him to a standing rack as a priest begins reciting the lords prayer in latin
the warden steps up and reads the charges off a scroll of paper
james mccullen you have been found guilty of treason for the sale of military arms to the enemies of our lord king louis xiii
even whilst you sold arms to our lord himself
your king is a vile bag of filth who murders his own allies
i shouldve charged him double
you tried to overthrow the crown in conspiracy with its enemies
they offered me a chancellorship because unlike your simpleton king they know that is the mccullen destiny to run the wars the true power not simply to supply arms
do you have anything else to say before the sentence is carried out
yes i do
clan mccullen is far bigger and more powerful than any of you could ever imagine
my sons will continue to rise along after i am gone
as will their sons
and god willing their sons
it shall not end with my death
the warden smiles back sinisterly
oh were not going to kill you mccullen
were going to make an example of you
the warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the metallic object from the fire
mccullen sees what it is before we do and his face fills with fear
its a metal mask being carried towards him the hinges open with a hideous creak
mccullen begins to struggle against the rack
so that no man woman nor child may ever see your treacherous face again you shall wear this mask for the term of your natural life
the mask closes around his face
the workers melt the lock
and we push in on the red square medallion
the many flags of nato flap outside its massive headquarters
war used to be the exception
now it is the new state of play a constant unavoidable
the red square medallion around the neck of james mccullen gazing over a lectern in a darkened room
like his doomed ancestor mccullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes
tragic as they are to fight wars must be won
but perhaps they dont have to be as destructive as theyve been in the past
a series of complex schematics rolls continuously on a screen behind him
mccullen is briefing twenty two nato military commanders many of them listening in translation headphones
perfect little soldiers
their size can be programmed as well as their intended task
originally developed to isolate and destroy cancer cells but at mars industries and with the help of a little nato funding
a few laughs around the room
mccullen soaks it up
we discovered how to program them to eliminate most anything
on screen a soldier fires a shoulder launched missile at a tank
the warhead bursts into millions of silver microscopic nano mites which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a horse
then the nano mites fan out from the consumed tank and quickly head for a nearby jeep
once the target has been destroyed the launcher triggers a kill switch unique to each warhead that short circuits the nano mites preventing any unwanted destruction
on screen the soldier hits a kill switch on the launcher and the nano mites instantly drop dead around the nearby jeep
each warhead contains seven million nano mites and has the ability to eat anything from a single tank to an entire city
to consummate salesman but without innocent casualties
which is why this has been such a priority for me and my company
the room breaks into applause
focuses on general hawk a british veteran or countless battles not buying it
guess youll be the first arms dealer up for the nobel peace prize
laughter in the room
mccullen smiles being a good sport
i prefer the term armament solutions engineer more chuckles gentlemen
im pleased to announce that tomorrow morning your first order of nanotech warheads will ship from my factory in kyrgyzstan
four glass like warheads each the size of a softball are placed into four separate compartments inside a weapons case by a pair of lab workers
the kill switches are secured next to each warhead
as the case is closed and locked we see the mars industries red square medallion logo on its cover
a pair of dog tags drop into frame in slow motion
we see the name hauser conrad r
still not seeing his face we watch our soldier strap into his body armor and clip on his battle harness
his name tag simply reads duke
he loads his into the mirror is that a look of disdain
and we get our first glimpse of our hero a handsome rugged combat veteran with a battle scar under his right eye
the sound of retching comes from the stall behind duke
there is a flush and a strapping young special forces soldier stalworth steps out
he goes to the sink next to duke and splashes water on his face
hes pale and sweaty
the hells wrong with you stalworth you didnt eat that chicken a la king at chow did ya
the mission sir
what about it
another day another run
never had anything to worry about before
stalworths shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to duke a young mother with a newborn in her arms
three weeks old
be seeing him for the first time next leave
duke looks at the picture then at stalworth
his eyes go distant thinking about his own past then they harden again
youre off the mission
thats what you want right
stalworth doesnt argue
duke hands him back the photo
if your heads with them youre no good to me
duke steps closer now one mean s
one thing though you step off this one youre out of special forces
gonna find you a nice desk and chair back at the base
youre be run of the mill
i guess i can live with that
then you should
stalworth nods grabs his kit and leaves
dukes hard eyes watch him go then a slight smile creases his lips
mccullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside shaking hands with various military commanders
hawk watches with his aide a gorgeous german lieutenant courtney cover girl krieger
when mccullen is alone hawk makes his move
mr mccullen clayton aernathy british army
shaking hands i know who you are general hawk
as sharp in a briefing room as your reputation is on the battlefield
you gave me a broad target i couldnt resist
its an honor to meet a man of your many accomplishments
mccullen smiles then offers hawk to walk with him
whats on your mind general
securing them in transit
forty pairs of ears in that room now know the when and where
those ears all have top security clearance
we both know what thats worth
look general delivery is my responsibility and its not one i take lightly
i had nato assign an elite american special forces unit a fully armored convoy with air support
i assure you my warheads will be quite safe
ive made a career of showing up where im needed whether ordered to or not
and if your warheads are half as effective as you say they are
then my unit is needed
this is no time to play catch up
the nato teams been drilling for weeks
theyre lit up and ready to roll
my unit doesnt need mission specific training
theyre chosen because of their ability to handle any situation
maybe next time general
moves to go stops what did you say your unit was called
i just said they were always ready
mccullen continues on down the hall
hawk gives cover girl a look she reads it and nods
we smash cut to a four man security detail escorts two lab workers as they enter a high tech delivery bay and wlak past two cougar patrol vehicles and a
huge armored grizzly truck all armed with state of the art rooftop weapons
fifteen special forces soldiers stand at attention in front of duke
all right listen up the cougars will be front and back grizzly in the middle carrying the package
minimum distance at all times
choppers will cover us overhead
the lab workers step up
duke turns to them and start signing forms as wallace ripcord weems takes the case while a little short on academic credentials rip is long on confidence charm and courage
these two guys are as close as brothers for better and for worse
rip looks at the lab guy with a jokey grin
not gonna explode is it
dead serious theyre not weaponized yet
and the kill switches are attached to the launchers
all the same id avoid potholes if i were you
ripcord stares then quickly hand the case off to another soldier
duke shoots him a look and ripcord shrugs what
why not stick it in a chopper and fly it out
if you want i could we have our orders
were on the clock lets move
duke gives rip another look
rip throws him a cheesy grin
the team mounts up
the weapons case to grizzly
and the convoy rolls out
the convoy charges out of the heavily guarded factory gates passing a sign military armaments research syndicate
two blackhawk helicopters swoop in and follow the convoy
ripcord drives the lead cougar duke beside him
two more guys in back remotely panning a rooftop dual machine gun
into radio mother goose this is bird dog
we have the package and are on the dot to make ganci air base ar
you know i hate all the mother goose bird dog crap i just wish theyd let us say hey pete its bill see ya in a few
not me i joined up for the jargon
roger that bird dog
mother goose out
just saying you know if i ran things
rip if you ran the army wed stay up all night fill our canteen with tequila and call each other bro
but wed be badasses right bro
with a sigh yeah wed be badasses
eyes on the road rip
the two blackhawks sweep through the skies silhouetted by the rising sun
below them the convoy is thundering down a winding road amid the magnificent tian shan mountain range
a radar dish on the rear cougar sweeps vigilantly
inside a special forces soldier watches the radar monitor clear except for two steady signatures the blackhawks
in the lead cougar duke and ripcord keep their eyes out
hey duke ya know how they always tell you to empty your head of distracting thoughts on these runs
keep your eyes on the road rip
and you know how people sometimes joke that it must be easy fr me to keep my mind empty
dont listen to em
you got plenty of thoughts up there
into radio keep rear security tight boys
well the second i try and make myself not have thoughts i always have em
like now know what im thinking about
please dont say the air forces
the air forces
i thought we were done with that discussion
you were done with it not me
look i loev flying
duke mouths the following sentence as ropcord says it ive been flying since i was thirteen years old
ripcord shoots him a look
duke just smiles
i dont think your daddys crop duster counts as hours logged
jets man jets
you know i always qualify when im on leave
yeah yeah look you want to get up in the air well get you a trampoline back at the base
weve done ten years in the army i just think we should see if the grass really is greener
this continues to be the stupidest idea youve ever come up with nd thats saying something
i dont wanna transfer to the air force okay
its always about you isnt it
give me one good reason
i want to be in the fight not flying over it
wont be saying that when you call in an air strike and i come screaming in to save your eyes on the road rip
behind the blackhawks and the convoy an ominous dark shape suddenly drops into frame
engine exhaust blurs our view of the aircraft but we can tell that its pursuing the convoy
on the rear cougars radar screen we see the two blackhawk signatures still appearing in position
but nothing else
they hit a pothole
ripcord grimaces then realizes hey on the training run werent there herders around here
this puts duke instantly on the alert
concussion cannons slide out of ports on both sides of the dark shape
they fire simultaneously
the subatomic blasts punch into the front blackhawk crushing it like a beer can on your forehead
it explodes and drops
duke and rip see the hall of flaming metal crash in front of them blocking the convoys path
rip hits the brakes
urgent but utterly calm back up
into radio mother goose this is bird dog
we are under attack
repeat we are under attack
the second blackhawk pivots to see the dark shape its like a giant helicopter without rotors hovering on six jet thrusters
its a next gen typhoon gunship
the blackhawk hoses the typhoon with its six barrelled mini guns
but the rounds bounce off the typhoons angled armor
the concussion cannons fire at the second blackhawk catching it on the nose crushing it into a flaming ball and sending it reeling ass over tail rotor into the ground
behind the rear cougar hemming in the convoy
the grizzly launches two heat seeking missiles off its roof turret but the typhoon guns them down and fires again
the blast lands directly on top of the rear cougar literally flattening it as well as every tree within a hundred feet
duke sees it all in his rear view mirror yells into radio out
everyone get out of the vehicles
a final concussion blast lands between the last two vehicles now
spinning the grizzly
its windows shatter and a thousand lethal glass shards shoot inside killing the drivers
the cougar flips end over and lands in a ditch
duke and ripcord land on the upturned ceiling beat to shit
duke quickly checks on the two guys in back crushed to death where the blast caved in the cougars armor
he looks at rip
yeah except for all the blood
duke sees blood on the back of rips head
then they hear a loud roar and turn to see the typhoon hover by the grizzly
who the hell is that
duke grabs ripcord and starts dragging him out
a side door on the typhoon hisses open to reveal six vipers menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black battle armor and armed with fearsome pulse rifles
they exit the typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left
the decimated special forces troops in the grizzly open fire with assault rifles but the bullets cant penetrate the viers armor
the vipers fire back the impact from their pulse rifles crush the soldiers bodies armor and all and fling them backwards
two soldiers pop two fragmentation grenades and toss them toward the typhoon
the vipers shoot one grenade out of the air with their pulse rifles
it explodes well out of range as the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the pack
another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six feet underground
a dull whoomp lifts the ground by a foot
meanwhile another figure emerges out of the typhoon
long slender legs in high black boots the rest if her covered in black form fitting body armor
shes beautiful exotic and most of all lethal
shes known in certain circles only as the baroness but we will know her as ana
her dark glasses glint menacingly as she strides towards the grizzly
the two special forces soldiers who threw the grenades pop up to shoot her
but she quick draws a pair of pulse pistols
the shots crush both soldiers
ana flips the pistols back into her holsters as a viper blows the back door off the grizzly allowing her to climb inside
she blithely steps around the corpses and removes the weapons duke now has rip ver his shouders and is running like hell
if i die
youre not gonna die
i just want you to know
you never could run worth a damn
im just saying its be nice if you could move a little faster
and thats when the cougar blows a concussive blast
ana turns with the weapons case in time to see duke and rip go ass over teacups down into a ditch
she touches the stem of her glasses which zoom in on duke
down in the ditch duke rolls over and looks at rip
really messed up sure
im gettin that package
duke leaps up and hauls ass down the ditch then crouch runs up the embankment
and comes face to face with a viper who raises his pulse rifle about to blow duke away
a hand clamps down over the barrel
the viper looks at ana beside him
duke also looks at her a flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face
ana touches the stem of her glasses and the dark lenses turn clear revealing her gorgeous eyes
what the hell
her face softens hesitantly
then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face knocks him out on his ass
you have to admit you had that coming
ana struggles with something going on inside her head
then her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the first vipers gun barrel giving duke an apologetic look
good bye duke
duke cant believe it
ana suddenly glances up at something behind duke
its a howler transport rocketing onto the scene its four winged jet thrusters rotating ninety degrees to slow it into a hover
duke takes the opportunity to jump to his feet and lay out in the viper
ana turns and hauls ass
a black clad figure fast ropes down out of the howler and lands behind a viper and snaps his neck
moving in a blur he draws and buries a katana blade into another viper
then he glances at the last viper whos lining up on him too far away to reach with his sword
he quick draws a glock pistol
right between the eye slit in his helmet
all this in the space of six breathless seconds
duke glances at the almost mystical figure of snake eyes sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking glock
red ninja clan marking on his tri cep
bad ass defined
snake eyes leaps behind the cougar wreck as a pulse burst just missed him
duke immediately takes off after ana his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands pulse bursts crackling past his head
he curses under his breath air force
a viper lines up on duke but a laser like arrow bolt rips through his eye slit and electrocutes him courtesy of shana scarlett ohara who fast ropes down from
the howler holding a gas propulsion crossbow pistol
she lines up on another viper but hes too quick ducks behind the grizzly
but scarletts crossbow pistol viewfinder snapped an image of his face armor
she darts behind the cougar wreck with snake eyes swiftly targeting the vipers eye slit on her pistols led screen
then she fires behind her in the complete other direction to the viper the arrow bolt flies away then turns around and zeroes in on the viper finding him behind
cover the smart arrow slams right through his eye slit
another viper sees this and bolts toward the typhoon but lamont heavy duty morris leans out of the landing howler holding a dual machine gun grenade launcher
only a man this big can carry such a weapon
time to lay down some bass
he fires a grenade and the viper flies back out of frame
you blink you miss it
the typhoon fires at heavy duty but the howler is just as nimble fires its left side thrusters which roll it onto its side
the concussion blasts whip past and decimate the forest behind it
hanging awkwardly heavy duty fires a double blast of hand grenades
the typhoons mini gun quickly shoots them out of the air
the howler fires missiles which hit the concussion cannons and rip them apart
the typhoon shakes
ana races for the recovering typhoon
duke races after her through a hail of pulse fire and draws his pistol
she whirls around drawing the weapons case over her chest and face using it as a shield
duke hesitates because of the warheads or ana
heavy duty goes to shoot at her
heavy duty reluctantly doesnt shoot everyone watching ana backpedal towards the waiting typhoon
duke charges like a bull and tackles her
ana sprawls and the case tumbles free
duke and ana go eye to eye for a split second then duke goes after the case while the joes take the opportunity to spray gunfire her way
ana zigs zags and dives into the typhoon which is raked by the bullets
duke grabs up the case as the typhoon launches into the sky and disappears over a rise
scarlett snake eyes and heavy duty now approach duke who whirls around at them pistol up eyes wild
stand the hell down
lower your weapon sir
were not the enemy
pointing weapons at me doesnt make you my friend
abel breaker shaz jumps out of the howler wearing a computerized surveillance suit a french tunisian accent please hand over the case sir
i dont know who you are and i sure as hell dont know who they are and until i find out im not lowering anything or handling anything over
they turn to see ripcord shouldering a rifle
whats your unit
snake eyes discreetly grabs shrunken throwing stars from his belt but a look from scarlett makes him out them back
someone would like a word with you
breaker sets a holo projector on the ground in front of duke which projects a d image of general hawk
duke is stunned
state you name and rank
my team just saved your life
nows the part where you say thank you
those arent the words that come to mind just now
we werent told about any support for this mission so you better tell your team to stand down
ripcord eyes his sight
happy to turn this into a turkey shoot
someone off projector hands hawk a file he looks at it
you must be
ripcord expert marksman weapons specialist jet to duke told ya
im general clayton abernathy
you may have heard of me
a glint of recognition flickers across dukes eyes he nods
afghanistan nato forward command
breaker sees his chance and gingerly steps up to duke and starts sweeping a scanner across the case
that was my last job
a twinkle in his eye im in a whole new outfit now
duke swivels his gun to breakers head
just need to deactivate its tracking beacon for security
hand over the weapons case son and let us deliver the warheads
i signed for em
my mission my package
i carry them i deliver them
breakers scanner beeps
he keys a button
the beeping promptly stops
he throws a look at duke
wasnt hard was it
but you seem to be a little short on transportation a the moment
team alpha will deliver you to me
and where exactly are you general
hawk stands in front of a holo cam amongst a sea of computers cover girl behind him duke on a monitor
come see for yourself
the howler skims over the giant pyramids of giza a caravan of camels below
the aircraft continues out into the golden desert too fast for anybody to get a good look at it
scarlett is cleaning ripcords head wound
hey youre cute
hes going into shock
whats your name darlin
snake eyes stabs ripcord hard int he arm with a drip needle rip angrily eyeballs him and stifles a scream
i thought all the special ops guys were tough
we are tough
but also sensitive
feeling the drugs whoa thats some mucho primo stuff you gave me
rip is high now his eyes float up to heavy duty who stares back at him
rip reaches out to touch his well cropped hair
and a kung fu grip
the names heavy duty
duke has the weapons case on his lap
what kind of outfit is this
not regular army based on the accents
to scarlett i have you as an aussie
looks to heavy duty and youre a johannesburger
then breaker and you french north africa
where were you born
are you kidding me
duke wasnt born he was government issued
but somehow youre all in the same unit
one you cant tell me the name of right
wed get tossed for telling
duke duke dont you get it theyre super secret theyre mission impossible
this tapes gonna self destruct in five youre gonna go after them arent you
the ones that hit my convoy
then whoever you are whatever this unit is i want in
not our call
ripcord sits up really woozy looks at scarlett
i want in too
that way we can spend some bunker time together
a sword suddenly slices across rips face an inch away
its snake eyes checking his blade seemingly innocent
but the message is not lost on ripcord
scarlett looks at duke
you two a team or something
weve been together forever
off her look but not like that
hi im ripcord
why do they call you that
breaker laughs reading ripcords file because his name is wallace weems
eight security technicians sit around an island console in a small windowless room
working their keyboards and watching the holographic image of the howler soaring across the dunes
a technician hits a large switch on his console
alpha one this is base
you are cleared or entry
and a huge sand dune directly in front of howler spirals open to reveal a cavernous hole
the howlers thrusters twist vertical and it drops like a helicopter into the hole
super global integrated joint operating entity
the howler descends beneath the surface onto a dark platform as the roof spirals shut and flood lights switch on
the door of the howler opens and the team steps out
duke and ripcord follow hesitantly with the weapons case
a voice calls out to them from the shadows welcome to the new pit
duke and ripcord turn to see hawk and cover girl walking out from behind the lights
ive read a lot about you two
okay look i didnt steal that blackhawk i was borrowing it
duke shoots him a look
hawk steps right up to duke
matter of fact i saw that one of my subordinates tried to recruit you to our little operation a while back
i was never asked to join any op group
remember a tall gentleman approaching you in thailand when you were on leave four years ago
right before you tore up the bar
my man had some issues
duke shoots him another look then turns back to hawk
this doesnt look like any tac op ive ever seen
where are we
okay you trusted me by going with my team so ill trust you
theres a loud metallic clang and part of the platform begins to descend
they pass the urban combat level where men and women are training with next gen urban warfare equipment
technically gi joe doesnt exist
but if it did itd be comprised of the top men and women from the best military units all over the world
the alpha dogs
they see a pretty woman sip into a next gen camo suit which reflects and refracts light making her nearly invisible
oh man i want one of those
the suit or the girl
scarletts eyes roll
they descend into the desert combat level where soldiers train with desert warfare equipment
ten nations signed on in their first year
working together sharing intel
now we have twenty three
ive never seen combat gear this sleek whats the trick
they reach the deep sea combat level where dozens of men and women are testing fantastic next gen underwater vehicles
good news is weve been pretty successful so far
the bad news is whenever we manage to shut down one organization another springs up in its place
who could possibly fund all this
hawk now leads the group into the control room where more technicians man consoles
duke still has the weapons case
mccullens standing by sir
patch him through please
so who hit us out there
and howd that bitch in leather get a jump jet like ours
whoever she is shes clearly well financed with access to highly classified intel and state of the art weaponry
their capabilities are beyond anything weve ever encountered
thats the reason we got our asses kicked
duke betrays nothing
hawk looks at him
were going to need to find out everything we can about her
knowing is half the battle
whats the other half
mccullen now appears next to ripcord and walks through him
and we realize mccullen is here courtesy of a holo projector
a ring of cameras provides him with images of the joes
gentlemen this is james mccullen ceo of mars industries the man who built these warheads
we intercut this scene with mccullen standing in front of a holo cam in a small room somewhere
the holographic images of hawk duke and the others around him
general most men ive encountered in this business over promise and under deliver
youre the opposite
clearly you were the security option i should have chosen
on duke steaming behind his military demeanor
my team did everything we could out there
a lot of good men went down but not you
that mission was classified sir
clearly somebody sold us out
ive spent ten years and thirteen billion euros creating these four warheads
your job captain was to protect them and if it wasnt for general hawk you wouldve failed
thats not a fair assessment
he followed his orders to the letter
well that wasnt enough
mccullen turns to hawk
what are your coordinates
ill have nato send another special ops team to retrieve the warheads company strength this time
apologizes mr mccullen
its not that i dont trust you
i dont trust anybody
are you sure youre not a mccullen
i dont talk smooth enough to be a mccullen
you do just fine general
now so the bastards who attacked you cant find you you need to disable the tracking beacon hidden in the case
we already have
so can i count on you to deliver the warheads to nato now
i think it unwise to expose them at the moment
this group might make another attempt
we need to find and neutralize them before we can consider moving your weapons
but allow me to check the warheads to see if any have been damaged
duke begrudgingly sets the case down
breaker turns on his suits ball eyepiece
it goes into x ray mode and we see the nano mites crawling around inside the four warheads
open it please
my scan says theyre intact
whats the code
on duke listening carefully
five two nine four four oh
breaker enters the code
as the case opens breaker discreetly watches mccullen in his ball eyepiece scanner
mccullen runs his holographic fingers over the warheads
satisfied he turns to hawk
please keep me informed of your progress general
duke and mccullen share a quick glare
and then mccullen cuts the feed
scarlett notices concern on breakers face
that blokes beta waves were going up down and sideways
i think hes hiding something
and off the faces of the rest of the group we cut back to
mccullen turns as ana appears on a holo projector behind him
i spend five years setting this up
wringing money out of nato
this was supposed to be the easy part
if youd let me stage the assault at your precious factory we could have contained the situation
and lost the trust of our clients in the process
it had to be natos fault
steps closer what happened
did you hesitate
youre implying this was about some ancient history
thats as laughable as your intel
what went wrong was the joes appearing out of nowhere
he stares at her suspiciously then softens
forgive me jealousy isnt my strong suit
forget that where are we now
have you tracked the case
they deactivated the beacon
i gave them a code to quietly re arm it
mccullen hits a key a screen switches on displaying a map of the world
a beacon light flashes over a spot in the egyptian desert grip coordinates blinking
there it is
the infamous pit
i will get those warheads back
mccullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face his hand going right through her
mccullen whispers menacingly
i hope so
diffusing the threat if i were really there i might actually let you touch me
sly smile ill send a jet
besides im married remember
her holo form blinks off leaving mccullen alone in the room
sometimes i really hate technology
he sighs heavily then hears a voice it is most often used by those without honor
mccullen turns to see storm shadow a well tailored korean man whose soul has long since departed standing on the other side of the room
there cant be any more mistakes
the schedule cant be compromised any further
if you had sent me it would be done
walking towards him im sending you now storm shadow
to the baronesss villa
make sure her commitment doesnt waiver
storm shadow nods mccullen continues on through him
we now realize storm shadow was a holo proj
storm shadow vanishes
mccullen steps up to a large oval perspex window
we pull back out of the window to reveal that hes riding through deep arctic ocean inside a next gen trident submarine
camera keeps pulling back to show the trident approaching the docking bay of a massive facility built into the seabed under the jagged canopy of the polar ice cap
the place is defended by several harpoon cannons and a fearsome turbo laser
its a breath taking sight but also a little frightening
the mars logo is stamped on a pair of water tight doors
the logo pulls apart as the doors open allowing mccullen inside the docking back entrance
waiting for him is a man known only as the doctor
his face hidden by a life support mask that continually pumps air into his lungs and also mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he is missing
good to be back
weve been very busy
he gestures to twenty mercenaries or various ethnicities all standing at attention not a single muscle moving among them
these are neo vipers
the baddest of the bad
is it working
you tell me
the doctor beckons a waiting lab assistant who rolls out a glass case containing an eighteen foot long king cobra
the doctor bends down and gazes at the snake
the king cobra is a magnificent creature
its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite
he rattles the case and the cobra hisses at him revealing its hood
the doctor steps up to a neo viper and shows mccullen an incision scar behind the neo vipers right ears
we introduced into each subject one thousand ccs of the nano mite solution
as expected subjects became extremely ill and fell into a coma like state for approximately forty hours
the doctor produces a small handheld device from his pocket a file photo of a neo viper appears on the devices screen
when they returned to sentience brain scans showed complete inactivity in the self preservation region of the cortex
the doctor keys a demand and that particular neo viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal
they feel no fear
the neo viper grabs the cobra and squeezes the cobra bites his arm latching on sinking its venom into his veins
the neo viper doesnt even wince
cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity doctor
they feel no pain
the doctor keys another command and the neo viper obediently lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case
frontal lobe concepts of morality are disengaged
and they are completely obedient
the real world applications are endless
the neo vipers knees give out
mccullen watches curiously
we smash cut into the neo vipers bite wound where the white venom is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins
the nano mites will target the venom
still in his veins we see hundreds of microscopic non mites rushing to meet the venom head on
then swiftly pushing it back
all the way to the original fang holes
the venom seeps out of the holes and drips off the neo vipers arm
he stands and returns to his place in line without a word
the doctor looks at impressed mccullen
so you tell me is it working
the doctor follows mccullen through various corridors
the science is staggering isnt it
youve done well
youve thrown the caber clear out of the yard
but research and science are expensive propositions
if i can make a suggestion
mccullen stops and looks at him there is something truly menacing and evil behind this doctors mask
selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund i appreciate your thirst for knowledge doctor
but this world is messy enough
factions fighting and scrabbling for control for resources and its only going to get worse as the century progresses
what the world needs is unification
it needs to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control
he looks through a portal into a shadowy operating chamber where a brilliant but vicious looking man is being scanned by smart robots
this is zartan
a smart robot begins to change zartans fingerprints which we see on a monitor
my family was once this close to that kind of power
zartan cracks his knuckles and gives mccullen a nod
mccullen looks back at the doctor
once i get my hands on the reins the money will take care of itself
youll be able to do all the research you want
mccullen strides off
the doctor stares after him
duke still holding the briefcase stares at a photo of ana from the ambush now up on a monitor
we grabbed an image from heavy dutys helmet cam
ripcord looks stunned he leans closer to duke and whispers hey thats duke cuts him off with a look
breaker extracts a full d front view of anas face from the photo
then on an adjacent monitor he runs an endless series of photos of women
now we can run the face through an infinity scan
we have access to any photograph on any server anywhere in the world
everyone gets photographed in some way at some time
atm machines airports crowd shots at a football game
well find her
duke just stares at anas photo
ripcord whispers quietly you okay
not okay what happened to her
for once ripcord doesnt know what to say
cover girl walks in and hands a document to hawk who looks through it
i am now the official custodian of the warheads
your mission is complete
once you hand it over that is
duke nods hands over the case with a hint of defeat
when you move it shes gonna come after you you know that right
off hawks look and with her intel and her toys
shell find you
and your point is
youre going to go after her first
and i want to help
let us in on this general
our team just got wasted
i think a little payback is in order
you dont ask to be a part of gi joe
you get asked
you scouted me four years ago now im ready
lets have at it
ive lost men too captain
but attempting to i know her
you said knowing is half the battle
well i know who she is
duke reaches into his pocket pulls out a photo and shows hawk
insert photo ana four years earlier much softer looking staring lovingly at duke as theyre about to kiss
her name is ana lewis and i can tell you everything you need to know about her until
four years ago
after that well obviously sa lots changed
hawk just stares in disbelief
hawk sits down behind his desk and looks up at duke still standing at attention
before this goes any further i need to know what im dealing with a man looking to settle a score or a man who can put the mission first
because the battlefield is the wrong place for emotion
he pauses for effect could you kill her
if i had to
chances are you will
but if you flinch hesitate even an instant
what im trying to say is unless you can kill her graveyard dead i dont want you
off hawks look i signed on to deliver those warheads general and despite your present authority i want to finish the job
hawk regards him for a moment
so tell me about her
okay ill start right here i hope that vault is tight because she always gets what she wants
a black beefed up suv drives towards a magnificent mansion in the parisian suburbs
though the vehicle looks relatively harmless well come to know it as a scarab attack truck
ana enters the mansion
servants take her coat as her handsome sophisticated and well dressed husband baron leon decobray glides up to her very french
they kiss warmly
how is work at the lab
so the minister of defense was pleased
you know i wish i could tell you more
you were gone a long time
how were the shops in monte carlo
i didnt get what i was after
they head up the stairs
i suppose i should be grateful
most husbands would be
most husbands dont have such mysterious wives they know exactly where they are and what they do
they think they know
ana throws open the double doors to her grand bedroom on a high floor with a view of the eiffel tower
i never get over how beautiful
staring at ana neither do i
she spots storm shadow standing in an ante room and quickly spins to face her husband
she pulls decobray close and kisses him
storm shadow makes a move but ana warns him off with her eyes she finishes the kiss and looks at decobray
let me change and freshen up and ill meet you for dinner
decobray smiles at her and leaves
the smile falls from anas face as she spins around and heads for storm shadow
mccullen gave me explicit orders to sever the barons spine if he so much as touched you
hes my husband of course he touches me
tell mccullen to grow up
besides the baron says his work in the lab goes much better after weve
and thats the important thing
ill be accompanying you to retrieve the warheads this time
along with some of the men the doctors been working on
with distaste the doctor
we go at dawn
storm shadow turns and heads out through the doors
ana stands alone in her room now she heads over to her dresser and opens a hidden drawer
inside is a small box
she opens it carefully and gazes at an engagement ring inside
something sad and lonely in her eyes
and we flashback to a crowded military club
officers and enlisted dancing to an orchestra
and theres ana the most beautiful woman in the room
wearing a black dress
slightly younger and with none of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier
shes dancing with duke whos wearing his officers dress uniform replete with bars and medals
she laughs as duke whispers something in her ear
shes in love
and so is he
ripcord is in a booth downing shots with four enlisted women
he has his arms around two of them and looks loaded
my hot tub only holds four
duke leads ana outside onto a quiet verandah the lights of washington shimmering beyond them
he suddenly kneels down in front of her an engagement ring in a box in his hand
ana gasps with shock and joy tears welling in her eyes
ive been wanting to do this before we deploy
its too nice you lunatic
only time im buying one of these so why not
they stare a each other a touching beat
then duke screws up his face worried
well what do you say
shes too emotional to speak
and then they hear say yes you idiot
lieutenant rex lewis saunters up medical insignia on his collar
the look on his face tells us hes happy for them
before i tell my new brother in law what its like to share a bathroom with you
thanks for killing the mood rex
i was coming to offer you a ride back to post
we go at oh five hundred
is it wmds
it is right
thats why youre pulling rex out of the ana we cant yeah yeah
have to kill me if you told me blah blah blah
speaking of classified information you still havent answered
of course its yes
on one she grabs rex and pulls him down on his knees next to duke
promise me that you wont let my genius egghead brother get hurt
looks at rex hes the only family ive got left
back to duke promise me
she smiles and holds out her hand
he threads the ring onto her trembling finger
rex smiles but in his eyes is a glint of instability
ripcord comes crashing out through shuttered doors and sprawls out next to them arms and legs akimbo
ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors how was i supposed know she was married
then notices the ring nice rock
hey are you proposing
im done proposing
i already said yes
not official until you answer my question
do you love my boy
always and forever
ripcord flips open his cell phone and takes the photo of ana that duke carries with him
now ive gotta find someone to love me as many times as possible for the next three hours
we push in on the photo then smash cut back to the present
on duke watching heavy duty pulling out an accelerator suit
if you want to join us youll need to be mission ready joe style
this is the mark one accelerator suit
whats it accelerate
itll make you run faster jump higher and hit harder than any of your enemies
a titanium boot slides over a shoe
cobalt machine parts snap into place with a hiss over duke and rips arms and legs
head to toe turbo hydraulics and highly pressurized pneumatics
they both slap on aerodynamic flying wing helmets
inside the cybernetic power up with an ear piercing whine
laser enhanced led readouts scramble and fritz across their huds
an advanced cybernetics heads up display feeding into your helmet
duke checks out two gas propelled grappling spears and six wrist rockets around his right forearm
two gas propelled grappling spears and six ten millimeter hi explosive heat seeking fire and forget rockers
rip spins the twin barrels of a caseless submachine gun on his left forearm
a cheshire grin spreads across his face
and a nine millimeter caseless submachine gun with six hundred rounds capable of firing all of them in thirty seconds
duke and ripcord are now buckled in getting a feel for the flexible poly alloy suits
ripcord glances at heavy duty
i just missed everything you said
turns to duke how do i look
pretty cool huh
duke and ripcord run through and urban environment obstacle course d holo projection terrorists lunging out at them
the guys take them out one by one never more than a split second after they appear
the holo projections fritz and die
they reach the end of the and a buzzer sounds
at the back arms crossed impassively taking it all in is hawk
scarlett approaches the guys with an electronic clipboard
sixty three seconds
but not good enough
gotta get under a minute to qualify
whats the record
dont tell me snake eyes
ripcord glances at scarletts crossbow pistol
you can do this whole course with that thing in forty five seconds
if youre going to shoot at something kill it
otherwise take up knitting
when i want something i dont just shoot at it
steps close to her when i get a target in my sights i take it down
his meaning is clear
she holds his gaze slaps a magazine into her crossbow pistol and hands it to him
i wouldnt want to show you up
oh thats so thoughtful of you
what can i tell you
i guess im just a considerate humble guy
youll learn that about me
im the target in your sights right
youve got ten rounds to take me down
i dont want to hurt you
theyre training arrows
the most ill feel is a little jolt
scarlett walks back and faces him
he glances aside at duke who is loving this
ripcord readies the pistol
scarlett darts left
he shoots and misses
she darts right
ripcord tries harder genuinely doing his best
but scarlett us too fast
ducking and weaving around ripcord as nimble as a cat
five more shots miss her
and now ripcords feeling the pressure
he waits for her to move
she leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath
he fires again as she lands ducks under it and rolls up to him
he fires his last bolt point blank
she catches it in her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber
slamming her body up against his
right hand behind his head left hand holding the bolt
their faces close
ripcords eyes on hers as he whispers guess you didnt really want me that bad rip
she holds his eyes a moment longer then lets him go
as she walks away scarlett casually tosses the arrow it hits the ground and explodes
ripcord and duke jump back
ripcord glances at the underside of the pistols magazine
three words caution live bolts
both men watch scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the course awestruck
breaker walks by eating a burrito and watching his bio rhythm display
aw ripcords heart just skipped a beat
isnt that sweet
the sun is sinking turning the dunes a brilliant orange
security works a console in the security room
their infrared monitors show a herdsman and his camels walking across the desert dunes
a technician taps some keys and an x ray image shows the skeletal structures of the herdsman and his camels
the herdsman walks across the desert with his camels under a full moon and a field of glittering stars
all of a sudden multiple mounds of sand whip past his feet almost knocking him over
he stares at them as they abruptly disappear deeper under the sand like diving submarines
ana drives the lead mole pod an oblong shaped digging device that is just large enough for her to fit inside
she watches her hud relay information about her angle of decent and her distance to the target
a light flashes on the console in the security room
sensors detecting seismic activity to the southwest
probably just a tremor but have a team check it
ripcord and the other joes watch as duke and snake eyes circle one another with special electrified pugil sticks
duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move snake eyes side steps it spins his pugil stick above his head and brings it down on dukes head with a sword
a crackling shock is delivered and duke goes down
the joes grimace feeling dukes pain
snake eyes turns away done with him
duke pops back up again
they go at each other fast and furious the electrified pugil sticks crackling and sparking
duke spins and attempts a stroke similar to snake eyes earlier move
snake eyes blocks it drops and sweeps dukes feet taking him down hard before finishing him with another sparking hit
again the joes react
snake eyes turns away
duke shakes it off and pops to his feet once more
snake eyes nods a little more respect in his eyes now
this time after the high blows are parried snake eyes tries the sweep
duke jumps it rolls comes up behind snake eyes and strikes
snake eyes barely blocks it
they trade half a dozen blows the electricity popping and crackling before snake eyes tries a finishing blow
duke stuffs it with his stick and tackles snake eyes
they fall to the ground both receiving jolts
they go eye to eye
it wasnt pretty but duke is getting effective
snake eyes pops to his feet
this time he offers a hand to pull duke up
across the room hawk watches with approval
the huge drill bit of anas mole machine bursts out of the reinforced clay wall it opens and retracts ana rolls out and drops to the ground
another huge drill bursts out it retracts and opens and storm shadow drops to the ground
they look around
theyre between the clay wall and the electrified power grid fence of the pits generator station
the foundation of this fence is a hundred feet deep
no going under
ten neo viper mole pods start to burst out the wall
and then theres a crashing sound as one of the wall girders bends obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it
ana can hear the engine grind to a halt
if we dont get him out hell suffocate
storm shadow gives her a look like i care
just thought id mention it
all that matters is the mission
ana pulls out a hi tech scanning device which shoots out six steel blue beams in a degree arc creating a detailed schematic of the pit showing rooms and people
moving about them
she points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence
storm shadow gestures to one of the neo vipers
the man immediately walks over and grabs the fence electricity jolts him violently but the man ignores it and shakily starts climbing the fence
the skin on his hands and arms starts to burn and bubble
acceptable collateral damage
trying to out tough him is there any other
near the top the man finally falls backward and drops down dead
storm shadow nods to the next viper
without hesitation the man walks over and grabs the fence
he is immediately jolted but keeps climbing burning and bubbling
this guy makes it to the top throws himself over and crashes to the ground then crawls over and pulls the off switch cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself
ana storm shadow and the others quickly scale the fence
an area where the joe team chills
duke and ripcord enter sore and worked over
they move to some couches
heavy duty grooves to the blasting reggaeton classic salio el sol
you can learn a whole hell of a lot about a girl by the way she dances
tell me im wrong snake eyes
snake eyes sharpening his sword barely looks up
no he doesnt
this time snake eyes looks up his expression unreadable
see he knows you have to listen to get to know someone
rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear glances over
you say something
breaker sits at a chessboard
heavy d sits across from him
sorry scarlett gotta go with heavy d on this one
like my man says get a girl on the floor you dont just see how she moves you get the smell of her
what biologists tell us is that the decision is made by he nose long before the rest of the body gets involved
its a question of pheromones
youre going to teach me science
i read all about the positron emission tomography studies concerning sex pheromones when i was twelve
im just saying its not very romantic
rip whispers to duke nodding towards scarlett
heavy told me she graduated college at twelve
no response from duke who is trying to get comfortable
shes like a freaky genius
a deadly freaky genius
you like her i get it already
making a chess move you cant learn this stuff in a book scarlett
you have to at least kiss a guy before youre an expert on romance
the guys all laugh
scarlett blushes then raises her bow
who am i shooting first
the laughter stops
rip looks surprised
you havent kissed anyone
now scarlett looks really furious
rip instantly wishes he could take his words back
duke just shakes his head
really firing on all cylinders there rip
all i know is when the bass gets that booty shaking in the right way im in the skin like a man named flynn
heavy duty does a little freak dance
scarlett makes a show of disgust
ripcord watches scarlett then makes a decision
hell with it
he strides across the room toward scarlett
to no one in particular into the valley of death rode the
heavy duty looks at him confused
breaker nods to ripcord stopping near scarletts chair
ripcord sees snake eyes taking in his every move
scarlett now has her nose in a book
ripcord clears his throat but she doesnt look up
he peers closer and we see the cover on which though in english is a damn near indecipherable scientific title
beach reading huh
she groans and lowers the book only slightly
hi i guess we kinda got off on the wrong foot
without changing expression she goes back to her book
okay look im attracted to you
and you youre attracted to me
and him nods towards snake eyes the zen master he creeps me out but what im saying is were attracted to one another
thats what youre saying not what im saying
okay what are you saying
attraction is an emotion
emotions are not based in science
and if you cant quantify or prove that something exists well in my mind
okay ill get back to you on that
and he walks away scratching his head
hawk steps in
everyone comes to attention
duke you scored in the top half percent of all people weve ever tested
rip well if we average your scores with dukes you pass too
welcome aboard provisionally
but we still need to see if you pass muster in the field
hawk gives them a nod
duke and rip nod back with pride
welcome aboard boyz
ana storm shadow and the neo vipers creep down the hallway
two gi joe guards come around a corner before they can even react storm shadow practically cuts them in two with his katana sword
ana directs them down another hallway
a door reads general hawk
cover girl walks up and knocks
as she waits we see a shadow moving behind her
hawk opens the door
she hands him her powerbook and a
sorry to disturb you general
thats all right cover girl
what am i signing now
cover girl gasps a katana blade piercing out through her chest
she drops lifelessly revealing storm shadow behind her
hawk grabs a pistol but storm shadow flashes his two swords
one slices the barrel of the pistol clean off the other buries itself in hawks gut
ana steps forward and rips the generals security badge off his jacket
hawks eyes follow them as they leave
he glances at a red button under his desk and struggles to reach it giving everything hes got until he finally hits the button
a klaxon blares
duke ripcord and all the joes leap up
they all rush out of the doors
breaker stops to change a chess piece on the board before racing out
ana swipes hawks security badge across the lock of the vault door
the weapons case sits on a table
she opens the case to check that the four warheads are inside they shine on her glasses
duke and ripcord reach the main vault armed only with their pistols
they find the inner vault door ajar
they approach pushing back the door to discover that the place is empty and the weapons case is gone
they cant be far
some of the neo vipers now reach the mole pods and begin prepping them for escape
a grenade slams into them killing them and destroying the pods
its heavy duty with his mpl
ana enters the room and quick draws her pulse pistol and blasts away
heavy duty dives behind cover which is blown away knocking him out cold
storm shadow examines the ruined mole pods glancing around his eyes falling on a pair of arclight jet packs mounted on a wall rack nearby
storm shadow strides to the nearest one and puts it on
ana heads after him still carrying the case
suddenly duke and ripcord rush up behind them guns raised
put the case down ana rip trains his gun on storm shadow
and you get out of that
storm shadow doesnt move
ana turns and looks at duke
sets the case down her voice is gentle
then she takes a step toward duke
stop right there
but she doesnt
she just keeps slowly moving toward him
you cant shoot me can you
i will if i have to
deep down youre still the same man i fell in love with
dont force this ana
what could have been right duke
you beside your best man
me walking down the aisle
dont listen to her duke
a thought was i really going to be your best man
cocking the pistol dont make me do this god damnit
dont make me do this
a recurring theme in your life right duke
she takes another step
duke levels his pistol right at her forehead
storm shadow flinches
duke gives him a glance
move and ill blow her away
to ripcord get the briefcase
ana takes another step forward daring duke to pull the trigger
ripcord gun drawn and fixed on storm shadow moves slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase
ana is now an inch from the extended barrel
ana and duke are close enough to feel each others breath
their eyes lock
do it duke
you already killed me once
and in dukes eyes we see him falter just a bit
ripcord passes ana and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at dukes pistol
an errant shot goes off
storm shadow lunges at ripcord slicing his pistol in half with one sword and about to kill him with the other
when suddenly snake eyes lunges into frame
snake eyes katana blade saves ripcords life by a half inch
the rest of the neo vipers arrive and immediately open fire pinning both duke and ripcord down
all hell breaks loose
snake eyes and storm shadow lunge at one another swords flashing at impossible speeds then they lock swords
face to face staring hard into each others eyes
snake eyes glances at storm shadows right forearm spotting the same red markings of his ninja clan underneath his suit sleeve
this shocks the hell out of snake eyes
storm shadow smiles
snake eyes looks shocked
storm shadow uses the moment to elbow him in the face knocking him hard to the ground
ana grabs the weapons case as scarlett rushes in aiming her i believe youve got my luggage
ana stares at scarlett then quick draws a pulse pistol
her shot tears the crossbow pistol out of scarletts hands
anas got her dead to rights until scarlett triggers her camo suit melting into nothing right in front of ana
ana doesnt spot the ripples of air around her until shes stuck hard
the case goes flying
another smack and her pistol is knocked free
ana grabs a second pistol but thats just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped
ana fights the invisible scarlett as best she can but scarlett lands several unseen blows on her
ripcord and duke take out a pair of neo vipers
storm shadow climbs back into the arclight
looking at ana as she falls near a vehicle on the blocks
ana grabs an oil pan and flings the oil which sprays over everything including scarlett making her visible
ana leaps on scarlett knocks her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of her
storm shadow ignites the arclight which jumps into the air powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine pack
he quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana by her arm pulling her along
ana grabs the weapons case and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing pad
the battle raging below them
ripcord and duke fire after them but they vanish up into the next level
heavy duty now back in action takes out the last of the neo vipers
snake eyes checks on scarlett whos nursing her neck
ana climbs to storm shadow as the rocket up to the security room window and blast it out of their way
they fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few technicians still alive
ana his the large switch on the console and the huge door begins to spiral open
she jumps back into storm shadows arms and they blast back out and fly up through the hole where their typhoon gunship rockets up
they fly in through a door as four joe anti aircraft turrets spring out of the sand firing away at the typhoon as it speeds away into the dark desert
dawn light shimmers across the reflecting pool the lincoln memorial the washington monument
the american president quickly but quietly closes the door to his bedroom throwing on a robe he charges down a corridor trailed by his staff and bodyguards
one of the staffers hands the president a report which he skims through
how many warheads
none so far sir
we take this to mean the terrorists are unfocused no clear goals
the president stops glancing gravely back at his staff
it means theyre going to use them
ana mccullen gazes a the iron mask we and storm sh saw his ance adow watc in the h onndual holostor this belonged jo e mine
he was c t an old ancestor o f to both sides
aught sellin g arms they forced wear it the rest to his life
why do you keep at it

mccullen carefully puts the mask back in its ca se

then to test pon one
i want you test one
ana i dont wan t you until leaving paris that theyve you re sure that the work been properly y weaponized
well let cnn show everyone how w ell they perform
loses the smile i want them to fear me
it will be storm shadowdone
i have a target french will never in mind one the forget
as i have never forgotten what the french did to clan mccullen
in the shadowy operating chamber the doctor approaches zartan who sits on a gurney scanning his pda
dozens of smart robots warm up as the doctor flicks on switches
are you ready mr
this is going to be the achievement of a lifetime
for you and me both
eighteen months of studying the subject learning the mannerisms adopting his eating habits losing sixty percent of my muscle mas
your commitment has been inspiring
about to get under way
zartan raises his pda
once the ledgers are all square
check your account
zartan checks the pda
mccullen shakes his head
its always about the money
its a useful tool
you should understand that
the transfer just hit my account
zartan puts the pda aside leans back on the gurney and
lets do this
the doctor straps zartan down then starts the smart robots which converge on zartan injecting his body with dozens of long needles
he remains conscious not feeling any pain
we zoom into a large needle which opens an incision behind his right ear
the needle feeds thousands of tiny nano mites into zartans head
zartans eyes bulge he starts to scream and fight his restraints as the nano mites begin to reshape his appearance reforming facial bones and changing the texture and elasticity of
his skin and even changing the color of his eyes
the doctor grins proudly
mccullen looks disturbed
joes are busy cleaning up the mess
snake eyes sits by himself hasnt moved in several hours
a thousand yard stare in his eyes
and we flashback to a ten year old french orphan boy cold from the rain and desperately hungry scavenges for food in a garbage can he looks up and notices
a warm light coming from the other side of a wall and gate marked with red clan markings
inside the temple young snake eyes sneaks in through the kitchen window and goes to a rice pot on the counter
as he takes a first bite another young boy enters we see the red clan markings on his forearm its a young storm shadow healthy wealthy and well fed
he picks up the kitchen knife and tries to cut young snake eyes who blocks the strike with the rice pot
they fight fiercely for two little kids using all sorts of utensils and furniture
snake eyes has desperate street skills but storm shadows classic training gives him the edge
he finally traps snake eyes under his foot a triumphant look on his face
he starts to choke snake eyes with his foot
japanese subtitled enough
a ninja master steps forward
storm shadow turns to him
japanese subtitled father he was stealing
we need to call the magistrate
japanese subtitled he is hungry
we need to invite him in and show him the way
hes a cur
he doesnt fight like one
the two young warriors glare at one another
japanese subtitled now what shall be your clan name
snake eyes glares up at storm shadow narrowing his eyes furiously
hard master just smiles ahl and we flash back to snake eyes in the motor pool he stands up and walk off
battered and bruised scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks
checks around to see that shes alone
then she heads for a mirror over one of the sinks peeling back her collar to check the choke marks on her neck
her hands are trembling
she turns on the water and cleans her face with a wash cloth
ripcord enters the barracks behind
like scarlett he looks around to see if hes alone
he catches scarlett looking at him in the mirror as if hes unwanted
then he notices the choke marks
he is genuinely concerned
jesus you okay
youre not fine let me look at that
i looked at it its fine
take it easy just trying to help
i know what youre trying to do
and what is that exactly
i dont have time for this
you know not every guy you meet is an asshole
you do know that dont you
scarlett stops and returns to the sink he ignores her cleaning the blood off his face
its not you i
i didnt really want anyone to
see me in here
i dont know
all the people we lost last night
my neck is not that important
you almost died
youre allowed to be concerned
first fight ive lost since i was a kid
my father would be
he was my instructor
think hes be disappointed
he taught me to win
i dont know how you teach anybody to win at everything every time
but i do know you can teach someone to get up when they get knocked down
ripcord turn her gently in the mirror
look at you
maybe this is what he wanted you to learn
scarlett stares at her reflection briefly
but of course that would be an emotional response one that cant be explained or quantified
ripcord turns and heads for the door
scarlett watches him
were not a couple
snake eyes and me
close hes like a brother but
were not a couple
ripcord looks back at her nods then walks on out
hawk is hooked up to a life support machine
duke sits nearby his shoulder being bandaged by a medical officer
we push in on dukes eyes staring into oblivion and flashback can you kill her
and then we flashback to ana strangling scarlett a smile on her face
squeezing harder harder
that ought to hold you
duke comes to as the doctor finishes and walks away
duke takes a breath looks to hawk in his bed then stands and walks over
he stares down at hawk then a promise graveyard dead
duke ripcord scarlett snake eyes and heavy duty stare at some next gen computerized ultra sound photostats of a dead neo viper
snake eyes points in question to an area
i wrote my thesis on the theory behind them at oxford
theyve been surgically implanted behind the ear all programmed to accomplish different tasks
theoretically the possibilities are endless
increase their speed agility resilience
you program they perform
thats the genius of nanotechnology it can do pretty much whatever you want it to
i dont see why not
duke and ripcord move with the others through a corridor
their weaponry financing intel it has to be mccullen
doing an inside job on his own warheads
you may be right
maybe he needed nato to pay for his r d
the weapons case
everyone stops and looks at ripcord like hes nuts
remember he had us open the case for him
what about it
ill bet that code he gave us like re activated the tracking beacon or something
looks pass among the group it starts to make sense
and who says youre not a thinker
all of the sudden breaker rushes up to them out of breath
i think i found her
breaker leads the group into the control room where a wedding photo of ana and decobray is up on screen
duke stares at the photo gazing at her face
ripcord sees her and knows too
yeah you found her all right
her name is ana decobray now baroness if youre feeling formal
wow she traded up huh
off dukes look i mean
who is he
big shot french scientist
runs a lab in paris
breaker call up an image of decobray standing in front of a huge particle accelerator along with some other scientists
theyre gonna use him to weaponize the warheads
thats where shes going
who likes croissants
and then a lighted aircraft in the distance approaches at mach three
its the howler
the joes are silent eyes ahead
scarlett shares a smile with ripcord next to her across from them duke watches almost smiles then lays back his head and closes his eyes
and we camera pans around a village choked by thick jungle as explosions erupt in slo mo and a blackhawk circles rotors beating hypnotically giving the images a dreamlike quality
duke ripcord rex and the rest of an insertion team sit with their backs against the chopper walls
per the briefing we fast rope in form up and assault the main lab
a glance at rex rex uh
the science officer stays back with fireteam alpha until bravo enters and secures the building
alpha holds the perimeter while science officer secures the wmds
five minutes before extraction and the airstrike
the squad nods
duke looks to rex again
rex is sweating trying not to show it
duke hands him a piece of gum
rex takes it
duke blows a bubble smiles at rex
always helps me
weak smile back yeah
they chew their gum
down in the village duke leads a frontal assault of the main building
they take fire from some guards but put them down
other guards flee
the way to the door is cleared
duke gives hand signals along with his commands
bravo a two man fire team hit the door of the building
they disappear inside
rex a kit bag over his shoulder and a
colt acp on his hip waits in a crouch duke next to him puts a hand on his shoulder
duke scans the treeline for any treats
one of bravo team appears in the doorway and signals all clear
duke double taps rex on the shoulder
youre good to go rex
you dont find it in four minutes get out of there because that house wont be standing in five
i already called for the air strike
duke gives him a smile
rex takes off and runs low to the door entering the house
duke watches him go then looks back to the jungle and hears the whump of mortars
duke takes one more look rex disappears safely inside then the mortar rounds start to hit
the ground is torn apart dirt flying in the air as duke rip and the rest of the squad takes cover
we catch glimpses of the enemy lots of them in the jungle firing
duke and ripcord pop up and return fire
ive gotta level with ya
i hate it when you level with me
gonna be a long five minutes
duke just grits his teeth and keeps firing
then in the distance rumbling coming from the sonic roar of jets
i love that sound
but then he looks to duke confusion on his face
no no no
its too soon
angle on the f s in formation streaking toward them across the sky
duke looks back at the main building
duke runs for the building
tracer fire and mortar explosions all around him
then the whistle of a bunker buster
duke dives and boom
the building is flattened by the bomb
duke is tossed through the air like a rag doll
lands hard barely registers the pain staggers up bloody and ripped stumbles toward the smoking
flaming rubble that was the building
the blackhawk comes sweeping low ready for extraction the tracer fire and explosions intensify
black smoke washes over duke
ripcord finds him in the debris
come on weve got wounded
and incoming enemy
lots of em
nothing you can do
gunfire bursts around them as ripcord pulls duke away from the ruins of the house
tight on dukes haunted soot streaked face as his eyes take on a thousand yard stare
and we cut back to the present duke is wide awake his eyes have on a thousand yard stare
paris by day the eiffel tower in all her glory
anas scarab attack truck pulls up to a guard shed outside a large building which is surrounded by an electrified fence
a security guard steps out of the shed and taps on the drivers window
the neo viper behind the wheel lowers the backseat window revealing ana and storm shadow in the back
the guard smiles at ana
they speak in french subtitled
my husbands expecting me
the security guard opens the electronic gate and the scarab drives up to the building
two security guards look up from their desks as ana and storm shadow stride through the doors with two neo vipers
storm shadow throws something
both guards fall dead
throwing stars in their heads
the neo vipers steal behind the desk throw a switch open a locked door for ana and storm shadow
ana and storm shadow enter a colossal chamber which is all but consumed by the particle accelerator
lab technicians swarm all over it taking readings and making adjustments under the eyes of decobray who sits at a control station surrounded by monitors
ana gives the weapons case to storm shadow who hangs back as she walks up to her husband
i need you to do something for me and i dont have much time
sees storm shadow who is this
she beckons storm shadow who sets the weapons case down on decobrays desk opening it up to reveal the four nanotech warheads and their launchers
decobray stares bewildered
i dont understand
what are these things
whats going on
theyre warheads dear
and i need you to weaponize them for me
looking around or well kill everyone in here
decobray stares at her shocked
he looks at storm shadow who removes a glock pistol from his belt and shoots a technician
decobray shouts to the room calming the others somewhat
he stares at ana and storm shadow terrified
this is a civilian laboratory
we dont have the correct programming protocols for weaponizing
the protocols are in the case
he hesitates i told you i dont have much time
decobray reluctantly takes the weapons case
a brawler charges through the streets
on the outside it looks like your uncles r
v but inside its all next gen
heavy duty drives the brawler while breaker mans a hi tech terminal next to him
in the back snake eyes loads his guns while scarlett duke and ripcord put on accelerator suits
heavy d and breaker will stay in the brawler watch our back
the rest of us will break into the lab with the accelerator suits
once the warheads are weaponized theyll be extremely volatile
we cant afford to let any of them go off inside the city
ripcord looks at snake eyes
what about you
dont you get a suit
snake eyes just looks at him are you kidding me
he doesnt need one
a tremendous whine echoes through the chamber as the particle accelerator come to life humming evenly
storm shadow backs up a little
ana glances at him
he shrugs what
technicians quickly finish up and back away from the accelerator
decobray hits a switch
the particle accelerator charges and begins hurling atoms through miles and miles of underground tunnels
inside the accelerator the four warheads begin to spin in a glass vacuum chamber then as the power grows they begin to rise each one hovering as they spin
ana and storm shadow watch with mild curiosity as the noise inside the chamber builds
the atoms catapulting faster and faster through the tunnels bombarding the warheads again and again
until finally a loud boom rings out
and the warheads slowly sink back down and stop spinning
decobray keys another button and the glass vacuum chamber emerges from the accelerator
technicians open the chamber and very carefully remove the warheads returning them to their case
storm shadow locks the case and picks it up
thank you leon
i think i have never seen the face of evil until i looked at you now
ana looks at him and falters something in his words piercing her hard veneer
she feels storm shadow watching her and with a flick of her eyes the walls go up again
she drop a sealed envelope on decobrays desk and heads for the door
decobray watches her go then opens the envelope
we see the large header printed on the first page accord de divorce
the brawler races up towards the lab they see it out their forward windows
there it is
ana and storm shadow emerge from the lab and climb into the back of the scarab as the two neo vipers climb in the front
decobray stumbles out to the foyer finds the two security guards dead and quickly picks up a phone
the security guard in the guard shed puts down his phone and glances at the oncoming scarab just as a neo viper leans out with his pulse rifle and blasts
the whole shed to pieces
the scarab crashes right out the gate
at the same time the brawler reaches the laboratory and theres a split second where both sides see each other in their windows
duke and ana lock eyes
snake eyes and storm shadow do the same
snake eyes is already moving lunging out a side door onto the street as the brawler still moves running right at the scarab which turns to get away
scarlett immediately follows him out landing in a roll with her accelerator suit
ana leans out of her window and fires her pulse pistols at the brawler keeping duke and rip inside
then she fires at snake eyes and scarlett
snake eyes dives but the blasts nail scarlett
she crashes hard
snake eyes glances at her
with that he leaps after the scarab just grabbing the back of the vehicle as it tears away
the brawler stops right next to scarlett out of breath her accelerator suit to duke and ripcord dont worry about me go and help snake eyes
duke doesnt need to be told twice
he leaps out and runs after the scarab
rips starts to follow breaker grabs him
theyre worth millions of dollars
millions of dollars got it
he promptly trips and crashes to the pavement
picks himself up
gets hit by a car
picks himself up again
to driver sorry
excusem moil to a stunned breaker wont happen again
then rip hauls ass after duke
an accordian bus passes casually through an intersection
all of a sudden the scarab bursts through it ripping it in two and barrelling on down the busy street
snake eyes is still barely clinging to the back
breaker watches the two halves of the bus whirl around on his satellite view as heavy duty drives through the city streets
christ they just shot right through a bus
duke and rip charge after the scarab
their speedometers reading mph
they leap over and around speeding cars and trucks
the scarab smashes through any vehicle in its path leaving a trail of destruction for duke and ripcord to leap over or dart around in their suits
ana and storm shadow hear snake eyes on the roof and drop their windows and lean out and shoot at him
but snake eyes quickly clambers down the side of the vehicle escaping their shots by disappearing beneath the undercarriage
and thats when ana sees duke and rip following
she sits back down inside and keys a button on a console
side panels slide open on the outside of the scarab to reveal two missiles one on each side
the missiles streak back towards duke and ripcord
no time to get out of the way they dive and roll in various directions extreme kinetic energy hurling them forward
the two missiles whip between them and detonate one on a parking officers car and the other on a billboard
the explosion from the car knocks them down
the scarab tears away around a corner
they see snake eyes on their monitors in the brawler
theyre turning the corner
go through that building at oclock
duke and ripcord see the building in front of them
theres no door
duke charges directly at the building
ripcord reluctantly following as duke smashes through the wall into
a crowded bar
neither of them slow for a second
duke bolts through
rip grabs a martini opens his visor downs the drink then places the empty glass on the tray of a stunned waitress
behind her a sign reads drink responsibly
duke and ripcord smash through the opposite wall
back out onto the city streets where they turn and level their wrist mounted rockets at
a puzzling beat
and then the scarab thunders up behind them at full speed
ripcord dives out of the way just in time
duke has no such luck
he spins and catches the front grill digging his feet into the road in an attempt to slow the scarab down
but the scarab now angles towards a busy intersection threatening to crush duke in the criss crossing traffic
duke throws himself onto the hood just as an suv crashes into the front grill and is chucked away like so much garbage
duke tumbles up onto the roof
a pulse cannon pops up
duke dives off the back as the weapon fires
he tumbles to the pavement as ripcord speeds up to him firing his wrist mounted rockets at the scarab
duke fires with him
their rockets nail the scarab and knock out the pulse cannon
but its armor saves the vehicle
inside storm shadow and ana are knocked around
storm shadow pops a hatch and grabs one of their own accelerator suits
hands it to ana
mccullen would be quite unhappy if i let you die
ana quickly and nervously starts to buckle in
on the monitors scarlett and breaker watch the scarab via snake eyes speeding through the streets
look at the moves theyre making theyre heading somewhere
breaker widens the map plotting a route
thiss their route from the lab
on the screen they see the lab the current position of the scarab and what lies just ahead
the eiffel tower
snake eyes is now desperately clinging to the undercarriage
duke and rip are catching up behind him
guys you have to stop them
yeah were working on it
i mean right now
theyre going to detonate one of the warheads on the eiffel tower
ripcord glances up and sees the eiffel tower looming up fast
under the scarab snake eyes pulls out his glock pistol and fires into the unprotected insides of the front tires which promptly rip to shreds
the neo viper loses control of the vehicle smashes through a guard arm onto train tracks
snake eyes sees something lets go rolls free and crashes into garbage cans just as a metro train barrels into the scarab which launches into the air hood over tailpipe
duke and ripcord are running too fast to stop
duke manages to leap into the air his boots barely scraping the top of the train while ripcord covers his face with his hands and plunges headlong into a window
on the side of the train
flying across the aisle whipping past a group of stunned morning commuters and smashing out through the far window
the scarab duke and rip all crash hard to the pavement and tumble
sparks and flame and flying metal everywhere
duke and rip finally stop tumbling a hundred yards away from the wreck of the scarab
scarlett heavy duty and breaker see this on their monitors
you guys okay
duke and ripcords visors lift both looking a bit wigged
what happened to you
i went through the train
what happened to you
i jumped over it
you can do that
yeah you didnt know
inside the scarab we see the neo vipers are dead
storm shadow is incredibly beat and bloody but ana is just fine in her red accelerator suit
storm shadow grabs the weapons case and he and ana leap out
duke and ripcord pick themselves up while snake eyes crawls out of the trash cans nearby
they see storm shadow and ana emerge from the scarab and hurry off towards the tower
snake eyes follows duke and ripcord charging after them
hundreds of tourists swarm around the south base of the tower to buy their tickets and start their tours
storm shadow and ana burst through them slamming past security guards as they bound onto the stairs
people scream at the sight of ana
duke and ripcord arrive seconds later rushing up in their accelerator suits like beings from another world
they spot ana and storm shadow on the stairs and hurry after them
the security guards draw their pistols and start shooting at duke and ripcord
the bullets ping off their suits
to duke how do you say were the good guys in french
meanwhile snake eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up under the south base scaling the iron lattice like a monkey
on the first floor ana and storm shadow crest the stairs and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the opposite side of the floor
another security guard draws a gun on them but storm shadow snatches the weapon out of the mans hands swatting him with the butt all without missing a step
the crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs where duke and ripcord are struggling to catch up
the avalanche of tourists slows their progress
underneath the stairway however snake eyes continues to climb fast without a safety net
he makes it to the first floor and races after ana and storm shadow
on the ground the brawler screeches up
scarletts first out with breaker and heavy duty behind her
all of them carrying weapons
the security guards instantly go on the defensive as they hurry up to the stairway
guns go up
scarlett speaks to them urgently in french
french subtitled dont shoot
were a special anti terrorist unit
theres a bomb up there
police cars are now rushing up behind them
on the second floor ana and storm shadow speed over to the main tower elevator and barge their way inside
storm shadow hurls the elevator operator out as ana opens the weapons case and removes one of the nanotech warheads and its kill switch
through the stunned crowd they see snake eyes reach the top of the stairs behind
ana rolls the warhead towards him while storm shadow lines up on him with the security guards pistol as if to shoot him
snake eyes glares defiantly at storm shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the warhead
a single shot and the warhead explodes
snake eyes recoils
on the ground everyone hears the warhead detonate
on the first floor duke and ripcord freeze
on the second floor a burst of nano mites spreads out in all directions
storm shadow closes the elevator doors and hits a button for the top
the elevator races upwards as everything else gets eaten by the ravenous nano mites
the floor begins to disappear
tourists stampede towards the stairs
a little girl is thrown from her mothers grip
the mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the railing
on the first floor a hundred feet up duke and rip see her coming
ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in time
above them the tower is dissolving before their eyes
duke sees snake eyes being pushed down the stairs by the tourists
he leaps up onto the iron lattice
where you going
each warhead has a kill switch
its too late
we gotta get off this thing
those nano mites will level the entire city
duke climbs up the side of the tower with his accelerator suit
rip things about following but then looks at the little girl in his arms who smiles and hugs him
snake eyes grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs
the nano mites chasing them close behind
below them scarlett breaker and heavy duty are helping the police evacuate the tower
inside the elevator ana and storm shadow race to the top
into mike be ready to pick up in thirty seconds
in the skies the typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of the disintegrating eiffel tower its side door opening
on the tower duke scales the tower the nano mites chasing him up
his eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck just above him
the typhoon fires a blast of its concussion cannons at duke knocking him off the tower
he falls but manages to catch the tower just below the nano mites almost on top of him now
the climbs even faster
on the top deck the elevator arrives
ana and storm shadow calmly walk out and climb the railing as the typhoon hovers up beside them
below them duke sees them board
the tower groans and wobbles
its a long way down
time has run out
ana and storm shadow jump into the typhoon
with the nano mites at his heels duke clambers up and jumps up off the side of the tower sailing up through the air and latching onto the side door
of the typhoon
in the typhoon the gunship rocks with his sudden weight
ana and storm shadow almost lose their footing
duke springs inside
he smacks storm shadow down and grabs the kill switch from ana pressing the trigger
immediately the nano mites pulse with light and fall to the ground around the eiffel tower
the tower groans half eaten then topples over on its side
ripcord and snake eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes down onto the seine sending up an enormous explosion of water
the shock on the faces of everyone around reverberates through the entire joe team
ripcord keeps his eyes on the typhoon as it pulls away
breaker suddenly gets an idea
he hauls ass
ana looks at duke a pursed smile on her lips
you just saved paris
storm shadow is not happy at all he tasers duke who drops hard to the floor of the typhoon
a crowd has gathered around the crashed scarab
heavy duty yanks one of the dead neo vipers out
breaker yanks off the guys helmet then removes a needle like port plug from his surveillance suit
scarlett moves into position to help him
ripcord kneels down
what are you doing
plugging into his cerebral cortex
with a sickening crunch breaker plunges the needle into the top of the neo vipers head
ripcord winces at the sight
the brain survives for a couple of minutes after death
we can read his most recent memories
can you find duke
if this guy remembers the way home we can
insert a flash of memories appearing on breakers hud
duke shooting him in the face racing along the highway driving the armored car
as the images continue we push in on the neo vipers open eyes and cut to mccullen watching breaker and ripcord through the dead neo vipers eyes on a screen
he turns to the doctor urgently
destroy that unit immediately
the doctor removes his pda and taps a key to draw up the neo vipers file
he clicks a button that reads terminate
instantly the neo vipers body snaps rigid and begins to shake
everyone gets a shock
hes still alive
hes not alive
you ever seen a dead guy do that
they activated a self destruct
the neo vipers body starts to decay before them
thousands of nano mites literally eating away at his flesh and bones
theyre eating him
but the nano mites are too fast
the neo vipers legs are now gone
his chest and arms next
breaker rapidly scans through the memory flashes
but now the nano mites consume his head
mccullen watches breakers frantic face suddenly disappear on his screen
he gives the doctor a smile
breaker looks crestfallen at the empty neo viper suit in his arms
ripcord kneels beside him stunned and bereft
you did the best you could
relax i got it
you got it
well what was the noo
that was for mccullen
there is the sound of weapons being raised
the team looks to see they are surrounded by french police and paratroopers
in french put your hands in the air
the joes trade looks shrug and raise their hands
under his breath we dont have time for this
scarlett its agains friendly for t orders to engage with ces
the onl about i dukendly force i care ripcord suddenly s forces heads
some hit the prays a burst of crashes through t deck
gunfire over the french to grab him he french line
ripcord charges and though a dozen paratr forward and he fights they take oopers opers manage we smash cut to a him down hard
the joes sit alone french police holding cel who bears some bruisbenches
duty stares at ripcord nice
itsnot his emotional
scarlett and a french detect rip share a look
on the other suit o curiously examines n a desk
bre aker jumps up to breakerssde rf the bars the bars
please breaker touch that
please dont touching its very
sir how do ripcord you say lawyer in french
if we could get on a might be to computer we longitude able input the partial les g es latitude and viper figu the downloaded from tha t re out
their locati to ripcord itll be a military when theyre done tribunal
need a lawyer
we with us and ll need diapers
to himself think think think
to the joes at some point they gotta feed us or take us out for the interrogation
when they do ill jump the lead guard
heavy you go for his weapon and start an international incident
im not gonna just sit here
this is bigger than duke
what if it was one of you
what if they had heavy or scarlett what would you do
the joes trade looks rock and a hard place
were not doing duke a damned bit of good sitting here
if it was reversed duke would be kicking down every door between here and the freakin moon til he found me
and well do the same for him as soon as we get out of here
she has a thought and turns to breaker
you said partial latitude and longitude
we only got the one coordinate degrees then the image went to snow
maybe it was the whole coordinate just degrees latitude
they all look at her
before the image went to snow
its the polar ice cap
rips dog tags hit the floor and slide to his feet
the joes all look up to see several police officials looking at them
the joes are led down a hallway
they did away with the guillotine right
they arrive at a door
the door is opened to reveal a man in a wheelchair back turned
when he spins around its hawk
hawk just shakes his head and sighs heavily
the joes sit around the general mid discussion
how long before were released
the french government is allowing you to leave on the condition that none of you ever return
other agencies will be handling this from here on
the heads of state of every member of gi joe are recalling their operatives
we are now considered a rogue unit uncontrollable
were to report to washington for debriefing
hawk rolls his wheelchair to the door
theyve got duke
hawk stops his wheelchair turns to them
i said you were to report to washington
i didnt say when or which route to take
maybe a northern one
hawk smiles and wheels out the door
a night raven rockets through the orange skies smashing through the sound barrier with an ear tingling sonic boom
storm shadow sits in a meditative state
duke is shackled hands bound out of his accelerator suit
ana steps out of the cockpit area and approaches him nods to storm shadow
he thinks i should kill you
why dont you
james wants to meet you in person
ana listen talk softly or hell tazer you again
raises his bound hands loosen these hell never taser anything again
she taps the bonds on his wrists
i shouldve thought of this before
they almost share a smile
let me get this straight
youre with mccullen
youre married to that baron
and you claim youre still in love with me
im a complex woman
maybe you just dont know who you are anymore
who i was died long ago
no this isnt you i still see the person i loved behind your eyes
her eyes soften for a moment
tell me what she was like
she was smart and funny
she was loyal as hell
she loved those she was close with me her brother
agonized pause i did my best
he was my responsibility
i should have
its why i left ana
why i couldnt be with you
you were in so much pain
i thought the sight of me just give you more
she seems to be affected by this ever so slightly then
a hard cold look comes to her eyes she shakes her head
it doesnt matter now
no it matters very much
we have the chance to make things right
nothing will ever be right again
duke stares at her his heart ripped apart
we push in on the two of them and flashback to rain is drizzling on a military cemetery
ana sits alone without family without duke staring straight ahead as rexs casket is lowered into the ground
parked on a nearby road is a lone car
duke sits inside it staring at the funeral in the distance
his face tells us the anguish hes living with
he pulls out and starts to drive away the rain on the windshield blurs as we dissolve the night raven zeroes down on a stretch of ice near a huge
a set of runway lights appear under the ice guiding it in for a smooth landing
the cave swallows the plane whole
the night raven rolls to a stop inside the cave
the side door opens
storm shadow exits with the weapons case
ana leads duke out two neo vipers behind them
storm shadow clicks a hand held remote and a hidden ice wall opens to reveal a hi tech diving bell awaiting them
duke uses the moment to lunge forward grab the case and haul ass towards the cave door
storm shadow spins shurikan throwing stars in his hands
the neo vipers whip up their pulse rifles
mccullen has plans for him
storm shadow throws a star it whistles across the cave and nails duke in his shoulder duke goes down hard staggers back up but the neo vipers are already on
him they start beating the living shit out of him
ana jogs up
storm shadow picks up the case and looks at duke face down bloody and beaten
and what was your plan
run three thousand miles across the ice
he rips his star out of dukes shoulder
duke sucks it up
duke rolls over and stares up at them breathing hard
ripcord scarlett snake eyes heavy duty and breaker are in the conn tower of a next gen submarine going over a d map of the polar ice cap
thats a lotta ice
its gonna be like trying to find whale spit in the ocean
breaker sees a small light flashing on his ball eyepiece
when they stole the weapons case i set my suit to scan for the tracker beacon in case it came back on and it just came back on
ripcord just smiles
thats my boy
the diving bell comes shooting down out of a shaft in the bottom of the ice cap and rockets down towards the facility
as the diving bell descends duke stares at the facility out the portal
he is awed by the immense size of the place he looks at ana proud of her office
certain work needs to be done away from the public eye
the diving bell entry port opens guarded by two neo vipers
mccullen stands waiting
his eyes first move to the weapons case in storm shadows hands
storm shadow opens it and shows him the three remaining warheads
mccullen runs his fingers over them then nods storm shadow closes the case
take them to the drones
i want them ready to launch in one hour
it will be done
and only then does mccullen greet ana
my beautiful lady of the lake
he kisses her
ana kisses him back with slightly feigned affection her eyes open and on duke
duke stands there impassive
mccullen finishes the kiss and turns to duke
this bother you
duke says nothing so mccullen steps closer
isnt it funny with the entire balance of power in the world about to shift a couple of guys can still have a stare down over who gets the girl
duke takes the opportunity to head butt mccullen
the neo vipers instantly pummel duke to the floor
mccullen wipes a small trickle of blood from his nose
the interesting thing about my neo vipers is they still think the same thoughts they always did they just cant act on them anymore
instead they do what i want
i imagine that must be very frustrating
he gets right down in dukes face
im going to make you very unhappy
grit teeth im already happy
mccullen glances at ana watching the display with conflicted eyes
mccullen heads for the door beckoning the neo vipers to make duke follow him
duke trails behind mccullen and ana flanked by neo vipers
whatre you gonna do with the warheads
you take to your training well thats good
still trying to develop information
still planning to escape and stope me
moments from now youll see that wont ever happen
then you wont mind telling me
isnt it clear
im a business man
im going to use them
millions of people are gonna die if you launch those warheads
what is it you want mccullen
merely to strike fear into the hearts of every man woman and child on the planet
only then will they look up to the man who wields the most power and obey him
the control room is alive with technicians squirreling about various stations
monitors show three large aerial drones sitting in vertical launch bays
duke sees the drones and his face registers the horror of what mccullens about to do
he glances at ana she quietly looks away a hint of remorse in her eyes
the doctor rises to greet mccullen glancing at duke for several moments as if struck by the sight of him
meet the genius behind all my nanotechnology
my genius lies only in taking what others created to the logical next steps
all modern gains in science are made through theft
youll have to excuse his modesty when i found him he was interrupting re duke another recruit
albeit a rather unwilling one
the doctors nano mites can control all manner of brain functions
when you wake up youll be working for me and your past will be a distant shimmer that floats in and out of your mind like a leaf on a
ill prepare him for the surgery
the doctor beckons the neo vipers who shove duke after him towards another door
duke and ana exchange one last look
mccullen keeps his eyes on her as she watches him go
a school of fish swims past the facility one fish breaks away from the school
camera zooms in tight on it its not a fish at all but a mini robotic underwater spy system
a sleek submarine drifts silently through the arctic waters
pictures coming on line now
in the conn tower of the sub our team gathers around breaker who sits at a monitor watching what the fish is watching
its an underwater facility
mccullens home away from home
dukes gotta be in there somewhere
wait whats that
breaker zooms in on a massive turbo laser cannon
thats an automated phased array turbo pulse battery
off their looks a really big gun
could it take out our sub
that thing could take out a dozen subs simultaneously
then thats our first objective
dukes our first objective
the main force cant attack as long as that cannons online
how you figure getting it offline
snake eyes points to the diving bell cables n the monitor
theyve got a surface entrance
she turns to the submarine commander hector shipwreck delgado a fiery spanish naval combat veteran
going up senorita
scarlett nods and leads the others down a corridor
snake eyes breaker ripcord and i will infiltrate the factory from above and destroy the cannon
heavy d as soon as we give the word you lead the assault from outside
nods grimly go joes
a quiet wind blows across a remote stretch of arctic ice
all of a sudden the ice pack begins to tremble like the mother of all earthquakes
it cracks and ruptures and then erupts as the conn tower of the submarine crashes through then grinds to a halt
a forward hatch opens and two rock slides launch out landing hard on the ice and speeding away
ripcord and breaker on one
scarlett and snake eyes on the other
mccullen ana and storm shadow watch monitors showing technicians securing the warheads onto three rocket propelled smart drones
as the last one is secured a technician says all drones prepared and ready sir
good commence the launch sequence immediately
is that a ripple of concern flickering across anas face
our team races into the ice cave on their rock slides and park beside the dormant night raven
scanning the place from top to bottom
ripcord stars at the awesome plane towering before him
that mccullens got some gadgets
breaker gestures to the ice wall
snake eyes uses his katana sword to slice a circle in the wall and yank it out revealing the diving bell cables but no diving bell
maybe we could slide down
snake eyes shakes his head doubtful the arctic water would kill us
mccullen ana and storm shadow watch the drones sitting in the launch bays on the screens
technicians are working hard
ignite primary engines
the entire control room begins to shake
the screens fill with fire
the joes run outside wondering what the hell is causing the earthquake
a large circle of ice near them melts
and then the first drone explodes up before them and launches into the morning sky peeling away to the east
before they can react the second drone explodes up a hundred yards away peeling off to the west
they hear the third one about to rocket up
snake eyes thinks fast sprints into the cave jumps on a rock slide hauls ass outside hits a weapons switch on his rock slide prepping two heat seeking rockets on
either side of the vehicle
the third drone launches up from two hundred yards away
snake eyes locks onto its exhaust and fires
the missiles race up after the drone and knock it out of the sky
the technicians see this on their monitors
we lost one
what do you mean
bird three is down sir
mccullen looks at the monitors enraged
storm shadow smiles
were under attack
alert all defences
charge up the pulse cannon
he turns to say something to ana but she has left the room
topside the team watches the two remaining drones race away
what about the other two
we find the kill switches and short out the nano mites
shakes his head theyre already way out of range
then somebody has to go up there and shoot those things down
ripcord climbs into the night ravens cockpit
scarlett steps up to watch
hes already flipping switches and putting on a can you even fly this thing
i can fly anything
you just track those warheads and guide me in
we dont have long until they hit
he glances at her a moment between them
then she presses forward and kisses him on the mouth
he stares back at her
do me a favor
she gives him a nod then leaves
ripcord grins to himself
the night raven tears across the ice and launches into the sky
ripcord whoops with adrenaline
scarlett snake eyes and breaker fast rope down into the first launch bay as the ice reforms behind them hiding the hole
we now find duke wearing only surgical trousers strapped on the operating gurney we saw zartan on earlier
the smart robots warming up around him as the doctor approaches
the atomic bomb that was dropped on hiroshima destroyed seventy percent of the city
did you know that duke
duke looks at him something familiar
there was a bank situated less than one hundred yards from ground zero destroyed of course
only one thing survived
its four bank vaults
and when those vaults were opened they discovered everything inside them had survived completely unscathed
who are you
of course the vault i took shelter in wasnt that well made
he unclips his breathing tubes and lowers the mask to reveal a scarred and burned face
duke is beyond shocked
rex immediately has trouble breathing and returns the mask over his face
ana buried you
a moving ceremony im sure
the three volley salute
the flag on the coffin
why didnt you come in
because i found out the truth
rex moves through the building with fireteam bravo
intel says the labs in the basement
fireteam bravo kicks open a door
they lead the way down a staircase toward the basement
rex follows nervous as hell
the soldiers round a corner suddenly rex hears gunfire he freezes then silence rex pulls out his
and rounds the corner to see fireteam bravo down
a guard is trying to clear a jam in his machine gun
as he clears the weapon and raises it rex raises his
and fires first
the guard drops
rex checks bravo but theyre not moving
he looks around the basement no lab but he sees a massive vault door closed
he heads for the vault raised breathing hard
whoosh a blast of refrigerated air hits him as he opens the door
rex enters a small room filled with dead animals in huge formaldehyde jars something inside the animals is constantly reshaping their appearances reforming their facial bones and changing the color
texture and elasticity of their skins
there is a scuffling noise rex points his gun
a small stooped old scientist in a lab coat appears
are you going to shoot me
rex doesnt respond
we knew you were coming
but i couldnt walk away from it
rex stares in awe not what he was expecting
stay where you are
his gun up he finds a computer terminal and begins accessing various files starts reading them
these arent chemical or nuclear no
this is beyond anything
this is light years ahead of anyone in the field
you see why i couldnt leave
rex nods hypnotized by the science in front of him an instant bond formed with the man who created it
the distant sound of jets
the scientist moves to the vault door and begins pulling it closed as we hear the j dam bunker buster whistling towards them
if we live ill show you everything
duke tries to absorb what hes learned
the doctor continues
the man who created this technology was not our enemy
in fact he was hired by our very own government to create it
when it was deemed too unethical they sent us to kill him
he didnt survive the blast
touches his face and i escaped with his research
unfortunately i tested it on myself first and lost my lungs and vocal chords in the process
but now ive perfected it and you will get a first hand experience
his biggest concern does ana know about this about you
and she never will
he glances at the smart robots and duke realizes
you sick bastard
you did this to your own sister
i loved my sister
do you have any idea the state she was in
so i had her brought here gave her a way to deal with her pain gave her purpose
made her strong
i gave her a new life duke
why work for mccullen
he saved my life for starters
now to mention infinite resources to work in the field of my choosing
you could have had any job you wanted
i didnt want any job
you cant play nice with science duke
its sometimes necessary to experiment to fail even to destroy to attain a goal
its a fact that mccullen has the guts to embrace
still shocked everything shes done everything shes become started because she thought you died that day
and because you then abandoned her lets not forget that part
and with that he leaves duke to the smart robots which menacingly begin to move in
scarlett snake eyes and breaker drop down into the launch bay
they see a chrome corridor leading into the facility
its pressure plated and laser protected
anyway around it
any object larger than a quarter will fry your britches
snake eyes shakes his head with a sigh then steps forward and leaps onto the floor landing on his fingertips
then with incredible strength he proceeds to walk across the floor on his fingertips aware of the continuous crackle and hum of lasers around him
scarlett and breaker watch with baited breath
snake eyes now reaches the doorway
what youll have to do is rewire the laser panels brain by snake eyes swiftly balances on one set of fingertips while his other fingers grab his sword and stab
the laser panel
the sound of the laser net instantly vanishes
or you cold just stab it
duke lies on the operating table as a smart robot makes an incision behind his right ear
a long needle zeroes in on the incision
as the needle dives towards dukes head a hand hits a switch and the needle quickly retracts
duke looks over to see ana by the controls gazing at him
i dont have much time
she rushes over and unties him and they stare at each other then kiss passionately
all of a sudden duke feels something behind her right ear he turns her head an incision scar
he looks at her but before he can say anything anas body snaps rigid and falls limp in his arms
duke looks over to see the doctor holding his pda mccullen and two neo vipers beside him their rifles on duke and ana
duke gazes at ana desperately feeling for her pulse
two technicians man the firing controls of the huge turbo laser cannon
snake eyes takes them out and shuts down the cannon
he sends a quick message on his wrist communicator
heavy duty sees the message appear on a screen
cannon off line
have a nice day
heavy smiles and turns to shipwreck
lets get in this fight
the gi joe submarine peels around a rocky headland now in full view of the underwater facility
a series of torpedoes fire out of the submarines launch tubes
most are blown up by the facilitys harpoon cannon defenses but several manage to hit the facilitys exterior
the whole place shudders
scarlett and breaker blow the control room door and cut down the technicians trying to shoot them
breaker takes over a station console
okay ive got a lock on the two remaining warheads
target one is moscow
target two is washington
give ripcord the coordinates
snake eyes spins to see a pair of katana blades come crashing down at him from behind
he spins but one of the blades cuts him on his left arm sending him reeling backwards its storm shadow
who quickly powers the laser cannon back online
snake eyes dives to stop him and as their swords meet we flash cut to the grounds of the arishikage temple where two sixteen year olds snake eyes and storm
shadow trade blows with wooden katanas
storm shadow drops snake eyes who falls hard storm shadow steps on his throat sword point in snake eyes face
hard master looks on without expression
flash cut back to the control room where snake eyes and storm shadows blades flash like lightning they battle fiercely around the room
a neo viper charges up the controls
snake cant stop him
outside the massive turbo laser swings wildly towards the submarine and fires
a brilliant blue pulse ripples through the arctic sea glancing the side of the vessel
the submarine shakes hard
water pours in
the hulls been ruptured
everyone into the attack boats
hatches open along the sides of the submarine deploying ten sharc attack craft carrying dozens of joes
at the same time batches begin to open on the facility and a dozen mantis attack craft carrying dozens of neo vipers emerge
heavy duty and shipwreck pilot one of the sharcs
the huge opposing force coming at them is quite terrifying
keep tight everybody
he fires a harpoon torpedo which blasts a mantis
the mantis craft return fire
the whole area explodes in a pulse fire and harpoon blasts
the joe submarine sinks and explodes at the base of the facility
duke cuddles dead ana clearly emotional
mccullen steps up
is she still alive
you said this couldnt happen
i didnt think it could
ive never seen anyone defeat the programming even momentarily
duke recovers and angrily grabs one of anas pistols and kills the two neo vipers then turns the gun on the others
the doctor lifts his pda finger on the terminate button
if i press this ana dies
put it down
your choice duke
put it down
the doctor doesnt move
mccullen watches the stand off his right hand discreetly drawing steel hose out from his sleeve
ripcord streaks into the upper atmosphere in the night raven the curve of the earth visible out his windows
ahead he can see a pulsating light
i see it dead ahead
breaker speaks into his headset
you have to knock it down before it re enters the atmosphere so the nano mites dont reach the ground
ripcord flicks a switch and opens a pulse laser on the nose
uh ive got a problem
the fire controls are not in here
what do you mean not in there
i mean i cant see them anywhere
scarlett hears this and realizes
its gotta be voice activated
you have to say the words into your flight helmet
ripcord lines up the missile in his sights gets a lock
nothing happens shoot
still nothing blast away
still nothing the missile streaking onwards towards the earth
they hear ripcord yelling over the speakers
must be a different language
to ripcord try teine
its scottish for fire
ripcords not sure about this the missile arcing down
listen to my voice teine
nothing happens its not working
thats because youre not saying it right
how many different ways you want me to say it
the right way
and at last the pulse laser fires
blasting the missile out of the sky
the cloud of nano mites floats aimlessly away
they all see the missile disappear on their screen
nice work ace
you just saved moscow
ripcord sighs with relief already peeling away
just doing my job
guide me to the other drone
under his breath man i freakin saved moscow
the white house glistens in the midday sun
the american presidents bodyguards rush him and his staff down into a fortified bunker beneath the white house
how soon will it strike the city
seventeen minutes sir
this will be a disaster the likes of which we have never seen
as the doors close behind them we see the mars industries logo on the doors
another blast from the turbo laser destroys a sharc
heavy duty sees this as he takes out a mantis
that cannons going to kill us all
my guy will take care of it trust me
snake eyes kills the neo viper who falls down a large shaft into freezing waters
storm shadow lunges at snake eyes and the two of them tumble down into the shaft but land on a gangway
they both leap up and begin to fight again
the neo viper tries to crawl out of the freezing water seemingly unfazed as he slowly freezes solid
all of a sudden theres loud noises and a series of energy lasers power on up and down the shaft between various circuit modules
this is where the energy is charged to operate the cannon
one of the lasers catches storm shadows shoulder and burns him severely
snake eyes sees this and ducks just as an energy laser fires on beside his head
outside the turbo laser fires
the joe craft desperately weave and dodge
and the laser net fades
instantly storm shadow and snake eyes continue their desperate fight
swords flash and clang two masters at their best
and we flash cut to the grounds of the arishikage temple where two twenty two year olds storm shadow and snake eyes sword fight
storm shadow knocks snake eyes to the ground again and places his steel sword against snake eyes face
again hard master watches without expression
and we flash cut back to the energy shaft where storm shadow slashes snake eyes across the chest but before he can finish him off the cannon charges up again
and the laser net slams on
storm shadow twists his body to avoid the energy lasers while snake eyes lifts himself up to his toes to avoid a laser that threatens to disintegrate his crotch
storm shadow sees this grins to himself
a staffer is on the phone looking up at the president
it seems somebodys shot down the warhead heading for moscow
as he says this a secret service agent draws a silenced pistol and kills the other agents and staff
we see an incision scar behind his right ear and realize he is a neo viper
the president stares stunned and horrified
the neo viper holds his pistol on the president as
a bookcase moves on the wall revealing a secret room
an unseen figure emerges and the president stares in shock
up in the skies ripcord spots the second drone rocketing down towards the lower atmosphere in front of him
second drone in my sights
breaker and scarlett watch in the control room
youve only got thirty seconds before it enters the lower atmosphere
ripcords feeling the pressure
he targets the missile
but nothing happens
scarletts voice yells in his head
dont yell at me
ripcord takes a breath stealing his nerves
a red fuel light starts beeping on his control board
rip does his best to ignore it focusing on the missile as it begins to disappear into the lower atmosphere
the light beats faster and louder
the laser pulse fires blasting straight at the missile which is lost in the atmospheric haze below
for a moment he cant tell if he hit it or not
the tracking in the control room provides the answer
the warhead has entered the lower atmosphere
ripcord realizes this as he enters the lower atmosphere himself
the spread of washington d
far below him now
in the operating chamber the stand off reaches its boiling point now
mccullen slowly approaching duke who keeps anas pistol on the doctor ana still in dukes arms
did you think she loved you
did you imagine your life with her
i said stay back
dont you know youve lost duke
all i know is that neither of you deserves her
mccullen suddenly lifts the steel hose in his right hand a burst of flame tears out at duke who reflexively fires the pulse pistol at it
the intense air blast from the pulse pistol catches the flames midway between them and blows them back onto mccullen
mccullen screams as his face is literally burned off
the doctor freaks and drops the pda then yanks mccullen out into the corridor
duke fires after them then grabs the pda removing anas screen with a sigh of relief
above washington ripcord guns his aircraft after the falling drone
getting real close this time
no way he can miss
they see this on the screens in the control room
youre too close rip
ripcord gets eerily calm all of a sudden
actually i think im just about close enough
the pulse laser fires point blank
the missile explodes right in front of him
ripcord flies through the flames the cloud of nano mites latching onto his wings
the drone disappears from their screens now
ripcord is now struggling mightily with his controls as the nano mites swiftly eat his plane
his fuel light flashes at him alarmingly
he angles the night raven upwards giving it all hes got nano mites everywhere
they see his plane angle back up into the upper atmosphere
hes taking the nano mites back up into the upper atmosphere
the night raven is breaking up all around ripcord now
he quickly attaches his flight helmets breathing mask
ripcord turns the plane over inverting it
the canopy explodes
rip shoots back down into the atmosphere as the nano mites devour the night raven then float away
they see this on their screens
he did it
he actually did it
talk to me
and now they begin to suspect the worst
then i asked you not to yell at me
relief comes rushing back to scarlett and breaker
are you okay
yeah did it work
yes it worked
ripcord smiles parachuting down towards washington
into headset good
cause i think im about to get arrested
ripcord lands on the white house lawn holding his hands up benignly as dozens of secret service agents surround him
energy lasers pulse on again almost catching the two ninjas in their fight
snake eyes draws his katana sword its blade shimmering in the laser light as he redirects the laser back into its module
storm shadow does the same with his sword barely saving his neck
they glare at each other
and we flash cut to the arishikage temple where the two year olds fight with katanas
storm shadow presses forward snake eyes side steps and hurls storm shadow to the ground
he steps up and puts his sword tip in storm shadows eye
snake eyes first ever win over storm shadow
hard master claps one time
storm shadow looks at his father he cant believe it his father seems happy for snake eyes
he slaps the sword away gets up and stalks off
flash back to the cannon fires and the lasers disappear freeing them to continue their duel
this is it
the final duel
snake eyes struggles exhausted and wounded
storm shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left
he finally tears snake eyes sword away and kicks him down
about to go for the final kill
but before we find out the climax to their fight we must finish their story on the arishikage temple grounds snake eyes still walks along the pond
he hears a loud cry
snake eyes breaks into a run careens around a building and sees hard master slumped on the ground a sword in his back
other ninjas come flooding in
thats storm shadows sword
theres the murderer
snake eyes spins to see storm shadow climb up the side of the temple onto the rood give him a last look and jump down over the wall
flash back to the energy shaft where snake eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy he stares up at storm shadows katana blade poised for the final kill
you took your vow of silence to avenge our master
but now you will die without a word
the loud noise gears up again distracting storm shadow for just a beat
snake eyes uses the moment to catch storm shadow with his feet holding him up for a split second as the energy lasers come back on
one of them burns deeply across storm shadows neck he screams and stumbles back and falls over the edge and down into the freezing turgid waters
snake eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces
father always feared it would come to this
explosions begin to rock the shaft now
snake eyes stumbles towards the exit leaving his fallen sword brother behind
heavy duty sees the cannon return to its dormant position
turbo laser is down
he guns his engines firing at a mantis attack craft
heavy duty howls with delight
around him the joes begin to turn the tide of the battle
a series of shots of mantis vehicles getting nailed by joe harpoon cannons
they feel the explosions in the control room
screens short out
water starts to cascade in through bursting rivets
energy overload in the phased array battery
power subsystems are going critical
lets get out of here
scarlett grabs breaker by the scruff of the neck and hauls him out of the room
mccullens face is horrifically burned as the doctor helps him down into the trident
explosions blowing above them
the pilots guide the sub out white the doctor starts injecting mccullen with nano mites
mccullen starts to scream
scarlett and breaker races into the diving bell entry port and are shocked to find snake eyes already here
scarlett runs up and gently hugs him
snake eyes grimaces then looks scarlett in the eyes
she knows who he means she gives him a grim smile
and thats when they see duke carrying ana charging up to them
another explosion makes them all dash into the diving bell
the doors close and we hear them launch
heavy duty notices the trident escaping out of the exploding docking bay into the arctic water
he angles towards the sub
we got a runner
cut him off
all of a sudden the whole damn facility explodes
inside the diving bell our heroes are rocked by the blast then they see massive chunks of polar ice plummet down from the ice pack above cutting off heavy duty
and the joes and demolishing the remainder of the facility
the trident disappears behind the trillions of bubbles and falling ice
shipwreck checks his targeting scanner
all other targets neutralized
the trident is moving fast through the water somewhere
mccullen turns to us and we see that the nano mites have created a form fitting mask all over his face
he catches his reflection in the portal and he grabs at the mask the nano mites twisting with the contours of his muscles to reveal his complete and ever lasting
he breaks down falling to the floor then he recovers and looks up at the doctor
i guess i should thank you doctor
the doctor is busy fiddling with his hand held pda
i want you to call me
looks at mccullen and from now on ill be on a first name basis with you destro
mccullens silver face goes blank
duke watches ana through a two way mirror
she sits alone in a holding cell
a military scientist watches her with duke
physically shes fine
but without the correctly coded kill frequency we cant short them out
theres nothing you can do
only the man who put them in there has the correct code
duke considers this carefully staring at ana
duke walks along a prison corridor with ana led by two prison guards
she carries a small bundle of prison gear
ill visit you
i wont be here long
youll be here for the rest of your life ana
she looks at him her face softening
after all ive done
you cant save me
its too late
a beat passes between them
ill visit you
and for a moment she appears to crack
but then a sinister smile creases her mouth
you know this has only just begun
she touches his face then the prison bars slam shut between them
she holds his eyes a moment longer then the two prison guards lead her away
duke just watches her go his face torn with pain
he walks off alone
general hawk is in his wheelchair still recovering from his wounds
he leads duke and ripcord to the howler
with gi joe reinstated would you boys like to stay on awhile
what do you say rip
ripcord looks at scarlett who throws him a wink and a smile
they all laugh
rip steps up to her
so how do you feel about this
i feel very
duke smiles and the joes climb aboard as the platform rises
a bevy of secretaries and staffers greets the president
then he enters the oval office and closes the door alone he looks around walks behind the desk and grins as he sits as if this is the first time
hes ever done this
with a little flair he cracks his knuckles and we realize this is zartan
and we smash cut to black and roll credits
