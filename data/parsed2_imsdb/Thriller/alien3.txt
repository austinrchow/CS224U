alien iii screenplay by john fasano story by vincent ward john fasano march but how will you die when your time comes narcissus since you have no mother
without a mother one cannot love
without a mother one cannot die
hesse a pinpoint of light appears
unseen bellows blow
the embers glow
the fire grows
heated by the furnace to over degrees fahrenheit
flickering flame casts dancing shadows on wooden walls
coarsely grained wood
moisture blasted out by years of intense heat
patched with new wood it too now old and dry
billows up the walls
hangs as an angry black cloud amongst the rafters and beams of the vaulted ceiling
almost obscures on a narrow ledge twenty feet about the glassworks floor
his clothing is medieval
a rough textured cassock
he is a monk
louvers are set into the wall
he angles them open
the smoke begins to escape
the monk turns raises arms and leaps from his lofty perch gently gliding down to the floor with the aid of a flowing fox a primitive hand held pulley that
runs down a rope
he lands next to the glass furnace surrounded by by their dress
with blowing iron and pontil
they blow and shape the molten glass
crack off the finished pieces
the old way
black skinned early fifties
stirs his five foot long blowing iron in the molten glass but he is watching something else
it moves him to song
lilting tenor lifts high into the air
this is brother kyle
well would he guess the ascending of the star wherein his patients fortunes settled were
he knew the course of every malady were it of cold or heat or moist or dry
brother john would be doctour of physick
we see the object of his song not yet forty
strong features but fear behind the eyes
the fear that comes from a lack of inner confidence
a good face nonetheless
he stirs a thick mixture in a mortar
next to him another monk sits holding his arm out in front of him cassock sleeve rolled up revealing a vicious burn
tend you quickly he will with bottles from a shelf
but heals not so easily the ills which plague himself
brother john stops stirring
to kyle enough
he scoops the salve out with his fingers and applies it to the burned monks arm
the burned monk inhales sharpley as the cool mixture contacts the injured area
to the burned monk relax
to kyle put those lungs of yours to better use
yes doc tor
kyle laughs removes the blowing iron from the molten glass a blob of white hot glass hanging on the end
he rolls the blob on the marver a flat polished piece of iron then begins to blow a bottle shaped container
john wraps a fray edged cloth bandage around the burn
keep this from getting wet
go home at late afternoon mealtime and dont come back to work today but john ill tell the abbot
just rest today
youre lucky you only burned yourself on the side of the furnace
if some of that glass had gotten on your arm he points to the top of his forearm
it wouldve burned clean through to the other side
he mimes a drop down from the bottom of his arm
the burned monk shudders at the thought
thats late afternoon
now get on
thank you john
i youre welcome
the burned monk trundles off injured arm against his chest
john gathers his mortar pestle and extra bandages into a burlap sack
kyle comes over
all right but im no father anselm
youre yourself thats better
kyle pushes him through the door
the hallway is alive with cassocked monks
their low chanting reverberates throughout the building
the wooden floorboards creak beneath their combined weights
this is obviously a medieval monastery
the abbot will be pleased
please dont tell him
at least until i know if theres an infection
you want to be the abbeys physician and you havent learned the first rule dont worry about the patient
johns face drops
i shouldnt have
look i know how you must you dont but thanks anyway
a wide stairwell
a constant stream of monks all moving down the stairs
coming from floors above
headed for lunch
kyle starts down
john starts up not coming down
i have someone waiting for me
kyle disappears into the crowd
john moves up
a river of brown cassocks running downstream
john is the only one moving against the flow
he exits the stairwell a narrow corridor lined with doorways
john moves to one in particular
he doesnt even look as he grabs the door knob
this is his room
he opens the door an old worn out dog lays in wait on an old worn out cassock which is now serving as its bed
at the sight of john it stands
come on mattias
the dog mattias joins him in the hall
monk and pet disappear up a flight of stairs
past another dozen or so monks who are on their way down
a vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches between aisle after aisle of floor to ceiling wooden shelves jammed to capacity with books of all shapes
millions of books from the looks of it
from each book hangs a long chain long enough to allow the book to be carried only as far as the nearest table
in his fifties and the librarian by his stern affect his position behind a broad but also old oak desk and the large key hanging from his belt
he watches the few stragglers return their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door then rises and joins them
john leans against the wall as philip exits
mattias is nowhere to be seen
feeding the mind instead of the body again
my training has taught me to feed whats hungry
philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway
as did mine
as long as youre alone
enjoy yourself and remember no book leaves the library
how could i forget
have a good meal
john watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs
when hes gone from sight john lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal mattias
they move into the library
the oldest books
john moves to the stacks
mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits
this is his regular place
john stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient tome
he runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding
a smile plays across his lips
he carries the book places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain
sits on the bench next to the dog
clears his throat opens the book begins to read
john reading in the year of our lord i brother gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury the abbot and my sixty fellow monks sometimes i think youd like that
john turns to find leader of the monastery
in his seventies but looks younger
his cassock is adorned with a large ornately carved wooden chain in place of a rope belt
he crosses to the table
john closes the book and stands head bowed in respect
john abbot i i didnt think anyone would mind
just philip if he knew
i passed him on the way up
he said youd come in alone
i knew better
he scratches the back of mattias neck
how are you boy
the dog snuffles in response
you know what philip says about mattias hair and his breathing
youll have to take him out of here
he likes when i read to him and i cant john looks down sheepishly
though nearly forty he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the abbot
the abbot pulls a large key from his pocket
smiles someone must have left this one unlocked
take the book with you
he hands the key to john who is shocked this is a great honor
kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today
ill reserve judgement until the patient lives
john crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book
he returns the key
it will get easier
father anselm was
an unexpected loss
youll do fine
the abbot walks towards the door
just have it back before the end of lunch
oh and i didnt see you in here
to mattias lets go upstairs boy
john takes his book moves to a spiral wooden staircase
mattias at his heels
goes up the mechanics of the bell tower all ropes and wooden cogs cast scary shadows
a doorway leads to thick with sandy dust
the wood shows through thin patches
we pull back to reveal what we think is the roof of the abbey is actually the door has opened onto the surface of a plantoid
the curving horizon broken only by the very top of the abbey bell tower poking through from the levels below
smoke curls from vents set into the surface
sunken areas of the planets sirface are seas
this is arceon
an manmade orbiter
a shell of lightweight foamed steel five miles in diameter
constructed by the company on special order with habitable level within finished in whatever material suits its end user
this orbiter for reasons to be discovered later has been sheathed in wood
walks to the shore of an inland sea
sits on a bare patch of wood
his eyes grow accustomed to freckled with tiny dots of light
spread across the inky void
bathe arceons surface with their celestial glow
john smiles at mattias breathes deep
the atmosphere up here is thinner but fresher
he opens the book
reads aloud in the year of our lord i brother gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury the abbot and my sixty fellow monks day by day one by one
until i am the only one left
i stayed as long as i could bear it then with my dog mattias lifts his ears at this part
his favorite part
i have put this to parchment lest this pestilence this black death stay my hand
beat this was finished by another hand
john closes the book
something catches his eye something among the myriad points of light in the sky
millions of miles away brighter than the rest
fast enough to leave a faint trail
across the stars
watches growing brighter
joined by three other monks
they are older than he
the four men watch the sky
they come up through the planets surface
out of wooden trap doors
join the others
now three hundred
necks bowed back
a subtitle identifies
population exiles crime political heresy fills the sky
burns brighter still as it hits the planetoids atmosphere
hundreds of monks shield their eyes as the ship the star roars over their heads
trailing fire john holds up his hands to touch a star skin blisters as it passes over him he turns and watches as it arcs downward plumes of steam rise
into the air
the water boils
fish bob to the surface
is the first to hit the shore
small leather and wood fishing boats tossed by the wake
his coracle is the first into the water
the others running up behind him
he cannot hear the shouts of warning
the sun cracks over the black water
johns hands move the rough wooden oars
blistered palm opens
he tears off a piece of his cassock rips it with his teeth wraps the bloody hand
sulaco escape vehicle rocks on the water
white metal skin blackened by the heat
rows right into it
his coracle pitches in the choppy surf
he scrambles onto the ships cracked tile surface
teeters balances moves to the unmistakeable hatch
looks around for a knob a handle a small panel door whose black and yellow stripes denote urgency
john hesitantly opens the door revealing a shiny metal lever
he stares at it
then quickly pulls it down
hull door opens
the doorway is a black maw
john crosses himself
begins to lower his foot into the hatch watch it
he almost falls backwards off the ship
looks back are rapidly approaching
kyle gestulates wildly john
dont go in
john turns back to the open hatch
machine recirculated air flows out
he feels it on the skin of his face
cool and artificial
it calls to him
he steps in
swallowed by the blackness the door closes behind him
dim red lights
john stands still as his eyes adjust to the darkness
he sees a glass and metal coffin pneumatic piping twines around its base
the glass lid is broken
a small red light pulses at the head of the tube a soft voice and tone like your seat belt warning is audible
sotto seal broken
john finds himself moving towards the tube
looks through the broken lid there is a splattered blood stain on the sterile white interior
old turned rust brown
whatever happened here happened a while ago
rust colored drips trail down to drag marks
his eyes follow the stains to a pile of bloody clothing against a control panel
the head of childs doll but no body to be found
looks back towards the door
part of him wants to get the hell out here but he fights back his fear
he is a doctor or trying to be someone in here may need his help
he presses forward averts his gaze from the clothing up to the blinking and glowing instrument panels and their myraid pressure lights
thousands of lights
like the stars in the sky
its been decades since hes seen technology like this and never this close up
he steps further into the ship his fear now replaced by fascination follows the lights
led numbers race
a legand identifies elapsed since separation
he moves on
through scanning bars of snow an image a woman with a young girl standing in front of her
the womans arms are wrapped around the girl
the woman speaks
her message repeats itself
a tape loop although john has no idea what that is
taking pod four
the crew of the ss sulaco and all marine commandoes are dead
ships sensors have interrupted the hyper sleep cycle
an overlooked alien egg has hatched
bishop and hicks have been killed
xenomorphs have infested the cruiser
newt and i are taking pod four
the crew of
the warning tone of the womans message rekindles johns fear
he moves more hesitantly around the periphery of the ship following the trail of blinking instruments drawn to touch a button
just an oxygen mask
john feels his rapidly beating heart as he pushes aside the plastic dangling object and continues around the shuttle
his hand brushes over a sensor which responds by lighting and a blast of freon shoots out of an overhead pipe john shouts and back up into next to newts
now empty tube
john approaches it cautiously
he can make out the occupant through the lid
the woman from the screen
this is ripley
wearing a white cotton tank top and boxer type shorts
christ she looks beautiful
john looks from ripley to her image on the monitor then back
sinks to his knees reverent
fascination has replaced fear again
moves his face closer to the lid
closer to hers
daylight spills in johns head whips towards the source of the light open
kyle and the other monks
john what is it
is this a supply ship
kyle theres someone in here the second monk looks at kyle
this is forbidden
just get the hell out of there i dont want to stay
i have to get her out before this sinks
you come in give me a hand her
look this is not the supply ship so this is technology forbidden to us
get out of there now
john looks down at ripely
a keypad is mounted at the head of the tube
a red button emerg open thats plain enough
all right he presses it
the tube opens with a loud blast of compressed air
the monks at the door recoil at the sound
ripley has been lowered into a large coracle
john holds her in front of him
her head lolls as the boat rocks on the waves
the monks start to row back to short
reverent a space ship
even more reverent a woman
you shouldnt have gone in im supposed to be a doctor
he pushes ripleys hair away from her forehead
she couldve been lost
been a long time since i saw either
it isnt sinking
look at it
what are we supposed to do with it
what was it like in there
so many lights tow it in
bring it in
its just technology
look at these fish the abbot will know what we should do with it just lights
just look at the fish
the abbot will know
these fish are boiled
thousands of lights
like the stars
like heaven on earth
ripley stirs in johns arms
fights to come out of her fugue state
looks around through half lidded eyes she is surrounded by rowing cassocked monks
she closes her eyes
tries to clear the imagine
opens theyre still there
she looks down at the bloodied hands around her waist realizes shes sitting on someones lap
looks back over her shoulder he smiles at her
friendly not sexual
shakes her head
tries to speak her lips form soundless words
she looks over her other shoulder sees bobbing on the surface
growing small with each stroke of the oars
fights the cobwebs in her brain
tries to focus on the ship remembers
turns to john tries to speak wait
she loses consciousness
streaks of light move across the darkness
form patterns of light and shadow against the wooden walls
there is a sublime stillness but coming through the walls are the muted far off sounds of the abbey the sawing of wood
we move down off the wall to a hand made wooden bed
ripley in restless sleep
the waters grown rough with the approach of night
wind whips across white wave tops sprays the dozen monks who lash their boats to ripleys ship with thick hemp ropes start to tow it to shore
ripley is sleeping but struggling against some unseen foe she tries to sit up cant
tries to shake off the effects of the suspended animation
looks up through half lidded eyes sits next to her
hands swathed in white bandages
book resting on his lap
she squints to make the figure standing in the shadows behind him its skin picks up and reflects tiny points of flickering cangle light seems to ripple as it moves
big black shiny smooth head moves into the taper light
it moves towards her cable like arms held out at its side moving out of sync with its feet ripley tries to move to cry out she cant
she can only move her eyes
she looks over at john sleeping peacefully
he doesnt notice the alien the alien moves closer
she can feel his breath it evaporates the sweat on her forehead a chill runs through her but she still cant move the alien stands alongside her bed
extends a six fingered hand
gently rests it on her stomach
cocks its head like its listening to something
the implication is clear
ripley finds her voice her eyes open wide she sits bolt upright
a hand moves to her forehead
gently pushes her head back to the pillow
youre out of it
out of it
ripley falls back eyes glued to where the alien appeared
john sees her focal point looks back over his shoulder nothing
ripleys eyes roll back into her head
she tries to speak it was there
her hand at her side tightens into a fist johns hand covers hers
eases the fingers open again
she feels the coarse bandages against her palm
he starts to read quietly from saint augustines confessions
she begins to drowse again as his soft voice flows over her like waves lapping against the shore
a howling dust storm has kicked up
the monks wear small round goggles have rags tied over their noses as they work at a huge block and tackle arrangement hundreds of ropes grow taut
they lift ripleys ship swing it over to a large portal ripley lays with eyes closed
muffled voices outside her door how is the woman john
i dont think shes here yet
at the sound of johns voice the slightest smile plays across ripleys sleeping lips
she is close though
as they continue talking ripley wakes
opens her eyes
rolls over onto her side there is a window right next to the bed
ripley lifts herself up on one elbow looks out garden of earthly delights
monks laboring under a beautiful celestial blue sky picking apples fishing on the water on small inland lakes
working with hammer and saw on small wooden cottages
it makes her feel good
she scans the countryside
sheep graze around wooden ladders stretching hundreds of feet up to the ripley does a take with crude brushes at the end of poles paint the sky blue
the abbey the cottages the fields outside her window are all on one level inside the planet
the vaulted ceiling painted to look like the sky with huge glass windows to allow the sunlight in is actually the underside of the planetoids outer shell
ripley looks back at the monks on the ground instead of repairing they are taking the cabins apart stacking the wood onto push carts what the hell
the sulaco escape ship appears in front of her
swings past her window suspended by ropes
then disappears up out of sight
ripley checks her pulse
this must be a dream
a bad one
she rolls back onto the bed
stares up at the ceiling
monks scurry around the ship as it is lowered into place on a flat area of the roof above the libaray
it seats with a deeply resounding thud
hears the sound and then another her door opening
she turns to find the abbot and john standing in the doorway
john waits in the doorway as the abbot crosses to the chair by the bed and sits
who are you
i am the abbot
leader of this colony
how did i get here
your vehicle crash landed
indicates john brother john found you and brought you here
where is here
this is the minorite abbey within the manmade orbiter arceon
can i use a radio to we have no radio here
we are a monastic order that has renounced all modern technology
we live the old way
the pure way
she shakes her head
uh i i still dont feel
whoever took me out of the stasis tube must not have run the full d f program
the abbot looks at her blankly
there was a little girl with me you were alone
she was with me
i put her in her stasis tube we launched when the you were the only living thing found aboard that vessel
the abbot watches ripley as the terrible truth overcomes her slowly oh god
she stops gets that chill up her spine she realizes that she must have brought the alien with her
it came with us
the abbot leans in
what came with you
listen there is a danger here
it came with me
how long have i been here
almost two days calculates loose for two days
this planet could be overrun within the week
ripley grabs the abbot by his cassock look theres a xenomorph sees his confusion an alien creature
and now its here
the abbot looks at her the way you look at that guy on the corner of santa monica and rd whos babbling about judgement day
the guy with his pants down around his kness
she sees this releases her hold on him
calm down ripley
okay i was with a platoon of colonial marines on a mission to planetoid lv
we left earth six months ago maybe a year interrupts wait a moment the abbot becomes aware of johns presence in the doorway
turns over his shoulder at him
john waits there a beat then backs out and closes the door
we launched in the cruiser sulaco from gateway sub orbital space station not possible
what do you mean
when we left earth seventy years ago it was on the brink of a new dark age
technology was on the verge of destroying the planets environment
a computer virus was threatening to wipe away all recorded knowledge
there didnt seem to be any way it could be averted
in the almost forty years since we were towed out here in hypersleep the news that came with occasional supply ships only got worse
finally the ships stopped coming
we had to resign ourselves to the fact that worst had come to pass and the earth no longer existed
now she gives him that look
forget the earth how many people do you have here
lets worry about them
warn them a new look overtakes the abbots face
a look of fear
now shes getting to him or is she
he abruptly stands
your mind is troubled
you need to rest some more
i dont need rest i need to get to your people
youve got to get to them tell them about the alien he heads for the door i have had enough for now
didnt you hear what i said
it could wipe out the entire population of this planet
it may have started already have there been any unusual deaths since i got here
the abbot stops in the door no
and there wont be
the abbot slams the door behind him
john stands nearby as the abbot addresses two burly monks bolt it
the guards move to bolt the door
what is it whats wrong
your patient is in a dangerous mental state
nobody gets in or out until i say so
her meals nobody
father i dont understand the abbot turns and disappears down the hall
john looks from the departing abbot to the two guard monks
john has his head buried in his hands
his back rises and falls with the rhythmic breathing of sleep
mattias curled up on his feet
asleep as well
the library door flies open
john sits bolt upright a hysterical monk bursts in
rushes to johns table
the abbot said youd i need youre the medic what
my sandy shes ill john tries to rub the fitfull sleep out of his eyes
john returns his head to the table
one of your sheep
call a vet
father anselm was the vet
john looks under his arms at mattias the dog just stares at him
youre no help
okay let me get my bag
all creatures great and small
a small structure housing a handful of sheep and a few chickens in wire cages
the wooden walss are full of gaps where boards have been ripped off
the hysterical monk holds a torch to illuminate the scene
one of his sheep is laying on its side
i just gave her dinner and she keeled over
so would i
its freezing in here
been using the wood from the walls for the fire in my cabin
havent we all
john kneels at the ewe
shes breathing heavy
john puts his left hand down on the hay covered floor while he checks the animals neck pulse with his right hand
she gives a weak baa ah
may be pneumonia
pitch some of that hay around her
stop this damn cold breeze
the hysterical monk props the torch up in an empty bucket and retreives a crude iron pitchfork from the wall
starts to pile hay around the fallen animal
first ill he sits up to reach for his back then stops when he sees whats on his left hand wait a minute
the hysterical monk stops on mid pitch
john rubs the material between his fingers
brings it close to his nose
what is it
i dont know
its all over the ground
some sort of the ewe starts to shake quiver john tries to hold it down the hysterical monk at this juncture goes completely apeshit
help m the ewe is shaking so violently that john is thrown back he knocks over the bucket the torch falls into the hay the light is cut off as
the torch almost smothers
then the hay starts to burn weak fire light revealing baaaa aha sclortch h
stomach bursts spraying the two monks with entrails and blood they start screaming
the flickering fire light grows as
bursts out of the jerking and twitching carcass
it shows the characteristics of the animal in which it has gestated
tiny razor sharp teeth and black glass like eyes peer from a enlongated head covered with downy but gore matted wool
a quadroped its shrunked hind legs struggling to free itself from the cooling morass of intestines
john can only scream as the most horrible nightmare he can imagine tries to slough off the animals mortal coil
the hysterical monk fear overcome with anger at the loss of his beloved sandy steps in front of the near catatonic medic and instinctively thrusts his pitchfork into the creature
the sharp prongs pierce its still forming body the creature wails a high pitched shriek half alien half sheep as it is roughly torn from its nesting place the monk lifts it twists at the end of the fork acid blood dripping onto the wood floor each drop bursting into a little pool of fire
the hysterical monk turns to the now raging hay fire the entire corner of the barn is ablaze shoves the abomination in the sheep alien pops and sizzles as tongues
of flame leap up to lap at its struggling body tiny tail whipping about the creature dies its fading screams are soon the only sound heard within the barn
the hysterical monk holds his fork in the flame as he looks back to check on face contorted eyes glued to the burning creature
heaving lungs push air through his diaphram but no sound comes from his open mouth the doctor in training has seen the devil
wooden walls collapse inward as the building becomes a pyre
acrid black smoke curls up to the ceiling and spreads out across the rafters
we pull back from the sight into a window
into ripley watches the burning barn
frustrated she climbs out of the bed on unsteady legs wearing her tank top and shorts
pulls on a coarse wollen cassock ties the rope belt idiots
ill the door bursts open what the
four burly monks rush in and grab her
tear her out of bed ripley is dragged down the darkened hallway
an evil has come to arceon
as he continues we move down a row of stern monk faces ending at the abbots
you heard brother graham tell of the devil inside sheeps wool he motions towards the hysterical monk sitting in the crowd
an evil brought by this woman in her vessel of technology
a large circular room with wooden walls stretching thirty feet high
light creeps in through stained glass windows
hundreds of monks sits in a gallery that looms over the floor of the tribunal
on the floor the abbot and the five eldest monks sit at a long table facing the witness stand
on the stand considers the faces that surround her
this cant be happening
you have no voice in this tribunal
you must listen to me
youre all in terrible danger
it came with me on the ship we know that
at first we believed its arrival was a good omen
but it has only brought pestilence
ripley turns to the abbot
yes the ship brought it
it brought the alien
i told you its here
we know the name of the evil it brought
it brought technology
technology to destroy our planet as surely as it destroyed the earth
i was on the earth less than a year ago
its still there
people cities all still there
a murmur through the crowd
some are listening to her
the abbot looks around
he must be in command
matter of fact all dead
screams its still there
the abbot smiles to himself for making her crack
he stands and begins to pace
you could not have been on the earth a year ago because there is no earth to be on for at least twenty years
i havent been floating in space for twenty years
let me get to my ship and ill prove it
who knows what new evils shell release if allowed back into that infernal machine
dont let her
this woman is a danger
she denies the new dark age
she denies reality
this is reality
there is a xenomorph loose on this planetoid a alien it must have stowed away on my ship must have killed swallows hard newt
killed the girl i brought with me
you cant stop it
it goes inside you like an egg grows mimes explodes out of you keeps growing into some sort of monster
kills you kills all of you
she looks at the medieval people around her
they stare at her in complete confusion
to them she does sound like a madwoman
who are you people
look at you all of you the way youre dressed
this isnt the middle ages
youre in space on a artifical planet
what are you doing out here
there in the upper tier john
they make eye contact
she looks to him pleadingly
isnt there anyone here who will listen
john looks from ripley to the abbot
the abbot stares him down
john turns away
defeated i guess not
i cant believe this
the gavel bangs
the abbot sits in a moment of contemplation
then there is no choice
the four monks grab ripley roughly bind her arms
to ripley the evil is inside you
i cast you down
to be sealed away
and god have mercy on your soul
a medieval elevator shaft
the elevator is a wooden cage lowered on thick rough hewn ropes
ripley bound is led to it
she looks back at the monks who have gathered at the door you wont be able to fight it
you dont know what it is
shes put into the cage
the door is secured
two monks begins to pull the ropes
the cage is lifted out over the abyss a vast cavernesque space
the other monks move closer
crowd around the edge john pushes through them right to the edge watches as the cage is slowly lowered down
ripley looks directly at john youve sentenced yourselves to death
john watches as she disappears down into the darkness
then turns and pushes his way through the crowd down the hall empty now except for the abbot and the tribunal members
they speak in hushed tones
john appears in the doorway but pauses strains to hear what they are saying theyll have started before she gets down to the hermitage level
only finding the wood for the ship
but andersons hut was about that big and hes dead three months now
i had that wood earmaked for the cloister next winter
well we might not get to the winter if we dont take care of this
by winter time we can start taking the penitent cells apart
no one in them
the wood isnt going to last forever
neither are we he becomes aware of johns presence and motions the other tribunal members out of the room
john moves to the abbot
the abbot knows whats coming
i tended her yes and you did a good job
you shouldnt feel responsible
you couldnt have known please sir let me finish
i feel that there may be something to what she says
the abbot moves to his table begins to gather up his gavel notebook
john follows him i dont understand what you are doing
this colony is my responsibility
i am protecting the colony
you never gave her a chance
how can you be so sure youre right
a better question is what makes you think im wrong
you didnt see this thing this demon brother graham and i we both saw it
realizes thats right
you both did
beat and what was it
i i dont know what it was
but i dont think ripley was a party to it
she admits she brought it
but she tried to warn us you know thats how the devil works
but i believe her
i dont know how to describe it a feeling
you havent seen a woman in thirty years
where does this feeling originate john
points to his head here
i believe you
but your feelings are fooling you
its its her conviction
i just think the abbot snaps at him dont think
john takes a step back at the abbots tone
a tone hes never heard before
the abbot runs a hand through his thinning hair
forces a smile
its been a long night
for all of us
you really dont understand what youre dealing with here
thats what she said
the abbot chafes
these are ideas which threaten the very system we live under
the creature is dead and the woman is gone
go anywhere but leave this alone
but i alone
ill get philip to let mattias into the library all right
for your own good just stay out of this
john looks like hes going to protest
i mean it
slowly yes father
john turns and leaves the room
the abbot stares after him
a nail is hammered into a board
the board is old twisted
the grain is pronounced splintered
another board is lifted into place a nail held bam bam bam hammered in tight
drab torn gray clothing
hammer the boards over the opening in the wall
methodically covering up watching them work
a dozen monks frantically hammer planks up around the sulacco escape ship a frame of wood begin to wall it in
the two ancient workers continue their carpentry
the planks cover more of the opening
covers more of ripley
planks are rising around the ship
locking away the good omen turned evil
john and mattias sit before an open book
he doesnt read
he can hear the pounding of the hammers
it seems to reverberate through the planet
through his skull
he closes his eyes in pain
only her face is visible
then just her eyes
just before the last plank is put in place here you go woman
something from your ship
something to keep you company he tosses it into the cell
ripley catches it
watches as the last of the light is covered over
she continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow accustomed to the darkness
the little light creeping between the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see what it is she has caught ripley looks around her cell actually a
narrow space behind other cells one wall curved out like a narrow slice crossways towards the edge of the pie
looks at the dolls head in her hand
she freaks out
you fucking idiots
youre all dead
beats the walls
smashes her head against the wall
her nose starts to bleed
her hand goes to her nose
she squints in the darkenss
sees the blood
tastes the iron taste in her mouth
death is with her again
the widest part of her cell the middle allows her to slide down into a sitting position
i cant get rid of it
looks at the dolls head newt
this isnt what i wanted
she throws the dolls head away it bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position so that it is staring at her
snaps dont stare at me
ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her where it meets the floor in the rotting timbers a hole
in it bright wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut
hes looking back at her
the sulaco escape pod is now a memory as the monks have finished walling it up
now just another part of the abbey
as the monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow pass them down to an open window and into
john is here mattias asleep at his feet
the tables the benches the floor are covered with hundreds of books hes pulled off the shelves their chains all tangled
all open to different representations of evil through the ages lucifer shaitan ahriman asmodeus satan
the temptation of christ from the master of schloss lichtenstein
satan roasting on an enormous grill from tres riches heures du duc de berry
the devil as a serpent
as a semi humanoid
gruenwalds temptation of st
pachers saint wolfgang and the devil
a miasma of medieval monsters
picks his way through the mess
like a man possessed he fumbles through book after book
the first golden rays of daylight filter through the huge stained glass windows
john rapidly flips through the medieval tome in front of him past an illustration of satan depicted as having a face on his ass further still then stops
this is it
we cant see what the illustration is but we see his reaction his eyes open wide as saucers
slams the book closed as if the image would strike blind
he turns to mattias as if to say something decides not to wake the sleeping dog
john wraps the books chain around his hand and puts one foot up against the shelf
the old chain gives way
face set he loops the shoulder strap of his burlap medical bag over his shoulder
clutches the book to his chest gently pets his sleeping dog and goes
john strides down the corridor purposefully but stops and flattens himself against the wall when the door to the abbots office opens suddenly brother graham the hysterical monk is forcibly
led from the room by two burly monks taken down the corridor in the other direction
he is gagged
a third burly monk moves out of the doorway with the abbot
now find john and have him brought to me immediately
start in the library
and keep it quiet
the third burly monk nods and moves off
the abbot watches him leave then goes back into the room and closes the door
john stares at the closed door a beat and then makes up his mind
he turns and runs back down the hallway
the first monks straggle in for the morning shift
kyle is among them
he lifts his blowing iron from a wall mounted rack and moves towards the glass furnace as two other monks begin to stoke the fire
looks around the room and for a frantic moment cannot find at the glass furnace
about to dip his blowing iron into the molten glass
john runs over to him
almost knocks him over hey
he sees that john is agitated what
what is it
the other monks begin to notice the commotion start moving in for a look
must john tries to catch his breath
he gestulates wildly
kyle puts down his blowing iron
take a deep breath christ now i sound like you he sees the book clutched in johns white knuckled hands
is that it john
is it the book
kyle moves closer to him
john sees the other monks gathering around closing in on him whispering hes got it
like the comet woman
he found her
john sees one of the monks run out undoubtedly going to tell the abbot
john looks into his friend kyles face fear
everythings gonna be fine
now lets see the dont humor me im sure
everythings gonna be fine
if only he could explain he cant
john yanks the book away spins bursts through the crowd
the cage is still down the ropes stretching into the abyss
john runs in
moves to the ropes
places the book on the floor
tightens his scarred hands on the rope mind racing the woman will know
know what it is
how to combat it
he pulls theres no tension against the ropes
john falls back on his ass
the ropes whiz through the rusty pulley overhead
pile on the floor in front of john
he lifts the end of the rope
stares john runs through the building
through the upper half of the planet
down through the many levels past dozens of monks oblivious to the previous nights events and the danger they face monks working at looms
monks in the tanning room
monks in morning prayer
past them all to mops and brooms
his hair is wild breathing heavy
he shoves the book into his medical bag
pushes aside a box of kindling wood to reveal a wooden door set into the timbers of the floor
he opens the door extending down through huge open areas beneath the upper level
past vast underground viaducts that held up by wooden rafters
beyond that a great underground sea that marks the center of the planet below that the cells
can smell the dank air from the lower tunnels
he must go down the hard way
he climbs into the darkness
an enormous room over a football field in length consisting of at least a hundred open toilet stalls facing a hundred wall mounted sinks
their condition though bespeaks the awful truth the stalls furthest away from us are cobwebbed
some have had the side walls stripped for fire wood
of the original hundred sinks maybe twenty are still functional a facility created for a much larger number of colonists than are left
a skinny monk washes his hands
moving down the row of stalls chest high thank you past a few empty stalls and several grimacing faces the second to last being the abbot cold tonight continuing to
the last bald tribunal member
gets colder every night
and every day
never this bad
taken so much wood out of the structure the surface wind blows right through the colony
right under the floor the bald tribunal member shivers as a cold breeze runs along the waste trough under the floor and chills the air in his bowl
right up your bloody backside
nights like this make me miss plumbing ack
he feels a tugging at his bowels its not piles
i dont aah the bald tribunal monk screams as something grabs him from below note the left half of the following pages is cut off
i have completed the text to the best of my ability
something snakes up his rectum and hooks into his lower intestine
he convulses in spasms of agony
there is a terrible ripping sound as the bald tribunal monk is pulled violently down out of frame we pan back down the row of stalls tight on each sitting
monk and see their horrified reaction as they feel the alien drag the bald tribunal monks body away under them
the abbot in his stall he pounds on the wall matthew
jesus whats wrong
skinny monk washing his hands sees all this
looses control of his bodily functions as blood sprays from the faucet in their stalls as the toilets reject a torrent of gore
blood and viscera spraying the walls converting the abbey into an abattoir
angle on the orbitor arceon an orb of wood hands peacefully against a tapestry of celestial seas
somewhere water drips into a puddle
ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting near the hole in the floor
her eyes are closed
wherever i go
a hand pushes a crust of bread through the hole
she opens her eyes to look at the food
the white haired mans head appears take it
thanks but no thanks anthony
she knows his name
you waiting for meat
they dont bring me meat because they know im an android
really dont need it
breads better for you anyway
harder to digest so it makes you feel fuller than you are
anthony takes a bite
just a little crunchy
ripley twists onto her back until shes staring up at the ceiling
waste of time
you dont eat youll starve to death girl
that was the plan when they put me down here
and why should you care
because im a synthetic person you dont think i can care
believe me thats a discussion you dont want to have with me
you told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids thats one of each
that means you could go either way
im tired of talking about this
he pushes the bread towards her again
youve still gotta eat
you gotta fight the bastards im tired of fighting
maybe ill be dead before he finds me
maybe he wont get the satisfaction
you make it sound like this alien has a personal score to settle with you
the biology you describe queen laying eggs larvae drone thats very insectoid
insects usually dont bear grudges
and androids usually arent the prisoners of lunatics that believe theyre ancient greeks
and theyve only chose to live the life style they dont believe theyre hears something whats that
ripley strains to listen
in the distance knocking
someone is knocking on the walls
a voice calls out hoarse ripley
he moves down the hallway
bangs his fist against the walls every few feet waits a moment for a reply then moves on
anthony gets off the floor moves so she can see into his cell the walls of anthonys cell are covered with charcoal sketches different versions of demons and the devil
she rolls her eyes this guy is an android
anthony crosses to his cell door peers through eye level
john coming towards him knocking on the doors of boarded up cells
hey you knocking cut it out youre going to wake everybody up
john moves to anthonys door
looks at him through the slot
anthony recognizes him
john unbolts anthonys door
picks him up by his cassock anthony
thought you dead fifteen years
made too good for that
whatre you doing
i im looking the abbot what
you look like youve seen the devil
anthony turns to look back at ripley moves aside so john can see her face at the hole you mean he anthony turns back john is gone
as john begins to pull the outermosk planks off
i was right wasnt i
youve seen it youve seen the alien
john pauses at that
his eyes tighten at the memory
i can tell you have
i was right
it came with me
to the wall sharp go away
looks at the wall
ripleys voice comes clearly through the wood
listen priest or whatever you are i know what you want
i cant help you
i couldnt help any of the others
just stop what youre doing
do you understand
john has opened a crack that exposes ripleys eyes
he stares at her a beat tries to think of what to reply he goes back to work as she continues her confession
you going to stay father
but youre not going to talk
then you can listen
you should listen
your abbot was right
i am guilty
but not of heresy
john stops again
just stares at her eyes
the murder of the crew of the nostromo
that was when i first met the alien
that reminds him of why hes here
he doubles his efforts at the boards
no not the same one thats here now
or maybe it is
maybe theyre all the same one
i couldnt save my crew then
i should have been able to
but i couldnt
when i went the second time her eyes soften
then i met newt
i fought stayed alive to keep newt alive
hoped maybe that would make up for
she trails off
slides down the wall
now he got her too
whats the point
hard again just go away
leave me in here
if you let me out youll want me to help you and it will start all over again
let it end
john breaks through flickering torch light streams in the mote filled air around him
ripley looks up at him
i cant help you
john heaving and panting from the excertion
it never ends
a long twisted plank floored corridor with a torch every twenty feet
there is movement at the far end
something is coming towards us flickering in and out of the light and shadow sheep
anthony carries a long wooden staff like a spear
john has his bag
ripley a torch
we move with them
it must be able to take on some of the characteristics of the animal it grows in
maybe they are from some sort of aggressive soldier race warring parties drop the eggs on opposing planets and the alien takes on the form of the creature that finds
it assuming that animal is the dominant life form on the planet
so when it gestates in a man ripley shudders at the memory
its a biped
in a sheep or cow a quadroped
i just didnt think it could do that to animals
wait a minute i thought you were the expert on this monster
is that the only reason you came to get me out
because i knew about this thing
i mean no
i mean that was part of it
i never thought you were wrong
i was wrong not to say anything
i was afraid to speak up
its hard to be a monk you know
looks at him
a long beat
if anything youre honest
we all are
i dont know about the abbot
im sure he thinks what he did was right
is that speaking up for someone
they turn a corner
this hallway slopes downwards a few degrees
the three find themselves trotting leaning backward to keep their balance
all right lets forget about the past and get on to our survival
no more prisoners behind us
not for years
okay if the aliens had a few days to lay his eggs our only hope is to get off this what is this
get to my ship and get off this satellite
we cant what
cant leave the library a tape library
the reason we are out here
like the monks who guarded monastery libraries on remote islands off england during the first plague there must be books on other colonies some of these books survived the burning
of the libraries of alexandria
they contain knowledge that exists in no other record
their value is unestimable
he runs his hand along the spine of the book in his bag
were supposed to protect them
to anthony and what does an android have to do with all this
hes a spy
the company planted me here
what does the company have to do with this
they built this prison
they are all political heretics
ripley looks at john
you left that part out
the order was more of a counter culture a reaction to the technology that was beginning to take over everyones lives
it was a simple enough idea read dont watch disk
walk dont pump more carbons into the air
the earliest members renounced technology
started to collect the remaining books
nobody would have noticed if it hadnt been for the virus
your abbot talked about that
the new plague
a computer virus
a bad program
by this time the corporate structure was transglobal all the worlds data storage systems were linked
it spread through two countries before it was stopped
after a scare like that thousands flocked to our retreat
people started clamoring for written information
for our books
they abandoned the modern ways i think i can see how this comes out
they gave up their possessions
this was a threat to the company
they sold the technology
a movement to live simply was quickly twisted by federal agents into a political movement against the company controlled world government
too much was at stake
too much profit
we were sentenced as political dissidents
this orbiter is our gulag
all the men were packed up with all our books and towed into space
ten thousand men
the eldest died very quickly
the company had such a sense of irony
sending you out on this wooden tub
i was placed among them as a sensor
keeps tabs on the movement
so howd they find out about you
i told them
after the supply ships stopped coming i saw no point in keeping up the charade
since i was a sort of walking reminder of technology they cast me down
join the club
to john i figured this wasnt planned
you dont have to be a genius to see it wouldnt be prudent to try to preserve mans written works for generations without women
john looks embarrassed
and i dont know about your new plague but i was just on earth and everythings fine
john has a doubtful look
i was right about the alien wasnt i
means i must be right about the earth
the logic behind her argument is uncomfortable
thats better than nothing
they reach the end of the corridor
it opens into an enormous open space between cell blocks
the wall behind them is honey combed with corridor openings going up four stories connected by aged warped wooden ladders reminiscent of indian cave dwellings
the room stretches several football field lengths ahead of them falling off into gloom
they stand silent for a moment dwarfed by the size of the room and the task ahead of them
finally at any rate lets forget about the earth completely whether youre right or im right whats important is getting the hell out of here
from here my ship is
john points up at the ceiling
and this is
anthony and john nod
this orbiter was patterned after a medieval concept of the universe makes a circle in the air they call the top half heaven the abbey the fields the bottom half
where we are
whats in the middle
work with me here
how far is it back to the surface of the planet
as a stone falls five miles through the center
and the elevator the thing they lowered me down in
first he cuts their escape off then works his way down through the monastery level by level until there isnt a thing left alive
well you start appreciating him more than me and ill find a way to shut you down capisce andy
how do we get up
there are ladders
john and anthony continue on a few steps and then stop and walk back to her
five miles with the alien between us and there
good luck boys
she turns and heads back towards her cell john catches her shoulder you cant cant what
not help you go to your deaths
ive had my fill of that
i need you
i cant do it alone
ive fought these creatures twice before
it take a lot to kill these things
we dont have weapons here
how about something we can make weapons from
do you have anything like that any modern things here
john shakes his head vehemently we renounced technology
it was those things that caused the plague
this is a man made planet
something has to be recirculating your air your water
i dont know
i just took it for granted
most people do
without some sort of technology we havent got a chance
from behind them there is technology
john and ripley turn to look at him
a technology room
fresh air and water come out
an atmosphere processing plant the heart and lungs of arceon
where is it
one level beneath the underground sea
thats five levels up points into the gloom on the other side of the orbiter
john looks at ripley a chance
ripley looks from johns earnest face to the darkness and back
youve got me so far
but heres the deal i dont know how many of your brethren are going to be alive when we get up there but if we make it to my ship
youre all coming with me
well take as many of your precious books as we can carry but were going
im not going to fight this thing again to end up alone again
john nods his head
were all dead anyway
we might as well go fi she feels a twinge in her midsection doubles over
anthony and john each take an arm ugh im all right
she takes a deep breath
still thawing out
i hate hyper sleep
the formerly idyllic landscape has been reduced to a scorched battlefield
wooden huts leveled
small fires dot the land
the air thick with ash and greasy smoke
dozens of monks swarm across the countryside like ants on a mound of spilt sugar
in one hand a taper or torch held high in the other hand their weapon scythe pitchfork hoe whatever they could get ahold of seem pitifully out of place
some pound sharpened stakes into the ground others push carts into rough barricades
a platoon of monks huddle around trap doors open on the wooden ground
they climb down to just beneath the monastery level of the satellite an underground wheatfield
tall golden grass stretches out for miles swaying gently around huge wooden columns that support the abbey fifty feet above a lattice work of suspended troughs and wooden pipes the
plumbing the understructure of the monastery
descend the ladders single file
fear is in all of their faces though most have only heard the stories
they move cautiously into the wheat
spread out through the field in the jaggedly drawn skirmish line
the bald tribunal monks dried blood splattered on his cassock stands atop an empty wooden wagon
from this vantage point he watches thrash and poke their way forward leaving trails through the high grass
their attempt at an orderly progression quickly falls apart as they get strung out all over the field
sotto stay together
then another movement catches the abbots eye ahead of the monks the wheat waves against the wind
begins to ripple the wheat flattens
a trail forms
something is moving in the long grass
moving towards the lead monk fast
the abbot opens his mouth as if to shout a warning even though the monk closest to the moving trail is too far away to hear him before he can
make a sound the alien closes the gap feeling horribly helpless he can only watch as aargh aa
the lead monk gives one strangled cry before he disappears beneath the surface of the long grass
his taper falls among the long dry stalks begins to smoke
the abbot can see the trail moving towards his men before they can
he finds his voice run
the monks in the field turn from the spot where the monk screamed towards the abbot turn their backs to the now moving again trail no no
the the alien hits the skirmish line at a flanking angle raking through five monks like a scythe through wheat
his tail arms whip out snap their spines like kindling
lost torches ignite the wheat
the field bursts into flame
smoke fills the air
in the smoky commotion the monks break rank and start running
weapons in front of them swinging wildly screaming
one frightened monk runs through another with his pitchfork
another hears something crashing through the grass towards him and buries his scythe in his best friends chest
and through it all the alien seems to be everywhere
using the chalky smoke for cover as it slashes and tears its way across the field frozen in terror to the spot
squints through the smoke to see what has happened to his flock
hears the wails of defeat rising up from the wounded
the waving grass is flattened as the alien moves towards him he can finally pry himself from his perch on the wagon
he climbs down
as his feet hit the wooden floor he feels a shadow fall over him
the little hairs on the back of his neck stand up
he slowly turns
rises out of the grass in front of the holy man
slowly rises up to its height of almost three meters
its long smooth head is no longer black and slimy
it is golden
its cable like arms are sheathed in a straw like covering
it has adapted to the environment of the wheat field
its now grass like lips draw back into a ghastly parody of a smile
the abbot screams and runs
it isnt your fault you know
they move across the huge room
anthony a few paces ahead
their candles throwing only enough light to see several yards
wind whistles through the huge room timbers creaking like some gigantic old house settling
those things you said before ripley remembers her confession
i read about it in psychology books
sometimes when people outlive someone they cared for they transfer some of the guilt for that persons death to themselves
i got a belly full of that from the psychtechs when i was on earth
survivor guilt syndrome or something like that
but thats not what i was thinking about
i was thinking about my friend up there
she looks up
he was on the pod
he killed newt but not me
why not me
its almost like hes playing with me
maybe they have some sort of race memory
maybe he knows what i did to his mother
thats why he didnt just kill me
that would be too easy
he has to torment me
you make it sound human
hell i dont know what it is
john unconsiously fingers his book
i think i do
at the end of the space a rough hewn wooden ladder leads to another block of cell corridors four stories up
years of damp air have warped the ladder
ripley leads the way torch in her left hand
ripley is the first one up
she raises her torch and heads down the new corridor alone
the cells here have no doors
she holds her torch in one an old skeleton sits in quiet contemplation
john is just climbing off anthony right behind him
anthony is winded
he reaches up for a helping hand
john looks back and sees that ripley has moved ahead without them then reaches down to help anthony
their hands clasp he is seemingly standing in an open field sheep grazing peacefully at his side
suddenly he is attacked by a horde of medieval demons
fish faced demons
man headed bird demons
they fly about him grab hold of his limbs
the sheep nearest him opens its mouth to reveal a horde of razor sharp fangs sinks them into his ankle anthony screams
down the corridor hears the scream turns back sees anthony fighting with himself struggling against johns grasp balanced precariously on the top of the ladder in the real world as
he fights against the demons in his android mind he jerks pulls his left ankle out of the grasp of the demon sheep off the ladder forty foot drop waiting below him
struggles to keep his death grip on anthonys hand
its all that keeps anthony from falling back down the shaft jesus christ
he pulls with all his might
sees a horrible bird demon grasping his hand in its beak biting through his wrist
he waves his staff in the air he aims for its head whacks johns hand with his staff john howls in pain lets go anthony teeters back on one foot
arms waving in the air ripleys hands shoot out grab anthonys cassock stop his fall
anthonys eyes open wide at the sight of this new horror a terrible wet black cable armed creature thats latched itself onto his cassock long shiny head
ripley has become the alien
anthony hits the creature with his staff hits ripley on the head
in the face
john tries to take hold of anthonys staff arm the cane whips against the side of his head knocking him back
ripley sets her feet and pulls on anthonys cassock opens her mouth grunts anthony sees the terrible alien open its maw to devour him
his staff connects with the bridge of ripleys nose
she sees flashes of light loses her balance pitches forward starts to go over with anthony wraps his arms around the struggling pair and like a sumo wrestler lifts and
falls backwards carrying the three of them into the corridor whumph
they land on the floor in a heap
anthony continues to flail about ripley and john pin him to the floor between them
finally the vision leaves him
he loses consciousness
breathing heavy opens his eyes hes staring right into ripleys face
less than an inch away
hes laying on top of her
shes breathing heavy too
a long uncomfortable moment
they roll off each other
her hand goes up to her nose
im all right
john reaches into his bag withdraws a small cotton bag
hold this against your nose
itll stop the flow
she looks over at him questioningly
im a doctor
she holds the small bag against her nose
the bleeding stops
they move over to anthony try to help him to his feet
he shakes them off
just let me sit
he rubs his temples
white milk like sweat runs down his cheek
what was that
the reason im down here
john points to his own eyes
androids cant dream
thats probably what they thought when they built me
but my brain is cyber organic patterned after the human brain it functions the same way a human brain does
it accumulates random images and sensations during waking hours but unlike the human brain that sloughs them off during sleep androids dont sleep
maybe theyve fixed this on later models but i dont
do you know what happens to the human brain when it is deprived of sleep
it starts to run off the dreams while youre awake as hallucinations
same thing with me
for twenty years i absorbed data on this planetoid
a little after we lost contact with earth the visions started
they thought i was insane
i had to explain that it was because i was an android
they liked that even less
what did you see
what i always see
images of monsters
they stand for an evil yet to come
just images ive absorbed from those old books and have no way to get rid of
i saw the inside of your cell
shrugs my head is full of them
i try to get them out any way i can
his eyelids droop
you need sleep
i know that
ill settle for rest
he closes his eyes
ripley recovers the torch
stay with him
ripley tried to stand john takes her arm pulls her down
we all need rest
ripley considers him
she smiles and sits
besides you see what happens when you get ahead of us
we should stay together
hes still above us anyway
what do you mean
ive faced this evil twice before i guess ive gotten sensitive to it beat youre really a doctor
john pats his canvas bag
see my bag
whats that book
just a book
i dont buy just a book from a guy who says we cant leave the planet without the library
a medical book i might need
you dont have any food in there do you
only if you can eat bandages
ripley rubs her midsection
in a few hours thats going to sound good
going in and out of suspended animation christ i probably havent eaten in a year
without opening eyes you shouldve eaten the bread
ripley lets her head loll back against the wall
closes her eyes
her brow knits
john sees this
you all right
you werent hurt when i landed on you
bruised a rib
he reaches over and puts his hands beneath her cassock
feels her midsection
his hands are warm
are you sure youre a doctor
he withdraws his hands
my father passed on when we first came here
the abbeys physician father anselm took me in
he really raised me pause taught me what he could before he passed away
he was schooled on earth
well im just hungry
you havent eaten since i took you out of your tube
you did that
she reaches out and takes hold of his hands
turns them over
you burned yourself on the escape pod
her hands on his makes him feel
thank you i guess
they look into each others eyes you shouldve eaten the bread
ripley embarrassed releases his hands
looks at anthony
hes trying to stand
theres beasties afoot
they start into
ceiling so low their torches must be held out in front of them
ripley makes an effort not to move faster than the two monks
a great long ladder hanging in the middle of nowhere
seems at least a mile long
the group climbs
liquid drips through the ceiling planks over head
falls into red puddles on the slanted floor
john kneels dips his fingertips blood
sniffs mixed with sea water
were getting close to the center of the arc near the sea
john hears somthing
raises his hand stop the group stops
flatten themselves against the wall
john takes anthonys staff
moves forward with it held out in front of him
whirls around a blind corner shoves something against the wall thump
it struggles ripley and anthony run up raise their tapers revealing the abbot
cassock torn dirty
hair eyes wild
anthonys staff across his throat
john pulls back
father sarcastic what are you doing down here father
you look like youve seen something that doesnt exist
the abbot runs his fingers through his hair
smoothes it down
i was their spiritual leader
i was not prepared to lead them in battle
not against that thing
no one could be
i thought you said the evil was inside me that sealing me up was the answer to all your problems
the destruction you brought to us
i only tried to warn you
what are you doing with this woman
we are going to the technology room
trying to find some way to fight you dont join the devil to fight the devil
shes helping us look who defends the deceiver the one who isnt even human
john cant you see what is happening
on ancient earth during the black death many believed that god had abandoned them so they appealed to the devil
flocked to him hoping to save their bodies losing their souls in the bargain
father were all on the run from the same monster so lets not resort to the fire and brimstone routine
ive been enlightened about your movement
pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a planet of heretics
the time for pretense is past
i was trying to keep you quiet
i do what i have to do to keep the brotherhood together
we all gave up believing in earth a long time ago
how do you think they would feel if told their exiled was in vain
that the holocaust they were trying to avoid never occured
those men up there have grown to live with it
and with you as their leader
the abbot smiles
ripley is sharp
you threatened the status quo
so you protector of knowledge and truth lied to them
only about you
the rest i still believe
if earth still orbits its sun there is no way it could have survived being reduced to barbarism
youre as bad as the company
ripley thats why you ran
after all your talk death stared you in the face and you were afraid
not afraid of death
the now four refugees work their way into the final corridor
turns at sharp angles
the floor is uneven wood aged and twisted
warped by years of water dripping from above
the group strings out as it moves into the darkness candles held high
bringing up the rear puts his walking stick down everybody stops at the sound
what was that
anthony pulls his stick from the grasp of a man trap
they lower their candles
look to interspersed throughout the timbers spring jawed steel toothed bear traps
and all around them
in case anyone tried to get in and tamper with the technology
the four of them are standing in the middle of a mine field of man traps
what do we do
we cant just stand here and wait
floors too unstable to try to walk around them
john pulls a loose board from the corridor wall
turns and kneels at the trap in front of him
pokes the end of the board into the jaws
the others jump at the sound john what are you doing
john pulls the stick out of the rusted jaws
moves to the next trap snap
hes thinking like a leader
everyone grab wood
spring the traps
clear a path
proud of him good work father john
ripley pulls a plank from the wall next to her
exposes a bit of the surface underneath its metal
she touches the cool familiar material
now she knows this is not a dream
she turns and springs the trap in front of her slowly make their way down the corridor one hand holding a candle high the other poking a piece of wood
into the trap in front of them
walking carefully around the yet unfired traps
a huge wooden door with no knob or handle
looks like it could almost be part of the wall
john and ripley are the first to it
they put down their planks and begin to feel around the edges of the door for some purchase
the abbot joins them
anthony lags behind
he senses a presence in the hallway
hears a sound behind him
we see a glimpse of something he turns towards the sound empty hallway
starts forward again with his ear cocked to the rear
ripley john and the abbot knock on the door walls
ripley leans her head against the wall in frustration and exhaustion
to get this far and be locked out
she feels sick to her stomach
how long since she had food
she looks over at john
he is staring at her
he turns red at being caught
i just are you allright
without sleep food i just feel my age
smiles figuring hyperspace time im almost a hundred
she wipes her brow and goes back to knocking
the wall beneath his fist sounds hollow
fingernails find the edge of the plank and pull the plank slides aside on tiny rusty pneumatic pistons
a primitive keyboard
circa late twentieth century
i think this is it
ripley and the abbot move over to see
yeah a hundred years ago
to ripley go ahead
go ahead and what
open the door woman
ill get to it but listen to me you may dress like youre living in the middle ages but you cant treat me like your chambermaid or whatever monks had
hears the sound again
turns back quickly the wooden wall moves steps forward adapted itself to look like wood
its body changes transmutes cable like sinew snaking over grained limbs to approximate the more traditional bio mechnoid alien appearance
the weary android sees the alien as a conglommoration of his many medieval images of demons
he hears the aliens hollow raspy breath
it glides towards him
anthony steps back directly into a trap as his mind goes the steel jaws spring shut on his left ankle
milky blood fluid starts to flow
he finds himself in the same predicament as his vision ankle pinned the aliens appendages circling him he screams
ripley is trying to work
she punches numbers into the keyboard
she is too exhausted to see straight
they hear the scream john runs back traps snapping around him ripley turns towards the sound the abbot pushes her back to the keyboard ripley knits her brows
forces herself to focus
her fingers punch the keys
steps towards anthony snap snap snap ap
traps snap closed on its tail its legs his cassock is snagged in a trap
he tears right out of it anthony is in the clutches of the alien
he whacks at the beast with his staff but his blows fall like drops of rain on an elephant
the alien lifts him up to face him
anthony screams as his left leg is stretched agsinst the tension of the traps chain blood pouring as white ribbons from his almost severed ankle
anthony drops his staff and grabs each of the aliens arms with his own android arms
his extra human strength keeps them from squeezing him any tighter but he cannot avert his gaze from the smooth eyeless face
the alien considers him
its thin almost translucent lips pull back to reveal rows of splinter like teeth
the jaws spread making room for the distended tongue the alien hisses puts out anthonys eyes with a thin stream of acidic saliva artificial skin bubbles and blisters picks up
begins to flail away at the demon
ripley is getting no response from the keyboard
ripley slides the keyboard out of the wall compartment
the wires are so old theyve broken
she bites the ends off the wires spits out the insulation
twists the bare wire ends together
sweat runs into her eyes
whacks the alien with anthonys staff again
the creature will not let anthony go
the android writhes in its grasp his face now a blistered pulpy mass eyes gone
finishes hot wiring
the keyboard hums to life
her fingers fly across the keys tail wraps around johns waist pulls him towards it lifts him turns him upside down lips pull back johns hands grope at the floor
sharp metal teeth spread lights code accepted ripleys head whips towards the corridor his hand closes around the end of one of the traps he brings it up it slams closed on the aliens extended tongue
the beast bellows
whips its head from side to side cant shake off the trap acid blood sprays out
lands as pools of fire on the wooden floor
opens with a strained blast of dust see whorcssh
the abbot leaps inside its open
pries anthonys ankle out of his trap
scoops up his staff drags the moaning android back up the corridor stands in open technology room doorway close it close it its coming we wait
john and anthony appear out of the shadows run hobble towards the door acid blood dissolves the traps steel jaws
pulls itself free
head whips towards the escaping monks if it had eyes they would narrow to slits in anger runs up the hall follows john and anthony into the technology room
on the other side of the doorway another keyboard
she punches keys hurry yards away limping
acceptance tone bings
the door starts to slide down the alien is feet away the door seats itself closed with a solid thud
ripley panting rests eyes closed against the rough wooden door
she turns to the room for the first time and finds real man of lamancha wood and cloth windmills
two story high arms slowly rotating
moving enormous volumes of air through the wind tunnel like room
as far as the eye can see
but no electronics
this is the technology room
ripley collapses to the floor and loses consciousness
yellow warning lights pulse
those goddamned strobes are flickering on and off
steam blasts out overhead pipes
the blue spark pilot light muzzles of a flame thrower shyly pokes out from behind a console
its owner cautiously follows
shes breathing heavy
shes wearing a sweat soaked tank top
her eyes flit from side to side
she pokes the weapon out ahead of her and moves into the pod
she silently crosses the distance to newts sleep tube newt sleeps peacefully
ripley allows herself one maternal smile then remembers
her grip tightens in the flame thrower in her hands
she flips a switch to hi heat
moves around the sleep tubes
a noise to her left
she whirls pulls the trigger on the flame thrower click
she tries again a half hearted burp but no flame
she begins to panic senses the aliens presence
looks left right up no alien
looks down the aliens tail is coming up between her legs
she turns right into its grasp
the useless flamethrower skitters across the floor
she pummels the beast with balled up fists
i beat you
i beat you mother fucker
the alien spins her pushes her over across the sleep tube like its taking her from behind
ripley looks down into the sleep tube newt is gone
her dolls head lays in a pool of blood
the alien wraps his arms around ripley
thin lips pull back for a kiss
ripley opens her eyes
shes still in the room with the windmills
somehow this place seems less real than her dream
she looks around john is sitting next to her writing on a piece of parchment
he smiles a relieved smile
i thought wed lost you
what are you writing
last will and testament
beat just kidding
she looks to her left anthony is lying on his back cotton bandage wrapped around his eyes
his ankle is a swollen mess
wires are hanging out
shakes his head hell be fine
no i wont
hes a terrible liar
i guess my visions were prescience after all
how will i ever resolve that with my artifical con science
a creaking floorboard to ripleys right draws her attention to the abbot
do you see what youve delivered us into
lead me not into temptation to kick your ahh ripley tries to stand her head spins
the entire room throbs with the rhythm of the wind
where is the big boy
the abbot points to the door
on the other side of that door
waiting for us to starve to death
ripley moves to the door and feels its cold surface
its playing with us
it could get in here any time it wants
why should he enter
he knows that one of the people in this room is in league with him
were all in the same coracle so to speak
maybe more than one of us
lets talk about the facts mr
she looks at the windmills
this is your technology
even this is forbidden to us
well then the facts are that were screwed
she moves into the room
walks around one of the windmills
an eco system
nothing to recycle your atmosphere except the green plants
winds generated down here looks at the floor windmills use the natural surface winds to turn wheels underground create tides on the seas to recirculate your water
more than that
there are pumps beneath the floor i can feel their vibration
probably pumping this air through charcoal filters
it gets colder all the time here right
john looks at her questioningly
your wood burning fires throw soot into the atmosphere building the cloud layer cutting off the suns rays cooling the planet forcing you to burn more wood
the greenhouse effect
its how the earth almost destroyed itself in the late th century
dont you see
this is a planet set to self destruct
not in ten minutes or two hours but soon
your atmosphere here is finite
if the plants die the fires will eat up all the oxygen this planetoid will be dead everyone will die
the abbot has the look of a man who has been beaten in the last few meters of a marathon
i was just hoping i would be dead long before it came to this
were supposed to die here
thats the point
wait a minute you were exiled
the punishment for our crime was death
anthony sits up
this planet is the supreme triumph of planned obsolesence
a certain amount of primitive materials with an atmosphere processing system as fragile as a real environment but not replenishable
the abbot has a faraway look in his eyes
poetic justice for the anti technologists
the companys best work
you know i used to be a corporate executive
middle range v
then my wife got hit by a speed craft
i chucked it all and joined the order
be a monk see the world
being here being chairman of the board
no now i understand why i landed here
to join you happy lunatics in your deaths
ripley moves away
john starts after her
ripley wait the abbot stands blocks his way
where can she go
beat trapped inside her own prison
a prison in her mind
inside her mind
sparklets of light dance with the june bugs in the recesses of ourmindstheyare coming to danceintheshadowof
john and ripley turn to look at the abbot
he begins to speak faster
vibrates is more accurate a trickle of blood runs from his left ear
ridingthewildwindsofchangenoescapeno escapeforthewickedevilevilthynameis woman
heiscoming foryouuuuuuuuu the abbots head explodes
like a ripe melon dropped ten stories onto pavement
blood bone hair and brain matter spray john
is all that sits atop the blood spurting neck of the abbot
it keeps its hold on the abbots spinal cord the abbots body continues to stagger around arms jerking mechanically as lack of fresh nerve impulses from the brain works its
way through the system
the infant alien headed corpse stumbles towards her she plucks anthonys staff from the floor and swings like a child hitting a baseball from a tee blasts the chest head
burster across the room it hits the floor scrambling
scuttles down into where the windmills meet the floor
it came out of his fucking head
i didnt have to see that to know what that means
he sent him to us
that bastard outside
i cant get away from him
hes fucking with my mind
hes my punishment
before you said it came out of the torso not the head i dont feel like a discussion of alien biology
john comes up next to her
ripley dont she pushes him away and sinks to the floor
i should just wait for the air to run out
i believe i know that we can win there is an answer in our books
your books are gone brother
your world is gone
once that thing starts to lay its eggs all your brothers if they arent already are dead
if thats true then all of us the books are consigned to ashes
he clasps his hands and bows his head
the abbots blood drips off his hands
into a little puddle at ripleys feet
she stares at the blood
feels the pain again
runs her hand across her chest
there are several inconsistancies between this and the other aliens you described
give it up
i think this is important
this may help us fight it
the creature that i fought in the hall when i first saw it it had camoflaged itself to look like wood
ripley looks up
when i saw it in my room it looked the way it did before black mechanical unless that was a dream
i dont think it was
i think that this creature if it is the efficient predator that you say it is has the ability to adapt to its environment
then the reason theyve always looked the same to me is that i only ever saw them in the same environment
or this may be an as yet unseen stage of development you saw a queen this could be like a king ant more highly advanced than the drone bred for
how does this explain the thing that came out of the ewes chest
the abbots head
maybe it can deposit different types of eggs
the chest burster is probably dormant until the host eats the first one i ever saw came out of kane after he started to eat and in one horrible moment
she realizes she hasnt eaten
the pain in her chest
anthony looks towards her does he realize as well
no were not beat yet father brother ripley gets up
if hes taunting me then maybe we can use that
we can beat this bastard
we can get to my ship
we can live
john stands by a ladder that runs up to a trap door in the ceiling
holds a torch
ripley is on the ground with anthony his injured leg splayed out in front of him
skin is palid
dont have second thoughts
blind and crippled i would only slow you down
give him time to figure out what youre doing
just leave me my staff
she shakes his hand
he pulls her closer
anthonys empty eye sockets seem to see as he looks at ripley
ripley i know
ripley crosses to john
poised at the bottom of the ladder they look up at the trap door on the ceiling
he could be waiting on the other side of that door
we might not get ten feet before he kills the three of us
he shakes his head
we had better go then
she smiles back
they move up the ladder
it leads up a damp short shaft walls green with algae to the ladder shaft opens onto a barnacled pier
ripley and john climb out onto the wooden structure
before them an underground sea stretches the width of the entire planet over five miles across
the floor of the lowest level of the top half of the orbiter makes a ceiling that looms a hundred feet overhead
the water sparkles with a golden glow
must be day on the surface of the planet
where is the light coming from
reflect the outside light down great shafts through lenses
thats what they make in the glass factory
look she turns lit from within by daylight beaming down from above pours into the sea a short distance from them
opens to the surface
water flows in and out
i dont know how
theres one at either end
i came down on the other side
what do we do
john points to three small leather and wood coracles bobbing at the end of their ropes
anthony has dragged himself to a sitting position against the bottom of one of the windmills
he winces as he prods his tender ankle with the end of his staff
the large canvas arms of the windmill rotate above his head
the wind blows through his hair
anthony reaches up and waves his hand of his eyes
now the seer can only see what god wants him to
forty years on a planet of monks and ive finally found religion
a floor board creaks
anthony strains to hear john
he knows it is not
well come then
i havent got forever
a shadow falls across his face
he can feel it
he doesnt have to see what is here
the leather boat makes its way across the sea
john rows while ripley holds the torch aloft
as night falls she takes the oars
the ocean is dead calm
the coracle glides across the glass like surface
john flexes his scarred fingers
your hands okay
theyll be fine
youve been on a boat before
ripley squints ahead of them
the ocean seems to go on forever
i was a warrant officer on a ship but i did all my sailing in space
father anselm used to take me on his coracle when i was little
ripley leans forward scans his face
how old were you when they towed this satellite out here
the abbot said they put us to sleep for the thirty years it took to get here
weve had almost forty more
what happened to your mother
never had one
i mean never knew her
i mean i did once
she left my father when he joined the movement
if she hadnt i wouldnt be here
they kept the other children with the women on earth
that was too long ago now
like a dream
ripleys face grows strangely dark
she turns to the water
did you know that i was a mother
the girl in the ship with
i never mentioned my daughter
i have had i guess by now a daughter on earth
she was nine when i signed on to the nostromo
mommy will be home before you know it i said
my shares would have set us up good
then i lost sixty years floating around in a rescue pod
thanks to the alien
i came home to face a bitter year old woman
a little girl whos mother never came home
they said i should have been happy to be alive
thats why i went back the second time
not so i could fight it you cant fight it so i could let it kill me
she rubs her chest you didnt choose to get lost in space
thanks for the try father brother
brother but im not looking for absolution
i couldnt be a good mother to my daughter
i couldnt be a good mother to newt
but i can be a good mother to you
i can make sure you survive
suddenly they feel rain ripley holds out her hand
her eyes open wide at what she sees
john takes the oars as she holds the torch over the side the ocean has become red with blood
blood drips down from the ceiling around them
john looks up
from the levels above
his face goes white
he must have slaughtered all dont think about it
dont think about whats up there
as ripley takes the torch away from the water tiny ripples move across the surface
she doesnt notice
passes underneath the boat
a swimming creature
thanks to the reflective qualities of water it appears huge
dwarfs their coracle
all the windmills are burning
flaming arms lazily turning
anthony is not in sight
another dock with ladders going up and down
ripley and john climb out of the coracle
dont waste time tying off
they go a hundred foot climb
the wood is twisted
rungs have been torn away in some places
they pull themselves up sections that have only the tiniest foothold
the temperature rises as they do
sweat runs into their eyes
soon they can see the floor above them blackened by intense heat
ripley and john come up from the level below
john crosses himself
another testament to the terrible battle with the alien
reduced to just a huge blackened floor
all the crops burned to ash their charred stalks mingled with the corpses of roasted monks
their nostrils assailed by the stench of the dead ripley would puke if she had any food in her body
were right below the abbey now
they cross the smoldering field
the scorched floor threatens to give way under johns feet ripley pull him to one side
heaven has become hell
the ground the buildings the sky timber all blackened
fires burn everywhere
air choked with gray smoke and dust pouring in from the orbiters surface through rends in the vaulted ceiling
climb through a hole where a trap door has been torn off its hinges
they look at the grim tableau monks impaled on their own pikes
tangled together in their own pungy stakes
alien cocoon material cobwebbed over their bodies
flickering fires lit the first few floor windows
ripley takes a step towards it reaches back and pulls john
the glass furnace boils almost to the point of overflow
small fires burn out of control around the room
finished glass pieces burst from the heat
ripley and john enter
this is the glassworks
they have tools here spots kyle he runs across the room sits calmly at the marver table
he places playing cards on the table in front of him
he sings to himself quietly
sotto cant see my baby
dont see my baby
john grabs him by the lapels pulls him to his feet
the playing cards fall to the floor kyle watches them not john
cards on the floor fifty two pickup
black king on red queen put the ace up john shakes him
ripley moves closer
john its too late kyle begins to sing faster
put the ace up
pup pup pup chaka boomloommawhacka booomalooma looma ripley and john look at each other
they know what this means
john pulls a length of rope off a nearby table
moves in front of kyle
looks into his glassy eyes
a tear runs down his cheek
keep singing my friend
john loops the rope around kyles neck
eases the lifeless body to the floor
stares at it
pulls a blowing iron from the rack
feels its weight and balance
a reasonable weapon
she crosses to john
i killed him
im a doctor and i killed him
you had to
youre supposed to end suffering
she hands him a pontil a pointed iron spear used to form the molten glass shapes
lets get the hell out of here
ripley and john move up the stairs
flickering orange lit from below
smoke and soot rise from the first on the lower floors
they enter carefully
the room is exactly as john left it books out of shelves hanging on their chains
hes made a mess
john pushes ahead of her
he hasnt been up here yet
i did this
he moves to the nearest shelf and uses his pontil to pry open the lock here philosophy well start here a hairy blur flies out from between the stacks whumph
knocks john to the floor licks his face
the happy dog leaps all over his master
ripley this is mattias
ripley crosses to them
but weve probably only got a few minutes before this entire place goes up in flames
just grab whatever books you want and ripley leans in to pet mattias
mattias draws his lip back
hes looking over ripleys shoulder
she turns around slowly
standing in the open doorway
its in bad shape from the man traps
lost a foot
tongue hanging out useless
parts of it look like wood
parts of it look like wheat
it carries anthonys waterlogged limp body pops off his head like a grape from the bunch
tosses the corpse at ripleys feet
i could swear its trying to smile
back against the book stacks
john grabs mattias collar
the dog growls at the alien intruder
is there another way out
not that will do us any good
limps into the room dragging one foot
its breathing is labored
dripping acid blood leaves a thin trail of fire behind it
we hurt it
the alien draws itself up to its full height even wounded it is one dangerous mother fucker
you wanna give it a bandage
look where is my ship from here
on the roof directly above this room
heres the plan but the books forget the books
mattias pulls free from johns grasp runs to the alien shit
snaps and barks at the alien leaping about to dodge its claws
draws its attention run at the alien
it is trying to spear the dog with its tail
john swings the iron rod thwap
hits the alien across the back of its bulbous head it turns to him ripley shoves the blowing iron into the aliens torso
his acid blood spurts out the end of the hollow tube splatters ripleys cassock she tears it off john grabs mattias pulls him back
the alien spins in a circle blood spraying around him creating a circle of fire about him igniting the books no
john steps forward ripley grabs for him the acid eats through the wooden floor the alien john and ripley plummet down
through the next floor the alien falls into the molten glass vat screeches arms flailing as it sinks beneath the surface of the thousand degree liquid
finds himself hanging over the bubbling glass vat caught dangling on the flying fox rope
five feet away the ledge the flying fox is launched from
he looks down he can see the huge open vat of molten glass below him
to its right the water dump tank a large wine cask looking affair where finished pieces are cooled
he looks up ripley holding onto the edge of the broken floor above
are you all right
ripley grunts an affirmative response
at least is she falls it will only be a twenty foot drop to the floor
john is looking at instant par boiling
john starts to move hand over hand up the rope
he begins to sweat
a drop of sweat falls
pops and sizzles as it hits the surface of the molten glass tries to pull herself up to the floor above the next level is a raging fire
she can only hang and drop
falls the two stories
bends her knees and rolls on impact
has reached the ledge overlooking the furnace
sees ripley slowly rising ripley
ripley shakily gets to her feet
hops on one foot
lets get the fuck out of the aliens head breaks the surface of the molten glass
it is white hot translucent covered with it looks like molten glass
hook like hands grasp the edge of the tank it tries to climb out ripley turns to run
tender ankle gives out
she falls face down on the floor rolls over the alien is going to climb out of the vat she screams grabs the flying fox handle
swings down the rope across the room past the alien it turns away from ripley she scrambles across the floor
john lands hard
points ripley the lever
ripley looks next to her a burning wooden lever
the alien has one foot out of the glass furnace ripley grabs the lever hssssst
putting out the fire with her hand pulls dumps
empties a thousand gallons rains down on the alien
it howls in pain the molten glass instantly cools the rapid extreme temperature change causes the beast to be thwoooooooom
explode into a million pieces
ripley helps john off the floor
they are battered
they look into the vat
the steam clears
the room is littered with alien bits
each piece is encased in glass trapped like a fly in amber
saw that happen to a bottle once
beat him ugh she grabs her stomach as her knees give out
john gives her an arm for support
weve got to get to the library dont worry
just they look up mattias looks down through the hole in the floor
every bookshelf ablaze
the floor dotted with pools of flame
ripley and john are at the door held back by the heat john tries to enter the room ripley grabs him dont be stupid some of them
ive got to save some of them
mattias yelps in response
threads his way through to them
ripley spins him to face her
tears stream down his cheeks
you did your best
if you get out it wasnt in vain
weve got to live
she yanks him into the hallway ripleys good foot kicks down the burning planks that surround the escape ship
john and mattias stand behind as she climbs through to the ship
john looks around the abbey level is devastated
the air is filled with smoke
the abbey is burning
the library is in flames
john looks down at his medical bag
torn bloody scorched it still hangs from his shoulders
inside the only remaining book
come on in
john and mattias step through ripley clicks on the lights
john lifts mattias into the hatch
the library i told you the earth is still there ripley checks an instrument elapsed travel time
her brows knit
she taps the gauge
what does that mean
it means i dont know how long i was in hyper sleep
it means the abbot couldve been right it means my clock isnt working
we have to get out of here
even if he was right this ships onboard computer is filled with mans knowledge
some things will be lost forever
then man starts over
hes done it before
she pushes a few buttons
somewhere under the floor a propulsion source hums to life
throbbing through the soles of johns feet
ripley is absorbed in her work
the seals werent broken so were probably clear
but those dead monks out there are going to start hatching soon
lets get ready to take off
what can i do
here i need a compressor tank from in that compartment
she motions towards an open door
john enters the compartment
the door closes behind him
he looks out the window in the door
ripley is staring at him punching keys on a pad next to the door
hey im locked in
mattias scratches at the door
i locked you in
im not going with you
ive got one inside me
you cant she runs a hand across her midsection
i figured it out
thats why it didnt kill me
he must have impregnated me when i was in the stasis tube
remembers nightmare it hasnt come out yet because i havent eaten its still dormant
so either i eat and it kills me or i dont eat and i starve to death
either way i die
john pulls the medieval tome out of his medical bag
my book i know what to do what an exorcism
you cant do this
ripley listen to me youre confusing feeling of guilt for actual sin i can help you ignoring ive set a time lock
when the pod escapes the colonys gravitational pull this compartment will open
then all you have to do is get into the stasis tube with mattias and press the blue button
with any luck a freighter or something will pick you up
he pounds his fists against the door
no goddammit you cant do this
you cant let it win
she turns away from the door
it always wins
we killed it but its still inside me youre my last chance
if i can keep you alive itll make up for all those ive lost
listen to me
you have to let me try
ripley youre my only chance
i told you father anselm raised me
he raised me and when he was dying i couldnt do anything to save him
i didnt know enough
it was my fault he died
if you dont let me try to save you my body will live but my soul will be dead
ripley turns and stares at him
a monk vomits up the devil
pull back as john lowers ripley to the pod floor
john closes his eyes
closes the book
he pours some water into a small plastic cup
retrieves a small pouch of herbs
wrinkles his nose they smell pours these ancient medicines into the space age cup
what is this stuff
forceful something that will make you well
something that will make you sick
i dont shut up and drink
he lifts the back of ripleys head forces the drink down her throat
john swings his leg over her midsection
presses his two hands together in prayer
then balls them into one fist
takes a deep preparatory breath
ripley starts to gag cough
her body starts to jerk john brings his fist down into her stomach ripley convulses has the dry heaves john pummels ripleys diaphragm
she sputters vomits a thick mucous like substance ripleys back arches she screams a gut wrenching wail her torso bulges as the creature is forced upwards
john bears down pushes up under her ribs forcing the chest burster up her throat ripley fights for air as the alien stops halfway up her esophagus shes choking john
crosses himself takes a deep breath lowers his mouth to hers inhales
slithers out of ripleys mouth reptilian tail whips about before disappearing down his gullet
john falls back against a computer console
fights to speak
ripley raises herself up on one elbow
alien mucous drooling down her chin
hair matted against her forehead
it was the only way
he drops the open book in front of her she sees the etching
gulps back the oozing slime
struggles to his feet
but you ripley tries to stand to go after him she cant sit up feels like a rib might be cracked
youll die john stumbles to the pod door
if we were right heaven
if we were wrong either way where we belong
world of books
he draws the parchment out of his bag
drops it to the floor
are from the real world
he starts to step through the door mattias tries to follow
stay both of you
he exits the pod
ripley drags herself across the floor
to the door
looks out dawns rays are peeking through the battered ceiling as he walks slowly across the smoking roof
into the inferno that is the burning abbey
ripley watches as john and the alien horror inside him are the heat of the flames grows
she must pull back reaches up for the door handle
it closes with a thud
she rolls onto her back
for the first time in years
shes been absolved
the escape pod shifts
ripleys eyes snap open the roof beneath the pod is beginning to give way
ripley rolls onto her stomach and drags herself to the pilots chair
pulls herself into the seat
straps herself in blasts through the wooden outershell of the orbiter arceon
roars towards us past us
ripley places mattias into the hyper sleep tube
rubs under his chin
is about to climb in with him when she spots something on the floor ripley picks it up and unrolls it
she hears johns voice i brother john goldman of the orbiter arceon minorite abbey and gaol know the abbot was wrong
there is a great evil here
i have seen it
i put pen to paper now lest this plague this creature stills my hand
i have gone down below both to try to warn the others and get the woman ripley get from her some clue as to how to battle this evil or
at least to make my peace for not defending her
she believes there is still and earth and i hope she is right
i hope she will be able to find out
i hope she can find some rest for the devils that torment her
ripley looks at the elapsed time counter on the command console
pulls a pen from its holder
she adds whether the earth exists or not whether we end up in heaven or hell or the cold vacuum of space she has
she sets her course
gets back into her tube
closes the lid
the escape pod moves through the jet black void
dwindles into the darkness behind her a smouldering slowly dying ember
teenager in the back of the movie theater shouts its in the dog
