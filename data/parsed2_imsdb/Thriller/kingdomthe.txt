written by were in a kindergarten classroom of six year olds
all sitting on the floor legs crossed
sitting in front of the kids is little kevin fleury flanked by his mom lyla fleury and his dad ronald fleury in a dark suit
little kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it
hes telling the class about the photos

tight on the young faces
tight on fleury

the kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get closer to the pictures
miss ross the pretty twenty five year old teacher watches from the side
wheres your gun
yeah where is your gun
pretty much all the kids get in on this now
everyone wants to see fleurys gun
fleury makes eyes at miss ross
shes giving him a no fucking way hard eye
im assuming that there are no bad guys in this room
isnt that right
i mean are you guys good guys or bad guys
so why would i have brought my gun to a room full of good guys
this silences the class
miss ross keeps things moving pointing to a photo
whats that picture
this is me and my dad playing battleship at my dads apartment
micks hand goes back up
what is a battleship
abruptly my parents are divorced
lyla and ron look down at kevin stalled
but thats ok cause the most important thing is to know that everybody loves each other
this hits a bit hard on lyla and ron
miss ross jumps in
so whos that in that picture up on top
thats my fish his name is jaws and hes a really mean fish
kevin is still going strong
my mommy is a think tank worker and she is really really smart
she went to two colleges and has three computers
kevins pointing to a picture of ronald holding him as a tiny newborn
this is the day that my daddy says is the happiest day of his life
his happiest day
can you tell us about that day mr
fleury smiles looks out at the class
i sure can
that was december th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of kevins moms
and we waited and waited but he wouldnt come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said ok
hes not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him
and well fleury stops checks in with miss ross
can i tell this story
go for it
ronald fleury so they take her and put her on a special bed and they give her some medicine so she doesnt feel any pain then they take out this
tiny little knife and make a tiny little cut right here in her tummy
the kids are mesmerized
then what happened
ronald fleury then the doctor put her hands way up into kevins moms tummy
and then you know what they did
a little girl lu lu wide eyed what did they do
they started to pull and pull and pull
they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said stop
the class is frozen
fleury has them
they stopped pulling and the doctor looked up at me and said hey mr
fleury you ready to have your world rocked
and i just stared at her and she pulled this little head up out of that belly
and it was him
and i looked down at him and screamed kevin
and he looked down at me and screamed daddy
the kids are howling
a muslim family sits together at a table under a tented canopy year old man nervously chewing on a toothpick and his and year old sons
the yo leans his weight into an old man hunched and obscured by his grandson this is his grandfather
he gently rubs the boys head with an ancient left hand
the boy finger paints in arabic script right to left getting paint on the table
read the translation there is no god but allah
the grandfathers face is down obscured by his shumagh the head wrap worn by some muslim men
never a clear view of his face
his year old son and eldest grandson sit next to them the son talking quietly on a cell phone chewing that toothpick eyes set on something in the distance a
security gate three hundred yards away the entrance to some sort of compound
the compound looks like a walled off subdivision most of which we can see from this high up
the landscape is foreign
ten miles beyond on the horizon the shimmer of a modern skyline
surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat
muted yells claps screams waft in from that compound now
catches the youngest grandsons attention
eyes lift up from his painting the yells claps screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the compounds reinforced walls that extend a mile in each direction
played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage
sounds from the softball game much louder now just over the walls
security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate
a maze of concrete jersey barriers to slow all entering vehicles give machine gun emplacements flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles if need be
middle eastern police platoons
lift gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through
sergeant haytham a lean year old middle eastern policeman in command of the entrance
sweats through his uniform
a late model range rover with blacked out windows queues up
all the windows roll down just a single portly white woman behind the wheel her infant child in a car seat in front
two other uniformed officers mirror scan the bottom of the rover
a brief exchange as haytham checks his id how are you today sergeant
sun is shining
wind is blowing
how bad can i be doing
i like that sun is shining
a tight smile from haytham
the other officers are checking the inside of the rover now
they nod to haytham haytham hands the id back to her
windows rolls up
lift gate goes up
range rover pulls away navigating the zig zag jersey barriers
stay with the range rover as it moves deeper into the complex
think middle class phoenix suburb circa stucco homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks concrete and rock where grass should be
the range rover passes a tank with a caged soldier on top sitting behind a fifty caliber gun
a police land cruiser parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security
official markings emergency lights in the grill
the son studies the compound through binoculars while the youngest grandson squints to study the softball game interest cut with jealousy
more muted cheers float
behind and above him his grandfathers voice rough as sand to his year old son in arabic hang up the phone
if theyre not ready now no words will change it
another middle eastern policeman takes in the motley competition half smiling half smirking at a plump pink white man cheering on his plump pink year old son sliding into third
clapping and hoots
the pitcher an older white man in his middle forties visibly frustrated
a year old african american batter steps to the plate now
pitcher turns to his fielders back the batter ready for my knuckle curve
the batter just stays focused as the pitcher tosses a high lob
batter smacks the ball a mile high deep to left
the teammates of the plump pink boy on third spins points up at the ball a year old indian girl sprints underneath the fly ball sets up catches it juggles
it drops it
we pick up different families on the grass nearby a young woman helps her five year old daughter untangle a yo yo
a black couple doing a crossword puzzle together the wifes head on her husbands lap
the muted reaction to the dropped ball
the whole family save the youngest grandson intently focused on two officers walking up to that police land cruiser parked in the middle of the road well inside the compound
no blinks now
the youngest still enthralled by the softball game the cheers the running the shorts and t shirts
we see his grandfathers left hand stop rubbing the boys head and move to the boys temple placed like a blinder so he cant see whats about to happen
in arabic dont stop watching the game
noises from the softball game close again
track these two officers on foot walking toward the police land cruiser ala shift change nonchalant but quick
the driver eyeing the two approaching officers something off about them
uniforms wrinkled one with a full beard
driver turns to his partner in arabic you have a copy of the duty rost pop pop pop before the driver finishes
the officers on foot rapid firing mm pistols
the driver and passenger hit multiple times instantly crumble lifeless in their seats before anyone has time to process the sounds link them to an attack
the two firing officers move low fast like professionals rip the fresh bodies from the cruiser jump in
the new passenger rips an ar rifle off the center console
the new driver lays rubber into the compound
the youngest grandson wide eyed startled watches as every member of the security details in and around the compound go prairie dog search with necks extended eyes wide what the
fuck was that
the boy tries to turn his head away from the game to look for himself grandfather just pushes his head back to the game voice harder now in arabic i
said keep watching the game
haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby police land cruiser as most everyone else ducks
in arabic then points at the officer in the drivers seat game forgotten
parents up screaming for loved ones moving fast toward the parking lot
the middle eastern officer that has been watching the game hustles onto the field next to the pitcher waves people toward him
gathering but sporadic gun fire in very near distance
accented english people immediately flocking around the authority figure
the year old indian girl running in more puzzled than scared why is that cop wearing a jacket in this heat
the officer rips a yellow gun shape from his jacket pocket
the pitcher sees it instinctively tries to rip it away from him
gets a handful of collar pulls as violently as he can shreds the front of the officers coat a white linen vest with a bulge in front underneath the jacket
the youngest grandsons wide eyed face
then we see the grandfathers right hand slide down the other side of his youngest grandsons face coming to rest on his other temple making sure hes still watching the
softball diamond now
the grandfathers right hand missing an index and middle finger
the officer swings the yellow gun shape what we now realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something else bashes the pitchers face with it
those that had gathered have turned are sprint stumbling away
the officer closes his eyes depresses the drill trigger vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue black chaos expanding in an ever wider sphere
immediate surroundings dissolve players parents stands cars the light standards surrounding the field and parking lot
located behind straight a way center field at the nexus of four fields
we see it from profile as shock wave and shrapnel blast the structure another officer hiding behind it staggers out now sprawls ugly balance fucked from a blown inner ear
he also wears a jacket and holds a modified yellow plastic power drill
moves uneasy toward screams in the nearby parking lot
the off balance officer stops over a year old african american woman pinned under a toyota
she hyperventilates her bare leg and open toed sandal kick at air
the officers breathing calms the sight of exposed skin as divine reassurance
close up the vented rear of the drill as the
volt motor sparks blue
a second blue black explosion that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another desperate to escape
panicked women walking dogs
a police land cruiser with bullet scarred windows roars around the corner
stops near the women
they smile cavalry to the rescue
then a man with leans out the window with an ar point blank staccato
tracers exit bodies drill asphalt
the land cruiser rolls spraying passing homes indiscriminate
tearing through the streets passenger firing at all signs of life
sits back for a lightning quick re load
leans back out before he can begin firing again another police land cruiser from nowhere hammers their drivers side
the passenger is launched out his window head first into the curb
both vehicles smoke screech
momentary pause after the a massive collision
then sergeant haytham mm in hand falls from the second land cruiser
stalks bloody to the passenger side of the jacked land cruiser still slowly rolling backwards leaking all its vital fluids its snapped drive shaft leaving a groove in the pavement
and sergeant haytham empties his clip into the interior while walking along side
the officer haytham told to move rips himself from the passengers side of their vehicle bleeding profusely screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio
just the youngest grandsons horrified eyes he had no choice but to see it all carnage painted permanently
his face still held tight between his grandfathers hands
in arabic our time is not a peaceful one
god has left it to us to make it so
hold on those deep young brown eyes
those young brown eyes finally blink
everyone eats snacks that the fleurys brought
kevins the center of attention
fleurys passing out juice boxes
fleurys cell phone vibrates
tight on the id
fleurys mid juice pass answering his phone at the same time
kevin looks to his dad already grimacing
fleury walks away from the kids
we hear frans voice as though were on the line with him raspy ragged like hes been crying
you getting this yet
hey im at kevins school
whats goin on
im sorry brother
fleurys demeanor shifts to hard immediately
the al rahmah western housing compound
oil company employees
hit a company picnic
blew up a softball game
tears kids brother
fleury looks at the kids eating and laughing
fleury smiles best he can at his son
into the phone when
just went off twenty minutes ago
a shooter crew as diversion
its just awful
fran im rollin right now
let me call you back i gotta ring bells go

fleury hangs up walks to kevin kneels down oblivious to everyone watching
son i gotta go to work

points to the phone who was that
big fran you remember him
beat thinking uncle fran
put peanuts in his coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time

beat something bad
impression of his dad lotta bad people out there
smiles already homesick i love you
kisses his boys forehead hard
you gonna go see him
im gonna try
looks at lyla whos been through this drill too many times knows this face
ronald can only give a little shrug which lyla gives right back
to lyla can you get a ride
she nods yes
miss ross nearby surprised by this wheres your husband going
ex husband and god knows
then a wave of fear ripples across her face
she hesitates then calls after him ronald turns gives a little cheshire grin puts the phone back up to his ear
the shattered softball diamond and parking lot
emergency lights swirl from everywhere
francis manner fbi legat us embassy is giant
the kind of american that only grows in tiny southern hamlets
military whitewalls short sleeves khaki dockers a thick casio g shock fbi credentials visible on a chain
hangs up his phone
lifts his eyes hell from one side of the frame to the other
saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent
columns of black smoke
fleets of emergency vehicles
another in bio suits combing the ball field the parking lot
fran has to do something anything
move through the horror with him now
his hands shake his face already dirty with soot
jumps in with a saudi team pulling a half burned woman out of a smoldering range rover
she fights them gouging frans face trying to get back in
she is the woman we met at the gate of the compound
she wants her baby
fran bloodied just kind of steps away from the woman
leaves the saudi emergency team to fight with her
backs away until he feels grass under his feet
the womans screams reverberate
fran just sits in the grass
staring at the woman her shattered soul
forces himself to look away
eyes come to rest on a childs baseball cap ragged holes ringed with black stains where blood dried on the blue felt
immediately behind fran
you gotta stand big man
fran turns to find rex burr fireplug
a long silence
fran points to the hat rex how old were you when your hat was that small
we watch tears well in rexs eyes
you gotta stand big man
wipes his hands on his pants
slack jaw hopeless
the first moments in what will be weeks of reverse engineering the murders of unknown dozens
he and rex step to a group of walking wounded
a neighbor doles out mugs of coffee
most everyone from the compound is out pondering the proximity
saudi emergency teams sprint past
fran spits settles in we need to get everyone back then get all their something huge explodes over their shoulders yards away
the attacks coup de grace wait for people to lift up their heads hit them again
five times the size of the suicide bombs
shreds emergency vehicles nearby homes and apartment buildings
kills saudi rescuers by the bushel
fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard
rex is blown into the man handing out coffee
the walking wounded get decimated
slowly lift up and hold on al rahmah as it burns
black smoke and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace explosion
fleury sits with glenda manner
a toy remote control robot comes into the room
little teddy manner peeks his head around the corner of a door
i dont know what time it was
the dishwashers broken
i was waiting for the dishwasher
the doorbell rang i thought it was
it wasnt the dishwasher guy
glenda breaks down starts to completely lose it
her little boy teddy climbs up onto his mother
fleury sits on the bed with little teddy looking at a beautiful black and white photo of fran holding a new born teddy up over his head
eye to eye
little teddy shows fleury his toy helicopter
his dads soldier boots
fleury cant take it
fleury stands with glenda
glenda i want you to look at me
a pause fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion struggling to contain himself
im going to take care of this
whoever did this
i give you my word
whoever did this will pay
i cant change this but i can promise you that i will make someone pay for this
startling quiet in contrast
agents cluster beneath inch televisions suspended from the ceiling
tuned to al jazeera cnn bbc etc
most eyes focus on the double bloody scoops from cnn
volume low hour ago blasts in saudi arabia in or around the al rahmah western housing complex near riyadh
more than feared dead including children
the saudi foreign minister has released a statement calling this a heinous act possibly committed by foreigners
homes to thousands of westerners and other non saudis who work in the kingdom there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years
as such they have become very tight in terms of security with both the saudi national guard and police taking command
fleury walks under the televisions
a folder in hand heading down a long hallway subordinating his fury to tasks at hand
fleury enters steps to a podium opens his folder
agents seated lecture hall style
steam from fifth sixth cups of coffee
plasma screens behind show still images of the crime cribbed from al jazeera
throughout the scene fleury constantly refers to a roster of his erts
numbers so far dead injured
the target was a softball game
rumor is the killers wore saudi police uniforms
beat special agent fran manner was killed
janet mayes years old stifles a sob in the front row
fleury steps from behind the podium puts a hand gently on janets shoulder leans in and whispers something no one but janet hears
whatever his words they give back her composure
so was rex burr from state
fleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium
no one says a thing
fleury lifts his eyes again real trouble maintaining control
fran was the best among us
well feel this loss the rest of our days
beat moment to regroup grant take stabs at bomb sizes
virginia state trooper before joining the fbi
law and order formidable sharp smart charlottesville accent
studies the images for a beat
from the craters looks like they used a high explosive
possibly military grade cant fit that much tnt into a vest
pounds of petn they got it
semtex or c they could get it
the third there god knows
that crater looks like a plane dropped a pounder
obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene
dont know anything about where or what it was yet
this is how they do it
years old sought after investigator
theres a constant intense grind to this guy a mind and mouth incapable of quiet
he paces around the room then eagle eyes the bomb images
starts surge scrawling crude diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf
feels more like nervous doodling than work
not looking up from his drawing i already know the answer but any chance in hell we get to go over there use our hands
if you already know the answer adam why ask the question
fleury circles leavitts name on the roster
leavitt never stops drawing
were not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else
these aint hot wired artillery shells waiting for humvees to roll by
pointing at the screens these hits are coordinated planning timing and big broad daylight balls almost trance studying the images yeah so
did they all happen during daylight
another great question
fleury looks over to agent on his immediate right an egg head type with a big binder in front of him
everyones eyes follow
agent flips quickly through the binder back and forth searching
fleury crosses his name off of his roster
at least the first parts of the attacks
everyone smells it thats big more proof these attacks are being carried out by one very skilled terror cell
we had two others
north of riyadh and the oil thing
what was that
ras tenura refinery
yeah south of jeddah
same thing daylight suicide bombers
followed by machine gun crews
collect and kill
this is not new in concept
it is new in scope
command and control was flawless
they found the largest kill zone they could and they did it
they did it by being patient
any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks
fleury circles mayes name on the ert roster
from memory no
i know this is the first for that
thats worst case scenario if youre still asking for my stab sir
a crew who can build bombs this big with this level of eyes on control and detonation coordination
has access to saudi uniforms now
anyone take credit
fleury checks from his notes
saudi al qaeda
bin laden wanna be
we know he was in afghanistan then moved to iraq
now he seems to have come home
hes clearly becoming increasingly active
if it is hamza hes definitely turning up the volume over there
not to beat a dead horse sir but if there was ever a time to get boots on saudi sand
sykes studies leavitt with what is best described as substantial skepticism
fleury circles sykes name on his roster
they cant afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control
they lose control over their country their people
then they risk losing control over the oil
they wont let us in
his open folder on the podium
a memo printed on department of state letterhead
pulls the memo reads it aloud calm laced with rage
from the state department one hour ago we are in agreement with the saudi security assessment that any additional american presence on kingdom soil represents reckless risk
therefore it is the secretary of states position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained should the federal bureau of investigation activate rapid deployment
folding the memo the national security advisor and the attorney general agreed
beat im going to get us access
keep your go bags hot
its gonna come fast
leavitt stares at fleury as he moves fast out of the room
i guess hes gonna go get us some access
beat hows he gonna do that
sykes just hard eyes leavitt
colonel al ghazi saudi police years old mustache as thick as sykes
a firecracker loud crack makes him flinch
he stands in the back of the room not participating in the interrogation
clearly not happy about what hes observing
his pov the officer from the second land cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside sergeant haytham
slab cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick fisted saudis
silent tears roll off his cheek left ear split ghastly
a man standing far right of him beats him the firecracker sound again
al ghazi looks away biting his tongue
obviously wants this over
in charge of the interrogation general abdul malik
he doesnt appear sadistic but very determined to get the truth from sergeant haytham by any means necessary
those distinctions blur easily
malik gives a hold up signal
the following exchange in arabic no falsehoods sergeant haytham
what was your involvement
killing those i saw responsible
so none could be questioned
puzzled angry i dont understand
a nod from general malik another vicious crack
you were born and raised in suweidi that is not a crime it should be
do you know abu hamza
i do not
your brother was killed fighting the americans
true or false
i am not my brother
your brother i am not my brother
true or al ghazi interrupts
he has answered the question
malik shoots al ghazi a unequivocal shut the fuck up hard eye
then back on haytham
we found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession that is a crime especially when you consider the attackers wore our uniform
another nod another crack
al ghazi flinching becomes more alert
general malik in haythams face truth
ill say it again because it is true
i need more uniforms because i must change during shifts
look at my shirts
i am not interested in your sweat
then look at my jackets
no matter how many times theyre cleaned
colonel al ghazi grimacing now leaves the room
al ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room
finds a locker labelled haytham
pulls out several shirts still in the plastic dry cleaning sheaths yellowed permanent stains on the armpits of each
al ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts lays them down on the table in front of the general all business
hes telling the truth
the only sound for a long unsettled moment sergeant haythams labored breathing
malik looks at the shirts then al ghazi hesitates steps away
you were injured when you used your vehicle to protect your country
do you understand
al ghazi moves in begins uncuffing haythams bloody raw wrists hard eyeing malik the whole time
these men clearly dont like each other
al ghazi and haytham sit alone
al ghazi smokes
haytham looks down at his feet
look at me haytham
haytham slowly looks up at al ghazi
you saved lives today
i believe that
you served your country
i believe that
i love my country
i believe that haytham
haytham holds al ghazis eyes a good long beat
i love my country
al ghazi slow nods
beat breaks eye contact you will have your revenge for what needed to be done to assure them you werent involved
haytham never blinks
grace looks like a barrel chested lineman
a four man security detail behind
he and ronald fleury walk side by side
janet mayes just behind them
everyones terrified so nothing moves
you and your team arent going anywhere
beat and this meeting is just a circle jerk ronnie attorney general youngs going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal
well be on record but expect nothing more
nothing from fleury
can you handle this
keep your mouth shut when people way above you say things youll hate
beat yeah sure
re janet what about agent mayes
to janet what about you
ill be fine
fleury grace and mayes enter
handsomely decorated expansive a lifetime of notable handshakes framed in black and white
the biggest is a picture of young and billy graham that could be titled lucky for you we have all the answers
gideon young sits behind his federalist era oak desk a marathoners build a smile too bright perfect for his age
two others in attendance
a pear shaped year old man with a midwest honest ruddy oval face ellis leach assistant secretary bureau of near eastern affairs department of state and a year old hispanic
woman in conservative chanel enough femininity without diminishing toughness maricella canavesio deputy national security advisor white house i apologize if were late they were early
you know special agent fleury
this is agent janet mayes shes one of our arabic experts
janet stares at young looking mildly in over her head
grace sits nods to fleury youre up
two suicide bombers
rumors they were dressed as saudi police
we believe this is the work of saudi terrorist named abu hamza
young just stares at fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at a mushroom flavored popsicle
fleury continues a shooter crew served as distraction
after the initial attack there was a lull to allow saudi emergency teams
and our own attaches
then a secondary blast was triggered aimed at those first responders
so they targeted families and rescuers with one attack
mildly sarcastic i think thats a clear signal that their definition of enemy is expanding
let us never forget how cheap life is over there
i have seven minutes before my next meeting so whos talking first
to fleury and grace slow like a kindergarten teacher you two digested the memo
stoic nods from each
ellis leach raises his hand a tone thats worlds away from youngs
ill go first if thats okay maricella
off her yeah sure nod first im sorry about fran manner
gideon young remembers nods along solemnly
as we are about rex burr
i met with prince thamer at the saudi embassy fifteen minutes after i heard this mornings news
after speaking with thamer i advised we withhold additional us personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current us personnel
more boots on saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so
i know thats not the answer you want but
motions to maricella the floor is yours
my two cents the saudis havent asked for fbi help
sounds like theyve done just the opposite
if we force the issue that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a mile long border with iraq
to grace and fleury its all rock solid logic
beat we would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go thats not going to happen young stands were done
fleurys look thats it
youngs already collecting his briefcase jacket mock sincerity to the room so as we present this to the public lets as best we can try to view this through an
fbi agents eyes
to grace and please let me know if theres anything else we can do for you
meeting seems over
fleury cant keep his mouth shut
sir how would you imagine it looks viewed through an fbi agents eyes
im interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes
young eyes on a republican gold rolex instantly perturbed the meeting isnt ending
its some variation on vengeance
when one of your own is killed agents lose their analytical powers kind of a greatest strength greatest weakness thing
if i wanted vengeance id have whispered rex burr into elliss ear right when we walked in
beat eyes migrate to fleury this isnt terrorism maam
its just serial murder
whats the distinction
to call this massacre an act of terrorism
that implies a specific political agenda
to me these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic more like charles manson than osama bin laden
fleury looks to mayes
she clears her throat
delivers the following with utter precision
beat fuck it go al qaeda lost the first phase of this war so a new zero sum phase has begun if you wont join us well let loose the
truly talented murderers
he will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the saudi royal family will cause an exodus a rebellion both
because the royal family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer
fleury studies janet with solid respect
he gives janet a subtle nod nice work
when she says talented shes not talking about the walking bombs who can sneak past any and all security nor the hi jackers tough enough to take an airliner
were talking about the man who teaches them how
the operational commander who organizes trains plans encourages
that is who were fighting
if we dont get inside saudi arabia within hours there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for al rahmah
i believe it all
so doesnt your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these masters would die for
trade ten of their own for one of you
to not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying uncle
fleury takes another deep breath
ill say it another way evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours
if we cant get in now we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime
we couldnt do it at khobar we couldnt do it in yemen we have barely scratched the surface in iraq
and we are on verge of not doing it here
they are getting stronger we are getting weaker
i just lost a very good friend and i would very much like to go and do my job
chuckle that was spirited
lets all thank god special agent fleury doesnt make policy decisions
hed turn the fbi into pattons third army
fleury contemplates career ending violence
janet fleury and grace walking the rows of seven foot bronze soldiers
street cart hotdogs from foil wrappers
to fleury i see the look in your eyes
that look is trouble old school play ground shit vengeance
its not vengeance
it aint justice
weve all been there
vengeance is always dirty ronnie
i just cant sit this out
i cant watch this not get dealt with
know what my high school football coach used to say to me
all night long coach bailey would scream hit something
thats good coaching
im fixing to go hit something boss
you with me
how you gonna do it
the saudis covet good pr as much as their oil of hijackers on means most americans will never stop asking if that saudi oil is worth it
its all about press
few more moves and its total war ronnie
the only time treason is palatable is when its done righteously and completely
fleury digesting graces words moments pass
then he looks to janet
oh im in
not a question
im definitely going
elaine flowers senior correspondent washington post coffee ampd deep black raccoon eyes heavy wrinkled khakis
fleury sits across from her
weve entered mid scene whats your take
looks like every overthrow in history once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy the governments days are numbered
white house call you with a spin
we dont talk since i broke the vice presidents guy cooking dirty intel on iran
they hate me
whats up fleury
how hard you gonna hit the royal family in your column tomorrow
with a sledgehammer
with the bombings
or other things
whats other than the bombings
i know youre tracking al haramain
is that what you want to talk about
saudi officials making donations that end up
blowing up trains in paris
buses in london
seems that just might happen
we got some other stuff missing girls out of a houston four seasons hotel that was heavily populated by some saudi officials
flowers eyes go wide
can i take some notes
im not saying that
are you saying anything
i need a favor
i dont do favors ronnie
when its real and it will be real
ill come to you with what we have first
you call thamer at the embassy
tell him that the fbi is getting real close to laying out some major saudi vip indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a boston investment firm
were gonna freeze a lot of saudi cash and roll out some major embarrassment
can i mention houston
its a free world baby
ask him to comment
tell him that im running the investigation
tell him that im not the nicest kid on the block
that would be accurate
i want fifteen minutes with him tonight
and i get what
i come to you first
no one else
whats really going on here ronnie
you going strong over fran manner
fleury just stares at her
im just trying to do my job elaine
ill see what i can do
frenetic doorman valet ballet
black suburbans with red blue diplomatic plates swing onto the round about
a bald waif like year old saudi man gets out of the lead vehicle
fleury waiting outside eyes on his watch
to thamer get back in
a big bodyguard sits up front
fleury sits in back aims the ac vents his way
prince thamer sits next to him
bright lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior
prince thamer looks more than a bit baffled
too many people we both know were at the bar
its a pleasure to meet you your highness
i had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the post
she can be a bit of an exaggerator
im sure things were somewhat over stated
i see myself as friend of saudi arabia
i just need a little cooperation thats all
what kind of cooperation
full cooperation my team cleared to land at prince sultan air base
we want to help in a very muscular way quickly
next month would be as soon as
fleury takes a beat
this goes one of two ways
first the fbi with the white house go on the kind of aggressive pr saudi royal family decaying monarchy bender that just cant help but hurt
and i dont care how many chinese are lined up to buy the oil
you know its gonna hurt
my family is not decaying and then we bring the hammer down hard as hell bust al haramain we got direct links from riyadh two wives donating ten million to
three arab american cultural centers in boston
then what gets kind of not funny is how some of that cash found its way to jakarta and some mosques that have these training camps built right next to
its kinda funny
you got little kids playing over here and some not so little kids playing with guns over here
thats kinda odd
you have no proof of this
were getting there sir
and i havent even brought up the two girls still missing out of houston
this is big
it is real
and i know you only care so much about public american opinion sir
but the story will be covered
thamer is clearly rattled
fleury is starting to crack this man
and this aint the metro section
its above the fold just below the date
words like these get syndicated to papers like the omaha world herald the terrell tribune you ever been to terrell texas
what is your point
fleury looks back to him
last i heard people lost their lives in your country
one of them was a good friend of mine
i want in and i want in immediately
thats a rock solid answer
right now immediately
fleury looks back at the ambassador
a stare down
if your phone doesnt work international you can borrow mine
prince thamer slowly reaches for his phone as fleury opens his door
ill just be right out here
the window rolls down thamer looking up at fleury
the following is fast tight negotiating trying to maintain cool we cannot allow agents
with a man security detail even more armed americans could spark rebellion thats too bad
thats non negotiable
you cannot bring guns into the kingdom
men in saudi police uniforms are why were talking now
they would be hand picked
thats the only hope of this happening
if anything happens to me or my team
its on you
cool it with the john wayne mr
fleury just stares
you can have a week seven day or work week
a faded blue plywood door
no one in sight
on the side of the house a battered satellite dish
a tiny framed saudi national flag in the middle of a wall green with a white sword underlining script that reads there is no god but allah
no other decoration
the none too muffled sounds of traffic a lone window overlooking a four lane boulevard
then the athan call to prayer for the isha last of the five daily prayers trumps the traffic noise
sergeant haytham enters bandaged blank then a small smile crosses his face
an old mans weathered voice in arabic just in time
his father glass frail lying in a bed a small tv nearby on but soundless
haytham goes into a routine rolls out two prayer mats steps to his father reaches down to pick him up
his father readies himself stops everything when he sees the bandages up close the black bruises with outer rings of purple covering of his sons cheek
looks into his boys eyes
haytham not returning the gaze hoists his father into his arms pain shoots up his arms from his damaged wrists
you havent heard about the attack
i choose not to listen anymore
what happened to your face
beat an attack today
look at me
haytham looks into his fathers eyes now
haythams eyes well with tears
after a long silence is this how they now treat the men who protect them
can you look at me
you cannot can you
can you look at yourself
haytham stares at his father
you are protecting the true enemies of god
al ghazi sits on pillows on the living room with his wife and three daughters
a television is on playing man sayarbah al milioun the arabic who wants to be a millionaire
al ghazis children are playing a game with peas trying to guess which one of his hands al ghazi is hiding the pea
when a girl guesses correctly he eats a pea
from outside we hear the call to prayer
al ghazi and his family all move to prayer mats in his living room
haytham continues carrying his father to the prayer mats
gently sets him down kneels down himself carefully rolls his dad to his stomach
then stands to help tuck his father in obvious great arthritic pain into a kneeling prayer position
kisses his father on the top of his head
and both pray
al ghazi praying with his family
a load master buckling down two paletts of shrink wrapped gear in the belly of a c
sykes and leavitt sit on a stack of fbi paletts their feet gently tapping on battered forensic cases
mayes approaches from the parking area
beat re janet what was fran manner to her
he taught her how to shoot she taught him most everything else
beat celebrated graduation at the ihop in town until some townie called janet something
something not very nice
townie didnt see fran coming outta the head
but he definitely felt frans uppercut shatter his jaw
fran didnt get bounced for that
points to fleurys dirty jeep arriving
sac fleury took care of him
if i knew how id be sac sykes
i do know the post in riyadh was part of the deal fleury cut to save frans career
leavitt looks up at mayes as she gets within ear shot plops down next to them
beat what did sac fleury whisper in your ear this morning
smart ass smile grants age is a liability
the three turn as fleury approaches
walking fast clear sense of purpose
thanks for volunteering
actually i didnt volunteer
were going to riyadh
state department said yes
white house said yes
anybody said yes
are we bringing security
fleury walks onto the plane
leaving the three on the tarmac
this is going to suck so bad
and the three follow fleury onto the massive plane
just the lull of jet engines
the big long boring is just beginning
janet and leavitt play scrabble
sykes sits nearby
fleury sits up front wide awake
what can four people do in five days
arent you the one who demanded to go this morning
i meant the fbi
i didnt mean me
small smile from leavitt
the scrabble continues
to janet whats it like on the ground
ill be looked at with what i can only describe as disdain pretty much the entire time were on the ground
kind of like south virginia
go easy on my kin
its a very confused culture
had nothing wanted nothing
sixty years ago they hit oil
simple religious men become trillionaires
a schizophrenic nation is born
the royal family who we back and everyone else
intercut with the scrabble
three suburban convoy turns up a driveway waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive walled palace
two dozen sang troops on security detail
two humvees equipped with anti aircraft missiles parked yards apart
colonel al ghazi out of the middle suburban
frisked by sang rough no love lost
al ghazi is passed to a silent boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea
a mammoth foyer
prince saad bin khaled saudi interior ministry steps out from a foot high doorway nebbish thin bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses
his hand over his stomach napoleons ulcers
a quick wave to al ghazi
x gold glass desk over a x rug in a x marble room
al ghazi greets the prince formally kiss the right shoulder near the clavicle
the princes tongue chalk white for some reason
in arabic four fbi agents will be allowed to land at prince sultan air base this evening
al ghazi more than mild shock
general abdul malik chief of investigative services for the national guard has been put in charge of solving this crime
clearly not sitting well with al ghazi
i know the general
i attended his interrogation of one of my men
beat putting it kindly the general does not have investigative experience
attackers wore your uniform
some of your men may have been involved with this cell may still be involved
youre lucky to have a role at all
al ghazi silent
the prince pulls an anti acid tablet puts it in his mouth thats why his tongue is chalk white
and your role will be critically important make sure the americans leave our country as alive as when they arrive
five days they will be our guests
final descent beginning
more stars above than lights below
landing in the middle of nowhere
sykes sitting near fleury getting his game face on
whats going on in there
getting his bearings im good
sykes puts his hand on fleurys chest
feels like you got a beast in there fleury
beat im good good is am sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed buries himself into you
suns creeping through the windows soft
birds and wind chimes
a beat as fleury looks at sykes
you dont think im ok
small smile i think youre not entirely clear right now
thats ok but you got to know that
you want to go we go
i got you but you got to check yourself
im just checking that you checked
fleury stands up
fleury pops his head into the cockpit
two airforce pilots sit at the controls
how we doing
about a half hour out
they gonna let us land
weve been talking to them about an hour or so
they know were coming
you dont mind my asking but what the hell you all gonna be doing down there
i think of hunting i think quail in tennessee deer in pennsylvania
what kind of hunting you all gonna do in saudi
big game hunting
prince sultan air base saudi arabia
our c touches down smooth on saudi soil
engines winding down to nothing
the team standing slinging bags over their shoulders
groggy but pumped
fleury looks at his team last bit of advice before game time
heads on a swivel
the cargo door locks into place on saudi tarmac
fleury and the team outside the plane now bags dropped at their feet
degrees even this late
look up light washing over a small formal saudi military team in front of two caskets draped in american flags and a small convoy of bullet proof black suburbans
adam leavitt will never forget this first glimpse of saudi arabia surreal
tears in janets eyes as she glimpses the caskets
colonel al ghazi steps up offers his hand to fleury
fleury and al ghazi shake colonel al ghazi
special agent ronald fleury
beat the caskets your two fallen comrades mr
manner and mr
three men multi task hustle to forklifts start them up
into the cargo hold pulling out paletts
things moving orderly fast now
the americans just kind of step back dazed
passports and credentials
sergeant haytham driving one of the suburbans steps forward with kevlar vests for our crew
thank you to keep these on whenever you are outside of al rahmah
we brought our own
the crew hits their bags pulls out their vests
another officer checks each team members fbi badge and passport
stops at leavitts an israeli stamp on his passport
leavitts quick israeli stamp in my passport
in arabic to the officer that is not our concern
al ghazi takes the passports and badges hands them back
im also to collect your sidearms
this is like handing over your first born
fleury goes first
haytham puts each weapon in a padded case
and i usually just toss it on the kitchen table
small smile if each of you would please get into the middle vehicle
the speedometer at m
haytham navigates with his left hand
prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror
al ghazi in the passenger seat right hand rubbing another set of prayer beads down to nubs
the team in the back rows all staring at the prayer beads on the mirror
whispering to leavitt wouldnt need the power a prayer if there were hands on the wheel
miles per hour
how do you keep so calm
i mean really
is it breathing shhhh
if somebody was tailing us itd be obvious
this is just standard operating speed
al ghazi on the edge of his seat no belt scanning for threats sidewalks traffic rooftops
his left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an mp machine gun
fleury takes in a deep breath lets see who this guy is
colonel have you ever been to the i have been there only once
i spent four days at quantico
i saw your michael jordan play for the washington wizards
you dont know what you missed
you should have seen him play for our chicago bulls
fleury nods to sykes giving him the go to start in with the bad cop
throughout the following exchange we stay tight on fleury in control using sykes to ask the questions he diplomatically does not want to ask
you have portable lights on scene
loses his smile yes
but your team cannot work nights
janet looks to leavitt then fleury what did he say
fleury looks to sykes keep going
we only have seven days we work around the clock
and you are not safe at night
were safe during the day
fleury is about to step in when in arabic shocking a truck yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt u turn
over the median
heading back our way
something big in the trucks bed
our vehicle shimmies as al ghazi flinches drops his prayer beads
mp up to the colonels sight line muzzle tracking the truck
leavitt leans away from his window as the vehicles pass streetlights show two farmers a camel sitting in the bed
missed their left turn
a long nearly comical moment
smartass i dont like camels
fleury cycling through different angles
continues colonel do you believe abu hamza was responsible for this attack
we dont know
were saudi police involved in the attack
we dont know that either
any word on what that third big blast was
al ghazi getting tired of the questions exhausted himself
you interviewed witnesses
short fuse burning were trying
no one who was close enough to see the things we would like to know lived
were any of the uniformed bombers brother officers
do you know yet
team feeling the tension
fleury steps in and takes charge
you dont know the source of the blast dont know if your own officers were involved but you wont let us work nights
al ghazi stanches an explosion
haytham looks over at his colonel rarely ever seen him like this
looks in the rear view mirror to see sykes the man giving the colonel fits
sykes catches him looking back gives him a quick wink into the mirror
tight on haythams face the guilty little smile you give when someone takes your boss to task
of my brother officers were blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect
officers total across the country at four uniforms apiece
thousands of people who can sew forgeries
apologies that i dont have definitive answers
beat youre still not working nights
fleury stays quiet studying calculating thinking we got a handler thats going to be tough to handle
director grace already sits in front of youngs desk
good afternoon sir
young says nothing just pulls a memo from his bag clears his throat still no eye contact reads aloud like a poor mans orson welles sunlight is indeed the most
in that spirit i come before this judiciary committee with a painful admission
beat simply ive lost all confidence in the fbi especially its uppermost echelon
entrenched and outmoded the leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering thought this committee and i have tried to imbue
it is thus an agency at contretemps hindering our every effort
and by committee i mean the fucking senate select committee young finally makes eye contact expecting something like fear remorse back pedalling
then id change outmoded to outdated echelons to ranks and what in gods name is contretemps
these guys arent the best and brightest youngs face flashes red seething never take the lords name in vain in this office but you can say fucking
young apoplectic now ready to end the director right there when grace leans in lets the vague threat of physical contact manifest
youre going to the senate select committee but not to the president who appointed you
beat i bet the president wasnt the audience you thought hed be ill bet he realized you cant have voters asking why the second longest serving fbi director gets fired
for doing his job for sending agents into saudi arabia seven months from mid term elections you really want to bet
grace snaps his id badge off his lapel puts it on the table
youngs pallor tells us his bluff has been called
grace smells it finishes him now westmoreland made all us officers write our own obituaries during tet when it looked like the cong were going to end it all right
once we clued in that life was finite the loss of it no longer scared us the end comes no matter what its just a question of how you want
to go out on your feet or on your knees
after that we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted
and vietnam lasted another seven years
beat the lesson extends to this career i act knowing the end of this job will come no matter what
you should do the same
grace waits nothing else from young
stands snaps his id badge back on his lapel walks out
ill forward fleurys reports
the convoy brakes impossibly close to a checkpoint
waved through perimeters staffed by sang and police
fatigues automatic rifles peering at the tinted windows
crew arrives at a crime scene that spans the immediate horizon
white tents with sang sitting under each
industrial lights outline shattered buildings idle heavy equipment bombed out automobiles
tight on mayes looking out
thats one of the great horrors of television crime scene manipulation
they say a tv camera adds pounds to actresses
isnt that what they say
that is what they say
doesnt add to crime scenes
television cameras shrink them
tv always makes them look smaller
you cant feel the hatred on television
tight on fleury quiet and focused taking everything in
heads on a swivel people
two more security perimeters of sang surround the community center blinding portable lights heavy machine guns mounted in the backs of humvees track the convoy as it comes to a
stop every troop on guard
the team tentatively exits pairs of glares from heavily armed sang
soldiers descend on the teams bags paletts of equipment
long leers at janet not so much sexual as wary
janet goes for her own bag
haytham goes for it at the same time
their hands accidently touch
haytham pulls back fast embarrassed
janet notices the nasty marks around haythams right ear
florescent lights make it ugly
haytham dumps duffel bags by their bunks sang stack steel travel boxes from the paletts inside
no windows ac cranked to coldest
americans sealed in in the name of comfort
janets area made obvious with a floral partition
she immediately folds it puts it into a corner
haytham watches her undo his work
the bathrooms are through that door
i will be here tomorrow morning so we can begin
what time tomorrow morning
what time is sunrise
beat when i knock
al ghazi and haytham leave
the doors close behind them then the sound of a key turning in a lock
the americans look on half disbelief half comedy locking us in
thats against fire code
they dont have fire codes
they dont have codes other than codes of war
theyll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to
you know that sykes
dig a big hole and push us in
fill it up and no one comes calling
youre in the jungle now baby
silence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage
smiling you alright girl
watch it boy
everyone hits their own bags first
to himself saudi slow roll
fleury pulls out his laptop wakes it up from sleep mode
eyes a photo of kevin on his desktop picks up the phone
on phone hello
how are you
hows my boy
were just fine
how are you
where are you
quick beat lemme talk to my boy
a beat as lyla passes the phone to kevin
what you doing
im talking to you
what are you doing right now daddy
im missing you
where are you
im in saudi arabia
did you see big fran
i saw him
i saw him
is he still tall
hes still tall
as fleury takes a beat to collect himself
are you still there
i love you
keep your eye on your mama
be the man
you too daddy
ill call you tomorrow
i love you
fleury begins unpacking
pre dawn eight black suburbans parked on the side street waiting
the doors of the first four open in unison
arab suited security guards exit
al ghazi unlocks the door to the compound the team stands dressed waiting
close up the team steps out to see massive organized security
from one of the vehicles exits a middle aged american sweating a bit hanging back watching
this is us deputy chief of mission the embassys second in command damon another security contractors remain vigilant snipers on roof tops in machine gun nests
schmidt approaches fleury
big smile you are in so much trouble
is that right
i mean i dont know how you did it
nice work but if you live through this which i put at about fifty percent if you do your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on
fleury stares at this freak show
schmidt sticks out a paw
im in charge of getting you out of here
prince bin khaled and his inner circle exit a suburban and approach all in traditional dress
the prince locks eyes with fleury
in the bg forklifts rumble hiss to life placing jersey barriers around the community center
dont let go of his hand first
one of the inner circle without a word takes off the fbi emblazoned windbreaker worn by leavitt and places it on a short sleeved janet
careful not to touch skin
only then does prince bin khaled approach
a lone photographer follows snapping pictures
different definitions of personal space four inches separation as bin khaled greets each team member in accented english
janet last the pictures suddenly stop
the prince gives a little curtsy no words steps back to fleury the pictures re start
bin khaled holds fleurys hand sixth grade boyfriend style
in arabic this is our level of commitment to bringing terrorists to justice motions to the americans
no more unflattering a portrait pre coffee post twelve hour flight hours unpacking
as the cameras start flashing
angle on al ghazi and haytham placed to stand next to the americans
haytham clearly not comfortable with this kind of attention
weve invited american legal officials into our kingdom despite current difficulties between the us and islam
they will observe our advanced investigative techniques offering helpful hints
to fleury in english you will please honor me with your presence tonight at my home
beat a stunted nod yes
the prince turns back to the convoy
entire entourage follows
one of the security contractors catches the jacket janet hurls back at him tosses it to leavitt
the team turns glares again
fleury blinks out the camera flashes takes in all the eyeballs
fleury looks up at a retreating damon schmidt
you guys ready to go home now
dead eyes from fleury
hes clearly not amused
if you change your minds i got a plane fueled up and ready to go got your name all over it
he points a finger gun at fleury
strap your kevlar on tight people
schmidt takes off
sykes by fleury
gonna be like when you go deep sea fishing in florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat and you sit in the ocean for hours and the
crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and enough
haytham walks off by himself shaking off the shady royal photo vibe looking back at the americans
from behind him youre willing to die to protect your enemy
an older police officer stands with a group of sang twenty feet behind him eyeing haytham
back to fleury he looks to al ghazi
what did the prince say
beat that there are more rules than just not working at night
you are here as observers
fleury tries to remain cool
thats not accurate al ghazi ignores fleury
i need to make sure the sites are secure
then you can begin observing
leavitt looks around at the security as al ghazi hustles off to fleury how could they get more secure
the team slowly realizes theyre not going anywhere yet dump their bags in a pile already disgusted
in the distance the group of sang stare back at our team
hold on an empty x x balsa wood box set on a dirty linoleum floor
ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty gray plastic explosive
we immediately notice the right hand is missing the index and middle fingers
the hands insert bright red blasting caps into the explosives lengths of detonating wire emanating from each cap
another set of stronger younger in tact hands gently pours a mixture into the box now
ball bearings childrens jacks marbles razor blades roofing nails
everything malevolent densities and angles
some pieces bounce out run along the floor
the younger hands then start pressing molding the pieces of soon to be shrapnel into the putty gray plastic explosives
al ghazi and general malik stand outside
the athan sounds for dhuhr
soldiers immediately drop to their knees
tight on fleury focused thinking
sykes next to him
the athan sounds again for dhuhr
well this is going well
saudi slow roll
sykes and fleury lean against the locked door staring at the pathetic sight before them janets truly awful jumper
that somehow swishes every time
before she lands cocky and smooth good
then the metallic swish of the all weather net
leavitt boxes out air for the non existent rebound grabs the ball chest passes it great santini hard back to janet who softly sucks in the pass
playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots
how do you do that
janet gently bounce passes it back check
dont say good again
janet takes the check from leavitt before he can react she drains a footer
same cockiness different word bueno
fleury with sykes still standing in the same spot
looks up al ghazi coming into the building
fleury ready to vent until something surprises him breathless al ghazi has broken a wide sweat hustling back to the americans
fleurys face relaxes
he pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler hands it to al ghazi
i am sorry for the time
beat you wont need you gear
fleury cant help a small smile
to sykes himself of course we wont
hands in pockets
soak in the aftermath shallow but wide crater shredded backstop nearby buildings torn blood baked into dirt
the remaining rules you cannot touch evidence question anyone without me present touch muslim dead or leave my sight at anytime your safety is my primary concern
i would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime
and you would be mistaken
sykes looks over to fleury
to fleury i think its one of those something happens to us
his head comes off kind of deals
to al ghazi is it one of those kind of deals colonel
al ghazi ignores sykes
so if youre not running the investigation
al ghazi motions to men in uniforms different than his sang troops digging bagging evidence marking the scene with red flags
the national guards military police brigade is conducting the investigation
my orders begin and end with your health
the team so were on tour
fleury still silent
i thought the sang were soldiers the bombers didnt wear a soldiers uniform
they wore mine
fleury finally speaks asking the most important question who is in charge of the investigation then
al ghazi points to a man weve seen before general abdul malik
he pours over a table feet away maps blueprints utility schematics spread before him
general abdul malik
hes given us permission to walk through each crime scene
to walk through
are you kidding me
i am not
starting to get heated
get him over here now and lets clarify this situation
there is no lack of clarification
there sure as hell is
i dont know what kind of game youre playing but you got the wrong guy colonel al ghazi
that was not the deal getting hot this is not a game show mr
there are no deals made here
there is me telling you what you may or may not do and there is you doing it
as al ghazi stabilizes
you will be permitted to walk through the crime scenes
when we have determined that it is safe
a stand off
fleury eyes al ghazi
trying to figure this guy out
sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in al ghazis eyes unable to perform his profession relegated to tour guide
leavitt begins taking notes
haytham sees his notebook snaps his fingers at al ghazi who looks nods let him
fleury tight grins
in one of the apartments he sees a person looking down at them from behind a curtain
he tries a new tactic
how have you guys been doing with the witnesses
al ghazi just stares at fleury
im guessing there are a bunch of americans brits
someone must have seen something
im sure theyre just dying to talk to you guys seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms
that must be a real confidence booster for them
al ghazi silent staring
let me talk to them
al ghazi looks unsure
he was not expecting this
fleury and al ghazi walk up the front walk
fleury noticing kids bikes hockey gear a comfortable easy chair covered in fur outside on the front porch toy guns
fleury sits with the ripons earl s janine his wife s and maddy earls mother late s
earl sits on an ugly couch a plywood sheet right above their heads
everyone uneasy save the cat in maddys lap
fleury waves off a bottle of water from janine
al ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front door
theres still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound
why saudi arabia
a moment as earl and janine get a bit defensive neither of us did anymore schooling than electra high electra texas
al ghazi sees janine smile squeeze earls hand tighter
and the jobs here pay twice what youd make in midland or the gulf a mexico
plus the house is free
earls mother maddy looks at fleury pets the cat
i call it combat pay
this place has gone guns guns guns
so has everyone else now
my girlfriends in texas spend their combat pay on diamonds
i spent mine on a safe room
chuckles two nights back
can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong
we didnt really see anything
just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room
closed our eyes and prayed
it was so fast
so you really didnt see anything
i hit the deck
not til after
just the screams the kids
they were screaming
that got me out of the house
which kids were those
the jackson kids
tracy jackson next door was murdered looking out her window
front of her children
no safe room over there
right at al ghazi not even the men that did this should die in front a their babies
fleury lets moments pass
earl rubs his wifes leg trying to comfort her
al ghazi hides emotion
she live with her husband
beat if im facing your house is the jackson home to the right or left
fleury looks out the window towards the jackson house
next door to the ripons
door opens a sad man with black bags under dying eyes
disgusted resigned breath through a half open mouth
silver watch and polo insignia
sees al ghazi eyes come alive teeth grit
re al ghazi get him away from me easy sir
hes a friend to us i dont know either one a you
im special agent ronald fleury of the fbi
this is colonel al ghazi with the saudi state police the police they attacked
al ghazi quietly backs away walks away
fleury looks after him turns back to mr
jackson who stares after al ghazi hate
fleury unsure what to do next
i just put my boys down for the first time in two days
i cant wake em and sure as hell cant be gone if they stir on their own
can i come back
too loud your boys
jackson remembers the warning he just spoke
to ask about two nights ago
fresh tears re animate his face when my wifes jaw was shot off in front of our sons
my sons who sat with her while she bled to death
couldnt speak because she didnt have the bottom of her face and i wasnt home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year old had a
box of band aids in his hand when i finally got home
silence outside of mr
fleury sick to his stomach
desperate to let this man alone
no eye contact
i wont pretend to know
aaron jackson settles wipes away tears appreciates the honesty
then bites back into his rage kill everyone that had something to do with this
everyone related to them
everyone who knew them
beat and all youd be doing is their recruiting for them
its an entire generation not small and isolated like they say
but a generation that thinks what they did to my wife to my children is a calling
up the street there was a wreck did you see any notice how it wouldnt take a lot to disguise your friend points to al ghazi as a mexican
think he couldnt handle crossing our deserts
aaron explodes a childs scream from inside
jackson goes red clenched fists steps to fleury who takes an instinctive step backward guard up
jackson stops spins back inside
a door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window
the screams become night terror shrieks
a long sad beat as fleury and al ghazi stand alone in front of the jackson house
to al ghazi can we tour the compound
can we please do that
slow nod from al ghazi
the team tours the site
as they fan out
they walk casually but focused through the first bomb site
an inquisitive mayes already peering into a mostly in tact car halfway out of its parking spot
al ghazi and haytham watch the americans like mother hens
he or she almost made it
fleury steps looks inside blood and safety glass coat the seat
janet points to keys in the ignition still at the on position
then the stick shift pulled to the back right reverse
the shift knob bloody
beat quieter makes me think of the trade centers the people on the floors above the impacts no matter how fast or strong or smart you are if youre in
the wrong spot it will not let you get away
thats what makes this a war
sykes notices something on the ground
he picks up a military detonator discretely hands it over to fleury
fleury quietly pockets it
structures feet away look like theyve been hit with a god sized sawed off
the crater feet wide feet deep
blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater
the bottom of the crater filled with water
a syphon pump works overtime
no sang investigators around
about one hour into the rescue
hit a water main
no from the tanks of this fire engine thats the water that didnt evaporate in the blast
al ghazi points to a mass of black metal looks like a fire truck the way a jackson pollock looks like the mona lisa
leavitt and grant stand back
quiet eyes on fleury hole is the case
see theres evidence down in that hole
you understand evidence
little things that are clues
clues can be very helpful to a fella when hes trying to solve a crime
i understand that
glad to hear it
so can we get in there
sykes holds al ghazis gaze
fleury is taking in the entire crime scene
he notices a four story building half a mile off the perimeter
he watches al ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into the mud bag it himself search for someone to give it too
sets it down
stands wipes his hands hard on his pants
fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional trying to feel like hes doing something
the land cruiser haytham rammed drivers side crushed bullet holes out of control skid marks asphalt scars from the snapped drive shaft
fleury is moving around the scene restaging the shoot out
instantly lining up the angles
leavitts taking digital snaps of the shattered land cruiser
through the viewfinder the caved in door
a sang passes adam his gun aimed a touch high
to fleury a little high
to sang lower in arabic watt tee
watt tee fuck alt watt tee hell
is his gun doing up so high
to fleury this vehicle was stolen
two drivers murdered
a team outside the blast radius
shooting at anything
beat sergeant haytham ended this part
to al ghazi are the shooters in custody dead
so sergeant haytham speaks english
were any of these shooters your men
fleurys thinking looking into the car
searching the horizon he spots a distant apartment building providing a view of the crime scene
they got into the compound
took control of this vehicle
im guessing they didnt politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride
fleury gets in the car checking out ballistic shreds in the back of the passenger seat headrest
no they didnt
there were two officers in the car
both were executed
i understand that
those men were your men they were
they were police
al ghazi offers the slightest of nods to fleury
where was this car when they hit it
a a ext
al rahmah main gate a a al ghazi leads our team to the main gate
sykes and fleury follow close
security is a combination of the police and military
leavitt and mayes lag behind a bit
leavitt makes eye contact with a young saudi behind the
good news is that if he shoots you hes gonna shoot you sitting on an american tank
with an american made bullet
so its kind of all in the family
how about we get into those american suburbans
with their american a c
al ghazi continues the tour as fleury once again notes the familiar apartment off in the distance
a car port
fleury and team moving around the area
fleury picks up some broken glass from the ground
the car was parked here
fleury studies the scene
they were attacked from the front
must have assumed the killers were fellow officers
have any of these men been identified
we will check certain neighborhoods
it is likely that the four men prayed at the same mosque
the same mosque is enough to identify them link them to a cell
if the mosque is in suweidi
suweidi is a known militant stonghold
al qaeda could recruit from storefronts
on fleury he looks back at the homes then up and around he locks on the observation building in the distance
can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings
seems reasonable that the planner had to observe and based on hamzas past history its consistent that he would want to video the attack
is that true
is that accurate
that is true
well in order to video in order to observe you need a view
fleury points to one particular building
that building sees all three crime scenes
al ghazi looks up to the building
back to fleury
beat its outside the walls cmon now
this is insane we got enough security to invade suweidi let alone that building no you dont
to al ghazi respectful could you ask
were already seeing the crime scenes individually why not all at once
any answer will take time
fleury speaks slowly and clearly now like hes cementing his words in his own head as he speaks them
you have to ask the general then the general would ask the prince
does it go higher or is that
is the prince the end of the chain
al ghazi hesitates cant help but be charmed
fleury clearly knows when to step on or lay off the gas
and highly effective al ghazi nods yes to the strange half question
well be at the community center
beat janet wanna play hoops
were in the big gym as our team sits and waits
leavitt taps on a laptop
janet shoots free throws by herself
this is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped shaqs free throw percentages
take a man
ship him off to riyadh
no phones constant threat of death no girls no hip hop
just free throws
shaq hed be shooting at least seventy percent
lakers would still be together
kobe and shaq lovers forever
leavitt calls to fleury
check this out
fleury moves over to leavitt
checks out the screen
just posted half hour ago
images on the computer arabic extremist website
video footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some of the machine gun killings
so self congratulatory
makes me sick
fleury studies the footage
backs it up plays it again and again
a set of stronger younger in tact hands gently pours a mixture into a box now
ball bearings childrens jacks marbles razor blades roofing nails everything malevolent densities and angles
some pieces bounce out run along the floor
the younger hands then start pressing molding the pieces of soon to be shrapnel into the putty
five car convoy moving quickly through the city
our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment
they exit the vehicles
our team stands surrounded by a man security detail rifle stocks to shoulders
double time it outside the walls now hostile territory
two man sniper teams out front
al ghazi ten steps ahead
a sang five car security crew pulls up tracking fleury and company
a stand off between the two police forces
the sang officer in charge steps to al ghazi
in arabic this is unacceptable
its cleared with general abdul malik
we have five minutes here
we were told they must remain in the vehicles
that is not true
they must stay in the toyotas report me then when you get in touch with the general officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers al ghazi open handed as al
ghazi tries to step past
in that breath haytham punishes the officer with a left cross knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him
haythams kick follows catches the officer in the sternum as he hits ground
al ghazi shakes it out trades blows with the sang second in command
leavitt moves catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two steps
fleury aims drills the soldier that butted leavitt instant night night
another sang steps up
fleury throats him knee caps him and grabs his weapon before the dude hits the ground
fleury can obviously fight
all the above happens in four seconds
then a knock it off gunshot aimed at the sky pops one foot from janets head
we hear what she hears one half second of the shot then the big ring
on her knees immediately hand over her ear
in response heavy caliber gunfire flies group flinch n crouch
the warning shots from a
caliber mounted on a humvee racing this way from al rahmah dust plumes from the speed
members of the security detail and the special forces go mexican stand off
tell me it didnt burst tell me it didnt burst al ghazi the first to her touching her hand to pull it away from the ear
a sang nearby sees this spits two inches from al ghazi
al ghazi leans to janets non ringing side no blood
the humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas
general abdul malik out of the passenger seat in arabic that soldiers hand goes up sheepish
two men out of the humvees backseat break him down face first in the dirt cuff him lock him in the vehicle
standing doubled over a disagreement
the general grabs the officer by the back of his head an abusive dad
walks him to the side
back to al ghazi al ghazi looks back down at janet at leavitts bruise at the man fleury knocked out
impressed fought alongside him
haytham hasnt moved an inch not even when the general came chin raised to an entire platoon say when
to fleury five minutes
the sang move back
the team staggered slowly remembering why theyre here in the first place finally make their way to the roof top
fleury finds a table with a view
tabletop holes and finger paint stains
al ghazi three feet away
both look in the same direction two tigers being held back
fleurys studying the housing compound through a video camera comparing the images on his camera with what he saw posted on the internet
youve seen the images of the attack posted on the internet
look for yourself
al ghazi takes the camera from fleury
he lines up the same shots we saw posted on leavitts computer clearly a match
this is where they shot the video he was here
another long moment
al ghazi looks at the table discarded trash the capri sun containers the candy wrappers
formed the plan up here saw everything he could hit
beat way too pretty a plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit
he came here a couple times
al ghazi quiet for a long while
then he reciprocates the man who did this is a saudi this place this neighborhood
if foreigners were up here someone would say something
fleury looks over to the two dozen locals peering out with suspicion at them on the rooftop
here many people love hamza they think of him like bin laden
like your robin hood
fleury smiles small at whatever just passed between them
al ghazi stays stoic then looks straight at fleury a man who thinks of something like this
while maybe his family played around him
scares me more than i have words to express
refocusing two big answers in two small minutes
imagine if we had a couple days together
al ghazi pauses
im sure the general is good guy
and im just as sure hes no investigator
al ghazi stands still silent
fleury reaches into his pocket
reveals the detonator to al ghazi
al ghazi reaches to take it
fleury holds it for a beat
let me help you
he hands the detonator to al ghazi
al ghazi now pockets it
we break now too hot to work outdoors
then we will leave for the palace
and i imagine that will run until sundown
beat i had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime
fleury just nods back
miss mayes will not attend this evening
fleury looks over to janet
hurt yet extremely defiant she looks ready to attack anything that comes near her
you want to tell her that
cobra gunships covering the convoy as it blurs past police checkpoint after police checkpoint
intersections shut down
bracketed front and back by saudi humvees
al ghazi in the passenger seat hand on the stock of his mp again searching for threats
our team in back freshly scrubbed collared polos as formal as anyone thought to pack
team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance
the convoy zipping alongside a wall now desert orange in color twelve feet high blue ottoman tiles running the length of the walls horizontal center line
the helicopters peel off at steep angles the sound of the rotors reverberating in your chest
leavitt watching them go big wall
its a big palace
majlis a saudi political ceremony in which saudi citizens and local politicians most aristocratic and exclusive are permitted a brief audience with the prince
a bizarre receiving line of sorts
our team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the ceremony
how many princes are there
they all get palaces this big
some get bigger
who pays for all this
general motors ford chevrolet
hey man i drive a hybrid
the prince will ask you about your flight the accommodations
if he offers you the chance to hold his raptors dont flinch its a compliment
to grant genuine worry whats a raptor
damon schmidt appears
the prince sits on a sea of pillows
there are several small flat screens playing business reports cnn and al jazeera
seen from behind the prince everyone but leavitt standing next to faces weve never seen
the table holds six gold serving platters
enough food to kill a famine tended by a frenzy of servants
sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re fill
leavitt stands to the princes left thick leather glove on his hand a falcon perched on it
leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like hes already made peace with losing the arm
servants hold three others close by
his talons slice bone
thats my most prolific hunter
im trying to teach his friends there by example but i fear its something youre born with or not
do you agree mr
innate or not at all
nodding i could tell what have you seen so far of our kingdom
and know i can arrange tours anywhere within our borders
when i bull rush our hosts youll know it in his quiet calm amidst the bullets tone ive seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your kingdoms
history is without a doubt saudi
pin drop silence in response to fleury murdering the princes lite subjects his attempt to extend the gilded circle jerk by offering tours
bin khaleds face sinks to gray again after the excited pink of talking about his falcons
his hand slowly moves back over his stomach napoleons ulcers
as fleury speaks people unconsciously put their tea cups down look up at him with wide eyes
and that if you walk kilometers from the compound you will find a rooftop where the attacks were planned
ive seen that the person in this room born with it is right there
points at a gawking al ghazi everything i just said came from colonel al ghazi his observations of the scene while he was protecting us
and i think youre absolutely right sir that kind of instinct cant be taught not to falcons
definitely not to sang generals
innate or not at all
beat you want the murder to stop as much as i do
let us help
the prince stares at fleury cataloguing everything fleury just said
in arabic colonel al ghazi a word
as the prince walks out with al ghazi he signals another corps of servants to serve another round of cups coffee
a servant takes the falcon from leavitt just as he was starting to smile at it
fleury sips his coffee
schmidt and sykes approach
that was impressive
think it will work
i mean you can only play the im going to the press card like three more times
theyre paranoid and overly self protective
they arent protecting anyone
theres no conspiracy
theyre just terrified
the saudis have finally seen the monsters they helped create because those monsters have come home
and if saudis dont catch saudi monsters thats the end
fleury opens his mouth to interrupt
right through fleurys attempt to speak and that end could come double quick if they let the us shaytan catch those monsters for them
fleury silent gets it because thats what the saudi on the street suspects the only thing keeping the royal family upright is american evil
thats dead on accurate
thats why theyre making it hard on us and thats why he wants to help em turn the screws
they can have every shred of credit you see the slums on the way in
see that even though their homes are falling down they had satellite dishes bolted on
everyone already knows youre here
if the saudis cracked this cell while these servants were pouring coffee al jazeera still leads the story with your team
have you been to the crime scene
no if you had youd see the evil work of real talent
the kind that doesnt stop until its forced
and the path to hell is paved with good intentions
you having fun
genuine smile beats hell outta visa stamping
smile vanishing youre on an island
i hope you know how to get off
by catching abu hamza
raising his coffee toasting fleurys cup then heres to you
lets bet when this colonel al ghazi comes out hes in charge of the investigation if so you set me up on a date with janet mayes
semi grins from the team how the fuck did he do that
al ghazi on a cell rattling orders in excited arabic every investigator on scene by midnight more portable lights three more pumps to leavitt do me a favor and tell
janet that she and damon schmidt got a date when he gets back to the states
al ghazi points into darkness
the rules still stand
beat but tomorrow will be a new day
tight on blasting caps military detonators nails wing nuts bolts jacks marbles
young hands feed lengths of detonating wire through pre drilled holes on a wooden cover
the cover is attached to the box with nails and a rubber mallet no sparks
the wires are braided into one clipped to a lead on a servo motor attached to the box top
a vehicle is being fitted with tire guards and heavy duty crash bumpers all as a man quietly talks
widen to reveal the man being videotaped foretelling of new threats face obscured by his head wrap
several other men watch and listen
tight on the mans eyes
reveal photos on a nearby table the al rahmah compound fleury with al ghazi leavitt and mayes sykes and haytham
half assed gardening party
al ghazi worked through the night hasnt slept since we last saw him
looks like it
from now on any evidence you find you hand over
al ghazi smiles
im all ears special agent fleury
we should start with the dead shooters
they had no identification on them
fingerprints and dental have come up empty
can we photograph all three of them
couple hundred copies each
if its ok with you id like to suggest we split up as follows
sykes and leavitt cant help small smiles
finally getting to work
blast site morning a sykes climbs down into the mud hole
from the crater fellas what we want to do is get this water out of here
see whats really going on
no reaction from saudi police c vin hunting data plates something drivable blew up
thats pretty obvious
feels like anfo to me boys ammonium nitrate fuel oil
lets dry this hole and see if we cant figure what she was
grant at the crater
three brand new industrial sized pumps draining it
police investigators watch sykes
to the saudis got to get a little dirty people
crawl up in it
make deep contact
you get that
dead confused stares from the saudis into the mud hole
sykes happy as a pig in shit
get nasty dirty filthy
he smiles watches another officer write saudi translations on the stainless steel paint cans into which you load evidence shrapnel soil dna shells etc
a junior officer double times it to al ghazi with a stack of photos rough head shots of the three dead shooters
fleury takes some hands the rest back to al ghazi
have him pass these out to the compound security
see if anybody knows them
fleury leavitt and al ghazi walk past the land cruiser haytham took out
police investigators on scene leavitt stops drops his bag
al ghazi introduces him to the officer in charge
leavitt opens his evidence kit
a couple of police cant help but sneak a peek checking out what the americans got inside
fleury stands with al ghazi back in the ripon home
would you mind doing one more thing for me
fleury pulls out the photographs
could you tell me if you recognize any of these men
fleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room table not pretty pictures
earl and janine study the photos
a few moments then i dont know any of them
fleury thinks a minute
im just wondering
that chair out side
looks like it gets a lot of wear
that my moms chair
see thats exactly what i was thinking
im guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside
she must pretty much see it all
where is she
pause fleury slow nods then
lets wake her up
maddy up at the dinning room table looking down at the photos
ive seen him
like a week ago
twice ive seen him
with the garden crews
i remember he was wearing a liza minnelli t shirt
i thought that was funny
what about the others
closer examination no
i remember the t shirt
i remember thinking it was odd
what the liza minelli shirt
i do think liza minellis gone odd but that wasnt it
what was odd
he was a saudi
saudis like americans dont do manual labor
blowing leaves is beneath them
fleury looks to al ghazi for confirmation
al ghazi nods
to maddy thank you
fleury and al ghazi start to leave
who is he
fleury looks back to earl
thats one of the many things were trying to find out
al ghazi gives the photo of the identified shooter to an aide waiting outside
find out if he worked with the gardeners
the aide takes the photo starts walking away
freaked the aide about jumps out of his skin
sykes has a saudi work crew digging in the hole pulling out pieces of charred metal
he is slowly laying out the pieces and studying them like a puzzle trying to figure out what the hell blew up
janet and haytham approach a square foot m
tent attached to refrigeration units
sang officers look down at the americans dead eyed watching them work
the muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the sunna
western bodies lie separated from arabs
a saudi technician blankly hands janet and haytham lab coats to cut the cold
three police officers in the tent with them watching janet
haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to be seen with the american woman
fleury knocks at aaron jacksons door
a pause the peep hole darkens
a longer pause then the door opens
aaron jackson doesnt look any better
jackson is clearly getting out of dodge
beat how are your sons
jacksons eyes shrink wrapped in tears
after a long silence with no answer fleury hands him a sheet of paper thats the name of a clinical psychologist
works with embassy kids
apparently very good at explaining violence what do you know about what my kids need
what they saw
what the rest of their lives might be like
beat i thought maybe your boys
without their mom anymore
might ask you why sometime
aaron jackson begins shaking his head yes
tears flow free sorrow and gratitude
he hangs on to fleurys hand for a very long time
i will find the man responsible for the death of your wife
beat tomorrow itll be somebody elses wife
then tomorrow ill come back
fleury turns his head al ghazi approaches on the next lawn down with three junior officers
fleury nods goodbye to jackson
fleury approaches al ghazi holds up the shooters photo
we know who he is
hes on several watch lists
fleury a slight nod of satisfaction
we know where he lives
we will very soon
you dont seem very excited
these are always the easy ones to catch
rarely does it lead to the planners
beat i want to take you somewhere
to someone who may be able to help us catch hamza
ten police investigators in the crater with grant
outside the crater pieces of vehicles laid out outside of a door of a front axle bits of engine
five feet away from that stacks of bagged evidence two dozen evidence containers
sykes clambers out of the hole streaks of re animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline mad dashing for his chin
a chunk of metal in one hand something small in the other a marble
he drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal one half of an alternator
sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal
he studies a piece of twisted half melted iron
he walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal
starts trying to fit the two pieces
like a puzzle
the dead oblong faces of the dog walkers
janet uses forceps to pull a wing nut from one of the dog walkers
places it on a sanitary table littered with shrapnel tiny bits of colored glass ball bearings parts of razor blades spent slugs and scraps of unidentified metal
sykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron
until something clicks
sykes looks down at the connected metal
its a gurney
sykes looks down at the mud colored diggers
whos missing an ambulance
just stares from the saudis
could somebody please go get sergeant haytham
confused stares from the saudis
loud sergeant haytham
inside the crater water level down to the ankles
three saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie style back tires
re positioning to get a better grip sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable ragged hole still mostly submerged
sykes slogs over
he drops to his knees reaches his hand in all the way to his shoulder the side of his face to the water void
out of the crater sykes points to a bobcat earth mover in arabic who has the keys
janet stands with the saudi pathologist
she prepares to take a fingerprint from a body
as the moves in to touch the arab hand one of the guards unloads in her direction a full guttural arabic assault
no idea what hes saying but its obvious hes furious
haytham starts firing back
this is an un translated argument
we sense that the guard is doing more than expressing his displeasure regarding janet
this seems to be personal
janets getting very nervous
a frightening display
then haytham turns you cannot touch any muslims
janet takes a breath as the police hard eye her
can i still touch americans
janet moves back to the american dead as the saudi tech continues with the muslims
she pulls another shard of colored glass from a wound
a two car convoy drives deep into the city
the convoy is forced to stop across the street from a gas station as a construction crane backs into a drive way
al ghazi and fleury stare across the street as a large gas truck fills up the heavy tanks of a saudi gas station
whats gas running a gallon out here al ghazi
al ghazi smiles
it was an american
an engineer named karl twitchell
hired by saudi arabia to find water
he didnt find so much as a dried oasis but he found this
enough oil to turn the earth
fleury stares out as the oil spills out overflowing from the station tank
they say my country sits on over trillion more barrels of recoverable oil
a trillion reasons for our leaders to hold hands another one hundred years
a trillion reasons to keep fighting
for both sides of this war
beat i think our oil has begun destroying more than it creates
im years old
beat tired i have three daughters
and i find myself in a place where i no longer care about why we are attacked
i only care that people woke up a few mornings ago had no idea it was their last
when we catch the man who murdered these people i dont care to ask even one question
i just want to kill him
beat a bit embarrassed do you understand
yes i do
a long moment
just road noise
we see two men as different from each other as they could be yet made from the same things
is your first name colonel
a small smile faris
a glazed haytham works with a pathologist on the muslim bodies
their own collection of foreign objects
janet pulls free of a marble from a burrowed hole explains the shards of colored glass
cleans it in saline holds it up to the light
we stare at it with her
janet begins piecing together glass shards reconstructing a police investigators eat lunch under a tent yards away with leavitt
then a red laser sight moves across him three members of his police security detail smirking pretending to fidget with an ar s aperture
silent moments pass
the smallest of the detail reaches over pulls the cocking device of the rifle round in the chamber so stop looking at us
sykes covered in mud digging searching for any signs of identification amongst the charred mangled metal
the small convoy pulls up next to a run down late seventies chunk of architecture which looks like a combination bombed dentist office accounting firm
two teenagers in tu pac t shirts smoke in front
fleury al ghazi and a couple of police head for the blacked out front door
moving up two flights of stairs
dark rundown shredded carpet
old hip hop cheap bass thin speakers
everything grows in intensity as they move up the stairs
two more teenagers skulk past
half joking to al ghazi feel like im back home in detroit
al ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on fleurys top ten list of the most bizarre places hes ever been
two rooms first is some kind of snack smoke tv lounge
filipinos serve drinks
packs of young saudi men drink cokes tea coffee and smoke
odd saudi talk shows mix with hip hop
behind another room bigger overflowing with stacks of mis matched computers
dozens of them
dozens of saudi teenagers plugged in
head phoned and micd
all chain smoking all fully plugged in to call of duty an american war game on line
these kids play with rabid intensity smoking and screaming and killing
al ghazi moves through the crowd
a small middle aged saudi spots al ghazi
they exchange words
al ghazi waves fleury to follow
fleury does and follows al ghazi through the computer room into a back office
a middle aged saudi talal
he sits behind a cluttered desk
art books and computers everywhere
he gets up and embraces al ghazi
al ghazi then turns to face fleury
at one time talal was arafats senior bomb maker and planner in the occupied territories
he joined bin laden when al qaeda brought the fight to the royal family
shouldnt we arrest him or shoot him or something
small smile from al ghazi
he turned himself in last year during an amnesty
hes now part of a new government effort to balance the experience of saudi youth
this place is community service
if america figures out a way of keeping their kids off the computers please let us know
why did he turn himself in
before al ghazi can answer talal begins talking to him in arabic
al ghazi translates you only come after i see there were bombs
did you know bin laden put million dollars on my head
why shouldnt it be
then talal becomes quiet grave
al ghazi continues the translation the man who made war on al rahmah is someone my age this kind of skill is learned over decades
talal looks at fleury now speaking directly to him through al ghazi a man who can plan the mass murder of women and children then go home at night to
his own and sleep soundly
that kind of man is supremely difficult to catch
through al ghazi how does he know he slept soundly
colonel al ghazi hesitates then relays fleurys question
talal stares eyes touched by war blood atrocities committed
someone who believes hes going to hell
translating because he hasnt stopped
you stop when their faces dont let you close your eyes
through al ghazi is that why you quit
translating days without sleep will make you quit anything
two teenagers stick their heads into the office
theyre mad about the sharing of a computer
talal puts a fast stop to it
its obvious hes good with these young boys
he smiles as he speaks to al ghazi
al ghazi translates to fleury
he says he makes my job easier
here at least they only fight and kill on computers
al ghazi shows talal the detonator
the old man studies it
al ghazi and talal speak in arabic about the detonator
al ghazi looks to fleury translates
he says that there are several ways to get american military equipment like this detonator but not many men in saudi arabia that know how to get them
how do they get them
usually smuggled from iraq by corrupt soldiers working with the americans
could hamza get this equipment
al ghazi asks talal
yes he could
through al ghazi how do we find him
he thinks for a moment then speaks
the boys chuckle as al ghazi continues translating prayer
fleury looks at al ghazi doesnt quite get it
to al ghazi well i think i get the prayer and luck parts
talal slowly stands al ghazi helping him up moves to fleury
reaches his hand out to him quietly translating his hands will feel like this
fleury shakes talals hand turns it over index finger gone
translating every amir at some point gets bitten by his work
the bobcat digs into the crater over the unknown hole
already a large pile of dirt
another sizeable scoop down about two feet nothing
haytham now stands over the crater watching sykes
leavitt has joined him
whatever this is it blasted off like nasa
haytham yells to the machine operator in arabic driven in at an angle
another gouge of earth feet
grant sits back
high order explosion doesnt do it justice whats left a this looks like it was put through a wood chipper
leavitt rubs his eyes adrenaline long gone
looks at his watch time passing fast
sykes drops to his stomach reaches in with the trenching tool to see how much farther the hole goes a metallic clink
an oxygen tank
the kind used in ambulances
nozzle assembly gone burst in the explosion with a force that drove it several feet into solid ground
haytham takes a razor blade scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive residue into a fresh cannister
then takes a wet rag begins cleaning the tank to reveal arabic script
to sykes hospital identification
do you know this hospital
call it in
now a mini command post
al ghazi works phones with fleury and mayes by his side
sykes and leavitt muddy sitting on their cots
leavitt tags evidence from the shootout
al ghazi hangs up looks to fleury
the ambulance was reported stolen from king fahd hospital last wednesday three days before the bombing
theres more i told you it wouldnt be hard to find the soldiers
focused to al ghazi what you got
the stolen ambulance had a twenty man crew that rotated shifts on it
we checked all twenty men
one of them muaath hazmi is now of interest to us
al ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter attacker
because this gentleman is fathi hazmi muaaths brother
im going to show you
a five block radius has been sealed off by police vehicles
fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter crouched behind barricades at the entrance of a cul de sac
theyre not allowed anywhere near the line of fire
they sport bullet proof vests and helmets look like reporters in a war zone
police turn away cars neighbors
snipers stand posted on near by rooftops
helicopters audible overhead
we never get to do anything fun
sykes im guessing you dont even remember how to load your gun
thats not funny
shes not trying to be funny
im a very good shot
haytham hands al ghazi a walkie talkie in arabic neighbors clear
activity or communication
snipers have seen nothing
no telephone line into the house
two black suburbans roll around the corner out fitted with running boards and hand rails upon which a man swat team rides on each rail vehicles
swat team military fatigues black hoods mp close quarter sub machine guns
flying down the cul de sac half way down the street one of the snipers open fire boom boom boom
that moment an rpg fires wide of the lead suburban
over al ghazis walkie talkie in arabic the two swat teamers at the front of the running boards open up with their mp s one handed the front of the
house puffs bursts disintegrates
suburbans rip to a stop
swat off move fast
three toss flash grenades into and around the house
massive flash bangs
six through the front door
six sprinting around back
loud ak bursts from inside now
then an rpg fired inside the rushing sound and yellow white flash past two windows
a section of the far left wall of the house detonates from the inside out
more mechanical silenced thwacks from the swat mp s
then voices from al ghazis walkie talkie
ambulances round the corner fly toward the house the team enters wide eyed
four men in civilian garb all dead multiple bullet wounds
an officer with four x mug shots matching them to the dead faces dropping mug shots on respective chests
once hes finished a police photographer takes new pictures of each
at the far side of the house engineers use x s to support the wall hit with the rpg
all of it has the feel of standard saudi operation procedure
al ghazi appears from the back of the house
bends over each of the four dead men lifting each of their hands examining the backs of the hands quickly
prints are on the other side
im not looking for prints
im looking for fingers
stands after the last a look of controlled frustration that fleury files
then al ghazi motions to sykes and fleury
back to the rear of the house stacks of plastic explosives buckets of shrapnel two paramedics working feverishly on a swat officer hit multiple times
fleury goes about his business like a man isnt dying six feet away
sykes is a kid in a candy store rummaging through explosives blasting caps shrapnel
janet makes her way back
immediately moves to the wounded swat officer
this shrapnel look like the stuff you pulled at the morgue
i pulled so much its hard to remember it all
al ghazi begins tossing the room motions to fleury help
fleury moves to him
calling back al ghazi dumps desk drawers pictures of government looking buildings walled compounds
lays them out in rows studying each
leavitt appears focuses on the c immediately
the front gates of every other western housing compound in riyadh
everybody looks at the colonel pointing at the pictures and embassies italy japan korea norway england

leavitt steps scans the pictures picks up two in particular buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment
these are all countries with troops in iraq japanese and italian embassies are under construction
the entire diplomatic quarter is being retro fitted to sustain bigger bomb blasts
janet pops her head in the princes convoy just showed

damon schmidt trailing behind the princes detail
the prince locks al ghazi with a mad dog stare in between lesson points
one of the princes inner circle heads straight for al ghazi in arabic take the americans inside now and keep them out of sight
you will be spoken to about their presence here
the team sitting on the floor below the window sills away from the holes and doors
al ghazi standing looking out the window at the spectacle
damon schmidt steps in sees dead bodies and goes ghost almost collapses
leavitt pops up helps him sit
you need water
a quick no nod like the second before you lose lunch

the phone rings that instant
leavitt hands it up to fleury
schmidt holds his hand up to janet high five she gives it up slowly warily semi charmed to janet double or nothing thats a congratulatory call

flying down a highway
sykes up front
the rest of the team crammed in back fleury next to al ghazi mayes and leavitt on the back bench
grant stares up at a distant jet climbing out
the police radio belching calm codes and calls every few seconds
to al gahzi what do you think
al ghazi looks up at fleury slowly shakes his head
its a small win
im thinking about new york february
the first time they tried to hit the trade towers
im thinking about going straight to dans gonna order six pbrs pabst

small smile no
thats just unreasonable
good police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing which enables the other
in the back al ghazi cant help a small smile either
fleurys not into it
all business pissed clearly does not want pabst
to al ghazi remember how we caught that cell
he went back to pick up his deposit on the rental car
four hundred dollars
for four hundred dollars he was caught
catching the cell was easy
just like this
the cell came back
fleury looks at al ghazi
he knows the win is small
also knows thats all she wrote for now
ill be back
yes you will
the police band suddenly squelches loud with excited arabic
everyone perks leans up to listen to the urgency
translating radio chatter religious demonstration in progress
back near the city center
a small collective smirk sigh of relief
fleury turns in his seat
beer will open up your subconscious
canned beer especially
give you instincts they cant teach fleury notices the suburban bringing up the rear has dropped back
looking back is he responding to the call
al ghazi and fleury both looking back to the following suburban now
dropped back sunglasses and blank faces staring back at them
fleury looks to the overpass above he sees a young man on a cell phone
as they pass the kid runs to watch them from the other side
al ghazi gets to the cb radio in arabic tighten up the trailing suburban doesnt tighten up
it falls further back
fleury instinctively turns wide eyed out the window a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes flying across the desert median aimed at the convoy
without hesitation fleury reaches over haytham rips the steering wheel right nosing away from the approach
our suburban on two wheels the lead suburban turns the same direction a twitch too late
the small brown truck detonates
the lead suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion broadside essentially shielding our vehicle
flame spits through the lead vehicle as it spins flips onto its roof
off road now violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber
the lead suburban tortoise on its back engulfed still sliding
fleurys suburban fish tailing
the lead suburban blows in half now as the gas tank ruptures
a football sized shard of metal explodes through our windshield and smashes straight out the back taking the rear cargo door with it
the shock of it causes haytham to lose control in earnest now
the suburban flips barrel rolls
violent pounding inside the vehicle
motion stops upside down just the roar of the big detroit v red lining wheels spinning in air
everyone dazed border line unconscious
fleurys bell rung the worst trying to function get his bearings
fleury touches leavitts face can barely see through the gathering smoke that smells like oil
think so leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into the ceiling running footfalls approach quick yell yips in arabic commands
the driver and three other police officers from the trailing suburban
smoke fills the interior now thank god these police officers have ripped open a door saviors
they grip leavitt by his hair because its the only thing they can grab
alarmed al ghazi begins to scramble for leavitt
this is not right
haytham gets a good look at the driver recognizes him as the officer who shamed him at the compound on day one
haytham moves to unbuckle
fleurys trying to claw towards leavitt
throwing upside down punches at the air
unbuckles himself now
panicked alarm rising everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the ceiling as horizons go flip flop confusion
leavitts throwing punches as hes dragged with velocity to the trail suburban idling
pistol whipped viciously repeatedly until theyre able to kick him inside
another officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an ak pulls back the cocking mechanism ready to spray the dazed occupants of our suburban the officers ankles and shins
pop pop pop pop from the drivers seat haytham
screams from the would be shooter at double volume
haytham keeps firing as the officer hit multiple times falls hard
the trailing suburban hesitates slams into our suburban just as fleury is getting out of the wreckage
everybody else still inside knocked silly
the trailing suburban backs up quick
fleury instinctively goes for his holster empty for days now
trailing suburban accelerates away now as janet struggles out
haythams mm in hand racked open empty
fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle in the passenger seat of the trail suburban he sees the officer that checked passports at prince sultan
fleury rips grants door open
trapped smoke billows clears grants arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at an unnatural angle bleeding badly
cant release fleury begins sawing grants seat belt with a jagged piece of metal
hands up youre gonna fall sykes still does ugly
fleury and janet rip him free of the suburban
haythams pulling shotguns handguns ammo from the flipped vehicle
haytham pointing ahead to the fading roster tail
in arabic theyre going to disappear
desperate fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing suburban the rooster tail it leaves getting smaller
al ghazi nods swings his head to thesnarled wrecked highway traffic
people hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct
haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the teams feet re loads his mm
janet ties a half assed tourniquet around sykes reminder of an arm
al ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd they see his state his gun and turn back panic starts to infect the larger mass then the topper automatic gunfire from somewhere
glass dirt metal bursts around us this attack is still going
fleury looks up just the roof of an old mercedes on the median dirt kicked up behind them running behind lines of stopped wrecked traffic now
the barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt
accelerating for another opening to finish the job
scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists
many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert the rest go smash em up derby folly panicked drivers aiming for the same spots
fleury snatches an m a from the stack dropped by haytham up to his shoulder hustling toward the next break in traffic
the mercedes is approaching at mph
back to his crew al ghazi starts screaming in arabic motioning frantically to the citizens who have turned back running toward them in arabic fleurys view blocked by fleeing saudis
just intermittent flashes of the mercedes braking hard massive dust cloud behind them sliding toward the opening fleury pre sighted
intermittent wild shots fired from the suv vaguely in our direction
fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle just forward of the handle full auto
takes a deep measured snipers breath eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip perfectly one heartbeat before the mercedes
hits the gap
the right side of the mercedes shreds just as it appears
fleurys clip gone in a flash yet more rounds still hit the mercedes al ghazi four feet away firing his own salvo from a knee
something bright red pops against the drivers side window now the mercedes rip slides to a stop
wild half aimed shots back at us
then it starts up again
al ghazi bolts toward the line of stopped traffic
searching for something big empty still running
fleury right on his heels
early s land rover
driver long gone exhaust plumes pumping out
al ghazi dives into the drivers seat fleury shotgun
guns it to the rest of the survivors an eye on the rooster tail of the mercedes he and fleury just shredded heading the same direction as leavitts kidnappers
al ghazi jumps out ushers haytham into the drivers seat
in arabic you know suweidi you know how to go fast
fleury helps sykes into the rear
janet loads the weapons
the land rover spits its own tell tale plume as it sprints away down the median dodging traffic in desperate pursuit
startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves elsewhere
petering screams shouts
hold on the flipped still burning still smoking suburbans
surreal in the sun smoke haze
driving as fast hard as possible
no regard for anyone thing
passport officer up front pulls a cell phone
a third and fourth in the back still beating and zip cuffing leavitt
janets sitting with sykes in the rear readying weapons and ammo
she hands him twin berettas sykes double fisting despite his wound looking forward to a fight
nobodys gonna hurt leavitt but me
drivers seat p
on the median mph dodging abandoned and escaping cars
high beams flashed on off on off constant horn gaining on the mercedes rooster tail ahead of them
powering deep into the suweidi neighborhood
skid stopping and backing into an alley between broken down three story buildings
haytham scanning as he drives straining to see the plume from the second attacking vehicle way ahead blending with other fleeing scared motorists
we watch as the distant plume cuts hard left at a high rate of speed
the year old son we met on the rooftop is on his cell phone again speed assembling an ancient vhs camera atop a tri pod
in arabic frantic intercut with the mercedes driver yelling frantic into his cell phone arabic hes been shot
back in the room a huge man dressed in paramilitary black face wrapped in his shumagh so only the eyes are visible stands in front of a sheet hung from
the ceiling quietly practicing reading a speech for an imaginary audience
lots of gesticulating and head movement
the handle of large knife sticks from his waste band
door bursts open bottom hinge rips from the jamb
leavitt is slammed to the ground
passport officer shoves the practicing speaker out of the way turns to the wide eyed year old
leavitts face already swollen black bleeding scanning the room with terrified fury in his eyes
he sees the handle of the knife sticking from the huge mans waistband
his tears leak all at once
the officer takes the knife turns to leavitt dirty inch blade
haytham searching for the turn off where the rooster tail they were following cut left died
at the last minute he sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit decaying apartment block neighborhood
haytham cuts hard fish tails
sykes head smashes into the rear side window starring it
theyre being lead into riyadhs most hostile neighborhood
we should not be here
janets pov scanning for the trail suburban and the mercedes she cant help but notice the neighborhood
halfway past an intersection fleury yells haytham brakes reverses the suburban
without hesitation haytham pulls across the cramped street surrounded by the same decaying buildings
ahead civilians huddled behind cars poking heads out from behind shacks
a second passes these people know where the attackers went
al ghazi locks eyes with a little boy
he quickly quietly just shakes his head no
in the back sykes has fallen on his back
he looks up through the window sees a shape jet past on the top of the closest building three stories up the little boy was nodding a warning what follows
is fast chaotic eyes closed combat big boom of close in shells
as haytham throws it in reverse and punches the front of the rover shreds
the windshield bursts
engine dies tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly
haytham and al ghazi tuck into the dash
fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible
janet covers sykes
a thump thump thump can be heard on the roof a grenade thrown with too much arm by the guy sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the land
frantic fleury swats it out
the blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle starring windows rocking it creak of shocks and struts
fleury lifts up now grabs the m returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops
that provides cover and reminds everyone in the car theyre armed
janet exits with a rifle firing out the back door more covering fire
civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that its a fight
a shooter black hood black t shirt old school red white black air jordans snub stock ak an open filthy north face backpack at his feet holding spare clips god
knows what else
shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge firing down in random sweeps head turned like hes lighting a fire cracker
we see things from above three stories down a sweep of blindly fired shells pop the asphalt inches from fleurys head soiling his face in black top debris
but fleury never stops firing back his own head slightly turned flinching on reflex
air jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates fleurys three feet away with the riot gun
another rack and blast to make sure a
stays down for eternity
fleury spots and bull charges a second shooter ballistic chicken fleury wins
fleury spins racking the riot gun aims and freezes six year old boys stare from the doorway
haytham crouches in front of the land cruiser
rocks thrown now from somewhere kids peeking from behind shacks palestinian style
hes pelted in the side of the head
janet and sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover
from the rooftop fleury yells down to the men on the ground
an apartment complex that looks like a roadside motel exposed stairwells walkways entrances
a puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor
then we look right one street over civilian figures some in traditional dress starting to mass
he drops the riot gun picks up the ak from the man he just killed pops a new clip from the backpack slings the backpack over her shoulders
starts to hustle down
gunshots reverberating from outside
the year old hands shaking with nerves screwing the camera into the tri pod set up almost complete
the passport officer is posted at the door head poking out weapon up and ready
we can hear arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway
passport officer barks something back
the driver of the trail suburban squats pinning leavitts head down with his knee knife near a long white expanse of neck
the huge man sits on leavitts stomach keeping him in place
leavitt trying to gasp for breath eyes wide panic
just as the year old nods yes leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort kicks just enough to nudge the camera trying to knock it over
the year old gets his hands on it as it falls almost catches it slips out smacks the ground battery pops off
the driver and huge man both begin hammering adam
in arabic year old picks the camera up again trying to re attach the battery as adam fights for his life
spit and claws and snot and blood rage
running down side stairs fleury spots a grenade launcher poking from a door next door to the apartment with blood pool in front
empties his clip into that vicinity windows shatter wood splinters
the grenade launcher recedes
janet and al ghazi start to run
the launcher fires from its new position
the trail suburban detonates
al ghazi and janet knocked flat on their asses for second and third times dazed
fleury searching i know that fuck with the rpg is reloading how do i kill him
drops the bag off his shoulders pulls a grenade out fires it as hard as he can yards on the fly
bounces just on the third floor landing rpg soldier just locking the new rocket tube in brings the reticle up to his eye
grenade blast splits through whats left of the front window
big flinch tense on his part rocket fires inside roars down the hall hits two feet in front of the door passport officer has been peaking out of
massive contained detonation
passport officer vanishes
the year old and his camera are blown through the driver waiting to saw leavitts neck
because leavitt was held so tight to the floor he escapes the worst of the blast
still fucked up
ears roar with the ring no sounds
year old and driver lay in a heap on the floor
huge mans on his back trying to get up
leavitt breathes rolls to the driver and the boy grabs drivers blade
hand to hand war as leavitt gets his payback
he does not stop
sykes takes cover between two cars holding down the rear firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak out the locals
he fires above the crowd as janet heads into the building
two little kids slowly approach carrying water obviously terrified at the sight of the wounded american
sirens and helicopters sound in the distance
base of the stairs mayes joins fleury and a dazed al ghazi haytham
a tunnel networks through all these places
they use attached civilian apartments innocent families
i do not like these people
we go in the front door
haytham cover the stairs
watch the side doors
watch your backs
bracing for war
they move levels up the stairs into the building following the blood trail from the suv to the apartment
people step out of their doors
al ghazi aiming at them in arabic the puddle of blood a trail leading under the door
the front wall window entrance of the next apartment down still smoldering from fleurys grenade
no sounds words
our team fingers on triggers weapons to shoulders sights aligned
ten feet back
shoulders already flexed with tension expecting a suicidal blast at any moment
janet grabs another grenade moves to secure the hallway
intercut sykes outside
haytham on the stairs
beat to al ghazi is allah on the other side of that door
al ghazi raises his prayer beads to fleury
beat i think were about to find out my friend
fleury moves forward im primary through the door
al ghazis right with him
fleury gets three point stance low hits the door like jim brown
fleury opens up in response
fleury never stops forward motion
stumbling headlong into a kitchenette hard into a refrigerator and cabinets firing the whole time
al ghazi blasting anything that looks like a body
straight mop up operation
securing the hallway mayes steps into a charred apartment through doors blown off hinges
she heads in deeper towards the bedroom
finds the closet it tunnels into the apartment below
she peers into the hole sees a bloody knife below thrown by an unseen hand
janet wide eyed horror about to pull back when she is yanked into the hole by her hair
huge man attacks janet
vicious hand to hand blows
still tied leavitt does what he can kicking at the attacker
adrenaline morphs janet from scared and out sized to desperate and equally vicious
this is saving private ryan shit with leavitt as the observer
hes no coward hes doing everything he can
huge man overtakes janet slow choking her
shes gasping dying
janet has a knife out and is shredding the big mans back right thigh and ass
from nowhere fleury ends the fight with a butt end baseball swing of the shot gun to huge mans head
janet fucked up but alive
to leavitt sykes is going to kick your ass
al ghazi follows fleury into the room
leaning to janet fleury sees leavitt puts his hand on his head
leavitts somewhere else tears in his eyes just taking deep measured breaths
slow nods from leavitt and janet as fleury cuts adams ties
theres at least three more of them
as janets eyes catch on something a sheet half assed backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down exposing a crude square cut out of the wall a
path into another apartment
janet points to the hole in the wall
this isnt over a seven year old girl peers out at her shaking tears in her eyes
janet tries her best motherly smile
its okay little one
the little girl backs away
janet gets up steers leavitt outside
sits him down
hands him a glock
fleury and al ghazi step through the hole
a blood trail snakes through little ones room out her door and deeper into another apartment
little girl long gone into the main part of the apartment
then arabic screams the metal crashing sound of automatic gunfire
sirens overheard outside now
hustle cautious into the apartment
haytham stands in the room already the muzzle of his ak still smoking held on a man down
the other occupants of the room are a cowering family kids and a couple of real old folks all terrified
a little boy cries by himself huddled in a corner
the collateral damage of random violence
janet quick scans the room
locks eyes on the traumatized little boy his innocence draining as she watches
cant take her eyes away
taking this all in the violence
the terror of this family the defiance on the faces of these young souls
al ghazi post game shakes a tear running down his cheeks spattered in blood stares at fleury
the man haytham shot is not dead ragged gasps
fleury and al ghazi lock eyes then take in the tragedy of the room kids their childrens age never to be the same
al ghazi to the room in arabic is everyone alright
silent stares from the saudis
the little girl janet saw earlier eyes still on janet moves to her brother he holds her tight his eyes down
janet kneels heart breaking holds her hand out i can help you little one
the little girl holds a fist out to janet tears in her eyes okay
janet slowly crouches over to her the older womens eyes on her piercing
to the little girl in arabic its okay
little one trembles
one of the women in the corner calls to her in arabic sharp
janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist
her little hand opens shaking this is a gift for you
janets face ghost white little one is trying to give her a marble
al ghazi steps closer sees the marble
immediately looks over at the huddled mass the grandfather staring right back at him
we now see the old man clearly
al ghazi shaking slowly steps to him hands out
in arabic let me help you up old man
the old man nods a no
in arabic al ghazi rips grandfather up now
the family screams
al ghazi pulls the old mans hands from under his thobe missing fingers
bends at the knees to look the old man right in his eyes lifts his chin with his hand
dazed starting to realize hamza
the old man looks up at al ghazi rage and defiance
i got you
abu hamza you are under arrest
abu hamza stares hatred burning into al ghazi
you are a traitor to your country
a traitor to your god
i am no traitor to my god
al ghazis chest explodes before we hear the booms the year old grandson firing a cheap nickel plated mm
the family huddles that much closer to the floor
al ghazi falls back to the floor pulling grandfather with him
fleurys standing stock still out of body now he can only see a teenager built like a river reed like his own son
not a murderer who just shot his friend
quiet sick dont
the year old steps to the doorway pulls the trigger again the cheap mm jams
janet lifts up with her ak aims it at the boys chest
drop it son
the teenager wiping his tears so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon
half young boy the other half something much more dangerous
expert movements from his hands racking back the slide thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector letting the slide go racking another round into the chamber
fleury finally pulls his trigger
utter distortion as the old man reaches for the teenagers fallen hand gun
janet screaming raises her gun towards the old man as al ghazi shoots the old man in the chest
sobbing the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather
janet still screaming covers the family
the grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the little boys ear
tight on haytham taking it all in the bleeding dying teenager his hysterical sister hamza choking clutching for his grandson
chaos confusion conflict swirling in haythams eyes
a platoon of saudi police slowly enter the room
janet goes to the shot year old starts trying to stop the bleeding
fleury reaching for the dying al ghazi cradling him
tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man back down to al ghazi
fleury grasps al ghazis hand as a saudi man would
you got him
you got him
you got him
from the air as choppers hover and soldiers swarm
one last convoy heading out of town
fleury leavitt janet and sykes battered war scars million mile stares
our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a c touches down
haytham enters came to say good bye
the teams first smiles collective
fleury stares at haytham
thinks about what hes seen the past few days
how he has come to admire this kid
haytham smiling bandaged himself
halting and awkward he shakes janets hand
in arabic thank you
thank you lieutenant haytham
haytham says good bye to leavitt and sykes
comes to fleury
hands him a beautiful wooden prayer bead necklace
may peace be with you
may peace be with all of us my friend
the two men shake hands
alt omitted alt fleury sykes leavitt and janet sit around janets cubicle
bandages awkward silences and yard stares
subpoenas stacked on the corner of janets desk
leavitt quiet obviously fucked up

fleury gets up to follow
they head down the hallway
my dreams are
beat intent what did he whisper to you
confusion from janet
in the briefing
to get you to stop crying about fran
before any of this
before we even got airborne
what did he say to you
janet looks up leavitt waiting
the eight year old grandson
tears in his eyes standing in front of fresh graves
his aunt kneels down next to him tears flowing in arabic will you tell me what grandfather whispered to you before they took him
he turns to his aunt
leavitt still waiting do you remember
janet looks at leavitt pauses
reluctantly he said
well kill them all
alts we will win this
we will end this
we will finish this
the boy quietly answers in arabic dont worry well kill them all
and in his saucer wide brown eyes shrink wrapped in angry tears we see the parts of the future that will burn
sunlight shines tight on fleurys face stitches the length of his cheek remain
pull out fleury and his son throwing a baseball
lyla watches standing by a tree
father and son throwing the ball back and forth
you stop the people that hurt uncle fran
fleury stops just staring at his little son
tosses back the ball
did you get the bad guys daddy
fleury catches the ball stares at his son
tight on fleury he reaches and pulls his son close holding him for what might just be forever
alt he hands kevin al ghazis prayer beads
theres a lot of bad people out there
arent there daddy
yeah there are
a beat but you want to know something
youre not one of them
alt theres a lot of good guys too kevin smiles up at his dad
for the first time in a long while fleury smiles back
