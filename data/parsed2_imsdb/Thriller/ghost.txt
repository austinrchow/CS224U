screenplay by bruce joel rubin the camera tracks slowly through clouds of moving dust
shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere
an eerie netherworld envelops us
strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance
they seem like apparitions
broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light
we see hints of a huge demolished space
an old white plaster wall fills the screen
momentary blips of light flash across it
sounds of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance
with startling impact the sound of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere
the wall shudders
hammer blows assault the audience
they are loud and jarring
the wall buckles
chunks of plaster crash to the floor
the air fills with new swirls of white dust
the sledgehammer smashes into view
beams of sunlight cut through the cracks piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog
a huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air
we hear voices talking
what a mess
i told you
through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall all wielding sledgehammers
i cant breathe
use your mask dummy
one of the figures adjusts something over his face
isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air
singing volga boat
his hammer pounds the wall
the camera moves in and for the first time we see them
molly jensen in her late s has a bandanna around her hair and a workmans mask over her nose but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she
sam wheat in his late s is also hidden behind a mask but he has a strong forehead and handsome features
sweat is dripping down his brow leaving streaks in the dust
carl bruner early s removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two day stubble
both men have their shirts off
blackness and a loud thud
suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness
another thud and more light
we see a hole
the hook of a crowbar enters it grappling with something around the edges
then with a tug and a loud yank a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor
huge clouds of dust fly into the air
molly looks up astonished
sam look theres a whole eight feet up there
and about eighty years of dust
we have all this height sam
we could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs
that would leave all this space
eyeing her curiously for what
be great for bumper cars
carl laughs as he looks at sam
their bodies covered with white powder appear as strange ghostly figures
sam this may be none of my business but im concerned youre doing too much coke
sam glances down at his white body
they all laugh
hey sam turn around
molly doodles on his chest drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket
her lines are quick accomplished and subtly erotic
offering his body how bout me
she reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his
his stomach jumps sensually as she touches it
molly pulls back to admire her work
he looks like a greek statue
ill never wash again
sam molly and carl are holding their sledgehammers
molly begins to count
all together now
one they strike the wall with their hammers
the wall shakes two they pound again
the wall begins to give three
in unison they hit it once more
a massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground
new clouds of dust fill the air
suddenly sam spies an old jar lying on the floor
something rattles inside it a penny
hey look what i found
theres a penny inside
he hands it to molly for luck in our new loft
its a good omen
shaking her head disagreeing youre the good omen
she glances at him lovingly
carl looks at the two of them and grins
as the dust settles we see for the first time the outlines of the space they are working in
it is a huge loft over four thousand square feet
banks of windows run east and west
molly steps back and admires the room
you guys lucked out
hell i bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment
carl we just bought it
what i wouldnt do for a place like this
its gonna be great
it is morning rush hour
sam and carl both wearing suits and ties exit the wall street subway station and approach the headquarters of market security bank trust
oh by the way sam i had to move your with bob kahan to so you could squeeze in gary alan
he called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the danway stuff
three oclock was the only time he could make it
also the board meeting in l

sam seems preoccupied
continuing hey sam relax
this isnt brain surgery youre going into
i hate pitching to these japanese guys
they make me nervous
i mean what am i supposed to say who do you thinkll win that big sumo championship
sam youll be fine
youre great with people
sams jacket flares open
he is wearing yellow suspenders
continuing hey nice
i like those
sam not completely comfortable wearing them buttons his jacket
carl smiles and then turns to admire a car going by
jesus look at that a testerossa
thats the car im gonna drive when im making two hundred grand
better pay off your mustang first
sam and carl are standing on a crowded elevator
it is deadly quiet
suddenly carl elbows sam and winks
there is something he wants him to do
sam hesitates a moment annoyed and then relents
he clears his throat
so carl what did the doctor say
he said it was contagious
i shouldnt be going into work today
he coughs loudly but what could i do
people on the elevator freeze
and what about the rash
its spreading everywhere
on your genitals again
he said be sure not to touch anyone
we see people trying to inch away
carl coughs again
they hold their breath
the elevator stops at the next floor
all the passengers get off
sam and carl laughing walk through a large office area bustling with activity
employees in various cubicles are talking on telephones and punching information into computers
sam heads into his executive office
carl steps into a cubicle across the aisle
rose sams secretary approaches him
listen when the kobiashi people arrive have elenore take them right to the
theyre already here
she points to a windowed conference room
sam turns around and sees a large group of japanese men standing inside
and andy dillon called
he said they need transferred to albany by noon
he hurries over to carls cubicle
he is on the phone
carl cups the mouthpiece
listen dillon needs in albany by noon
can you transfer it to his payroll account
just let me have your mac code
sam pulls out his wallet and extracts a small address book
he jots the code numbers on a piece of paper and hands it to carl
ill do it right away
sam and a group of fifteen somber japanese businessmen are sitting around a large granite conference table
sam stands up and speaks a simple greeting to them
in japanese good morning gentlemen
on behalf of market security bank trust i welcome you to our city
the men smile happily and nod their heads in unison
they look to sam expecting more
uncomfortable he clears his throat
im afraid thats the only japanese i know
but i realize its not our language fluency or lack of it that brings you to market security
rather im sure it is our banking expertise our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs
as you know we are not the largest banking establishment in new york
his throat goes dry and he takes a sip of water but with combined assets of over billion dollars we have a firm commitment to the international marketplace
a secretary enters the room and hands sam a piece of paper
it reads molly on line
she hands him a phone
sam looks surprised
he nods apologetically to his guests
he picks up the receiver hello
dressed in a long clay covered smock
she is in a potters studio
several other potters are in the background working at their wheels
a five foot high ceramic vase stands beside molly
it is still wet
she toys with it as she speaks into the phone
a man and a woman are lying in bed when the womans husband suddenly comes home
frightened she tells the man he has to leave instantly through the window
he has no time to dress
straight faced listening and trying to look as if it is important
its raining outside
the man running naked along the street sees some joggers approaching
the entire contingent of japanese men is staring at sam
continuing one of the joggers calls out
hey do you always go jogging naked
and the man says yes always
and then the other jogger says and do you always wear a condom
the man looks down embarrassed and replies only when its raining
sam squelches a smile
well thats just fine
now just relax and have fun okay
its not the end of the world if you lose this account
youve always got me
ill remember that
he hangs up and stares at the japanese men
a short smile crosses his face
eight feet tall ascending into an afternoon sky
as the camera pulls back we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street
a group of workmen grab for the angel but have difficulty bringing it in
suddenly molly steps into the frame
where you guys from the new york city ballet
with a gutsy maneuver molly leans out over the sidewalk and tries to grab hold of the ropes
she cant reach them
suddenly a pair of hands grabs her around the waist
saved your life
sam laughs as he pulls her back into the loft
she does not think it is funny
dont do that to me
you scared me half to death
better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the street
here look out
sam jumps up grabs hold of the doors top molding and swings out over the sidewalk
sams feet push at the angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the loft
quickly he jumps back grabs hold of it and brings it in
the workmen applaud
molly eyes him with admiration
suddenly we hear a voice call out
molly looks to sam
did you invite him
under his breath i couldnt keep him away
carl enters shakes mollys hand and pats sam on the back
so hows it goin
before they can answer a workman turns to molly
where do you want this
in the bedroom
as the angel pulls away from camera we see the newly decorated loft for the first time
it is painted now in lovely pastels
the floor a huge gymnasium like expanse is lacquered with polyurethane
furniture and boxes are piling up along the walls
dominating the space with a kind of surreal presence are a large number of mollys sculptures and ceramics
there is also a vintage jukebox
carl is impressed
the place looks great
you like it huh
like is hardly the word
i never imagined it would be this beautiful
this is incredible
a mover lugs in a heavy old chair
molly sees it
sam you kept that chair
what do you mean
i love that chair
but it doesnt go with anything
it goes with me
its okay ill paint it
sam pinches her ass
sam molly and carl are sprawled out on the floor eating from cartons of chinese food
frank a gray cat eats beside them
unpacked boxes are scattered everywhere
it was the middle of december
i was sitting in my old office the one charlies in
suddenly i heard this woman screaming
i thought someoned been shot or something
they took away my mastercard
it was christmas for godssake
she was four thousand dollars over her limit
it wasnt four thousand
and id already sent in the payment
youre the ones that lost it
shes still angry
no im not
the cat begins nibbling sams food
get outta here frank
the cat scampers away you should have seen her
all pink and flushed
her skin was gorgeous like a rose
and shes screaming demanding to see the president
so wilton brought her to me
you werent even a vp yet
she didnt know that
can you believe it
and the next thing i know hes telling me his life story
i couldnt believe it
about his divorce how hed just arrived in new york how he didnt know any women
and all with this montana accent
whats a montana accent
the one you always slip into it when you get nervous
thank you maam

laughing i wasnt nervous
you liked me
you were interested
matter of factly i thought you were cute
looking at carl do you believe this
i should have been picassos mistress
i should have been living in barcelona or paris
but no im moving in with a new york banker who thinks im cute
she looks at sam and grins
carl is staring at molly obviously turned on by her
he is embarrassed when she catches his gaze and quickly looks away
molly dressed only in a t shirt is sitting at her potters wheel throwing a series of pots
sam enters the studio
he is barefoot shirtless wearing jeans
what are you doing
i felt inspired
she nods and presses her hands into a pot that is forming in front of her
sam watches the sensual movement of her fingers molding and forming the clay
she is forceful assured gifted
the clay responds to her slightest effort
slowly almost unconsciously sam reaches for her shoulders and begins kissing them
continuing you notice carls eyes today
they were all over you
are you jealous
sam let me tell you something
hes not even looking at me
its you he idolizes
he doesnt see me at all
anyway hes not my type
sam reaches over her and gently adds his fingers to the clay
molly looks up at him
continuing what are you doing
i feel inspired
his hands dig into the clay
their fingers seem to dance together
after a moment she reaches up to him her clay covered fingers streaking his face and curving down to his chest
sam grins and reaches down to her
as it presses two buttons on his jukebox
we watch as the mechanical arm selects a record and slowly sensuously lowers it to the turntable
the arm hovers over the record and then descends
it begins to play
the song is unchained melody by the righteous brothers
are dancing in the middle of the dark loft
moonlight pours through the windows and shines off the floor
wads of packing paper swirl sensuously around their feet
molly runs her fingers down sams naked back
the moment is sweet and erotic
we watch as sam slowly draws his fingers down over mollys face gently caressing her forehead her eyes her lips
sam slides his hands under mollys t shirt slowly moving them toward her breasts
her breathing slows
they dance silently her hair swaying in the soft light
we hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor
sensuously mollys shirt lifts above her navel as sam presses into her
their stomachs touch and part and touch again
she bites her lip
sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest slowly moving her fingers down his torso around the curve of his hips and then digging into the back of
sam leans into molly and nips at her neck
she stops dancing
her eyes close
she stands absolutely still
sams hands move to her backside
he pulls her closer
sam and molly making love on the livingroom carpet
paper and packing materials crumble beneath them and scatter across the floor
for all their sensuality it is their hands and eyes that are most expressive revealing a tenderness that is deeply moving
their lovemaking is full of love
the song ends
the jukebox arm retracts and gently slides the record back into its slot
sam and molly are lying together silently
molly gazes at him
whats the matter
i can tell
youre worried arent you
about moving in together
i dont know
a lot of things
i just dont want the bubble to burst
whenever something good happens to me im just afraid im going to lose it
molly gently strokes his head
you know what
i love you
i really love you
he smiles and strokes her cheek
suddenly the t
blares into the room
sam jumps up grabbing the remote control unit from under his buttocks
molly laughs as he turns the sound down
the news is on and they are showing the remains of an airline disaster
sam stares at the tube
dont watch that stuff
he motions to wait
dead bodies litter the screen
it is estimated that people died in the crash the second in less than two weeks
sam confused spins around
molly is holding the remote control
she nods for him to lie down
i should cancel my l
these things always happen in threes
sam get serious
besides you lead a charmed life
so did they
sam looks at her and then back at the screen
continuing amazing huh
he snaps his fingers just like that
sam is sitting at his computer
his address book with his access codes is sitting open beside him
he seems perplexed by something happening on the screen
after pushing a series of buttons and getting the same response he whacks the computer on the side
carl walking in the door sees him
sam looks up sheepishly
the mark greenberg and larry white accounts
i cant get in
your mac code doesnt work
i changed it
i just want to nose around a bit
can you keep your mouth shut
tell me whats going on
i think ive stumbled onto something
theres too much money in these accounts
too much money
how could there be too much money
thats what i keep asking myself
it must be the computer
ive been checking
he hits the computer like sam did and laughs come on move over
let me see what i can do
im gonna dig around a bit
just call me when youre ready for help
he heads for the door so what are you and moll doing tonight
were going to the theatre
she wants to see macbeth at the spring street repertory
sam and molly are sitting in the fifth row of a crowded auditorium
he is sound asleep
a scene from macbeth
sam begins to snore
molly grabs his nose
he jerks awake
bright marquee lights sparkle overhead as sam and molly exit the theatre
it is a beautiful brisk night
i loved it
i could tell
she smiles and squeezes his arm
they walk silently down a dark street heading toward their loft
the pavement is full of shadows
continuing did i tell you what marcia said
no i didnt
sam dont be so blase
ill have two major pieces in the show
the new york times reviews her gallery all the time
this could be huge
molly the new york times is some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked out of art school
who cares what the new york times thinks
eight million readers thats who
your works beautiful
thats a fact moll
it doesnt matter what anyone thinks
we can tell from the expression on mollys face that it does
sam puts his arm around her
she nestles close to him
then suddenly she stops and looks up
there is an unexpected seriousness in her voice
continuing i want to marry you sam
taken aback what
ive been thinking about it for days
more than thinking
i want to do it
i want to jump in whole hog
she pauses what is that look for
staring at her its just been so long since
i mean you never wanted to talk about it
there is a long pause
do you love me sam
what do you think moll
how come you never say it
what are you talking about
you say ditto
its not the same
people say i love you all the time
it doesnt mean anything
sometimes you need to hear it
sam stops and stares at molly
he pauses quietly
he is about to speak when a mans face emerges from the shadows behind him
sam spins around
is standing in the darkness between two buildings
he stares at the couple for a moment and then steps onto the sidewalk
sam and molly stand motionless
the man hesitates and then begins walking the other way
molly exhales a deep breath
sam takes mollys arm and they continue briskly down the street
suddenly they hear footsteps coming after them
what should we do
let me handle this
sam stops abruptly and turns around
a gun is staring him in the face
sam waits a beat
give it to him
sam reaches for his jacket
the mugger grabs his wrist and then carefully pulls the wallet out himself
take the money
just leave the wallet and my
he swipes sam across the head
the mugger whacks her across the face
sam explodes plowing into the mugger with all his might
there is a wild all out brawl
sam fights like a mad man
suddenly the gun goes off
the mugger panics and takes off running
sam charges after him
the two men run down the dark street but the mugger is already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows
sam gives up
slowly he turns and begins walking back toward molly
we can see molly dimly at the end of the block as sam approaches
she is screaming for help
frightened sam calls out
she doesnt answer
sam tenses and starts running toward her
he is just three feet away when suddenly he stops
an expression of pure terror overwhelms his face
drenched in blood
her eyes are glazed on the verge of shock
panting she stoops down to the curb as the camera travels with her
she grabs hold of something lying in the shadows and pulls it toward her
it is sams dead body she is holding in her arms
sams ghostly form still solid to all appearances stands beside molly
his eyes are awash in horror and confusion
he seems unable to move
the camera holds on his face as the full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes
suddenly he lets out a blood curdling scream
he jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold of his motionless form
his hands make a strange sound as they pass right though it
it is terrifying
sam jumps up crazed frenzied and begins circling molly
it is as though he is trying to undo what has been done
continuing this isnt happening
its not happening
he reaches out to molly for help
his hand cuts through her shoulder
people are running down the street
the sound of sirens can be heard in the distance
two men run toward sam
he yells out at them
continuing help me
they run right through him
he gasps in stunned terror
sam watches helplessly as they reach his body
molly looks up and begins screaming hysterically
one of the men grabs her as the other goes for sams wrist
there is no sign of life
the first man holds molly back as his friend stoops down and begins some form of cardio pulmonary resuscitation
there is no response
sam bends down trying desperately to help
it is a futile gesture
the man bangs on sams chest
blood gushes from the wound
he bangs again
sam shoots up in bed panting
it is dark
he stares around the loft in sudden confusion
with a lurch he flicks on the night light
molly is lying beside him her head buried beneath a pillow
sam seems stunned
tears stream down his face
whats the matter
is something wrong
sam is so relieved to hear her voice that he can hardly breathe
what is it honey
molly groggy tries to sit up
sam reaches out for her
as she turns around we see a skeletel version of her head staring at the camera
mocking him what is it honey
sam bolts upright screaming
it is a scream so consumed by terror that one fears it will never stop
asleep in bed
he is thrashing at his pillow and moaning
suddenly a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder
sam jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets
molly is sitting on the bed looking at him afraid
sam stares down at her
he is breathing heavily not trusting his own senses
his hands clutch at the wall
whats happening to me
suddenly a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a host of glowing forms radiating an intense inner light float before us
a blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite vortex behind them
sam is awed and confused
we sense that the light is enchanting him
the entire room begins to disappear in the light
dont leave me
i need you sam
sam turns and sees molly only she is not in the bed
she is back on the street
to his amazement he is on the street too still bathed in the soothing light
frightened he calls out to her
she does not hear him
he calls again
there is no response
sam deeply troubled hesitates for a moment
he is torn between molly and the light
then in a painful but conscious gesture he turns from the light and walks toward molly
at that instant the light behind him disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing
there is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates into the void
sam is left on the dark pavement
he stands there a moment as if in shock and then begins running toward molly
an ambulance is rounding the corner
swirls of light speed toward the ambulance as car headlights and streetlamps merge in a wild dizzying rush
the siren wails into the night
sams body is lying in the back of the ambulance as a paramedic applies electric paddles to his chest in an effort to save him
after a moment he looks up at molly
we can tell from the expression in his eyes that it is hopeless
im not dead
molly kneeling over sams body grabs him and begins to cry in long terrible sobs
a doctor comforting molly accompanies her from one of the emergency operating rooms and leads her through a pair of swinging doors into a separate waiting area
we see two policemen and two detectives stand up and approach her
sam doesnt want molly to go and begins to follow her but then seems torn afraid to leave his body
he turns back just as his corpse covered in a green sheet is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall
sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it
a wrinkled old man approaches sam and joins him on the bench
he begins talking
so what happened to you
sam is startled amazed that the man can see him
youre new huh
i can tell
are you talking to me
it aint like before you know
its a whole new ball a wax
who are you
im waiting for my wife
shes in c
shes fighting it
the man sticks his head into the green sheet covering sams body
his head disappears
sam is terrified
continuing shot huh
thatll do it every time
well get used to it
you could be here a long time
leaning in close ill tell you a secret
doors aint as bad as you think
they aint nothin at all
youll catch on
suddenly there is a loud commotion and we see several physicians operating furiously on an old man lying on the table beside them
it is a life threatening situation and they seem to be failing
continuing he aint gonna make it
ive seen it a million times
hes a goner
here they come
could have been the other ones
you never know
before sam can understand what is happening the entire room fills with a strange preternatural light
suddenly he looks up and freezes
the amorphous forms he saw right after he died are floating down through the ceiling and reaching for the body on the operating table
they are emitting a powerful light
hurry were losing him
whatd i tell you
the glowing forms take hold of the mans spirit and help extract it from his body
his physical form changes instantly from a solid object into an ethereal substance
sam stares in amazement as the strange beings carry the spirit upward
they evaporate through the ceiling
the light in the room grows dull instantly
nurses cover the dead man with a dark sheet as the doctors step away
sam turns to the old man
who are you
the man isnt there
an orderly approaches the gurney with sams body and begins pushing it toward the elevator
sam jumps in front of him
as the stretcher begins to roll right through him
the penetration of his physical space is horrifying to sam
he stands almost paralyzed as the body of the orderly intersects with his
it is a stunning moment of extraordinary strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the orderlys body passing through his
it is like a glimpse of ultimate chaos the universe within
then in a flash the orderly has passed through but sam is still shaking
he stares up at the ceiling
oh god help me
as the ceiling lights and acoustical tiles begin to blur
the hallway grows dark
it is as though sam is blacking out
slowly images begin to emerge out of the blackness
it takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from sams funeral
the camera tracks along rows of mourners as seen from sams p
he seems to be floating among them
we hear snippets of conversations
it all seems strangely odd and disjointed
time seems unfixed malleable
we see a minister standing beside the grave
as we say farewell to our friend sam wheat we are reminded of his kindness his generosity his buoyancy of spirit
the camera keeps moving
sams associates from the bank are among the mourners
continuing all that we treasure our friends our loved ones our body our mind are but on loan to us
we must surrender them all
we are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end
sam notices a woman in a fancy print dress comforting one of the mourners
the woman looks up at him smiles and waves
sam is surprised
he looks behind him but no one is there
as he turns back the woman is walking away
she appears just like any normal person until she approaches a large gravestone and passes right through it
sam is shocked
as our loved one enters eternal life let us remember that love too is eternal that although we will miss him our love will light the void and dispel the
suddenly molly enters the frame
sam spots her
the camera molly
she does not respond
ruth her sister leans over to her
tears form in mollys eyes
a hand reaches out to give her a tissue
molly looks up
it is carl
she gives him her hand
he squeezes it with affection
and into your hands we commend his spirit
may he rest in peace
in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost
the casket is lowered into the ground
molly approaches the grave
she us a little unsteady
carl takes her elbow
a shovel is placed in her hands
with great emotional effort she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket
it lands with a reverberating finality
leaving the cemetery
we hear them talking
what time you going back to work
whats the buzz on digital
he was so young
hows your new honda
going away this weekend
down the hill people are getting back into their cars
sam can see molly being let into a limousine
he stands there staring at his own casket grieving
then after a moment he turns away
separating from his body from his own grave site he runs after her
molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft surrounded by friends and well wishers
a young girl her niece cuddles in her lap
people are eating and milling around
slowly the camera begins to pan
it ends on sam standing alone in a corner
in the midst of all the activity he is lost and alone
raw clay on a potters wheel spins hypnotically sensuously
mollys wet hands press in shaping it molding it
a bowl begins to appear
the camera pulls back and reveals sam
he is sitting on the floor behind her knees pressed to his chest rocking aimlessly
molly looks away from the bowl she is forming
it distorts and bends
angry she digs her finger into it
the bowl disintegrates
tears form in her eyes
frank jumps up on the bench beside her
molly stares sadly around the room
quietly she begins talking to herself to the air
oh god sam
sam looks up
continuing i picked up your shirts this morning
i dont know why
reynolds said to tell you hello
i broke into tears
its so hard
sam walks over to molly
desperate for contact he reaches out to touch her cheek but then hesitates and pulls back
continuing i think about you every minute
its like youre still here like i can feel you sam
he stares at her hoping wondering
i am here moll
suddenly as if hearing sams voice the cat begins to hiss
molly spins around
the cat scans the room
unexpectedly sams and the cats eyes meet
with a wild screech the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running
molly stands up
frank whats wrong
the cat is nowhere to be seen
all of a sudden molly freezes
sam is standing right beside her
it is almost as though she senses his presence
continuing whispering sam
she holds very still for a moment
sam watches breathlessly loving her wanting her
then quietly hopefully he reaches out
it is a useless gesture
in a moment of great poignancy molly shakes her head and walks right through him
he remains in the frame alone
sam stands in the corner of a large walk in closet watching as molly goes through his effects
boxes scattered underfoot are filling up with his lifes possessions
molly reaches for a shirt
not that one
thats my favorite
she tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater
it is obviously handmade about four sizes too big
sam recognizes it
molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek
after a moment she puts it back
then in a surprising outburst she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves
everything comes flying off
sam reaches out to console her
continuing molly dont
unexpectedly carl comes rushing into the room
he takes hold of molly and sits her on the bed
continuing say something
help her carl
its very hard
sarcastic oh good
thats really good
molly and carl are standing over the kitchen table folding piles of sams clothes and placing them into boxes
as molly lifts one of sams jackets something falls from a side pocket
it is his small black leather address book
sam stares at it with recognition
carl sees the book fall and stoops to pick it up but molly gets it first
sams address book
she skims through it a moment but the memories it evokes are too powerful for her
she places it carefully into a box labeled sams things valuable and continues packing
she finds the old jar with the penny in it
its marked for luck
she holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it on the nightstand beside the bed
carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of sams jackets
he examines them
should i toss em
molly we hated that concert
she takes the stubs and lovingly puts them in the box
carl finds a half used package of rolaids
molly takes them from his hand and puts them in the box too
oh you want to save those
what are you doin moll
molly just stares for a moment
i miss him carl
carl comes over and takes her hand
we all do
molly buries her head on his shoulder
carl strokes her hair
carl lifting a pile of boxes and carrying them to the door
suddenly molly yells out
not that one
she hurries over and pulls the valuable box from the stack in his arms
he looks at it with surprise
i dont know how that got in there
he turns to the door and then back to molly
continuing hey moll
why dont you come
its like summer outside
just for a stroll
itd be good to get out
molly shakes her head and turns away
i cant do it carl
carl annoyed walks over to her
youre not the one who died
molly stops and looks at him
he has struck home
after a moment she nods her head
just a short walk
he gently squeezes her shoulders
before sam even understands what is happening they are exiting the loft
sam jumps up and runs after them
the door slams shut
sam is locked inside
frightened and desperate he rushes for the door knob
his hand sinks through it
there is a strange sound like electrical static as it penetrates the metal and wood
frightened he yanks it back
sam circles the space several times and then returns to the door
clenching his teeth he reaches out again
as his hand pushes up against it we sense that he experiences a subtle resistance
the hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his ghostly form presses into it
we sense sams fear as his entire arm disappears from view
the grating electrical sound shudders up his spine
the sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but sam does not pull back
slowly he edges in and presses his face into the molecules of the wood
as atoms and electrons spin past him at frightening speed
there is a sense of a universe in total chaos
terrifying sounds charge through his body
pulling back from the door
he is trembling
he is sitting in a corner singing quietly to himself
singing bye bye miss american pie
drove my chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
them good ol boys were drinkin whiskey and rye and singing thisll be the day that i
he stops realizing the last word of the song
he sits silently staring at the wall
suddenly there is a sound at the door
sams eyes shoot up
the door begins to open
sam stands up
his face begins to tighten
we know instantly that something is wrong
his eyes fill with a fury we have not seen before
the mugger the man who killed sam is entering the loft
he has a key in his hand and puts it in his pocket
sam is stunned
the mugger locks the door
sam goes wild
he shoots at the man with all his might attacking him unceasingly but with no effect
his hands and feet pass right through him
you motherfucking bastard
what the hell are you doing here
what are you doing
the mugger unaware that anything is going on glances around nervously as he moves through the vast space
entering the bedroom the mugger goes to the dresser and quickly examines the drawers
he is very neat careful to leave no sign that he was there
he seems to be looking for something but cannot find it
suddenly we hear a key turning in the front door
the mugger seems startled
he dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly behind one of the large sculptures
we hear the door open
molly is standing there
sam goes crazy
molly closes the door and locks it shut
sam freezes as she heads for the bedroom
she walks right past the mugger
to sams horror she stops and turns to look around
there is a curious expression on her face
seeing nothing she continues through the loft
the mugger pulls out his gun
sam looks on in absolute terror
mollys purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove her clothes
she turns on the radio
sam doesnt know what to do
the mugger seems excited by mollys semi nudity
he begins skirting the edges of the loft moving toward the bedroom
sam is crazed
suddenly out of nowhere frank appears at the muggers feet
sams eyes light up
he drops to his knees crawls over to him glares into his eyes and screams
screeches and jumps straight up
his claws shoot out at the muggers face ripping into the flesh near his eye
the mugger sees it dripping through his fingers
the sight of it upsets him
he grabs the cat angrily by the neck
molly in her bra peers from the bedroom
frank whats wrong
the mugger holds the cats mouth shut
seeing and hearing nothing molly steps back into the bedroom
the mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor
holding his eye he gets up and rushes for the exit
sam runs after him but the door closes before he can get through
he is left inside
stares at the closed door in a wild panic
he doesnt know what to do
then summoning all of his courage he takes a blind running slow motion leap and charges through it
there is a brief sense of passing through a molecular force field a miniature universe inside the door
as he emerges from the door and lands on the other side
he seems excited to have survived and is very pleased with himself
the mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward the subway
a patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his eye
sam starts after the man but instantly freezes
hordes of people crowd the sidewalk
the crush of humanity is frightening
two lovers holding hands are coming right at him
before sam is able to move we hear the sound of their arms cutting through his ghostly form
sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people approach him from all angles
we hear a baby carriage roll through sams feet and he nearly falls over trying to avoid it
his instincts will not let go
a barrage of images and sounds assaults sam
it is more than he can handle
still he refuses to give up
he stays close to the mugger
the mugger heads down a flight of steps into the irt
the mugger gets onto a crowded subway car
sam stands near a corner of the train watching him
suddenly sam notices that something odd is happening
one of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward him
as he approaches the mugger he does not stop but passes right through him
it takes sam a moment to realize what is happening but then it is too late
with unholy fury the new ghost charges into sam
the attack is so unexpected and ferocious that sam has no sense of how to defend himself
with unexpected power the ghost grabs hold of him and slams him into the subway door
sams head plows right through it
on sams head sticking outside of the car as the subway tunnel rushes past him
there is a panicked look on his face
the look intensifies as he turns and sees another train barreling down on him
on sams body inside the car still struggling with the ghost as the other train shoots by the window
with a huge gasp sam shoots back into the car and wrests himself free of the ghosts hold
the ghost flies after him screeching
sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds himself on the bridge between the subway cars
the subway ghost stares at him through the window with a wild insane look
this is mine
with shocking impact the ghosts fist goes flying into the window
to sams terror and amazement the window shatters
the ghost smiles
passengers scream and sam dives for cover
sam stares at the broken glass with fascination and confusion
suddenly the train moves from the darkness of the tunnel into broad daylight
the train stops at an elevated subway platform in brooklyn
sam sees the mugger exiting the train and frantically rushes after him
sam follows the mugger down a long covered staircase to the street
the mugger heads toward prospect place
the streets are lined with old apartment buildings
many windows are boarded up
two men standing on the corner are slamming a piece of heavy machinery onto the pavement
sam hears gospel music coming from a storefront church and notices a sign sister oda mae brown medium spirit reader advisor
he looks up to a third story window and sees a similar sign with day glo arrows pointing to the entrance on the street
he seems curious but then realizes that the mugger is nearly halfway down the block
he turns and rushes after him
sam and the mugger approach a tenement building at prospect place
sam follows the mugger into the building and watches as he opens the mail box for apt
the name scribbled across it is willie lopez
theres no mail
sam enters willies apartment
it is a squalid affair
peeled paint chips litter the floor
the bed is unmade
willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops in the keys to mollys loft
sam sees his wallet
his drivers license bank id and a photo of molly are there too
furious sam lunges for willie but then holds his punch knowing it will have no effect
he turns instead to a window and like the ghost on the subway smashes it with his fist
willie dials the phone
someone comes on the line
she came home
i couldnt get it
give me a couple of days
ill go back
he hangs up
sam stares at him in wild confusion
who the hell are you
what were you doing at mollys
what the hells going on
willie grabs a bottle of wine from the nightstand and lies down
after a moment he reaches over and takes mollys photo from the drawer
he studies it slowly
sam stands by the door in a state of motionless rage
there is nothing he can do
continuing stay away from her
sam storms down the street
his movements seem undirected utterly aimless
he is seething inside
suddenly sam looks up
an old bag lady is walking down the street talking loudly to a short woman tagging along beside her
as they approach a street pole the bag lady swerves to the side
the short woman however walks right through it
passersby laugh at the old lady talking to herself
sam unsettled rushes away
as sam rounds a corner a sudden blast of music explodes out of nowhere
sam jumps into the street gasping
a phonograph needle scratches across a record and the music stops
a womans voice booms out sorry bout that
to a pair of loudspeakers in a storefront window
the music blares out once more and sounds of gospel fill the street
sam looks up
he is back in front of the storefront church with the sign for sister oda mae brown medium spirit reader advisor hanging overhead
below it is another sign
contact the dearly departed
sam stares at the sign with curiosity
the music is compelling
after a moments hesitation he goes in the open door
a record player is sitting near the storefront window a makeshift microphone placed in front of it
several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with nothing on it
a number of people are sitting there mostly women
one gets the sense that this is a cross between a waiting room and a meeting hall
a black woman steps up on the platform and calls out rosa santiago
santiago tucks a spanish paperback romance into her purse and heads to a door at the rear of the hall
sam follows after her
santiago enters a dark room with a window and door leading to a side street
a paisley bedspread is tacked over the window
in the center of the room is a round seance table
two heavyset sisters clara and louise are standing beside an open closet
it is empty
please be seated
santiago sits at the table
she seems apprehensive
clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as though demonstrating that they are solid
my sister will be with us soon
she steps back out and closes the door
louise inserts a tape into a boom box and then steps forward
sister oda mae
grant us the gift of your all seeing presence
appear for us now
she turns back to the closet and opens the door
like magic oda mae brown appears standing inside
she is a black woman in a white tunic
the whiteness of her garment makes it look as if she is glowing in the dark
santiago is wide eyed
sam smiles as oda mae steps into the room
she takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it to oda mae
clara graciously intercepts the money
i understand you are hoping to contact your husband
well i believe hes gonna be with us today
oh tsank you tsank you
tears well up in her eyes
she crosses herself several times
but theres no telling about the other world
you gotta cast out all doubt
you gotta believe
do you believe
nodding her head vigorously si
and remember we dont make no promises
i can phone up there till im blue in the face she points to the ceiling but it dont necessarily mean hes gonna be home
them folks go shopping they play bingo
its just like here
you cant always get em
santiago utterly fascinated nods understandingly
oda maes eyes glance up curiously for a second as though she heard something and then she continues
okay lets get ready then
sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves behind oda mae
the moment feels rehearsed theatrical
oda mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes
there is a hush in the room
her body begins to tremble
santiago clutches her chair
suddenly oda mae breaks out of her trance
we got a problem here
i dont think hes in
i feel something
did he know someone whos passed over someone named anna
i knew it
hes with his mama
sarcastic oh my god
oda maes eyes dart uncomfortably around the room
im afraid this is gonna be too hard
now i got two souls i gotta contact
i dont know about that
its difficult you know
i pay more
way to go
milk her for every penny
oda mae jumps up and stares at her sisters
they look back at her curiously
they cant figure out whats wrong
neither can oda mae
santiago reaches into her purse
a twenty dollar bill changes hands
sam watches amazed at it all
oda mae sits down and goes back into her trance
her eyeballs roll up into their sockets
praise the lord
thank you jesus
oda mae is beginning to shake again
the two women grab her shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair
suddenly her whole body stiffens
continuing have mercy
santiago stares on in amazement
after a moment oda maes body collapses in a heap
then like a phoenix rising from the ashes she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes a normal pose
after several seconds to get her bearings oda mae begins to speak
only now she has an entirely new voice
it sounds deep and hoarse like an old mans
for all its put on theatricality it is strangely convincing
welcome rosa santiago
you are fortunate today
the channel is clear
many spirits are gathering
scanning the room yeah
oda mae jerks
her eyes dart nervously around the room
a bit uneasy i can feel his vibration
yes yes he is drawing toward us now
i can see him coming
how is he
how does he look
oh he is a very handsome man
in our fathers kingdom we are all handsome
sam looks on dismayed
he is standing before me
he is wearing a black suit
a black suit
oh yes yes
he was buried in that
santiago begins to cry
sam looks around the room with growing disgust
then he leans over to oda mae and yells into her ear
what a crock of shit
oda mae nearly falls off her chair
she spins around
sam is stunned
clara and louise look at one another in total confusion
this is obviously not part of the act
santiago seems frightened
continuing where are you
looking around who
oda mae screams and jumps up thrashing at the air
her knee kicks the table and sends it toppling
santiago is terrified
whats going on
get out of here
leave me alone
santiago doesnt know what to do
she begins to cry
who are you talking to
clara runs up to oda mae
keep him away
louise looks at the empty room
are you talking to me
clara just stares at her sister
sam is excited and amazed
i dont believe this
my name is sam wheat
can you hear me
say my name
talk to me oda mae
sam nearly falls on his face
claras eyes widen
she is more confused than ever
oda mae runs into the closet
it has a false panel leading to a hidden chamber on the left side and she barricades herself inside it
clara and louise stand outside pulling on the handle
they seem frightened
oda mae is rocking back and forth on the floor praying
sams feet enter the frame beside her
lord i swear no more cheatin
i promise lord
i dont want to go to hell
ill do anything
gimme a penance
just make him go away
im stayin right here
oda mae screams jumps back into the closet and bolts up against the door
it tears from its hinges and falls into the seance room nearly crushing louise
santiago runs out screaming
oda mae takes one look around and collapses in a dead faint
beads of sweat collect on oda maes brow and cheeks
she seems feverish
clara and louise are sitting beside her with damp towels nervously soaking up the perspiration
oda mae appears to be talking to herself until we pull back and reveal sam nearby
my mama her mama may they rest in peace they had de gift
mama always said i had it but i never did
she tol me all about it how it felt an all
but now that its happenin i dont know what to do

mimicking his words im standing right beside you

oda mae gulps a horrified expression on her face
the telephone rings
molly preparing dinner runs to answer it

she hesitates im calling for a friend of yours
he asked me to call
this is important
you gotta believe me

molly slams down the receiver panting
for several seconds she doesnt move
slowly she walks to the couch and sits down
she is trembling
oda mae hangs up the phone
whatd i tell you

look i dont care what you do to me im not goin nowhere
sam is sitting on the edge of oda maes bed singing
it sounds like hes been singing for hours
he is very hoarse

oda mae bolts upright in her bed her hands over her ears
you just shut your mouth
sam and oda mae are sitting at the rear of a crowded bus
she appears to be talking to herself
i cant believe im doin this
i gotta be a crazy lady goin into the city with you
i never go there
what the hell you doin in my life huh
several people move away
oda mae approaches the loft building and buzzes mollys apartment
she waits a few moments
theres nobody there
i did what i promised
i said id come and im here
i didnt say anything bout waitin
just one more time
its a big place
oda mae turns to leave
sam desperate starts to sing
continuing ninety nine bottles of beer on the wall ninety nine bottles of beer oda mae stops
she turns back to the buzzer and rings once more
suddenly molly answers
hello whos there
nervous dont go away
its oda mae brown
i called you last night
your friend sam says you gotta talk to me
there is a click as molly hangs up
molly walks away from the intercom shaken
suddenly we hear oda mae yelling up from the street
hey you molly
you gotta listen to me
this is for real
sam is here
he needs to talk to you
molly walks over to the window and looks down
oda mae is standing in the street looking up
she is calling out at the top of her lungs
molly pulls back
she is afraid
continuing he says remember the starfish at montego bay
remember the picture he took a you in reno
pause remember his green underwear the pair you wrote your name on
she wrote her name on em
there is a sign of recognition in her eyes
oda mae is standing by the curb and shouting up to mollys fifth floor window
several people stare at her curiously
she turns to them
hey do you mind
this heres a private conversation
the people turn away
she turns back to the window
sam prompts her
ask her about the sweater in the closet the one she knitted thats too big
what about the sweater you knitted that was too big
she couldnt throw it out
i was there
you couldnt throw it out
he was there
this is for real
hey do you hear me up there
a workman peers out of a second story window
i hear you
im not talkin to you
havent you ever heard of phones
kiss my behind
yelling again listen im not gonna stand here all day
ive had enough of this
oda mae is about to walk away when the entrance door opens
molly steps outside
oda mae sees her and stops
molly nods im oda mae brown
walking over and shaking her hand you can call me oda
molly and oda mae are sitting in a booth staring at one another
why should i believe you
why should i believe any of this

sam is dead
im holding her hand
he says hes holding your hand
mollys hand jumps
oda mae looks at her
there is a long poignant moment
sam chokes up
god i love her
i love her so much
he says he loves you
shaking her head no
he would never say that
his eyes brightening ditto
tell her ditto
whats that mean ditto
molly starts an expression of true astonishment shining in her eyes
molly is pressed up against the edge of the couch listening nervously as oda mae speaks
sam wanders around the room anxiously
to tell the truth i dont know how im doin it
in fack confidentially nothin like this never happened to me before
now all a sudden i cant turn it off
she sees a photo of sam is this you
is this him
they both say yes at the same time
continuing to sam hazel eyes huh
you sound like theyd be blue
i dont understand
why did he come back
why is he still here
cause hes stuck thats why
hes between worlds
it happens sometimes when their spirits get out too quick
he thinks he still has stuff tdo down here
come on oda mae stop rambling
oh oh now hes got an attitude
molly stares at oda mae
i do not have an attitude
to molly were having a discussion
back to sam whataya mean youre not angry
if you werent angry you wouldnt be raisin your voice like that
goddamn it oda mae
ah ah baby

i dont talk to anybody who takes the lords name in vain
she stands up as if to leave
molly watches with growing discomfort as oda mae seems to be talking to herself
relax oda mae
youre the dead one
you want my help then you apologize
nobody talks to me like that understand
to molly excuse me girl
time for me to go
oda mae heads for the door
molly is confused
i dont believe im watching this
oda mae stops pauses a moment and walks back to the couch
sam relieved paces back and forth
oda maes eyes follow his voice as molly watches her curiously
continuing please oda mae i need you to tell molly what im saying
you gotta tell her word for word
monsieur has a message for you
molly youre in danger
you cant tell her like that
and would you stop movin all over the place

molly looks concerned
sam leans into oda mae
hes sayin youre in danger
what do you mean
i know the man who killed me
i know where he lives
he says he knows the man who killed him willie lopez
hes puerto rican
molly grows pale as she listens
her forehead tightens
write it down
write it down
you do it
now im a secretary
oda mae takes a card from her purse and grabs a pencil
hey thats my neighborhood
oda mae seems perplexed as she writes it down and gives it to molly
molly hes got my wallet and my key
he was in here
hes got his wallet and key
he was in here
directly to molly you have to go to the police
the mugger wasnt acting alone
it was a setup moll
i was murdered
he says he was set up that he was murdered
he wants you to go to the police
molly stands up afraid
oda mae stands up too
continuing im sorry
i dont want nothin to do with this
oda mae heads for the door as molly watches in a daze
where you going
dont follow me
ive done all im gonna do
opening the door im finished
and i aint comin back
so dont you come botherin me again cause its over
i mean it
this is it
have a nice life

she lets herself out
sam just stands there as the door slams shut
carl is pacing nervously
he seems very upset
after a moment he approaches molly
sam is behind her
molly theres no one on earth whod like it to be true more than me but youve got to be rational about this
i understand your desire to hold on to him but this
this is absurd
it was real carl
she was real
listen to her carl goddamn it
she needs some support here
molly youre a grown woman
how can you believe some fortune teller from brooklyn
she was in touch with him
i dont believe it molly
not for a minute
come on carl
open your mind
carl sits down beside her
carl she knew things
what kind of things
i told you the picture in reno the starfish
damn it carl
with great difficulty she said sam knew who killed him
that he was set up
this is getting deranged
were going off the deep end here
give him the address moll
she had a name an address willie lopez prospect place
she said he had sams wallet
carl stands up
his voice begins to rise
this is sick
this is really sick
how can you swallow this crap
who knows if this guy exists
maybe shes just setting someone up
thats what i have to find out
what are you talking about
sam wants me to go to the police
sam wants you to go to the police
are you outta your mind
what are you gonna tell em
some storefront psychics been getting messages from the dead
do you know how that sounds
youre talkin ghosts here for gods sake
molly looks suddenly vulnerable
continuing im sorry
this stuff just really gets to me
you dont believe me
you dont believe any of this do you
half heartedly im trying to but
look if itll make you sleep any better ill check it out okay
now why dont you go to bed
try and get some sleep
molly looks at carl annoyed
she doesnt believe him for a second
carl in his red ford mustang is speeding up town
sam is beside him in the front seat
carl steps into the lobby of willies building
sam follows wide eyed
he seems both intrigued and astounded by what carl is doing
when carl stops to read the apartment number on willies mail box sam is thrilled
way to go carl
carl climbs the stairs two at a time and approaches willies door
he bangs on it loudly
opens a crack as willie peers out
carl pushes it hard and it opens the rest of the way
willie steps back
carl whatre you doin here
sam freezes as willie addresses carl by name
he can barely move
scared in over his head whove you been talking to
what the hell do you mean
whats going on
some woman knows all about you
the murder everything
wheres she getting it from huh
what the hell are you talking about
i havent said a word
sam is staggered
his body is shaking
she knows your name goddamn it
she knows where you live
a lot of women know where i live
carl is fuming
this isnt a joke man
you find that bitch whoever she is and
get rid of her you hear me
ive got four million dollars stuck in that fucking computer
if i dont get those codes if that moneys not transferred soon im dead
if i lose balistraris money were both dead
tell him you only wash dirty money on the first of the month
what is wrong with you
is everything a joke
you were supposed to steal his wallet
you werent supposed to kill him
was that a joke
casually i did you a favor
sickened these are drug dealers man
pause dont blow this for me willie
ive risked my job here
i could go to jail
a hundred thousand of that money goes to me
now give me sams key
ill get that address book myself
willie goes to the desk drawer and takes out sams key
sam unable to control himself explodes in a fit of rage
hauling back he slugs carl with all his might
his fist has no impact
you killed me carl
you had me killed
look what youve done to me
look what youve done
carl is on the street heading back to his car
sam is beside him yelling right into his face
he is screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs but carl doesnt hear him
you mother fucker
i had a life goddamn you
i had a life
from the distance we see sam smashing into carl
it is like hitting the air
for all of his rage and bluster there is nothing he can do
molly neatly dressed exits her building and hails a cab
she hops inside
seconds later she hops out again yelling
you white fascist bigot
who do you think you are
bed stuys part of new york you know
this is america
the driver speeds off
molly gives him the finger
molly exits a subway station and walks toward st street
she is the only white woman on the block and heads turn as she passes
hey snow you lost or sumpin
molly pays no attention
children run up to her stare and run away
when molly turns down st street the crowds disperse and she is all alone
there is a sense of menace in the air
a group of young men sitting on a stoop watches as she walks by
one of them whistles
molly keeps walking
molly sees willies building
she walks into the dank lobby
it is dark and full of shadows
leaning close she examines the mail boxes
willies name is there
she backs away afraid
a dresser drawer opens and a box labeled sams things valuable is slowly pulled out
a hand reaches inside it and extracts sams address book
as the camera pulls back we see that it is carl standing in molly and sams livingroom
carl opens the book and quickly jots down a series of code numbers he finds in the back
his eyes sparkle with excitement
molly is sitting in a room opposite detective sergeant thomas beiderman and sergeant dorothy wallace
both officers are staring at her as she speaks
she seems very uncomfortable
look youve gotta believe me
i dont even believe this stuff myself
but this is real
do you think id come here if it wasnt real
you told me to come if i had any new information
well here i am
the officers dont respond
continuing dont look at me like that
you guys use psychics all the time
there is dead silence
continuing damn it
i know how this sounds
i hear myself saying it and i want to cringe
but this woman knew things she couldnt have known intimate details
things sam only said to me
smirking okay let me get this straight
according to this psychic lady there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time huh
she stands up im sorry
ive got important things to do
she leaves the room
molly gives her a dirty look and turns to beiderman
im telling you
the killers name is willie lopez
ive got his address
youve got to check it out
beiderman gets up and looks over to molly
you just wait here
let me see if this guys got a record
he heads out of the room
molly sits back with an air of enormous relief and gratitude
sergeant wallace comes into the room again and picks up a folder
molly waits nervously
after a moment sergeant beiderman returns with a police file in his hands
molly looks up at him and then smiles at wallace as she sees it
she feels vindicated
he lays the thick folder on the desk and opens it up
she hurries over to him
and reams of police paperwork
widen as molly stares at it all in sudden shock
what are you doing
wheres your file on willie lopez
theres no file for a willie lopez
he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with
this psychic womans record goes back a long way
fraud numbers rackets you name it
shes a real pro
cut back and forth between the records and mollys stunned reaction
we see recent photos of oda mae and others going back to her youth
they are fascinating and revealing

it goes on and on
molly is overwhelmed by the evidence
continuing this womans a charlatan
you cant believe anything she said
this isnt possible
there were words private things
how could she have known all that
they have ways
theyve got a million cons
a lot of times they read the obits
all she had to do was see the word banker
hell they even go through your garbage to find things they can use letters old papers
they dont need much
molly turns away
continuing i bet you threw stuff out huh
it could have been anything
what about that underwear she knew all about
mollys eyes widen
continuing green underwear
ill bet she zeroed right in on that
she was real
she said things
she knew about a sweater i knitted about songs we sang
she knew about this place we went montego bay
molly begins to cry
i know this is hard
people want so much to believe
theyre grieving vulnerable
theyd give anything for one last moment
money insurance policies
believe me these people know what theyre doing
look i know how you must feel
you know you can press charges
molly shakes her head no
beiderman closes the file
molly sits for a long time
she is in terrible pain
oh god i wanted it to be sam
beiderman nods his head compassionately and then turns away
molly is sitting in her bedroom
the glow of the late afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed
she seems deeply depressed and alone
gradually her gaze falls on a jar sitting on the nightstand
in it is the penny sam found when they were first working on the loft
a label on the jar says for luck
in a moment of sudden rage she picks it up and throws it against the wall
it shatters on the floor
the code from sams address book jotted on a piece of paper is sitting beside carl
excitedly god let this be it
anxiously carl punches the code into a computer and suddenly sams old accounts appear on the screen
a look of relief wafts across carls face
continuing oh god yes
carl is staring at the same accounts sam was examining the afternoon before he was killed the accounts with too much money in them
carl picks up the phone and punches a number
continuing tony this is carl
im all set
just tell me what you want me to do
a voice on the other end begins to speak
we want you to transfer the money from the separate accounts into a single account under the name rita miller
tomorrow at five minutes before closing p
transfer the full account to first island bank of nassau registry number
carl writes it all down
continuing call us when its done
balistrari there wont be any problems
ill do that
carl hangs up
he seems deeply relieved
he is standing in front of carl watching
quickly carl begins punching commands into the computer
he is setting up the dummy account
molly in a short terrycloth robe is sitting in a chair
a magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the loft
she seems lost in the vast space
sam is pacing back and forth
there is a melancholy look in his eyes
why cant you hear me molly
i need you
suddenly the bell rings
mollys finger is on the intercom
she seems unsettled
molly its carl
can i come up
molly is surprised
she hesitates a moment and then pushes the buzzer to let him in
we hear carl bounding up the stairs
dont open it
hes a murderer moll
there is a knock
molly opens the door
carl seems buoyant almost celebratory
he has a bag of fruit in his hand
he is still in a suit and tie
i know its late
im sorry to disturb you
i felt bad about last night
this supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable
i dont even read horoscopes
no its not
you needed me to hear you and i didnt and that was wrong
i want you to know that im your friend moll
you were never our friend
holding out a paper bag hey i brought you some japanese apple pears
i know you like them
taking the bag oh thats so sweet
listen can i come in for a minute
i wont stay long
ive had one of those days
maybe a cup of coffee
dont do it
dont let him in
carl in shirt sleeves and molly in her robe are sitting on the couch drinking coffee
we notice that carl is wearing yellow suspenders
sam is beside himself watching them
are you alright
you look nervous upset
glancing at her thighs what can i tell you
its been tough
hell you know
it still hurts so much
he poses sadly then on top of it all
its the responsibilities
theyve given me my own accounts but ive had no time to adjust
my mind has been reeling
molly reaches out and pats his arm
there is an awkward pause
continuing where were you this morning
i thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers
i didnt have time
beat i went to the police carl
sam looks at her amazed
carl on the other hand stiffens
he laughs nervously
you really did it
i dont believe
what did you tell them
what did they say
you were right you know
i felt like such a fool
they brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick
it was awful
relieved a ripoff artist huh
shocked molly no
the sad part is that i believed her
i believed her carl
pause it was all a sham
relaxing sometimes we need to believe
i was a fool
i dont believe anything anymore
why would people do such things
sam is devastated
milking it its hard to face reality moll the hard cold facts of it
what you have to remember is the love you felt
thats whats real
you have to remember how good sam was
how much he loved you
molly holds back tears
carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair
continuing you were everything to him molly
you were his life
finally crying i feel so alone
youre not alone
youve got so much talent
youre fantastically gorgeous
appreciating his words oh god i dont know whats real anymore
i dont know what to think
just think about sam
think about what he meant to you the years you had together how wonderful they were
carl glides his hand slowly lovingly across her cheek
continuing let your feelings out
almost imperceptibly his hand moves down to the nape of her neck
as she moves her robe opens slightly
carl notices glimpsing her nakedness beneath it
sam notices too
continuing life turns on a dime moll
people think they have forever that theyll always have tomorrow
but its not true
sam taught us that
we have to live for now for today
molly can barely contain her tears
carl moves toward her moist cheeks and kisses them gently
slowly he guides his lips to her neck and kisses it too
it is all hateful and sensual at the same time
sam turns away
molly feels carls tenderness needs it
she does not notice his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling it toward him
with a little tug the cord unravels and the robe falls open
molly is confused aroused not sure what to do
she starts to pull it closed
he holds her hand
for a moment they do nothing
then his fingers reach for her thigh
her body quivers
carl feels her openness and pulls closer his hand rising gently up her naked body
mollys eyes close
she says nothing
sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing uncontrollably at the two of them
unexpectedly his foot kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and molly thats sitting on an end table
the picture crashes to the floor the glass shattering
molly jumps up the mood suddenly broken
she sees the photo and recoils
carl reaches for her
she backs away
sam is stunned by what has happened
he jumps up and tries kicking over another picture but nothing moves
his foot goes right through it
molly looks at carl drying her tears
its too soon
youve been great carl but
i need you to leave
i need you to
i really do
she reaches out and takes his hand
continuing look what if we have dinner tomorrow night
can i interest you in that
molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head yes
sam rushes madly down a flight of stairs into a subway station
a train is just leaving
he jumps on board
sam begins quickly casing the aisles looking for something
it is not there
another train can be seen speeding past the window
sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it passing through the walls
suddenly an express train passes alongside his local
sam sticks his face inside it
suddenly he smiles and rushes onto it
sam does not have to stand there long
within seconds the terrifying ghost he had seen before comes charging at him
we notice him more clearly now
he is wearing a dark blue pea coat
there is a grizzled look about him
he has stained teeth and seems perpetually unshaven
get off my train
this time sam does not back away
he holds his ground
the ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal
posters come flying off the walls
a bag of groceries topples from a womans arms an old mans cane flies across the aisle a boys mets cap flips off his head
people on the train move quickly to other cars
unable to frighten him the ghost kicks sam in the stomach
sam recoils feeling it but gets back up again
he is angry now
he begins raging at the other ghost
the ghost is shocked
teach me how you do that
i want to learn
im not leaving til you teach me
the ghost exhausted looks up at him and smiles with appreciation
you stubborn asshole
sam nods in agreement
sitting in the corner of a deserted subway station
sam is trying desperately to push a bottle cap with his finger
continuing what are you doing
what are you doing
you cant push it with your finger
the ghost demonstrates kicking a garbage pail onto its side
sam cant quite tell how he did it
i dont get it
its your mind you idiot
its all in the mind
the problem is you think youre still real that youre standin on the floor that youre wearin those clothes
you dont even have a body anymore
its all up here
you wanna move things you gotta use your mind
you gotta focus
you hear what im saying
how do you focus
i dont know how you focus
you just focus
with surprising energy the ghost flicks a bottle cap and sends it shooting across the subway platform
continuing its all in the anger
you gotta direct it
you gotta channel it
im angry all the time
it doesnt do a thing
cause youre angry all over
you gotta be angry here in the pit of your stomach
bring it down here
let it explode
he makes an explosive gesture its like a reactor you know
he kicks a coke can toward sam
sam tries to kick it back and misses
the ghost laughs
sam gets angry
he tries again and falls on his head
the ghost laughs louder
now sam is really angry
we see him forcing the anger down into his stomach
he holds still for a moment and then kicks at the can with all his might
to his shock and amazement it sails right through the ghosts head
the ghost smiles
i did it
way to go
he smashes at an abandoned tennis shoe with his fist
from your gut
what do i keep tellin you
sams stomach bulges
he tries again
continuing give it time
what else have you got
undaunted sam tries once more
this time the tennis shoe moves
the ghost nods his head approvingly
sam is thrilled
how long have you been here
since they pushed me
someone pushed you
yeah someone pushed me
you dont believe me
you think i fell
you think i jumped
well fuck you
an unexpected rage starts to build it wasnt my time
i wasnt supposed to go
im not supposed to be here
venom spews from the ghosts mouth
suddenly he rams a cigarette machine full force with his head
the glass shatters and packs of cigarettes scatter everywhere
he throws himself on top of them with terrible longing
continuing id give everything for a drag
just one drag
he rolls and wallows in terrible frustration tossing the cigarettes in all directions
suddenly he looks up and sees sam
he is unable to control his fury
continuing who the hell are you
why are you hounding me like this
leave me alone
is shooting through the station
the ghost throws himself into it and in an instant he is gone
sam all alone walks through the station
suddenly he reaches out and pushes a garbage can lid
it swings back and forth
he is delighted
a beer can is sitting on a bench
he pushes it off watching it roll across the platform with childlike glee
looking up sam sees an advertisement for market security bank and trust
he stares at it with great interest
special banking for special people
we make it easy for you
something registers in sams eyes
he yells and jumps straight up hitting a subway sign with his finger
with great excitement he runs for the stairs and rushes from the station
ortisha jones a black woman with brassy red hair is sitting at oda maes seance table surrounded by several of her relatives
clara and louise stand behind oda mae helping with the ritual
oda mae goes into her trance
a group of ghosts is milling behind oda mae
sam comes barging into the room and looks at them in amazement
what the hell
oda mae startled jumps up in her chair
everyone else jumps too
clara and louise look worried
what is all this

whatd you do tell every spook in town about me

ortisha and her relatives look up confused

ortisha looks at oda mae
she has no idea whats going on

continuing to sam so are you gonna leave or not
ive got work to do
ortisha is totally confused
oda mae turns back to her
continuing whats a matter
youre supposed to be concentrating
how do you expect me to do this if youre not concentrating
lets do it
oda mae and everyone in the room gets very quiet
one of the ghosts draws close
oda maes eyes roll up into her head
then suddenly an extraordinary thing occurs
we see the spirit pull back and dive right into oda mae
oda mae gulps
her nostrils flare
her eyes bulge
whatcha doin to me
oda maes body goes into bizarre convulsions as the ghost tries to move inside her
she looks strangely stuffed and enormously uncomfortable
sam and the others watch in astonishment as she tries to speak but nothing comes out
then suddenly the ghost speaks through oda mae
ortisha and her relatives jump up in amazement
is that you
disoriented ortisha where are you
i cant see too good
in front of you
im right here
orlando suddenly zeros in on ortisha
his eyes widen
mother of god whatve you done to your hair
ortisha smiles excitedly
orlando do you like it
its autumn sunrise
suddenly oda maes body begins to shake wildly and her voice booms out screaming with all her might
get out of here you little shit
with frightening speed she sends the spirit catapulting out of her body
clara and louise jump up
oda mae is shaking
continuing lord oh lord dont you ever do that to me
he is lying on the floor exhausted
what happened to me
i can barely move
you should know better than to try that
its not worth it

that was incredible oda mae
he spoke through you
it was amazing
no more uh uh no more
what happened to orlando
whered he leave the insurance policy
youre great oda mae
youre a real medium
its what you were born for
i want everybody out
ortisha looks around the room befuddled
clara and louise arent sure what to do
ortisha and her relatives scurry out fast
the ghosts too begin passing through the wall
oda mae lays her head on the table
suddenly her whole body begins heaving
she is starting to cry
sam is surprised
oda mae whats wrong
i said out
that means you too
sam hesitates a moment and then respectfully follows the others through the wall
clara knocks on the seance room door and peeks in
oda mae theres a man here who says he has to see you right away
i aint seein nobody
willie pushes his way into the room
clara isnt sure what to do
oda mae looks up
she does not know him
are you the one that can talk to the dead
i beg your pardon
im not seeing customers right now
i said i need to know if youre the one
im the one
but not now
this is important
i have a friend
he died recently
some say he was mugged
i think he was murdered
oda mae stares at him curiously
continuing im told you can contact people like that
is that true
its been known to happen
but its not gonna happen now so come back later
i cant wait til later
he sits down across from oda mae and shows no signs of leaving
oda mae observes him quietly for a moment
whats your friends name
why dont you tell me
oda mae glares at him
continuing youre the psychic right
this aint no guessin game
then what is it lady
lookit i dont know what your trouble is
getting nervous who are you
youre the mindreader
i hear youve been tellin people about me for days
whats my name
confused and uncomfortable
sam comes wandering back into the room
his eyes bulge
willie sits straight up in his chair amazed
howd you know that
because im psychic
with a sudden thrust oda mae sends her foot shooting into willies balls
as he recoils she knocks the table into his lap and rushes for the closet
we see her barricade herself in the hidden chamber
willie shaking scrambles to his feet and before sam can stop him blasts his gun at the closet door
it is riddled with bullets
sam screams out
willie runs to the side door and escapes to the street
clara and louise come rushing in
sam charges into the closet and sees that oda mae is safe behind the false door
then he hurries to the street
sam rushes to the sidewalk and looks in all directions
willie is nowhere to be seen
he hurries back to oda mae
the room is a disaster area full of hysterical women
oda mae is being dragged from the closet unhurt but in a state of shock
he tried to kill me
no one answers
continuing talk to me
her sisters start talking but she shoos them away
oda mae were in trouble
were in trouble
youre already dead
i can stop them
but i cant do it alone
youve gotta help me
its me theyre tryin to kill
and theyll be back
im your only chance
why dont you go find a haunted house and rattle some chains
i need you oda mae
i need you to get some fake ids
help me now theyll never bother you again
stopping thinking help you
whataya talking about exactly
what else do i have to do
oda mae dressed to the hilt is walking with sam toward the main branch of market security bank trust
she seems nervous and upset
this is crazy
this aint gonna work
i dont know nothin bout bankin
ill teach you
youll learn fast
as they reach the entrance of the bank they pass a pair of nuns collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless
one of them holds out a collection box
oda mae passes her by carefully avoiding eye contact
oda mae enters sams bank
she seems completely out of place
sam walking beside her directs her every move
see where it says new accounts
thats where youre going
paranoid im not givin em any money
just do what i say
oda mae approaches the new accounts desk
she seems very uptight
a woman officer behind the desk looks up at her
can i help you
tell her youre here to fill out a signature card for a new account
im here to fill out a signature card for a new account
and do you know your account number
tell her rita miller
eyeing her oddly didnt they have you sign a card when you opened the account
tell her carl bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today
carl bruner opened it for me
he asked me to come in today
the officer checks out the name and account number on her computer screen
it all seems to jive
she pulls out a card from her desk and hands it to oda mae
oda mae stares at it
just sign you name at the bottom on the first blank line
oda mae nods and starts to sign oda mae
sam stops her
continuing no no no
to the officer can i have another one please
i signed the wrong name
sam hits his forehead with his hand
the officer gives her another card
oda mae signs it
tell her to see that it goes right up to the third floor file since you have a transaction to make
i need you to put that in the third floor file cause i got a transfusion to make
you know what i mean
innocently umm can i keep the pen
surprised not sure what to say uh sure
oda mae delighted walks away smiling and gives the officer a wave
she is loving this
the clock on carls wall says
he seems anxious
the phone rings
he pushes down the speaker button
carl bruner speaking
carl its me john
ive got the info on the bradley portfolio
oh yeah yeah
ill pick it up later
he hangs up
his hand is shaking
sam and oda mae approach a fancy part of the bank housing administrative personnel
they approach a guard who is standing there
tell the guard youre here to see lyle furgeson
lyle furgeson please
do you have an appointment
im here for the fun of it
dont say that
tell him rita millers here
tell him rita millers here

turning around excuse me
she waves him on
whispering now listen this guy furgesons a real jerk
why are you whispering
he doesnt know just be quiet and listen
ive known him five years and he still thinks my names paul
we see the guard leaning over mr
furgeson looks up and sees oda mae
he shrugs his shoulders
continuing hes a social moron
you dont have to worry about anything
tell the guard furgeson knows you
you spent time with him and his wife shirley at the brewsters christmas party last year
the guard comes back
what is this regarding
he doesnt remember me
we were together at the brewsters christmas party
with his wife shirley
they had that lovely tree
all those presents
why ill never forget all those beautiful
sam pokes her
she yelps surprised and glances around
the guard gives her an odd look
she forces a smile
he smiles back and then goes over to mr
thisll be easy
furgeson was so drunk at that party he could have had a conversation with tina turner and he wouldnt remember
the guard whispers in furgesons ear
furgeson appears totally flummoxed
he looks up at oda mae embarrassed and waves
the guard motions her to come back
she walks proudly over to his desk
he sticks out his hand
of course of course
its been so long
a long time
ask how bobby and snooky are
how are bobby and snooky doin
perplexed why theyre just fine thank you
nice of you to ask

impressed that was a wonderful tip
good old randy
good old randy
got a real head on his shoulders
so what brings you here today
youre closing an account
im closing an account
do you have your account number
she looks up into the air
furgeson eyes her strangely
he punches rita millers number into the computer
a figure appears on the screen
he stares at it for a few seconds and then punches it in again
trying to be calm well rita youll be withdrawing four million dollars from us today is that correct
four million dollars
and how will you want that
tens and twenties
a cashiers check
tell him a cashiers check
a cashiers check
of course you realize were required to get some identification from everyone
its just procedural
oda mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a drivers license and a social security card
furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk
he seems unsteady on his feet
an officer at the next desk is using a brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk
oda mae smiles
you know if you put that brillo pad in the freezer itll last twice as long
the officer nods appreciatively
furgeson lays oda maes id next to her signature card
the signatures match up
he nods his head in approval
carl looks up at the clock
he pushes down a button on the phone
a secretary answers
get me the first island bank of nassau
its on the rolodex
furgeson returns with rita millers signature card and a cashiers check for
oda maes hand shakes as she examines it
ill just need your signature right here
sign rita miller
sam looks up and gulps
molly has just entered the bank and is heading toward them
he jumps up nervously
continuing ill be back in a minute
youre on your own
dont say anything foolish
oda mae signs a form closing the account
of course the signatures match
furgeson examines them both and smiles
he shakes oda maes hand
now you be careful with this
its like carrying cash you know
positively glowing i sure do
sam rushes over to molly
he is not sure what to do
he notices a stack of deposit forms on the counter she is about to pass
he hurries to it and flicks the entire stack a hundred sheets flying up into the air
molly confused thinks she is responsible and stoops to pick them up
sam delighted flicks another stack
oda mae is talking a blue streak when sam returns to her
continuing then my mother took all the money from the oil wells and put it in gasoline pumps
every gas station has em you know sometimes six or more
it adds up
oda mae come on
we gotta get out of here
abruptly getting up well ive got to leave
its been a pleasure doin business with you
say hi to shirley and snooky for me
thank you rita
ill be glad to
oda mae smiles and leaves
there is a new lilt in her walk
suddenly sam looks and sees molly about to stand up
hurry up oda mae
at that second oda mae spots a quarter lying on the ground
she stoops down and picks it up
excitedly what a day
molly sees her does a double take and starts to go after her
unfortunately oda mae steps onto an elevator before molly can catch up
the doors close
molly stops for a moment and then looks back across to the executive area
she sees lionel furgeson and hurries over to him
he is surprised to see her and grows instantly solicitous
how are you
lionel a woman who just left a black lady about my height did you see her
i just took care of her
what did she want
did it have anything to do with me
did she ask about sam
not understanding sam
was her name oda mae brown
no rita miller
she just closed an account
molly stares at furgeson
she is not sure what to think
continuing is there a problem
hesitating not sure what to say no
i guess not
she walks away confused
carl in front of his computer is going crazy
he keeps punching buttons on the keyboard but the same response appears over and over on the screen
account panicked carl jumps up
he moves quickly erratically around the office and then back to the computer
he punches the keys over and over
the same answer appears on the screen
the account is closed
carl runs through the office
he seems crazed
people look at him
carl is something wrong
is someone playing with the computers
is this a joke
one of my accounts is closed
he doesnt answer
continuing you want me to call someone
changing his demeanor no no
its all right
i can do it
sam and oda mae are walking down the street in front of the bank
oda mae is talking to herself
take the check out of your purse
there is a nervous look on her face
take it out
just do it
oda mae worried removes the check but holds onto it tightly
continuing now endorse it
sign rita miller
in shock endorse it
do what i say
thats blood money oda
i was killed for that money
endorse it now
what are you going to do with it
were giving it away
what do you mean
look to your left
oda mae looks at the nuns collecting money for the homeless
are you outta your mind
do what i tell you
clutching the check i cant
yes you can
if you dont do it theyll track you down
your only protection is to get rid of it now
sweet jesus youre killing me sam
im saving you oda mae
youll go to heaven for this
oda mae growls at him
with great difficulty she approaches the nuns
the nuns look at her with curiosity and compassion
with great hesitation oda mae begins to write
we sense that every word is a torment for her
the nuns politely avert their eyes from the check
bless you child
oda mae gives her a dirty look and hands the check over
im proud of you
dont you talk to me
i dont want you comin round no more
i mean it
come on were friends
she turns on her high heels and wobbles away
sam calls after her
i think youre wonderful oda mae
she growls again
in the background we see the nuns secretly peeking at the check
one of them wide eyed faints dead away
the other nun stoops down and fans her face in an attempt to revive her
it is after hours
almost everyone on the floor has gone
carl hunched over his computer is typing furious commands on the keyboard
he looks haggard and worn
sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the monitor screen
sam sitting in a desk chair watches smiling
search you bastard
youll never find it
he smiles theyll kill you for this carl
you and willie
theyll wipe you off the face of the earth
in a moment of childish delight he pushes his feet against the wall and the chair shoots across the room
carl looks up and sees an empty chair moving
he stares at it in confusion and then goes back to the screen
he seems desperate
nothing is working
panicked and frightened carl flicks off the machine and storms furiously around the room
sam approaches the computer hesitates a moment and then pushes the power switch
the computer clicks back on
carl spins around
he stares at the computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off
sam enjoying this reaches for the switch and flicks it back on again
carl stares at it
carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and letters begin appearing on the screen
he sits down mesmerized by what is happening
then his face grows tense
the word m u r d e r e r is emerging before him
carl flies out of his chair frantically running around to see who else is on the floor
he yells out like a madman
continuing whos doing that
there is no one there
he hears the computer beginning to type again and hurries back to look at the screen
one word appears
s a m
carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist
it crashes to the floor
electrical sparks go flying as carl gasps for breath
sam cannot hold himself back any longer
with a horrifying scream he charges at carl jamming his fist hard into his ribs
you goddamn bastard
carl grabs his side
he hits carl again
carl gasps in inexplicable pain
its dinner time carl
dont you have a date with molly you creepy son of a bitch
sam keeps hitting deeper into carls mid section
carl doubles over as though hes going to throw up
sam is flushed with excitement
carl kneels beside his desk
he cannot understand what is happening to him
his face goes stark white as the attack continues
then unexpectedly the assault stops
sam exhausted stares hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor
slowly and dizzily carl gets up
he looks fearfully around the office and then holding his stomach hurries from the room
molly all dressed to go out is sitting in sams easy chair asleep
suddenly carl arrives knocking at her door
he does not look well
sam is with him
where were you
i thought we were having
things just got so crazy
i completely forgot
old carl had a little trouble at the office
i was worried
is everything okay
are you all right
look can i talk to you for minute
can i come in
molly eyes carl with concern as he enters the loft
continuing i need to ask you a question
he needs to borrow four million dollars
molly i know what the police said but when you thought sam was here when you thought he spoke to you what did you feel
what did he say
very tense molly that psychic woman i want to know what she told you
i want to know what she said
carl stop this
it was all a hoax
i told you

shes a charlatan
she hesitates and stares at carl does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today
gulping at the bank
he holds up his hand as if wanting her to stop
i was sure i saw her
furgeson says she was taking out money
it turns out her name isnt even oda mae brown
its rita miller or something
carl turns white
his eyes bulge
he feels sick
continuing whats wrong

concerned she hurries from the room
sam digs his hands into carls back
carl jerks forward in intense pain and begins flailing at the air
what are you doing to me
sam does not go away
freaked carl runs into the kitchen and rushes to the stove
quickly he turns on the gas
he looks crazed
turning to the air he begins whispering loudly
you touch me again and ill set her on fire
i mean it
ill kill her
ill blow up the whole building if i have to
sam jabs at the knob on the stove and begins to turn it off
carl sees it move
shocked and frightened he grabs it and pulls it off leaving only the tiny stem in place
continuing go on try it again
let me see you turn it off now
sam frightened tries with all his might but he cannot twist it
carl pulls out a cigarette lighter and gloats
continuing try and hurt me
ill kill her if you hurt me
sam rushes at carl about to jam his full fist into his chest but then he stops afraid
he pulls back shaken
carl stands there waiting for a blow that doesnt come
he begins to gloat
whats a matter

you better believe me
i want my money
i need that money and i want it tonight at
if that psychic lady doesnt bring it here mollys dead
molly enters the kitchen
she grabs her nose
oh my god

carl acts as if thats the reason he came into the kitchen
you must have left the stove on
he fiddles with the dials and turns it off
continuing just glad i smelled it

she opens a window

molly is speechless
oda mae is watching t
with clara and louise
suddenly she jumps aware of sams presence in the room
clara and louise jump too

theyre comin to kill you

a red mustang screeches to a stop on the street below
sam and oda mae run to the window
carl and willie are looking up
theyre comin to kill me
to sam crazed what have you done
willie and carl jump out of the car
they head for oda maes building
sam steps back from the window
theyre heading for the door
terrified jesus have mercy
willie forces open a back door
they head into the building
oda mae and the others hurry into the hall
they rush down the corridor and knock loudly on a neighbors door
a woman opens it a crack
let us in
who you kiddin
the woman slams the door and locks it shut
oda mae looks frightened
carl and willie climb the stairs two at a time
oda mae and her sisters bang on another apartment door
no one is home
across the corridor an elderly woman sticks her head out to see what is going on
before she can say anything they push their way inside
whatre you doin
you cant come in here
the cat dont like visitors
shell pee all over the couch
you wanna pay for
oda mae grabs the womans mouth
just as willie and carl emerge from the stairwell
they head down the hall toward oda maes door
willie pulls out a gun and fires
the lock shoots open
they rush inside
in the elderly womans vestibule peering through the peephole
the old woman is struggling and still trying to talk
oda maes knees are wobbling
theyre gonna find us
no they wont
im gonna get em
and how you gonna do that
im a ghost arent i
willie moves quickly through oda maes apartment his gun pointed ready to fire
he seems furious when he realizes no one is there
looks like someone just left
ill check the building
he rushes back out and down the stairs
willie stays in the apartment
suddenly the doorbell rings
willie rushes over and opens the door a crack
there is no one there
confused he backs away
the doorbell rings again
completely mystified he aims his gun and opens the door all the way
the hallway is empty
as willie stands there wondering what is happening sam steps inside and pushes the door closed
it slams shut
willie nearly jumps out of his skin
he stares at the door in total bewilderment
at that instant a collection of picture frames flies off the breakfront and crashes into his legs
he backs away spooked
suddenly the t
flicks on at full volume and then the stereo and the radio
lights begin flashing on and off
willie spins around in total dismay
summoning all of his force sam slams into willie
willie recoils in unexplainable pain
he seems very disoriented
his gun falls to the floor
he reaches for it and sam pushes it away
willie jumps up afraid
his eyes dart around the room
continuing whos there
whos doing that
a pair of candle holders shoot off the mantle piece and nearly hit willie in the head
grabbing his gun willie runs into the bathroom and locks the door
suddenly the hot water faucet turns on by itself
willie is terrified
steam rises from the sink
willie tries to get out but sam approaches him from behind and appears to dig his hands into his neck
willie crumples to his knees
there is a squeaking sound and willie looks up
letters are appearing in the fogged mirror
he stares in disbelief as the word b o o
emerges before him
he cries out
continuing let me outta here
shaking uncontrollably willie fires his gun at the mirror
glass and tiles explode
willie is cut and bleeding
he grabs hold of the door and yanks it open
willie rushes to the hallway charges for the back stairs and stumbles down the three flights to the street
carl running down the corridor rushes after him
willie drops his gun
carl picks it up
willie runs from the building and careens down the sidewalk
people clear a path as he hurls past them like a madman
carl confused runs after him
sam too races after willie unwilling to let him get away
suddenly a man obstructs his way
willie goes flying over him and lands face down on the cement
before he can get up sam is all over him and does not let up
people stand back to watch as willie does battle with himself
panicked he calls out to a bystander
people back away
carl watches in terror
he understands exactly what is happening
willie blinded by his own hysteria runs wildly into the street
cars are bearing down on him from all directions
he does not get out of their way
one driver sees willie coming and swerves to avoid him
his car skids
another car brakes to avoid a collision and suddenly both cars crash right into him
willies body is crushed instantly between the two vehicles as his spirit is catapulted into the air still screaming and writhing
his ghostly form reaches out to people for help as they rush past
no one stops
willie spins around and sees a mangled body crumpled on the street
suddenly he recognizes that it is his own dead body lying there
he begins to scream
a bizarre and frightening clicking sound fills the air
sam looks up
a group of strange dark figures has emerged from the shadows
with a loud terrifying shriek the dark forms swoop down and grab hold of willie
in an instant they are dragging willie kicking and screaming down through the sewer grates into the bowels of the earth
sam backs against a wall in absolute horror
carl standing in the crowd turns and runs
oda mae and her sisters are huddling with the old woman in the entryway to her apartment
they all appear frightened
the door is opened a crack and they can see people gathering in the hall outside
sam walks up to oda mae
she feels his presence
hes dead oda mae
she utters a sigh of relief oh thank god
its not over oda mae
theres still carl
oda mae freezes
she turns to sam
sam and oda mae are in a taxi speeding downtown
tell him to hurry
cant you hurry up
listen lady im going as fast as i can
sam leans forward and pushes at the gas pedal
the cab shoots forward
the driver seems shocked
he gives her a dirty look
there is a knock at the door
molly goes to it
fastening the latch she opens it a crack
carl is that you
oda mae wedges her foot inside
molly its oda mae
i know what you think of me but your life is in danger
you have to listen to me
sams here too
you gotta let us in
molly tries to slam the door but hits oda maes foot
get the hell out of here
im calling the police
we want you to call em
youre in trouble
let us in
sams death was no accident
he was murdered molly
carl was laundering money at the bank
sam found out
he tried to kill me
hell kill you too
screaming why are you doing this to me
get away from me
i know all about you
youre a fake
youre just a fake
leave me alone
we see sams inside the room with molly
he gazes at her lovingly for a moment and then calls back to oda mae
tell her shes wearing the blouse i spilled the margarita on and the earrings i gave her for christmas
sam says youre wearin the blouse he spilled the margarita on and the earrings he gave you at christmas
grabbing hold of her beads
her hand is shaking
continuing see im no fake
gimme a penny quick
empty your purse
on the floor
oda mae obeys
a pile of coins falls on the floor
continuing push a penny under the door
oda mae obeys and a penny slides into the loft
molly sees it
sam tips it carefully so it lands upright against the bottom of the door
pushing gently he moves the penny up the door until its eye level with molly
she watches it amazed
then to her astonishment the penny floats away from the door and hovers in the air
there is a look of wonder in mollys eyes as it floats toward her
continuing calling to oda mae tell her its for luck
sam says its for luck
molly stands there dumbfounded
her face is completely white
after a moment she reaches for the penny
it falls into her hand
there are tears in her eyes
oda mae standing in the hallway as the door to the loft begins to open
slowly molly steps out onto the landing and stares at her nervously uncomprehendingly
she hesitates for a long moment and then invites oda mae in
molly is on the phone
oda mae is beside her
yes its right on the corner
were a red brick building with the entrance on the left side
thank you sergeant
well be waiting right here
she hangs up police are on their way
oda mae takes her and leads her to the couch
what do we do now
there is a period of awkward silence
is sam here
im sitting beside you
pointing right here
molly reaches out tentatively
sam meets her hand
she flinches for a second but does not pull back
fingering the air can you feel me sam
with all my heart
with all his heart he says
id give anything to be alive again just to feel you once more
he wishes he could touch you just one more time
oda mae looks away uncomfortably
the camera holds on her face
after a moment she turns around and addresses the air
okay damn it you can use me if you want
sam looks oddly at oda mae
continuing come on
before i change my mind
suddenly he understands what she means
sams finger presses down two keys
we see a record slide out of its slot and move toward the turntable
we know what it is going to play
oda mae closes her eyes
unchained melody begins to play
sam hesitates for a moment and then cautiously awkwardly slides his ghostly body into her solid form
we sense oda maes discomfort gradually give way as sam emerges inside her
after a second her body turns slowly toward molly
oda maes hand reaches out and with slow deliberate gestures touches mollys hand
molly swallows hard
she closes her eyes
it is as though he alone is there with molly
his eyes are full of tears
he can barely move
his hand glides slowly down mollys cheek
he seems to be in a state of ecstasy and pain
the experience is more than he can bear
he pulls back
molly reaches out takes sams hand and guides it to her soft lips
sam can barely breathe
he seems totally absorbed in the experience the sensation of human flesh
his eyes are absolutely still and full of light
he seems to be glowing
gently molly takes sams arm and guides him to his feet
effortlessly she draws him to the center of the huge loft
with great tenderness she puts her arms around him and before he knows what is happening they are dancing
it is a strange touching image reminiscent of their first night in their new home
sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down over her face caressing her forehead her cheeks her lips
she stands motionless
her face shines
she knows beyond all doubt that it is him
i love you so much
a loud jarring sound
it takes a moment to realize that it is someone knocking at the door
the light slams back into its shadowy substance and sam comes shooting back into his ghostly form
oda mae is standing with molly in the center of the room
sam is beside them
he appears shaken and dizzy
there is a another loud pounding at the door
molly heads for the door
sam calls out
he can barely speak
to molly wait
sam tries to go instead
to his amazement and ours he is extremely weak barely able to move
whats happening to me
his ghostly functions are diminishing
there is another knock and a voice rings out
molly open up
get out of here
the fire escape
oda mae grabs molly
come with me
oda mae and molly run for the fire escape window
we hear carl yelling in the hallway
are you there
carl is standing on the landing
he is holding a gun
he aims it at the lock and fires
the door to the loft flies open
carl moves rapidly through the huge space
it is obvious that no ones home
sam with great effort rushes at carl and attacks him with his fists
to his great shock he has no impact
carl walks right through him
molly and oda mae are climbing the fire escape
carl runs to the fire escape window
he looks out just in time to see oda mae go into the th story window
molly and oda mae run through a new loft that is under construction
it is a maze of tangled wires and broken walls
the fire escape window slams shut and nearly scares them half to death
they rush blindly toward the front door
it wont open
back to the fire escape
head for the roof
oda mae reaches the fire escape window just as carl appears on the other side
carl tries shoving the window open
it wont budge
molly sees some scaffolding leading to the skylight
there is an opening at the top
molly quickly climbs the scaffolding and makes it to the roof
with a huge shove carl opens the window and rushes inside
the window slams behind him
oda mae rushes back toward molly but her foot catches on a loose cable and she falls to the ground
help us sam
a hand falls on oda maes shoulder
she spins around
carl is standing behind her
she screams as he knocks her to the floor
i want the check
just give me the check
molly looks down from the scaffolding and begins to scream
screaming god almighty carl
what are you doing
what have you done
she descends quickly and runs toward carl
shes a thief
its not her money
carl kicks oda mae
molly rushes at him attacking him violently
carl aims his gun at her
continuing keep out of this molly
he grabs oda mae by the hair
continuing where is it
oda mae cries out
in my purse
she points across the room
carl sees the purse and yanks oda mae toward it
yanking it off the floor he tears through it like a wild man
there is no check
he grabs oda mae
where is it goddamn it
where is it
i gave it away
dont lie to me
he aims his gun at her eye and is about to fire when suddenly something shoves him to the floor
carl screams and jumps back tripping over oda mae
sam is standing there
in total panic carl scrambles to get up
horrified he shoots his gun blindly into the air
molly and oda mae dive for cover
the bullets have no impact
sam musters all his strength and shoves carl again
white with fear carl grabs molly and aims his gun at her head
continuing ill kill her
you touch me and ill kill her
i mean it sam
just give me the check
the gun is cocked at her temple
no one moves
slowly the camera dollies toward carl
continuing sam please
i didnt mean for him to kill you
its not my fault
come on sam give me the check
give it to me and ill leave her alone
carl looks nervous
in a wild explosive fury sam charges at carl and smashes at his gun
the weapon flies out of carls hand
empowered by an anger we have not seen before sam smashes into carl with a violent force
carls body careens into walls and floorboards
two by fours crack
carl crawling desperately to escape sees his gun on the floor
with a wild rush he grabs for it and shoots at the door
the lock explodes and the door flies open
carl tries to run for it but sam cuts in front of him
with growing power sam sends carl flying back into the apartment colliding into a tall scaffold
bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air
the apartment looks like a scene from another world
carl in a state of total unrelieved panic breaks away from sam
the dust obscures his escape
like a trapped insect he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window
sam cannot see him
carl shoves at the window
it is stuck
with a supreme effort he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass
half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing the window
shards of glass fly in all directions
sam turns and sees carl
he surges after him but knows he cannot get to him in time
carl is halfway out the window when sams fist slams into an electrical box attached to a dangling bx cable
it goes flying toward the window
to his amazement it hits the frame
a huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down
carl looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his chest
before he can move it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart
his body quivers
carls eyes bulge from their sockets
his body begins to spasm
he cant get up
a look of abject terror flashes through his eyes
he tries to scream
there is no sound
he tries to breathe
there is no breath
with one last effort carl lurches forward
to his amazement his body stands up and pulls away from the window
he looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone
there is no blood
excited and confused he turns around and sees sam
for a moment he cannot comprehend what is happening
there is a strange silent moment between them
then seemingly out of nowhere a terrible clicking sound is heard
frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness
carl looks behind him and gasps
past the figures coming toward him he sees his own dead body
it is pinned to the window sill
before carl can cry out the dark figures swoop down and envelope him
in a flash his spirit is caught and surges with the dark forces back into the shadows
far in some invisible distance we can barely hear him scream
and then it is silent
it is over
molly is crouched in the corner her back pressed tightly against the wall
she is staring into space
the room is filled with plaster dust
slowly emerging from the dust we see sam approaching molly
he gazes at her with terrible longing
suddenly a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze
sam turns to look at it
his eyes are full of surprise and wonder
the spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him
as he looks down he notices that his hands are growing transparent
his body is beginning to fade
a faint smile forms on his face
he leans down toward molly staring at her for a long silent moment
mollys head lifts up
she looks around
is that you
i hear you sam
she starts to cry
gradually we notice that the dust in the air near molly is beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow
to her astonishment sams spirit is reflected in the floating particles
continuing oh god
sams luminous form appears before her
molly is overwhelmed by the sight of him
the two of them gaze at one another without moving
they know it is for the last time
it is a silent exchange charged with emotion
slowly the two bodies reach forward
as their lips touch the plaster dust swirls sensuously through sams vaporous image and he begins to disappear
molly pulls back from him as though from a cloud
his voice rises from the mist
i cant stay anymore
tears roll down her cheek
the brilliant light intensifies
it is beautiful like a sunrise saturating the room with a warm comforting glow
molly looks up and sees it all
oda mae sees it too
theyre waiting for you sam
smiling i know
goodbye oda mae
with deep felt gratitude thank you
your mama would be proud
oda mae smiles warmly
sam turns to molly
she is gazing at the last remaining moments of him
her eyes brim over with tears and love
i love you molly
ive always loved you
molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes
the light inside sam intensifies
a sweet smile emerges on his lips
its so amazing moll
his face fills with joy
continuing the love inside
he whispers almost crying
continuing you take it with you
they are his last words
his spirit dissolves within its ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate
molly looks up silently for a moment her face filled with love
we see sams spirit rise from the room
it passes effortlessly through the ceiling and in seconds he is gone
the room grows dark
molly sits quietly on the floor
there is a look of awe and wonder in her eyes
after a moment oda mae reaches down to help her up
molly looks at her lovingly and then gently takes her hand
arm in arm supporting one another they walk quietly from the room
