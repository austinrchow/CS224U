u turn shooting draft revised by richard rutowski oliver stone u turn stray dogs screenplay by john ridley and richard rutowski oliver stone it is early morning and already hot
insects drone crackle and scurry for shade
prairie dogs burrow to escape the sun
we can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the earth
on a dusty highway a pair of vultures dine on a dead coyote
one of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass
in the distance where a long dusty road meets the horizon a small shape appears a sixty four and a half mustang convertible its top down
its candy apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun
as the car drifts closer we see steam escaping from under the hood
sammi smiths please help me get through the night plays on the cars radio
at the wheel ignoring impending disaster bobby cooper young good looking fiddles with the radio dial annoyed only to find country stations
hes been driving since noon yesterday and it shows along with a heavily bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel
he finds something by pearl jam or smashing pumpkins and he cranks it
he pops a percodan with his good hand as in the shimmering distance ahead he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn
get off the goddamn road
as the mustang powers by the vultures move off the shoulder silently watching
the radio blares as bobby fights to stay awake
his attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane
he sits up as the police car sheriff potter inside closes quickly
the siren starts faintly then screams as the cruiser roars past at speed
there is a loud pop from the front of the mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood
the temperature gauge now starts rising
a couple of semis roar past in the opposite direction buffetting the mustang with their air waves
the car rolls into a fork in the road limping with the droop of an animal that wont make another hundred yards
one sign on the larger road says globe is miles away
the other sign on the lesser road tells us superior is only miles
a third sign confirms his destiny with gas food mile
bobby seems to have no choice
he aims the car down the lesser road towards superior arizona
the car rattles on its last legs as bobby mutters incantations noticing a old ghostlike mining company at the base of the mountains overlooking the town
its deserted now no one visible the gates shut but in its vast dark bulk we sense the ancient richness and power of this town
bobby moves on
down the road from the mining company bobbys car pulls into a small gas station made of weather beaten wood its windows long since dusted over
the pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties
above the station is a sign so faded its barely readable harlins
bobby gets out of the car and with great care favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain he opens the hood
a plume of steam hits him in the face
bobby looks around for someone anyone
after a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn
he waits then blows it again
from out of the station walks darrell a slow looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty
he looks the part of a yokel
hes up at the look out
darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance
will he be back soon
the look outs a cemetery
you own this place
then why do you call it harlins
cause harlin used to own it
but hes dead
bobby is confused but chooses to drop the matter
you want to take a look at my car
i think the radiator hose is damn
gonna be another hot one today
sometimes i dont even want to get out of bed
course dont want to get out for the cold ones neither
then of course the clouds come in
darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag
it doesnt so much wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt
look harlin ive got places to be
could you just take a look at my radiator hose
darrell is clearly upset at being cut off
he leans into the car and looks at the engine
its your radiator hose
i know its busted
what did i just tell you
well you know so much why dont you just fix it yourself
if i could do you think id be standing here wasting my time
can you fix it or do i have to go somewhere else
mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here
only other gas station down in town closed years ago when the mine got shut
okay im stuck
now can you fix it or not
yeah i can fix it
gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one or close enough
gonna take time
how much time
bobby rewinds his watch what time is it now
twenty after ten
twenty after ten and it must be ninety already
course half hour from now might be seventy two
these clouds move around a lot
bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead
what happened to your hand
self consciously bobby quickly drops his hand to his side
you got to be more careful
hands is important
let me show you something
when i was a kid now i dont know if you can still see it but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower
im very interested in this but is there someplace
diner up a piece
not much but us simple folk like it
ill be back in a couple of hours
and be careful with her will you
darrell slams down the hood
just a car
bobby reaches into the car pulls out a small ugly gym bag which he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk pops it open
its not just a car
its a sixty four and half mustang convertible
thats the difference between you and me and why you live here and im just passing through
the trunk lid rises in the air partially blocking bobby from darrell acting as a partition between them
now do you mind
i got to get some stuff out of the trunk
he throws the car key to darrell who takes the hint spits grotesquely into the dirt scratches his nuts and walks back to the shack
concealed by the trunk lid bobby pulls out a gun a
mm black baretta wrapped in a t shirt from the top of the bag
perhaps we see a flash of green money lots of it
sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside
with a look around bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk
briefly we notice a towing rope under the mat
there is a small travel bag from which he peels a fresh bottle of percodan quickly taking two as well as the sports page
darrell watches out of the darkened office through the front window as bobby slams the trunk and starts walking down the road with the bag on his shoulder
bobby walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign saying superior home of the golden door retirement community
as he walks on a pair of motorcyclers roar past on their harleys blanketing him in a cloud of dust
he shouts after them but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle engines
bobby hits town such as it is the freeway left here a few years back
there are only a few little stores a general store a catalog outlet a post office that doubles as a bus depot
all of them built for the desert heat
the busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop diner with a few wheelers parked outside it
at the corner of one street sits an old blind man dressed in raggedy clothes perhaps an indian
his seeing eye dog lies next to him
hes talking to two old men veterans perhaps indian or spanish
they both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as bobby passes
the blind man yells out in an american indian accent
you want something old man
dont call me old man
aint you got no respect boy
you want something
yeah i want something
i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop
you cant do that yourself
hell no i cant do that myself
cant you see that
im sorry i didnt whatd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on
i dont know
i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes
i aint got no eyes
you want to see
lost my eyes in vyee et nam
lost them fighting the commies
fought the war and lost my eyes fightin the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me
i said i was sorry
dont be sorry
just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst
you got change
you want my change
i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change
all right old man
bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine it has bottles instead of cans
the blind man shouts to bobby
get me a dr
i dont want no colas
colas aint nothing but flavored water
bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of dr
he starts back to the blind man
dont forget to open it for me
i cant be opening my own bottle
bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground
a little for mother earth
im about fifty percent indian you know
to all our relations
he takes a hearty swig of the soda
just what i needed
the blind man holds the bottle out to bobby
a string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottles neck
bobby reaches down and pets the old mans dog
flies buzz around both the dog and the blind man
i think youd better give your pooch a sip
he looks sick
thats cause hes dead
bobby jumps back
i hope you wasnt pettin him none was you
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for
hes only just dead
what was i supposed to do with him
i cant take him away anywhere
and nobody wants to take him for me
aint nothing i can do but keep him here beside me
thats where he belongs anyways
me and jesse thats my dog not anymore but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes
he was just a pup then
a companion thats loyal thatll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him
i miss him
as bobby moves away ill see ya later unless i come across something worse
bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street grace mckenna compulsively turns and catches up to her
she is dressed better than the usual t shirts and tank tops of this town perhaps a mail ordered dress or a mothers hand me down
with her raven hair and caramel skin it is obvious she is native american
her arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage
can i give you a hand beautiful
im just going to my car
thats right on my way
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers
my name is bobby
now im not a stranger anymore
see how easy it is for us to get to know each other beautiful
do you have to call me that
i dont know your real name
maybe i dont want you to
grace stops walking
maybe but if you didnt i think you would have kept on walking
youre pretty full of yourself arent you
i like that about me beautiful
may i carry your package grace
grace hesitates then gives the package to bobby
he has trouble with it himself
you sure you can manage
i got it
do you want me to carry your pack for you
bobby blurts out emphatically
he catches himself and softens a bit
no ive got it
what happened to your hand
you should be more careful
they start walking towards graces car
its very nice of you to help me
that package is kind of heavy and its so hot
no trouble at all really
they get to a car and bobby puts down the package
oh this isnt my car
its down a ways
i should have parked closer
i just didnt think it would be so heavy
i could drive up
thats all right
i got it
bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again
the package seems to have gained weight
its just new drapes and curtain rods
if i had known it was going to be so heavy i would have had them delivered up to the house
bobby struggles with the package
sweat starts to sheet his face
bobby panting that a fact
i just got tired of looking at the old drapes
my mother made them
had them long as i can remember
you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it
bobby straining yes i have
course they cost a little more than i should really be spending
but damn it i dont hardly ever do anything nice for myself
i deserve nice things
bobby can hardly talk i
they arrive at a jeep sahara
this is it
bobby practically drops the package
he is covered with sweat
thank you bobby
youre welcome grace
youre not from around here are you
why you say that
just because i help a lady with her package
you dont have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day
i just drove in this morning
drove into superior
didnt have a choice
my car overheated up the road
youre lucky you didnt break down in the desert
day like today youd be dead in no time
when you leaving
not until my cars fixed
i dont know how long thats going to take
and here ive made you all hot and sweaty
grace steps to bobby and places her hand against his chest
she rubs away some of the sweat
they look at each other a beat
a police car seen earlier pulls up beside them from behind and idles
sheriff virgil potter is a weathered handsome middle aged man with suspicious eyes black haired in contrast to bobbys sandiness
got my drapes
well its about time
looks like you found yourself a helper too
bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes
well he offered and i just couldnt refuse
his car overheated
bobby turns to the sheriff and forces a smile
beat to grace little excitement out at the reservation this morning
wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun
bia handled it
i went by for backup
that wayne cant shoot when hes sober much less drunk
hes lucky he didnt kill his own danged self
beat well anyhow you stay cool
nice meeting you son
same here officer
the sheriff drives on
they look at each other
well i guess i could use some help getting this box into the house
you could shower get something cool to drink
bobby considers the offer but theres not much considering to do
well i could use something cool
bobby rides along with grace in her jeep
where you coming from
chicago houston detroit
just lately dallas
youve been around
i guess ive got wander in my blood
where you headed
i dont know
i have to make a stop in vegas
business to finish
then maybe ill head to santa barbara
i might be able to pick up some action there
so what is it you do mister
oh you know whatever pays best
little bartending used to teach tennis played a little competition
i never played tennis
you just travel around bobby no direction no steady work
you must like taking chances
if youre going to gamble might as well play for high stakes
what happens when you lose
i pack up and go somewhere else
grace wistfully somewhere else
ive never been anywhere else
went to the state fair
it was nice but it wasnt nothing
i couldnt stay in this place
id just pick up do whatever i had to do and get out
grace looks to bobby and smiles
sometimes i feel the exact same way
bobby naked steps into the shower and turns on the water
it shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body
as the water falls over him we hear a russian accented voice i want my money
bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself
his hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his pinky or ring finger
bobby leans back in the shower
just as he does it is raining hard
matching the backwards motion of the last scene bobby is thrown violently against a brick wall facing out
i want my money
look ill get the money
you dont want to do this
take two for now
one a week punk
bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular goons
another man stands partially hidden behind the goons frame
with one hand one goon flattens bobbys hand against the brick with his other he clips two fingers off with a garden shear
we see bobbys face in agonizing pain then he slides screaming to the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men
as bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen blank face
we see bobbys face reliving the experience as once again we hear the voice
two weeks asshole
get the money or you gonna lose your nose and ears
bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower looking to his left hand almost crying unable to tolerate it
as a streak of blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring fingers have been cut off at the joints
bobby his hand rebandaged is putting on his clothes
bobby to himself youre still lucky
as he does he looks at himself in the mirror
he bends to pick up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag
as he lifts it we can see perhaps more closely than at the garage that the bag is filled with money
he closes the bag and stands
in the mirror hidden in the doorway he sees grace watching him
bobby slows perceptibly but does not try to hide himself
after a moment grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade
thought you might like a refill on your lemonade
bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down
he rubs the glass against his forehead
cools you right off
tentatively i saw you watching me
i didnt mean to
i didnt say it bothered me
did you like it me watching you
ive got an ego same as any man
good cause i liked what i saw
bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant
grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips
he notices a framed picture of grace and an older man
grace sits on the edge of the bed
bobby indicates the picture ironic
whos that your father
grace without much thought stepfather
bobby coy got a boyfriend
bobby senses shes lying but plays along
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house
i guess it must
what do you do anyway
a little of this a little of that
mostly i tell fortunes
whered you learn to do that
from my father
he was the tribes shaman
a medicine man
those are white words not ours
nice house for a shamans daughter
you must be good
bobby goes to grace and kneels before her
she takes his head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes
her voice goes thick but soft like a morning fog
theres something in your past something you want to keep hidden
theres a pain
someone you cant forget
and there is something you want very badly
it seems very far away to you but you are determined and you will do what you must to get it
bobby closes his hands on graces and takes them from his face
he is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of graces reading
my face tell you all that
it tells me what every face tells me
everybody has a past they have a pain and they have something they want
seductively what is it you want
the same thing you do
they silently stare into each others eyes
i want to hang drapes
grace walks from the room
for a moment bobby stares after her
he takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his teeth
grace is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes
bobby notices a photo of grace with an older indian woman her mother
bobby stands behind her gently places his hands on graces waist
i wont break
you know girls are a lot tougher than men think
bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes
his eyes are transfixed on her ass
lift me down
lift me down
bobby lifts grace down from the ladder
he holds her his hands around her waist
you can let go of me now
with a wicked smile how do they look
bobby kidding like theyre made of polyester
i like them
i was sick of looking at this room
i think they add a little life
nothing like a little liveliness
with a sexy pout grace loads the next question
no more drapes to hang
now what should we do
i have an idea
and what would that be
bobby steps close to grace and takes her by the shoulders
he pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers
grace doesnt respond
all right grace
no more games
grace innocently games
you flirt with me then you run cold
you lead me on then slap me down
i dont go for being jerked around
and what game did you want to play
you carry my box for me and i fall into bed with you
bobby grabs up his pack
i think i can find my own way back to into town
maybe i like to find out about a man first
maybe i like to know what hes made of
im just flesh and blood baby
that and a few memories of bad women just like most guys
but you already know that
you read my mind remember
thanks for the lemonade
bobby turns to leave
you never did answer my question
thats not an answer
what is it you want
you know what i want
maybe i just want to hear you say it
for a beat bobby stands and stares hard at grace
his pack slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor
with great determination like a beast closing for the kill bobby moves for her
grace stands firm ready for him her head tilts back
her breath comes deep and hard
just as bobby is about to reach her just as he is about to take her he is stopped dead by the booming voice of jake mckenna
bobby turns to face jake an older man still large and formidable for his age
grace nonplussed jake
i thought you
who the hell is this
who the hell are you
im her husband
bobby shocked whisper husband
now who the hell are you and it better be good or god help me ill break you in half
i was helping your wife
i met her in town
she needed a hand with her drapes
didnt much look like you were hanging drapes
i swear to you thats all that happened
i havent so much as set foot in your bedroom
a lot that means
grace tell him
grace says nothing
she picks up a glass of lemonade and sips at it coolly
damn it grace
grace coyly if he says thats what happened jake it must be true
oh yeah and i suppose you didnt have anything to do with it grace he just wandered up here by hisself
i got a mind to put you over my knee and paddle your ass raw bobby to grace you bitch
is this what its all about
you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you
heads for the door where you going
bobby exiting scuse me you want to take my head off mister
i wont even try to stop you
i deserve it for being an idiot
but if youre not i think ill be on my way
jake punches him in the nose
you cant just walk in here and walk out you sonufabitch
im gonna tear you a new asshole
you broke my nose
it aint broke
it probably isnt but it bleeds
bobby feels the blood and then sees it on his shirt
youre lucky i dont sue you
jake opens the door get goin junior
bobby glares back at grace who gives him a maddening little smile
you people are crazy
he storms out holding his nose
bobby holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped bleeding hauling his bag on his shoulder walks back to town along the side of the road
already he is caked with a mixture of sweat and dust looking up at the relentless sun that beats down on him
a cadillac slows beside him jake driving
what the fuck do you want
ill give you a lift son
too hot to be walking
people die out here yknow
bobby continues walking
aw youre not still upset about that love tap are you
if i meant you real trouble id have given it to you by now
get in lad
bobby gets in
after you huffed off grace lied so bad i got so pissed off i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger fucked it instead
sorry i lost my cool like that
its a funny thing women
say what happened to your hand
youve got to be yeah i know
i guess weve never been introduced proper
thats a solid name
im a solid man
what brings you to superior coop
an overheated car
darrell taking good care of you
darrells a moron
jake laughs yeah he sure is a character
you need any help with that car now
where you headed
i know a man whos got a boat
wants me to sail it for him
you a sailor man
thatd be the life
drive across the country step on a boat and just sail away
a man could pretty well disappear like that
just sail away until all he was was a memory
i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile
i hope so
beat listen mckenna about your wife if i had known she was married it wouldnt have made a difference to you now would it
not a wit
do you know why
because youre a man without scruples
wait a second ah i can smell it on you
jake wipes his hand across the back of bobbys neck and holds it to his nose
thats the sweat of a man who hasnt an honest bone in his body
dont be offended lad
a man whos got no ethics is a free man
i envy that
beside how can i blame you
that grace sure has a mind of her own and a body to match dont she
jake nudges bobby who smiles a nervous smile
she does at that
i knew when i married her she was a free spirit
a woman with her looks and a man my age what was i to expect
but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you dont think you do
so i married her
what are you to do eh
cant live with them and you cant shoot em
jake looks at bobby his lips curled into a sly smile
you cant shoot em
i like that
laughs i bet she led you on good didnt she
taking you up to the house to hang drapes
oh thats a good one
bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face
i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out
then me busting in like some wild bear
bet you had a fire going under you
like you dont know
mad like a dog in heat i bet you were
i can tell you got a temper on you
bobby gives a little laugh
bet you just wanted to snap her neck right then didnt you
bet you just wanted to kill her
bobby starts to laugh heartily
jake joins in then stops abruptly
would i what
would you kill her
bobby starts to laugh
bobby stops laughing
because im sick and tired of her little games
because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again
because ive got a fifty thousand dollar life insurance policy on her and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk
for a moment bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of the offer
ive done a few things but im not a murderer mr
how do you know if youve never tried
this is a joke right
you just want to rattle me
they reach town and jake stops the car near a small grocery thats right
nothing but a joke
bobby gets out of the car
with a big smile jake says enjoy your stay lad
jake speeds away
bobby looks after him
who are these people
the store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny older mexican woman who is behind the counter
got any cold soda
you got any soda
hablar slowly por favor
my ingles no es bien
bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming
something to eat
she holds up a pack of twinkies
what the fuck is drink in spanish
the old womans eyes widen
she starts to scream but quickly clamps her hands over her mouth
for a moment bobby thinks the woman is screaming at what he has said
then as if he feels a presence behind him bobby turns slowly to face the two tough looking unshaven tattoo covered bikers
one holds a gun
thats right lady
keep it in you and nobody gets hurt
that goes for you too stud
gimmie the money
the dinero senora
hand it over
bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back
the woman goes to an old fashioned cash register and rings it open
she hands the money to the biker
lady i got kids to put through school
es all i have
the biker turns to bobby
give it now
bobby pulls a thick wad of cash plus from his pant pocket tosses it on the counter
biker thumbing through it impressed nice
just who are you beautiful
what else you got for papa
bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet flings it to him
youre getting tasty
now toss the bag sweetie
its just books
im a reader
bobby an entreaty its personal things
i like family values
give it to me
bobby takes an unsteady breath
hey man forget it
senor give him the bag
thats all right
he doesnt want to give me the bag
hes fucking with you man
biker contd he doesnt have to give me the bag
the biker grabs bobbys bag
bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag
the biker swings the gun hard clipping bobby across the forehead
bobby falls against the counter and to the floor
the woman starts to scream
the biker grabs up the pack then looking back at the woman sees a ring on her finger
he grabs her hand and pulls at the ring
the woman screams wildly
lets go man
a little extra never hurt benji would you just relax
my wedding ring
he pulls the ring from the womans finger and pushes her back
with bobbys bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave
now we go
you go to el diablo
from beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun
the woman fires a shot that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker
he falls to the ground very dead amid a shower of blood and shredded money
the second biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag
his eyes go big with greed as he fires at the old woman who ducks behind the counter
the biker grabs for the bag and whats left of the money not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her second blast into him and the
whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the biker who is very dead
bobby is staggered crawls towards the shreds
woman cursing in spanish hijos de puta
bayan a comer su propia mierda en el infierno
translation sons of bitches
go eat your own shit in hell
she comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the cash roll from the dead bikers pants
i call the sheriff
bobby gives her a hundred dollars
a hundred dollars
bobby gives her some more cash
she looks at him
finally he gives her the entire wad
no police until i leave
bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white
bobby dazed and holding his head sits on the ground next to a spigot that is dripping water
he cups his hands under the water and splashes it against his face lightly wiping the cut above his eye
the sheriffs car goes wailing by on the main drag
recoiling from being spotted bobby tries to take another drink
a scorpion crawls out of the faucet
he jumps back
darrell is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine as bobby walks up
what the hell happened to you
dont look like nothing
just banged my head
it was an accident
you got to be more careful
bobby rolls his eyes
then notices the front fenders have been removed
what the hell happened to my car
bottom hose was shot too
rotted clear through
had to put a new one in
runs like a dream now
bobby suspicious how much
you got your parts you got your labour
lets call it a hundred fifty bucks
to replace a goddamn radiator hose
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty four and a half mustang
you know how long it took me to find that hose
about an hour and a half because thats all the longer ive been gone
actually its been about three hours
youre the one thinks that cars so damn fancy
what you expect but fancy damn prices
thats a ford not a ferrari
you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford
thats not just a ford thats a sixty four and a half mustang
whats that got to do with the radiator hose
i dont know but its the reason im living here and youre just passing through
now you owe me a hundred fifty dollars
it might as well be fifteen hundred dollars because i dont have the money
then you aint gonna have the car
i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had
bobby digs through his bloodied wallet trying to hide it from darrell
he fishes out a five dollar bill
then digs out a bloody one dollar bill from his pocket
ive got five
darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of greasy bills he carries in his overalls
then youre only a hundred forty five in the hole
you can keep that dollar
now why dont you just take your american express gold card and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split
i dont have a goddamn credit card
now thats too bad
i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit cause youre gonna have to work this one off
bobby proffers his movado watch
look i got a movado
its worth at least seven eight hundred
you could sell it for that
darrell studying it who the hell to
shit cant see no numbers
you dont need numbers
thats why its expensive
look at the gold
darrell doubts that shake his head
got no day got no date
probably aint worth a ducks fart proffers his own watch
this one here cost me
and its got every doodad you can imagine
no sir ill stick with this walks away
you son of a bitch
ill have my lawyers shut you down
you aint got no credit card but you got a lawyer
sweet talk me all you want
didnt you read the sign
fuck the sign
i want my car
i want my hundred and forty five dollars
bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or not to fight for the car then wheels and walks away
darrell looks at him smirks
it is a little worn diner type stop one would find on most any open road counter with stools laminated menus a wurlitzer in the corner belching out country tunes
business is slow but its the only restaurant in town
there is a short order cook in the kitchen and flo a hard looking waitress is behind the counter
a couple of regular drivers ed and boyd are seated on the stools boyd is flipping a coin
one hundred thirteen degrees
that was back in july of forty seven
that afternoon it dropped down to forty three
one time last year i remember it went from to same day
wind black clouds come out like
bobby comes out of the mens room and sits at the end of the counter
he has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess
he buries his face in the menu
you got a beer
no we aint got no heineken
we got miller
just plain ol miller
now you can fuckin take it or you can fuckin leave it
ill fuckin take it
flo cheeseburger bleedin
ill be right back with that beer
flo moves off
and a waitress named flo
as bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him he hears from somewhere outside the diner the sound of a police radio crackling
he now feels something against his foot
he looks down and sees a cat rubbing against his leg
he gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech
in the background two teenagers sit at a booth
toby looks the part of a local wearing jeans and a white t shirt
his hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school
his girl jenny is nondescript neither ugly nor beautiful
she is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look
toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom
after he is gone jenny walks to bobby
you gotta quarter for the juke
i wanna play a song on the juke
you got a quarter
bobby looks at jenny then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her
he cant resist putting a little charm into it
what happened to your hand
i cut it shaving i know i gotta be more careful
got any requests
that country shit all sounds the same to me
how about i pick one out for you
bobby half smiles
jenny plays a song
patsy clines your cheatin heart
jenny takes up a stool next to bobbys
you like patsy cline
i just love her
how come i wonder she dont put out no more new records
cause shes dead
gee thats sad
dont that make you sad
ive had time to get over it
youre not from around here are you
where you from

toby walks back into the room
he looks at jenny
he looks at bobby
he looks at jenny talking to bobby
he loses it
no im seeing but im not believin
stop the wedding
this cant be
what are you doing with my girl
bobby says nothing ignoring toby
i axed you a question
aw toby we werent doing nothing
we was just talking
you shut your mouth girl and get back over to our table
to bobby now im not going to axe you again mister
what were you doing with my girl
i wasnt doing anything
thats not the way it looked to me

we got mans business to take care of
i aint never taken no drugs mister and
then maybe you shouldve
look pal i wasnt making a play for your girl
you expect me to believe that
i dont care what you believe as long as you leave me alone
mister im calling you out

bobby looks jenny over
toby you go finish your soda and leave the man alone
toby to bobby you know who i am
everyone round here call me tnt
you know why
theyre not very imaginative
cause im just like dynamite
and when i go off somebody gets hurt
i was making time with your girl
now im scared to death and i learned my lesson
now can you go away
not before i settle with you chickenshit
christ i dont believe this
i wasnt hitting on your girl
stand up mister or ill beat you where you sit
bobby sits for a beat
he doesnt need a fight with toby now with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either
he sits there
toby you stop it now
cant you see hes got a hurt hand
dont you never mind flo
this is gonna be over real quick
reluctantly bobby rises facing off against toby each clenching their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move
the tension builds
we see it on the faces of jenny flo and the regulars
just then the record on the juke ends and the needle scratches off
there is the crackle of a police radio as the door to the diner opens and sheriff virgil potter walks in
the tension eases
toby mindful of the sheriff steps closer to bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear
youre lucky mister
dont think its over
i called you out and im gonna see this through
you hear me
to jenny come on girl
i got half a mind to make you walk home
toby takes jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner
my lord that little baby of yours virgil has gotten cutern a bunnys nose
what was that all about
you know how that toby is
thinks every man he sees is after his jenny
more like jenny is after every man she sees
flo to bobby you pay toby no mind
he just likes to show off for his girl
give him a couple of hours hell cool off
still want that beer
bobby tense seeing the sheriff ill take it to go
bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead
hows it with you sheriff
already started out bad
couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over jamillas grocery store this morning
it was a real shootout
the old witch killed em both
is she all right
sure when the sons of bitches tried to steal her wedding ring
thats when she started shooting
cant blame her
the ring was all carlos left her when he died
stores a mess
its the desert
thats what it is
the desert makes everybody crazy
aint that right sheriff
people go crazy out here
come on boyd
ive got to make tracks
that yogurts got to make santa fe before it spoils

ed and boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit
flo stands near the cash register with bobbys beer
i cant open off sale for you sugar
bobby pays for the beer
flo opens the register
let me get your change
flo im just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee
the sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot
you be careful now virgil
just as the words leave flos mouth the sheriff spills the pot
it shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere
flo runs over to him
son of a bitch
now look at what you done
are you all right
i think i burned my gun hand
as flo bends to wipe the counter virgil touches her intimately
sheriff contd how bout we put something soft on it later
a look quietly i could put some butter on it hon
her normal abrasive voice itd serve you right you asshole
put it under some cold water
joe run get a mop and clean this fuckin mess up
while everyone is distracted bobby notices that the register drawer has been left open
he looks around to make sure he is not being watched
slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer
it gets closer and closer
as he is about to grab the money there the cat the same one he kicked away earlier hisses and claws at his hand
bobby jumps back startled
now whyd you go and scare the nice man like that
sorry about that mister
lets see you want
gives it to him you try to have a nice day now would you
sure ill try
with the sheriff occupied and the mexican jose mopping the floor bobby exits
bobby begs on the phone
cici its bobby
yeah look i know its been a while but im kind of in a jam
one hundred fifty dollars
thats a lie
i called you on your birthday
two years ago
i cant help it if you didnt get the message
cici honey i dont want to argue
i need you to wire me the money
because theyre fucking going to i didnt steal your cds
yeah well wheres my mr
bobby slams the phone
bobby is on another call circling a local sports page betting line
this is pluto
whats the line on dallas
we head about you
you owe the commie dimes why you tryin to get in my office
lose this fuckin number
hangs up bobby frustrated clicks off
it is the kind of cheesy temporary office one would expect to find in a las vegas apartment building overlooking the downtown strip
arkady dressed in a silk suit with conspicuous jewelry sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his nails
sergei his goon in a shiny polyester shirt hovers over his boss helping feed and manicure him
these are the two men from bobbys earlier flashback
they are dangerous in an endearing way
sergei answers the phone
in the background is a very voluptuous female obviously from the middle east
sergei what are you a neanderthal
how many times do i have to tell you
you answer a phone hello not da
sergei nods yes sorry mr
into phone hello
i have a collect call from bobby cooper
will you accept the charges
arkady deadbeat coopers calling
arkady doesnt acknowledge him
hes calling collect
at this mr
arkadys head springs up
he snatches the phone from sergei
arkady overly sweet bobby what a surprise
i expected to be seeing you not talking to you over the phone
bobby on the phone
i know mr
i was on my way to you its just
what a day ive had
i know im coming up with a highly improbable story and i know youre not going to believe this but this
i had the money i swear i had it
i was on my way to vegas when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere
arkady cleans his nails completely disinterested in what bobby is saying
thats a shame bobby
a real shame
and thats not the half of it mr
arkady right mr
and thats not the half of it
i got your money and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then
well it gets robbed and let me guess
this robber he gets your money
two of them
and they both get nailed
get shot by the old lady
the old lady
with a shotgun she kills both of em and
and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces
not one bill is left alive
i mean what are the odds
arkady beat dry pretty long bobby
arkady honest i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed
so now i dont have a cent to my name
i cant even get my car out of the garage
i tell you mister
pause if it werent for bad luck i wouldnt have nay fuckin luck at all you know
beat waits so i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty dollars so i could get my car out of this garage see
the bus depot here has a western union thing
and of course ill pay it back with the rest of the money
which you dont have
but which i can get
look i can sell my car in vegas
blue book its worth at least
i just need the uh
sergei looks like hes ready to pound heads
arkady pause where are you
bobby hopeful uh
a little shithole in arizona called superior
about miles east of phoenix
arkady pausing v
bobby suddenly feeling suspicious
yeah if you could send it care of
now let me get this straight
two years you give me problems with your fuckin payoffs
now you owe me thirteen thousand dollars you call me collect then ask me to wire you one hundred fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed
a hundred forty five would probably cover it
a hundred and
now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk i dont care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller
you owe me thirteen thousand dollars and i want it i dont care how you get it or where from but i want it on my desk tomorrow or ill
show you what real bad luck is
sergei snaps a pencil hes holding in his hand which goes flying by arkadys head forcing him to duck
do you understand me you little fuck
bobby snaps oh fuck you too
whatd you say to me
shit im sorry
you cant believe the strain im under
im just under a lot of strain here
there is a sharp silence at the other end
bobby you owed me that bread weeks ago
now you tell me you want another week
thats weeks bobby
thats also fingers cause you and i know its a finger a week bobby
so you got balls
good now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice and maybe i dont take the other fingers you owe me you see
tomorrow and bobby dont make me come look for you okay
have nice day
he hands the phone back to sergei
sergei into phone you got that
have nice day hangs up
the nerva that piece of shit
and look at you you neanderthal dont you fuckin break pencils you goombah
what are you a faggot
in my country a man dont pay we cut off his head
arkady motions sergei to come close
get your ass down to this superior arizona
bring me this bobby cooper
i dont think he got the lesson
this is your last chance sergei
bobby desperate stares at the bandage of his wounded hand
it throbs holding the hand to his ear
we hear an operators voice hello
are you finished with your call
please deposit an additional seventy five cents
bobby slams the phone against the hook
goddamn rats ass fuck
he marches from the phone booth past an old hardware store
the phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice thank you for using at t
in the store window bobby notices a set of garden shears for sale
bobby walks a bit going nowhere in particular
looking at his watch thinking of mr
arkady he shields himself with one hand from the sun
at the side of an old building in the bit of shade it throws he twists at the beer cap which sticks and wont turn
bobby tries again twisting harder too hard as the cap jerkily twists off cutting into his hand as it rotates
bobby yells in pain
at the same time the beer comes foaming from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve
the bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground emptying
he clutches his bleeding hand pissed
i hate this fuckin town
i hate it
do you hear me
no answer get me outta here please
i gotta get out of this place
as if in answer a jeep drives by on the main street
grace looks pretty hot up there in the drivers seat her eyes behind sunglasses flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she keeps going
bobbys eyes throw back his own hostility at her but unfortunately she misses it as he now notices across the street a well kept building with the most modern decor
and signage reading mckennas realty co
he thinks about it in a quandary
in a rented convertible we now see sergei racing across the desert
his jacket off a man with a mission
he glances at his watch eager to get to this fucking hole in the wall which is somewhere on this incomprehensible american map he holds in one hand
bobby squats looking at a real estate model of a desert development
what can i do for you lad
i was hoping we could talk
about your wife
what about her
about what you said this morning
jake shakes his head as if he doesnt understand
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife
fifty thousand dollars
you said youd cut that up with the man who did her in
dont play simple with me jake
youre a betting man
you want me to spell it out for you
ill kill grace if you cut me in on the money
boy i think this heats getting to you the way youre rambling on
im not rambling
youre talking like a madman
well then i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town
youre the one brought it up
in your car
oh that was just loose talk
husband gettin pissed off
i dont want anybody dead
you wanted me to kill her
a man doesnt always mean the things he says
you meant it
what makes you say that
because youre a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money
and what does that make you
the slimy bastard whos going to do it for you
pause youre a jealous man jake
if you cant have grace to yourself
well youre not the sharing kind
for a moment jake stares quietly at bobby
well i guess i have what you call a love hate relationship with grace
you love her but you hate her
no i hate loving her
i hate the kind of person she is
i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays
like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me
she loved to play
she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it
she tortures me
but shes family
shes my little girl
i couldnt stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull
you got the killing in you boy
how much you want
make it twenty
jake stressed paces twenty thousand
i dont have that kind of money
i wont get the insurance until months after shes dead
i dont imagine youll want to be stickin around after poor graces demise
twenty thousand thats more money than i could ever get my hands on
how much could you get
and thats a maybe
i need thirteen
thats a bit much
were not talking about buying a car jake
were talking about killing your wife
its thirteen or its nothing
for a moment the two men stand silent
all we hear is the ticking of a grandfather clock that stands in the corner
you drive a hard bargain but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you
im not your boy
i dont like you
i got no choice but to do business with you
lets just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience
dont say that
i had a marriage of convenience with grace and look where thats lead
well looks like we got ourselves a contract
bobby sarcastic do we shake hands
if you cant trust the man youve hired to kill your wife
the thing is its got to look like an accident thats the thing
if it doesnt then its no good
i wont get a dime and its my neck thatll be on the chopping block while youre living it up somewhere
how do you want it
how the hell should i know
ive never had a wife killed before
you want this job you dont know how to do this
i guess i should have hired a professional
you want to do this yourself
i dont have to do this you know
be quiet boy
i got to figure this thing
it cant be done at the house
it should be
jake walks the office thinking
come to think of it how bout some money upfront
oh yeah sure
why dont i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while im at it
i know you then this is what you do go to the house to see her
beat and tell her what
bobby stands on the porch talking to grace through the screen of the front door
the look on his face is sincere
hers is skeptical
we see the action take place as we hear jakes v
i dont know
tell her you had to see her
tell her you dont care if shes married or not you had to be with her
sweet talk the woman
a young buck like you must be good at that
maybe shift the conversation
get her thinking about that jeep of hers
she loves that thing
maybe the only thing she does love
shell want to take you for a ride
i know youre not surprised im back here cause you can read my mind and all
shes not surprised
grace seeing his new cut thats some cut
i told you to be more careful
yeah well i said i was an idiot
whatta you say we get out of here take a drive somewhere talk
how do you know hes still not here
guys like me take those chances
graces jeep cuts hard across the desert
grace has a wild excited look on her face
bobby sits next to her looking somewhat nervous
shell take you out somewhere in the desert
she loves it out there ridin through the red rock and the mesas
so do i
i guess we got that in common
shell ride you out someplace quiet
grace has stopped the jeep on a plateau
bobby sits beneath its shade while grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the heat
vultures swoop above
there wont be anyone for miles around
just the two of you and some prairie dogs
you can sweet talk her a little if you like
makes no difference to me
just put her at ease make her feel relaxed then do it jakes v
the scene is now synch with real time
are there snakes out here
they hear you comin
they wont bother you
just dont sneak up on em
doesnt the isolation bother you
yeah but i like the sun
i grew up on a reservation
the sun the desert they like a religion to us
jakes the same way
he loves the desert
i guess were alike that way
thats about the only way
you love him
did you ever
depends on what you call love
i grew up on a reservation
a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere
thats where they stick indians bobby
thats where they leave us to die
my brother killed himself when he was cause he couldnt take it anymore
theres no hope there
jake was my ticket out
mom and me
is that why youre with him
i let him think he was courtin me but i reeled him in like a fish on a line
i wanted him
i wanted what he could give me and i wouldve done anything to get him
is that love
im guessing no
yeah i guess youre right
i take it things didnt much work out the way you planned
im still here arent i
grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert
the vultures are very much a part of this landscape
all this nothing
it doesnt get to jake like it gets to me
he says he dont mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond
more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole
you could leave him
i dont know how
its not that easy
maybe you can take chances maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please
i dont want to be alone
i need to know im going to be taken care of
you need a meal ticket is what you mean
some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here
is that so bad
its not like i wouldnt try to make him happy
for awhile anyway
i mean i would
do things for him
i guess im no good that way
i guess i tried to sucker you along like that
do you hate me for it
i wouldnt blame you if you did
but maybe its like you said you just got to do whatever it takes to get out
bobby soft echo whatever it takes
grace steps to the edge of the plateau
i wish i was a bird
i know its stupid
every child says that
when i was growing up some of the old ones on the reservation believed people could actually change into animals
i wish i could
we see bobby behind grace
he stares at her standing on the edge of the plateau
he rises and walks towards her slowly but with deliberation
if i was a bird i would fly to florida to disney world
i always wanted to go there
id fly to new york
i guess new york isnt the best place to be a bird
id fly to st
louis then new orleans all over texas
then id fly to california
i guess by then id have seen it all and i could die
bobby now stands a few feet behind grace
she kicks a rock and watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness below
they say you dont feel anything
the shock kills you before you hit the ground
i dont know how they would know that
but i heard its just like flying straight down into the ground
i guess if it doesnt hurt its a beautiful thing
bobby tenses himself
sweat forms on his brow as he stands directly behind grace with his hands extended before him
they hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward
suddenly grace wheels
startled by bobby she almost falls over the edge
bobby grabs her her weight still going back
graces life is literally in his hands
she looks down at the ground far below then up into bobbys eyes
she shows no fear but instead wears a curious smirk
hates a funny thing
right now i bet you dont know if you want to kill me or fuck me
bobby hesitates then pulls grace close and kisses her with great ardor on the lips
on a blanket on the ground bobby and grace make love quickly hotly her dress pulled up his pants down
but grace is troubled and pulls out further frustrating bobby
her eyes withdraw into another dimension as she hikes her dress back up
bobby comes out of his own head feels the distance between them
whats the matter
dont feel like nothing
he finishes relieving himself behind a tree puts his pants back on
get out of town bobby as quick as you can
grace ive been fucked over too many times by too many women
youre becoming the queen of hot and cold
youd never understand
its just such a mess
with jake i mean
nothing i understand better than a mess
grace in great tension jake was with my mom after my real dad died
you mean the shaman
he was a shaman
in the mine
we had nothin after he died
jake took us in gave us a little money
he used to call me his little halfbreed
he kept mom on the side yknow cause he was married someplace else
he had kids in phoenix i think no one knew him around here
but the thing was
pause he was raping me the whole time
he loved to do things to me
believe it or not he used to say he was in love with my ass
yever been in love with a womans ass
the dominoes are tumbling for bobby
youre sick too
he loved to do things to me
it tore her up cause she couldnt do nothing about it
she become alcoholic
and the funny thing is i liked it
i liked being controlled by jake
the truth was as far out and crazy as he got i wanted more i wanted to go all the way
women say they dont want to be taken like really taken thats bullshit they do
the first time he finished with me he said i was a woman now
then he started crying like a baby
wanted me to hold him
its a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years but still want to hold him comfort him
they found my mom right down there points at the bottom of apache leap
she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil
sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane
but ill never believe she ran off that cliff by accident
she was born on this earth and she loved it
she was like me
she just wanted to fly away
bobby is quietly stunned
a whole world has opened up to him and he isnt sure yet where the story ends
there is some force at work here beyond his control
after he got his divorce he forced me to marry him
but when i saw her body i swore to her on my soul that some day id get jake for what he did to her
what do you want
shrugs stoic have you ever been to california
grace as if in a dream is it far from here
its far its another world
is it pretty
its beautiful beautiful beaches
blue water and clear skies as far as you can see
grace like a little girl would you take me with you
bobby pause i wish i could
i wont hang on you
as soon as we get there you can dump me
i dont care
i just want to get out of here
honey baby i cant i cant even get out of here myself believe it or not i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from
that crazy mechanic
you know he and jake are
you dont have any money put away do you
jake never gives me moren twenty bucks at a time like a bird in a cage he dont want me goin anywhere
you could get me money
ill get you out of here
she looks at him
the words hang there thick between them
jake hides it
in a safe
in the floor
in the bedroom
he counts it
he loves to sit there and count it
what do you mean
he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it
i heard him
my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there
bobbys eyes widen in hope
in cash oh yeah
theres nothing else with jake
he dont trust banks
he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed
he loves it so much he wouldnt think of spending any of it on me
i never seen it but i know hes got more than a hunnert thousand at least
one hundred thousand
that son of a bitch
grace puzzled what do you mean
bobby ignoring her if its in a safe wed have to get the combination it takes a key
he keeps it on himself all the time
i mean all the time it scratches up against me when we do it
if the keys on him how do we get the key
spoken almost innocently it hangs there between them
i cant kill grace
i cant kill anybody
its not like hes a young man bobby
hes had time to live
itd be quick
i mean he wouldnt even have to feel it
seductively i mean sometime in the middle of the night when its quiet
when hes asleep you could just come up behind him when hes pounding on me and
grace lays her hands on bobby starting to caress him
he bristles and freezes with fear and disgust
listen to you
are you crazy grace
he abruptly pulls away
i think this place is making me crazy
i was crazy to come back here and see you
im crazy for listening to anyone in this town and id sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute with you
grace rises covering her nakedness shooting a hand to his face like she did when she read his fortune
but its in you bobby
i see it
i see death
its in your heart
let it out for me
let it out
then do it for me bobby youll never regret it
i promise you
ill do anything for you
anything bobby pauses terribly torn
take me back to town
he turns away towards the jeep
grace has a tone of desperation in her voice
you need the money bobby
its a lot more than
a lot more
how are you going to get out of here
you need the money
whatever it takes bobby remember
bobby walks past the jeep on his way back to town alone
where you going
ill give you the ride
its three miles
bobby doesnt look back
her eyes drift backwards into her solitude
grace to herself bobby
whatever it takes
bobby walks through the desert parallel to the road still in a rage
desert insects produce a cacophony of drones buzzes and clicks
a rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush
a voice whispers to him
youve got the killing in you boy
bobby turns and looks around
next time youll do just fine
the screen burns a bright white
in a news pot further down the street from where he was first seen the old blind man sits with his dead dog speaking as if into camera sipping on
its the desert that makes you crazy
the loneliness out here
nobody to talk to
people on the run
i seen some peculiar things on a hot day
i seen a scorpion sting itself to death
it just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again
a little killer killing itself
seen a coyote kill itself too
just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs
near tore one clean off before it bled to death
and what a white manll do when its freezing one moment hot as hell the next
a man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another smacking his lips kiss kissy kiss
nice pussy ysee see it coming
i dont know what it is about the desert
i figger its sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire
people is mostly water
we boil when its hot
cept when we boil the waters got no place to go
it just churns inside of us until we can cool off
if its not too late
bobby is now revealed standing next to the blind man and we realize the blind man has been talking to him all along
bobby sips a dr
pepper as well
you sure seen a lot for a blind man
just cause i aint got eyes doesnt mean i cant see
that a fact
bobby noticing now all the little newspaper clippings that the blind man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall
i can see just fine
for example youre a young man who thinks hes got someplace to be
a police radio crackles bobby tensing
maybe i do
or maybe you just think you do
just another small town
one guy chasing you
you go big town
just gonna have four guys after you instead
kiss kissy kiss
it gets down to one thing are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing
cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can but wherever you go thats where you gonna be
i think ive heard that before
what do you want for free
you sure got a lot of philosophy old man
seems like i do but only cause end of the day were all eyes in the same head
and everything is everything
and everything is nothing too
bobby shakes his head maybe one day ill get to sit on a corner and spout wise
think youll live that long
bobby is clearly unnerved by this
suddenly the blind man stands pissed and powerful sniffing the air with the police radio in it
as sheriff potter cruises by glancing at bobby shrinking
the car goes on up the street
i hear you
always sneaking around
thinks i cant see him
well hes right
but that aint mean i dont know whats going on around here
theyre all cursed
all them miners last century
hungry ghosts killed off all the indians
up at the mine
earth ran red with blood think im fooling around here
white sky was on fire
grown men cried like babies
i saw a flash then darkness descended upon me
they put me in the joint
took my eyes
i cursed them
white people cant seem to stay away from indians grabs his bandaged hand smelling the blood
you gotta watch where ya put your fingers
pussy pussy pussy indian pussy
it sounds demented
bobby checking him out to see if hes really blind walks quietly around him during this monologue and peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind mans real eyes
although he thinks the blind man thinks hes on the other side of him the blind man fools him by suddenly swivelling around and cranking a gob of spit into
bobbys face as if bobby were on the other side
bobby pissed wipes the spittle from his face
blind man finishing but they gotta know you dont fuck around with indians
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war
so now youre going to tell me where i lost my eyes
you dont think i know where i lost my eyes
i was there when i lost them
i lost them in the war
the war in the joint
theres always wars in the joint

bobby starts to walk away
the blind man rattles his tin cup
but aint you got a little something for the infirm
im a little short pops
ill catch you next time
your lies are old but you tell em well
bobby depressed is heading towards harlins gas station passing jenny sitting on a corner drinking a soda almost as if waiting for him
she runs to him and follows him as somewhere a police radio crackles and buzzes
mister i just

love each other and we gonna run off and im gonna have his love child
will you shut up
you gonna pay for that mister
toby and bobby square off sizing each other up and preparing for a violent confrontation
just as the two are about to clash we hear the voice of sheriff potter from off camera
the two men freeze in their tracks as potter drives up fast
hey sheriff potter
sheriff tough toby i just came from your mothers place
shes worried sick about you
she says she aint seen you since this morning
that aint true sheriff
i was home for lunch
boy im not trying to hear nothing from you except that youre heading home
now run along

i want to stay
i said come on
toby grabs jenny by the wrist and literally pulls he along
as she goes she yells back to bobby
dont go nowhere without me
i wanna have your love child
toby points a vicious finger at bobby
next time mister
toby and jenny exit leaving bobby and the sheriff alone
bobby would also like to exit fast
where ya goin
bobby has no choice
he gets in
seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today
youre not planning on staying are you
im not going to be around long if thats what youre worried about
thats a nasty cut you got there

there was a young fellow over at jamillas today when it got hit
way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers
sounds like it
i wish i could help sheriff but i just want to get my car and get on up the road
jake drives up in his gold caddy
his windows whirr down

he eyes bobby
sheriff a little nervous just fine jake

jake looking at bobby whatcha got there some trash
he drives off
the sheriff drives on
peculiar how things happen
a mans car breaks down
theres a hold up
people die and all that money and now old jake out looking for his young wife
and then you show up
the sheriff looks right through bobby who knows this is more than a conversation
he pulls up to harlins garage
bobby gets out
times running out son
ill be seeing you in the morning
with this thinly veiled threat the sheriff drives on
as bobby watches feeling the pressure to get out now while he can
darrell is cleaning his tools
bobbys mustang sits prominently in the car bay washed and gleaming as bobby walks up
i was beginnin to think you wasnt comin back
you dont look so good
yeah well ive been around the bend a bit
one of those days you feel like you been runnin in circles and you aint no closer to where you tryin to get than when you started

you owe me money and this car aint going nowheres until i get it
and if you take another five hours ill find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it
is that clear
now get out of here fore i call the sheriff who knows me bobby is in a rage
he turns to leave and walks a few paces
he sees a wrench lying on a table
for a second his mind reels then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on darrells head
he stops cold
because ol darrell holds a crowbar in a batters stance ready to smash it onto the mustang
you want to play mister
ill play with you
you want to smash something
so do darrell pulls back the crowbar ready to swing
whats the matter
the fight gone out of you
im just gonna smash a headlight
bobby pleading almost crying please just leave the car alone
mister you already pissed me off but good
darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car and drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch
bobby about to lose it goddamn you
you son of a bitch
there you go sweet talking me again
darrell begins to laugh
bobby desperate looks to the trunk thinking of his gun in there
his pov the trunk
a flashback of the gun goes through his mind
ill get you your money
i just have to get something out of the trunk
using his trunk key he tries to open it but realizes the lock has been changed
what the fuck did you do to my trunk
well that keys not gonna work
i had to pop the lock
you didnt leave me the trunk key
and you had to go into the trunk didnt you
when i work on a car i work on a car
bobby snaps you motherfucker
you cant help yourself can you mister
youre out of control
darrell starts to laugh
it is a repetitive almost demonic laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on bobbys anguished face
as bobby steps out into the glaring sun he notices down at the other end of the town graces jeep parked right outside the sheriffs office empty
presently grace and the sheriff walk out talking and she gets in says a few last words and drives away
bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet
is she selling him out
hes very confused turbulent
bobby enters the bus depot
the interior is poorly lit
there are a few benches for people to wait on but they sit empty
old faded travel posters hang on the wall
a bored female clerk is behind the counter
i need a ticket
out of here
but in particular
you got a bus that goes to mexico
thats where i have to go
mexico is a large country
where in mexico would you like i dont care just get me there
the clerk is a little put off by bobby
he seems delirious
she goes through her schedule looking for a bus
how about ciudad juarez
you could take a local arrives in two hours and transfer in albuquerque
itll get you across the border
one way or round trip
twenty more will get you back
bobby counts his money
twenty seven fifty
thats all i got
the ticket is
bobby rifling his pockets i bought a beer
that was a dollar something
then i gave that girl cents for the juke box
and the blind man
id have if
im sorry sir
for the ticket
bobby to himself yeah
just a little short
i just wanted to get out thats all
bobby starts to walk away
suddenly he turns runs back at the clerk proffers his money half crazed near tears
please maam you dont understand
i have to get out of here
theyre going to come looking for me
theyre going to kill me if i cant get this ticket then im going to have to do things to get out of here
you know what i mean i dont want to hurt anybody i just want to leave
hes so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town
okay ill give you the ticket sir but
just please calm down please
her sane tone reminds bobby of how far down hes come
he shrinks suddenly ashamed of himself
she takes the cash on the counter hands him a ticket
keep your change
bus three twenty three
leaves at seven fifty two tonight
she nods puts a closed sign in the ticket window disappears
we hear the crackle of the same police radio again off camera as bobby walks out of the depot
ticket preciously held in his hand and suddenly reels as he sees sergei about a yards down the main stretch slowly rolling into town in his convertible looking for guess
bobby turns away but not fast enough
sergei spots him hits the pedal
got you shitface
bobby ducking around a corner hears the brief whoop of the sheriffs police siren
he glances back
his pov sure enough the sheriffs having a field day
hes just pulled sergei over
at this distance we catch snippets of conversation as the sheriff ambles from his car checking sergeis out of state plates
wheres the fire sweetheart
dont know how they work things in nevada but we got speed limits in this state
i am going miles an hour
i am looking town
i not even moving
we pop in closer to their conversation bobby relishing this in his minds eye
sergei is constantly looking off to where he last saw bobby
but the sheriff strangely pays no attention to these looks
whoa what kind of accent you got there
you one of them russians
i am russian da
i am also rich russian da
maybe we work something out my friend sheriff
you trying to bribe me mister
just cause you russians aint commies anymore dont think money can buy everything
down the street sheriff potter is holding up a concealed gun
he grabs the gun concealed is a definite no no in this town ivan
you know anything about jamillas grocery store
what fuckin grocery store you fucking shithead idiot
you call yourself a police
sergei looking bobbys direction
get out of the car spread them
you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up you commie motherfucker
either way youre goin to the can
i want my lawyer
sheriff cuffs sergei and sticks him in the police car
bobby cant help smiling as he turns away to the soda machine seen in an earlier scene
he comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and dying for a drink in this heat inserts the coin
though still under considerable pressure from all sides this lucky break with sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new today some luck
the icy cold soda bottle shoots out
bobby raises it to his lips about to taste it about to relax for once
violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a kidney punch
he stumbles forward into the soda machine gasping
the legs of his assailant are close to him but the face is unseen
bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine re opening the wound
blood starts to seep through the bandage
bobby crumples to the ground as toby now towers over him with his fists curled and a snarl on his lips
get up mister
dont ever let it be said toby tucker beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance
bobby gasping what the hell are you doing
you fucking psycho
im doing what any man would do if hed been offended
im stompin your ass
you dont even know what youre fighting over
my honor thats what im fighting over
now get up off the ground or do i have to whoop you where you lie
jenny comes running up the street
toby tucker leave him alone
you stay away jenny
i aim to mess him up and that aint a thing for a woman to see
jenny runs to bobby and cuddles him where he lays
dont be afraid of him none
i dont care what he does to you we can still be together
get away from me
bobby sees his bus ticket on the ground
he grabs for it but toby beats him to it
now whats this
give it to me
you going to mexico
you never have to see me again
just please give me the ticket
this means something to you
jenny means something to me
toby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole
toby between bites im gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin nothing but soup the erst of your days
rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when im done
im gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick
tobys words drift to bobby from a million miles away
the world around him is like a dream or a nightmare
a primal rage wells inside of bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the soda bottle up out of nowhere across tobys head smashing him backwards
then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on the boys face and head
jenny screams stop it
youre killing him
jenny grabs bobbys arm literally hanging all her weight on it stopping him from striking toby again
youre killing him
jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles toby
he looks at toby then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief
his bandage is soaked with his own blood but his adrenaline numbs the pain
you killed him
you killed him
she wails in the background as he backs away around the corner into main street crossing to where the phone booth is
bobby is on the phone
grace in the kitchen is also on the phone
grace coolly i thought youd be on your way to vegas by now
is there something you wanted
i wanted to talk
i dont think we have anything to talk about
what about us
there is no us remember
except i cant get you out of my head grace
beat stop it
am i making you hot or does the truth scare you
because i know youre full of shit
i mean it grace
im getting out of here and i want to take you with me
i thought you couldnt get your car
i could if i had jakes money
is that what changed your mind
i dont give a damn about the money
i want you and i want to get us out of this shithole
theres only one way to do that
are you sure
about me i mean
i came back for you this morning i came back
before i even knew about the money
youre what i want
then the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake
but ive had nothing but time to think about it
it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here
but weve got to get the money baby
we get the money i get the car then we get the hell out
you said you couldnt kill anybody
we dont have to kill him
just knock him out and tie him up till we get away
beat it was your idea remember
im doing this for you
im doing this so you can fly
fly like a bird
grace bites at a nail and fidgets but says nothing
ill leave the back door unlocked
she quickly hangs up the phone
bobby also hangs up the phone an unreadable expression on his face
jake sits in an easy chair reading a paper
puffs of smoke from his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over his head
grace stands in the doorway body stiff and arms crossed staring at him
who was that on the phone
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number
but then you make friends so easily
dont you grace
grace has no answer for that so she says nothing
a long moment passes then i put up new drapes jake
i was here when your apprentice was helping you
you never said anything
about the drapes
they look nice
you havent even looked at them once
jake lowers the paper looks at the drapes
they look nice
i picked them out for you jake
i thought you would like the colors
jake softly admiring you look just like your mama when you move like that against the light
grace stares at the chain now visible around jakes neck that disappears under his shirt
she knows that hidden there is a key and she fixes on it intently
what the hell you looking at girl
the sun is setting
it strikes the horizon sending a ripple of golden light through the sky
a man dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms
a dog and cat huddle together in sleep
sheriff virgil potter is tossing horseshoes with his deputies
grace watches the sun going down outside her house cradling herself in her arms
a desert wind gently caresses her
the blind man along with his dead dog sits on the side of the street
well thats it
suns going down
people go home trade stories over dinner
theyll talk about the day about the heat laugh about something crazy it made them do
theyll kiss sleep a few hours then do it all over again
bobby now appears next to the blind man holding two dr
he hands one to the blind man takes a sip of the other one and offers him his own change
the day wasnt so bad
we all got through it all right
blind man giving back the change keep it
theres a suggestion of cockiness in bobby feeling his luck coming back with the night
his humour is enhanced by his pov down the street as darrell with his dilapidated truck readies sergeis convertible for towing
aint over yet
night is part of day separate but equal
night is when you let your guard down when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark
difference between you and me old man is i see the glass half full you see it half empty
night is when you want to sleep but the dry heat keeps you tossin and turnin
its when you wish the sun was bakin high in the sky so you could see what it is youre afraid of
you afraid of the dark
afraid of it
boy i live in the dark
all cause of a woman who made me this way
people are afraid of what they cant see
i cant see nuthin so its all the same to me
kiss from a beautiful woman kissy kissy kiss a lick from a dog slurp slurp the kiss of death he makes a strange sound
its all the same to me
so were all just floating along like twigs in a stream so enjoy the ride
is that it
more or less
not this twig friend
i got plans
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a mans plans
we all got plans
i planned on seeing all my life
i know you didnt plan on straying into town
no and i dont plan on sticking around either
well dont say i didnt warn you when things go your way
you got a lotta philosophy in you old timer but you dont fool me for one second with all this blind man crap
one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam next its the joint
now its a woman
im hep to you
the blind man slowly lifts his glasses showing his eyes at last
where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh
an ugly sight that even takes bobby back a step
used to be a young smartass like you
then i got smart with the wrong mans daughter
got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble
you know human beings aint always just human they got animals living inside em too
people give spare change to war heroes not fools
all fools get is pity
may not have eyes but i see
and you boy
the blind man puts his glasses back on
you got my pity
bobby doesnt believe him hope she was worth it
oh she was worth it
she was worth every black minute since
bobby looks at his watch gets ready to go drops a coin into the blind mans cup
any last words of wisdom
things aint always the way they seem
you got to ask yourself is it worth it
day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart
then you better know what it is youre doing
are you a human being or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin around
bobby walks away smiling
you are crazy you know
be seeing you old man
you know i wont be seeing you
the blind man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if he sees we dont really know
he reaches into the cup and pulls out the coin bobby tossed in
gives me back my own money
well jesse times up lets go for a walk
the blind man now stands up and pulls the seeing eye dogs harness
the dog struggles to its feet and they walk off down the street together
grace stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock
jake yells to her from another room
what the hell you doin grace
are you coming to bed or arent you
for a moment graces hand wavers above the lock
suddenly like a snake striking her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt
just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the bedroom
a light is on in the bedroom window
after a moment it dims and the house is dark silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight
bobby steps into frame carrying an iron pipe
we start close on grace a key slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan
we reveal grace copulating on all fours with jake from behind
ya little bitch you like it dont you
you like it this way rough and hard
gotta go fuck around on me like your mama but you always gotta come home to daddy dont you cause you know daddys the best
yes yes hit me
beat me please
you been a bad girl grace
you took my heart from your mama didnt ya
you betrayed her
like you did me
there aint no forgivin ya girl
oh please forgive me papa
you broke her heart
you broke your mamas heart
you stole me
fuck it away
but it aint ever goin away cause your mama shes like a hungry ghost baby she wont go away she wont leave ya alone
he hits her
in a strange flashback of his mind he now sees graces mama beneath him receiving his punishment
he stops abruptly
he cant go on
fear coming into his eyes
he starts to whimper begging for his punishment and or forgiveness
oh baby im so sorry
im so sorry
he starts to cry i didnt mean to hurt you so bad
he drops down burying his face between graces legs
forgive me baby forgive me
he hides there from the world that he has created crying to himself
grace has an unreadable expression but thats certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship
the knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens
bobby slips quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the door behind him
it is nearly pitch dark and he has no bearings
he steps gingerly through the hall but in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the
jake hears the noise
he raises his head and cocks an ear to the air
she knows who it is and is concerned hes too early
whats the matter
you didnt hear something
yeah i heard a key slapping against my ass
theres someone in the house
grace nervous maybe
maybe the wind blew something over encouraging him to continue
come on baby keep going
jake climbs out of bed throwing on some pants reaching into a drawer in the chest of clothes pulling out a small dark metallic object
grace realizing whats that
jake wheres you get that
he goes to the door
she follows tries to block the door
jake dont go out there
call the sheriff
just like your mama always scared of things
he maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor
crowbar in one hand bobby makes his way slowly through the living room banging against the edge of a table
he hops silently in pain then waits at the door to the next room and listens
hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the darkness
a moment later bobby backs from the door and we see the barrel of his own black
mm baretta pressed against his forehead
jake appears now backing him into the living room
he switches on a lamp
as i live and breathe
i didnt expect to be seeing the like of you again
thought youd be long on your way by now
jake continues to press the gun to bobbys head
thats my gun
then that fucking darrell
i like darrell
he may be an idiot but hes my half brother
we own harlins together yeah that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out
bobby realizing you been workin me the whole time
i guess this is what they call ironee
its not what you think jake
no but it dont matter anyway when youre lying there with your brains all over my carpet and im telling sheriff potter about this drifter didnt have enough money to
fix his car
and darrell happened to find his gun and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away and figgered he might try to break in and steal
wait a minute
just listen to me
and he thought hed clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper
and then maybe borrow or or
bobby very serious thats not the reason im here jake
theres another reason
it better be good
grace makes her way down the hall in a nightgown and now hides in shadow listening
i came for grace
you came to take my wife from me
bobby sincere no
i came to kill her
graces eyes get real narrow and angry
its the truth jake
thats a thick change of heart from this afternoon
maybe i dont like being played like she played us today
maybe i dont like that at all jake
im just pissed enough maybe ill rip the neck off my own grandmother
you have a lot of talk in you whole lot of talk
damn it jake
there is a guy coming to kill me and if it comes down to me or grace then i pick grace
you were going to give me thirteen thousand
give me two hundred
ill kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it
she showed me the perfect place
there wont be enough left for an autopsy
but i need the the money
ive got to have the money
jake is silent
he takes his time thinking
finally shes in the bedroom
grace distressed starts backing off towards the bedroom
bobby stares at the automatic in jakes hand
wanna give me my gun
jake laughs a dont even think about it look
a stranglingll do just fine
go to work
bobby holds up his eight fingers with a you try look
bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet
how bout the pipe
jake sarcastic shes got a slender neck
bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom
jake follows into an adjoining room
hold on a second
bobby turns to jake who is suddenly extremely upset
how the hell did you know where the bedrooms at
what are you talking about
jake getting closer this morning when i came in on you and grace you swore you hadnt been near the bedroom
now you make straight for it
grace returns to listen
this thing is like a seesaw battle of wills
come on jake dont jake me boy
its a big house
you probably didnt even make it out to the desert this afternoon
jake has come right up on bobby in a rage
or did you just ply the afternoon away between my sheets putting your lips all over her you little horndog
bobby changing tactics what difference does it make if i slept with her
were gonna kill her
i dont give a damn about her
but killing hers one thing
fucking her behind my back thats another
suddenly jake swings his arm clipping bobby across the side of the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash
bobby crumbles to his knees crying out
jake suddenly grabs bobby by the hair forcing his face back and smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss
the blood from bobbys wound runs down to his lips and mixes with jakes lips
now youve tasted both of us
he pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at bobbys head
bobby sees it coming plays his last card on his knees
i admit it
i fucked her
but its her you have to worry about not me she wants you dead jake
she wants you dead and she wants your money
jake hesitates what are you babbling about
bobby talking fast think about it
how do you think i got in here
did you hear any glass break
did you hear a door splinter
how did the evening end
after you went to bed did she linger a bit
maybe just long enough to leave the door unlocked
is that what happened
like an old rag jake gradually soaks all this up becoming heavier with the weight of the knowledge
youd tell me anything to save your pathetic life
you know what kind of woman grace is jake
you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior
whats she to you jake a woman who wants you dead
let me kill her
all i want is two hundred dollars to get out of here with
two hundred dollars
two hundred dollars
ill do it
ill kill her
jake stares down at bobby on the floor
sweet christ id be doing the world a favor ridding it of the likes of you
get your miserable ass off the floor
youre positively pathetic
go on go kill grace
bobby slowly stands
im not letting you walk for nothing
two hundred dollars
do it boy
kill her bobby goes
grace bolts back to the bedroom the camera following her as she flies
bobby walks it
his pov the door
every step seems freighted
grace is in a quandary
how many seconds before bobby walks in to kill her
or can he really kill her
shes not sure
she looks around the room frantically
picks up a lamp puts it down
she looks quickly through her closet rummages below in the boxes
suddenly she finds it
a dangerous looking indian hatchet with a feather hanging off its bindings
its a formidable piece of iron quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh
grace hears the footsteps just outside the door
she runs behind the door
a moment later the bedroom door creaks open and bobby quietly enters approaching the bed
we sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her
in a reverse pov bobby sees the outline of grace in the bed as victim
he now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure
he suddenly hears a foot fall behind him then he feels her presence
shes directly behind him hatchet raised
his life is in her hands
his eyes locked in an eternal moment
her eyes the hatchet
as jake anxiously torn waits there is a loud crash followed by sounds of struggle of murder of death
it is a desperate cry for help
jake cant help himself
he breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved
jake bulls into the bedroom
its a mess furniture overturned sheets and blankets all over the floor
the lights broken
waiting for him face down on the floor is bobbys body in a pool of liquid
a broken bottle lies nearby
bobbys body heaves in its final death throes and then shudders quiet
over there by the bed is grace who still clutches the hatchet
the look on her face is pure shock
looks like you got him grace
thats real good
he must of slipped past me but you got him
looks like that drifter from this morning
got to be careful who you make friends with sweetheart
jake eyes the weapon in graces hand
why dont you put that down
its all over now
put it down
grace eyes the gun in jakes hand
go on girl
put it down
what choice does grace have
she lets the hatchet clank to the floor
aww thats my grace not about to let someone get the best of her
thats what i love about you
as dangerous as you are unpredictable
behind jake the lifeless bobby rises up from the floor very much alive and clobbers jake with a golf club
jake is staggered but hes one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly gun still in one hand as if to fire
before he can grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back
he gurgles stunned from both sides but its like trying to kill rasputin
he still has the gun as bobby jumps him from the rear trying to get his neck in a chokehold
the gun fires once discharging into the wall
the hatchet is ripped from his back
grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo type fight jake seeking to dislodge bobby off his back
an expression of fear and excitement in her eyes
finally the two men go crashing to the ground rolling around bobby maintaining his stranglehold but calling to her his hands full
grace goddamit do something
jakes eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale pleading for help
jumping into the fray its not clear whose side shes really on as the three of them roll across the floor strangling biting hitting spitting scratching gasping
its a guignol but the pressure from bobbys forearm is taking its toll on jake
trying to bite jake grace bites bobby instead but then she scratches jakes face
jake is grabbing her hard as bobby chokes him trying to use her to leverage himself away
but she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor
she grabs the hatchet
and stands moving back towards the two men locked on the floor
bobby looks up at her hatchet in hand no longer sure which way shell go
jake however gasping for air eyes bulging spittle dripping from his mouth looks at grace with some inner certainty that she will help him
he gasps the words
help me grace help
like you helped her jake
grace stands there deciding the power of the hatchet in her hands
she raises it suddenly over the two men
it flashes downwards
deep into the gut of her husband jake almost transfixing him to the floor
in the silence that follows jakes eyes roll up to meet hers
but all she has for him is a cold distant stare
jakes head drops as the life rushes out of him
bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat
what the helld you wait for
she doesnt answer turbulence in her face
he rolls jakes body off upset
she may have made it a murder but he was part of it and he feels the shift in himself
theyre both in new territory feeling an apartness between them
suddenly jake gasps still alive
it is too much for bobby
he grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on jake silencing him one last time
grace is pushing the bed away from the wall slipping down on her knees and prying open several floorboards
the moneys right here
get the key
you get it
he doesnt want to get close to jake
grace coldly runs over to his corpse ripping the chain key and all from the neck
the action pulls jakes head up then she lets it thump back on the floor
she runs back to the floorboards
the top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed
bobby watches his whole life it seems hanging on the outcome
with the key she opens the safe
inside are rolled up bundles of cash in hundred dollar denominations
she looks up at him offering it as she reaches in for more
bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more sucked into the fever of freedom far more money than he lost at the grocery store
overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom
they see each other
didnt i tell you
bobby plunging into the cash there must be thousand here
goddamnit grace you were right
we done it bobby
oh my god
they laugh excitedly and start kissing rolling in the stacks of cash some of which sticks to bobbys sweating back
the day didnt turn out so bad after all for bobby
fuck me baby
bobby looking at jake what about him
let him watch
i want him to know what hes missing
as they consummate their violent relationship for the first time jakes lifeless eyes watch them
the light in the bedroom window is low candlelight but we sense something watching them
graces silhouette moves across a window
bobby now comes out of the house cautious walking down the driveway
he stops thinks and walks back to open the hood of graces jeep
he reaches into the engine and disconnects something then closes the hood and walks on
bobby walks up to the shack near the garage and bangs on the door
a light goes on in the window
darrell shouts out
what you want
come back when the sun comes up
bobby in a hurry to get back should grace pull any tricks bangs and kicks against the door
darrell yanks the door wide
what the hell
oh its you
listen i got a waitress coming over
what do you want
i want my car
you got the money
bobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to darrell
the mechanic fingers it suspiciously
two hundred dollars in hundred dollar bills
and this morning you was broke
thats none of your business
get the keys
i dont want no dirty money
i run an honest business
yeah like al capone on tax day
get the keys
darrell pause well theres a overnight storage charge we got to talk about
bobby is ready at first to explode but then just laughs out loud
you got to give it to a guy like darrell
he holds up a bill
all i gots a hundred darrell
you got change
theres a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun
bobby pulls the hundred back from darrells grasp
darrell going to get the keys dont know nothing about no gun
course you dont
tell me something darrell
forty thousand people die every day
how come none of them are you
darrell throws him the keys i think you know where to find her
and the trunk key
darrell pulls out the trunk key topped off the tank for you
just my way of doing business
bobby jovial confident now listen up good darrell
im getting outta this shithole
and one little peep outta you remember that gun makes you part of the food chain
your prints are all over it
id be awful careful whose rectum i was pointing my finger in darrell
bobby hops in the car a free man
as darrell glares at him bewildered and frightened at the same time
bobby turns the mustang up the drive
the headlights cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where graces jeep had been parked
bobby jumps from the mustang and runs around frantically
his look is devastated
he falls to his knees about to sob when grace opens the front door and pokes her head out putting out several suitcases
what the hells the matter with you
i just stubbed my toe on a rock
hurt like hell
i got the money all packed
i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage
peoplell think maybe me and jake went away
buy us some time
i know a back road we can take
looking at her four bags whats all this
im not coming back
bobby accepting awright lets go
i want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up
funny thing the jeep wouldnt start
i had to push it
bobby dryly funny thing
ill get the bags
bobbys mustang is backed towards the front of the house
we see a silhouette of bobby and grace carrying something wrapped in a blanket and dumping it in the trunk
a lone pair of headlights illuminate the night as the mustang cruises through the dark
as the lights brighten the screen we grace sits next to bobby peering out the windshield clutching the money in a backpack
shes humming an indian song
i cant see it
it should be just up ahead
there it is
a sign illuminated by the headlights
it reads you are grace lets out a scream of joy leans over and hugs him
i cant believe it
im finally out
the mustang begins to swerve along the road
take it easy
want to get us killed
you dont know what it feels like to be free of that place
i dont know about that
you spent a day in superior
i wasted my entire life there
i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders
weve still got some dead weight to get rid of
cant we just dump him fast someplace
i want a place where only the vultures will find him
then itll be over soon grace
then will you take me on your friends boat with you
im not sailing his boat
but i thought were going to buy a boat of our own baby and sail it wherever we want to go
what the hell
where should we go
ive read all about it
ive dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet
id kill to go there
you already have
she gives him a funny look
you know i thought youd left me back there
what are you talking about
bobby emotional when i got back from the garage and your jeep wasnt there i thought youd gone and left me and taken the money
off her look cause i never had any luck with women grace
you dont know what i been through
the shit ive taken
i thought you were like the rest of em
but when you came out of the house
well youre here grace and we might be starting in the shit but were starting where i never been together with someone together with you grace
she responds with a luminous smile
i love you bobby
he looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes
were gonna pull this off grace
just then a headlight rakes them from the rear as we hear again the ominous crackle of a police radio and the short brutal whoop of the siren as sheriff
potters vehicle rolls up quickly behind them
graces face is caught like a surprised deer in the headlamps
oh my god
then dont stop
bobby is in a bind
the siren whoops again
the lights flash to highbeam
he mustve seen us swerving on the road thats all just gonna give us a ticket for swerving
but even bobby has trouble believing that as the police vehicle pulls out sharply alongside his and sheriff potter motions to him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder
sheriff into loudspeaker pull over goddamnit pull over
she seems to be panicking
bobby pulls over
just shut up grace
we done nothing
let me do the talking
he doesnt know anything
his vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them the sheriff gets out shining his power flashlight into their faces
bobby starts evening sheriff sorry bout that but this jackrabbit
bobby has no time to react as the sheriff is suddenly there at his window jerking his door open angry
a gun in his hand pointed at them his eyes on grace
you had to fuck him didnt you
grace nervous cool i would never do that to you baby
he killed jake said hed kill me if i didnt come with him
all he wants is the money
bobby looks at her
he cannot believe what he just heard
sheriff flipping yelling dont lie to me grace knows the jam is up
but he never made me cum
really virgil i was only doing what i had to do so we could be free
just like we talked about
it meant nothing a pause
virgil wants to kill her but he also wants her back badly
you fucking him too grace

she ignores him
her attention on the backpack with the money between her legs the gun is there inside an outer flap of the bag
you fuck this guy get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me
no baby you got it wrong
this road dont go to globe grace where were you going to meet me
his flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat
she doesnt have an answer to that one
its not like that it
look virgil i got the money here
she gets out of the car on her side comes around to him the pack of money slung on her shoulder hard to see in the dark
sheriff hurt oh grace you can say what you want
but i watched you fuck that pervert for years while youre telling me you loved me
what happened to going to milwaukee together

pointing to bobby he did the sheriff deeply wounded casts a hot vicious gaze on bobby

bobby gets out of the car misunderstanding the situation
bobby misunderstanding look we got more
we got at least
split it three ways we all walk away
the sheriff snaps and smashes bobby with his flashlight knocking him to the ground kicking him again and again gathering the psychic force to murder him
grace tries to approach
shut up boy
you dont know shit round here
to grace get back
did she tell you that story about the bird flying away
bobby rolling on the ground ow
sheriff kicking again and again were you going to help her fly away asshole
whatd you think you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to
she tell you the story about old jake forcing her to marry him
thats a good story
how he killed her crazy mama
bobby in bloody agony
grace stunned that virgil would reveal this now publicly
goddamnit virgil stop
but i bet the story she didnt tell you was the best story of all
how old crazy jake was really her papa and she liked fucking papa
and now shes killed the sonufabitch
just like shes gonna kill you
grace plunges into the pack pulls the gun and shoots virgil across the car in the gut
the sheriff flies back onto the road stunned not realizing whats happened
bobby watches unbelieving as grace quietly steps up over the sheriff
she puts the next round in his nuts a modern fury enacting ancient wrath
the sheriff is wide eyed dying in shock
grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head
grace and bobby both stare then grace jumps into action dragging the body
she snaps to bobby
help me get him off the road
into the car
well ditch his car
get the fuck up
bobby stares at her
grace and bobby wordless each thinking in separate worlds
grace wipes her hands
the bag with the money between her legs
the baretta is back in the bag
bobby finally jesus did you have to kill him
get real bobby
he was gonna kill you and me
he was in love with you grace
he wouldve done what you wanted you couldve made a deal and
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jakes murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life
he was a cop grace they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop
he was a scumbag
he wanted me bobby
these guys dont let go
even when theyre dead softer you dont know what it was like bobby
those two they were the same
the oncoming road
so arent you going to ask me

i bet its burning a hole in your brain just now
let it go baby
its the past
i got a past

bobby shouting what do you want me to say
shes yelling emotionally out of control
i was fucking daddy
and i married him
i married him
she looks at bobby forces him to look at her
i dont know why she drops back in her seat
all i wanted was to be a kid
he took that from me
they all did
very quietly dangerously they treated me like meat
a piece of meat
fuck me blow me bend over stick their fingers up my ass fuck them
fuck the whole town
they deserved to die
and us grace
what do we deserve
grace crying quietly to herself nin chonk nin chonk my mama used to say in apache
your worst is doing this to you she said your worst has killed you
and be go tsee you will find out the result of what you have done
just when you think its over when youve gotten away it begins
cause you never get away
bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road
can he still love her
she seems to be reading his thoughts like she said she could
its easy to judge someone else when you dont know nothing about it
im apache bobby
you dont eat what i eat
you dont see what i see
dont judge me
two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through the strangeness of an arizona desert at night
i dont want to think anymore
grace quietly then drive
the lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness
in the vast reaches of a deserted canyon where vultures circle in a hot white sky we find the mustang parked at the edge of a drop
we hear the sound of a body being dragged
nobodys sure where it was heading so fast but the way it hit the semi it wont be getting home now
hey area weather is gonna be hot
just like yesterday
just like every day
some surprise huh
so if youre planning on anything dont you dont like the weather just wait one minute
got any brains get up to alaska and get yourself some trailer park where you dont see no desert for miles and miles
bobby over right there
drop it there
i got it
bobby is giving grace instructions as they drop sheriff virgil potters corpse over a drop onto some rocks yards below
see ya virgil
bobby pushes him over his hand hurting
the body crashes below
its hard work
they head back for the mustang to retrieve jakes body in the popped trunk
but grace notices bobby glancing at the baretta now tucked in her waist
the silence is tense between them the rocks and gravel crunching under their shoes as they walk
grace indicates the gun is this whats bothering you bobby
no grace my hands bothering me
you think now that jakes dead theres all that money there and i dont need you anymore and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and
she pulls an imaginary trigger on bobby mimicking the recoil of a gun
bobby is nervous
dont you think i wouldve done it if i wanted to
what can i do to make you relax baby
you could give me my gun back
why dont we just finish what we started
she stares down at jake
she cant help feeling some old feelings
as bobby walks back to the front of the car turns off the annoying radio
he watches as she softly prays over jake whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled
grace after a moment with jake what do you think happens to someones spirit when they die
i think nothing happens
youre dead meat
you dont believe in anything do you bobby
i believe in this moment thats all
there is nothing else
lifting jake by the shoulder come on
he must weigh pounds
grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his move quickly closing on her when shes off guard
he slams her hard in the face coldly sending her sprawling to the ground dazed
he steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist checks it
she puts her hand to her mouth feels the blood on her finger tips
she looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts into bobby like a knife
you hit me bobby
you hit a woman you motherfucker
didnt your momma ever teach you anything
her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing
her calm is extraordinary as if expecting to die
for a moment bobby does nothing then he slips the gun through his belt
we dump jake we split the money then youre on your own
dont leave me
i want to say with you bobby
so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again
i was just baiting him
bobby i had to tell him that to get his guard down
just like you told jake you was going to kill me
you lied to me all along
lies all lies
your mother your father what story are you on now
how come the town didnt know you was his daughter
grace in pain cause my mom slept around
a lotta men
anybody couldve been my father
but we knew bobby not listening well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me
i wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place
grace screws out i didnt want you to know
bobbys got a headache now
its too much to understand too much talk
too much history has taught him to doubt
when youre finished with me im next
i been there baby
i been there with other cunts
sorry not anymore
ill take you as far as california
if we can make that
after that youre on your own
with all this bread you can live like a queen
i dont want to go to mexico bobby
please i really want to be with you
dont blow this
dont you think i care about you
i think youre a lying back stabbing psycho bitch and one day youll kill me
but its nice to know you cared
the expression on graces face changes as rapidly as the desert weather a coldness passing over and through her
you dont know your own mind
it blocks your heart
keeping a wary eye on grace bobby starts hauling jake out of the trunk
give me a hand
he wrestles jake up to a sitting position
he grabs a can of beer from a warm six pack in the trunk and shoves it into a pocket of jakes coat
poor old jake a few drinks a fight with the sheriff over his wife
and both of em ended up dead
grace takes his boots
time to go for a walk jake
my mother died in this canyon
save the mom routine will ya grace
it doesnt work with me
one two three
they lift the corpse and with great effort haul it towards the edge of the drop
as they pause on the way bobby wary of graces strange coldness tries to soften the blow of separation
look its not so bad we split up
it might be months before they find these guys
if at all
i mean with the mountain lions around here
remember if they cant find no bodies theres no crime
she doesnt respond
well be in phoenix by noon
lose this car get another one
texas mexico are big countries all that money grace youll meet someone else you know theres a lot of hope with a
they lift jake again and move to the edge
hope is a four letter word
but we all need that too
he props jake at the edge standing and transfers the weight onto grace
jakes head is on her shoulder
you make a pretty couple
it seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun wipes it of his prints and slips it through jakes belt
won this in a poker game in reno
god knows who its registered to
you shoulda been more careful jake
see you later
as he takes jakes weight off grace and pushes it over the drop
grace watches him go her eyes shifting to bobby his back momentarily to her also watching
she moves towards him
bobby turns slips on the edge
now all we got to do is try and he feels a blur of motion almost like a bird and he is falling
falling his life coming to an end
grace is standing somewhere up above briefly seen
did she push him
he doesnt know
hes stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of jake and virgil
he screams out in sharp pain
his leg feels broken
but he is alive
grace walks away cutting it all off deeply shaken
she must get away from the past and all these hollow men
she closes the trunk of the mustang gets in the drivers seat reaches for the ignition key
her hand fumbles for it a moment
it isnt there
she sits there
bobby is calling from below
help me grace
we been through too much together
weve only had one day but you and me have been through more than most people ever will
i know you were angry at me and you know you were right
im sorry i hit you
i was wrong about leaving you
you dont belong in mexico
she finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff looks down
i knew you wouldnt leave me grace
are you all right
i busted my leg
can you make it back up
grace in the trunk of my car is a tow rope
it should reach down here
go get it throw it down
of course the trunk is closed
she closed it
bobby the trunk
throw the keys up to me
ill get the rope
bobbys eyes pass over jake a few feet away his eyes staring upwards in death
they take in the gun still attached to his waist
he knows the trunk wasnt locked when they took jake out
i cant throw that far
you got to climb down here and get the keys
you can make it
its the only way grace
grace looks down at the drop
its a tough descent but she knows she could make it and get back up as well
you have to help me
grace takes a look around
she starts down the cliff face
as she descends he talks deliriously
bobby off i knew youd help me
i knew you wouldnt leave me baby cause were tied together too close
we belong together always
grace makes it to the bottom of the drop and walks cautiously towards bobby
grace yelling back echoing bobby
dont flip out on me
i cant do this alone
i know you dont trust me but you gotta pull yourself together im not gonna leave you
i never wanted it to go down like this
it was different with you bobby
you had dreams like me
i wouldve gone anywhere with you bobby
we can make this work
i really am
i didnt wanna hurt you
can he believe her
she sounds so sincere this time
shes heading for the body of jake
and the gun
bobby knows that and is already crawling there
bobby as he crawls theyre right here grace
come get me out of here
know why else i could never leave you
cause i love you
they meet at the apex of jakes corpse
and i love you too
and loves a funny thing
sometimes i dont know if i want to love you
grace leans close to bobby
he dangles the keys out in front of her but she doesnt reach for them
her eyes go to bobby
she reaches for him
at that instant bobbys hands shoot out and clamp hard around her
a sharp gurgle is all that escapes grace as bobby twists the life from her as jake leers up at them
or kill you grace twists and flails in bobbys hands but in spite of his bleeding stump he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly
i love you grace but i just cant trust you she looks at him trying to protest shaking her head
graces flailing goes into overdrive
somewhere in his semi delirious state bobbys eyes might notice the gun at jakes waist is no longer there
grace manages one word jake he cant help you now honey
bobby is in agony as he kills her part beast part lover he kills that which he loves
suddenly a shot is heard
bobby buckles with the blast hit in the side
he kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his hands breaking her neck
bobby looks down at jakes gun which she clutches in her hand and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows from it
he manages to stand looks at jake their bodies lying side by side
bobby with great difficulty claws his way back up the rocks to the car his fast flowing wound staining the white rocks with blood
he makes it to the top and losing more blood climbs into the drivers seat
he checks the money in the bag
as he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side the vultures circle
perhaps one smarter than the others lands close by
it spooks bobby but hes okay
he looks in the mirror
youre still lucky
he puts the key in the ignition the engine comes to life
bobby waves back adios suddenly the radiator hose darrell installed blows apart loudly
bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood
he shakes his head frustrated
bobby sighs oh shit
he cant help but laugh at his bad luck
as we rise off the desert floor and take flight with the vultures eventually leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of arizona
