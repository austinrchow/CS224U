crawford cont d howd she get next to you
she gave me her baby
she threw a punch at a man on the team
well you know that happens on the street
what is that supposed to mean
i think its meaning is clear
what youre saying she was overwrought
that could be
because thats understandable because
she blew the raid
she was there alone sir she was in a burning building waiting for your folks to come through the wall
one moment im not done with you
give him the file
i thought it was going to go down the line to
no no no i want the girl to do it
of the apprehension of hannibal lechter
here we have a wanted poster
guide contd offered by an unnamed source three million dollars for information leading to the apprehension of hannibal lechter
it is of course a bounty poster the only one of its kind it was never distributed the contact number was disconnected and the trail of the person offering the
reward was covered so skillfully that
would you be so kind
of the hannibal lechter case
lechter is as you know still at large
here we see the implements used in his escape from prison
if you will turn to your course syllabus page
a lovely perfume
glad you like it
lechters left hand
his left hand which had a sixth vestigial fully formed sixth finger
you would think that a man with a mark so easily identifiable would
guide contd and speaking of the lechter case
guide contd and speaking of the lechter case i would like to complete our tour of the gallery with three other instances of criminals still at large
to complete our tour and
oh and to complete your course of study by
your girls a menace
here givver this getter off the street and teach her some humility i dont think so
well then you have insufficient information
im grateful for this opportunity to set you straight
krendler contd yeah get on to your sea daddy starling
old as you are
aint you ashamed still lookin for your pappy
what has he got against you

because he sent me in there to be killed
what is this
whats he got against you
he once made me an improper suggestion
big man little man
fair fight the good big mans gonna win
but we dont mean to send you out there to fight fair
brigham contd and in a gunfight what just happened to the big man
hes at a disadvantage
inney brigham contd stand up
big man now hes just a bigger target
lets turn it around
pull your sidearm
brigham contd now an arrest
you aim to shoot me or you just playing show and tell
you dont want to shoot me you just deprived yourself of one of your hands
you fool i got two hands you got one so whats the gun good for
its good for control you can control through force but you can also control through
brigham contd misdirection misdirection my friend
youre pointing a gun at me looking in the othdirection who the hell do you think that you went into police work to control your rage
well that would be a poor choice wouldnt it
tell me why
im sorry i dont mean to be impolite
because you know you cant understand
then tell me
well you know you know you know the point is i cant tell you
cause you havent been there
you havent done it and thats all there is and to have done it means can mean to accept not only danger but betrayal thats right
and humiliation what is this new job theyve
thats all part of it
then that being so why is today special
why have you come back to see me
is it that new file they gave you
i dont think so
then what brings you back
i dont know
do you know
i think i do i think it is a phrase you used with that woman
you told her you were an orphan you used to your mind your most private fears
you called up memories of your father to
barter with her
to appeal to her and you feel that
no i dont think so
it is you who have betrayed
it is not they who
i appreciate your help but
you want another drink honey
i want the same drink
cause it did me good but i already drunk it so barring that yes i would like another
starling contd bcause its one of the few things in the world which are effective anpredictable
whats that baby
where both its life enhancing and its life destroying qualities
not unlike some hindu god i guess the only thing is suck it up
truer words were never spoken
our mister frendler to to to humiliate me though
what elses he goin to do with his day he cant work and he wont steal
oh baby oh baby
bad beat today
hey im fine
whaddizit you hows your day our gallant international neighbors
look what they put her on
no that is code word material thats what that is
they got her cleaning out the privvies
what does this mean

lechter come up for sale
whys she chasingem down
find out is he sellingem he needs the money orizzey buying them fold times sake
the mans long gone hes not coming back buy up a drawing no but that is the will of the institution to instill a proper probity humility deference in the
could i does this jackal krendler trine a shame her cause they botched the raid
ni dont care you see what all they got me doin for id rather be doin makework than be doin publrelations with the dirty dozen one hispanic one librarian one
jew and one from column a and one from column
no yknow i never doubted it
you were kind enough today to take my photograph
well thats you see what i am kind and feeling
you should get married
thats what i should do
tell me why
because baby youre looking to find love in an institution thats your only chance
yeah but who would marry friendless me howabout you romeo
sadly hey lost again
but perhaps there is some some less radical solution
im sure there is but my young friend here would kill you
his feelings do him honor
and i have come simply to pay my respects to the great clarice starling
the great and beautiful is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt that the stars are far that
no i get it this is my cavalier this gents my italian knight
take this for this shall be my gage and you can take it into battle
or clear your windshield with it
what a lovely perfume
waal you cn only get it in one shop in alexandria virginia nthats where im going cause im goin home fi can get nyone of that nature to take her
all ygot to do is ask this one is my favorite
it has not title
they should call it fetch whaddaya think
i know it well
what does that mean
it is a gravestone in the cemetery of in my native florence
yeah we got all sort of funeray sculpture here i guess they mean statues in graveyards
brazil the tomb of karl marx london heres one in scandinavia
florence as you may not know is famed for
yeah im sure its famed for lotsa things and youre oneathem
but this particular statue
waal you hold fast to that thought as im sure thats a clue
this is perhaps an inappropriate time but i would like to say it is an honor to meet the woman who solved the celebrated hannibal lechter
i dint solve it i didnt solve it just sat a dance out with him
facts facts facts
facts close the case cavalier
a case so so fascinating so
it was all of that son
what makes a man
what makes him
eat human flesh
yeah well they solved that turns out heuz a cannibal showm the fbi hand shake
i am no going to show you the secret handshake cmon pal im gone to buy you a drink
yeah well its a raw wound innit youre gonna bump it every time you turn around
but you know what the trick is
not to turn around
you want to get married
you tol me you wuunt ask me again til im ready
youre ready now
thats what you think
starling contd hey now what was i afraid of
im shooting at shadows is that what youre afraid of
then you tell me then
you want me to solve all your problems tonight
i feel theyre out to get me
and who is they
theyre sending me
out to get shot
the whole worlds out to get you
how crazy is that
well you wanna shoot back it give you a big target how crazy is that
special agent clarice starling to see mason verger
agent starling would you come with me
theyre from baltimore
ive never heard that he
its not something he wants to publicize maam
its just something he does
i wont take much of his time
hes glad to help
its just a question of his physical condition
cordell contd yget enough breakfast rosie
arent they beautiful miss starling
verger contd well now you see one of thems hurt
and what will make it better
isnt that odd
he thinks hes hurt his knee but the assurance the assurance the assurance that someone cares suggests the hurt was elsewhere mr
verger thank you for your time
for the worst hurt of course that which will not heal is the conviction no one cares
ive come to see you sir about an auction
ah yes ah yes
our doctor lechter
and have they sent you once again to capture him
how terrible for you
no sir its not my job to capt
why do you say how terrible
because we must leave the past in the past
wheeze wheeze ah
and here we have artifacts of yes my own encounter with him
verger contd no no
lechters drawings of me
before and of course after now you are not sent to pursue him
then your visit baffles me
sir various drawings done by dr
lechter while in prison stolen from the prison after his escape have surfaced and are being sold at auction
several large reserve bids have been placed on them
i have to ask if youve placed those bids
because if it was not you then perhaps it was dr
lechter trying to reclaim his own property
and why would you suspect me of this ghoulishness
because sir you are the only one of his victims who lived
and because you have large resources
large resources starling which i prefer to devote elsewhere
due respect sir
starling contd due respect after your after your
someone offered three million dollars bounty on dr
the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established
yes but we know who it was and i will tell you agent starling what you know to be true
i offered the bounty
it was illegal and worse it was wrong and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder
do you wheeze agent starling do you know god sir
isnt it funny
you can look on my face wheeze wheeze which you would grant me is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life
you can look at me
which shows wheeze a strength which must come from strong wheeze strong convictions
wheeze but you shy when i say the name of god
yes then youre saying that you havent bid upon these drawings
i have not i would not for life wheeze life goes on starling
and wait wait i wish to talk to you
wheeze to the nurse who is taking starlings arm one moment
i was afflicted do you see but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr
i was afflicted before
do you see
in my arrogance
do not wheeze do not curse god when you are humiliated
listen to me embrace it and you embrace life listen and you hear the word of god will he be alright
verger wanted me to give you this
cordell contd and he has asked me to ask you something
what would that be
would consider it a favor if he could make a donation to a charitable institution of your choice
now why in the world would he do that
he was touched by your reaction
to his appearance
please i do not
i dont want to trouble him
but if you or he have any notlon who would be buying dr
do you know the seller weve subpoenaed the auction houses records
try barney clark
he was the orderly during dr
lechters stay in prison
and how would you know that
before the change mr
he made quite a study
you should get the kids a dog i hardly think so
after the incident
no no of course not
verger would be pleased to make a contribution to the charitable
tell him to give it to an orphanage
that you could go beyond the institution
what does that mean
i saw a man today a man so hideously deformed wholl spend his life in a hospital bbb
yes so you said
but what does that mean to go beyond the institution
if he could overcome
his need for
for self ratification would you use a small word
whats wrong with approval
you admired that man
how do you think that made him feel
what does that mean to go beyond the institution
i told that woman im an orphan
you are an orphan
youre right used it
to bargain for her sympathy used it to whore myself out welcome to the human race
do you know there are people who admire you
why dont you find them
ysee john brigham
look at this you seen john brigham
this just came in over the transom
fella works for a plastic surgeon argentina
look here whatm i looking at
a fellow with five fingers
not for our doctor lechter
purports to be an x ray of the hand of a
after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit
it purports to be the x ray of dr
am i on that case sir
well then i wouldnt want to be taken for a hobbyist agent brigham is in the library
this isnt signed hard up as you are at your age
whadda you care

brigham contd why you know what hes right
fella had his life taken from him by a maniac
hes laying there hell never get off that bed
he cant move a monster a monster fed his face to the dogs nhe said that it saved his life
hes spendn his life helping children
how corny is that
but you know what i give up
lets get married and spoil a buncha kids
starling they got a x ray

wherever he is thats fine with me they

and it seems tove left a scar uh oh
that aint my case
they assigned me go do some legwork theft of government property
thas what im gonna do and then go home and burn the roast
how the hell about that im gonna swim with the current and i dont care where he is

shouldnt that be carried out in depth
i have to get back to my wife
pazzi contd whats up
how was america
bad coffee and women with excessive ankles
doctore carlo fanelli curator of the pallazo capponi months missing

somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information so on
they got that kind of money
their family owns

whats the rush
arent you glad to see me

what did you bring me
anna contd and
i brought you my passion and my wish that this afternoon will be for you an experience of ecstasy
pazzi contd what
i cant think
you dont have to think
we have to talk about money im on the track of a reward which
im going to tell you later
a reward for what
some museum director disappeared
you havent found him yet
what is this a whorehouse or are you my wife youve gone off to america on your vacation i was working please swear to you
and i want to talk to you about your promotion yes
my promotion i want to talk to you about your salary because i cant
pazzi contd need you yunderstand i need you
everybody needs something hold up a minute
you spend the afternoon in bed
first things first
you take this much time over everything
thats why my wife adores me
carlo fanelli dottore missing two months
he was the director of the museum
which since his absence
how was america
ricci contd we may need you to stop bloodshed
whatre they on about
theyre grilling the applicant for the vacant post
speaking of the vacant post
he hasnt by any chance wandered back in now our applicant holds in his hand in his non italian hand a note from dante aligheri himself
would he recognize it i think not you want the job for your nephew
indeed i do
because he is my nephew
let him read the note
yes fine of course he can read the note
his italian is admirable for a straniero but is he familiar with
sogliato contd the personalities of pre renaissance florence
i think not a dr
a brazilian i think
applying for fanellis post
it would seem
what if he came upon a note in the capponi library this great italian institution which he now graces us with his bid to direct a note from guido de
would he recognize it i think not
sogliato contd would you care to address that dr
cavalcanti replied publicly to dantes first sonnet
do you know it professor sogliato
i believe its worth your time listen to the way he makes an instrument of the italian vernacular which he called the vulgari eloquentia the eloquent voice of the people
allegro me sembrava amor tenedo meo core in mano e ne la braccia avea madonna involta in un drappa dormedo poi la svegliava a desto ardeno lei paventosa umilmente pascea appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo
if dante had written to a cavalcanti it would of course have been to andrea the most literary of his brothers
why do you want this job
in the hope that someday i should come across such a note
i thank you gentleman for your kind attention and hope you will consider
investigating the disappearance of dottore fanelli
who can you think who would want to harm dr
fanelli did he have any enemies that
i have never met a man who was so well beloved
he was wealthy he had nothing
he lived in a garret
his work was his life he
his family has offered a large reward
his older brother offers the reward fanelli had nothing he
committee member contd will have of course to be examined by the studiolo to confirm the appointment but i think i can assure you that the committee
you are most kind
who would benefit from his disappearance
no one has but lost by it
would you excuse me
will have to face the studiolo in their meeting next week
and i for one wish you the best
pazzi contd pazzi rinaldo commendatore prefatura
of course commendatore
could you tell me did you ever meet your predecessor dottore fanelli
i never met him
i knew him only from his writings
i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note a farewell note a suicide note
you have taken over his offices is that not so
it is only temporary until my confirmation by
of course in his offices if you come across anything any personal papers of his anything however trivial would you contact me please
are his personal effects still at the palazzo
packed and with an inventory
ill have them picked up
pazzi contd may we drop you
thank you i am most happy to walk in this most magnificent of cities
may i ask you a personal question dr
if your duty requires it
you have a recent scar on the back of your hand
and you have a new wedding ring on yours
la vita nuova you looked oddly at me back on the landing
yes it must be hard to be a policeman
is it hard
must one then be constantly suspicious
why did you look at me that way
i saw a man in disheveled clothing but clean just dressed in the middle of the
i saw a man somewhat fatigued quickly dressed a bit dishevelled
in the middle of the day
an old story
and then i saw the clothing was fresh therefore a man who dressed at home and then i remarked the new wedding ring
and so the story gave me pause
a lovely story
a new and a beloved wife i wish you joy
you assemble this on the instant from these few observations
im a historian
it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious
your scar my scar is a war wound
carpal tunnel syndrome
from a life of typing
history a hazardous profession
fell contd you are a pazzi of the pazzim are you not
how did you know
you resemble a figure from the della robia rondels in your familys chapel at santa croce
it was adresa de pazzi depicted as john the baptist
you have seen the chapel
i have had the honor
fell contd wondered that an officer of your exalted rank should come so late into the case
i wonder no longer
you were out of the country
how could you know
sense the faintest whiff of a perfume whose base whose base whose base is hamamelis
it is witch hazel such a clean scent
no not a european scent
i would say it is a scent of the new world
i would say you have been in america
have i struck home
you know america
you have brought this perfume
brought this perfume
back from america
to your new wife
you have given it to her and some of
some of her perfume has found its way back onto you
lucky man indeed
should you come across anything which
you will be the first i call
are you attracted by death
it is the one great mystery is it not
anyone who would say otherwise must be a hypocrite
dont you think
barney contd or are you only attracted by power how are you agent starling
ah barney youve got a good mernory
you know why that is
because there are so few things i need to forget
would you agree for the record that i have not been read my rights
i have not read you your rights
would you mind saying that into your bag
i hereby acknowledge that
and now i have dociled you have i not
by forcing your obedience
then why did you chose to inform me of it
to show in my ability to squander what one might deem an advantage that my strength is greater than yours oh yeah
wanna arm wrestle
if youll come down the street i will make you a cup of coffee
you almost took down evelda drumgo
word gets around
what hindered you
it wasnt my day
perhaps you did not have the support you required
its a poor workman who blames his tools
how are things at the hospital
its a growth business
what have they got you doing
i would have figured you an r
by now or maybe med school
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions
you lasted eight years as orderly in dr
lechters prison ward
yes i presumed it was about him
im struck by your phraseology
i did not last with him
i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time
im looking for
he said and these were his words he valued our time together because i was civil
did you ever think did you think after he escaped he would come after you
he told me he preferred to eat the rude
or natural composting
do you think hed come after you what
i asked you how you like your coffee
we have black and bitter
as the soul of man
or light and sweet as the world view of the self delusive
we got a bunch of materials coming up at auction
materials which disappeared from dr
lechters cell drawings he made his books yes
and id like your help determining whos bidding for their purchase
waal because your selling em
two years ago his annotated dictionary of cuisine by alexander dumas went for sixteen thousand dollars
sellers affidavit of ownership signed cary panz
sounds to me like an orderly
whadja clear on the book
ten twelve grand
heres what they want you to do we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell
lets just say they got a passion for collectibles
you said heres what they want you to do
now whynt you help us
that would adversely impact my income
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property or for failure to pay income tax on undisclosed income
we could skip the gavotte
say it in english
lechters not buying up his memorabilia
he keeps it all in his mind do you see
then whos buying it
theres one or two freaks and for a pass ill rat them out to you
thats the spirit
arent you afraid of me
you want me to be
id prefer it
but its just a vacant exercise
a vacant exercise why you said heres what they want you to do
arent you part of them anymore
arent you part of the fbi
no girls allowed or what have you transgressed
lets keep it to business shall we
why have they stuck you on this silly little roust
they did it for a lark
the ornithological leitmotif
barney contd off you go
youve grieved enough
anything more would be self indulgence
who are these guys
rich comic book freaks
and why is it a vacant exercise
because we both know whos buying the lechteriana
who would that be
for he cannot be free
lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul what an impossible injustice
can you be free
no youre wrong about verger
hes found peace
well if he hasnt im vastly mistaken
and have you found peace
whatll you do with the bird
pluck it and eat it
it was so good to see you
how you doin
mi gonna see you tonight
then im doing fine
whats new onna street
all quiet along the potomac
starling contd can we run this guy down
who is he
his job description
hes a comic book freak
whadda we want him for
just get me his vital signs will you
which would of necessity have left this scar in the shape of the number
why a three
it requires two flaps to close the area between the
starling come look at this did you see this
yes sir i saw it
we have a memo here from your friend mr
krendler at the justice department
i am all attention
he requests your presence once again as part of
just the person im looking for
and why would that be
because youre going to help me plan a party
youre going to do that
im going to do it and youre going to catch the bouquet
the multi jurisdiction task force read alphabet soup for the continued pursuit and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive evelda drumgo
the mans hazing you
my daddy would say accept with glee the things you cannot change
ill tell you what i should go in there volunteer to fill up his female quota
crawford asked my opinion
here weve got a purported x ray dr

yeah thats too hip for the room
you stay offa this alphabet soup detail all this half baked cowboy stuff till after you get your mind cleared
you dont wanna go out there a half step slow i dont wanna go out there at all what do you want to do
you want to jam up that sonofabitch krendler
i want to buy a dog
what broke you free girl
i met a man and his troubles were greater than mine
and age appropriate large and small motor skills
his unfortunate home situation has made it necessary for franklin to form immediate attachments with adults which we understand to have contributed to many instances of his abuse
are you franklin
where do you live
with mama and shirley and stringbean
franklin contd but stringbean he in and out
in and out
and mama is not your real mama is she franklin
she my foster
shes not the first foster that youve had
do you like it at your home franklin
we got kittykat
and shirly let me sleep with her sometime
franklin you cant live there anymore
with mama and shirly and kittykat
you have to go away
the government says
mama has lost her job so she cant be your foster mother
the police found a marijuana cigarette in your home
you cant see mama anymore
or kitty cat
thats what the government says
verger contd or perhaps they just dont want you anymore
could that be
and do you know what will happen to kitty cat
when you go away
the police will take her and theyll give her a shot
with a shiny needle
theyll give kitty cat a shot
and it will hurt her
and then she will die
verger contd come here
do you know how you keep kittycat from getting a shot
do you know
then come here verger contd you can keep kitty cat from getting a shot if verger contd if you give him this verger contd you can keep her from getting
the shot if you give her that rat poison yourself
verger contd goodbye franklin
verger contd remember what we talked about
verger contd no im fine
verger contd what have we heard from our friend at the fbi
most current information shows the result of an operation for the removal of a sixth digit the left hand of a man
can we identify it as dr
not with any certainty we
why did he come back
our operatives in brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of
are you alright sir
he turned back into the room

thats all we have time for today
i dont understand
you said that you have decided
your feelings of persecution as you put it are a self indulgence and you are going to put them aside
and get on with your job
and you have decided to accept
to accept this emotion as you put it to the
of the lechter case
and youve decided to get married youve decided a lot of things
but in spite of your decisions you are still nagged by feelings of despair of failure of
you still have the nightmare you
what is your point
that if decision were a useful tool you wouldnt be here
why are you here
i want to do something positive you want some advice yes
your life has been defined by institutions

phenomenal capacity for languages

this hyper charm sudonis et al psychopathology of the serial killer is most pronounced in
knowledge of the italian renaissance with a particular emphasis on architecture see lechter the artist and literature
during his first recorded incarceration he confounded the prison psychiatrist by quoting dante on
apartment was untouched showing no signs of his departure hurried or otherwise
note his housekeeper did testify that all the condiments had been removed from the kitchen but this was discounted as fanciful and
commendatore if youre looking for opera tickets

the girl needs help

i hope youll find it so
its good to see you regaining your strength
thanks to you now what were we last speaking of
we were speaking of my father im sorry
we were speaking of my father indeed we were
and my need for the institution
freud do you know
freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon
and how did he do that
he saw the truth and spoke it
im afraid this wine is making me woozy
you have to eat lechter contd youve sought out the institution all your life as you with it to replace your father
this is obvious
less obvious is this that you require the institution not to support you but to lechter contd as this keeps your father alive the truth is two fold and the
truth is one lechter contd that every man is fallible that every institution being made of men cannot but be corrupt
lechter contd the only art in this dish of course is that it must be fresh lechter contd that the institution cannot but be corrupt and therefore it cannot be
but an act of complicity to seek to appease it
lechter contd so many civilizations eat their slain enemies
what do you think
how much better to devour a person physically than to devour his spirit
which is of course the purpose of the institution
lechter contd and that is the especial surprise ive prepared for you
i feel weak
you must eat
dont understand the gift of course is not the meal but the identification which of us does not need help
the identity of your true enemy
for you always sought to befriend to wish the love of those who wished you ill
lechter contd come here he is in no pain there are no nerves in the brain come here come here im going to cure you
lechter contd oh no
theyve put a beeper on you
how careless of me
how finally careless do you think
have i erred on purpose
or am i just unlucky
could one not say thats the essential question of philosophy
might i have some more of the wine
starling contd because i find i like the effects
you may say that its inebriation but it seems this lovely evening in particular
it seems to reward me with clarity starling contd or perhaps it is just the heat was just saying to the doctor starling contd but do you know do you
know im not feeling altogether
ive got her
may be the heat
lets get her out of here
but as my father used to say
thats why its a stone you know it means dont come back
he cant come back
baby thats the beginning of wisdom
give me your gun
what mapp contd what what did you say
