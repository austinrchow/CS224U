written by dan kay all revisions written by tony giglio september close on a young womans eye
her eyelashes tremble
a tear rolls out
close on a filthy coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth
close on the same type rope binds her ankles together
close on her hands a mixture of blood dirt
iron spikes from above the young woman s wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart lies nailed to a wooden table
curdling scream cries out
the young womans breathing intensifies
she watches the light bulb listens to the screams
the light bulb returns to normal
the screams stop
peace for a moment
but she knows that wont last
a young man s hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling
hes bloodied bruised
close on the end of a pair of jumper cables
they touch sending sparks into the air
brought together by
a concealed figure
all thats visible are his hands
his left hand is severely burned scarred while his right appears normal
he touches the jumper cables together again
please please stop
the concealed figure ignores his pleas connects the left cable to one shackle chain
and then the right side
the lights dim and crackle
close on the light bulb dulls
the screams of the young man echo through the room
the young woman closes her eyes
takes several fast breaths then
musters every ounce of strength in her body and
her right hand trembles
the young woman grimaces in unbelievable agony but then
her right hand inches up the iron spike
slowly and painfully
pieces of blood skin and bone cling to spike as the hand moves up
the light bulb returns again to normal
the screams stop
the young woman gives a final hard push and
frees her right hand
blood pours from the wound
no time to waste
she turns her attention strength to her left hand
ever so slowly and painfully it moves
close on the jumper cable attaches to the metal and
electricity surges through the young mans body
the young womans left hand pops free
blood oozes out
she sits up goes for the gag but her fingers cramp in pain
finally she unties the knot removes the gag
she coughs tries to muffle the noise best she can
the screams stop
lights return to normal
half way free
she goes for the ropes at her ankles unties them slides off the table
she grabs a couple rags ties them around her palms wounds
the young woman opens the door checks to see if the coast is clear
were at the end of a long dark hallway more like a tunnel really
there are two more doors in the hall one in front of her another to her right
the door across from her is slightly ajar
young womans pov thru door the young man dangles from the chains
suddenly the concealed figure appears between the door and the young man
the young woman retreats but realizes the concealed figure has his back to her
the young man sees past the figure locks eyes with the young woman
no hope for himself his eyes say save yourself
the young woman fights back tears mouths the words i love you
she carefully opens the door to her right reveal a rickety set of wooden steps
she heads up just as
off screen the young man screams again
the young woman quickens her pace
the screams drown out any sound until
just before she touches the top step
the lights return to normal
the young man stops screaming
the place goes silent
the young womans foot touches the step
a loud creak rings out
the young woman freezes
the concealed figure turns towards the sound
the young woman holds her breath
did he hear her
a steel axe sickle hybrid a scary handmade invention rusted save for the razor sharp edge sticks in a nearby wooden horse
the concealed figure snatches the weapon
sarah young woman bolts up the remaining steps
the concealed figure rushes for the door
sarah races through the thick forest
her bare bloody feet and legs stomping over the hard dirt branches shrubs anything in her way
not too far behind
the concealed figure
the majority of him still hidden follows her
weapon in hand
pushes through some thick brush but
she screams in pain grabs her foot notices
a large gash across the bottom
sarah turns hears
the concealed figure
approaches in the distance
wills herself up limp runs away
sarah exits the thick woods to discover to her horror
she stands at the edge of a cliff takes a peek over the side
sarahs pov jagged rocks and a small stream at the bottom feet below
a waterfall flows steadily nearby
before sarah can fully digest the situation
the concealed figure exits the forest spins the weapon in his hand
anticipating its use
sarah freezes in her spot
breaths get shorter heavier
her eyes dart in every direction
what to do
the concealed figure takes one step forward and
sarah jumps off the cliff
rather that fate than the other
the concealed figure walks up to the edge looks over
at the bottom
sarahs dead body lays twisted and bloody among the rocks
the waterfall crashes next to her
blood mixes with the water turning it a deep red
a black four door vw passat cruises the interstate
a gortex duffel is strapped to the roof
mike warren late s with a devilish grin and looks to kill sits at the wheel
even a flashy pair of sunglasses cant mask the twinkle in his eye
sheryl james late s rides shotgun
this beautys got it all toned bod sharp mind and a heart stopping smile
an opened bag of chips sit in her lap
a couple of diet cokes in the cup holders
she cradles a cellphone mp player

sheryl hits the play button
warning shots thievery corporation
sheryl rolls her eyes
sheryl scrolls again hits play
bullets by the editors
mike grins and shoots her a wink
you loaded these songs
you dont need to be so impressed with yourself
i know i dont have to be
i havent even heard of half these bands
its called good music
you should try to familiarize yourself with it instead of listening to the crap you do
i listen to crap
hurts me to be the one to tell you
im sure it does
you gotta be more like me baby
think new fresh cutting edge
im looking for the next beatles u or radiohead
sheryl scans through the mp player spots one and smiles
so where does this band fall into that group
the music starts
boys dont cry i want to be a cowboy blares
fresh new or cutting edge
mike immediately begins to backtrack
howd that get on there
you loaded the songs
you tell me
must be a mistake
says here youve listened to it times
is this true
have you always wanted to be a cowboy
sheryl spies more
you also got men without hats greatest hits
i didnt know they qualified for a greatest hits album
can you break me off a little safety dance
mike reaches for the mp player
okay give me that
the passat speeds past a west virginia state sign
the sun burns above
the passat turns into the park
the passat rolls into a dirt parking lot
next to the lot is the ranger station
maps and local artifacts adorn the walls
a display of some of the local animals stuffed of course including a giant bear fill in the gaps
mike and sheryl enter
they take in the place
mike heads toward the rangers desk while sheryl eyes the decor
sam a round faced ranger with a grumpy disposition a hearing aid in his right ear sits behind a desk
he continues working scribbling on something as sheryl and mike wait
sam holds up a wait a second finger
after a beat
now what can i do you two for
sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board
hiking gear for sale tour info national park history etc
first time here and youre not quite sure where to begin
sheryl grabs a national park information flier
angle on there are pictures an emergency contact information guided tour info etc
something like that
precisely like that
sam stands grabs his lower back a recurring discomfort
as he digs around for something
sheryl notices on the board
angle on a flier for a young missing couple
angle on a photo of a girl sarah travers from the opening scene
sheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms with mike at the desk
get you started with one of these
sam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple
how long you folks hiking for
heading out early sunday
well if you move at a decent clip you could hit the summit by midday tomorrow
should still give you time to take it all in and make it down
any particular path
you folks experienced hikers
weve done some ah interrupting no
nothing like this
for first timers i recommend either willow creek bridge or donner trail
as in the donner party
im not sure of the names origin
theyre the two paths we regularly patrol
something happens and youre on one of the other trails it might be awhile before we find you
where do we camp
unless it says not to you can set up where you like
just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire
oh and this heres bear country
theyre not animals to fool with
you see one you head the other way especially if hes feeding
if the bear thinks youre getting in the way of his food thats all she wrote
sheryl warily eyes the stuffed bear in the station
you got yourself a first aid kit
nurse betty heres my first aid kit
sam looks confused
dont mind him
im a nurse
good for you
the question was do you have a first aid kit
yes we have a first aid kit
great see how easy that was
moving on its off season parks pretty quiet
even more than usual
you may run into a few locals but people live up here
we have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home
most of em are friendly
respect their land and theyll respect you
mike twangs and air banjos dueling banjos from deliverance
sam is not amused
sheryl fights her temptation to laugh
moving on base is just outside to the left
at about two miles up therell be a junction where you can pick your path
mike and sheryl offer a smile and quickly exit
mike and sheryl exit
they burst out laughing
mike digs through his backpack double checking everything
what he doesnt show sheryl
wrapped in some socks a
he tucks it discreetly away
sheryl checks her bag as well
she clips a blue hikers towel to her waist
mike checks his cell phone
you getting anything
sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head no
ill lock them in the car
ill take mine
just to annoy you
in an emergency id rather have a phone that may not work up there than not have a phone that may work up there
mike shakes his head puts his phone in the glove compartment
sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack
zips it shut
angle on mikes keys and his boston red sox key chain
mike locks the door
okay we all set
lets do this
mike pulls on his backpack starts walking
sheryl doesnt move
she eyes their tent still resting on the cars roof
what do you think leave the tent or maybe take it with us
mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car
i was just seeing if you were paying attention
mike comes back to the car for the tent
sheryl shakes her head and smiles
the mountain is breathtaking
nature at its best
mike and sheryl have begun their ascent
it could be fun
not a chance
high school reunions serve only two purposes
to try to
mike contd rehash so called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich banging a super model
so what were you
i was a stoner
so what does that mean
how the hell am i supposed to remember
i was high all the time
sheryl swallows some water checks her compass
sweat rolls down mikes forehead stinging his eyes
sheryl doesnt have that problem
shes wearing a red bandana
whered you get that bandana
its cute right
i stopped by that army navy store on grover yesterday
keeps the sweat out of your eyes
and when you were buying it you didnt think that maybe
it was the last one
the last one
the entire army navy store
there was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute
sheryl stifles a chuckle
mike shakes his head then
she pulls out a gray bandana hands it to him
you big baby
sheryl turns as she does
mike pinches her behind she playfully shrieks hustles away from him but he pursues her as they both crack up they spill off the trail
off the path
mike and sheryl continue their horseplay when
sheryl looks down screams
a bloody mutilated fox lays inside a rusted bear trap
the steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two
the kill looks fresh
what is it
looks like its a or was a fox
mike and sheryl head back to the path
angle on the mutilated bloody fox
mike and sheryl hike over a small wooden bridge
mike and sheryl reach a small clearing
there are a number of signs pointing toward different trails
donner trail willow creek bridge timber falls etc
sheryl grabs the map and some water
mike swigs some water munches on trail mix takes a peek in the guidebook
what do you think
cannibal trail or the other one
guidebook says a couple of these other trails lead to some pretty sweet views
were not lewis and or clark
were gonna stick to one of the ones the ranger said
you folks need some help
ida foster s approaches wheeling some supplies in a handmade wagon
she is worn haggard but has a friendly smile
she wears a flannel shirt old jeans and dirty boots
were just going over our options here
well take it from me any way you choose you cant go wrong
the ranger at base suggested donner trail or
willow creek bridge
i think sam only knows those two trails
between those id pick donner trail
willow creek will shoot you to the top but theres not as much to see
donner weaves through peddlers point its a better hike and prettier all around view
to mike what do you think
then she notices a ring on sheryls finger
thats a pretty ring
not your traditional wedding ring but its all the same in the lords eyes
how long have you two been wed
sheryl and mike trade looks
were not married
not yet anyway
mike shoots her a look not yet
its a ring my father gave me for graduation
embarrassed oh im sorry
you just looked like you was married isall
both so beautiful
beat im just an old fashioned silly bird
i need to mind my own business
no its fine
changing topics which one of those trails got the best clearings
neither will give you much in the way of clearings
but theres another path this one here
points to the map timber falls
its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls youll ever see
to sheryl yeah
well ill leave you to it
last thing you need is me fussinground you taking you from your private time
yeah thanks for the tip
ida walks off but stops only a few feet away
im just gonna say it and go but if you two were to marry
i bet the lord would bless you with a happy healthy and handsome child
good luck and god bless you both
sheryl and mike dont know how to respond
once out of earshot
i suddenly feel the need for confession
still lingering on
love taking your shots dont ya
sheryl shoots him a stern but playfully sexy look
when i see an opening
checks map that path she was talking about winds through these falls
what do you think
if you get eaten by a bear and there isnt a ranger around im not carrying whats left of you down this mountain
and they say romance is dead
smiling wide timber falls it is
they throw on their backpacks and head on their way
whos lewis and or clark
you really were stoned through high school
as mike and sheryl trek up the path
angle on the directional sign timber falls looking back down on the thin path
find sheryl and mike continuing their trek
splinter unit mike maneuvers around a massive tree
gestures for sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words dont move
sheryl stops startled
mike motions towards
a mountain stag with magnificent antlers chews on a plant in the distance
sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera
snaps a photo of the animal
the stag stops chewing and looks at them
after a long beat the stag skips away through the trees
sheryl watches the animal disappear smiles
mike removes his backpack and crosses to sheryl
he helps remove her backpack and kisses her
she kisses him back
angle on sheryls heart shaped locket through her shirt
youre going to lose that out here
i never take it off
not since you gave it to me
betcha dont remember
sheryl stares incredulously romantically at mike
i remember every moment with you
ive got you so whipped
sheryl climbs onto mikes lap
he leans back better positioning places his hand down when
mike brings his hand back up
blood trickles out of a small cut across his palm
something stuck it
sheryl quickly examines the cut
mike quickly becomes flustered woozy
he turns away from the wound
its not too deep
let me get the first aid kit
sheryl rummages through her bag
mike in more psychological discomfort than physical looks away wincing
sheryl returns wipes the blood away best she can
she applies some peroxide
gotta clean the wound baby
from a distance
a sickle blade enters frame pulls a branch aside
sheryl attends to mikes wound
the pov narrows
solely on sheryl
mike looks at sheryl a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes
you know me and blood
we dont do so well
she finishes all done
off screen crunch of something stepping on a thicket
sheryl glances toward the sound
mike admires the dressing of the wound
not bad nightingale
not bad at all
did you hear something
mike follows her eye line
theres a softer crunch
its probably the deer
the deer went in the other direction
mikes demeanor suddenly becomes cold creepy
maybe its someone or something stalking us
something inhuman watching our every move
i said knock it off
something coming for you sheryl
sheryl straps on her backpack
just when i think theres hope for you
youre an asshole
sheryl walks away
this is a joke
youre not really mad are you
she turns the corner and is out of sight
under his breath unbelievable
mikes in disbelief
he grabs his backpack heads after her
he turns the corner looks up but doesnt see her
the path winds like a snake
sheryl wait up
mike moves up the winding path
he stops eyes searching
the path opens up
mike can now see a hundred yards ahead but
no sign of sheryl
calls out sheryl
this isnt funny
two birds scream and fly from their perch overhead
mike eyes the birds then takes off
mikes heart rate increases
he moves quickly up the path a steep incline
he brushes past a bush and stops
lying just off the path
sheryls blue hikers towel
he picks it up
his heart now pounding
mike moving faster
up ahead he stops again finds
mike picks up the bandana
he cuts through some tiny evergreens off the path
mike freezes when he sees
sheryls backpack lies against a tree
a few feet farther along her cut off jean shorts
next to them
but no sheryl until
good old hansel
following the trail of bread crumbs
mike turns to see sheryl lying against a rock wearing just her bra and panties
she smiles at him coyly
mike exhales deeply
relieved but fuming
doesnt feel good to be teased does it
okay he had that coming
he takes her in
shes quite a sight
he sits down next to her
mike breaks the embrace
dont disappear on me again
sheryl mouths the words i promise
crosses her heart
he leans in they kiss again
soft and sweet at first
then it deepens
sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt
they kiss again
harder this time
their hands all over one another
mike slides his hand under sheryls panties between her legs
she moans softly
sheryl unhooks her bra and is about to remove it when hey brody lonnie
check this out
darryl a skinny local with a twisted smile and lonnie s a slob emerge from the forest
they are followed by
brody scruffy and unshaven their ringleader
brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other
looks like we got ourselves a little party
brody and darryl ogle sheryl
she tucks herself behind mike who shifts quickly into protective mode
she snaps her bra back closed
we were just moving our way up the mountain
you were moving your wayround more than just that
sheryl eyes her discarded clothes
darryl spots them too
he grabs the shorts sniffs them
referring to the smell like a peach
mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly
you folks best be careful about what you do up here
never know whos watching
appreciate the advice
i think we learned our lesson
brody nods as he looks them up and down
you city folk aint ya
up from charleston roughing it seeing how the other half lives
no were from virginia just up for a weekend trip
you folks live up here
brody glances at darryl and lonnie then back at mike
its easy to spot the city folk
its like theyre trying to be friendly when really they dont want to be
i think you just startled us is all
sheryl looks over at
lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers rapidly flails it about
well just be on our way
re sheryls shorts may i have those
a bold move from mike
brody concedes gestures to darryl to give the shorts back
darryl reluctantly obliges
mike passes them to sheryl who slides them on
darryl and lonnie soak in every inch of sheryl as she does
mike takes sheryls hand
they make a move but
brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun
where you runnin off to
yeah we just getting acquainted and shit
mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest
he can no longer hide his fear
we just want to get a little further along before the sun sets
darryl eyes the sky
the sun beams down through the trees
plenty of timefore that
we dont want any trouble
we just want to be on our way
and why do you suppose we mean to make trouble
mike looks down at the gun
brody smiles a yellow smile
you folks enjoy the spirits
brody hands darryl the shotgun and drops his sack
brody pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack
why dont you try a taste of this
brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to mike
mike eyes sheryl
clearly she doesnt think its a good idea
mike accepts the jar hesitates then takes a sip
he squirms winces but forces it down
mike turns red and coughs
brody and darryl are loving it
betcha never tasted nuthinlike that
darryl would win that bet
mike has no idea what hes talking about
ill sell you the jar for fifty bucks
ogles sheryl or maybe we could do us a little trade
let me get my wallet
mike opens a zipper on his backpack rummages around
angle on inside the bag
mike thinks about grabbing it
sheryl shocked to see the gun
she tenses up
angle on brody
mike thinks then
fifty bucks sounds like a bargain
to mike pay the man
mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet
he counts out the cash hands it to brody
brody smiles hands the jar to mike
pleasure doing business with ya
take care now
brody nods at mike and sheryl walks off down the trail
darryl grins at sheryl follows brody
should you tire of your present company
just holla and ill come running with bells on darling
he smiles a creepy wide smile
he turns and catches up to the others
once they are out of sight
mike takes a moment to gather himself
sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground puts it on
are you okay
you brought a gun
sheryl picks up her towel and bandana
why did you bring a gun
same reason you brought your cellphone
better to have it and not need it
to protect us
lotta good it just did
sheryl turns from mike walks back to the path
then call out you want to go back
no response sheryl
we should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths
sheryl charges ahead back to the path
under his breath fuck
mike gets up grabs his bag and follows sheryl
the sun begins to set basking the mountain range in a magnificent light
mike and sheryl move right along
still not speaking
the path forks at a beautiful waterfall
mike stops faces the falls turns to see
sheryl behind him catching up
as she does she slips
balances herself yeah
shes about to walk past him but he reaches for sheryls hand and holds it
do you know how many times ive had someone die on me
how many children
i stopped keeping count
i wasnt thinking
what do you want me to do
get rid of the gun
she holds firm
i cant just leave it here in the woods some kid could find it
then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home you get rid of the gun
mike thinks about it
his instincts screaming not to do this then
he removes his backpack zips it open
he pulls out the gun opens it spills the bullets out
mike with a deep breath tosses the bullets into the woods
was that all of them
mike steps back to sheryl they hug
a strange sound like wood snapping startles sheryl
mike turns as well
their eyes widen
the figure emerges from the clearing practically landing on top of them
clyde a park ranger mid s friendly
hes got a weed cutter in his hands wears a pair of work gloves
hes just as surprised to see them
sheryl and mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile
didnt mean to startle you folks
just clearing some of the brush off clyde contd the path
we had some heavy rains this past week knocked some trees and branches down
one of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday but
if you want something done right you gotta do it yourself
we were led to believe this trail wasnt regularly patrolled
its not but
its one of my favorite spots so i often find an excuse to swing by
there are a couple more falls in the park but none quite so
inviting as this one
now dont take my word for it you can see for yourself
how longs your stay
just til sunday
the other falls are clear on the other side
it would take you a couple nights just to get there
maybe next time
this is a quickie trip
just getting out of the city for a couple days
the city huh
if its charleston i wouldnt blame ya
whole place smells like feet
i gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn hmos rules and regulations wont let me visit the local doc
not my cup of tea at all but if you like it there then
no were not from charleston
but apparently we look like we are
we live in alexandria
its just outside of d
ive been there few years back
now that city i like
lotta beautiful churches if i recall correctly
which congregation do yall belong to
sheryl keeps track of all that for us
sheryl gives mike the youre an asshole look
were between congregations at the moment
i should get back to work
sunll be down soon and that path aint gettinclear on its own
clyde walks off until
sheryl doesnt know his name
clyde stops turns back
the names clyde
clyde would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night
be happy too
oh i got it
five corners will be perfect
its just a bit up the ways here near the lake
its five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park
the rocks retain the heat from the day so if you set up camp between them you wont be so cold
just doing my job
you have fun and be careful
clyde tips his cap and disappears
mike and sheryl hike up a steep slope
as they step through the woods they look upon
five large rocks arranged in an awkward semi circle
they walk into the circle take off their backpacks
this is incredible
mike opens the tent pouch starts removing the many parts
ranger said theres a lake near by
id kill to rinse off
sheryl makes a move
wait a sec
itll be dark soon
wheres your sense of adventure
she takes off
lets wait til morning
on sheryl as she stops
looks out towards the water
close on the concealed figures eyes
two different colors with his left being void of almost all color
also notice scarring around the left eye theres no eyebrow and his skin is pale and splotchy
the concealed figure holds all his attention on
sheryl realizes hes right and walks back over to mike
mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent the sheet of instructions laid out
he holds one of the poles which consists of separate links connected by a string
he has no idea where to begin
do you know what you are doing
i think its pretty obvious that i dont
the concealed figure retreats into the forest
stars fill the sky
crickets chirp but aside from that peace and quiet reign
a fire crackles
a tent for two has been pitched
dirty pots pans litter the area
dinners over and done
mike and sheryl cuddle by the fire
a sleeping bag wrapped around them
the worst dinner ever
beat you cooked
yeah im aware
beat you know what would make this evening perfect
i got a whole jar of it
theres a sentence i never thought id say
i have a jar of moonshine
matter of fact ive got enough to share with our entire congregation
our home city of course
but i should start with you
would you like some moonshine
sheryl smiles shakes her head playfully
then what would you like
id like to fuck you
not very christian of you
im more old testament
whats that mean
but i think its the nastier of the two books
sheryl pulls mike into her they kiss
strong and deep
sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss enough foreplay
she stands up pulls mike into the tent with her
sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt then the t shirt
mike kicks off his shoes drops his pants
mike unbuttons sheryls jeans tugs them off
sheryl unhooks her bra tosses it aside
mike slides her panties down her legs and off
few things in life can be described as perfect
sheryls naked body is one of them
sheryl pulls mikes boxers down climbs on top of him
she reaches down and slides mike inside her
sheryl kisses mike
he slides his hands around sheryls butt
sheryl paws his chest bites his lower lip hard
the lovers move in unison
inside the tent mike and sheryl continue
their campfire still burns
a shadow creeps into frame
then a boot
someones outside their tent
breaths get shorter stronger
sheryl and mike build to climax
they dont cant notice
a shadow passes across the wall of the tent
the last final moments before
the lovers exhale
sheryl crashes on top of mike
he wraps his arms tightly around her
the last flames on the fire slowly burn out
mike and sheryl spoon their hands and fingers messed together as one
i was good
i mean even better than usual
if you dont say so
if i dont say so myself yeah
top notch performance
what you disagree
nah it was good
do you think i had anything to do
beat cautious i liked what the old woman said about us earlier
what did she say
that she thought we were married
groans you are relentless
mike gets up starts dressing
i wouldnt be a proper girlfriend if i didnt nag every now and then
i get it but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time
which makes me feel like shit
i didnt mean that
where are you going
do out there what you did in here
put out the fire
sheryl lies back down exhales in frustration
mike now fully dressed pours a bucket of water over the campfire
in the background bags hang from a tree just as ranger sam asked them to do
a smoldering mist of smoke is all thats left of the fire
mike drops the bucket heads for the tent when
he suddenly stops notices
on the ground
a fresh muddy footprint
mike compares his boot to it
its not the same size
mike surveys the area
alls quiet now
but an uneasy feeling has crept back into his bones
mike climbs back inside the tent zips it shut
the sun peeks over the horizon and through the clouds
a bird crows
sheryls eyes snap open
shes nestled comfortably in mikes arms
hes still asleep
sheryl now dressed towel in hand bandana wrapped around her hair vomits behind some trees
after she takes a couple deep breaths swishes some water in her mouth
a beat later she heads off
sheryl stands on the lakes shore checks a couple times over both shoulders
then she takes her sweats and bandana off
lay them on top of her towel
sheryl wearing only her locket carefully steps into the water
but nevertheless her desire to feel clean outweighs the temperature discomfort
on her own little count to three
she dunks her head below the water
as she drops out of sight reveal in the water
sheryl pops up turns towards land and
the concealed figure is gone
sheryl comes back to land
she grabs her towel dries her hair and pats herself dry
she pulls on her sweatpants
starts to tie her bandana around her head and turns straight into
the concealed figure
the sound resonates over
mike opens his eyes
something woke him up not exactly sure what
he sits up and yawns stretches his stiff body
hes alone in the tent
mike now dressed stands behind a tree takes a piss
he shudders slightly
mike finishes his business grabs his water bottle and takes a long drink
he peels off the bandage from his hand
it looks fine today
he looks around but no sign of sheryl
mike walks up to the water looks in both directions
a pang of concern registers
he kneels down cups some water and splashes it over his face hair
as he opens his eyes he notices something
in the wash of the waves sparkling in the sunlight
its sheryls locket
the chain broken
he picks it up
calls out sheryl
mike looks around
hes completely alone
the blood drains from his face
mike pockets the necklace
he starts into the water
did she drown
just as he gets knee deep
mike stops turns back looking at the forest
he hustles out of the water heading for the woods
mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the steep little slope
he flies up the slope but loses traction and slips banging his knee
top of his lungs sheryl
mike pushes himself up continues on
mikes really moving now
he scoots through the first patch of trees and hustles down a slope
mike emerges from the woods drops into a clearing
looking around wildly
pov of mike has he been here before
it all looks the same
not even sure which direction he just came from
what to do now
tight on mike as he races through the trees
his legs trample over rocks dirt shrubs
mike trips falls down hard
he lifts his forearm to reveal blood scrapes and a long sharp splinter sticking out
the sight of it almost makes mike puke right then and there
mike grabs hold of the splinter turns his head
takes about a thousand short quick breaths and
pulls the he removes the gray bandana from his back pocket wraps it around his wound
mike lays back stares up into the sky
tries to catch his breath calm down
faint sound of laughter
mike sits up
again faint sound of laughter
mike stands takes a couple of steps toward the sound
mikes got the scent takes off in its direction
mike follows the voices through a thick patch of trees
he stops at the top and looks down
pov of mike walking along the main path obscured by the trees is darryl and lonnie
they drink laugh about something
lonnie carries some fishing poles
mikes about fifteen feet above them
he narrows his focus in on
mikes pov darryl twirling something in his hand
its sheryls blue hikers towel
mike turns red with fury
he looks back down
mikes pov darryl a shotgun slung around his shoulder
mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near a tree parallel to him
darryl and lonnie continue along until
darryl stops turns
lonnie looks at daryl
what is it
darryl holds his look into the woods then
suddenly mike leaps from behind a tree whacks the surprised darryl across the face with the stick
darryl drops like a sack of potatoes
mike locks eyes with a terrified lonnie
where is she
lonnie pauses frozen
he then takes off disappearing through the trees
darryl lies on the ground moaning
he pushes himself up to his knees
blood pours from a fresh gash across his head
mike grabs darryls shotgun aims at darryl
take it easy
where is she
what the fuck you talking about
what did you do to her
i didnt fuckin do nothing
i dont know
mike cracks darryl across the jaw with the barrel
you have sheryls towel
what the fuck did you do to her
darryls a mess his nose busted
he gags on blood and teeth
mike stares at the bloody desight that is darryl
even mike has to turn away for a moment for this
i foun the towel

thats youre fucking story you inbred fuck
points gun at darryls head stop fucking lying or i will kill you
don kill me
i foun it
up the paf back dere
just a bit ago
mikes finger itches the trigger
hes turning red
breathing hard heavy
lowers the weapon turns his back to darryl stares into the woods
the tension fades for the moment
but only a moment
didnt think you had dat in you city boy
looks at his shirt the blood shit
i just got dis shirt
darryl while mike is distracted seizes his opportunity reaches behind
angle on darryl slides a pocket knife from his back pocket
damn shame you lost dat fine piece oass
something dat sweet dont comeround every day
even for pretty folk like you
shut the fuck up
angle on still concealed from mike darryl opens the pocket knife the blade fully extended
you best hope you find herfore i do
cause i will enjoy tearing her ass apart
mike turns faces darryl and when im done there i will cut her eyeballs out and skull fuck her
mike simmers to a boil any luck brodys already beat me to it
mike takes a step towards darryl when
darryl lunges out darryl misses with his initial swipe but its enough to knock mike down the shotgun falls to the side
darryl pins mike to the ground tries to dagger the knife into him but mike grabs his wrist
darryl pushes down the knife inches closer to mikes chest until
mike head butts darryl sending the skinny hick off him
darryl rolls away in pain
mike scrambles crawls for
he grabs it
darryl regroups turns around but is met with
mike bashes darryls face with the butt
this knocks darryl completely out
mike stands over darryl
the morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce the cloudy skies
mike arrives back at their campsite shotgun in tow
he freezes completely floored
everything is gone
the tent the backpacks the mess kits everything
even the fire pit
mike looks around turning looking
he snaps open the shotgun hes got two shells
he closes it heads back into the woods
mike moves deeper into the woods
hes a mix of paranoia and determination
mike pauses catching his breath when
a few blood drops of blood land on his face
mike wipes his face looks at the blood
what the fuck
a couple more drops hit him
mike looks up
a mangled mutilated deer hangs in the trees secured by coarse thick ropes
mike takes a terrified step backwards unaware
a few feet mike still mesmerized by the blood and the deer continues backing up
getting closer to the bear trap
his foot hovers over the center of the trap
mike screams in agony
he drops to the ground stares at his leg now a bloody mess of flesh and steel
mike writhes in pain on the ground
his eyes watering
the pain unbearable
mikes pov someone or thing appears stepping from the forest
they come closer
the sun blasts directly behind the figure keeping their identity hidden
mikes eyelids flutter cant determine who what it is
the pain overwhelms him
he doesnt care any longer
ida bends down next to mike
michael can you hear me
her words fade out
he promptly passes out
close on mikes eyes snap open dart side to side blink
reveal mike lays on a ragged couch
the place is dark and dusty
a glance around
gaslights hang in the corners
a stack of logs rest next to an old fireplace
just off the main room is a kitchen alcove with a coal stove
on the stove a whistling teapot
mikes memory slowly comes back
he leans up when
a sharp pain shoots through his body
mike reaches for his leg
the tourniquet conceals the damage
a damn towel is wrapped around where the wound is
a bandage has replaced the gray bandana on his arm
ida enters the cabin from the back door into the kitchen
she removes the teapot from the burner
the whistling stops
look whos up
where am i
youre in my home michael
you gave me quite a scare
i thought i lost you
ida grabs a wet wash cloth wrings it out over a basin and walks back to mike
lucky the snap didnt break the bone just bruised it
i know thats of little comfort now but trust me its a good thing
that dirty trap howevers prime for spreading infection need to finish cleaning out that wound and then ill get some evening primrose in you
same stuff the indian tribes used it back in the day to heal well
just about everything
sos do i
ida unwraps the tourniquet examines the wound
try and relax
ida cleans the wound
he cant watch
for saving my life
you dont have to thank me
up here we take care of one another
thats the only way any of us survive
im sorry but i dont know your name
oh for the sake of sunshine
how rude a host am i

ida moves to the kitchen grabs a mason jar with clear liquid
it looks just like the jar mike bought from brody
ida i need some help

cause thats what youre risking
soon as were done ill call
ida hands a second rag to mike
bite down on this
i aint gonna lie
lotta pain about to hit you sweetheart
mike puts the rag in his mouth
ida dips the used cloth in the moonshine
he closes his eyes tight and
ida applies the moonshine to the wound
mike screams through the cloth
its almost over
mike screams again
his eyes water
ida offers her palm
mike opens his mouth
the cloth falls into her hand
mike breathes heavily coming down from the pain
ida crosses to the kitchen disposes of the two wash cloths and grabs a larger towel
she walks back to mike and wraps his calf with the towel
well get some of that primrose in you and youll be good as new
can you call down please
ill take care of it right now
ida heads to a closed door on the far side of the room
she opens and enters sure to close the door behind her
mike relaxes as best he can anyway
ida you in there
mikes pov through a small slit in the drapes brody waits outside
ida exits the room heads for the door
whispers hes looking for me
whispers concerned whys that
whispers i think he had something to do with sheryl going missing
whispers ill take care of it
ida lemme in
ida helps mike stand re directs him to the kitchen alcove
he winces all the way
she leans him up against the near wall so that he is out of view of the door
ida goes to the front door opens it halfway revealing an agitated brody shotgun in hand
suspicious brody tries to peek past ida into the cabin
she doesnt budge
what took you so long
what do you want brody
im looking for a man hiker
this man hiker alone or wit someone
he had a lady friend but
im just looking for him now
on mike listening nervously
well i aint seen no one in days
brody glares at her
she glares right back
brody again tries to see past her into the cabin but she blocks him
whatd he do you for anyway
he busted darryls face in with a shotgun
left him a mess of blood and teeth
nearly killed him
beat you spot anyone you dont know you be sure to find me
brody eyeballs ida one last time then leaves
ida watches him go closes the door and heads to the alcove
brody and those boys are a pain in the backside
im sure that cousin of his had it coming
ida leads mike back to the couch
what did the ranger say
does he need to speak to me
when is he coming
ida heads back to the kitchen grabs a mug and pours hot water into it
she dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder into the hot water
sorry i wasnt able to reach anyone
ida stirs the powder in as she walks back to mike
then please dont take the lords name in vain in this house
she glares long cold and hard at mike until
ida hands him the steaming mug
mikes mind races
somethings not right
im sure theyre just on rounds and will be back any minute
well try them again and well find sheryl
she probably just took a wrong turn up here ended up in the middle of dont know where
happens lots of times
looks to the mug please drink up michael it will make you feel better
mike holds the mug stares at the drink
he puts it to his lips but then stops looks at ida
she stares at him
unnerved by the stare mike lowers the mug without sipping
how did you know my name
confused excuse me
you keep calling me michael
you did it just now
you did before just after i woke up
you called me michael
nobody calls me michael
im sure youre mistaken
you musta told me before
no i would have told you mike
only my grandmother whos dead ever called me michael
well how else could i have known your name
on my drivers license and credit cards it says michael
if you stole my wallet from the campsite
thats how youd have known
youre accusing me of stealing your wallet
i saved your life
why would i steal your wallet
mike doesnt respond now just drink your primrose
fuck the primrose
mike tosses the mug across the room
mike lifts himself up
despite the pain he heads for the room ida went in to make the radio call
where do you think youre going
i want to call the ranger myself
ida springs to her feet jumps in front of mike
im getting in that room ida
mike maneuvers around her when
ida grabs the iron fire poker by the stove holds it like a baseball bat
i cant let you in there
mike takes a step forward
ida swings the poker
nearly hits mike
mike jukes left she swings again
where is sheryl ida
shes in that room isnt she
you sinners are all alike
i heard you last night
spitting in the face
ida contd of the lord and his laws
dining on the sins of the flesh
inside the tent mike and sheryl make love
their campfire still burns
a shadow creeps into frame
then a boot
suddenly ida appears in a new light
you and your bitch whore girlfriend will atone for your sins
mike lunges forward grabs hold of the poker before ida can swing it again
they struggle crash up against the wall
the poker falls to the floor
ida jumps on mikes back wraps her arms around his throat
mike spins ida around in circles then slams ida up against the wall
the two fall to the floor
mike pushes himself up but before he can get away
mike screams in agony
instinctively mike kicks ida in the face boot to nose
idas head snaps back then falls face first on the floorboard
mike is panting glances at ida
shes out cold
mike pushes himself up limps to the door
he grabs the handle pushes it open
mike enters to find a sewing machine some yarn an antique radio but more importantly no sheryl
he steps over to the radio when he notices
an inch thick layer of dust covers the radio
he swipes it with his finger
this thing hasnt been used in years
mike turns steps on a throw rug laying in the center of the floor
his foot sinks a little
mike tests the floor board again
he pulls the rug out
reveal a trap door
mike grabs the latch lifts it open
looking up past a weathered worn and wooden staircase up at mike
carefully mike makes his way down the steps into
religious artifacts lots of them
crosses photos of jesus statues of mary etc
don the walls shelves
on the far side of the room
like an altar shrine
nine inside each jar human fetuses all in various stages of development and deformity
each jar is labelled with their own individual bronze nameplate matthew
the last jar the fetus is closest to term maybe months along
the nameplate reads timothy
mike completely freaked out backpedals bumps into an iron door
he turns the handle opens it
its pitch black as mike opens the door
next to the door a light switch
he flips it on
sounding like small gunshots a series of overhead lights turn on illuminating a long narrow curved hallway
at the far end
recognize this from the opening scene
its distant muffled
mike stirs hearing the faint muted sound from the end of the hallway
mike staggers leans against the wall for support
hes woozy but determined
he proceeds down the hall towards the doors
just as mike passes underneath a light
the lights explodes
sparks glass shower onto mike
as he brushes himself off
a scream cries out
mike moves faster reaches the end of the hallway faces the door
he turns the knob pushes it open and
mike steps into the room the light from the hall spills into the room falls across
sheryl tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth
shes bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches
sheryl and mikes eyes lock
euphoria pain all at once
oh my god
mike runs to her touches her face
he checks the ropes tying sheryl
theyre very secure
i need something to cut you down baby
sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room
mike follows her gaze
scanning the room
a tool bench
on a tool bench a litany of the conventional and unconventional
a hammer screw drivers axes a flashlight then finally
in the middle of bunch
a hunters knife
mike grabs the knife hobbles back to sheryl
he slides the blade between her cheek and the rope slices
several tense moments later
the rope breaks
mike tosses the rope and gag away
are you okay
get me out of here
mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists
hell be back soon
off screen a loud thud resounds
where did it come from
not wanting or waiting to find out mike doubles the effort
come on come on come on
finally the ropes tear
darkness surround the young couple
sheryl lets rip a short but loud scream
mike quickly silences her
mike and sheryl take refuge in each others arms
on the tool bench
he feels around for the bench when
he banged his injured leg on something
whispers what are you doing
mike reaches the tool bench feels around
mike turns on the flashlight
the beam cuts through the darkness and onto
the concealed figure stands face to face with mike brandishing his axe sickle
the concealed figure swings the axe sickle slices mike across the forearm
blood sprays across the floor
mike yelps in pain drops the flashlight and knife
but sheryl freezes
he comes at mike again but
he eludes the attack
mike grabs the flashlight the only weapon within his reach and swings striking the concealed figure in the knee he drops to the ground
the concealed figure grabs mike by the throat runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall
sheryls frozen in fear
he squeezes his throat harder tighter
mike cant breathe
mike smacks the concealed figure in the face squirms all to no avail until
mike jams his thumb into his eye
he screams drops mike
they both fall to the floor
the fallen flashlights beam illuminates sheryl backed in the corner
to sheryl get the fuck out of here
finally sheryl runs out of the room
sheryl feels her way out by touching the wall
as the concealed figure writhes in pain
mike catches his breath attempts to stand only
his body buckles under the pain
he throws a look to the figure then crawls over to the tool bench
he pulls himself up using the bench for support
he haphazardly feels for a weapon
he grabs a hammer turns and
the figure grabs mikes wrist then head butts mike between the eyes
he falls to the floor
the concealed figure holds his injured eye with one hand grabs the sickle axe with the other
sheryl reaches the iron door but stops
looks back into the darkness
no response mike
still no answer
sheryl spots the light switch suddenly the concealed figure appears out of the darkness
he lunges for sheryl but misses
she runs through the door into
sheryl rushes into the room but trips on something
when she gets up the first thing she sees
the fetus jars
she coughs violently almost pukes
she stumbles hurries up the trap door steps
a moment later
the concealed figure pops through the iron door
for the first time we see the concealed figure wholly
this is deacon
half his body scarred burned
he stands well over six feet tall muscles rippling everywhere
a frightful sight
he peers up the trap door steps pursues sheryl
sheryl bursts through the front door running for the woods
deacon exits the cabin spots sheryl
runs after her
sheryl runs as fast as she can
breaking branches in her way leaping rocks
anything to get away from
this is his terrain turf
he moves quickly and efficiently through the brush
sheryl looks back and as she does
trips over some tree roots
she falls face first into a giant puddle
she pushes herself out of the puddle
shes soaked but doesnt stop
she resumes running
closing the gap
sheryl confused scared and lost looks around wildly
has no idea where shes going
then suddenly she hears something
she looks down a slight hill
sheryls pov a ranger truck drives along a gravel road
thank you god
at the top of her lungs sheryl darts down the hill and falls out onto
the ranger truck slams on the brakes inches from running over sheryl
she slams her arms down on the hood
clyde startled beyond belief looks out at sheryl
he gets out of the car goes to her
she hugs clyde tightly starts crying
he looks at her
the blood cuts etc
oh my stars what happened to you
out of breath you have to help me
i was kidnapped
my boyfriend came
and this mans chasing me
hes chasing me right now
i cant make heads or tails of what youre saying
hes right behind me
clyde looks up into the woods from where sheryl came but
alls peaceful at the moment
look miss theres no one there
oh my god mike
angle from down the path clyde his back to us consoles sheryl
deacon steps into frame
sickle axe in hand
he starts toward clyde and sheryl
its going to be fine miss
i promise you
everythings going to be fine
sheryl pries her face from clydes chest
sheryls pov deacons five feet behind clyde and closing
off her look clyde turns
deacon and clyde stand face to face
the moments frozen
for too long
somethings not right
deacon whats going on
how the heck did she escape
sheryl looks at clyde in shock
deacon lowers his head ashamed
want something done gotta do it yourself
clyde removes a black wooden club from his belt
sheryl turns about to run when
clyde cracks her across the sheryls pov out of focus wobbly
lights a rainbow of fuzzy colors dance before us
slowly bring into focus
sheryl coughs gags on something
sheryls pov she lifts her arms to discover her wrists are tied together tightly
sheryls pov ida enters the room carrying something
sheryls breath quickens
ida walks right up to sheryl
she places a flower wreath in her hair adjusts it to fit
you are lovely as a summers day
checks her watch its almost time
sheryl catches her reflection in a small wall mirror
angle on a rope looped through a hook in the ceiling
end on mike
mikes passed out
he dangles in the middle of the room
he wears an old moth eaten sports jacket and slacks
a rope gags his mouth
angle on the sickle axe
as it moves towards mike
deacon a black ring surrounds his injured eye steps in front of mike holds the blade centimeters from mikes eye
an eye for an eye
mike wakes and
immediately freaks out
he tries to shake loose but cant
deacon stares at him but
he wears a long garment around his neck carries a bible
get him ready
deacon backs off
he undoes a slipknot on the far wall which causes mike to come crashing to the floor
deacon lifts mike to his feet positions him
its only now mike gets a gander at the room
the fetus jars adorn the far wall
theres a giant wooden cross hanging over a makeshift altar
candles anywhere and everywhere
an old phonograph one that you crank to play rests in the corner
clyde places the needle down on a record cranks the wheel
the music kicks in classical religious
its hollow full of static and futz
his eyes open wide as
the iron door slowly creaks open
angle on a filthy pair of white dress shoes
ropes secure the ankles so movements limited to inches at a time
shimmying into the room wearing a dusty old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is sheryl
her wrists still bound
her mouth gagged
mike and sheryl take each other in
tears spring to sheryls eyes
she takes another jerky step closer
ida is visible behind her guides her towards mike
she positions her next to him so that both face the altar
clyde glances to ida who silences the music
and jesus answered and said unto them each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband
the husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife and likewise the wife to her husband
and so in the presence of our lord jesus christ i ask you michael
and you sheryl do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage
mike and sheryl stare at clyde
clyde glances to deacon who immediately steps forward touches the sickle blade to sheryls throat
ill ask again
do you accept this covenant of marriage
sheryl nods immediately
mike nods too
clyde signals for deacon to step back
then by the power vested in me i pronounce you man and wife
clyde signals to ida
ida removes sheryls graduation ring from her finger
she then slides two tarnished gold bands one on sheryls finger the other on mikes
clyde unties the rope securing mikes gag in his mouth removes it
why are you doing this
we did nothing to you people
let us go
you may kiss the bride
you fucking people are fucking sick
clydes temper flares
stern and cold do not use that type of language in this house again
kiss the bride or
gestures to deacon hell cut off your lips
mike stares in horror at clyde turns to sheryl
i love you
mike kisses her briefly on the cheek
clyde smiles satisfied nods to deacon
he immediately lifts sheryl up and throws her over his shoulder
what are you doing
deacon carries her from the room
to clyde let her go
please let her go
clyde pulls the ropes hoists mike back into a dangling position
he secures the knot before exiting the room
mike contd please
dont hurt her
whatever it is you want ill give it to you
i know you will
she stuffs the gag in secures it in place with the rope
she ties the knot
ida exits the room
mike is alone
mike tries to yank his hands through the knot
his wrists and hands turn red his face is flushed
the knot is too tight
mike takes a breath and tries again
his face and hands are beet red
he pulls and pulls
but the rope doesnt budge
its no use
he dangles there helpless
resting under the full moon sits the cabin
mike still dangles by his wrists
clyde unties the end of the rope on the floor
the rope unfurls mike drops to the ground
clyde picks him up sits him in a nearby chair
mikes wrists ankles and mouth still bound and gagged
gonna untie your mouth now
have a little man to man talk
clyde undoes the gag in mikes mouth
its not too late
let us go
we wont tell anyone
beat how well do you know your bible michael
jesus fucking christ
clyde slaps mike across the face
i told you before to watch that mouth mister
clyde punches him not once but twice
he readies a third
mike spits some blood on the floor
ill ask again
how well do you know the bible
thats why i am here
teach you the way things are and the way they should be
sheryl sits in a chair in the middle of the room
she wears a new outfit
a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart
its similar to the ida pulls tight the rope securing her wrists to the arms of the chair
ill be right back
ida exits the room
deacon stands by the door
he and sheryl alone together
sheryl tries not to make eye contact
deacon stares at her
deacons pov on sheryls chest expanding and contracting with every breath
deacons pov sheryl a heavenly glow encircles her and her gag mysteriously gone turns to deacon
a look of calm and lust in her eyes
i want you deacon
jump cut to
i want you to fuck me
on deacon his stare deepens
sheryl the heavenly glow gone her gag back in place
she squirms cries
clyde sits in a chair next to mike
lord knows the will of a man gets tested
cruelly most times
but the righteous persevere
they do what needs to be done even though they dont want to
its what makes a man a man
let me tell you the story of judas he was one of jesuss apostles
judas led roman soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our lord jesus christ
and now is supposedly seated next to satan his soul burning in hell forever for this sin
but i dont believe thats the case
i have my own theory
the death of jesus was predicted thousands of years before judas ever came along
and for the prophecy to be fulfilled jesus had to die
if he didnt the gates of heaven couldnt be opened for mankind
i dont think for an instant judas wanted to be the one but
someone had to
judas helped jesus so jesus could die for our sins
save us all
and i believe at this moment
judas is in heaven despite his sin because it led to the greater good
beat relations prior to marriage is a sin
you and sheryl are sinners in the lords eyes
and because of those sins your souls are damned
but ida and me were gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing but
as previously stated you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of your character
but youll do it
because thats what needs to be done
mike stares unflinching at clyde
deacon kneels before sheryl who tries to move but cant
angle on deacon lays his scarred hand on sheryls thigh
sheryl squirms but thats all she can do
deacon jumps up backs off
you get away from her
ida sets a tray she was carrying down chases deacon from the room
she shuts the door behind him
im sorry about that sugar
my brother hes not well
she retrieves the tray brings it over closer to sheryl
its not all his fault
our father wasnt very christian and then there was the accident
along with the scarring lost use of his vocals
cant speak a lick
now ive spoken to him
what happened with the others wont happen to you
hes promised me that
what did he do
im gonna take that out of your mouth now
i brought you some tea got some primrose in it
help you relax get some rest
ida unties the gag in sheryls mouth
she coughs a few times
ida raises the mug of tea to her lips
please dont do this
please let me go
i just want to go home
cold drink the tea
ida brings the mug to her lips again pours some in sheryls mouth
she swallows a big gulp
changing topics i almost forgot to ask
how does it feel being married
why are you doing this
i thought youd be happy about that
all i ever wanted out of life was two things
to be married and to have a baby
the lord blessed me with clyde and i thank him every day for that
ida pours some more tea into sheryl
but having a babys been
clyde walks over to the fetus jars
stares at them
a sadness in his eyes
she can conceive fine
cant seem to make it all the way through
timothy was the toughest
made it to month eight
angle on the timothy fetus jar
the most developed of them all
city doctor had some fancy mumbo jumbo words for the condition
beat turns to mike breaks my heart every time
that woman was born to be a mother
its her calling in life
just like you and sheryl have a calling
what exactly do you want from us
the iron door flies open deacon emerges stands over mike
sheryl sways back and forth
her eyelids heavy
the primrose kicking in
ida places her hand on sheryls cheek
youre young strong
its gonna be easy for you
not like me
barely conscious wh what
youre gonna have a baby sheryl
beat my baby
deacon drags mike down the hall
the door to the room flies open
deacon drags mike inside clyde right behind them
to mikes horror
oh my god
sheryl lies unconscious on top of the table ida by her side
angle on sheryl each of her limbs tied down with heavy rope
her legs are spread apart
what have you done to her
shell be out for hours but shes fine
idall come back in a little bit check to see that the deed has been done
if it hasnt
the next time you see your little lady
a piece of her will be missing
clyde contd cold dont test us on that one
now we know conceptions not automatic
so dont feel like all the pressures on right now
were prepared to do this however long it takes
you give us the effort each time eventually the magic will happen
youre out of your fucking minds
clyde grabs mikes wrist turns over his palm
clyde takes a knife from his belt slices mikes palm
what did i tell you about the language
ida grabs a fresh rag wraps mikes hand in it
deacon will be right outside that door
the only door
this room has no windows and is buried twenty feet below ground
cutting to the chase
theres no way out and you can scream yourself hoarse no one will hear you
well let you have your privacy now
remembers oh almost forgot
ida goes to the corner where the phonograph sits
she cranks the handle places the needle on the record
the record crackles pachelbels canon fills the room
deacon clyde and ida exit
they shut and lock the door behind them
deacon stands by the door
ida and clyde holding hands walk towards the stairs
its gotta work this time
beat he doesnt
promise me clyde
clyde wraps his arm around idas shoulder comforting her
mike makes his way to the table to sheryl
he pulls himself to his feet
he takes sheryl in
she looks peaceful
he runs his good hand through her hair
tears roll down his cheeks
mike checks each of sheryls ropes
they are all tightly secured
mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room
but clyde was right
no way out
mike stares at the phonograph
he kicks it off the table vfx mikes breathing intensifies
push into tight close up
his world is not caving in its already caved
the night sky rapidly changes from black to blue
the sun rises
sheryls head falls to the side bumps the table
she finds mike is passed out sitting in a chair his hand holding hers
the door unbolts flies open
mike comes to and glances up as deacon storms into the room drags him out screaming
ida stands just outside the doorway lets them pass
she slides some surgical gloves on shuts the door behind her
angle on sheryl as the door shuts
mike without his shirt hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling
hes hooked up the same way the young man was in the opening scene of the story
deacon secures the last of the restraints
clyde enters walks straight up to mike
was i at all unclear yesterday
did you understand what was expected of you
how do you expect
clearly you did not understand
you did not even attempt relations last evening
what youre asking to do is sick
you didnt have a problem when penetration was a sin but when its your wife its sick
clyde glares angrily at mike then heads to the door
you knew the rules michael
i warned you
now deacon here will remind you
mike turns to deacon who stands over the tool bench
dozens of sharp instruments of torture lay before him
clyde shuts the door on mike
clyde shuts the door
ida waits helps him with his coat
im going to be late for work
be home at the regular time
clyde removes a set of keys from his pocket
notice the boston red sox key chain
theyre mikes keys
might be a bit late
i have an errand that needs attending to
clyde kisses ida exits
deacon stands by the tool bench his back to mike
deacon grabs several different scary instruments of torture tests them out
mike tries to see what hes doing
horrible sounds metal deacon finally selects a weapon turns around
mike stares at deacon who holds a cat o nine tails in his hand
deacon walks behind mike
you dont have to do this
deacon pulls his arm back whips mike across the back
sheryl hears mikes screams but shes in a predicament of her own
sheryls tied to chair
her hand is secured to table top
she cant move it
what are they doing to him
you should concern yourself with whats about to happen to you
ida opens a sewing box but instead of needles and yarn she removes a cleaver
sheryl looks at the cleaver then
to her hand
the pinky finger separated and immobile
what are you doing ida
you think youre so much smarter than me dont you
yes you do
admit itcause i can see it in your eyes darling
with your fancy schools and job and such
realizes you think you are better than me
no i dont
yes she does
beat might surprise you but i was quite the student back in the day
every subjectcept for science
infuriated me how they tried to explain away the lords creations
our teacher mr
billings once said
in the future humans wont be born with a pinky fingercause of evolution
frustration building of all the
i shouted no
we are created in the lords image
not some nonsensical theory by darwind
sheryl stares at ida terrified would be an understatement
i suppose mr
billings and mr
darwind can stand up and cheer because you little lady
youre about to evolve
his back cut bruised and bloody
deacon faces mike looks him square in the eyes
he walks back to the tool bench lays the whipping device down
mike breathes a touch easier until
deacon reappears a jar of moonshine in his hands
he dips one of his scarred fingers into the liquid and gently touches a wound on mikes body
the liquid stings
what are you going to do with that
ida sits next to sheryl
she raises the cleaver
please ida dont
dont do this
you think i want to hurt a pretty thing like you
pains me but
until you and your husband obey my hands much like yours are tied
i know about your condition ida
its not your fault
there are a lot of women that cant carry a baby full term
i know how much youre hurting
ida takes her attention from the finger starts to pay attention to sheryl
you dont know anything about me or what ive gone through
im here for you now
ill help you
ida stares at sheryl
deacon splashes the entire jar of moonshine on mikes back
ida and sheryl turn in the direction of the scream
this seems to bring ida back from wherever she was back to the matter at hand
ida looks into sheryls tear filled eyes
you can help
by following the rules
ida chops off sheryls pinky finger
the sun burns overhead
clyde stands on the banks of a algae covered swamp
he stares out nervously watching
brody in his beat up pick up truck pulls to a stop
exits the truck approaches clyde
i stopped by your place the other day
so have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker
beat in fact i have
i saw him and his lady leave
when was this
just before dusk
believe what you want
clyde looks out at the swamp then back to brody who never stopped staring at clyde
i saw their car last night in the parking lot at base
so they didnt leave just before dusk
well i was down at base this morning
cars gone now
something dont feel right here clyde
between you and ida
i dont have time for this
he starts to walk away but brody grabs his wrist tightly
take your hand off me brody
what do you know about that hiker you aint telling me
brody waits a beat then lets him go
i told you brody
i saw them leave
let it go
brody watches clyde head off
hes even more paranoid now than before
what brody doesnt notice
angle on the swamp
just below the water sinking the outline of the back of the passat
darkness envelops the cabin
a coyote howls
sheryl on table unconscious
her hand finger bandaged
the doors thrown open
deacon throws mike roughly to floor
hes tied per usual
notice the back of mikes shirt soaked in blood
how do you expect me to do this
do we need to provide you with some more motivation
you wouldnt want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again now would you
youll never get away with this
we have friends and family
they know where we went
theyll come looking for us
theyll find us
that may very well be
but they wont find your car
clyde dangles the keys his keys in front of mike
deacon clyde and ida leave
mike limps over to sheryl he sees her bandaged hand
oh baby what did they do to you
im so sorry
without moving barely audible are they gone
their entire conversation is no louder than a whisper
sheryl turns to face mike
i didnt swallow that shit she gave me
sheryl spies the back of his jersey in a mirrors reflection
oh my god
youre not okay
were not okay
what are we gonna do
i dont know
sheryl takes a moment
thinks carefully about how exactly to phrase this
we should just give them what they want
if it stops them from hurting you and me
maybe we should
no fucking way
forget the fact that the moment you get pregnant theyll kill me
then the moment you give birth youre dead
beyond both of those reasons
aint no fucking way i am going to give them our child
tears pour from sheryl
for all my coward marriage moments
ive thought about our child
is that stupid
i picture what hell be like
i picture your heart
and i picture us raising him
growing old with him
aint no fucking way im going to give him to them
they keep talking about sins
that would be the worst sin of them all
beat ill get us out of this sheryl
i promise you
birds chirp overhead
sunlight streaks through the clouds
angle on a fine cloth rubs delicately but firmly one of the fetus jars timothy
ida finishes steps off the small stool
the jars sparkle and shine brightly
she gazes at the fetus jars with love affection
the pain of lives unfulfilled weighing heavy on her strong shoulders
the trap door opens clyde comes down the steps
ida turns to clyde
the morning fog engulfs the mountains
sam the ranger that greeted mike and sheryl enters sipping a cup of coffee
evelyn s a perky and adorable ranger works at the desk
good morning sam
aint no better than any of the other days evelyn so bring the glee down some would ya
sam grabs some papers from his mailbox
evelyns used to sams moods
hey sam do you remember a virginia couple pass through here sometime friday
there was one couple but they didnt say where they were from
gals mothers called three times this morning
said she hasnt heard from her daughter since before she left and she didnt show up for work yesterday or today
she sure this was the park they were coming to
womans already offering up a reward
have her fax some photos up here
been a while since we had a couple go missing
twelve months ago the last
sam crosses to the bulletin board by the door
he studies the flier of the missing couple that sheryl had noticed
clyde and ida are with him
you dont have to check
clyde and ida are pissed
we do appreciate your honesty michael
and believe me we understand your extreme situation but
punishments going to have to be handed down
suddenly clydes walkie talkie goes off
clyde its sam at base come back

mike screams trying to be heard while clyde has button pushed
to deacon and ida restrain him
deacon holds mike while ida grabs the gag
yeah morning clyde

i told you
i told theyd be coming
ida shoves the gag into his mouth ties it secure
when you get a chance grab some and lets start circulating huh
clyde throws a concerned look to ida
clyde thinks a beat then
to deacon get him in the other room
concern covers clydes face
brody washes out some mason jars
his shotgun rests against a nearby tree
lonnie smokes pot from his handmade pipe
a walkie talkie crackles
get rid of the dope
brody hides the jars in his satchel
lonnie quickly tucks his pipe away fans the smoke away
she eyes her watch pardon me
evelyn damn hurts looking at you
when you gonna give it up to me
now with a line like that its a shocker i havent already
you stone cold tease
was wondering if either of you had seen any hikers pass by in the last day or so
lonnies about to respond but brody cuts him off
whats this about
evelyn hands them a flier
on the flier photos of mike and sheryl name info etc
brodys eyes light up
these two are missing
it would seem so
why have you seen them
brody hesitates and then shakes his head no
you talk to clyde about this
all the rangers are on the lookout
familys even offering up a reward

im guessing its a fair amount
well me and lonnie will keep a lookout for you too
anything we can do to help
evelyn begins walking off
you change you mind ill ride you raw
evelyn ignores lonnie moves on her way
itd be the best fifteen seconds of your life darling
brody watches her go
as she disappears he grabs his gun
clyde comes up to ida
she stands over a bar b q pit just your run of the ordinary backyard variety ones
noose is starting to tighten ida
you promised this time would be the time
i want that baby
ida flips open a silver lighter sparks up a flame
she touches the flame to a piece of kindling drops it into the bar b q
were gonna have to double our efforts here
leave that to me
ida lifts three iron brands from a long leather bag
she places the heads of the brands into the bar b q
sheryl sits alone tied gagged and confined to a chair on the far end of the room
close on behind sheryls back
her bloody hands sans one finger tremble softly
her remaining digits start to loosen her restraints
mike hangs once again
clyde stands before him ida enters
she wheels the bar b q in the room
in the pit its filled with hot smoking coals
also three iron brands rest buried in the coals
all glow a fiery i think we have to have another
man to man discussion here michael
but unlike previous moments mike is not begging or pleading
he holds a calm demeanor
seems as though time is now factoring into our situation
sheryl continues working the ropes as
the door creaks open
sheryl freezes stops working the ropes
deacon enters sickle in hand
hes calm and determined
he stares at sheryl
sinister thoughts in mind
quick cuts deacons pov sheryls mouth chest legs
deacon approaches sheryl kneels down in front of her
he lays the sickle on the floor
sheryl eyes the weapon
deacon takes something from his pocket lifts his arms up towards sheryls head
she winces expecting the worst
deacon slides sheryls locket around her neck
the chain repaired
deacon beams with pride
deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his hands on sheryls bare thighs
she twitches instinctively causing deacon to squeeze her thighs tighter
sheryl winces in pain stops her struggle
locks eyes with deacon
suddenly an aura of calm falls over her
behind sheryls back
she resumes untying the knots
deacon savors every moment of sheryl
her smell form
he glides his hands up her body past her stomach and onto her breasts
he gropes them in his own heaven
close on the knot loosens
ida rotates the brands in the bar b q doing her best subtle intimidation
were not violent people michael
it pains us to pain you
i dont know
seems as though deacon and yourselves get a real kick out of it
now see this is what i am talking about
its your attitude
its the disobedience the cussing
sooner we get what we want then no further harm has to fall upon you and your wife
way i see it you need us alive
you need us period
and now that park services and state police are looking for us youre starting to panic
mike contd knowing your whole plans crumbling down before your eyes
to ida strong so you can stop spinning those fucking irons thinking youre scaring me cause youre not
beat to both of them youre a couple of demented sick pathetic freaks
ida grabs a brand jabs it onto mikes chest
deacon tears open sheryls blouse exposing her bra and more cleavage
he slides his hands over her breasts
hes in heaven
sheryl doesnt resist because
close on the knots undone
her hands are free
deacon looks into sheryls eyes
he senses something different
does he know
deacon pulls himself closer to sheryl
their faces only inches apart
he pulls her gag out of her mouth lets it dangle around her neck
sheryl swallows nervously
resists the urge to scream
deacon leans in
knowing its now or never sheryl knees deacon in the balls
he falls over in agony
deacon looks up at her when
she kicks him right in the face
sheryl springs from the chair grabs the sickle turns and
deacon already back on his feet punches sheryl hard across the jaw
she hits the wall then falls to the floor drops the sickle
angle on a small pocket knife falls off a shelf in the room onto the floor
deacon grabs the sickle then lifts her up by her hair and drags her across the room
he throws her face stomach down on the table top flips her dress up onto her back
he slides the sickle between her ass and underwear and
cuts her panties off in one quick sheryl still stunned from the punch only now starts to realize what is happening to her
weak soft no
she tries to wiggle off table or close her legs but deacons too strong
he grabs the back of her head slams it against the table pinning it in place
with the other hand he stronger no
mike his chest scarred bloody from the fresh wound dangles helplessly
vomit splashed down his body
clyde and ida look to one another
what was that
deacon slaps his left hand over her mouth climbs on top of sheryl using his weight to keep her in place
deacon positions himself for penetration when
sheryl screams but deacons hand muffles the cries
with every ounce of strength left inside her sheryl bites down on deacons hand
he screams falling off of her
close on deacons hand blood oozes a large piece looks ripped out
sheryl spits the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth
deacon grabs the sickle axe starts towards sheryl
at the top of her lungs sheryl lets loose a blood curdling scream
ida bursts in the room
stop right there
deacon turns to ida stops his attack on sheryl
deacon slinks away
sheryl curls up in a ball emotions consume her
she breaks down
the sun sinks on the horizon
sheryls tied once again to the table
mike tied to a chair which is dragged into the room by clyde
sheryl sees mikes burned chest
this is getting out of hand yall
nobody wanted what just almost happened to sheryl to happen
but you keep dragging this thing out
things are gonna
i sent deacon away for a bit
he knows he done wrong
you say right now that you are ready to perform your marital duties then ill keep him away
have you ever thought that god doesnt want you to have a child
thats why he fucking kills them before theyre born
because youre fucking insane monsters that dont deserve a child
ida slaps mike
you take that back
take it back
ida digs her hand into mikes bear trap wound squeezes
but mike doesnt scream or squirm
he endures the pain
go ahead and torture me
theres absolutely no way i would ever give a child of mine to you
how very brave
i wont torture you
looks to sheryl ill torture her
i can bring back deacon
let him have her
plenty of other holes he can go into where a baby cant be made
ida grabs a nearby knife walks up to sheryl
or maybe we can just start dicing
all we need is a healthy heart brain and uterus
she dont need the rest of her fingers or toes
or her nose ears
i could carve out her eye right now
ida places the knife on top of sheryls cheek just below the eye
the tip just centimeters away from the eyeball
ida takes the knife away gets in mikes face
then you will give me my baby
my child born in wedlock saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear god and give him praise
sheryl starts laughing
inappropriate but nonetheless shes cracking up
has she finally cracked
thats why you married us
so we could conceive our child in wedlock
the fucking jokes on you
im already pregnant
eight weeks yesterday
clyde and ida stare disbelievingly at sheryl
mike stares in shock at sheryl
in that look ida knows sheryls telling the truth
i was trying to find the right time to tell you
tears fill both their eyes
no no no no
this cant be
clyde grabs hold of ida tries to calm her down
off screen a glass breaks
it came from upstairs
ida and clyde spring into action
they exit the room bolt mikes pov the pocket knife still on the floor
brody and lonnie stand on the porch
brody holds a shotgun lonnie a rifle
brody reaches inside the broken window unlocks it
we shouldnt just go in
brody slides open the window
im going in
you dont want to then dont
check round back or something
brody climbs inside
lonnie heads around the back
mike rocks his chair back and forth building momentum
finally the chair tips over
he uses his feet to push himself along
heading for the brody moves through cabin shotgun ready
alls calm quiet
lonnie walks in the back yard
nothing here except
on the ground lonnie steps on patch of ground thats different than the rest
lonnie peers curiously at the ground
whats he found
the trap door in the floor is open
he peers inside then proceeds down
lonnie bends down finds a handle
lifts reveal a hidden trap door entrance
lonnie peers inside
lonnies pov a dark staircase leads down
at the bottom a wooden door which is closed
mike hears this
lonnie takes a step down when
his body crashes through the closed wooden door into the hallway
lonnies body lands
eyes stare at mike
brody stares at the fetus jars what the fuck
the moon hides behind some dark clouds
a giant pile of dirt
the dead body of brody sits inside the makeshift grave
ida pushes lonnies carcass in next
clyde watches ida concern in his eyes
you know what we have to do
already anticipating no
i can give her an abortion
get rid of the bastard child make them conceive one in wedlock
and then we are right as rain
that we wont do
aint no sin to abort a demon
ida writings on the wall here
with a reward on the table do you think brody and lonnie will be the only two coming
gonna have lots people looking for these two
beat were gonna have to make it so no one can ever find them
ida and clyde
a sadness covers their faces especially ida
well find another couple ida
you promised me clyde this time was the one
its too dangerous
well find another couple

long beat its not fair
a crackle of lightning followed by a roll of thunder
ill do what needs to be done
you finish up here
and watch your time rains coming
clyde hands her the shovel
ida nods tosses a pile of dirt into the grave
clyde walks down the hall loads idas shotgun with a couple fresh shells
he unlocks then pushes open the door to torture room
mike sits in the chair exactly where he and ida left him
mikes head sags he appears to be sleeping
sheryl lies on the table out cold
clyde levels the shotgun to mikes head
but something odd catches clydes attention
on the floor behind mikes chair some rope shavings pieces
mike springs to life grabs clyde pulls him in
as clyde falls into mikes body
the shotgun fires mike swings his hand around plunges the pocket knife into clydes neck
the knife embedded in his neck
he throws his hands to it stumbles backwards and falls
clyde tries to speak but it comes out gurgling and bloody
believe me i understand your extreme situation but
punishments going to have to be handed down
mike aims the shotgun at clyde and
the blast takes half of clydes head and neck apart
mike stares at clydes body
ida stops she heard the two shots
the deed done
she grabs her shovel walks back towards the cabin
angle on the open shotgun as mike takes out the two empty shells
mike now next to clyde feels clydes pockets for more shells but there are none
what is it
no more ammo
mike glances around the room then spies
the knife he stabbed clyde with
he picks it up off the floor
off screen in the distance the iron door creaks open
ida approaches the room pushes open the door
idas pov the room is empty
angle on clydes dead body
ida drops by his side cradles his body
the love of her life is gone
before she know whats happening she turns
mike knife in hand explodes from torture room runs straight for ida but
ida swings the shovel knocks mikes legs out from under him
he trips and falls to the floor
ida gets up stomps down on mikes hand
the knife drops
from the hallway
sheryl looks out watches as
back in the room
ida grabs the knife plunges it deep into mikes calf
in for a penny in for a pound
i cant save your soul now michael
i gave you a way to cleanse yourself of all your sins and deliver you to heaven
and how do you repay me
ida takes the knife daggers it into mikes thigh
spots the shovel on the floor grabs it
there is no soul blacker than yours
and now by the grace of god i must deliver you to satan myself
ida retracts the blade pulls herself on top of mike
ready to stab again when
angle on the shovel blade sprayed with blood
ida falls over
sheryl and mike stare at her lifeless body
sheryl steps over idas legs
she takes a big step clears idas upper body
sheryl goes to mike wraps his arm around her lifts him up
but just as his foot touches the ground
a surge of pain cripples him
mike falls back to the ground
i cant make it
im not leaving you
thinks clydes walkie talkie
its probably upstairs
call the ranger base
remembers my gun
see if you can find our stuff
my guns in my backpack side pocket
what goods the gun

mike turns away
guilt etched on his face
theres another box of ammo
lets get out of this alive first then you can bitch me out okay
she goes to the ladder stops
mike looks at her
they stare at one another
its okay baby
sheryl turns ascends the ladder
sheryl exits the sewing room enters
sheryl searches the bedroom for the walkie talkie
a flash of lightning illuminates
in the window deacon appears
sheryl doesnt see deacon
she finds the walkie talkie
pushes button hello
come in please
we need help
is anyone there
rain beats against the windows pounds the roof
evelyn with poncho stands outside just locking the door when
is anyone there that can help
lowers the walkie waits for an answer
she heard something but not sure exactly what
she re enters heads over to the cb
just as she picks up the cb mic
deacon dripping wet appears in doorway lunges for sheryl
sheryl screams drops walk talkie as deacon tackles her onto the bed
the walkie talkie breaks into pieces
pushes the talk button on the cb
this is ranger base go again
sheryl and deacon
the headboard slams against the wall causing a crucifix to dislodge off a nail and fall onto the pillow by sheryls head
mike hears sheryl scream realizes it must be deacon
he lifts himself up using the wall as balance
deacon strangles sheryl with one hand
sheryls eyes bulge out of her head her face beet red
deacon raises the sickle axe into the air with the other
sheryls hand finds the crucifix and jabs it into deacons jaw
deacon grabs for the cross lets go of sheryl rolls off her the bed and collapses to the floor
sheryl coughs struggles for some air
she climbs off the bed runs out of the room
mike enters scours for a weapon
finds a machete
deacon yanks the crucifix from his jaw
blood squirts pours from the wound
sheryl runs in screams down the trap door hole
mike exits room passes idas lifeless body
trudges down the hall
each step painful
one hand covers his wound the other holds the sickle axe
sheryl grabs a candlestick uses it to defend herself
deacon swipes at her but misses
sheryl cracks him across jaw with candlestick
he falls but grabs onto sheryl
sheryl and deacon tumble crash into shelf wall with the fetus jars
they wobble shake then
the fetus jars break spill out everywhere
the shelf wall blocks the iron door from opening
mike looks up hears the commotion
it only quickens his pace
a path of blood left in mikes wake
sheryl shakes the cobwebs free opens her eyes moves her head slightly just as
sheryl scrambles to her feet when
deacon tries to push the shelf off him
it moves a little
sheryl limps up the trap door steps
mike pushes up against the iron door but it doesnt move
the shelf wall blocks it
sheryl races from the cabin
rain pouring down on her
angle on moonshine jar a lighter
the ones ida used earlier
deacon pushes the shelves again this time success
he gets to his feet grabs his weapon
mike with every ounce of strength left pushes at the iron door
it budges just a little
he pushes again and finally the door opens
mike scrambles into the chapel
deacon exits the cabin steps off the porch
he peers into the rain and the darkness of the woods surrounding the cabin
no sheryl anywhere
deacon turns looks up
sheryl a fresh tear in her dress holds the silver lighter in one hand the moonshine jar in the other
the moonshine jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out a homemade molotov cocktail
she glares down at deacon lights the cocktail
burn in hell you sonofabitch
she drops it
deacon flails wildly trying to put out the flames stumbles forward runs off towards the forest
he trips and falls just as he enters
the rain pouring down stares at
angle on deacons burning corpse lays in the thick brush
mike limps to her
he drops the machete collapses in her arms
they hug tightly
angle on a bloody hand grabs a poker from the fireplace
mike looks across the room
is steps from the shadows an iron fire poker in her hands
mike pushes sheryl to the couch safely away just as
ida sheryl turns away from ida runs to mikes side
mikes a bloody mess his life slips from him by the second
sheryl tears mikes shirt blood pours from his stomach
she finds the wound but has nothing to stop the blood
you did it baby
you saved me
you said you would and you did
stay with me mike
stay with me
barely audible love you
well if you love me
please baby fight
she looks around wildly spying
a wardrobe by the kitchen
ill be back in a second mike
sheryl jumps up races for the wardrobe
on a shelf are some towels linens etc
sheryl grabs the towels but as she does
she sees on the floor of the wardrobe
sheryl quickly rummages through her backpack
the fliers with the emergency contact info
sheryl drops down by mikes side
she leans in listens for breath sounds feels for his pulse finds one
very weak but its there
dont you even fucking think about leaving me alone
she presses the towel against his stomach wound all the while the phones pressed between her ear and shoulder
the no signal tone chimes in her ear
to mike come on baby
sheryl re dials only to get another no signal tone
oh please god
sheryl raises the phone into the air
sheryl hits re dial
the rain has stopped
a couple of rangers along with a paramedic unit surround the scene
sits completely still a paramedic works on her cuts and hand
she watches as
the other paramedics load a gurney into the back of the ambulance
a sheet covers the body
once inside the ambulances doors close
sheryl watches the ambulance pull away
she places her hand on her stomach
its just the two of them now
steps from the midst of the activity up to sheryl
she leads her away from the ambulance towards the ranger truck
called your folks
there gunna meet us at the hospital
be a while since theyre coming in from d
the words go straight through sheryl
sorry but i just have to ask
you told the sheriff there was someone in on this whole thing with clyde and ida
big fella scars all over him
no response mame
sheryls eyes meet evelyns
she nods about to continue on until she notices evelyns demeanor
what is it
changing topics youve had an exhausting night why dont you
hard cold what is it
we didnt find anybody like that in the yard or the house
concern growing no
its not possible
she turns looks around but spies nothing
its gunna be alright
fuck you its gonna be alright
sheryl turns to the woods holds her look
as if she knows
in the distance
past the trees deep into the woods
come to a rest over the shoulder of deacon
very much alive
he stares at the cabin for a beat then crosses out of frame
