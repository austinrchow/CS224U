written by carl franklin from the novel by walter mosley march rd draft a battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the
cap off a pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup
you know when you fire somebody you have to stick to your guns
they screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer
continuing the men might get to thinkin that im weak if i take you back
the cup rises to the face of benny giacomo late forties with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black
skin darker than a louisiana creole
he takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the whiskey
as he talks we gradually see more of him feet kicked up on the desk fully in charge
a betty grable like pin up girl is giving us background in more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a calendar tacked to the wall may
continuing and i didnt tell dupree that id give you your job back
all i said was that id be glad to talk to you if you said the right thing
do you have something to say
a stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a mans head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously
giacomo when one of the white guys has come off a double shift and says hes too tired to work overtime you dont fire him
fella whatd i tell ya
if youre not willing to give a little extra champion cant use you
easy rawlins thirty handsome and a much darker brown than giacomo takes a drag off a chesterfield cigarette
through the window behind him a team of men pour over a partly assembled airplane their voices echoing in the hangar that surrounds the office
benny measures out his words one at a time
easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about swallowing his pride as well
and then i want my job back mr
i need to work and i need a good job
is that all
easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep from bowing his head
no thats not all
i need money so that i can pay my mortgage and eat
i need a house to live in and a place to raise children
i need to buy clothes so i can im sorry fella but i gotta get back to work
and he swings his feet down and stands up to go
but easy is up too blocking his way out the door
my name is ezekiel
benny clinches his fists and focuses on easys chest like a fighter
and easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a field goal with his right knee
slowly giacomos face creases into a plastic grin and he shrugs
scuse me ezekiel
and he walks around easy shaking his head as if amused
easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from duke ellingtons absinthe snakes up like sin and we and watch the titles the last one reading
two weeks later
black and grey cars packards and buicks from to come and go on central avenue
two storied storefronts with canvas awnings above black men and women in hats
all in a hurry
the red car rumbles through and then a white cadillac convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop
above the shop on the next floor are large partly open windows with joppys bar in boldface letters
inside sits easy back to the window reading the classified ads
t bone walkers westside baby plays on the jukebox as easy takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out
the front page of the los angeles times lies face up on the table beneath the ashtray displaying a photograph of a middle aged white man and his pretty young
woman companion smiling and waving
above the happy couple is a headline carter drops out of race
the caption under the photo reads wealthy civic leader todd carter shown here with his lovely bride to be daphne monet at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for comment
on his surprising withdrawal from the mayors race
catch ya later joppy
an older black man hitching up his pants underneath a bloodstained butchers apron has slapped his empty beer glass down hard on the counter on his way out
hey watch the marble
dammit whatd i tell you
the fifty year old burly bartender leans over his big stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top of the bar with a filthy rag
behind him is a yellow billboard from with big black letters reading fuller vs
round main event
we could make out more of the poster and the eight by ten framed boxing photos around it if it wasnt so smoky in the place
joppy how much they payin out there at mcdonell douglas
i dont know
dont it say his words hang as his eyes stray toward the door
easy looks up also at the doorway which fills with the large frame of the white man in an off white linen suit his pale eyes surveying the room
satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the tiny room are unoccupied he smiles at joppy and walks to the far end of the bar
easy is surprised to see joppy tough ex heavyweight that he is duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like hes answering a summons
the white man extends a friendly hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in close to talk in private
easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks
after a moment
easy come on over here
this heres somebody i want ya to meet
this heres a friend of mine
easy drains his glass and stands up then walks over
this heres mr
you can call me dewitt easy
he extends his hand and easy shakes it
how ya doin
bowing and grinning mr
albright and me goes back to before the war when i was still in the fight game
to easy ever seen this guy fight
any time joppy shag stepped in the ring you knew you were gonna see some real knock down drag out fisticuffs
where you from easy
joppy pours albright a straight shot of wild turkey and the big man sips it
so i hear you need a job
easy throws a look at joppy but joppy is busy buffing the bar and putting more of easys business in the street
aw yeah easy always tryin to do better
got his high school certificate from night school
hes threatenin up on some college
and hes one of the few colored men around here who owns his own house
shoot he pays a mortgage every month just like a white man
property owner hunh
he turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the counter
continuing these big companies dont give a damn do they
he reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card and scribbles something on it
continuing if you need a job drop by this address at seven tonight
easy takes the card and glances at it
what kind of work you do
i do favors
i do favors for friends
he nods to joppy and walks out the door
who the hell is that joppy
just somebody i know
a bidness man
what kinda business
oh i dont ask him all that
he comes in here every so often looking for somebody to do a little job for him
he pays good
in other words hes a gangster
i didnt say that
but if theres a dollar laying in the street i dont think hell let a little dirt stop him from picking it up
if you worried about making that house note this month maybe you wanna pay him a call
all them pretty girls you be with aint gonna buy you a house
easy cocks his head are you crazy
continuing sound like he just wants you to keep your eyes open for somebody
hell pay you whether you see anything or not
if it was me id take that mans money and go on about my bidness
aint nothin to worry about
easy is still suspicious but cant take his eyes off the card
when somebody tells me dont worry i usually look down to see if my fly is open
i noticed albright didnt bother to pay for his drink
little single family houses with tiny yards of st
augustine grass rush toward the amber indianhead hood ornament on easys car
duke ellingtons mood indigo plays on the radio as easy heads for home in thought
continuing dewitt albright reminded me of somebody i knew back in houston
his name was raymond alexander but we called him mouse
mouse called hisself a businessman too
and i found out that i shouldnt be nowhere around when mouse got down to his business
i learned that the hard way
a neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at easy as he slows down in front of his house
he gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man giving goat cart rides washes past him in the street
a man with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind easy as he opens his gate
want me to knock down some of them trees back there for you
just leave the trees alone
easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his african violets in a jar next to
the front door
he walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket onto the sofa
then moves on through the kitchen and out the back door
he picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet watering and admiring his apple avocado pomegranate and banana trees as he lights a cigarette
i had moved to los angeles right after the war with three hundred dollars and the g
and i liked coming home to a place that was mine
according to president truman i had that comin to me cause i had fought in the good war against hitler in europe
but that didnt mean a damn thing to a lotta white folks including the foreman on my job
so here i was out of work needin thirty two dollars to pay the mortgage
that was three days pay on my old job and i had about three days to get it
easy parks in front of a large spanish style building
he gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance
easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses and vines cascading down from office windows on the second floor
someone is watching easy as he looks for the right office
a small white man pops out from behind a hedge startling easy
he wears a suit that also serves as a uniform
what are you doing here
im looking for uh
we only take deliveries between nine and six
yes we do
now youd better leave
he clutches a baton in his hand and swats it into his open palm
im here to see mr
wheres your delivery
he holds out his scrawny hand
i have an appointment im supposed to meet him
did he give you a note to come in here after hours
easy only stares hating this little man
well did he
because if he didnt forget it man
next time i see him ill just tell him you wouldnt let me in
disgusted easy turns to leave
he sizes up easy and then points across the courtyard
like an order across that way to the left and down the stairs
easy half nods half glares and walks away
at the other side of the garden easy turns a corner and heads down concrete steps
at the bottom he opens a door leading into he looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end
after a moment a tall and slight man with curly brown hair and the complexion of an east indian opens the door
a short and stocky kind of chinese looking man stands against the door at the far end
the tall man ushers easy into the clutter of heavy metal tools cans of paint and cleaning solutions
a card table with two chairs sits idly
the tall man closes the door and holds out his hand
easy reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat easy on his side and easy pushes him away
whats wrong with you
the chinese man slips a hand inside his coat and the tall man smiles
with an accent mr
rawlins put your hands up a little from your sides please
keep your hands to yourself
i dont let no man feel on me like that
the chinese man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and takes a step forward and the tall man tries to put his hand against easys chest but easy grabs
dont worry manny
just a little shaky
indicating the door let him know
manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the door behind him
after a moment dewitt albright opens up
he doesnt want us to touch him
leave it shariff
i just wanted to make sure he was solo
youre the boss
you guys can go now
easy and i have some business
easy follows albright inside and the big man goes behind a big wooden desk and puts his bone colored shoes up next to a half full bottle of wild turkey
on the other end of the desk a small radio scratches out the glen gray orchestras gotta be this or that
there is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him with a picture of a basket of blackberries but other than that the room is bare
have a seat mr
easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under albrights arm with the muzzle of
the pistol almost reaching his belt
gesturing back your friends hunh
like you easy
i need a little help
i give em a call
albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours a fresh one for easy and fresher one for himself
one thing i like about working for myself
i always have a bottle on the table
you wanna drink with me
doors right behind you
joppy tells me youre a war hero
said you went in with patton
easy nods proud but polite and albright pushes him a glass of whiskey
so you want the job
depends on what kind of job
i dont want to get mixed up in nothing
walk out the door in the morning easy and youre mixed up in something
only thing that matters is if youre mixed up to the top or not
i mean i dont wanna get mixed up with the law
neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that
thats just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place
he laughs and takes a healthy swig and easy takes a drink too
im looking for somebody for a friend
he pushes a newspaper across the desk to easy and easy holds it up
its the front page with the photograph of the wealthy todd carter and his beautiful bride to be
despite her smile theres a sadness in the eyes
fiancee of todd carter one of the richest men in town
been gone for two weeks
she leave him
you know how it is with women easy
happens to the best of us
he rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of recognition
i aint never heard of her before
i wouldnt know how to find a woman like that
thats a shame
he laughs a conspiratorial lechers laugh and easy allows a smile
see daphne has a predilection for the company of negroes
she likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat know what i mean
the insult takes easy off guard but he shouldve known
so you think she might be down in watts
im sure of it
but i cant go looking for her myself because im not of the right persuasion so to speak
ive been asking joppy for over a week but all he could do was introduce me to you
what do you want me to do
just get a location on her
carter wants to make up with her
smiling thats all
he pulls out a brown secretary type wallet and counts out ten dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey
one hundred dollars and i pay in advance
easy eyes the money
all he has to do is pick it up
i just have to tell you where she is
and keep it you know confidential
he freshens easys drink and easy eyes the money some more
joppy tells me you used to frequent an illegal club down on eighty ninth and central
somebody saw daphne there a few nights ago
you could start tonight
easy takes a drink and looks again at the money
stripped down to its dark naked self central avenue has drawn a crowd from all over town
neon glistens off slick pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh
an outrage to police even before the era of police chief parkers personal crusade a squad car sits idling while two dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey
sharkskin zoot suit prodding and whapping with nightsticks searching for something anything because his date is a young white woman
a few onlookers stand back watching but since this white woman is not daphne monet easy only glances and walks inside
easy sees his fifth white man that day in a disheveled but expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him reeking of gin
hey colored brother
i need you to do somethin for me go on
whatd i tell you about hair assing my customers
easy looks over to see hattie parsons the small brown skinned manager of the place glaring daggers at the drunk man while watching the commotion out the window
easy starts over toward hattie and the drunk turns and tries to grab easys arm
but his desperation causes him to trip and he winds up sitting against the wall
easy steps over him and joins hattie at the window
i just paid these damn cops and they still roustin my customers
well thats what he gets for being with that white woman
she walks over to the cash register of this neighborhood corner store and easy follows the drunk beckoning him to bend down to talk as he passes
come on brother help me
dont worry bout him
i rung junior ten minutes ago to come get him
easy pulls out two dollars and hattie deposits them into the till
i aint got nobody tonight but lips and his trio holiday came through here last tuesday
heavy footsteps are heard pounding down a stairway in the back of the store and big burly junior fornay lumbers in with a cigarette hanging from his lips
wheres he at
hattie points to the drunk man as he struggles to get to his feet
let easy in upstairs and when these cops leave throw his ass out
whats goin on
not too much
but stick around
junior leads the way back up the stairs
you got a cigarette
he pulls out his pack and stops to light easy up
easy starts coughing as they continue up the stairs
how do you smoke these things
dont you hafta work tomorrow
i got fired
a hint of a smile appears on juniors face
the last time i heard these fellas playin tonight was back in houston the night your ole buddy mouse had to pull me up off your ass
easy grins and shakes his head
thats the way you remember it hunh
hell thats the way it was
and he stops to unlock the door
continuing when you gonna admit that you helped mouse kill old man navrochet
aw man get off that
i aint had nothin to do with that
junior opens the door and lips alto horn slaps easy in the face
half of houston texas seems to be jammed into this place
boy its happenin tonight
wheres all the white women at
i dont pay them white girls no mind
i bet you dont
and he steps in
just like you didnt help mouse kill his stepfather
go on man
and he starts away inside
did you help him kill his stepbrother too
easy turns to glare at junior and the surly field hand slaps his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door
after all these years the two men still hate each other
easy looks around to see couples trying to dance finding themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six people each
he heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black silk shirt and a foot high pompadour hairdo
alphonso flashes pearls
hey man you seen a girl named dahlia or somethin
white girl supposed to be somethin to look at
naw but if i see her im gonna keep her to myself
easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny rita cook who is sitting at a table with five men
under his breath what do they see in you
finally easy spots a fifty year old man in an old grey tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself
looking like the god fearing all fearing baptist deacon that he is he is as out of place as a whore in church as he nervously gazes about the room
and massacres a plate of barbecued ribs
easy leans over the counter to the bartender
gimme a couple glasses and a pail of ice and send a quart of bourbon over there to odells table
lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto the bar with two short glasses
easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up over to the corner as he watches
burn it up
easy stops at odells table
hows it going tonight
odell doesnt miss a bite as he scopes the crowd
its goin alright
it sure is goin
easy rawlins is that you
easy looks up to see dupree a big black man with a wide white grin in a white suite with blue pinstripes and a ten gallon hat
you aint jumped outta no windows yet
not yet dupree
miss you down at the plant
you know coretta dont ya
he has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy smile
short and roundish with cherry brown skin she leads with her bosom
hey coretta how are ya
coretta rests her sloe eyes on easy and odell and the church going man almost chokes
oh my goodness
could we sit down with yall
dupree and coretta settle in
you know benny just wants you to say youre sorry easy
and hell give you your job back
im a sorry man all right
any man without his paycheck is sorry
dupree laughs smacking the table so hard it rattles like an earthquake
and corettas smile ignites like a slow fuse causing easy to feel it all the way down his spine
a man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a quart of old crow from his overcoat and sits it on the table
easy reaches for his wallet but dupree beats him to it
i got it easy
your money aint no good up in here
this ones mine you sure
you the one outta work
coretta frowns at dupree as easy counts out three dollars
and youre the one aint never got no money
to bootlegger get us another couple glasses
and he peels off a dollar and hands it off
either one of yall seen a white girl named dahlia or somethin with a d
odell shakes his head no and coretta looks away as if insulted leaving silence until hey coretta got a new job at the phone company
he squeezes his woman in close and coretta softens up and burns that smile again
easy grins and nods congratulations
its less than a quarter full now because its three hours later
johns is only half full and the band is gone
the jukebox echoes lena hornes prisoner of love and dupree leans back in his chair snoring mouth wide open
odell gets up and starts to amble off
hey you goin home odell
concentrating totally on keeping his balance odell waves feebly without looking back
easy is droopy eyed from the booze but coretta just looks a little sexier
she straightens duprees hat on his head and twists up her nose
he used to play till the cock crowed
but that ole cock dont crow nearly so much now
she levels her perpetual come on onto easy and he nods sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet
think im gonna head out
you be sorry if you go
she slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts her bodice to air her breasts
i think id be more sorry if i stay
he turns to go
daphne sleep by now
you cant get none of that tonight
easy turns and coretta plays with the ice in her glass
you been telling everybody dahlia but her name is daphne
you know her
coretta leans back and fans her bosom
easy struggles with dupree and coretta gives him a hand as they drag him from easys car to her front door the big mans feet plowing two deep furrows in
coretta pushes the door open and easy hauls him in
throw him in there on the bed easy
easy pulls and pushes duprees dead weight into throwed him outta his place cause he couldnt pay the rent
i shouldnt even let him sleep here
finally easy manages to pile dupree onto the bed and then stands up panting and sweating
coretta leads him out into i need a cigarette
coretta shines her hazel eyes on him
that all you need
easy grins nervously and clears his throat
coretta sun catch me tip toein out your door and no tellin what your neighbors say
dupree run through his money fall asleep on me
and you just gonna walk out on me like i was dog food
you got a man in the other room
why dont you tell me bout your friend daphne
coretta strolls up to easy pressing her body against his
why you keep askin bout her
colored women aint good enough for you no more
she undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest and unbuttons another working her way down
easy sweats harder than when he was lifting dupree
what if he hears somethin
way he snorin
oh yeah daddy
you hittin my spot
the top of her dress undone coretta is straddling easy who is hitting her spot and his too in a rhythm
eyes closed he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to awaken dupree who is sawing logs shredding em in the bedroom
suddenly coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on his knees
easy writhes and shakes like a power line shorting out
coy shy oooh thats just too good easy
easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the floor
i cant give up that much love daddy not the way things is
out loud what things
she shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the bedroom
you know duprees right there in the next room
full voice forget about him
you got me goin coretta
coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses
but it aint right easy
here i am doin this right in the next room and all you doin is nosin after my friend daphne
and then remembers oh yeah
i aint after her baby
thats just a job
man wants me to find her
who cares what man
i dont want nobody but you
he pulls her toward him but she pushes him away
but daphnes my friend frustrated he sits back against the sofa and coretta sensing that he is snapping out of her spell slides forward onto him giving him her spot
and within moments they are back at it
oh daddy you hittin my spot
i went on hittin her spot until just before sun up
the sky is light purple as easy stumbles down corettas porch
she waves half heartedly and closes the door as he straightens his clothes and looks around for any witnesses on his way to his car
easys pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out
it occurred to me that coretta had found out a lot more about what i was up to than i had wanted her to
but i had found out that the rich mans woman had a colored boyfriend
it had cost me a sawbuck to get coretta to give me that information
well lets just say somethin had cost me ten dollars
golden morning light streams in through the window
outside a dog is barking at a bird on the fence
coffee percolates on the stove and easy walks over and pours himself a cup
he moves to the breakfast table and sits down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens up a blue envelope in a stack of mail
gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading aloud
since etta mae has left me and i am a bachelor i figured i could come out and visit and we burn down the town
write me and tell me whens a good time
looks up aw shit
easy waters his lawn in deep thought
the letter from mouse was worrying me in more ways than one
all i had to do was call albright to earn the hundred dollars i already had in my pocket
but the last time i got money that easy i got it from mouse fifty dollars and the next day i had to join the army to leave town
a younger easy is driving his hair greased up high in a pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip
a man in a wide brim homburg hat looks away out the passenger window
drive to the trainyard easy
lets dump this damn thing
suddenly alarmed this aint your friends car
whatd you do mouse
still looking away just drive this sumbitch
the drone of the engine takes us a truck with a whole familys belongings tied down onto a flatbed rolls up
a woman and a bunch of kids fill up the cab
where you goin sophie
back to texas
its too fast for me out here
she waves and keeps on trucking
he watches her wistfully and then catches sight of the woodcutter across the street in a neighbors front yard axe in hand about to swing on a lemon tree
get away from there
he picks up a rock and throws it and then chucks another sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down the street
easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch
he picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a chair on top of a front page heading reads carters withdrawal leaves teran on top
below it a photograph of a smiling matthew teran with lips too thick for a white man getting out of a limousine
the phone is ringing
its easy is asleep on the porch
finally he wakes up to the ringing and heads into the house
easy flops on the bed and lifts the phone off a cherry wood nightstand
rawlins ive been expecting your call
i hope you have good news for me
albright is that you
sure is easy
easy clears his head
he has slept away the day
i got what you want
shes with hold on to that easy
i like to look a man in the face when we do business
meet me at the fishermans pier in malibu at the hamburger stand in an hour
i dont know about that mr
he realizes that albright has hung up and swears under his breath
the headlights from easys car illuminate the cliffs that fall alongside the winding two lane highway
easy is cautious checking the rearview mirror more often than usual
i wasnt used to going to white communities like malibu to conduct business
champion aircraft was in santa monica but i drove out there in the daytime did my work and came home
i never loitered nowhere except among my own people in my own neighborhood
the lights from the pier can be seen in the distance as easy parks his car
and the voices of teenagers in raucous conversation can be heard above glenn millers big band playing silhouette in the moonlight on the jukebox
easy gets out and starts toward the pier
easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing that looks out over the ocean
he spins around and sees a chubby year old white girl in a tight fitting skirt
he nods respectfully and turns away to look out at the water hoping shell leave
its pretty out here huh
its all right
im from des moines in iowa
where are you from
without looking back huh
do they have an ocean in texas
the gulf they have the gulf
she leans on the rail next to easy and he glances over his shoulder seeing a couple of the young men looking around like theyve lost someone
i think theyre looking for you
my sister brought me cause my parents made her
all she wants to do is make out with herman and smoke cigarettes
what are you doing
the five foot six inch twenty year old charges straight up to easy
yelling leave him alone herman
we were just talking
you were huh
to easy we dont need you talking to our women
easy braces himself as five of hermans friends rush over including one built like a football player
niggers trying to pick up barbara
leave him alone
we were just talking about the ocean
football gets right in easys face
hey fella whats wrong with you
a couple of the other boys have picked up sticks and are surrounding easy against the rail
i dont want no trouble
you already got trouble boy
i was just being polite
no you werent
you were talkin about the ocean
easy sees albrights panama hat appear behind football
what do you want
and he whirls around to albrights smiling face just in time to see him pull that rifle like pistol from inside his coat leveling it at his eyes
i want to see brains
i want you to die for me
albright cocks the hammer
it sounds like a bone breaking and barbara starts crying in her sisters arms
quickly im sorry sir
easy nods but albright is not satisfied
the question is are you sorry enough
then prove it
get down on your knees and suck his peter
football starts crying
to albright i think he got the point to football you heard me
he presses the barrel to the boys forehead and football goes down to his knees
the other young men look on in horror
son of a gun
you were gonna do it werent you
he slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of the boys head
football screams and the others scatter
he smacks him again and blood is everywhere
get out of here
you call the cops ill kill ya
football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away into the darkness back out toward the parking lot
albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it back into the holster
i dont think theyd dare call the cops
giggles but itll cost me a few bucks if they do
he claps easy on the back as if its all been in fun and giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand
easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside clutching his anger in tightly clenched jaws
what you got easy
you sure no harm is gonna come to that woman cause of me
albright doesnt break stride
carter wants to buy her a gold ring and live happily ever after what do ya got
easy exhales feeling trapped but hes come this far
woman told me shes with a man named frank green
albright stops the charm gone hes all business
hes got an apartment at the skyler arms on skyler and eighty third
albright scribbles it down on a note pad
franks a gangster
liquor and cigarettes
hes real good with a knife
albright is unable to suppress a smile
ever seen him in action
i just heard about him
albright still grinning pulls out the brown secretary and counts out more bills
heres another hundred
he shoves the money into easys hand
buy ya a burger easy
he starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but easy declines
no thanks mr
how come you let those boys get around you like that
war hero should have been able to pick em off one by one before they got you against the rail
i dont kill children
for some reason this is hilarious to albright
he throws his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh then winds down
take it easy
he disappears into the hamburger joint and easy walks away back toward his car
easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark ford parked across the street as he gets out of his car
a tall skinny white man in a dark blue suit gets out just ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset friend
easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway
they approach fast but cautiously the fat one with a hand in his pocket
rawlins im miller and this is my partner mason
they both hold out badges
mason is a slob with grease spots on his wrinkled tan suit
we want you to come with us
and he takes easy by the arm
you arresting me
and he starts pulling easy toward the street
i got a right to know why youre taking
easy takes one to the diaphragm and as he doubles over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his back
you got a right to fall down and break your face nigger
you got a right to die
the two cops drag easy to the car and dump him into the back seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away
easys head sags down as hes dragged through the front door past blurred blue bodies that talk
you got im huh miller
yeah we got him coming home
nothing on im
a door opens and easy finds himself being flung inside
on his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a single bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum floor
he crawls to one of the urine stained corners and looks down on a dry flat corpse of a mouse
he pushes his shoulder against the unpainted plaster until hes standing and then stumbles over to the chair and sits
he looks up at the bare pipes that run along the ceiling dripping water and at a window with criss cross chairs instead of glass framing overgrown branches and leaves
pushing their way in
the door opens and miller comes in first carrying a notebook
mason follows and closes the door
we can take off the cuffs if you wanna cooperate
miller motions to mason and he removes the cuffs
where were you this morning at about five a
stalling what do you mean
he means he plants his foot in easys chest and pushes him over backwards
easy has caught himself and stands back up
i dont know
i was out drinkin and i helped carry a friend home
i couldve been on my way home
i dont know
i didnt look at a clock
wandering over he didnt look at a clock
easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep his balance wiping away blood streaming down
you were drinkin down on eighty ninth and central
at an illegal club called johns werent you
mason moves again but this time easy turns to face him and the fat man looks back with an innocent face his palms turned up
you may as well answer cause you got bigger troubles than us bustin an illegal bar ezekiel
what do you mean
whats goin on
mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the palm of his hand
means we can take your black ass out behind the station and put a bullet in your head
what time did you leave coretta james house this morning
i guess about five
miller and mason glance at each other and mason kicks the chair over toward easy
why im gonna sit down and you keep trying to knock me down
but he sits down anyway
did you go back and see miss james later in the day
did you and dupree brouchard have words over miss james
you heard im
did you two argue over coretta james
he was asleep
she went to sleep too ezekiel
but she wont be waking up
easys face goes sick
continuing whered you go when you left miss james house
easy is too stunned to answer
you heard him whered you go
easy stares into space answering in barely a whisper
i went home with a hangover
mason fires off two punches and easy grabs his wrists and pulls him down to the floor swinging around straddling mason sitting on his ass
millers police special presses into easys temple and miller speaks to him quietly deadly
get up slow
real fuckin slow or you know whats gonna happen
easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet backing away cautiously
mason is winded and furious
lets take him out back
he gets to his feet and reaches for his gun but miller stops his hand
bullshit im gonna blow his lets go
he pushes mason toward the door
son of a bitch
son of a bitch
they exit the door and easy rubs at his bloody ear
easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his top shirt button his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep out the chill of the night air
the street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the curb
a taut faced officer leans out the window
its a long walk
why dont you let us give you a ride
easy walks across the street off into the darkness
a snatch of music and laughter startles easy as he trudges home and a car full of teenagers shoots by
cruises up behind and drives alongside
the window rolls down all the way and a white face in a black cap appears in the window
ezekiel hold on
easy keeps walking
come on fella
somebody in the back wants to talk to you
i dont have time right now
he doubles his pace almost running
well take you
my boss wants to talk to you
easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the other side of the bridge but
the cadillac whips a u turn blocking his way in the middle of the street while cars pass honking on either side
the tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his hands as if making peace
easy starts to make another move to escape but continuing come on
if we wanted to hurt you it would have already happened
he opens the back door and after a few moments easy gets in
easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver
edith piafs parles moi damour adds sugar to the strong smell of cologne and the portly form of matthew teran sits across from him with a small mexican boy in
pajamas seated next to him holding a small elephant
i can see that the police roughed you up a bit
thats a terrible practice of theirs which has to change mr
has to change
he opens his gold cigarette case and offers easy a cigarette
easy accepts and teran lights them both up
continuing she was beaten
and died from a heavy blow to the back of the head mr
easy begins to feel nauseous
the evenings events have caught my adopted son and i quite off guard
my household was asleep when we got the call that the police had a suspect in coretta james murder
did you know that she was a friend of mine mr
no i didnt mr
oh you know who i am
i read the papers
youre runnin for mayor
correcting i am the next mayor mr
and luckily for you a friend of the negro
when i arrived at the station i knew right off that you were being improperly detained as is corettas boyfriend dupree brouchard
its this sort of thing that my administration will not tolerate mr
absolutely will not
he sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod of assurance and awaits easys gratitude
then after a moment
coretta answered phones for a while in my campaign office on rd and western
in fact my people got her a job in the phone company
so when i heard what had happened i got out of bed immediately personally because of my concern
was anyone there with you mr
rawlins besides mr
other friends of corettas
no young lady perhaps
of course not mr
and why should you tell a man whom youve only just met
but believe me mr
you can trust me
shrugging there was no one else
terans face sags with disappointment and then
well dont worry mr
i wont tolerate your being harassed
you or any of my constituency i was a city councilman in the watts area for two terms with a large contingent of colored i value all of my supporters
humble though they may be where can we drop you mr
you can let me out here
are you sure mr
this must be quite out of your way
the little boy stares up at easy through big dark almond shaped eyes in the silence that follows
and then teran picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head
norman pull the car over
the limousine stops and easy pushes the door open and gets out
rawlins may i offer you cab fare
terans stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills
easy closes the door and watches the long cadillac glide away
there had been nights during the war that i still had trouble claiming as part of my life
insane nights i wasnt sure ever really happened
and here i was again
had i really just gotten out of a rich mans car who was runnin for mayor
running against the man i was supposed to be working for
was he really lookin for the same woman i was trying to find
my ear was killin me and the buses had stopped running
and i was feeling sick
sick from wondering if i had really hard that coretta was dead
the room is a mess trousers strewn here shirt and shoes over there
and from the corners are haunting ghostly whispers
you be sorry if you go
heavy breathing i cant give up that much love daddy not the way things is
a pint of bourbon full sits atop the cherry wood nightstand
another empty bottle lies next to it on its side in front of a water glass with inch of liquor at the bottom
easys head rests on a pillow on the bed behind it sweating tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder
oh yeah daddy
you hittin my spot
the voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear
oh thats just too good easy
the voice is right up in his face
oh daddy yeah
oh yea a h
he jerks up awake and the phone is ringing
it jingles a couple more times and easy almost knocks the receiver out of its cradle reaching for it
a womans hello
is this mr
who is this
he sits straight up
youre looking for me
a pause on the line
i think you should come and talk to me mr
look its late mr
rawlins coretta has been killed
and if you dont want any trouble from the police then youll come
and you wont tell anyone that youre coming
now wait a minute daphne
i dont know nothin about all this stuff
im at the sunridge motel on th and grand room
easy holds his hands up helplessly what do you want from me
but no one can see and she has hung up the phone
its a spanish style set of rooms with tile roofs set around a square parking lot
easys car pulls into the alley behind it
he gets out and scans the area looking down from a rise at the back entrance to the parking lot
and then walks down
before easy can knock he hears mr
the door opens and shes standing there more beautiful than the photograph
they take each other in for a moment before she steps back from the door
please come in
its a regular drab cheap motel that she has given a warmer touch with colorful scarves draped over the two lamps
would you like a drink
she indicates a pint of scotch on the dresser with an empty glass and one that shes been drinking from
she indicates the chair
please sit down
shes wearing a blue dress thats plain cutting just below her knee with a ceramic pin just over her left breast
what happened to you
have you been fighting
easy stubs out his cigarette in an ashtray and sits down
why dont you just tell me what you want
she sits down too her calm but brittle exterior betrayed at the hands
she stops wringing them when she sees that he notices and takes a drink more medicine than pleasure
i should be asking you that question
why have you been asking about me
i heard about you
fellas at johns said you were something to see
youve found me
guess i have
but you got a boyfriend i dont want no part of
she lights a cigarette
you can stop pretending mr
i know someone hired you to look for me
in fact i had to pay coretta not to tell you where i was
you know how coretta is
forces a weak smile she told me you two became good friends yesterday
tears gather in her eyes i talked to her this morning before she died
regaining control i
need to go across town to see someone
its very important
i cant seem to reach him by phone
im afraid id better have someone go with me
miss monet call me daphne
daphne i can understand why youd be nervous
because i threatened you with coretta
im very sorry but i couldnt think of any other way to get you to come
she takes another drink and stubs out her cigarette though its less than a third gone
i cant why dont you ask frank
she gets up and starts to pace nervously about the room
hes out of town i
im willing to pay you
thats nice of you but see im not really a detective i know that
i was just hired to ask around to try to find you for a man i know all about that mr
but this is a gettin a little out of hand mr
if you dont help me then ill call the police and tell them that you were with coretta before she died and that youve been after me too
that stops easy
youd do that
yes i would
i dont want to but i would
she hates herself for threatening and decides to change direction moving in close
please let me pay you
i cant do that
i dont want no part of all this
please ill pay you twenty dollars
or even more
name your price
she moves in closer massaging with her voice
continuing go ahead
theres gotta be something that you want
her eyes make an offer but hes a better man than me and hes not taking
angrily sarcastically what
are you afraid ill yell rape or something
she walks away and turns up her glass her desperation raw unguarded
uh miss monet
daphne im sorry but i really better be goin
he starts out and she runs to stop him
easy dont touch that door he opens it and scream
like an alarm shes shrieking all of the scale
he looks out and sees lights going on in other rooms
he looks back frantically and grabs her by the shoulders
crazy assed broad
what the hell are you doing
im really very sorry
i really am
she pulls on a coat and grabs her purse
continuing i didnt want to do this but
she grabs an already packed suitcase and is out the door
easys pontiac snakes up the winding road city lights glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves
ben websters ive got it bad plays on the road as easy shifts nervously in his seat his eyes searching in the rearview mirror and all around for headlights that
might be unfriendly
daphne leans back against the passenger door taking him in
easy passes a police car pulled over to the side
he looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on
he takes a deep breath bracing for the worst and daphne looks back concerned
but the lights arch a u turn and head back the other way
they must not have seen us that well
god frank and i have been pulled over so many times i thought she catches herself and looks over at easy
continuing easy im sorry
dont be mad at me
easy keeps his eyes on the road
continuing come on
she tries to touch his arm and he pulls away
continuing you really hate me dont you
how much further is it
around the next bend
she grins you remind me of frank when he gets angry
aint nothin about me like frank
your jaw sets just like his when
i dont get no kick outta risking my life for some white womans entertainment
sighing just park behind the studebaker
the studebaker is parked at a deadend in the street
easy pulls in behind
the cabin is so overgrown with ivy that all this is visible is the mailbox and address
did you bring a gun or something
easy thats not very smart
everybody carries a weapon now a days
defensively well then wheres yours
search me sometime
youll find it
she gets out of the car
he frowns and gets out of the car
daphne waits clutching her suitcase and lets easy lead the way
they get to the door and find it ajar
easy takes a look inside and then cautiously steps in
he flicks on the wall switch
its a typical little hideaway that the rich kept for summer use
the living room dining room and kitchen are all in one with a long counter separating the kitchen
on the left is a wooden couch with a mexican rug thrown across it and a metal chair with tan cushions for the seat and back
the opposite wall is all glass with the city lights blinking in the distance
easy leads them to a door and opens it
another wall of glass and a dead man spread out on the king sized bed with the contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room
oh my god
she gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her mouth in case she throws up
easy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth and nose as he gets a closer look at the body
its the drunk white man he had seen at johns speakeasy in the same blue suit
hes lying on his back like a crucifix with a butcher knife buried in his chest
theres blood that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like jello
easy actually does throw up and doubles over dropping to a knee to keep his balance and some control
he stays there for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt
he lifts it off the floor and smells it
he wipes his mouth with the handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in his pocket
he gets up
he hears a car engine start up and gears shifting
then runs out the door
a pink studebaker whips backward out the driveway
easy runs alongside trying to stop daphne as she screeches into the street
hey wait a minute
she speeds off down the canyon
he stands in the middle of the street watching her go
fiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into easys face as he turns the corner onto his block
he is surprised to see a white cadillac parked in front of his house
and now its his front door thats open
he pulls in behind the caddy and gets out
he pushes open the door
shariff loiters just inside grinning at him and manny stands in the middle of the living room looking at the floor
from a radio in another room tommy dorsey plays blue skies with frank sinatra out front
and so easy walks past the two hoods into albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand
easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at albright smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in the same clothes he had on at the pier
what you doin in my house man
i expected you to be home so manny used a screwdriver on the door
what happened to your face
you got no excuse to be breakin into my house what if i broke into your place
still smiling id tear your nigger head out by its root
easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour himself a cup of coffee
so what do you want
where have you been this time of morning easy
i went to see a girl
dont you get none mr
the smile leaves albrights face and his eyes turn even colder
i didnt come here to play boy
you got my money in your pocket and weve been over at that address waitin all night for frank green and now weve found out that he moved from there
over a year ago
easy is scared and confused but he plays it off
so what do you want me to do about it
you dont think i did my job
shit i give you the money back
and he reaches for his pocket but albright reaches too and suddenly manny and shariff are in the room and on easy like a vice
albright presses the barrel of the
against easys forehead
do you believe in god easy
cause im curious to see if death is any different for a religious man
easy looks down away from the gun and swallows hard
i seen her
after a moment everyone relaxes and easy sags out from under their grip and staggers into manny and shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair and albright
stalks in holstering his gun
she called me
had me drive up to the hollywood hills
howd she know about you
i guess coretta
the girl that told me about daphne and frank green
why didnt you call me
she threatened to tell the cops that i had killed coretta
albright looks over at his henchmen
where is she
she took off
dangerously where is she
i dont know
while i was looking at the body she split
nodding uh hunh
albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the corners but he is not surprised to hear about a body
you call the cops
i tried my best to keep in the speed limit
thats all i did
whatd she do take his car
did she take his car
easy hesitates how did albright know his name
whered you pick her up at
she left that place write it down
to his shame easy flinches and gets paper from his end table then scribbles down the address and hands it to albright who takes easys seat and examines the note
get me some whiskey easy
easy studies albright who sits knees wide apart now the master of the house and he cant help himself
get it yourself
bottles in the cabinet
albright looks up and easy braces himself for albright to bring on the end all at once
but slowly a smile spreads across albrights face and he laughs stamping his foot
well ill be damned
get us a drink manny
easy youre a brave man
i need a brave man working for me
but you gotta find frank green so he can lead us to her
no thanks mr
people are gettin killed all around me
you never said anything about all this
easy youre connectable to two murders
youll do whatever i tell you to do
manny brings albrights drink and the captain turns it up and gives manny back the glass
continuing now you got three days to find him
and you make sure you count em right
he walks out the screen door with manny and shariff following
easy grabs the bottle from the counter where manny has left it and pours himself a stiff one
but he only stares into the glass
dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in a struggle
the boom of heavy artillery gives way only to the deafening chatter of automatic fire
we are hurtling forward into a horror stricken easy in combat gear repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless german soldier
tears are streaming down easys face his mouth gaped open in an inaudible scream
he studies the glass and pushes it away
albright and his two goons get in the white caddy and cruise away
he dials the operator
i needed help
albright didnt flinch at hearing that coretta was dead and he seemed to know all about richard mcgee too
raymond alexander on
he pauses speechless as yes
after a moment forget about it operator
he hangs up his eyes trained in thought
a crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three convertible car caravan the first car bearing a four place band playing happy days are here again the second
with someone who could be lana turner holding up a teran for mayor placard with a man in the front passenger seat announcing through a megaphone and last but hardly least matthew teran blowing kisses and waving two small american flags
easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car to watch the parade
then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the waistband at the small of his back under his jacket
he walks with a purpose into the open door next to the butcher shop
easy stops in the doorway seeing joppy as usual buffing the marble top of his bar
t bone walkers they call it stormy monday is on the jukebox
he scans the bar and sees that there are no customers and walks in
easy stops at the bar and stares at joppy
that girl called me last night
what girl is that
the one your friend is lookin for
thats pretty lucky hunh
wasnt no luck at all
it was you
joppy inadvertently clenches his fists and notices easys aggressive stance
you and coretta was the only ones that had my phone number who knew i was lookin for her
and coretta was busy scammin daphne so she wouldnt have done it
it was you man
maybe she looked in the phone book
i aint in the phone book joppy
joppys eyes narrow
what the hell you mean coming up here all mad like you gonna do something
yelling you damn right
your friend albright is on my ass
the cops done brought me down once why didnt you just tell albright your damn self
yelling back what did i tell you
to just take that mans money
i didnt tell you to do nothin
i call myself trying to help you save your house
dont come up in here startin no shit with me
and he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar but easy has pulled his hammer and smacks it down hard cracking the beveled wood that frames the marble
continuing panicked easy wait
watch my marble
my uncle left me that when he died
and goddammit hes about to get it back
he draws back for the downswing and joppy drops the baseball bat holding up his hands
lets just talk
what you got me into joppy
joppy inhales forcing himself to be calm
she asked me to help her cause i told her that albright was lookin for her
and i figured i could help you make a few bucks and throw albright off the trail too
she wanted to know something about you so i told her
i guess i mustve give her your phone number
where is she man
i dont know
dont lie to me joppy
i aint lyin
i dont even know her that good
she just asked me to help her
and she asked me not to tell nobody
i guess cause of her and frank green
whats she runnin from joppy
i swear i dont know
she didnt tell me
i didnt mean to get you into nothin easy
i mean you seen her easy
man shes something else
easy can see sucker written all over joppy as he fumbles for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with disgust as he lights up
is there any white woman that ever gave you the time of day that you wasnt a sucker for
joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar
easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished institution on a bronze plate
he parks the car and gets out adjusting his dark brown stetson which matches his pin stripped suit
he looks around at the massive and well manicured grounds and walks into a patio area of this spanish style complex
albright had said that when youre mixed up in something its best to be mixed up to the top
i could see his point
so thats where i was going
all the way to the top
an elderly secretary descends an outdoor curved stairway carrying a file
she spots easy looking around confused and immediately becomes annoyed
may i help you
i came to see mr
do you have an appointment
no i dont
well im sorry but mr
carter is a very busy man
easy pulls out albrights business card and hands it to her
well tell him mr
albright sent me and its real important
she looks at the card and then up at easy with annoyed superiority
may i ask the nature of your call mister
but im not so sure hed want me to tell you
im quite sure mr
rawlins that whatever you know is nothing i cant know as well
well anyway tell him im here with information about that little chippy of his that dumped him
is this some sort of joke
easy and the secretary turn to see a tall man in a dark grey suit with bushy black hair and thick eyebrows standing in the doorway
he forces a smile and comes out
rawlins was it
he holds out his hand and easy shakes it
to the secretary ill take care of this
and back to easy why dont you come with me sir
they walk through the door into not very smart talking about mr
carters business to a secretary
i dont wanna hear it man
its too much goin on for me to give a damn about what you think is smart
baxter bristles up and slows down his walk about to put easy in his place
but easy slows down too and squares up on him
baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone staircase
baxter ushers easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda overlooking
alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside is todd carter
baxter walks out and speaks with carter while easy watches them from inside the office
the rich man perks up with interest and hurries inside with baxter who throws easy a dirty look on his way out
he pauses uncertainly wearing a simple sears roebuck looking tan suit with a plain open collared white shirt
the dark circles under his eyes show nights without sleep
he runs a hand through his thinning red hair and offers an overstuffed sofa
they sit on either end
distraught has something happened to daphne
the last time i saw her she looked fine
you saw her
shes still in town
she was last night
what did she say what was she wearing
a blue dress
and a pin on her chest
yeah on the left side
carried away oh yes thats her
you know ive never known a woman who could wear perfume so slight that mr
carter what did she say
what did she say
oh im sorry
he points to a crystal decanter near easy
easy pours himself a drink and takes in carter as he wrings his hands to keep from going to pieces
this guys got it bad
i came here to get some answers
i dont know
im takin a helluva chance
carter runs his hand through his hair again the suspense killing him
continuing i guess its just that when im working for somebody i wanna know what im gettin myself into
carter leans in as if he missed something
i beg your pardon
well id like to know the real reason why mr
albright hired me
after a moment mr
the man you hired to find daphne
there must be some mistake
im sorry busy
who are you talking about
easy and carter stare at each other not sure how to proceed
you didnt hire somebody to find your girlfriend
until just now i was sure that she was hundreds of miles away from here
you say someone is looking for her
easy nods his brow furrowed in thought
carter gets up and walks to the door looking out into the canyon
half to himself someone is looking for her
whats goin on between you two
carter shrugs and stammers nervously
i dont know
we were going to be married
we had a fight
then recovering uh
thats none of your concern mr
he stops and looks to the floor the gravity pulling him down
and he said hes working for me
do you know a man named richard mcgee
i cant say that i do
why would someone be after her mr
i cant say i dont know
hes lying and easy knows it
continuing do you think you could find her again
i dont know
its important mr
rawlins for her sake
im willing to pay you
carter why did she leave
i cant tell you any more mr
rawlins ill pay you to find her
easy thinks about it and then nods
a thousand dollars
a thousand dollars
ill take two hundred right now
i think youre trying to take advantage of me
but left me inform you that the incumbent mayor and the chief of police eat at my house regularly
then they can help us no
carter is too emphatic and easy waits for him to give more but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon
ill have baxter write you out a check
after a moment mr
carter whyd you stop runnin for mayor
terse ill have baxter write you a check
why is matthew teran looking for her too
with finality baxter will write you a check
easy takes him in and then holds out his hand
ill take cash mr
carter fumbles in his wallet and too nervous to count the money shoves the wallet at easy
take it all
just take it all
easy nods and strides out of the room
easy walks to his car gets in and drives away toward the entrance
so albright was working for matthew teran
and whatever teran had on carter was strong stuff
too strong even for carter to go to the police
but because teran was desperate to find the girl too that gave me the best hand
i had seen her once and if i played it right id see her again
easy talks to the short squat suspicious woman who runs the place
through the smoke other distrustful eyes fix on him from pool tables and dark corners
everywhere i went was a familiar place but different because i was asking about buying hijacked liquor from the man nobody wanted to talk about
upscale with a balcony
billy eckstine fronts the band
blacks and whites are dressed to impress including easy who leans into the bartender
it was actually looking more and more like i might not make it through this little adventure i was having
but i was likin the chill in my blood and the freedom of working on my own
the two jewish owners unveil for easy a case of hijacked liquor in a wooden crate
there were times in the war when i had felt like this
when life or death where the only two choices
that made it simple
and that was alright by me
easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open
hes tired and he trudges up the walkway to the porch
he sees the woodcutter standing on the front lawn of the next door neighbors waving at him
he throws a rock and then unlocks the door
but he notices the pot of african violets lying broken on the cement
he looks up just in time to see a two by four swing down
and easy is seeing stars
a big man dressed in black kicks open the door and drives easy head first into easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way of
a lethal crack
of the board onto the floor
he grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who catches it on the arm and keeps on coming snapping a blade from his fist which leaps out
like a chrome colored flame
easy scrambles back his head butting up against the couch his forehead streaming blood his eyes wide with the sight of sure death advancing
wait a minute
i need to talk to you
frank looms over him his sinister but handsome brown face framed by a short rimmed black stetson hat and a black shirt and coat
he holds the knife to easys neck letting the blade press into the skin as he talks
you the reason why she told me to lay low hunh
easy buries himself back against the sofa
machine gun quick naw
i got five hundred dollars for you
rich man wants to talk to a white girl you know
franks eyes flame and he presses the knife drawing blood
you a dead man
easy you in there
franks head whips toward the door and easy knocks the knife away and comes up tussling
frank scrambles to get away and easy tackles him straining to keep frank from reaching the knife
the front door springs open and spats on patent leather shoes clump in the last one stomping down on franks outstretched fingers
frank screams and cradles his hand in agony
easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at mouse dressed in a plaid zoot suit with broadway suspenders down the front of his shirt a long barreled
caliber pistol held loosely in his hand
want me to kill him
exhaling relief mouse
aw man naw its all right
well whats happenin
he holds out his hand and helps easy to his feet
frank makes a slight move towards the knife and mouse levels the pistol at his head his gold rimmed teeth glittering from a smile that wants frank to go for
ill blow your goddamned nose off
to frank wheres daphne monet
frank just stares up at easy his eyes sharp and defiant
look if you dont know where she is maybe we can help each other find her
after a moment mouse cocks the hammer
nigga you heard him
dont kill him
the phone rings next to mouse and he picks it up eyes still on frank
hes busy right now you gonna have to call back
he hangs up
frank a rich man she knows is willing to pay a thousand dollars just to talk to her
a thousand bucks man
frank still wont talk and that does it for mouse
he releases the hammer
easy lemme try
he slaps frank upside the head with the pistol
you stupid easy grabs mouses arm and frank slumps to the floor
let him go
get out of my way
let him be
the two friends struggle and frank rears up and plows into easy sending him sprawling to the floor on top of mouse
then frank covered in blood hurls himself across the room out the door
mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the pistol but its too late
easy stands up and mouse points the gun at him
damn you easy
dont you never grab me when i got a gun in my hand
easy silently eyes the pistol and gives mouse a chance to calm down
after a moment mouse looks down at his jacket
look at the blood you done got on my coat
why you wanna go and do that
he looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase
then spots the bathroom and moves to it taking off his jacket and hanging the pistol in his belt
easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and catches his breath as mouse runs water in the bathtub
now we got to find that girl so we can get that money
no we dont mouse
i dont need your kinda help or i wouldve called you
mouse comes out of the bathroom scrubbing at a spot on his jacket with a washcloth
you standing there with a knot on your head the size of a twelve year old tittie and you dont need my kind of help
angrily this is the same shit you pulled five years ago when you asked me to drive you out to your stepfathers house then come to find out you killed
him and your stepbrother
aw easy that was a long time ago
easy glares at mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a handkerchief
after a moment come on easy
cut me in on this
i could help you
i let you run the show
i swear i will
he ambles over to easy apologetically and holds easys shoulders with both hands
i swear i aint gonna do nothin you dont tell me to do
easy knows he cant believe this but everything i say
everything you say
with no choice easy nods and walks into he runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror dabbing at his forehead
who was that called
i dont know
sound like some white girl
easy turns toward the door aw man
mouse in a plum colored double breasted suit and a brown felt derby hat turns on the radio and the ink spots well meet again purrs out
he starts to turn the key but then remembers and honks the horn
easy opens the door and stands on the porch
hey easy was it a left on richland or a right
and if dupree aint over there in compton just come on back cause i might have heard from the girl
just then a car cruises around the corner and easy watches mason and miller pull up across the street and get out
he glances over at mouse
mouse shuts off the radio and slumps down in the seat out of view
easy watches them stroll up the walkway
we came to ask you a few more questions
grinning so why dont you just invite us inside
holding open the door after you
and easy and miller go in
what happened to your head
i dont remember doing all that
he laughs and closes the door behind them
miller looks around suspiciously
the room still shows signs of the struggle with frank green
he exchanges a look with mason
been having a party ezekiel
mason pushes easy into the chair and miller plants his foot on the seat between easys legs and leans in
you got a lotta cuts and bruises to be an ordinary working stiff
its looking worse and worse for you my friend
what do you know about richard mcgee
on the other side of the room mason picks up a chunk of the broken lamp from the fight
a dead white man in a cabin in laurel canyon
mason comes over and stands over easy next to his partner
he fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp threatening
he hangs out with some of those same nigger friends of yours down on central avenue
easy eyes the sharp edge making up his mind to kill this fat son of a bitch if he gets too creative and die with him
he just happened to have a note in his pocket with c
james written on it
he holds the slip of paper up for easy to see
any of this making you feel talkative at all cause ill bet ya six bits to a bottle of piss that were looking at a double here
all we need is to place you in the dead mans house
i aint been there
i aint been in no dead mans house
miller stands back and pats his pockets for a smoke
how bout a smoke ezekiel
easy taps out one and miller places it in his mouth
got a light
easy pulls out his lighter and sparks the flame
easy shrugs and passes the lighter to miller who fires himself up
he holds the lighter out of mason who wraps it up in a handkerchief
and we got our print
what do you mean
oh hadnt you heard
we found a cigarette lighter in the dead mans house with the killers fingerprints on it
total disbelief naw man
i didnt do it

frantic i didnt do it
you know i didnt
and miller leans in hard
we know that you know more than youre lettin on
and now a white mans been killed
now you better tell us what you know or youre goin down for the murder of richard mcgee and coretta james
he straightens up and easy stands up too
shouting i dont know nothin
to mason put the cuffs on
lets take him down
as mason reaches for the cuffs easy sees mouse peek out from the kitchen doorway then disappear inside
i dont know who did it
but we do
he sees mouse draw his gun his eyes trained on millers back
and thats all that counts
dammit i didnt do it
tell it to the d
mouse is trained with the hammer cocked and easy is about to give the signal but then look gimme some time to find out
gimme till tomorrow
miller thinks about it and then
tomorrow morning thats it
he nods to mason and easy looks up to see mouse raise the gun and slide back into the kitchen
mason unlocks the cuffs
have a nice evening ezekiel
and he and miller walk out
easy looks out the doorway watching get in their squad car and drive away
b he turns back to see mouse standing in the living room
b wearily i guess you know what would have happened if you had shot them two cops in my house
shrugging hell yeah
theyd be dead
easy shakes his head
come on lets go
he grabs a jacket
easy hurries out of his house pulling on his jacket with mouse right behind
what they tryin to pin on you
ill tell you on the way
you got the keys
and he hurries around to the drivers side
before we run out to compton we got one other place to stop by
he freezes seeing the woodcutter watching and listening
to woodcutter man dont you mess with my trees while im gone
he gets in as mouse cranks the engine
you heard me
leave my trees alone
as mouse starts away the old man smiles mischievously and starts to sharpen his axe
easy leans out the car window yelling back as the car pulls away
i mean it now
dont you mess with my trees
its a horseshoe of tiny apartments with over a dozen little porches and doorways staggered in a semi circle around a small yard that has a half dozen stunted magnolia
trees growing in brick pots
easy and mouse step into the courtyard passing elderly tenants sitting inside screened doors
jimmy luncefords im walking through heaven with you floats out into the yard
they arrive at the closed door of number eight
easy knocks and then knocks again hard
something crashes on the inside and heavy footsteps pound to the door
the door opens and junior fornay stands there behind the screen door in blue boxer shorts and a white t shirt
what you want
its private junior
and he reaches to pull open the door but junior throws the latch
i aint got time now
im tryin to get some sleep
why dont you open the door junior fore i have to shoot it down
mouse steps out into the doorway in plain view
we aint got all night
junior forces a smile and lets them in
filthy and junky with old car parts scattered amongst old furniture the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a dim light just like junior
yall want a beer
he nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws two others into place on his way to the refrigerator
easy and mouse sit down and junior brings over a quart of pabst blue ribbon beer and two glasses that he wipes out with a rag
what ya smokin
junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into the glasses for easy and mouse and drinks from the bottle
easy unfolds the handkerchief in his pocket on the table uncovering the cigarette butt from richard mcgees house
to junior this is one of yours aint it
junior looks at the butt and shrugs
you the only one i know cheap enough to smoke this shit
whyd you kill richard mcgee
what you talkin bout
aint no time to play junior
i know you the one killed him
you crazy man
and he stands up to emphasize his indignation
sit down junior
junior shifts awkwardly from side to side and then sits back down
tell me what happened junior
i dont know what you talkin bout
well the police will
when they find out that they got your fingerprints up there in that mans house
hattie had you pull that man out of johns the night i was there
and he was laying up there dead with the same suit on and a knife in his chest
i aint killed nobody
quit lyin you big ole sweaty thick headed cornbread eatin mouse cant keep from laughing and junior starts up after easy
you thick headed ya damn self
but mouse is up still laughing with the pistol in his hand
sit down man
fore i blow your brains out
what kinda shit yall trying to pull here
last warning sit down
junior sits down and throws himself around in the chair like a child throwing a fit
you better tell it the way it happened
and maybe ill forget what i know
otherwise im gonna tell mouse to shoot ya cause you know i dont like your ass and he dont like you either
mouse slaps the table laughing so hard hes in tears
and he aims the pistol and cocks the hammer causing junior to throw himself around some more
you killed him to take his money didnt ya
i dont even know who you you just had to rob him didnt ya
i didnt touch nothin in his house
but its in the open now and junior frowns and shakes his head
hattie had me take him out to his car
and he say he give me ten dollars to drive him home
mouse is busy working a toothpick between his front teeth
i know you took that
then he asked me about that white girl you was askin everybody about at the club
and i told him i seen her with coretta
what the hell i care if he know
you tell him but you wont tell me
i dont like your ass easy
and he gimme fifty dollars
disbelievingly fifty dollars
just to tell him you seen her with coretta
to deliver a letter
easy is stopped for a moment
how should i know
he just said to give it to her
and you knew where she was
i didnt say that
i give it to coretta to give it to her the next mornin
you spect me to believe that
why would he trust you to give it to the girl if it was worth fifty dollars
cause he had to blow town fool
easy stops to make the connection
he didnt say
after a moment you better be tellin the truth
lets go raymond
he and mouse get up
im tellin the truth
i aint killed nobody
that man was alive when i left him
easy opens the door looking back at junior whos still going on and walks out
compton looks a lot like texas with unpaved streets and little country styled houses set back away from the road behind vegetable gardens and chicken coops and small sheds with
a horse or a cow tied up
easy and mouse pull into the gravel driveway of a little house and are met by the usual barking dog you find in the country part spaniel part shepherd and
some kind of retriever
it dogs easy and mouses heels as they get out of the car
they notice the light in the front window go out and the shade pull back slightly as they walk toward the front door
moments later the door opens and the dark figure of dupree brouchard appears
to the dog go on
go on in the back
the dog obeys and easy and mouse walk up the walkway
been trying to call you
cops just let me out today
my sister gone to work and i didnt feel much like talking
hey big man
them pigtails i smell
lula mae made some fore she went to work
dupree ushers them in
duprees face under the kitchen light shows two swollen black eyes from a brutal police questioning
his eyes are heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks
why somebody wanna kill her like that
i dont know dupree
i dont know
dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of mouse who swallows half the shot without looking up from his plate of food
easy declines when the bottle comes his way feeling the pressure of time running out
did coretta ever say anything to you about a letter she was keeping
what kinda letter
for that white girl
but i know it was on account of her that coretta got killed
easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and mouse looks up from his pigtails
dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger
continuing everything between coretta and that daphne was always such a damn secret
i mean that ole girl didnt think nothin about two timin on frank
she probably innerduced coretta to one of them ole guys she knew
and when he came to the house after coretta
starting to break he found out she wasnt that kinda woman
cops said she fought him
aw my gawd
fought him cause she wouldnt have nobody but me e e
he buries his face into his hands and easy throws a sad but frustrated look to mouse
continuing aw gawd i cant even go to sleep
cause i can still see her face that mornin fore i went to work
junior had been by and just left the house
and she came runnin out to the car carrying her bible
and she said keep this for me baby
easy and mouse exchange looks
and dupree falls apart
continuing police wont even let me go near her house
so its the only thing i got left from her
it was a sign
i know it was a sign cause she was so religious
its all right big man
its all right
and he pours dupree a half glass of rye
barely a corner of whiskey lies at the bottom and dupree is snoring like a buzzsaw sound asleep
mouse squints into his glass wondering why its empty and looks down the length of the kitchen leading into drawers are pulled out on the dresser and easy is rifling
through another until he pulls out a bible
he fans the pages finding already opened
his fingers pull out a photograph and then two more
his excited face goes sick and he silently mouths holy shi it
i was as nauseated from fear as i was from what i saw
pictures of a much younger matthew teran and children
innocent helpless naked children
easy hurries in holding up the letter
i got it
come on i think that girl is gonna call again
that dupree is a good man but he sure cant hold his liquor
easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on stuffing the letter in his coat pocket
you got your sails up pretty far too raymond
you callin me drunk
well you been puttin it away along with him and if i was drunk could i do this
and in less than a heartbeat he has pulled that long barreled pistol and is aiming it at easys forehead
aint a man in texas can outdraw me
forced calm put it down
and he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster
go for your gun
lets see who gets kilt
i dont have a gun raymond
come on lets go
you fool enough to go without a piece then you must wanna be dead
he lays the pistol on the table then draws a
automatic from his waist this time cocking the hammer the muzzle only inches from easys head
easy can tell from the glazed look in mouses eye that instead of seeing him his friend is glaring at some demon he carries around in his head
so he stands stock still
quiet soothing let him go raymond
he done learned his lesson
if you kill him then he wont have got it
he fool enough to call me out and he aint even got no gun
ill kill the motherfucker
let him live raymond and he be scared whenever you walk in the room
motherfucker better be scared
i kill a motherfucker
i kill him
easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment until mouse blinks then nods and lets the pistol fall down into his lap
his head on his chest hes sound asleep
easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other
then walks to the doorway and turns out the light
the dim street lamps of easys neighborhood streak past as easy scans the streets and sidewalks wary for anybody who might be staking him out
the pictures were burnin a hole in my pocket
i had no doubt that albright had killed mcgee
and that he had done it for matthew teran
but teran hadnt known who killed coretta
i was sure of that too
easys car pulls up and he gets out and looks around cautiously before starting up the walkway
continuing for the first time i hated walking up to my house
i still didnt know if i could go to the police
but albright was liable to be showing up in a few hours asking about frank green
i was thinking i oughta forget the girl and leave town back to houston or galveston where they didnt know me too good
easy gets to the door still literally looking over his shoulder and hears the phone ringing inside
he unlocks the door and bursts in
he races through the dark living room and into and picks up the phone but the dial tone drones on the other end
he whacks the nightstand with the receiver dying with frustration
and something moves in the dark
he lunges and grabs and pulls her into the light then sits down onto the bed before the shock can knock him down
are you all right
easy shakes his head in disbelieving relief and she reaches to touch the bump on his forehead
your boyfriend frank green threw a surprise party for me
im sorry easy
he pulls away
continuing easy corettas boyfriend dupree got out of jail today
continuing he joins her i need you to help me you need me to help you find him
easy shakes his head amused and lights a cigarette
i already have the pictures
daphne stiffens as if from an electrical shock and then easy i paid seven thousand dollars for those pictures
they belong to me
matthew teran may have somethin to say about that
easy you wouldnt dare
who killed coretta
i dont know ill pay you for them
ill give you a thousand dollars
you gave richard seven
okay ill give you seven
whered you get seven thousand dollars from
ill give it to you
theyre very important to me
corettas life was important to a few people too
whats say you tell me who killed her
easy honey i dont know
do frank and carter really fall for that stuff
you and todd carter have a fight and all of a sudden he doesnt wanna be mayor no more
you leave hes worried but he cant even get his buddies in the police department to help him find you
and now you wanna buy some pictures of teran
cause hes got some dirt on you
she gets up and walks away
easy why dont you just take the money
is that what frank told coretta
she whirls around to face him
continuing was she being too nosy
or was she just being coretta and trying to bargain up the price
how much do you want
is frank your husband or your pimp
she swings and open hand across his face and smack
he returns the gesture sending her back onto the bed
he picks up the phone and dials o
easy put the phone down
why dont you try screaming again
cause i bet police like white women with negro boyfriends who hijack trucks
she reaches for the phone and he pushes her away
i bet they like pimps and whores too who scam rich white men like carter runnin for mayor
easy please put it down
and im sure they like it when these white girls tell their colored men to lay low cause they killed a woman over some pictures of another rich white man
she gathers herself just as number please
soberly frank is my brother
easy is about to speak but then stands still
he hangs up
she looks away worn out tired
we have different fathers
mine is white
frank doesnt even know that todd and i broke up
so far ive kept him out of all this
she gets up and takes easys cigarettes and taps one out
see corettas the only one out here in l
besides my brother who knew about me
she lights up and about a month ago she took a job working for of all people matthew teran
she made friends with one of the girls in the office who told her that shed heard that teran was a pedophile
and coretta got carried away and told her that todd carter was engaged to a colored woman
she was sorry and didnt think it would get to teran
but it did and he got a hold of my birth records
who killed her daphne
daphne exhales smoke and brushes hair out of her face ignoring the question
continuing todd and i broke up and i paid a guy for the pictures of teran
but somehow coretta got them
who killed her
it was an accident
coretta and i were still mad at each other
i mean she threatened to sell teran the pictures
who killed her goddammit
i just asked joppy to go over and put a scare in her
it was an accident
joppy points a finger in corettas face backing her against the counter
she grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left out to dry
joppy said she pulled a knife and tried to dump hot water on him
she swipes at joppy and he backhands her against the stove
she struggles to grab a pot of boiling water but he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against the counter her head striking the tile on
the way down
daphne looks down at her hands
she stubs out her cigarette and sits on the bed
god i didnt mean to hurt anybody
its just that with the pictures i can what
be white again
dont judge me easy
do you think i like pretending that im someone else
do you know how ive been treated by people colored and white when ive tried to live as a colored woman in a colored community
do you have any idea what any colored man whose ever been with me has had to go through
dont you dare judge me
she sees easy hesitate and she stands up
continuing come on easy
she moves in close caressing
continuing come on you know its the right thing to do
you know if things were different what would happen between us
ill tell you what can happen between us
you get carter to clear me up from all this and you can have your pictures
thats all that could have ever happened between us
genuinely hurt sure baby
of course sweetheart
the sound of the front door pushing open startles them and albright knocks on his way in
well ill be damned
you found her
and manny and shariff step in too carrying baseball bats
wait a minute albright
daphne breaks for the back way and easy tries to bar shariff from going after her
manny swings the baseball bat into easys side
and easy yells and plows into him wrestling him against the wall
albright grabs easy from behind and pries him free enough for manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of the bat
easy sinks to his knees seeing double
shariff leads daphne back into the room her face contorted into tears her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock
to daphne where are the pictures
terrified i dont know
he backhands her
easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and manny swings the bat down into his kidney
where are they
indicating easy i wouldnt tell him
and i wont tell you
sure you will
to shariff lets go
shariff leads daphne outside and manny draws his forty five automatic and trains it on easy cocking the hammer
whatre you doin
who are we gonna give em to cover this shit hunh
use your head
he shoves manny through the door and pushes easy onto his side with his foot and hes out the door
easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and the sound of a car engine growls to life
he thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the count
he gets it open in time to see
the blurred white form of albrights caddy screaming away shattering the dark shrieking in flight
dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the block
easy stumbles back inside and into
where he manages to dial the phone
it rings several times on the other end and finally groggy yeah
slurring get duprees car
drive it to th and central
the butcher shop
he puts down the receiver missing the cradle and staggers out of the room
easy is ripping through the night the streetlights flashing by in blurs of light
the windows down hes coming to
it had come to me in less time than it takes to think that albright was taking daphne someplace more isolated than that office building downtown
someplace where there would be no witnesses
and i was being left alive to take the fall
the street is still alive
a couple of late night juke joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party onto the sidewalk to straggle home
easys car screams around the corner and then skids in sending a heavy hipped young sister about to cross the street scrambling for cover
he jumps out just as mouse scorches the tires on duprees packard in behind him
to the woman sorry baby
lemme give you twenty bucks for them stockings you got on
it takes a moment to register but when she sees him pull a twenty from his pocket she gets busy
he runs back to mouse
gimme one of them guns you got
mouse smiles loving this side of easy and trades him a set of car keys for a
continuing start up my car
im comin out fast
he runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the twenty grabbing one of the nylons leaving her still stripping as he runs into he takes the
steps two at a time pulling the stocking down over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the open door leading into he charges through the raucous laughter of the half full room right up to the bar
joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face
come on joppy
joppy hesitates recognizing the voice
you heard me
ill blow your head off
and he cocks the hammer causing joppy to get a move on from behind the bar
easy shoves him through the door calling back to the startled crowd on his way out
dont follow me goddammit
and hes gone
easy hides the piece in his coat pocket as he bum rushes joppy to the car
easy what the hell you shut up
and he shoves joppy into the back seat getting in next to him
drive this damn thing mouse
mouse pulls off around the corner down the street into an alley
mouse pulls to a stop
to joppy albrights got the girl
hes gonna kill her
where would he take her
and you better get it right
man i dont screaming pressing the gun dont fool with me man
theres a cabin out in malibu on route
make a right mouse
the car roars down the alley and turns right onto the street
to joppy you sure bout this place
i guess so
hes done this kinda thing out there before
easy whats done got into you
thought yall was friends
he killed duprees girlfriend
son of a bitch
and he pulls out his pistol aiming it back over the seat at joppy as he drives
the bullet slams through the rear window just to the side of joppys head
whatre you doin
this one digs out a chunk of upholstery between joppy and easy
the car screeches to a halt and mouse tries to aim again
but easy struggles with mouses gun hand still holding a pistol on joppy
mouse we need him to lead the way
this one rips through the roof
joppys yelling afraid that easys gun will go off
mouse the girl offered me seven thousand dollars for the pictures
mouse glares into the rearview mirror
no i swear im not
and he fumbles with the ignition and shifts gears
oh my god
oh my goodness
the engine roars from a punch to the accelerator and mouses voice can be heard cutting through the darkness as the car powers off down the street
oh my goodness
easy with the gun on joppy strains to see the dimly lit road in front of them
is that it up there
yeah thats it
the headlights bounce off a signpost route
the pontiac makes the turn onto a graded dirt road
a ranch style cabin emerges up off the road drawing nearer in the headlight beams
shut off the headlights mouse
mouse kills the lights
is that it
its farther up
how much farther
another ten minutes i guess
easy i swear i aint done nothin to nobody
i swear i aint
through the windshield house lights show through thick shrubbery
there it is
mouse pulls to a stop and kills the engine
theres some rope in the trunk raymond
mouse gets out of the car and is heard opening the trunk
easy come on man
that girl is lying if she told you i killed them folks
who said she told me
its muted and distant
but its a woman all right
easy pushes out of the back door on the right as mouse opens the opposite door on the drivers side
stuff this in his mouth
i gotta get up there
he tosses mouse the stocking
lets just shoot him
on the run no mouse
and theyll hear it
the cabin draws nearer as easy scrambles up the hill
he can hear daphne crying out something but he cant make out the words
it quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a window with the shade pulled down
he moves cautiously quietly to the window and peers through the crack between the shade and the windowsill
he can make out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low ceiling
and daphne screams again
come on talk to me
talk to me while you still can
i dont have them
easy has them
easy can barely make out shariff passing the window
he strains to see more
you said he didnt know anything
i was lying
grab that for me shariff
and then scre e eam
the kind that drops the bottom out of your stomach
the kind more akin to fear than the word itself
the kind that fries your skin with the cold chill of horror
s c r e eams again
no o o o
no o o
now talk to me goddammit
no o o
easys gotta make a move
he smashes the window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up
manny looks right up at his face as daphne arches and flails trying to get free from his hands that are pinning her down on a battered old sofa
albright is holding a glowing red poker that shariff standing in front of the fireplace has just handed him
easy starts blasting
manny takes one to the throat
albright and shariff lunge for cover and daphne ducks down behind the back of the sofa screaming and screaming
manny hand to his throat pulls his gun on reflex firing into the floor and then half runs half staggers out the side door just ahead of another kablaam
that digs out a chunk of the wall
easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down getting ready for manny who should be coming his way from the side door
he hears more steps stumble out and then
and then kablaam
two huge blasts rip right through the wall next to easys head and he scrambles to the side of the house underneath another window with the shade pulled down
to shariff who the hells out there
getting frantic i dont know
that you easy
tell us what you want buddy
see what we can work out
easy hears footsteps coming alongside the house where he had been moments ago
albright has fired from the inside again thinking its him
but its manny clutching his throat gurgling for air stumbling aimlessly off down the hill
a walking dead man
easy hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a moment the gurgling stops
hey buddy then to shariff come on goddammit
daphne cries out and klablangle
easy breaks the window with the gun but kablaam
the windowsill tears out above his head and daphne screams again
easy looks up to see shariff holding her in front of him as a shield
hes headed straight for easy drawing a bead on him for the kill
and then kablaam
the back of shariffs skull flies off and mouse is in the side door blasting
albright breaks for the window
the slug spins him halfway around but he hurls himself through the window backwards
easy scurries to the front of the house and blaam
the bullet goes wide and albright manages to get into his car and returns fire
easy hits the deck
albrights engine roars to life and he squeals out on the gravel
mouse appears on the other side of the house and click
hes out of ammo
he pulls out the other pistol but its too late
damn damn damn
i hit him
i hit him
easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front door
easy finds daphne standing in the middle of the room her whole body quaking in shock
he takes off his jacket and drapes it around her
you all right
her top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise on her cheek
she jerks her head nodding yes
as he leads her through the doorway he stops to look back at shariffs legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the sofa
he leads her down the front porch and hears
theres blood all over here
i got him
mouse gets up from squatting down grinning the gold rims of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through the door
he looks daphne over admiring
easy leads her past quickly
mouse opens the back seat door of the car and easy sees that theres no one there
and then he looks around quickly seeing joppys body lying off on the side of the road
i didnt have time to be tying him up
daphne sees the body too and starts gagging
easys face twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to daphnes mouth
you just said dont shoot him
and i didnt
i choked his ass
easy helps daphne into the car and closes the door
how im gonna help you back there foolin round with him
he was tied up
if you didnt want him kilt you shouldnt have left him with me
and he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get in
unlike up at the house this was murder the same as it had been in texas with mouses stepfather and brother
tears of rage well up in easys eyes as he hears the car door close
daphne sits in the car her eyes staring straight ahead still in shock
a few people hurry to board the train easy and mouse among them
i convinced mouse to take the two oclock train to pomona and to let me handle everything else
he could get a train back to houston later that morning
he was fine with that but only because he was seven thousand dollars richer
daphne had gotten the money out of a locker at the ymca without a word
because she was still in shock and couldnt really talk
maybe too because she had stolen about four times that much from carter
listen if you think you gonna have trouble with that dude frank i can run by and kill him and take that evening train to houston
he has had enough of mouse for a while
this is for you
and he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag from his coat
i cut you in for half cause i knew you was too big a fool to take your share from that white girl yourself
easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it
the conductor gets on board and the train starts making those metal on metal sounds
send my grip to etta mae
im gonna see if shell take me back now that im flush
he slaps easy on the shoulder and boards the train
oh heres the keys to duprees car
he tosses them and the train starts moving
and if you need somebody to run them streets with ya gimme a call
you know how to put some money in a niggas pocket
and he laughs flashing gold teeth pulling away
i knew i would see him again and i didnt know how i felt about that
cause unlike mouse my legs were like rubber
the way they had been in the war the whole two years i was there
easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette rubbing his aching chin looking out at standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium
carter wanders after daphne explaining while she paces back and forth in anger
i could tell how it was gonna go when carter asked us to meet him at the observatory instead of at his house
she knew it too
but she had come this far and she had to play it out
suddenly daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back toward the car
carter follows behind
he starts over too but then stops knowing heres no use
she gets in
come on easy
easy throws a look over at carter
continuing dont worry you can give him the pictures yourself
and she throws them down on the seat
easy fires up the engine and pulls away with daphne looking straight ahead
hey im sorry
the slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the tears flow
the sun is coming up over the city below
for the first time i felt that i could fall in love with her too
i was even wondering if it was starting to happen when i dropped her off at rd and dinker where her brother frank was waiting
then it occurred to me that she still had carters money
and i felt like a fool
easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching kidney
a secretary comes out to meet him and as she leaves todd carter and a group of men in business suits converge on him shaking hands
evidently carter had told all his cronies about the pictures because they were all smiles and handshakes and how do ya do
the mayor the police chief
the newspaper land developers
all the men who ran the city and who really stood to gain by who was the mayor for the next six years
the group fans out leaving carter and easy alone to walk off down a hallway
spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not so spectacular view of the mountains
its cold and official like the job itself
carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket not unlike albright
heres the remaining eight hundred that i owe you
and another thousand which i hope will keep this whole thing
easy nods a tentative sure
continuing and ive taken care of your problems with the police
youll have no more trouble there
and thats a promise
easy nods and starts to go but
continuing to easy mr
did daphne ever say
she loved me
easy shrugs not knowing how to answer
would it really matter if she did mr
carter nods sadly and easy walks away leaving him a lonely figure amidst all his power
easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the granite steps
id been thinking about daphne too
wondering if she meant what she said about what could have happened between us
but at the moment i was wondering if there was any such thing as a sprained chin
but other than that and a headache a loose tooth and a kidney that a doctor would need to look at i felt like five thousand three hundred dollars
and unless albright was alive somewhere that feelin was gonna last a while
miller and mason are waiting outside their car at the curb
they come over
you got some mighty powerful friends up there
but see we got a problem
easy listens disinterestedly
continuing with the chief sealing these things up like this it doesnt do much for the morale of the men whove been working on these cases
makes em feel like shit
theres a guy whos been callin on the phone
and were pretty sure that he was up there with mcgee
sounds kinda dumb
correcting not very bright
but he said you accused him of the murder
and he swears you were up there too
in fact hes out and out pointing the finger at ya
how about a name
hed do it to you
easy waits to make sure theyre finished and
but i gotta go
he starts away
continuing why dont you go back to the station and uh
wait around for my call
you son of a bitch
you watch yourself you hear
dont you even spit on the fucking sidewalk
i better not even masons voice fades under
it might be the last moment of my adult life spent free was walking away from city hall
a newspaper headline reads carter back in race
the subheading reads quiet civic leader returns as flamboyant teran quits
the paper treated the mysterious flip flop like it happened every day
and i could tell that matthew teran wouldnt spend a day in jail
back in the second section of the paper was a small article about an unidentified man found dead slumped over the steering wheel of a white cadillac just north of
further back we see that odell is reading the newspaper nursing a can of ale
it scared me to think about a world that could kill a man like dewitt albright
what could a world like that do to me
hey easy wheres your car
easy looks up from pulling weeds
in the shop
im havin it fixed up a little
man cant get no decent job in this town without a car
i aint studyin no job
aint thinkin bout no job
how you gonna live
im gonna go to work for myself
take a little money i got saved up and go into real estate
start fixin up folks gardens again
and do a few favors on the side
favors for friends
what you talkin bout favors
well like a woman offered me thirty dollars to go track down her husband for her
you talkin about private investigatin or somethin
you could get in trouble doin that
easy keeps working
like a man once said to me odell walk out your door in the morning and youre already in trouble
its just how youre mixed up in that trouble that counts
easy gets up and turns on the water hose
if you got a friend that does bad and you still keep him as your friend even though you know what hes like
do you think thats right
all you got is your friends easy
easy starts to nod but then spots hovering over a rosebush in a neighbors yard across the street his shears ready to cut
calling out get out of that yard
to odell bastard cut down two of my trees
easy picks up a rock and sails it
odell comes off the porch and does the same
then a neighbor from across the street joins in
the woodcutter ambles off toward another block leaving easy odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the street
a man with a pony is setting up a camera
a few children have gathered and more are running over from other parts of the neighborhood
the man props up a hand painted sign cowboy pictures cents and lifts the first customer onto the pony positioning a cowboy hat on the childs head
another neighbor joins easy and company and they continue to laugh and talk looking up from time to time to wave at friends in passing cars
i thought about what odell had said about friends and it made sense to me
odell goes to church every sunday so he would know
later on he challenged me to a game of dominoes
and whatd he do that for
we got to talkin bout texas and fooled around and drunk almost a quart of whiskey
and i forgot about daphne monet dewitt albright and carter and them
and sat with my friend on my porch at my house
and we laughed a long time
