screenplay by neal marshall stevens revisions by tim day we roll credits over peal tight on a pattern of brown and black textures
the image begins to shake
we hear a low rhythmic thump thump thump
the surface slowly peels off like flecks of dried old paint as we pull back a little wider and realize that were looking at an old door
the door continues to rattle
something or someone is behind it desperately fighting to get out
wider still to include the rusted worn doorknob twisting back and forth and shaking
whatever is in there its locked inside
its almost pitch black in here as a few beams of light fight their way through holes in the torn black window shades of this flop house apartment
te take in the scene
a young woman mid twenties lies on an old mattress tossed on the floor in the center of the room
theres a man asleep next to her with his arm around her
about a half dozen others in various stages of nakedness are sprawled unconscious around the room
we boom down and as we do we were in the middle of a crack x party the night before
our young woman amy klein moving through the party
she reaches into the pocket of her long black coat and lifts out a tape recorder
she clicks it on and slips it back into her pocket
the man from our opening shot offers her some x
she lets him place it on her tongue and then she swallows it
he smiles pleased and turns to leave
she quickly but slyly removes the x from her mouth and flicks it away
the party in full gear
things are really starting to get weird here as the crack pipe starts to make its way around the room
amys putting on a full x performance taking the crack pipe and quickly passing it on pretending to be too far gone for another hit all the while studying the
other partiers with a keen reporters eye
after everyone has left
the sun is coming up
amy alone with the man
hes half naked on the mattress trying to pull amy close
amys looking for a safe exit but shes stayed too long and hes starting to get a little rough with her
a wrong move now could push him over the edge
amys vision starts to blur
did he slip her something
he pulls her onto the bed with him and starts to undress her she cant fight him off
but then his eyes roll back in his head and he passes out
amy looks around the room which is starting to swirl
she tips out of frame and we back to scene as amys eyes flutter open quickly adjusting to her unfamiliar surroundings
she freezes for a beat then after determining that the man is asleep she slides her way off the mattress and rolls quietly onto the floor
hes relieved when she finds that shes still dressed
she snatches a small tape recorder off the ground and clicks rewind satisfied
she snatches a half empty pack of smokes off the floor and shes gone
a big sign identifies this old brick building as the home of the london underground a weekly newspaper in the village voice mode only scuzzier
a pair of elevator doors open
amy klein exits and walks towards camera
shes all in black from her black sneakers and black stockings up to her tinted glasses and jet black hair
the only thing about her that isnt black is a complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight
she has a paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand and she alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a practiced proficiency
she ignores the unhappy looks of her fellow employees
she clearly has practice at this as well
little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft space
too hip employees sit at their desks typing at computers conferring at tables going about the business of turning out another issue
they point and whisper as amy walks by
amy passes another cubicle as a young reporter holds the newspapers front page up in front of amy
a big headline reads how to be a crack whore written over a photo of a crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen
beneath the headline is written a special report by amy klein
nice reporting klein
how bout you show me what you learned
amy is already past him she throws back a middle finger for a response
betty ish her glasses hanging on the tip of her nose sees amy coming
its half past four
betty gives a broad gesture over her shoulder pointing toward the editors office across the work space
amy heads across the way toward the office
betty picks up the phone
on phone mr
charles rickman the editor in chief is an englishman in his early forties sporting a pony tail which like a moustache on a sixteen year old only serves to emphasize
his true age
hes fiddling around with some sort of tv vcr set up and is looking away from the door as it opens and amy enters behind him
without turning ah i detect that unique and ubiquitous combination of female sweat and patchouli oil that signals the arrival of
he turns toward a dour amy
the delightful and world famous amy klein
have a seat angel of light
eat me charles
its exactly that lack of respect for authority that got you fired from the new york post
i wasnt fired
i was re assigned
where would you be without me
by the way i dont recall ever being thanked properly for this re assignment
charles makes air quotes with his fingers
lucky for you i opened my doors to you here as soon as i heard you were available
more air quotes
amy walks over to a trophy table where she looks over a cluster of framed photos
she points to one of her and charles smiling together
more innocent times for both
i seem to recall a rather similar reassignment with you charles
well thanks to international conglomerates and the euro dollar i along with mother england am blessed with your acquaintance yet again
hey a contracts a contract
she holds up the cassette recorder
look if all this about me being late with the crack whore story its all right here and its gold
i was just about to interrupting its not about the crack whores im sure youre working your usual unrestrained insightful magic on what im certain will be another eye opening
i expect nothing but brilliance in five thousand words or less
beat but this is better
amy spots an open container of chinese food on charless desk
she inspects it then picks something out of it with a pair of chop sticks
so what then
are we being sued again
sees her eating please feel free to have some of that
what is this
general tsos cat
spare me the nothing comes close to new york chinese speech just this once
go on sit down
just something i wanted to show you
he heads back over to the vcr
amy ditches the chinese food and picks up her coffee again
she sits lights another cigarette
he finds the button presses it and turns back to amy
somebody mailed us this thing around two weeks ago but in keeping with our usual level of efficiency betty didnt get around to opening it til this morning
then she brought it to me
what is it
charles closes the door
whats the matter
this x rated or something
amy with your encyclopedic world wide knowledge of skank ology have you ever heard of deaders
theyre generally in their forties kind of ex hippy types
they still think jerry garcia is like really cool even though hes dead
not dead heads
d e a d e r s
you know sometimes they wear ponytails
dream about how great the sixties were
you see em in the park sometimes
love of my life go screw yourself
im asking you a serious question
ive never heard of deaders
watch the tape
charles goes to the vcr and hits the play button
amy finishes her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still glowing butt of her last one
she leans forward
the image flickers into view
its handheld low rez clearly been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere decorated in a mattresses on the floor beer spray on the walls type decor
there are around half a dozen people there in their twenties and younger
they drift in and out of frame in and out of focus
we hear a womans voice clearly the person who is operating the camera as the shot moves about the room
this is marla chen
off screen okay okay
here we go
the camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on anna a girl with bright dye red hair on the side of her head that isnt shaved
anna looks with no particular expression and goes away
the camera turns toward a smudged mirror on the wall and we get a look at marla a twenty ish asian girl
heres marla chen official deader archivist
he camera turns toward a door as it opens and katya a young round faced girl with dark hair comes out looking a bit nervous
off screen and heres the star of the show
she gives a little smile
the camera swings over toward a mattress on the floor
some of the people are tugging a plastic sheet over it
one of them and the one who clearly appears to be in authority a man with albino like features and heres our deader bed this is the scene of the
crime to be
he camera moves in on winter
and here is the fearless leader of the deaders
winter glances up then dismisses the camera altogether
he looks off screen then raises his hand
the room quiets
we hear various voices
winter looks up and the camera swings toward katya
a girl next to her starts to prompt her
do you become one of us of your own free will
are you afraid
fear is the place we go to learn
reciting my skin isnt real
my eyes arent real
my muscles arent real
my bones my heart my veins and nerves and flesh and meat
what i see what i hear what i taste what i touch what i remember what i think what i feel arent real
off screen go on
im not real
the camera swings back to winter who gestures for her to come forward then swings back to see her coming
the various people in the room gather around as she comes to the mattress
the camera moves this way and that trying to get the best angle to cover the action
people spread towels on the mattress over the plastic as katya naked sits down on the towels then lays back flat on the mattress
inter looks to the black kid standing next to him
he comes up with a big handgun maybe a
im not real
the camera moves in closer as winter takes the gun and slips it into katyas hand
im not real
he slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her head
sits forward in her seat not quite believing what shes seeing
just keep watching
katya is breathing fast now but we cant be sure if its terror or passion or some combination of both
she continues to lie on the mattress the barrel of the gun pressed against the side of her head
im not real
winter reaches out hesitant and cocks the gun in her hand
meanwhile we see other hands reaching in pressing a folded up towel against the opposite side of her head
other hands come in and press a doubled over pillow against the towel
im not real
she closes her eyes grits her teeth
her back arches
drops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers
katya holds her breath
and pulls the trigger
theres a huge concussion as the bullet tears straight through her head
we can see it splatter out the other side tearing through the towel and the folded over pillow which catch a great blast of bone and brain
we hear some screams in the room
amy jumps back
have you called the police on this
i want to know if youve called the pol
i said just watch
oh man dont tell me that was some special effect
you tell me
this is sick
thats saying a lot for you
the camera is now pointing at winter
there is a look of deep tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down staring toward katya who is lying as dead as dead can be on
blood has run from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic and towels on the side of the bed catch the mess
winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from katyas lifeless hand
and then light as a feather lies down on top of her
the camera moves forward and down as marla presumably elbows her way through for a better vantage point
the camera moves in close as winter stretches out along katyas body
he places his lips on her forehead kissing her lightly then presses his lips against hers kissing her or maybe something else
it seems almost as if hes breathing into her
his body moves as his lungs expand and expel and he seems to be struggling toward some non sexual climax
amy watches both repelled and fascinated
winter continues his odd ritual finally taking a great final breath as if hes reached the point of exhaustion and expels it
he leans in close
amy leans in close as well
he draws in another breath he seems to be in agony as he does it presses his lips to katyas dead ones and exhales
the breath seems to go on forever longer than it should
and then when it seems as if winter cant breathe out another teaspoon of air katyas body abruptly twitches beneath him and then she sucks in a ragged breath
her previously open and lifeless eyes move
her head raises up
she simply stares breathing again for the first time in a moment unable to quite take in what shes seeing
winter exhausted looks down at katya smiling
theres nervous laughter sounds of relief from around the room
winter slides off of her
katya looks this way and that presumably at the others looking down at her
a hand reaches down and she takes it
the camera follows as winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing
all this despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious hole in her head
the size of a dime on one side the size of a half dollar on the other
the others move in touching her congratulating her
shes still a bit shaky uncertain
then she lifts one of her hands to the side of her head the side with the big exit wound
she touches it gingerly confirming that it is really there
then she slowly slides her fingers in
they penetrate her skull unobstructed to the second knuckle
katya takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them bloody
yet shes alive
she looks up at the others then smiles widely
the others move in giving her hugs pecks on the cheek
she touches the wound again
she starts laughing
as if actually realizing it im fine
she touches the wound again
i feel great
she starts laughing
the image cuts off goes to snow
there is a moment of silence
amy turns to charles
what the hell
thats what i said
have you found any of these
i havent done anything
i told you i just looked at it today
by some chance are you
interested in pursuing this
amy hesitates shaking her head not sure what its all about
maybe this is just some kind of bull shit shot on tape gore movie
and since thats all it can be thats all youre going find but it sure smells different to me
if its bull shit youll know pretty fast
if its not
amy though is only half listening lost in her own thoughts
how could she
who said miracles can only happen at lourdes
who said they happen there
she lifts her fingers to the side of her head duplicating the action of katya slipping her fingers inside the wound
you know what my father said once
that all writers were queers
no that was a different time
this time we were driving down the block and there was this fortune telling place you know this gypsy fortune telling place in a store front
and he said you know if i could tell the future i wouldnt be living in any crappy store front
he looks back at the tape
if i could do that i wouldnt be hanging out in some rundown basement
id own the earth
maybe theyre just getting started
what else do we have besides the tape
just a return address on the envelope
he holds up the envelope which is addressed to amy klein c o the underground
snatches the envelope out of his hand
she reads the return address
looks like your online fan base is growing
its an address in bucharest
its where all the euro trash kids looking for a good time are heading these days
amsterdam is so s
shes shocked that he would even know
i still like to keep my finger on the pulse even though i know you think i dont have one
she thinks about it
he hands her a thick envelope
your ticket hotel and per diem
you know me too well
its what keeps me up at night
beat now heres the part where im supposed to say be careful
call me when you get settled
she just smirks and exits
stock footage a train rolling through the countryside
a cab pulls up to the front of the building
amy gets out and walks up to the front door
she pulls an envelope out of her bag
its the one that the tape came in
she checks the name on the envelope marla chen
compares it to a name on the mailboxes
amy walks past the lobby and up the stairs
amy makes her way down the narrow dark hallway and finds the appropriate door
she knocks at it
she looks down and sees a lone fly crawl out from under the door
then another follows and another
she kneels down to inspect it
she leans forward and sniffs
the results are inconclusive
then she lays herself flat down on the floor presses her nose up against the bottom of the door and sniffs
the smell of dead wretched air is overwhelming
and thats when a large worn shoe steps into frame right in front of amy
irritated with appropriate accent have you lost something
amy leaps up in one quick move to find herself face to face with the manager an older man whos a little winded from his climb up here
between his teeth he clenches a half chewed three quarter smoked cigar
the smoke seeps through his yellowed teeth
yes i ah
she pats her pockets
then tries another tactic
im looking for my sister
youre not chinese
shes my half sister
i havent heard from her in two weeks so i got nervous
the manager stares at her in disbelief
knows shes up to something
amy sniffs the air coming from the room again
does it always smell like this in here
the manager blows a bloom of smoke out of his nostrils
he yanks the cigar from his mouth and sniffs
doesnt seem that bad to him
marla is a friend of mine and shes missing
my pulls a few american bills from her pocket
i need five minutes in there
then ill know what i need to know
the manager stares at the money for a beat then stares back at amy
he bites down on his cigar and snatches it out of her hand
he pulls out his ring of keys and unlocks the door
the place is dark and cold
the manager stays in the hallway he looks at amy and taps his watch
amy nods as he pulls the door closed
she descends down the dark hallway
her face tightens as she takes in the deathly ripe air
the buzzing of flies getting louder with each step
as she approaches a room she recoils clutching her face from the stench
she inhales drawing in the smell to acclimate herself and almost vomits
she steadies herself drawing in breaths through her nose tentative at first and finally in larger breaths until she can tolerate it
he looks back toward the entry door she is alone
amy steps in and stops struggling to keep herself from retching
no sign of anything dead
no sound except the sinister buzzing of flies
amy steps cautiously in
she looks toward one side sees a closet with a double sliding door
she slides open one side sees nothing that shouldnt be there a ragged winter jacket a green plastic raincoat a hangar festooned with scarfs some other garments still obscured beneath
cleaning bag plastic
she hesitates then calmly slides the other side open
more of the same
she turns in the other direction
theres a little kitchen
nothing dead there
she starts forward then turns back staring at the refrigerator
she goes quickly over and tugs it open
not so much as a ketchup bottle
curious she opens the freezer
she heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor leading to another bedroom
at the end of the hallway is a bathroom
the door to the bathroom is open and the toilet on the far wall faces the door
marla is there
dressed only in bra and panties she is sitting on the closed lid of the john leaning forward in what seems at first to be an impossible angle
her hands hang forward almost touching the floor
her head is cocked back staring up
her skin is gray swollen
amy takes a few steps forward for a better look
as she approaches she sees the reason for the odd position of the body
a long boot lace has been tied around marlas neck and tied to the wall pipe on the toilet
the flesh of her neck has swollen out almost burying the boot lace
she has hanged herself in this ghastly way
amy takes another step forward
as she does theres a sudden loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on marla abruptly rise up alarmed or whatever it is flies are at her approach
but they soon return to the corpse crawling about the face around the edges of the glazed eyes around the margins of the open mouth rimmed with dry foam around
the out thrust tongue
amy covers her mouth with her shirt trying to filter out the stench
she backs away from the body and into another room
amy starts to search fast thorough shes done this sort of thing before
she finds a journal opens it
she tosses it aside
pulls open a drawer
she tugs out what looks like a blade less knife handle
she presses a stud
a stiletto blade springs out
she tosses it back in the drawer tugs some other stuff into view
some bills some shoelaces loose change
she goes drawer to drawer looking for anything that might mean something
socks ragged underwear cheap jewelry tee shirts and short skirts and jeans
amy stops surveying the territory
where to look next
then deciding she goes to the bed
she reaches under it sliding her hand around tugs out a dust encrusted skirt
feels around some more hesitates pulls something else out
she brings it out into view
its a desiccated mouse
she grimaces and tosses it back under the bed in disgust
then slides her hand between the mattress and the box spring
she feels around then stops finding something
she pulls out a little red paper folder the kind that photographs come from
she opens it
it appears to be a photographic record of another deader party
we see some of the same participants we also see marla herself in some of the pictures
amy flips the next photograph
it shows marla next to winter
hes holding something in his hand
amy looks closer
the puzzle box amy turns another photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front of marla
the picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose on one end
marla is on the other side almost a kind of joke photo
she has a kind of sickly smile on her face
amys eyes narrow
she holds the picture closer
there seems to be a figure lost in shadows and the closer she looks the more reality merges with the grains of the photo
what is there
amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room
she stuffs the book in her satchel
amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the unseen bathroom
she sits silent waiting
then the sound of the scratching comes again
the sound of flies rising and again more distinct something scratching
she keeps her position still listening
just the slow steady untroubled buzzing
she moves toward the bathroom
and again theres the tiny scratching and the rush of sound as if something has disturbed the flies
the sound stops
the flies are still except for the occasional buzz
she advances until she can glimpse the edge of one of marlas hanging out thrust hands the tip of one finger just touching the floor
marlas long fingernails are painted green
she comes around the edge of the bathroom door
marla is motionless
she leans from the pipe by the shoelace
the shoelace is still buried in her throat
the flies buzz up again
the glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets
one of her hands is not visible from amys position
we see scratches on the floor beneath her fingernails
amy steels herself and then walks closer
on the corner of the sink theres a thick manila envelope with something bulky inside something that looks just like a cassette tape
theres a name written on it and the marker is right next to it
it reads amy amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the envelope horribly close to the body in doing so
she enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink
she is about six inches shy of grabbing it
she notices that her hip is almost touching marlas face as she leans
the flies stir
the stench rises
she stretches closer and marlas body is pushed aside a few inches
closer and closer amy reaches
her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope
she pitches it and pulls it toward her
it falls off the sink and onto the floor behind marla
now amy must kneel and reach past marla face
she holds her breath as she reaches long and far
she manages to grab the envelope but her face is almost cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse
as she pulls the envelope up she notices something else in marlas hidden hand
amy reaches over and pries open marlas hand
her blackened fingers snap as they are pulled off the box
amy grabs the box and envelope stuffs them into her bag and stands
as she stands next to marlas body suddenly amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away falling backward onto the floor as she does
she rolls over and in a half crawl half scramble gets herself back up to her feet
amy backs up against a wall kicking marla as she kicks the floor
we cant tell if marla is moving from the kicks or if she is somehow alive
either way its to much for amy
she stops moving
marlas mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid falls to the floor
its almost as if she is trying to speak
amy has seen enough
up she goes as she tears down the hall through the living room and smack into the manager
which needless to say scares the shit out of her
hes standing inside the now open door to the apartment
she hung herself in the bathroom
call the police
the manager grabs amy by the arm
he pulls the cigar from his mouth and points it in her direction
amy hears police sirens in the background
who are you
pointing his cigar at amys satchel what do you have in there
in a flash amy twists her arm out of his grasp and slings her knee up into his nuts
he doubles over
amy comes flying down the hall at top speed
she reaches the top of the stairs and starts down
and as she does her feet slip
she slides down five or six steps then over balances throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the polished stone steps
she keeps sliding down finally over balancing again flipping over and landing on her back on the landing half way between the floors
the manager looks down the stairs for her
he doesnt even attempt to chase her
he curses her in his native tongue
amy breaks through the doors of the building
she hits two of the ten stairs down to the sidewalk
people walking by hardly notice
up ahead a police car is turning down the street
she stops and walks calmly diverting her eyes
the police car races by and amy walks faster and faster then runs
close on a tray of ice being cracked apart
its contents poured into a open towel
amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch now dressed in only panties and a bra an image unpleasantly reminiscent of marla especially with the spotting of
bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin
she has a dripping ice pack in one hand which she applies to this bruise and that and a bottle of gin in the other
she doesnt look happy
she takes a drink then looks toward a tv and vcr in front of her
theres a tape half inserted into the vcr
we can see the empty envelope with amy written on it lying on the floor
he tape is within reach of amys bare foot and she lifts a toe toward it hesitant
she puts her toe against the tape
hanging on the edge of decision
finally she shoves it forward with her toe
it slides into the machine
she grabs up the remote and turns on the set
the image appears
its marla looking like she hasnt slept in days sitting on a chair in her apartment staring into camera
her eyes are glazed distant
but she looks a hell of lot better than she did in the bathroom
a little sad i knew youd come
course if youre watching this tape its already too late for me
but maybe you can stop it
amy removes the puzzle box from her satchel
stares at it
he promised us pleasures beyond anything we could ever imagine
we just had to fight through the pain first
easier said than done
beat dont open the box amy
if you do winter wins and if he wins someone pounds on a door
hurried go to pletkow station at midnight
go to the south end of the platform and step onto the last car
find a guy named joey who runs the show and tell him i sent you
hell guide you to them
the pounding gets louder
save them amy
marla leaps forward and those you trust the most trust the least
shuts off the camera
it goes black for a few seconds and then cuts to snow
amy sits staring at the snow her face empty
she sets the puzzle box on the table and stares at it
takes a sip of her drink
dont open it
it shakes amy out of her fugue
she leans over picks up the receiver
an old style phone
charles sits at his desk
he is twisting pencils in a small plastic sharpener
dont tell me i woke you up
i wont believe that
you know i dont sleep when im working
what do you want charles
you were supposed to call me
you know me i dove right in
i was gonna call you tomorrow
the thing is
i started thinking
you know thats never a good thing charles
amy looks at the puzzle box on the table
it seems to be reflecting the snow of the tv set in some strange form
she looks closer its an abstract image of a little girl screaming
she compares it to the tv set it shows only white static snow
i know the crazy stuff you do for a story
thats what i get paid for
and thats why i hired you
the thing is amy
some things you shouldnt do you know what i mean
charles finishes a pencil and blows off the shavings
look i say this to you but in my heart i know that one time its going to happen
that youre going to end up i dont know dead or god knows what
but when it does happen i dont want it to be my fault
she watches the image of the little girl fade
ill make sure it wont be
you know youre messing with my conscience here
charles i cant do the sensitive thing
i dont know how
i get the message
i knew the message before i got it
youve had a change of heart
you want me to come home
well i cant
not until i know the truth
youre off the hook
i gotta go
amy hangs up
she waits a moment hesitates then takes the puzzle box from the table
she begins to explore its edges with her fingers rolling it over and over in her hands
it starts to unlock
she jumps as it begins to change shape and sets it back on the table
light seems to emanate from within as it clicks into another form
the table beneath it seems tremble the ice in her drink taps against the edge of the glass
figure appears in the darkness behind her
here we go folks the phone rings
she nearly leaps out of the chair striking the puzzle box with her hand
the puzzle box closes
pinhead vanishes back into the shadows
charles i get the message
your my editor not my mommy
long beat charles
but theres no sound
a sound comes over the line a hoarse gurgling sound a ghastly wet sound the same sound amy heard coming from the throat of the hanged marla
through phone wet choking voice dont open
the line goes dead
she shoves the whole phone away from her
she sits breathing fast for a second staring at the box
only the sound of the snow on the tv
she stands and pulls her pants on
a thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a station
lit with cold fluorescent light amy now dressed with her sunglasses in place slides her card through the slot and shoves through the turnstile
she descends the long non working escalator the only one on it at this time of night
she reaches the subway platform
it is virtually empty
amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the middle
she scans the far end of the platform past a lone figure in a shiny green plastic raincoat who lies motionless on a bench
a couple middle aged guys in security uniforms maybe heading for some night shift somewhere stand not moving hands thrust in pockets
she turns back to the bench but the figure in the shiny green raincoat is gone
she takes up a position at the far end of the platform
a moment later a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair
a few seconds later a train comes roaring into the station
amy watches the car pass her one by one as the train slows
the train is virtually empty
one car after the next rolls by as the train slows
finally as the train moves slowly to a stop a car different from the others comes in
this one for some odd reason seems to have newspaper covering all the windows taped up from the inside
one of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly in front of the spot where amy is standing the spot marked by the stenciled puzzle box
theres a pause then the doors slide open just one the one set in front of amy
the others stay closed
the interior of the car is dark the lights apparently are not working
a tall odd looking man in a conductors uniform is standing there
he gestures toward the adjoining car
is joey on this ride
come on in
the doors slide closed
the train pulls out
the interior of the car has been transformed into some odd ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse
as the train passes out of the station and the lights dim we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes or at any rate something being smoked in
some kind of pipe glinting in the darkness
various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers and the tunnel lights come in providing a flickering constantly changing illumination
in the uncertain light amy can see the various celebrants hanging out some on the seats some on the floor some dressed some partially undressed some engaging in desultory drug
use others in desultory sex acts mostly teenagers and twenty nothings
amy looks around not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene
the conductor touches her arm
down that way
she threads her way through the tangle of people
in the flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh pierced faces pierced nipples pierced things that we cant even be sure what they are
expressions flash by in the flickering light some dull others laughing
she pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward the rear of the car
a rat feeds on the contents of a young womans purse as she and another woman are tangled in passion
there illuminated in flashes joey a thin ill shaven english guy in his mid twenties is sprawled on a seat
one of his lower eyelids has a ring in it
it flicks up every time he blinks
he reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head up and down in his lap
joey looks up and spots amy
he points an accusing finger at her but his mood is good natured
ahhhh now here comes a daring soul
a person committed to a just cause
another seeker of the truth no doubt
joey is clearly smitten with amy
i like what i see inside of you
are you joey
ive been called worse
he brushes the hair of the woman in his lap then offers amy his hand
and i have the privilege of meeting
amy looks at the woman in his lap declines a hand shake
marla chen sent me
im looking for a girl named katya
another young girl with red hair and half her head shaved
a guy with glasses named winter
joeys eyes narrow
something has clearly clicked
he laughs slightly starts shaking his head
and the plot thickens
dont tell me youre mixed up with those mother fuckers
tell me amy klein do you even know what theyre about
thats why im here
i need you to help me find them
moral quandary time here
what should he do what should he do
if he tells her the hopefully available and eminently fuckable damsel is thrown into the pit of oblivion or anyway is potentially fucked up for life
and that would be such a regrettable waste
if he refrains from telling her
she may yet be saved
a possible trophy awaits me
angel and devil on the shoulder
angel devil angel devil
oh the hell with it entropys destroying everything anyway
why shouldnt i do my part
tell me what you know about the deaders
what do you think they do
i think they bring the dead back to life
is that what you really think
who are they
where can i find winter
some people say winters some sort of fucked up guru some say hes not human and others say hes not real
but there is a place they hang out those who believe i mean
where is it
a part of him clearly doesnt want to tell
angel devil angel devil
if you dont tell me someone here will
yeah you see now thats the problem
youve got that fucked up self destructive thing going on
im already into it
angel devil angel devil amy produces the puzzle box from her pack
joey looks at it like hes just seen a ghost
this is making me very unhappy
he pushes the woman from his lap
hes more serious now
poteilari and minvara
on the northeast corner two doors down theres a stairway going down into a closed up building
its always locked and theyre not always there
i dont know where they are when theyre not
and once you get mixed up with them its like that story with the tar baby chances are you never get loose and if you do you never get clean
the conductor shouts from somewhere
hands promptly reach up covering the windows with newspaper
the conductor goes to the door
the band finishes its set as the light from the station shines through the newspapers
joey looking drab in the steady uneven light stares at amy
i cant take responsibility for you
im not asking you to
amy begins to walk off
joey leans forward for the first time he seems sincere almost foreboding
he shouts over the breaking train
amy klein im doing a change of heart thing here which doesnt usually happen with strangers but im trying to give a little back its this whole karma kick im
on dont do it
dont go any deeper
forget about it
change your name
become somebody different
the other members of the car watch the two of them
cant do that
ive got that fucked up self destructive thing going on
yes you do
the one door hisses open
amy stares at joey for a second turns and departs back into the fluorescent lit station
joey calls after her
only he can bring you back
amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut
the train pulls away
she checks her watch then moves to the other side of the platform
she looks down the tunnel
the light from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the curved wall of the tunnel
she turns back in the direction she just looked
far down the platform theres a bench with a lone occupant a slumped over figure dressed in a shiny green raincoat
she turns toward it staring
in the distance no details of face or form are visible just the lumpy figure in the shiny green raincoat
she takes a step toward it but still cannot make out any detail in the slumped over figure
as does the train
there is no sign of movement
she comes around closer to the edge of the platform to get a more direct view of the green coated form
as she does she sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench hanging limp
the hand is gray
amy takes a step forward
his eyes pop open
he looks at her with large black eyes dead eyes
dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool of fresh blood
amy gasps takes a step back and her heel lands on the edge of the subway platform
she struggles for balance
abruptly a mans voice comes from somewhere
amy stumbles forward goes down to her knees and turns
around twenty feet behind her standing on the edge of the platform with his back toward the drop is winter wearing a black trench coat cinched at the waist
he looks down the tunnel
amy does as well
the train is coming into the station
she turns back toward winter
he stares at her with malevolent eyes
and as the train comes flying in he calmly falls backward directly into its path
in an instant shes up running alongside the braking train
the doors open but virtually nobody comes out
the front of the train is still far ahead
you hit someone
someone fell in front of the train
the doors hiss and start to close
finally amy reaches the front window of the train
she hammers on it
it opens and a middle aged womans face leans out the driver
somebody fell in front of the train
where is he
whered he fall
back there way back
she looks back in the direction from which shes come
the bench is now empty
amy though is now looking this way and that at the confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of the train
there is no sign of winter the train is still there doors open
there are transit cops on the station disgruntled passengers hanging out on the platform
track workers are poking around underneath it
amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars staring at the empty bench at the place where the mysterious figure was sitting
shes looking grim
behind her a track worker approaches the driver whos standing with a pair of transit cops
hes shaking his head shrugging
the driver curses heads back toward the first car
one of the cops approaches amy
well the men have looked
and theres nothing there
you dont seem terribly surprised
theres a sudden hiss
amy turns as the train doors close
i mean you dont seem terribly surprised that there isnt somebody under the train
a i dont know what to say
i saw him
thats the thing
can you tell me again just what it is that you saw
um i was standing on the platform
the train starts to move out of the station
amy looks toward it
the train is moving on one of the center tracks so that you can look through the windows of the cars and see through them to the platform on the
i saw this man standing on the edge of the platform facing away from it
but now amy is seeing something through the windows of the moving train
on the platform on the far side there is a lone figure the man in the black trench coat
amy jumps looks more closely
did he say anyth
in an instant amy is tearing down the platform heading for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side
amy is watching staring through the moving train windows
the figures are still there
winter is staring at her hey stop
n the next instant the cop is giving chase and another cop clearly the tomislav called by the first cop further down the station is rushing in to head amy
over there over there
n the next instant tomislav tackles amy and she goes down on her face
even with the rather large cop on top of her shes still struggling
god damn it get off of me
get the hell off of me
she keeps struggling as the first cop and the others on the station converge on her
she looks toward the far platform
the figure is still there visible through the windows of the departing train
then the last car of the train passes leaving an unencumbered view of the far side
the platform is empty
no sign of winter
no sign of anybody
amy stop struggling as the cops tug her arms back handcuffing her
she hardly notices but keep staring at the empty platform across the tracks
she glances up at the cops
panting tomislav looks down at her
then circles his finger around his ear to his comrades
they all understand
amy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale
the door opens behind her
she hears a familiar voice
is this where they keep the cheaper whores
amy glances up at him without expression
christ youre lucky to have a boss like me
once again i have saved your small but relatively shapely behind
least you got to travel
what were they going to charge me with anyway
they were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation and believe me if you go in there you dont come out
but through my mastery of international negotiations i managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible
you got your stuff
slowly feeling her bruises amy gets up
charles and amy walk and talk
its pissing down rain
charles hold an umbrella for the two to share
whyd you give me this story
who else would have taken it
either theyre going to think its bull shit or theyre going to be too afraid of it
but amy klein
tell me its real amy
its real or im crazy
well either way its a good story
ive got leads
ill know in the end
you know amy dearest for the average person hunger for knowledge is like hunger
we want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite
then were satisfied and we stop
youre like a glutton
you cant help over eating
i dont see you complaining
but you see thats the point
thats why i need you
because all that stuff i dont eat
i still want
so i send you in to do the eating for me and so i get to experience it without actually suffering any mental indigestion
thats for me
nobodys forcing anything down your throat
you see amy you never grew up with all this catholic god and guilt stuff
it doesnt mean anything to you
i worry about god and heaven and hell
not during the day you understand but around three in the morning it keeps me up
i want to know whats coming
whats up in heaven and down in hell or even if theres nothing
its useful when youre making plans
so go find out and well tell the world
you know charles theres something vaguely demonic about you
did you know the word demon comes from the greek word for knowledge
as in demonstrate
no i didnt know that
charles shakes his head disgusted
theyre in front of amys hotel now
charles flags down a then back to your room lie down in your coffin until the hours of daylight have passed as is your wont then go get me my
a you dont have to worry
i never do
im not here to save people and im not here to judge them
i just take em as they come
and use them as they pass by
ill be at the soffitel
charles hops in the cab and drives off as amy walks up the steps to the hotel lobby
amy watches him go waves then spins back towards the curb
she flags down a cab and hops in
a ragged run down place looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day
we see the street sign identifying the place poteilari and minvara
a cab pulls up and amy gets out
she crosses the street passes one side door and then comes to a building thats been sealed up doors and windows cemented shut with cinder blocks
beyond a narrow railing is a stairway pressed up sideways against the building running down to a basement entrance
amy looks down the stairway to its narrow bottom
the stairs and the bottom are littered with trash
a filthy mattress lies at the very bottom
amy heads down
at the bottom of the stairs theres a wooden door
a hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp thats been bolted to the door frame
some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door long rendered unreadable by the effects of time
amy inspects the padlock
its heavy and uncompromising
she tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain but thats only a few inches
amy peers into the darkness beyond but cant see a thing
she looks down at the mattress that shes standing on steps to the side and shoves it up
then as if the light breaks she reaches out grabs the hasp and pulls
the bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose
they slide out with it
she tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open
there is a narrow corridor beyond all in gloom
amy steps in her way illuminated only by the indefinite light that leaks in from the street
theres an archway presumably leading into the rest of the basement on one side but its blocked by a great heap of rubble
amy ponders the chances of getting through it and decides to check out the rest of the hallway
she works her way through a series of ominous corridors
amy senses that she is not alone stops and turns around
there is only a single door left at the far end of the hallway
it hangs half open but we cannot see whats inside
she approaches it reaches out and pushes the door open
its a bathroom
as she enters we see a figure beyond her in the hallways buried in the shadows
this is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into an available corner basically a toilet and a sink so close that theres hardly room to move
a mop and some other supplies long forgotten are propped up in a corner
amy steps in looks down the toilet
nothing left but some nasty stains the water long dried up
her face brushes against something hanging in the air
she pulls back
its a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb
she tugs on it
no power here
she stands in the dark claustrophobic place puzzled
she looks back down the hall
it seems as if shes come to another dead end
then she stares at the bathroom door
open now it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall the only place she hasnt looked
amy steps back virtually straddling the toilet and pushes the door closed
as she does of course what little light there is vanishes completely
if theres something behind the door she cant see it or anything else
abruptly theres a sharp click as she lights her lighter and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom and the previously unseen space behind the door
the walls do not meet there
there is a narrow gap leading to a passage apparently between the walls perhaps ten inches wide
hesitating only a moment amy turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot
she holds the lighter up ahead of her but its dim flickering light does not reach to the end of the passage
she moves forward cautiously the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster rotting insulation seventy five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of the walls
as she disappears into the tunnel the door slowly opens behind her
passing across the rusty doorknob a menacing blade appears
inside the tunnel amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the wall only a few inches thick but it reduces the available room to under eight inches
meanwhile the lighter in her hand is getting hot
she lets it click off
in some dim half light we can see her slipping a handkerchief carefully around it for insulation
she flicks the flint
the lighter lights
and abruptly around a million roaches which had returned from their hiding places in the absence of the light go skittering every which way
amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant
she looks at the pipe again and then starts to squeeze past it
its a tight fit
she has to squirm to get through
welcome to club anorexia
she pops free and comes out the other side
she holds up the lighter
still the light cannot reach to the end of the passage
steeling herself she moves on
but as she does the space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower
from ten inches to nine to eight until both sides of her body are scraping against the walls
she holds the lighter out
the wall continues to narrow
at the end of her outstretched arm the walls are only around five inches apart
clearly shes reached the end of the line
annoyed she starts to back out then realizes that the light on the far side of her body renders the area into which shes now moving essentially black as midnight
she brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body but she cant bring her hands together in front of her the space is too narrow
finally she reaches her hand up over her head passing the lighter from one hand to the other directly over her head
as she does the lighter almost slips
she grabs for it but it goes out
again she is lost in virtual darkness
she strikes the flint
it flickers but doesnt light
as she strikes it again it lights something in there with her
amy doesnt see it we do
the light returns now illuminating the other side of her body the way from which shes come
but because the space is so narrow she cant turn her head towards the entrance
once again the roaches go skittering away
and amy starts heading back from where she entered
her head facing away from her progress backward trying to squeeze through
she holds up the lighter it lights the area ahead which she cannot see
the flickering fire exposes the figure awaiting her
the walls on this side now also seem to narrow
the space revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist and there is only darkness beyond
darkness and the figure with the knife
amy senses something is wrong
she continues but now she can barely move a few feet before the wall becomes too narrow to pass
she pushes trying to shove through the narrow gap
but she cannot move
the walls have literally closed in until she is now squeezed between them
panic sets in
gasping amy pushes against the wall shes facing
trying desperately to turn her head around
she forces with all her might to turn her head her facial features stretching almost comically
she finally gets it around
she is face to face with the knife as it comes ripping through frame narrowly missing her arm
amy screams and drops the lighter
now in darkness she scurries frantically away back deeper into the space
amy starts struggling panic growing on her trying to climb to crouch to tug free in some direction but her movement is very limited
the walls seem to close in on her
she is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls
the figure keeps advancing towards her
shes flailing her arms now frantic
the knife wielding figure struggles having difficulty as well
one of amys hands flies back and hits the wall behind her
now she really panics her hands desperately scraping along the wall looking for anyway out
there isnt any
she looks back toward her attacker whos now right on top of her and raising the knife for one final blow
amy braces for the blades impact as she pushes against the wall when suddenly she falls backward onto the floor
her heart pounding
her breathing heavy
she checks her arms for wounds
there arent any
she looks up
the figure is gone
she stands confused and finds herself in an empty room
some discarded junk a pile of loose plaster
she leaps forward and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the hell away from the entry
odd thing is
here is no entry
she whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply exhaling
she looks this way and that but cant see the source of the sound
a pale light is visible coming from around a far corner
someone steps into the light
a young black kid
he holds a finger up to his lips
he signals her to follow him
amy moves cautiously forward
the walls have been partially torn down
the light comes from an adjoining room
amy approaches cautiously remaining in the shadows and leans forward staring through a gap in the wall into the room beyond
the various participants some of whom we recognize from the videotape movie are standing crowded around something on the floor
amy cant see just what it is that theyre staring at at first but she does see that one of the ones gathered there is katya complete with the hole
in her head
she nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the blood
the sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place
then somebody in the circle moves to get a better vantage point and now amy can see clearly what is going on
winter is lying on top of the corpse of a young man breathing into his mouth as he did with katya
an almost sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape
he takes a final deep breath
and then as before the young man gasps
winter pulls away
as he does we can see the young mans face smiling despite the knife that is lodged into his chest
winters grabs the knife and yanks it out
the others come forward helping him up
winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body
he promptly looks straight at amy still hidden in the shadows
i have a room of my own
kindly join me
he throws the knife at the wall where it embeds itself in way further then it should have and walks away
amy moves away from the opening
she circles around through a doorway and into the space that she was previously watching
she moves forward hesitantly trying to avoid the touch of the various occupants who dont behave aggressively but clearly press forward into her personal space
she looks this way and that trying to find where winter has gone
a hand comes down on her shoulder
she turns suddenly
its the black kid
winters through there
he points toward a doorway lost in shadow
amy notices on his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed
she looks down to the other hand which the kid politely offers for her to examine
amy backs away through the crowd
following her is the recently revived young man whos still completely naked
he smiles at amy
she moves away and through the door to winters room
this is a small dark space light coming mostly from a rather conventional looking standing lamp
in the shadows beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half open doors walls and shadows half lit rooms with un guessable occupants
winter is there sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee table reading a book
amy steps inside
winter doesnt react to her presence
abruptly the door closes behind her
she hesitates and walks forward
you know me
i chose you
amy pauses unsure then moves forward and takes a seat opposite him
that was a hell of a way in
makes me think that you dont want
people come in here the way they want
if it was difficult then that was the way you wanted it
a little danger
a little mystery
thats what you expected
thats what you found
winters puts the book down
his attention is now on amy
were you afraid amy
and during your little rite of passage through the walls
was it real
winter smiles he displays amusement to amys suspicions
and were you afraid when you saw marla chen
of what you found in the bathroom
you took something from her
winter studies amy
do you have it with you
amy opens her bag and produces the puzzle box
she lays on the table between them
what is it
my great grandfather created that box
he left it as a
a way to cheat death an entrance to everlasting pleasures and it belongs to me
though there are others who would disagree
marla warned me about it about you
should i be honored or afraid that you are here amy klein
do you really think you can just go along with us for a little ride and then get off when it suits you
like your new friends on the train
youre not going to find it so easy to get off this train
so i shouldnt get on
your already on it
dont dance with me amy klein
dont think for a second that you arent in danger
you are in more danger than ever imagined possible
what the hell does that mean
winter leans into amys space
listen to me
there are things that are true in the light of day
there are other things that are no less true that live in the shadows
when you shine a light on them they disappear
they stop being true
thats because it is the uncertainty of the dark that makes them possible
if the dark is deep enough
anything might be happening in it
anything at all
im one of those things
what happened to marla chen
what did you do to her
he stands and walks away from amy
why i accepted her thats all
thats all ive ever done for the people who come to me
she didnt want to become one of you whatever the hell you are
thats why she killed herself
oh but she did
and what makes you so sure shes dead
winters studies amy face
we all die over and over and over again
marla cant commit suicide
all she can do is stop believing that shes alive
and she cant even do that
winter contd the more she doubts the deader she becomes
but shell never really die because shes not really alive
that doesnt mean anything
what i saw in that room was real
what i smelled was real
real like this table
she raps on the table with her middle finger palm up
she then lifts her hand up keeping her middle finger towards winter
real like like this hand
in a flash almost supernaturally winter passes seemingly through the chair and is front of amy her hand held tightly by his
he reaches up with his other hand and uncurls amys fingers
you say this is real
he begins to move his fingers over her hand enumerating the various parts
the dorsal fascia
transverse carpal ligament across here
the process is taking on an oddly seductive quality
the median nerve underneath it
down here the carpal bones
and do you think that all those parts are what makes a hand
ill show you what makes a hand
he begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between her fingers
amy is frozen still
close on a door being unlocked
we recognize it from the opening montage
slowly it is pulled open to reveal a little girl standing there frightened
that what makes a hand
you get it by taking things away
you amy klein are the infinitesimal speck thats left when we subtract the infinite possibilities that the space you occupy might have held
the little girl kicking and screaming
she is pulled out of the closet
we never get a clear view of the man but we know he is pure evil
close on amys hand trembling in winters grip
referring to her hand this thing here isnt a presence
its an absence
its a place where things are missing
in all essential qualities it is less than nothing
in all essential qualities we are less than nothing
not solid not here not real
amy finds herself responding falling under his spell
flashback the little girl is picked up under the mans arm and pulled away
his groping hands move seductively and violently
she is carried away out of sight kicking and screaming
amy awakens from the trance
she is lying down surrounded by the deaders
winters stands above her
what did you see
what are you afraid of amy
im not afraid of you
yes you are but still you cant run you wont run
studies her i wonder why that is
beat im no devil
im no monster
amy ill never hurt you and ill never leave you
amy doesnt answer
winter extends to her a knife
winter contd accept my gift
no more fear
no more questions
no one can ever hurt you again
for a moment she appears to consider his offering
then as if waking up
she shoves herself back away from winter
but now the dead are there surrounding her reaching out for her
they begin to chant
winter takes the puzzle box and places on a makeshift altar at the head of the mattress
reciting my skin isnt real
my eyes arent real
my muscles arent real
my bones my heart my veins and nerves and flesh and meat
arent real lie down amy
itll only hurt for a second
what i see what i hear what i taste what i touch what i remember what i think what i feel arent real
no more pain
the deaders start to grab onto her
she starts to panic a little
amy contd no
she fights her way from the group and
amy smashes through a vertical plane of safety glass smashing it into a thousand tiny fragments as she goes crashing back through it
her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding down in the dark her hand scrambling for something to hold onto
her reaching hand grabs some metal handle
and abruptly water begins to cascade down onto her face
she turns herself sideways and rolls over gasping
shes in a bathtub
in fact shes just been thrown through the safety glass door
she scrambles over the bottom edge of the sliding glass door scraping herself across the tiny pegs of glass that still line the border of the frame
she pulls herself up her hand feeling for a light switch
finally she finds it flips the switch
shes in the hotel bathroom slumped over against the sink
soaking wet scratched shaking gasping she stares at herself in the mirror
theres a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder
she tugs it loose
it clinks as she drops it into the sink
its not real
its not real
she lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face
she turns toward the bathtub
she reaches through the shattered door and turns off the shower
the phone rings
she snatches it out of its cradle
through phone amy its charles i know its not too late
you just cant go too long without hearing my voice
look amy ive been thinking about the story about what happened maybe this isnt for you
amy grabs the puzzle box off the table
she spins it in her hands
charles you know i value your opinion she said with condescension but if there was ever a story i was born to write this is it
i think its too dangerous for a lot of reasons
this isnt like you
im going to hate myself in the morning
im just a little
fucked in the head
its just a funk but im fine
all i need is some sleep
i just thought id put it out there to see if youd bite
i shouldve known better
it goes against my instincts
thats what i love about you
ill call you tomorrow
beat hey charles did you know that the word demon comes from the greek word for knowledge
yes i believe ive heard that somewhere before
well i wish somebody had told me about it
she hangs up and shuts off a light on her way to bed
close on the little girl slung under the mans arm as he carried her down the hall
shes scraping at the walls the door jams anything to try to free herself from him
her hand sweeps across a small table at the end of the hall smashing over a glass vase
the room is dark drained of all color the way things appear when we see in them in almost total darkness
amys lying in bed on her stomach
the sheet has crumpled off of her
shes dressed only in her panties
abruptly theres the sound of a wettish thud and amy seems to bounce a little
her eyes open but she isnt alarmed
still lying on her back she flicks her eyes this way and that but seeing nothing she closes them again
a few seconds later we see some black liquid trickle across her shoulder coming from the unseen center of her back
it follows a course down her backbone then swerves and finds a path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades finally trickling down her neck
it continues to flow staining the pillow by her face
she stirs slightly clearly feeling the trickle
she puts her hand to her shoulder smearing the black liquid
still half asleep she tries to brush it off
but it continues to flow
finally her eyes open
she sits up painfully and looks at her hands stained with this sticky black stuff
she stares at it not quite awake enough to figure it out
she reaches over her shoulder pulls her hand back stained with the black stuff
she looks down at her pillow also stained
confused she rises painfully awkward and heads toward the bathroom
we can see that her feet leave blackish wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the bathroom
she moves in stares in the mirror sees the side of her face and her shoulder smeared with black
she fumbles for the light flips it on
in the sudden shocking glare of returning light color abruptly re enters the world
and the black of the liquid thats stained amys face and hands that track the floor of the white tiled bathroom that smear the wall where she flipped on the
light switch turns instantly to its true color the color of blood
amy gasps at the sight she looks like shes just crawled out of a slaughterhouse
she reaches behind her feeling her back trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be pouring out of her dripping to the floor pouring down the
small of her back staining the back of her panties a vivid ghastly red
in a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full blast washes away the blood from her hands scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of
the water drips to the floor commingling with the blood turning it a nasty pink
she reaches behind her back feeling again her hand comes back as vividly red as before
again she washes them
she stops dead seeing something in the mirror
something is glinting between her breasts
she touches her finger to it
it looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal poking out from inside of her almost like a tiny steel splinter
it appears to have just barely broken through the skin from inside barely a drop of blood
she stands staring down at it breathing fast
what the hell is it
then slowly almost against her will she turns her back to the mirror and looks over her shoulder
she sees and we see for the first time the center of her back where her questing hands couldnt reach
there is a knife there literally thrust through the middle of her back
the gleaming splinter between her breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her and clearly transfixed the center of her chest her heart
she strains her hands back trying to reach this impossible thing but her grasping fingers cant touch it
she turns back toward the mirror staring into her own eyes
its not real
its not real
she clenches her eyes
her fingers feel desperately for the metal tip between her breasts
its still there
she starts slapping her hands against the side of her face not gently hard slaps
but she isnt waking up
she grabs her hair pulls hard
shes still there
the knife is still stuck impossibly in her back
she sits on the closed seat of the toilet
not knowing what to do
she reaches again for the knife but she cant touch it
she buries her face in her bloody hands
im dreaming im dreaming
screams she stands turns this way and that not knowing what to do
she looks around her bathroom searching for something
she tugs open the medicine cabinet searches beneath the sink tugging the various stuff out
whatever it is that shes looking for she cant find it
she spins back to the mirror
slips back against it wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine cabinet
holding one hand against the mirror she starts to push away wincing in pain
we can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish from view drawn back inside her body
slowly making a wet sticky sound the long thin knife begins to slide out
with a gasp she heaves out
and the knife goes flying
it bounces on the floor splattering blood
with shaking hands amy bends over and picks it up
she stands staring at it
its some kind of nasty stiletto
amy stands staring at it
amy searching marlas drawers tugging one open pressing the stud on a stiletto
on this stiletto
she looks down toward the floor
she is literally standing in a pool of her own blood
she gasps turns back toward the mirror
blood is pouring from the wound
gasping almost crying amy stumbles back into the main room
with shaky hands she picks up the phone then realizes that shes still holding the stiletto in her hand
she drops it on the table
her bloody fingers press in the numbers emergency
she waits standing in the middle of her dark hotel room shaking bloody
she can hear the phone ring and ring
finally theres a click as the line picks up
but theres no voice on the other end
is there anyb
then she stops dead
there is somebody there and making a sound weve heard before
the nasty gurgling that amy heard when she tried calling marlas room
through phone only he can bring you back
she slams the phone down tears the cord from the wall
as she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking
she turns at the sound
pinhead is standing across the room from her reading from one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner
reading to all of us there comes the closing of the doors the entrances the exits so that one may pass no more out or in
he closes the book turns toward her
i like your taste in books
came with the room
along with the uncomfortable couch
amy puts the phone back on the table
who are you
why did you do this to me
believe me when i want to hurt you it will be more than a scratch
then why the hell are you here
why are you in my room
this isnt your room
this is my room my building my street
you still cant believe that youre in the real world can you
youve just had a a knife run through you
shouldnt it hurt
its a dream
dreams come to an end
nightmares are forever
he approaches her
she backs away
youve been recruited as a soldier in another mans war
a war he will never win that i can assure you
i dont know what youre talking about
but one shouldnt worship false gods
especially when that false god is themselves
im not a believer
oh you will
tell me do you believe in hell
looks down at the blade jutting out from her chest
you opened a door
he pulled you in
but the only way out is through me
he steps towards her
she grabs up the phone flings it
it hits the far wall and falls to the floor
she reaches a hand behind her to her back brings it back red with blood
we see amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder
hands trembling she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that shes unwound from a roll and laid down on the table sticky side up
she presses the towel down so that it sticks then picks up the tape with towel attached
she slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound and then tugs the tape tight across her chest compressing the towel against the wound
she takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away
she yanks yesterdays clothes up discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans
she tugs them up over her bloody legs pulls a black shirt on over her top thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on
a black leather jacket
she goes to the mirror turns trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back
she turns about to leave
then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood
she hurries to the sink rinses them off and rinses the blood off of her face and neck then grabs her bag and heads out the door
amy comes unsteadily down out of her hotel
more shadows than light
she comes around a corner and onto a narrow street moving fast her feet making loud echoey clip clops on the street
theres a bum dressed in rags leaning up against the wall of a building
as she approaches him he stirs slightly
then she looks more closely
the man is eating something very crunchy
he stares at her blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them one by one
he offers her one and smiles
amy leaps back turns and runs
some distance down the street there seems to be a flicker of light a trace of noise
she scrambles toward it
its coming up from a subway grate
she throws herself down on it
down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing below
indirect flickering light shines up from below
she looks up
theres a subway entrance
she hurries toward it
amy comes down the stairs
no sign of life
the fluorescent lights flicker some dead
amy fumbles for her metro card
this is one of those unattended entrances with entry through the top to bottom turnstiles
she starts through the turnstile
then with a squeak it sticks and she finds herself stuck half way through unable to move forward or backward
she tries to back out but the thing wont turn in that direction
she heaves forward
it finally gives way
she looks this way and that back through the turnstile she sees her bloody footprints leading all the way through
amy hears footsteps echoing towards her
through a large mirror at an intersection she sees the source of the footsteps
a cop on the beat
amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own blood
the footsteps get louder
she sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand
she grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the blood
it soaks threw in no time
the cop is nearing the corner
she grabs another then another and throws them down
the pool of her blood leaks from under them all
the cop rounds the corner he has a baton he taps against his leg
amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over
with a loud smash it spills the newspaper everywhere
as the cop walks in front of amy the blood is hidden beneath the pile of newspapers
amy bends down to attend to the mess
she makes eyes with the cop and shrugs her shoulders at her mistake
the cop smiles and nods and keeps on walking
the sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors
amy collects herself with a few deep breaths and moves on towards the platform
amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the station at hyper speed then stops instantly in front of her
the doors hiss open and amy is greeted by the tall odd looking conductor
she pushes past him
the train lurches forward as amy makes her way through the usual crowd of celebrants
she finds joey sitting court in the middle of the train car
hes wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses
his face seems sickly pale in the flashing light
he moves abruptly a slight turn of the head toward her
well look whos back
please help me
help you with what
amy hesitates an instant then tugs open her shirt revealing the gaffers tape that holds the rolled up towel to her back
she works at it
finally it tears
she tears it straight down the front of her chest as joey watches passive
her chest is stained with blood
she licks her fingers and wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest
joeys eyes narrow
he leans forward to study it
he leans in closer hesitates then leans back looking amy in the eye
wow are those real
amy doesnt react
okay youre not in the mood for my light hearted banter
what the hell this isnt my idea of paradise either
i dont understand
why arent i dead
or am i
life death theyre not all that different really
you can find your death in your life
you can find your life in your death
round and round and round you go
please help me
i am helping you
then explain what the hell is going on
why did i have a knife buried in my back
why am i seeing dead people walking around
why is there a guy with pins in his head stopping by in the middle of the night for a chat
she gets in his face
why am i not dead
theres a jolt as the train starts to pull into the station
the light from the station begins to illuminate the inside of the car more clearly
joey leans back from her
its time to give in amy youre just fighting it too hard
forget about the truth forget about reality just sit back and enjoy the ride
theres nothing you can do anyway
were all just pieces in winters little puzzle
youre willing to do anything to find the truth
joey contd thats what i find most attractive about you
well that and the fact that you have a great ass
you and i are the same really were both willing to take it as far as it will go to the edge to the extreme
beat you know what our biggest problem is amy klein
neither of us know when to get off the god damn train
the train jerks to a stop tossing amy a little
she regains her footage and turns back to joey but in the flickering fluorescent light joeys skin suddenly looks sickly pale
he doesnt answer
he doesnt move
joey come on
lets get off the train
right now you and me
he still doesnt move
amy reaches out a shaky hand and takes his glasses off
voice trailing off you and me
joeys eyes are empty glazed
not only is he dead its clear that hes been dead for awhile
then she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely dropped out around her
all she can hear is her heart beating
she slowly turns around to find that all of joeys celebrants on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar buzz of flies
some of the dead are hung from the hand rails by hooks and chains their throats slashed eyes gouged bullet holes in the head etc
a large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords
he makes a sound at amy and his chords vibrate
but theres this one coke head guy who was snorting a line when amy got on the train
he looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand held mirror
she studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her and we get a good look at his face
the entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril
looks like the partys over
suddenly all she can her is the loud roar of the train
amy stumbles back turns to run into the next train car and smacks right into marla chen
a horribly decaying marla chen
at first amy is confused but then something clicks behind her eyes as she shoves marla back down the train car
screams why did you do this to me
the trains screeches into the station and the doors hiss we have to go
i didnt have any other choice
amy looks down at her shirt as blood begins to soak through it
whats happening to me
beat like me
marla grabs her hand and starts to pull her along
weve got to go
thats for you to decide
amy looks around the platform as if deciding what to do
theres a little panic in marlas voice
you see thats the problem right there
im supposed to help you
like winter helped me
but i dont know if i can
then why are you here
because i have no other choice
no turning back now re how she looks know what i mean
no i dont
i dont know one god damn thing anymore
beat i just want to go home
marla gives her a comforting smile
then lets go home
they jump down to an abandoned track and head into the darkness
a strange twisting tunnel with eerie blue lights
pipes running along the ceiling dripping water and hissing steam
amy and marla march quickly towards camera
what happened to you
i put my head through a noose and i jumped ten feet down
they cut me down and winter breathed into me and i was alive
and everybody was happy
and like congratulating me
marlas eyes are wet with yellowish tears
and for a while it was great
but its like being a tightrope walker
youre walking along on this rope and then all of a sudden its like you realize im walking on a rope a hundred feet up in the air
and thats when you fall
struggles to control herself i tried to end it
thats when you found me
why are you doing this
why am i here
for the reward from it all
the tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns
they stop and marla turns amy in her direction
the place starts to tremble a train is approaching from far off
but it isnt enough for somebody else to stick a knife into you
you have to come to the point where you can do it to yourself thats the acceptance
the final preparation before you give your soul to it
what it is all for
thats the missing link
that part he keeps to himself
but he promises an eternal paradise filled with the ultimate pleasures
we just cant be afraid
and we cant have any doubts
introspective guess i screwed up on that part
the tunnel is narrowing the train is right around the bend
amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train
fear is where you go to learn
amy spins back to her
i told you theres no turning back amy
only he can bring you back
amys attention is on the train it roars in at full throttle
amy turns around just as the train is about to run through them to find winter arms open for her
screaming over the train all roads lead home
amys eyes abruptly pop open
shes lying on a white pillow with white sheets tucked up over her
she turns her eyes to one side
theres a hospital curtain the kind on a railing pulled closed around her
she looks down
shes lying in a hospital bed
she tries to move but she realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large leather straps
charles is there in a chair watching her
he takes a sip of coffee
she struggles with the straps
amy dont fight it its only going to make things worse
her eyes dart around the room in a panic
what the hell happened
i didnt hear from you
i went over to your hotel
you were lying on the floor
covered in every kind of stuff that can come out of a human body
amy looks down at her gown expecting a large red stain but theres no blood
every other kind
i mean i didnt
you were sort of
having a psychotic episode sweets
major mental blow out
and frankly its about time
jesus you were tied down for a day and half
off her look listen im trying to get you out of here back to london but with the damage to your hotel room
theyre not going to be so quick to let you go
amy takes a look around the psych ward
patients walking aimlessly mumbling to themselves arguing with unseen opponents rocking back and forth in catatonic states
look amy you probably wont have to stay
amy feels a sudden rush of relief
a little nervous laughter
hey charles charles
this is the best news ive had in a long time
well there you go
a whole new definition of optimism
what about marla chen
they found her dead in her room
she hung herself
they found her
you mean the police
shed been there awhile
probably did it right after she sent us the tape
where is she
jesus i dont know
does it matter
no i guess not
but this is a good story too
call it my psychotic episode or wait maybe psychotic episode one
or psychotic pilot episode
you know some play on words with episode
looks around look theres a lot of raw material around here
emphasis on the word raw
maybe theyll let you use a felt tip pen or something to take notes
somebody pulls the curtain aside
its an orderly
his name tag identifies him as m
this guys a little out there like maybe hes been dipping into the medicine cabinet a little too much
his eyes nervously scan the room like somebodys watching him
well look whos back
how we feelin
she motions to the straps
theyre for your own protection
the way you were flailing around when they brought you in somebody was bound to get hurt
he chuckles to himself get it
bound to get hurt
amy doesnt laugh
doesnt even crack a smile
dont quit your day job
to kircher whats say we lose the charm bracelets for now
turns to amy unless of course you somehow find all of this stimulating
dont drag me into your fantasies charles
to kircher please
kircher obliges and scribbles something on a folder at the end of the bed
charles leans over gives her a little peck on the cheek
as he does he whispers to her
whispering ill see about getting a camera in here
he stands winks at her
beat when you get a chance check out the public area
its a swinging place
i mean like theyre literally
he heads out
amy watches him go
she waits a beat and then hops out of bed
she looks around for nurses and orderlies but theres no one around
she exits frame
blank walls lit with flickering fluorescent lighting
theres a tv hanging from ceiling in the corner showing time lapse photography of a blooming rose a little homage to the original hellraiser
we move to find a various assortment of patients but none of them are watching the tv theyre too busy entertaining themselves and their invisible friends
amy enters cautiously feeling a little threatened by the other patients
she looks around not sure where she should plant herself and then she sees her a little girl age sitting off by herself in the corner of the room drawing
a few of them a half human half monster clawing at a closet door a child screaming a child running from the monster a child holding a butcher knife etc
are taped on the wall behind her
amy walks over to her
theres just something about her
mind if i join you
im drawing pictures
i can see that theyre lovely
want me to draw your picture
id like that very much
the little girl stares at amy and focuses in on her features
we cant see what shes drawing as her little hand starts to move across the sketch pad
but theres something a little off
her hand doesnt move like a six year old would draw it moves with the confidence and control of an adults
amy tries to get a glance at the portrait
the little girl pulls it close to her
im sorry youre right
with a few more strokes the drawing is complete
the little girl studies it pleased with herself
she spins it so amy but not the audience can see it
close on amy her eyes wide with terror
what do you think
amys pov as we get our first good look at it
its amys face as a cenobite twisted and stretched in a way that begins to reveal the skull around her dark empty eyes
theres also that nasty knife wound in the center of her chest with hooks stretching the skin back and to the side
i only draw what i see
amy backs away from her trembling
how do you know my name
the little girl giggles
amy turns to the other drawings that the little girl has taped to the walls
hey too now all look like cenobites some look like deaders one looks just like winter
this isnt happening
amy gets up to run but then she freezes when she sees marla sitting on the opposite side of the room
but heres the thing
she looks fine
amy walks over hesitant confused
marla doesnt seem to recognize her
you say that like its a good thing
marla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans in close unable to keep up her charade
whispers you know hes watching us
this is where he sends all the trouble makers
tries to show us whos boss
tries to make us believe
so it is real
as real as you want it to be
we all have our own version of the truth some are just more screwed up than others
but you wouldnt know that because you still dont know the truth
i dont understand
you see thats the point
all this deaders cenobites whatever you want to call it its all about solving the puzzle
part of that puzzle is you
finding the secrets that are hidden within you
marla pokes a finger at amys heart
right on her wound
and as soon as you find that as soon as you face it youll be free
once and for all
he pulls back into her chair
me im still looking
but what is it all for
ultimate pleasure more than anyone even those who have solved the puzzle before us have ever known
conditions of the nerve endings the likes of which your imagination could not hope to evoke
marla stares at amy deeply
the breaks into a smile
at least thats what they say
marla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her and then she takes amys hand and leans in close
problem is winter cant solve the puzzle
only a few chosen ones with just the right amount of depravity and loneliness in their soul can
beat so hes been on this quest for years searching for that mythical person who is both willing to join us and can also solve the puzzle
and it would seem amy klein that that person is me
shes trying to give amy a clue without tipping off anyone who might be watching her
he has to be there for you amy
and he will be
like he was for all of us
thats the key
without him you cant come back
its you he wants
its you he needs
remember that above all
marla looks down at amys chest
amy follows her stare to find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown
amys eyes begin to glaze over
looks like youre running out of time
amy leaps up from the table and suddenly marla is gone
in fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet
a pool of blood lies beneath her seat
she staggers a bit as she moves forward
the main corridor
it seems to go on forever
amy turns back to the common area
the she hears the familiar sound of a little girl screaming
its faint and echoing
amy turns back down the corridor to the little girls voice
its all about finding the truth
amy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold corridor
with each step she takes the walls of the corridor become whiter slowly bleaching out
she looks below her and sees the blood now draining from the wound
she stumbles back slowly and turns as the little girls screams continue
then she hears the banging and rattling of a door
like someones fighting to get out
amys father half walking half stumbling out of one of the rooms at the far end of the corridor
hes dressed in a stained white tank top shirt his eyes glazed and distant
hes knows the source of the noise and hes pissed
back to scene
amy keeps stumbling down the corridor
now amy is within the flashback
she looks good no blood almost peaceful
her father looks down the corridor toward amy but doesnt seem to see her
he turns and storms off in the opposite direction
amy cant believe what shes seeing but she cant help herself
she follows him
back to scene
amy is stumbling more than walking as she grows weaker with every step
her eyes begin to glaze over and her vision is beginning to blur
she looks down to find the trail of bright red blood trailing behind her on the otherwise pure white floor
when she looks back up she finds herself in the hallway from amys childhood home
her father is now only a few steps in front of amy as he reaches the door to his office
he turns into it and we follow amy as she steps into the office behind him to find the closet door rattling at the far side of the room
the little girl who we now realize is a young amy is screaming on the other side
we now know this door
her father marches toward it his rage building
back to scene
amy screams out to him
leave her alone
his hand tightens around the knob
he opens the door raising his free hand ready to strike a powerful blow
young amy stands there quietly with the sweetest smile on her face
then he sees the knife
the butcher knife in young amys but its over in a blink as she quickly buries it deep in his chest
he stumbles back from the closet in slow motion as amy screams
she reacts to the violence
her vision is blurring and fading fast as her life rushes out of her
she turns back to her father and everything is in slow motion as we her father stumbling back
amy losing consciousness
her father falling backwards
the knife buried up to the handle in his chest
amy hitting her knees and wobbling there for a beat trying to hold on
her fathers head falling backward
amys head falling backward onto the floor
young amy stands there and stares without emotion we hold tight on amys face from above as her eyes flutter closed
and then young amy all alone in the world
stands there over the body
we see for the first time a smile from the young girl
amys eyes snap open as we quickly boom up to find her lying on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by the deaders
shes in the middle of the ritual
the deaders are all chanting
marla and joey are there
my skin isnt real
my eyes arent real
my muscles arent real
deaders contd my bones my heart my veins and nerves and flesh and meat
what i see what i hear what i taste what i touch what i remember what i think what i feel arent real
with a glance she can see that the puzzle box in its solved configuration sits on a make shift altar at the head of the mattress
winter is towering over her at her feet
he holds out a knife the familiar stiletto for her to take
youve gone through this before amy
go through it again with me
amy has a sudden look of resignation mixed with a little relief
she reaches out and slowly takes the knife from winter
i knew you were the one
the second i saw you i knew you were the one
the chanting continues
my skin isnt real
my eyes arent real
my muscles arent real
my bones my heart my veins and nerves and flesh and meat
what i see what i hear what i taste what i touch what i remember what i think what i feel isnt real
amy looks at marla
she looks deader then ever
she chants with the others
winter holds the knife closer for amy
amy looks at the puzzle box
rays of light start to stretch out like hands and swirl from the puzzle box
a black void starts to take shape and swirl behind them
winter is pleased
i knew it
he kneels down next to amy
say it with us amy
you have to say it with us
amys hands start to tremble
yes you can amy
youre one of us now all you have to do is take this final step and let the pain go
and welcome a world of ultimate pleasures
an arm bluish white stretches out from the void trying to grab joey who ducks its grasp
the deaders break the circle around amy as more arms reach out from the void
the voices of tortured souls twisted and warped scream out for help in the wind that bursts out of the void
hooks and chains reach out and grab the outstretched arms dragging them back into the void
back into hell
the deaders turn to winter theyre all a little freaked out
from the look on their faces its clear that this isnt at all what they expected
where are the naked chicks
its not what winter expected either
calm finish it amy
screams finish it
amy steels herself with sudden resolve
i dont think so
and with that amy slams the knife into the makeshift alter next to her
and thats when pinhead steps through the void and into this world
a few cenobites follow
all the deaders step back this is weird
even for them
amy leaps up and stumbles back as pinhead slowly approaches winter carefully studying him as he does until hes right in winters face
i see that evil does run in the family
inter is plays it tough
but its all an act
your lineage is of a craftsman
you should have stayed in the family business
i sacrificed my mortal self for that box
its mine now
it belongs to me
thats where youre painfully wrong
we belong to it
it created you and it can destroy you
to amy amy finish it
when it is done with me perhaps but im afraid ones own personal hell is eternal as you will soon see
pinhead takes in the puzzle box on the makeshift altar the deaders amy
the box is not just the map of the road it is the road itself
the ultimate experience
experience is a funny thing boy it likes to test us first and teach us later
are you sure you can pass the test
are you sure you want to
you cant hurt me
its not the first time ive heard that
they reach out from the void all around winter and stab into him
he screams out in complete agony as they tear at him and stretch his limbs to the point of ripping them off
and it wont be the last
winters screams subside as a rush of pain surges through him numbing him
hes just able to turn his head to pinhead and crack the slightest fuck you smile
winter tries to talk but the skin around his mouth is stretched too tight
when you attempted to challenge evil you entered into my domain
there is no way in but through me
pinhead gets in close to winters face
careful what you wish for
now we can see the terror in winters eyes
it just might come true
winter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains
pinhead turns his attention to the deaders
this world it obviously disappoints you all
perhaps thats why you choose to begin this journey
and as long as you so willingly accepted allow me to finish off what he started
and out of the darkness an oversized menacing chain comes flying out harpooning straight through the midsections of all the deaders lined on the right side of amy
piercing them at all different levels
then another chain harpoons the deaders on the left side
the deaders look like fish on a stringer
they dangle there suspended by the chains
to amy and as for you
you opened the box you brought us all together
you chose wisely
i didnt want any of this
they used me to open the box
i didnt choose to do anything
amy looks to marla shes got the fear of god in her
pinhead sees amy looking for help
shes one of us now amy
now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure
to a world where suffering is taken to higher level
you opened the box
i didnt mean to
i only wanted the truth
and now you have it
but knowledge comes with a price and its time to pay
what about them
we see the cenobites now with snake like tongues working their way up the line of deaders towards amy
theyre preparing each one as they pass
poking them with large pins piercing them stitching them filleting them etc
they belong to me now
they offered themselves willingly through him to me and now its time for you to do the same
amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at pinhead
it wont be that easy this time
but yes your father is with us too
and hes waiting for you
these words pierce through amy
she looks at marla now barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness
her head lifts up to amy
youre here to stop this amy
he needs your soul willingly
dont let him take you
dont go willingly
marla looks at the knife
amy gets it she only has one way out
marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes
winter is gone
you cant come back
you wont become a deader
or one of them
marla looks to pinhead then back to amy
they both know what she has to do
her final words only he can bring you back
amy sees the meat hanging off the chains
it used to be winter
she glares at pinhead with a sudden look of confidence like a light bulb has gone off and she can finally see her way out
she raises the knife high in front of her
the two snake tongued cenobites move in closer to amy
they cant wait to have a little taste
for a moment pinhead is pleased then amy begins the deader chant but reverses its meaning
my skin is real
my eyes are its too late to save real
my muscles are real
your soul is mine bones my heart my veins and and mine alone
your father nerves and flesh and meat
is waiting for you
he misses are real
what i see what i you so much
hear what i taste what i louder touch what i remember what the only way out amy klein i think what i feel is is through me
the cenobites freeze for a beat and turn to pinhead
they havent seen that before
she stares pinhead right in the eyes
i didnt give my soul to him
amy points the knife at whats left of winter
and im not giving it to you
and with that amy thrusts the knife into her chest
pinhead screams out
the room starts to fill with a bright light
the puzzle box starts to close as pinhead and the boys are sucked back into the void which closes behind them
amy looks up from the knife planted deep in her gut and smiles
she tips out of frame as the screen bleaches white and we where we suddenly find ourselves lost in some bright flickering space filled with the sound of static
abruptly the static vanishes the flickering space congeals and we realize that we are watching a television screen
and as we pull back we realize that we are seeing a news report on from snn satellite news network
we are in charless office
hes there watching this new report
images of what appear to be a terrible explosion fill the frame stock footage from a terrorist attack in london perhaps
cars on fire imploded building panic in the street etc
the door opens and his assistant betty comes in
she watches charles for a moment
i just talked to the police
shes just gone
left her hotel left her clothes left her money
no sign of her anywhere
see no amy
hear no amy
just like marla chen
apartment just left empty
the police say its to early to file an official report
off his concerned look do you think they she with foul play
off the tv i dont know i just dont know
beat too bad too
it would have made a hell of a story
beat im sure shell come walking in here any minute carrying with her my story
charles watches the report on the tv
pandemonium in the streets
its a hell of a story too
it just gets better and better
and it looks like i just may need somebody else crazy enough to go get it
maybe you have
your three oclocks here
betty leans her head out of the room signalling someone out in the hall to come in
a young bombshell reporter enters holds out her hand to charles who suddenly perks up as he takes it and leads her to the couch
as he does we move past charles and the young reporter to the tv
a reporter reports live from the scene of a terrible explosion in bucharest romania
over the continuing images of this destroyed building surrounded by police cars and fire trucks the sirens blaring over all the confusion s charles courts the reporter
its a pleasure witnesses say the building to meet you welcome you to located at the corner of our team
lets cut right to poteilari and minvara just it shall we
firefighters have i received this tape which i been on the scene for several would like to show you
and hours now
sources say the well i think its a story only thing that seemed to you could really wrap your survive the collapse of the head around
i hope your building was a this she willing to do so
holds up the puzzle box this small relic found incredibly undamaged
we move past the image of the puzzlebox on the tv and settle on the framed photograph of amy and charles in happier times smiling
probably the first time weve seen a smile on amys face since the last time weve seen this picture
we get a sense that maybe shes finally at peace
