in a perfect blue marble clouds oceans continents
a voice begins to speak
an older wise voice
well meet him later
in all its glory the most perfect self regulating organism you could imagine
we went out there we turned around we looked back we saw it
youd think wed behold and learn something
beat we didnt
the date appears in one corner of the screen
it was when we first went into space
there were four billion people in the world
the population appears in the other
and at a rate that was scarcely comprehensible we began to poison and populate our planet
date spins the population as well
the big sparkling blue marble that is earth begins to lose its luster and slowly turns gray
by the year the population is six billion
we increased by million people a year
pumped out our toxins beyond measure
destroyed our resources killed forests trees plants animals
anything that couldnt be trademarked and sold at a profit we annihilated without a thought
we killed half of what was on the planet
we didnt care
right about the millennium we got another warning
in the midst of a pond
surrounded by hundreds of dead dying and deformed frogs
we killed all the frogs
every frog on the face of the planet
wed killed species before sure even a genus or two
but this time we wiped out an entire phylum
as the frogs breathe through their skin and react to toxins in the environment faster this should have been a warning canary in the coal mine kind of thing
the last frog dies
nah we didnt pay any attention to that either
the only people who were really upset were the french
and no one really likes the french
we date and population begin to whir again
the planet grows dimmer and dimmer
the oceans grayer and grayer
by there were billion people
it took us years to go from the industrial revolution to putting a man in space
it took us only another to poison and overpopulate the planet so seriously that if we didnt go out and find somewhere else to live we realized we were gonna
die out as a species ourselves in the next two generations
a billion stars
we pull back through a spaceship unlike anything youve seen
thirteen spheres up front cuboctoahedral packing
the mev mars entry vehicle a large cylinder behind
the whole thing is slowly turning
the ship floats by to reveal red huge and very close
over which we hear houston we are go for mars orbit acquisition
you are go
engines light up in the back of the craft
the ship heads down towards mars
disappears around the back side
the word sun starts to blaze brighter and brighter filling the screen until we are looking at a writhing ball of plasma
the surface roils waves of energy pass by and a flare starts to grow and expand out from one quadrant like a giant volcanic eruption
two solar astronomers stare with mouths agape at the heliostat
monitors around record the event as well
its gotta be miles long
its gonna shut down every comm satellite on this side of the planet
alarms are starting to buzz
the good news is its directional most of its gonna miss us
science officer andy lowenthal turns to the flight director matt russert
the bad news is its directional and most of its going toward mars
sub light speed
itll take minutes to get there
let em know
he looks to the capcom john skavlem
news gets worse
theyre on backside
theyll be clear in
note all the crew in mission control wear small projected image monocles pims over their dominant eye
there are no giant viewscreens dominating the room as in missions past
when so moved the flight director can throw an image on a large general viewscreen
but unless noted there are no projected images in the room
dark side of mars
the ares is a slightly shining speck moving towards the horizon and light
commander kate bowman is at the helm
shes got a kind of quiet assurance
youd like her
mission co pilot ed santen is beside and behind her
she speaks into a mike to rest of the ship we have stable orbit
weve got three laps around ninety minutes each
in four and a half hours we will launch the mars entry vehicle
robby gallagher floats in through the hatch in the back
hes been waiting million miles for this are we there yet
kate shakes her head
shes about to respond when they just clear the edge of the planet lights hit them and
one light starts to flicker to red
and then another
some just go off
what the hell
santen reaches for the radio as it begins to blare static
bowman begins to rapidly reset states
some hold some flip back to red
things are bad but shes calm
single event upsets
all over the board
were gonna lose chips
shut it down
shut it down
safety buzzers start to go off
sep some kind of massive flare
then into the intercom gentlemen correction we will launch on this pass
santen is shutting off every system he can get his hands on
she reaches to finish it off herself
multiple event upsets
santen is out of his seat and heading back as fast as he can
gallagher behind him
alarms ring now as he rushes out the artificial gravity begins to fail
the crew madly scrambling everywhere
on the mev deck bud chantilas chief science officer s graying is pulling himself into a spacesuit
popping out of his bunk and into the wall chip pettengill s a little dour grabs a satchel of personal possessions and swims off down an access tube
gallagher and santen rush along careening off the walls
emerging onto the mev deck looking absolutely calm cooper burchenal s weathered unconcerned stops at an intercom station presses a toggle katherine you could probably cut off that caterwauling now
im up from my nap
a moment later the alarm ceases
high g couches are faceted about the interior walls crew names stenciled on them
bowmans remains conspicuously empty
santen straps himself in
chantilas burchenal pettengill and gallagher stream aboard
start cinching themselves in as kate continues to try to shut the ship down
some circuits do others flicker free flow and refuse to stop
one particular circuit will clear but only as long as she holds it shut manually mev launch release
only takes her a moment to decide
shes not happy but tries not to let her concern show as gentlemen it seems i will not be able to join you and will maintain the manual release for
the mev from the flight deck
she has no time or inclination to engage in discussion about her decision
you are go for mars descent lieutenant
on my signal
santen powers up the smaller craft
seals the door
he cant believe hes doing this but he has no choice
we are green across the board
the last of them finish torquing themselves down
gallagher toggles his intercom to bowman promise you wont leave if we dont like it there
she responds in kind
keeps her tone as light as she can
then lieutenant santen you have control authority of the mev
she holds the circuit closed
lights are starting to flicker off on the board
waiting is not a good plan
santen calls out quickly crew secure
santen slams two large buttons on either side of him
explosive bolts blow the two halves of the cylinder away
the mev is an icosahedron revealed inside
as this is space and a vacuum there is no sound
however in here its loud
half a moment later another explosion and the mev is blown free of the ares
again oddly silent
small maneuvering motors burn for a moment starting the mev out of orbit and in free fall towards mars
it drops drops drops and disappears friction blazing as
there are still free flows all over the board
bowman cant get them to shut down
they flicker pop on and off
systems start and shut down and start up again all over the ship
checks the comm again
control panel on the wall
we hear a clicking
inside the panel we see the switch sputtering on off
it fails arcs
smoke begins to wisp out
a red light comes on
its a smoke warning in sphere six
bowman rushes through a sphere thats a garden
another with orchids growing on walls
artwork on huge lcd screens
pulls open panels and slaps down banks of breakers as she goes
rooms turn dark the artwork disappears
only phosphorescent safety lights remain
bowman yanks out a fire extinguisher
sprays down the offending area
she is of course hurled across the room by the force
for a moment though it looks like shes succeeded
smoke begins to wisp out again
she pushes over anchors her feet and jams the nozzle into a fire port
this time it seems as if shes prevailed
and then a gentle voice on the intercom
she still doesnt panic
hurls herself down another access tube and
way up in the sky we can see the tiny flare of the mev entering the atmosphere
a moment later a sonic boom reaches us
bowman fights a fire in another sphere
dark now except for the flickering flames
this time we see them otherworldly round and glowing in the zero g
smokes in the air its getting hard to breathe
she puts out the fire but from the alarms its clear shes now fighting a losing battle
kate rushes in
starts pulling master breakers
lights are exploding as the power surges
shes surrounded by a cloud of glittering glass fragments
we can see the fire smoke panel lit up nearby
the news is bad
half of the lights are red
she yanks on a spacesuit
slaps on a small oxygen container
locks on the waist wrists
reaches back to what seems to be a gelatinous hood
pulls it over her head locks the front down and the helmet turns rigid and transparent
she throws the last breaker
the ship is now dead but still burning
she clips herself in with a set of safety tethers and
throws open the main hatch
the venting air crystallizes in a huge white plume
papers books cups clothing flies forth as well
bowman is sucked towards the open hatch
watching all her air escape is not a calming moment
without oxygen the fires subside and die
all of them
the ship is still and dead
fire lights are out
kate shuts the hatch
finally she lets herself begin to react
starts to hyperventilate and shake inside her spacesuit
the mev has crash landed
its a wreck
air bags deflate
half have been destroyed
the icosahedron attempts to unfold
a figure struggles out of the shattered craft collapses on the ground
it wasnt supposed to be like this
the air is gray thick
stragglers in heavy protective gear struggle through the fetid wind to an airlock on the side of
and join hundreds of journalists in the audience
in front face lit from below at a podium senior scientist harold ernest s head of the space exploration office
as many of you may know in the space exploration office began a series of unmanned flights to mars
the entire wall behind him feet by feet is a vid screen
as he speaks the images appear
not as if hes narrating to the footage but as if its voice activated
it had been determined by that mars harbored no life
although beginning with the same resources as earth four billion years ago mars didnt support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last million years
nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life
exactly as he describes it it occurs
icecaps melt temperature gradients rise etc
in the audience are hundreds of journalists watching
it was however concluded that mars was receptive to terraforming
if we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere thus holding greater
heat melting the icecaps further
we could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit
to do this we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere
resultingly a series of probes were sent each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the martian environment while augmenting the oxygen
content of the martian atmosphere
in the last years we have sent probes
the terraforming was initially successful
we see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the martian surface
red orange green black burnt sienna
every color you can imagine
valleys covered with color
the average temperature on mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades
the oxygen content began to increase as well
and then eleven months ago the o on mars suddenly began to decline
soon after all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning
we have no idea whats gone wrong
we need to know why
mans very destiny may lie in the answer
the color on mars ebbs away
we are about to embark on the greatest mission of human exploration
by using a number of heavy lift launch vehicles and a modified close lunar cargo ship we have created a vessel capable of journeying to mars
we see construction being rushed along and hab a kind of big space rv landing and deploying on mars as three months ago hab an unmanned living environment was launched
in nine days ares our first manned mission will be sent to mars
ladies and gentlemen i give you the first men and women to travel beyond the reach of earth to the next planet in the solar system
light comes up on the crew
commander katherine bowman will supervise the flight component of our mission
commander bowman has hours in space
she will be assisted by pilot and mission specialist ed santen
next and were pleased to have dr
bud chantilas come out of retirement as our chief science officer
bud brings a view as a generalist few can offer with a nobel in chemistry and a macgregor in molecular biology
he was off getting another ph
this time in
checks theology when we asked him to join us
chip pettengill who until recently has held the number two position in the terraforming office is an expert in extremophile and cryptoendolithic biology
cooper burchenal late of western biotech has left the private sector to help us
last and we are also joined by robert gallagher
santen turns to kate and quietly mutters
his mike was on
it echoes across the room
but gallaghers too quick to let him try to apologize anyhow
thats technically space janitor
crowd likes this
gallagher continues when the toilet breaks million miles from the nearest hardware store they call me
actually they called me now cause then would be too late
to be more precise mr
gallagher is the mechanical systems engineer
were glad to have him along
ernest moves on quickly
we stand on the threshold of the most triumphant moment of the millennium
science has brought us here and science will take us further
the mev is horrendously battered
its a wonder theyre alive
chantilas is propped against a rock moving a device the size of a hardback book across his abdomen
its a kind of combination x ray sonogram
doesnt like what he sees
puts it aside for the moment without discussing it with the others
gallagher emerges from the mev dragging some tools and other salvaged gear
note all communication is via the vox radios in their spacesuits
whatve we got
the radios dead
you gave me a shop and three months and i could get this thing set for orbital re entry
its staying here
santens climbed to the top of a nearby outcropping of rock
surveys the area red sky blue clouds rocks
we put up with your shit for three hundred million miles so you could crash land us on mars
just fucking great
by all rights son we should be dead
that was a decent piece of flying
we have a mission to accomplish people
well be dead in eight hours anyhow when the air runs out
cause megapilot missed the landing site
there is no more fucking mission
that puts it all into perspective
so where the hell are we
was tied to the radios
which are dead
transponder on the hab was tied to the nav computer
which is dead
didnt the boys at nasa pack us a compass
theres no magnetic core on mars
wouldnt do any good
gallagher considers all this for a moment
i dont think i like this planet
where do you think we are
as much as you can shrug in a spacesuit
santen pulls his hhc out of a pocket on his thigh
descendant of a laptop
mutters at it
it whizzes past all hab info schematics the standard degree pan from the landing site topo map of mars
zooms in to show where the hab was deployed
based on the last uncorrupted nav state and given that we were in a full manual descent with no computer correction id say
in this x mile ellipse
theres a long moment of resignation
its a little irrational but then re the hhc weve got every other mission variable in here we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and
orbit of the ares when we exited
we should be able to close in on the downrange variables
tighten up the ellipse
its about the math
gallagher cant believe it
this is it
this is that moment they told us about in high school
where one day again wed use algebra
and it would save our lives
and i thought they were fucking kidding
gallagher turns in frustration and walks away
chantilas calls to him stay in range
a thousand yards
and your radios line of sight
right i wouldnt want to get lost
he continues to wander off
we can hear them discussing drag coefficients and whatnot
it just makes him ill
gallagher stares out at the martian plain
it would be kinda cool
except for the fact hes gonna die here
hes pissed and frightened
yanks his hhc out
mutters images appear
all the hab details
stares at the map and then the degree panorama
back at the map
back at the panorama
something about it strikes him
looks at it some more
he gets up looks around
looks around some more
heads back to the guys
i dont think its about math
i dont like math so im biased
i think its about the picture
he holds out the picture of the panorama
santen dismisses him hes not a scientist hes not a pilot he should leave them alone
were not in that picture
if we were wed know where the hab was
were trying to figure this out
robby ignores him tosses a rock in the sand wraps the the degree panorama around it
screen bends and turns translucent as he does
look say thats the lander
at about degrees in the distance it sees this mountain with the funny top
and at about degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks
points now i see this mountain over there
and these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line
and then theres this other peak maybe which would put us on the line say here
which leaves the angle to the hab at about there
santen and chantilas start to manipulate their hhcs faster than you can follow
muttering to them hand gesturing cross referencing back and forth to the map as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is
space janitor first class gallagher nicely done
the good news is its an eight hour walk
theres bad news
chantilas checks gallaghers wrist monitor
youve got seven and a half hours of air
try not to breathe too deep
lets get the hell outta here
chantilas struggles to his feet
as the five of them tromp away in the giant landscape
the earth fills the screen
and then pulling back back back back
it recedes in the distance and disappears
we catch up with the ares as the final launch stage fizzles out and is discarded
a large open common space
empty for the moment
until chantilas and pettengill enter through an access tube
gravity follows them around as they walk
floor ceiling wall
a meter on the wall with a glowing g points an arrow the direction of the current gravity
chief science officer chantilas
off his nod this is trippy
hes been up so many times hes forgotten what its like the first time
youll get used to it
when you get home it feels weird you cant walk on the ceiling
gallagher comes in too fast
its just confusing
opens up a locker about three feet by three feet
he calls in to what seems to be a large tangle of silver pipes
good morning amee
step out carefully were in multi directional gravity
amee the autonomous mapping exploration and evasion unit unfolds and steps gingerly from the cabinet
about waist high eight legs stereo camera eyes
like a big silver spider
old attachments have been sawed off and buffed down
shes a piece of off the shelf gear thats been modified
when the light hits her at the right angle we can see a marine corps insignia still etched under the refinishing
how are we after launch
id like to run a systems check
as she nods shall we do the hokey pokey
just to satisfy me
she rapidly shakes each of her legs in turn
gallagher flips on a wrist panel display
built into the fabric of his suit
he sees what amee sees
take a look around
he flips off the lights
she flicks over to ir sees just fine in the dark
turns the lights back on
and how is your c
a quick calculations flash by and then good
okay run the occasional self test
let me know if anythings wrong
and back to storage
amee contracts and climbs back into her locker
gallagher shuts the door
display reads good bye and winks out
all six of them are gathered
first dinner in space
any space adaptation sickness
youll wake up all night long thinking youre falling
ill hear you scream
didnt lose a plant
gallagher holds back here a little
not a scientist not an astronaut
suddenly feels like the most junior member of the crew
bunch of the hvacs jammed from the lift off
theyre fine now
ill tell you what unless we pass a recruiting station on an asteroid and you sign up for the military you can call me kate for the next six months
as she waits he relents kate
whyd you come gallagher
not expecting this one
takes a sec i did two years as a mechanic at nascar
a year and a half at mcmurdo in the south pole
three years on subs
i had the highest military tech ratings you can get
and i went cross country once with my cousins in a motor home
this didnt seem so bad
thats why they called
whyd you come
a beat then you ever been to europe
its full of stodgy people whose ancestors didnt have the balls to go to america and try something new
earth is gonna be like europe
you might visit there and admire some old buildings and crap but you wouldnt want to live there
this was like getting a call to go with columbus to america the first time
how could you not go
i dont like europe much either son
didnt quite figure it the same way but damnation you dont turn down a phone call like that do ya
to kate you
i spent my entire life training to fly the biggest fastest thing you can fly
this is it
its the best job in the world
points to santen hes going cause he got the second best job in space
hes a little pissed about it but he still came
shes nailed him so precisely santen can only wince and look away
pettengill just pipes up
maybe no ones gonna ask and he wants to get it out in the open i was never supposed to come
i came cause my boss couldnt
he failed the medical
so here i am
they tapped me on the shoulder told me i was going to mars
i was supposed to be second in charge of the terraforming office till i died
chantilass the last
they turn to him
his reasons a little different
psalm verse they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep
so i figured how much wonder for those in space
youre going to mars because of a poem
chantilas thinks about it
he could go on about it but
theres no up here equipment is attached to the floor ceiling and walls
santen and bowman are on a large spinning bicycle driven centrifuge
by keeping up the speed hes able to provide enough extra gravity for bowman on the other side to lift free weights
theyre both dripping sweat so it must work
timer goes off they slow to a stop
pettengill comes in
he looks a bit uncomfortable
certainly out of his element
a little well puny
havent had this since grade school
yeah you musta been doing some kind of reverse thing where you get small
santens got years in the gym
muscles on muscles
bowman takes a two second evaluation of the situation
you can shower
im not done
i was gonna
santen cant believe hes being thrown out
but hes also a product of the military and couldnt argue if he tried
pettengill feels stupid
you didnt have to do that
if i didnt nip that in the bud i wouldnt be doing my job
then flying this beast is only half the job
the whole jobs to get the crew in place in shape to do what they have to do
and the funny thing is flyings the easy part
pettengill stands abashed for a moment and then his resentment just bubbles out
i just hate all those fucking guys
i feel like ive spent my entire life being the guy who was hassled in phys ed
i lost the first girl i ever cared about to some thug who could throw a football farther than i could
its like women are hardwired to think that guys who are proficient at sports are going to be better providers
its not like we hunt and kill our own food anymore
then he sells cars for a living now
i end up working on a project that may save the existence of mankind and he sells cars
this is impressively obsessive
you kept track of him
what happened to her
off his look of who
he has no idea
she grins at him little competitive
whos hardwired for what cro magnon guy
he cant help it he grins a little abashed
were gonna start with the bungees
try to quit being pissed off you werent chosen for dodgeball willya
twenty years of hating the bullying motherfuckers is a hard habit to break
and then a slight metallic sound
we push towards the mev and in
amee lies on the deck beside her storage container
a leg twitches
gets gingerly to her feet
wriggles once as if she was stiff and cautiously makes her way outside
turns and heads off into the landscape
a landscape so huge its hard to comprehend
five tiny figures progress across the bottom of the frame
theyve already come a long ways
beginning to string out
pause and regather
pettengill stops to catch his breath
how you doing
you should have put more treadmill time in
sotto go fuck yourself
whatd you say
musclehead go fuck yourself
theyre both getting louder and louder
burchenal reaches out checks their wrist monitors
were doing fine
in point of fact hes using less o than you are
we can stop a minute
unless you two want to shout at each other and use up your air
im sorry too
no ones sorry
use the moment to look around
its pretty astounding
chantilas uses the respite to re scan his abdomen
puts the device away again
hes in pain but refuses to acknowledge it
how you doing
things are as they are
look at it were on mars
pretty damn amazing
theres nothing here
no i mean theres not even a trace of the algae
he kneels down examines a rock
even if it all died thered be something a dried algal mat traces on the lee sides something
we sent up fifty two varietals
blue green black orange
anhydriobiosics chemotrauphs even a thibacillus that could grow autotrophically on elemental sulfur
not only are they dead theyre all just gone
i dont get it
its like they were scoured off the rock
maybe there was never anything in this valley
as they walk burchenal checks his hcc
if we are where we think we are map appears on a small screen he mutters to it overlays of all the algae and lichen that were on mars appear
this valley was covered with blue algae a month ago
valley back one should have been covered in an orange red chloroflectic
there should be something
they crest a small rise
below lies a valley that closes down quickly into an extremely narrow canyon
burchenal and santen check their hhc maps
this however makes sense
delineated valley fill
he double checks with chantilas
seems theyre going the right way
chantilas leans back heavily against a rock
you gotta keep moving
chantilas doesnt get up
and whatre you gonna do sit here and watch
you getting old and lazy
my spleens ruptured
theres significant internal bleeding
im not going any further
and trying to carry me will slow you down just enough that we can all die
robbys stunned frantic
well get you to the hab
lock out the spine impulse and you can walk one of us through it
santen takes charge
its his mission now
we build a litter
we take him
stern chain of command once we hit the surface starts with me
and im ordering you to go lieutenant
turns to robby ive only got about forty minutes
theres really not much pain
put me around the corner where ive got a view
they lift him to the other side of the rock
gallagher stays with chantilas a moment
inside gallaghers helmet we can see as the tears roll down
then its okay
im not sorry i came
gallagher takes one last look over his shoulder
we are already pulling back back back
tiny figures in the landscape once again
one left behind
flight director russert watches as skavlem mutters into the mike
ares this houston do you read
ares this houston do you read
skavlem continues in the b
as what do you want to do
get every dish in the deep space network pointed at mars
doesnt like it but declare a spacecraft emergency
chantilas has toppled over
we go wide wide wide and
the four of them trudge up a long hill
the summit is a dozen steps away
santen is the first to reach it
he looks out over the horizon
turns back to the others youre gonna like this
we see what he sees as do the others as they arrive not that far in the distance in the valley below they can see the lab shining in the
twenty six months of food water and air gentlemen
they run down the hillside
for the first time we get a feeling for the
bouncing sixteen foot steps
like little kids as they come bounding down
they keep running and leaping and coming
until the first one begins to slow
its not from exhaustion
and then the second and the third
its from horror
the hab is in tatters
roof is gone walls are gone
nothing but the titanium ribs remain
the insides are not much better
theres no food
theres no water
theres no air
the news doesnt improve
what the fuck happened here
burchenal continues to look around for a moment
it doesnt matter what happened
shakes his head at gallagher
hows your air
checks twenty two minutes
im not much better
what the fuck
he kicks angrily at whats left of the structure
it takes pettengill a moment to process it but
were all gonna die arent we
pitch black except for the electroluminescent panels shes stuck around the room
she cracks another one on
they work like glowsticks but the size of menus
shes jumpered the circuits
multimeters velcroed all over the place
trying to reboot the entire ship
checks her loads balances one more jumper throws a breaker
the ship groans flickers to life dies
she checks a meter changes a jumper tries again
this time the ship groans flickers to life and stays on line
the systems begin to come alive around her
panels light up turn from red to green
lights start to come on
bowman moves through
the place is a mess
soot and fire stains in some spheres
smoke damage in all
the garden is half wrecked
she manually opens a set of valves in one room
air hisses in from an emergency supply
she checks a meter in her hand checks again to be sure
folds back the helmet of her suit
bowman tries to bring the rest of the ship back to life
half a dozen systems are just plain dead and have to be locked out
things are not good
lights beginning to come up
moments away from entering front side orbit
kate opens a panel marked obs and throws a series of switches
door slides open
a small optical receiver is seen
they clear the dark side and burst into the light
on a large viewscreen bowman can now scan the surface to about a one meter resolution
starts wide scanning the edge of the horizon as it comes into view
picks up the glint of the mev
at first theres nothing but the crashed mev in profile
like a spy satellite we are an an extreme angle slowly revealing more as the ares grows less oblique and tracks overhead
then the severity of the damage comes clear
bowman tries not to react
nothing else is there
no sign of activity or escape
the footprints are beyond the resolution of the camera
theres no reason to believe anything but theyre all dead
gallagher and burchenal sit on rocks nearby
not exerting themselves
checking their monitors
maybe we got what we deserved
we ignored science and truth on one planet and poisoned it beyond repair
then tried to get science to save us on another
maybe its the inconsistency that did us in
burchenal points at a depression a few hundred yards away
then points thats what they call the datum
if there was a sea
or when there was a sea thats where it was
you can tell cause the sand was created by whats called the fluvial process where water breaks rocks into smaller and smaller pieces
were the first men on mars
even if it isnt gonna last long
then would you rather i shut up so you can die quietly
nah you can keep talking
its kinda peaceful
in the b
headed towards a ridge of rocks we can see a lone figure making its way along
he steps around the ridge
we can hear his radio whooosh to static as he loses line of sight communication with the others
up ahead of him standing on the edge of an enormous drop off just staring out into space is santen
his back is to us
pettengill walks towards him
santen still doesnt hear
santens radio is off
beethoven blares in his helmet
a foot drop at his feet
it is magnificent
as pettengill approaches and santen remains unaware the scene seems less and less innocuous
we fear for him
pettengill just walks right up beside him and stares out at the chasm as well
santen lowers his music
they stand there silently for a moment
santen has some kind of weak ass epiphany
look im sorry
i owe you an apology
ive been a dick
i pick on people who are weaker than i am
its way too little way too late
but pettengill doesnt let on
as if hes forgiven him
steps away and out of frame
we hold on santen a moment and
pettengill has picked up what would be a pound rock back on earth and is heaving it with all his might into santen from behind
it slams into him bending him in half knocking his feet out from under him
for half a moment we think santen might regain his footing
but he doesnt
he starts to fall past the edge of the cliff
grav slow motion
twisting in the air
as he falls looking up he slaps off the music the radio comes back on
pettengill leans over the edge
im gonna die
but im gonna spend the next five minutes of my life completely satisfied knowing i killed you
no you wont because
pettengill shakes his head and steps back out of the line of sight
santens last taunt turns to static
yes i will
he turns and walks away
pettengill returns to the others
he can hear over the radio as he approaches johannes kepler was the first to accurately map the orbit of the planet
but not surprised
they just figure he chewed through his air
he threw himself off the cliff
burchenal bows his head down for a moment overcome
but its not santen
its the bigger picture
its not often you get to fail when billion people are counting on you
gallaghers got more pressing problems
checks his wrist
im at under a minute here
you guys know what this is gonna be like
shock convulsions acidosis
a warning tone goes off on gallaghers sensor
he starts to gasp
opens his mouth wide
sucking in and out air thats worth less and less to his body
he begins to claw at the air
its not pretty to watch
spins about seeking some release
claws some more
falls to his knees
the others can barely watch
they know theyre next
gallaghers growing more claustrophobic and crazed
falls the rest of the way to the ground
still clawing at the air
its horrible to see
and in one last desperate angry trapped feeling move reaches up and unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it back
croaks out a faint epitaph as he collapses
fuck this planet
and hes still
and then in a last reflexive shudder
takes in the worthless mars atmosphere
and right when we think its entirely over
takes in some more
opens his eyes
im not dead
the other two are watching in amazement
im not dead
its like being at high altitude
theres not much air here
takes him a minute to catch his breath but
were not gonna die
burchenals suit alarm goes off
he doesnt screw with gasping in the suit
just opens the damn thing up and prays
it aint much
but itll do
he looks around puzzled
what the hells going on here
pettengills alarm goes off as well
much more tentatively he removes his helmet
hes not really rejoicing like the others
i thought wed be dead
the enormity of what hes done strikes him
i thought wed be dead
they all breathe the thin martian air for a moment
god if santen had only waited five more minutes
what a waste
off pettengills completely unsettled face
static on the comm clears
a brief caesura then copy
good to hear from you
we believe you may have suffered a proton field upset
what is your status
bowman struggles to maintain control
tear runs down
takes a deep breath
radio contact zero
visual shows crash site one body no motion
believe entire crew to be end of mission
ares systems check at below percent
telemetry to follow
she punches a button
starts to upload it to them
air purge in fire control degraded orbital path
current orbit unstable
thirty two hour projected failure
do you copy houston
the telemetry has come in
russert puts it up on the common viewscreen
ship status and all the failures are displayed
its a disaster
we copy that
he lets go of the mike
cant help himself
jesus fucking god
someone moves along
and emerges into an icosahedronal slice has been removed from one side and replaced with optical glass
a billion stars are brighter and more numerous than youve ever imagined
gallagher comes in bumps smack into chantilas
thought he was alone
sorry lotsa room
they lean back against the floor for a moment and stare out at a billion and a half stars
know the stars at all
pointing andromeda cassiopeia cetus lepus canis minor
were looking at what youd see south around midnight mid may if we were on earth
at about degrees
hes not showing off
he just really does know
chantilas looks at him surprised
my grandfather taught me to sail when i was a kid
fondly he made me learn the stars in case all the g
satellites fell out of the sky at once
he said anyone who put his life in the hands of anything run by batteries was a jackass
he sounds like quite a guy
he didnt like what he called the easy answer or the quick fix
he didnt want to own anything he couldnt repair himself
thinking back and oh yeah everything automatic sooner or later fails automatically usually during or immediately before a crisis
he had a lotta damn sayings
then he wouldntve approved of this
going to mars
that we killed off half the living things on earth
that after we all but destroyed one planet with global warming were trying to bring another to life the same way
kinda tricky dont you think
he woulda said we were asking for trouble
it looks like we got trouble
thats why they sent us
they go back to staring at the heavens
then i dont really get it
you quit being a scientist
you went back to school to study god
i just realized science couldnt answer any of the really interesting questions
off robbys look there are values that are fundamental to an adequate apprehension of the world in which we live that cant be expressed by equations or experiments
in that you see the hand of god
explaining acknowledgment of basic values
love kindness joy
science doesnt have much use for these
look ugly theories are wrong
we know it by insight
science doesnt want to accept that
we live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies
but its modern to think this is little more than genetic imprinting or a tacit communal cultural agreement
thats not a world i cared to live in anymore
robby stares back into the void
this is not the kind of conversation hes used to but i asked my grandfather once if god existed
he played me brahms third
then he asked me what good it was
or was it just vibration
following what good is beauty
he said if a man could listen to brahms and not believe in god he was a fool
i think i woulda liked your grandfather
robby turns to him
you didnt come on this trip because of science at all did you
thats why they let you come but youre going to mars to prove to yourself god exists
maybe ill pick up a rock and itll say so on the bottom made by god
maybe gods more subtle than you are
then you think were doing something we shouldnt bud messing with another planet
unconcerned if so its because were supposed to find something out
then lets say we didnt
and we finished poisoning off the earth and everyone was dead in a hundred years
then what was the point of any of it
music art beauty love
the greeks the romans the enlightenment the constitution people dying for freedom ideas
none of that meant anything
id rather go out and make a mistake than live in a world that bleak
no one said jack to me about the greeks and romans
shit i just came along to fix stuff
fooled ya didnt we
no one told the others either
theres a quiet moment
robby just came up to stare at the stars
wasnt expecting all this
then theres a reason the planets go around the stars in exactly the same way electrons go around the nucleus of the atom
its not an accident
theres a design at the bottom of all this
gods watching over you
i just wish i didnt think he was chuckling
gallagher burchenal and pettengill are still stunned over the fact theyre alive
there shouldnt be enough oxygen on mars to do this
we never even got close to a breathable atmosphere
then the levels started to drop and the sensors all died
i dont understand whats going on here
gallagher is rummaging through the wreckage of the hab
its been devastated
wattya lookin for
gallagher unearths a tangle of wire and chewed up circuits
he tosses it aside
it used to be the radio
i dont mean to piss on the parade guys but no one knows were here
dont you see
the good news is we can breathe
the bad news is unless we can tell somebody now we get to starve to death
the only mission left is rescue
the schematic she sent back to earth is on the screen here as well
the ship is fucked up bad
the ground crews dead your orbits unstable and youre gonna burn in less then a day and a half
beat then lets get you home
the three of them rummage through the ravaged structure
news isnt good
we could head back to the lander try to make something work there
wont make it its six hours back
and it all ran through the main computer which was half fried and dropped from a great height
shakes his head no
that aint gonna help
then burchenal of all things grins
gotta think about this scientifically
theres another radio
two kilometers from here
i didnt see any stores on the way over
i miss a radio hut
we sent it here
twenty years before you were born
think where we are
gets it were right over the edge from the ares vallis
the sojourner site
the hhcs are yanked out
there was a high density ridge ringing the valley
the algae never took there
gallagher checks his watch
we still might have a chance this pass
we wait long
they start to run towards a ridge to west
sun hangs low in the sky
only an hour or so of day left
with a goofy look on their faces
like kids at disneyland the first time
theyre standing there looking at the little rover
all those damned named rocks
our first big visit to mars
the reverie is over quickly
gallagher tosses down his bag of tools
walks over kneels beside sojourner the rover
sorry about this
he pats it once and starts power screwing off the cover
tosses another tool to burchenal
re the sagan lander rip the panels off everything around the aerial
then its a fifty year old off the shelf computer radio modem on a frequency that were not using for this mission
then why are we bothering
cause id rather die doing something than just sitting there
gallagher has cobbled together a radio from year old parts
pettengill holds the solar panels at the sun while robby carefully removes one of his two suit radio microphones
checks with a meter then solders it onto his jerry rigged radio
he adjusts a tiny pot as he continues to call out
a green led comes on flickering with his voice
does it work
well the little green thing lights up
i dont know if it works
into mike this is ares ground crew come back
this is ares ground crew do you copy
we pull back wider and wider
they are so damn alone
various return scenarios are flickering on different vid screens
okay scenario three calls for you to lock out systems and
freeflows doesnt lock out
she resets everything
maybe were trying to be way too subtle
why dont we just jettison the damn tank
because the margins for error are so small
theres enough fuel to get you home then if you dont sneeze
it makes us nervous
you want nervous
over in the corner schlissel is listening to something on his headset thats blowing his mind
he starts waving three fingers frantically at skavlem and russert
they dont respond fast enough for him
he reaches over and patches someone into the comm link
a new voice breaks into the conversations
the accents australian
commander katherine bowman
peeved this is a restricted encrypted frequency
who is this
unperturbed this is hank osterbee in canberra
deep space network mate
ive got a call for you
a call for me
from the surface of mars
im routing it through
direct frequencies follow
theres crunch of static then commander bowman
were at sixty percent
lieutenant santen and bud are gone
beat then oh and by the way we can breathe
you can breathe
not real well but yeah
then hey kate
weve changed our mind
get us outta here
wed like to come home
if the room was at a standstill before now its frozen
is there hope
if they can breathe can we live there
ninety percent of the algaes gone
its some kind of freak anomaly
mars is a dying planet
just like earth
it coulda worked
dammit it coulda worked
then through the cacophony comes one voice
it doesnt matter
theyre going to die tonight anyhow
in an hour the sun sets on mars
its going to be minus
they cannot survive in the open
theyre going to die
everyone shuts up
its ugly but true
you can walk across the south pole long as you stay moving and youre wearing insulating clothing the suitsll work you can stay warm
but once they stop moving without shelter theyre gonna die
her orbit could degrade at any time
she could auger in and burn while they chat about old times and freeze to death
its a waste
we should just bring her home
skavlem doesnt love it but we can get a free return trajectory now
shes got enough food and water to bring one person back
russert not happy at all but youre not wrong
nods to skavlem
commander this is mission control
im not stupid john i know what the question is
id ask it if i was there
and the answer is no
so lets move on
then by my calculations if i ditch my reserve tank now and commit to a three second apogee burn i stabilize my orbit for another eighteen hours
id like someone to check the numbers as my apogees in seven minutes
russert has to grin
its gonna drive him crazy and its exactly what hed do
before any of them can bitch and whine come on people you heard the woman lets get on it
the techs begin calculating madly
the crew is coming down a rise toward the hab
carrying the radio
walking back quickly
sun is flat over the horizon
shadows are long already getting cold
you can see their breath
theres some concern at mission control
about the weather
deadpan its gonna rain
its gonna get a little chilly
i could see that
its dropped about fifty degrees in the last half hour
we figure a hundred below fairly soon
bowman is doing her best to keep the tone light
but shes gotta know whether or not he thinks hes gonna live or die
it would have been nice to be in the hab
and there aint no other motel to check into
you have a plan
any thoughts on how you might
theyre back at the hab now
we cant quite tell whats going on but burchenal and pettengill are busy doing something noisy and furious in the b
crashing bashing breaking
burchenal flicks open an entrenching tool
thumbs a button edge whizzes by like a tiny chain saw
chews through something and
behind gallagher is a whoooosh of flame as pettengill gets the debris hes piled in the middle of the hab to light
hes got stacks of additional fuel nearby
were gonna have a million dollar campfire
the sun sets
first sunset on mars man has seen
red upon red upon red
fire burns behind them
sky turns black
a billion stars
and then a meteorite begins to fall
what the hell was that
she ditched the b tank
she must be figuring theres an even chance well live through the night
the ares lights up and burns for three long seconds
bowman checks the gauges
eight liters was burned
hell whats eight liters
answers herself itll either save their lives or ive screwed up getting home and ill spend the next three hundred years circling this planet
burchenal pokes at the flames
theyre spread out and low
flickering yellow and blue
i think well make it through
theres so little o this is gonna burn real slow
gallagher picks up a piece of scrap about to feed it into the flames then stops examines it by the light of the fire
it looks like someone took a rasp to it
he gets up turns on a suit light and looks over the remaining ribs of the structure
what happened to this place
everything but the titanium supports were just chewed up
could a dust stormve done this
no prevailing pattern to the damage
i dont know what couldve done it
nor does it matter right now
they sit back around the fire and relish the warmth
out in the darkness past a rise something catches robbys eye
a flash a reflection
of the fire
and then its gone
he doesnt bother to mention it
writes it off
behind a hill amee crouches in the dark
pops up again looks over sees the three men and the fire
lowers back down youd swear she was thinking then silently ambles away
the weird tableau of three men in spacesuits around a campfire on mars
a moment then you still think we had any business coming to mars
screwing with stuff
trying to spread life
you think maybe gods teaching us some hardass lesson
pettengill just makes some kind of weird gulping noise and turns away
they let him be
you talked to chantilas too much on the trip over
i dont mean to burst your bubble but gods the retreat of the ignorant the weak and the hopeless
i bet you dont believe in santa
and youre no fun at all at christmas
then not everything gets an explanation you can write down as a formula
son im a scientist
a geneticist as good as they come
i write code just like a hacker
four elements a
in different orders back the genome
and your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger
i line up unconscious atoms and they give rise to conscious beings
its like if i stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog
i do that
i chose when i chose where i chose how many fingers
i just dont hold with mystical explanations for science with organized religion buildings with different symbols on em
you spot god you lemme know
till then i put my trust in my three ph
then but i think lifes an amazing thing
and i believe that when you get it you should grab it with both hands and live as much of it as you can
which is why i am not happy about losing it on this damn ugly planet
burchenal shuts his eyes
we push in on gallagher looking rueful and
gallagher comes in
his timing depending how you look at it is very good or very bad
bowman steps out of the shower
to dry off
its too late for robby to stop or recoup
he has to tough it out and try to act like an adult
bowman sees his discomfort
i had brothers
i have two sisters
gives up neither of them were this fine
now she colors
the only way this works is if we both make believe it doesnt matter
i really tried
then maybe i should go fix something
laughing now maybe you should
he hesitates leaves
she starts to vacuum dry her hair
gallaghers half filled with regret half annoyed with himself
sighs shuts his eyes tries to get some sleep
place is ragged coffee on the workstations techs as unshaven and beat as the crew on mars
all right people we bought ourselves another eighteen hours in orbit
the crews burning pretty much what weve got on the surface so they dont freeze solid
so whatever we can come up with
has got to work before the sun sets again tomorrow and they freeze to death anyhow
what else is on mars
the janitor just built a radio out of a fifty year old rover mission
now what else is on mars
mars maps come up on all their pims
there are things on the surface
marked with various symbols
leftovers from other missions
we sent a dozen probes even before the biologics started up
eight were return missions
and theyre back
theres a viking lander
they all stare at the pims
and then schlissel turns to a nearby tech slap your forehead
were not the only people who sent stuff to mars
other overlays come up on the maps
the twenties were nothing but unmanned sample return missions
everyone wanted to bring back a bucket of mars rocks
they find something near the hab
there was euro malaysian sample return mission
knows it blew up on attempted return
looking further afield they find something else
it aint close but theres an uzbecki s
that failed to launch
argh an uzbecki probe from
is it viable
can we get plans
it was built at the cosmos factory in garagin in
theres more the factory closed eight years later
and then it burnt down
all right thats the end of that
and then schlissel spots a detail that means something to him
it was designed by aleksandr ivanovich borokovski
he was the last of the greats in the russian space program
is he still alive
schlissels pim flickers madly as he mutters at it
theres no closing date on his bio
hed be in his seventies
somebody get on the line to kazakhstan
this is insanity
a thirty year old lander built in a factory that doesnt exist anymore
he runs a deli in brooklyn
low hum of conversation a bunch of the workstations are vacant techs sleeping in cots nearby
borokovski in his best suit years old comes in led by two nasa flunkies
unhooks his filtration mask
all right i am borokovski
i am here
skys beginning to grow light
last of the fire flickering out
nothing left of the hab but a few metal ribs
stiff from sleeping on the ground
burchenal and pettengill follow
theyve lived through the night
gallagher walks off twenty paces
when we see him again hes unlocked the top and bottom of his suit and dropped the trousers to his knees
im the first man to piss on mars
burchenal and pettengill follow suit on the other side of the hab
a beat then damn
you sure get some arc in this low gravity
the suns gonna break any minute
something suddenly hits burchenal
he yanks up his pants runs to remains of the hab
looks around desperately
pulls free a metal rib
turns to gallagher
towards the sun
robby understands or doesnt bother to ask why
burchenal yanks free a shard of metal
pounds it into the sand a dozen feet from the hab
the sun is just breaking the horizon
robby is fifty yards away
a little more
he adjusts his own peg a tad
robby comes loping back
whatd we do
approvingly built a directional
now at least we know where something is
the radio crackles
good morning boys
martian weather todays clear and cold
warming to a high today of around sixty
she hasnt slept
theres notes and charts and additional hhcs all over the place
houston has an idea
gallagher burchenal and pettengill have heard the plan
it doesnt impress them
we walk a hundred kilometers in one day to find a twelve by twelve object thats been sitting there for years
are you kidding thats the best plan they could come up with
its the only plan they could come up with
reconsiders i guess that makes it best
theres an i
maintenance port on the cosmos
should talk to it
youll have to reprogram the launch sequence
the bad news is
theres bad news
ignoring him is its programmed in a forty year old dead operating system no one uses anymore
it was something called
none of them have ever heard of it
were getting a copy of it from the smithsonian
were gonna have to download it to you
lets worry about it when we get there
wherere we going
ive got coordinates for you
how bout something simpler
like how many degrees it is off from the direction the sun rose
we marked it
im figurin were within half a degree
heck we just gotta pack
he picks up a satchel of tools
everything elses burnt to a cinder
basic trig has been calculated
a triangle of scavenged wire stretches with one side along the directional the other side points their way across the martian landscape
they take a last sighting and stride off into the distance getting smaller and smaller and then on the three of them
pettengill looks doubtful
a hundred kilometers
sixty odd miles
say two and a half marathons
in twelve hours
do we really have a chance in hell
it took us six hours to go kilometers last time
we dont have the rebreathers we dont have the tanks
figure you weigh about fifty pounds in this gravity
we have a chance in hell
but not much moren that
a messenger is escorted in and taken to borokovski
hes got a copy of windows fifty years old and still in the shrink wrap
borokovski rips it open then peers at tech requirements on the box
i will need a computer with a cd rom drive
and a pentium processor
its like asking for a steam engine
whats a pentium processor
whats a cd rom
a little defensive it was all state of the art in kazakhstan
we were cut off
still nobody moves
we gotta wake up the director of dead technology at the smithsonian
schlissel comes over to peer curiously at the shiny silver disk and the ship floats through frame
we hear the familiar clink of poker chips
burchenal santen chantilas and gallagher are playing poker
burchenal fans his cards down
kings over queens
youre the best poker player in a hundred million miles
he rakes in all the chips
and no onell play for money
what a waste
see you all in the morning
santen leaves chantilas starts to follow then turns and asks three quarters kidding do you cheat
compared to what
chantilas gives up and leaves
do you cheat
that seems fair
gallaghers putting away the chips when you know what i miss
a drink sometimes at the end of the day
damned hard asses at nasa
gallagher gets a look in his eye
you got enough gear on board to splice genes right
glassware tubing bunsen burners
all that kind of stuff
yep sure do
bowman comes in
robby moves quickly to intercept her
blocks her view
i came to apologize
you were uncomfortable with a situation the other day and i made you more uncomfortable for my own amusement
its too small a ship for playground games
she can leave now
no witty comeback
beat no explanation for why the temperature in this sphere is up three degrees
she slithers by him before he can stop her to find burchenal tending a huge contraption of glass tubing bunsen burners and filtration tanks
hes teaching me
ive developed an interest in
even when you make it out of high tech glassware a still looks just like a still
stern you built a still
its a science experiment
did you know that an ounce of red wine per day actually benefits your heart
adamant so does three ounces of grape juice
grapes dont grow well hydroponically
so we ah used potatoes
youre making moonshine vodka on my ship
well yes maam
but we ran it through the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer and the impurity levels are very low
hows it taste
burchenal is the first to realize theyre off the hook
its a little rough
are you going to offer me a drink
that would be the polite thing to do
she tosses it back
thats a little rough
how much have you made
bout three liters
then youre done
dismantle the science project
offer equal rations to the crew
santen doesnt drink or approve of those who do
stern again now tell me the truth
how much were you cutting this
theyre busted again about three to one
i cant believe you drank that
i learned to fly in the navy
gallagher bowman and burchenal are there
theyve got half a beaker of vodka left
theyre all looped and laughing
i spent half of my life trying to make a better potato
and the second half trying to stop it
the things were so damn good they killed everything in their path
corn wheat barley
suddenly melancholy we fucked up our own back yard hit the malthusian wall and tried to breed our way out of it
maybe we dont deserve another chance
then he shakes it off
dont worry if we need any help on the surface im allowed to grow us some six fingered lab assistants
he cracks up again
i gotta go to bed
he heads off drunkenly
gallagher gets an idea
im in space
i wanna see the stars
he flails off in another direction
she laughs and follows him
dont go outside
a billion stars two very drunk people half a beaker of moonshine vodka
shes talking about burchenal hes okay
i bet theres a hell of a girl waiting for him back home
and a horse
he really likes the horse
he pines for the horse
i dont have a horse
thats too bad
he takes another swig
offers it to her
she matches him
can i ask you something very personal
its about bras and space
she looks at him
i dont wear a bra in space
bras are designed to hold your boobs in place on earth where theres real gravity
why would i need one in space
cause its really fucking distracting
you want me to wear a bra
not at all
im sorry i ever brought this up
the good news is neither of them will remember in the morning
then do you have someone waiting for you back home
or a horse
with the kind of jobs ive had its very hard to maintain any kind of relationship
or maybe you took those jobs cause you didnt want anyone waiting for you
no i like horses just fine
theyve floated very close
you know youre not who i thought you were at first
is that an insult or a compliment
theyre very very close
and very drunk
its when he should kiss her
but he doesnt
the moment passes
they both know it was there and now its gone
moving across the landscape
miles and miles from where they started we find the three men as they move rapidly across a dry wash across the bank and up and over a hill
and stop dead at the top
over the next ridge the landscape is covered with algae
colors like brush strokes on the terrain
oxblood brown burnt orange cadmium yellow
pettengill gets down on one knee to examine it
half inch to an inch high vibrantly colored
maybe its the longitude
maybe its the equatorial belt
maybe it doesnt matter cause we gotta keep moving or were gonna die
pettengill doesnt argue
just trying to stay alive is the great scientific mystery right now
they bound down far side and
borokovski is laboring to install windows on a year old computer from the museum
schlissel and the tech watch kibbutz
yob tyvou mot
which by the way means fuck your mother
it keeps crashing
that was part of its charm
you had to buy programs to check why the program you had already bought was not working
people installed this on their computers on purpose
it wasnt a virus
the company planned it this way
it was later discovered they owned all the companies that sold you the products to fix the product they had already sold you
i remember this
the government had to bomb the factory in the end
windows comes up
look there we go
the angle seems odd
in fact it is
its from orbit
its bowman searching on the telescope
as the picture skitters along the surface and finds them tiny figures on a landscape
in extreme profile
a few minutes away from plunging onto the night side
she marks their location on the viewscreen zooms out wide
the hab and the cosmos are marked with symbols
the computer pauses analyzes then spits them out as a little more than kilometers along their way
more calculation is done on the screen
theyre more than halfway theyve used up less than half the available daylight their average speed is looking good
theyre on time on schedule and on the right course
so far so good
ground crew this is ares
youre a little more than half
youre doing great
over radio oh yeah were doing fabulous
as she plunges into darkness we hear singing rollin rollin rollin keep them doggies rollin
theyre all exhausted and a little punchy
how long can a man go without food or water
how long can you go without singing that dumb song
burchenal looks hurt
walks another few paces
begins to sing again
gallagher turns to pettengill
theres two of us
and we can stop him from singing
then sings along instead
they only know the one line
its really annoying
what is that
i have no idea
its old though
its classic music
i dont know the classics
this sets burchenal off
he sings some more mars aint a place to raise your kids in fact its cold as hell and theres no one there to raise them if you dig
what the hell is that
you dont know any of the classics do you
he was a rocket man
an astronaut wrote that
sing the one about the dogs again
its about cows
then why does it say doggies
all this time theyve been walking across a landscape pigmented with color steel blue alizarin crimson malachite green the algae varietals everywhere
and then off to the left the algae stops
erased like it was never there extirpated in a long crooked line
what the fuck
yeah what the fuck
you said doggies
then he sees as well
they all see
cant help themselves
theyre drawn towards it
gallagher and burchenal check their course in the distance before veering off
pettengill is already heading towards it
its maybe yards away
at something indistinct can be seen
its like the line and the surrounding terrain is out of focus blurry
at the blurriness comes into focus
it moves slightly
you can see through it
at ten you can see it undulating
slowly towards us
erasing the algae the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing
and then we can see
a billion a hundred billion
little tiny translucent worms
eating the algae
pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool
carefully separates one out
lifts it up to the light to see
maybe three inches long skinnier than an earthworm
one end lifts in the air a tri part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing searching for something to eat
its fucking scary
it gets worse when you realize how many of them there are
the lines moved three or four inches closer as they stand there
they take a step back
no one can really speak yet
its a nematode
or something like one
its probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them
or theyr enot water based at all
is it something we sent up by accident with the probes
i thought we said there wasnt any life on this planet
we were wrong
maybe there wasnt when we checked
i dont know
its not from earth
beat yow and its not from here
this cant be
this cant be
burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it
gallagher looks at him
burch is upset
it cant be here
you dont understand
the odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small
the odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical
the odds that it could travel to another solar system let alone one where life already existed are
but its here
burchenal seems almost unhappy about this
it rocks his world
in a bad way
gallagher turns to pettengill happily and untroubled
well it looks like were not alone in the universe
you just discovered life on another planet pal
it takes a moment for this to sink in
then something hits robby
made by god
thats whats stamped on the bottom
thats what bud would have said
he woulda loved this
gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them
theyre kinda horrible but as he turns to pettengill you know what this means
youre gonna be more famous than darwin
theyre gonna name buildings after you
spacecrafts cities on mars
the enormity of how badly pettengill has screwed up that in the space of one day hes committed murder and discovered life on another planet begins to dawn on him
he doesnt handle it well
hes fucked up like few people can imagine
he tries to reset it doesnt work
the worm twists about starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool
he flicks it back to its relatives
and then he says something really odd name them after santen
you hated santen
he storms away
theyre both confused by this
pettengill finds a rock sits down behind it
hes obscured except for his head and shoulders
i need a minute or two
you wanna tell houston
you do it
just give me a few minutes
we seem to have come across the uh cause of the annihilation of the algae
theres cryptoendolithic life here
intercut as needed with mission control and mars surface
concerned theyre hallucinating
pettengills a bit overcome
or hed be telling you about it himself
but the discovery goes to him
baffled but though he wants to name them after santen
youre saying theres martian life
calling out from behind the rock no that theres life on mars
were not saying where it came from
but not earth
they all disregard that last bit
theyre like some kind of translucent worms
youre all seeing these
what did you think this was hypoxia
gallagher walks towards the rock we should get outta here
pettengill doesnt respond
we should get going
gallagher walks over
we hear a familiar whine
dont recognize what it is at first
until gallagher around the rock and sees
pettengills flicked on the whizzing cutting edge of the entrenching tool
shreds his left wrist
lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries
all but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground
suits awash with blood
overflowing onto the ground and him
burbling in spurts
some hits the worms
burchenals joined him
theres nothing they could do
only watch in shock
it gets worse
the worms come
pulsating and undulating towards pettengill
as if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge
a diaphanous hungry wave crests onto pettengill and engulfs him
hes covered in translucence as they devour him
gallagher and burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as hes eaten
color spreads out around him in a perfect ever growing circle
its a feast
the two of them walk along
cant tell if theyre hurrying towards something or away
theyve both figured out whats up
a beat then he killed santen
probably figured we were gonna die anyhow
beat then nobody deserves to die like that
theres a general buzz of animated scientific debate
one voice cuts through weve thawed out three and four million year old organisms from the permafrost in siberia and theyve come back to life
so even if there wasnt life there there is now
and we warmed the place up and sent it something to eat
it could have sat there for millions of years since mars cooled
rode in on a frozen meterorite from anywhere
a voice chimes in from the corner like sea monkeys
but not as friendly
they all consider that
kinda bizarre but accurate
burchenal and gallagher trudge onward
burchenal checks his watch
gallagher hands him the radio
doesnt want to hear
bowman just heard the news
its like shes been punched
it takes her a moment to recover
copy that ground crew
mission control has heard as well
a beat then requiescat in pace
the sun is way past its zenith
it hangs noticeably lower in the sky
maybe four or five oclock
burchenal and gallagher plod along
theres no singing theres no banter
theyre just trying to keep moving
bowman finds them again with m scope
computer analyzes their position
the results arent encouraging
their average speed has been steadily dropping
theres only two hours left till dark
theyve gone kilometers
and theyre projected to get
kilometers before nightfall
theyre gonna miss getting to the cosmos by about an hour
not keeping in all that straight a line
having to constantly re check their position
ground crew this is ares
studiously casual hows it goin
they look at each other
is she kidding
weve just done a little over two marathons back to back
we havent had anything to eat or drink in two days
there are these worms that want to eat us and a mad robot who wants to kill us
why do you ask
he starts to laugh
for some weird reason burchenal joins him
youre not going to like what i have to say
youre going home
bring us some chicken
they crack up anew
you have to pick up the pace
its not funny but they really laugh
were not gonna make it
at this pace youll make about ninety kilometers
burchenal shakes himself
digs into some deep reserve
picks up his speed and shouts we sleep till brooklyn
he totters off towards the horizon
what was that
coopers been singing classic music
i dont know most of it
no sleep till brooklyn
neither does he
i think he knows one line from each song
well try to go faster
we really will
hes trying to convince himself as well as her
but he does pick up the pace and push after burch and
borokovski has listened in curiously to this exchange
why is he speaking of brooklyn
hes singing classic music to keep his spirits up
the tech looks at him curiously
i studied it in college
its the beastie guys
most of the music we listen to today is based on the ground breaking work they did before the turn of the century
gallagher just stops
you know i dont care if i weigh pounds on mars
i am one tired doggie
gallagher sits down on a rock
burchenal collapses nearby
they cant go any further
burchenal catches his breath
ten k short
the sun is a finger above the horizon
redder than red breathtakingly beautiful
too bad were gonna be dead
i cant keep walking in circles
and theres nothing to keep us warm
they look around unhappily
ugly way to die
its gonna be like trying to live on mount everest
what would we do if we were on mount everest
thinks a long time
i would have brought a tent
if we didnt have a tent
robbys so tired hes confused
we dont have a tent
yeah i know
id guess youd dig a snow cave
use the snow for insulation
youve seen the ds
theres a funky looking hillock nearby
five feet high as big around
burchenal totters to his feet
goes over and kicks it
its soft volcanic rock
lets dig a snow cave
theres no snow
burchenal kicks at it again
he takes out the entrenching tool hacks at it
knocks a piece free
lets dig a snow cave or were gonna fucking die
he starts to wail on it
gallagher staggers over and joins him
the two of them start to flail away like a cross between prehistoric man and giant beavers desperate as the sun begins to set
miles away the terminus the line where night turns to day begins to advance across the planet towards them
in the dark of the shadow the frost forms a dozen feet behind and follows growing growling the cold advancing towards us with a crackling crunching freezing whine
its as if the cold has a sound
gallagher and burchenal can see the darkness approaching
losing their minds
cant tell who is who as theyre silhouetted against the sun one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears
the sun continues to drop
terminus continues its pernicious hissing and freezing approach
halfway inside now
on his knees suit light on gallagher chops away at the rock
when hes thigh deep in debris he backs out dragging the leavings with him
burchenal leaps in replacing him
dripping in sweat nutty but at least theyre doing something
the last of the sun disappears
their breath is in the air
the darkness and frost reaches them now
the sweat begins to freeze ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble
but theyve dug most of the shelter
they continue to thrash and chop away
the frost is now everywhere
gallagher climbs inside
burchenal drags a lava boulder over to seal the entrance
climbs in hooks his tool into the rock and seals it shut
its not big
the two of them are scrunched into balls
they chop away and pack the debris in the entry tunnel to block the cold
and in the midst of it all our crazy hillock snow cave
gallagher looks up to find burchenal staring at him
actually not exactly at him
at his forehead
is this some kind of cartoon moment where youre imagining im a giant chicken and youre going to eat me
its melting its a wizard of oz moment
the ice on your forehead is melting
the rocks really insulating us
we might not freeze to death
and then the enormity of whats gone on hits them
and the exhaustion
adrenaline is gone
gallagher physically droops
ive never been this tired
ive never hurt this bad
you think dead is worse than this
hell well probably know soon
we oughta probably tell someone were not frozen solid
burchenal checks his watch
were on the nightside cant reach houston
bowmans dayside for another forty five
common viewscreen shows ground crews projected position
darkside of the planet
estimated temperature of degrees fahrenheit and falling
the rooms downcast
not a word before it got dark
lets get bowman home
shes gonna wanna waste a pass trying to get them on the radio
shes got five and a half hours before the orbit starts to decay
if she has to do this so she can concentrate later on so be it
skavlem gets busy on the radio with bowman ares this is houston
their breath condenses on the ceiling
then falls down
theyve got their own weather system
gallagher watches it fall
burchenal seems kinda pissed
no i dont know why the worms are here
no i dont know why were still alive
theres gotta be a reason
a moment then youre talking about faith son
faith is another way of saying i know something you dont know but i cant tell you cause its a secret
but i dont know why i know it
agitated i live in the real world
ive lived there my whole life
im comfortable there
were not in the real world
were on mars
softly nobody gets in a rocket ship to outer space without some kind of faith
burchenal doesnt answer
but he looks like a third grader busted in some elaborate story he cant keep up
if you think im gonna have some kind of weak ass epiphany for you right here in this cave youre wrong
now why dont you get that light outta my eyes and let me try to rest
lowers the light to a dull glow leans back against the rock and
the ship slips into darkness
bowman reaches for the mike begins ground crew this is ares
do you read
off no response ground crew this is ares
do you read
the radio lies on the ground
the green light flickers with her transmissions
but little signal seeps through the rock
what there is is muffled and indistinct
zzzzz zzz zzz zz zzzzzz
and gallagher and burchenal are fast fast asleep
bowman has searched with the m scope
she picks up the occasional footprint
tracks their progress
finds some odd rock configurations
theyre just gone
finally she gives up
picks up mic sadly for one last time ground crew this is ares
it was a pleasure and an honor to serve with you gentlemen
sits quietly a moment then turns off the screen
brings up a new image
shows her current fuel status position and projected path
she begins to work on getting home
the two small moons shine faintly
a rime of ice covers everything
the hillock shimmers in the feeble light
the rock entrance is sealed over with frost
gallagher and burchenal breathe shallowly
the inside of the cave is covered in white flaking hoarfrost
lips are blue
skin is pale
gallaghers eyes open
doesnt know what
and then he realizes the air moving in and out of his lungs isnt doing him any good at all
the door is caked shut with ice
theres no air
he moves badly uncoordinated but manages to chop and shove it open
fresh ice cold air rushes in
only half responsive
gallagher grabs him drags him out
burchenal looks at his watch
it doesnt make any sense
three hours have passed
son of a bitch
son of a bitch
weve been asleep for three hours
gallagher desperately hauls out the radio
ares this is ground crew
ares this is ground crew
shes dayside again
if shes even still here
then we gotta get to cosmos
burchenal looks around
it gets worse
cant see the landmarks
gallagher starts to madly scan the night sky
we gotta keep moving
he yanks out his hcc
mutters rapidly into it
we see the map appear
hab cosmos line marked
then a star chart for mars on this day and time
he calls for it to change to a horizon projection
the machine freezes computes
brings up a horizon
it matches what robby sees
and highlights a star sitting just above the horizon that will lead them on their way
they start to run
amee rises up silently from behind a rock and watches them go
the two men run
lit by the two moons phobos and deimos fear and terror
its unbelievably cold
plumes of breath light up around them as they go
following the star on the horizon
across a valley over a ridge
over a dune
up and over the next long long gradient
they lose the star over this false horizon as they climb
theres something odd however
a faint broad wash of light coming over the lip
they crest the rise to reveal completely covered in phosphorescent algae
pale green and glowing
a mile across a mile wide
if they werent rushing for their lives it would be worth stopping to stare
across the vale canis minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass
theyre about to dash onward when something intuition its hard to say what hits burchenal
burchenals not quite sure at first
but wont enter the algae
walks left walks right
the algae glows
and then movement
in the f
a worm green glowing and filled with algae slithers through
and then another
and another indistinguishable from the plants around them theyve imbibed
and then as burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize its entirely full of worms
gallagher takes an appalled step back
burchenal considers for a moment
and yeah probably has that epiphany
then re the pass get to the closest point you can safely
im gonna go down to that end
he starts to run to the far end
what are you gonna do
burchenals far enough away now that his voice comes over the suit radio
im gonna distract them
youre gonna distract the worms
perhaps gallagher ought to give this more thought
but he doesnt
maybe its the exhaustion
maybe it just never would have occurred to him
burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance
then you ready
lemme know when it starts to clear
gallagher doesnt get it
but a moment later a shiver runs through the worms
and they start to undulate away
pulsing faster and faster until its clear in a moment or two like a giant amoebae withdrawing he will have clear access to the pass
at the far end is five hundred yards into the worms
theyve told each other
and theyre coming in pulsating waves
at the epicenter
and hears stunned its clear
burchenal tries to turn around
hes mired now
and theyre up to his waist
its a fucking nematode feeding frenzy
he cant even lift his feet
theyre beginning to cover him now
he can see the color of his suit spreading around him as they devour it
then oddly calm you were right son
theres gotta be a reason
this cant just be an accident
i dont know what the wormsre doing here or how they got here
but science dont explain it
and it pisses me off to no end
he can see now what burchenal has done
a tiny glowing figure can be seen yards away
gallaghers speechless at first
im gonna have to turn off my radio in a sec
so you dont have to hear me screaming like a girl
what have you done
finding out theres things i dont understand
that science dont know squat about
maybe even the damn earths worth saving
someones gotta give it a try
gotta find out about these worms
go get off this fucking planet
during which weve cut to gallagher cause you dont want to see this
theres two women in missoula one in bozeman
tell them each they were my last words
and make sure my horse gets sold to someone who knows how to ride
then oh my lord
radio goes silent
across the distance we can see a figure now entirely coated in luminous worms writhing wildly
gallagher leaves his light on starts to run
as robby flees we pull back further and further until hes just a tiny figure in the landscape until we are at what was burchenal
the frenzy is all but over
the phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle
the edges are the color of his suit
then blood red for forty yards
bits of bone white
and then right in the dead center as we watch gray spreading spreading as what was once burchenals brain is food for worms
gallagher scrambles up steeper and steeper to the edge of the valley and the ridge line
from the top he can see the way below is his prize the cosmos
checks his watch hopefully desperately triggers the radio
ares this is ground crew
ares this ground crew
do you copy
above him somewhere in the sky
bowman is locking out parts of the ship to conserve power on the way home
at first shes not sure she really heard that
rushes across the room to the radio interface
the worms just ate burchenal
thought you might be gone
shaky guess you promised you wouldnt leave
they both know hes caught her still here sheerly by happenstance
im about a kilometer from the cosmos
its in sight
call you when im there
gallagher heads down
bounding down the hill
no algae on his side
he leaves a trail of phosphorescent footprints as he goes
they grow fainter and fainter as he descends
bowman comes rushing in
slams up into a wall
belts herself in
its been sitting there for years
as he approaches the solar panels turn and track towards his light
its still waiting
sits on six over built legs
sample return vehicle launches off the base
liquid fuel tanks sample return container the size of a large trash can
we hear how you doing
unsettled its really cold
my fingers arent sure they want to work
you can do this
then the maintenance port has a cover
it should be marked
gallagher looks it over
minor stumbling block
finds it anyhow
he flexes his unresponsive fingers and after a try or two unscrews the cover reveals an ir port
all right im gonna download this to you
gallagher yanks out his hhc
dozen adapters in the back
finds the one that fits the old modem port on the jerry rigged radio
plugs it in
on the hhc windows comes up the cosmos launchmaster program cyrillic crudely relabeled in english
unplugs the modem so he can speak again
its still got power
you should be able to run diagnostics
theres a diagnostics check and launch check
he hits diagnostics
the two talk link up and a windows error screen comes up on the hhc warning your system has become busy or unstable
press ctrl alt delete to exit programs and reboot
i know now why it didnt launch
says the magic words control alt delete
reboots in the blink of an eye
systems check positive
its looking good
okay this thing only has two settings
on and off
one sends it all the way back to earth
as you dont have air food or water that would be bad
bowman is calculating madly as she goes on
trying to sound calm
shes anything but
we want just enough lift for escape velocity
with the weight you left at and the suit
i peg you at
it was designed to take pounds of rocks home
tanks are seven liters each
you need to take two liters out of each tank
theres a central purge youre gonna have to be exact
as she continues and you better try to find something to put the fuel in and get it the hell away from there as we dont want it to go
up when the rocket goes off
yeah it all makes sense
gallagher using the few tools he has left has unbolted the sample return container
measures its width i need you to do some math
a cylinder centimeters wide how deep is six liters
eleven and three quarters centimeters
he measures and scribes in the line
plummer my th grade math teacher is cackling like a son of a bitch
under which he slithers underneath opens the main purge and fills the big steel bucket with rocket fuel
it looks just like the guy at texaco working on your car
lugs it away from the cosmos
avoid pressing anything that says ignition
he runs it seals are good pumps are good engines ready
and the ignition power force all volts of it is dead as a doornail
the program suggests the replacement part number
and suggests he order it quickly
answers the same
he slumps down sits beside srm
he aint going nowhere
just sits there
after all this hes fucked
stares out into the distance
theres enough power to run the computer but not enough to launch
how much do you need
i need volts at six amps
and ive volts running the computer system
ignition batterys stone cold
is there anything you can use
let me look around and see if i see a high voltage source
no just rocks
in fact everywhere i look theres just fucking rocks
and more fucking rocks
then as he tries not to break down im gonna die here
she knows hes right
not a damn thing she can say
tries to maintain
looks up at one of the screens
in four minutes shes back on day side orbit
and then home
gallagher steadies himself
picks the radio back up
hes just babbling to keep himself sane for a little while
i didnt come here to be a citizen
i came as a tourist
you know visit mars check out the sights
bowman tries to do the right thing
whatever the hell that is
takes a breath wipes away an errant tear tries to be calm for him
is there anything you want me to do
thinks then tell all of burchenals women that they were the only one
sell his horse to somebody nice
then burbling up unplanned
i shoulda kissed you
theres a long beat
he shouldnt have said anything
you shoulda kissed me
gallagher cant believe it
he could kick himself
to himself okay
this is like all the worst parts of high school math and the beautiful girl youre too stupid to tell youre madly in love with
and then i get to die
what a shitty day
into radio commander bowman i am really sorry i didnt kiss you
really really sorry
only half a beat but
she bursts from the darkness into the light of day side and is gone
radio turns to static
when he goes on loved you madly shoulda said so
its too late
she never hears
he realizes shes gone
puts the radio down
he is very very alone
she sits there just gut shot for a moment
picks up the mike
houston this is ares commencing return sequence
on all the pims her return trajectory is plotted
shes to come all the way across the day side enter night begin acceleration and slingshot around the backside of mars and head home
ares beginning return she steels herself then reports the rest of the news ground crew reduced to gallagher reached cosmos failed second diagnostics
no joy no launch
while crew member is still extant mission commander declaring him e
theres silence in mission control
not everyone has followed the circumvention
what was all that
gallagher made it to the cosmos wont launch hes alive shes gotta leave him
gallagher sits there
and sits there
alone beyond imagining
just staring yards out into the distance
not looking at anything
waiting to die
hes given up
he shakes himself out of it
just feels foolish hes let himself go this far
done with feeling sorry for himself
well this cant get any worse
grabs himself to stay warm
hops up and down
on one of the hops he ends up facing the direction he came from
theres something green and phosphorescent coming over the ridge
theyve tracked him
footprint by footprint
he looks closer
its not just the ridge
theyre down in the valley with him
the ones in the front are back to translucent not glowing anymore
theyre hungry for something new
he gets down low to silhouette them against the sky
there are already four or five hundred thousand on this side of the hill
and theyre coming
i guess i was wrong
it can get worse
a lot fucking worse
shouts at them forgive me if i dont feel like getting eaten before i die
they dont really respond
except the ones in the front who rear up and seem to listen or sniff for him
and gnash their little crystalline teeth
they split now to come at him from two sides
gallagher gets caught in a dry heave
sees the bucket of rocket fuel
lot closer to them than it is to him
gathers his nerve runs grabs the bucket
drags it twenty feet back
then tilts it carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the cosmos
worms closing in as he goes
leads a fuse of fuel back towards him
it burns low and yellow in the oxygen depleted atmosphere
doesnt look like much
certainly not a defence
first worm gets near it
but his compatriots are behind him still coming
vaporizes in burst of red orange as he touches the flame
and the next
and the next
like little sparks
gallagher watches puzzled by this
and then it hits
right as the ring of flame is about to die out
the main wave touches the ring of fire
they do burn
little worm screams that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air
thats for eating the hab
and killing cooper you slimy worm fuckers
rolling waves of flame
flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm
one lands on and torches the cobbled together radio
its so damn hot for a moment gallagher panics thinking everything might explode
then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire
gallagher does a dance of triumph
however short lived
then it hits him how do you burn like that without oxygen
theres a blast of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and cosmos
knocks him to the ground
gallagher stares with wonder over the hill
he figured it out
theres a couple of dozen worms unburnt and thrown free
he picks one up looks at it
you motherfuckers stole all the oxygen
realizes and you can give it back
i gotta tell someone
it could work
it could work here
he turns looks the radio is still burning
he snatches it up scorches him
tries to put it out
drops to his knees
not after all this
it aint gonna work ever again
all the shouting isnt gonna make a difference
he knows the answer he knows how to save the species and theres no one he can tell
as he stumbles back onto his feet hes jarred the switch that links to amees display
it comes on shows the fire on the far side of the ridge
shes approaching it
gallagher stares at it for a moment
my day is not getting better is it
theres a look on his face somewhere between inspiration and fear
like hes got an idea
but it might be a really really bad one
amee skitters along
climbs up and ever so carefully peers over the ridgeline
the cosmos down below
and beneath it his feet sticking out as he works on something gallagher
he messed with her once she recognizes him
if she could bare her teeth like an angry dog she would
amee considers for a moment
makes her move
she comes down the hill
twelve sixteen twenty foot strides
doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy
and all but silently
gallagher hasnt yet responded
and then shes all the way to him
she rears up to strike and and gallagher in his skivvies bursts up from where hes buried himself in the sand avenging entrenching tool high over his head already swinging
as amee wheels back around and
he chops off both her eyes
sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic marine cranium from behind
whatever hes hit the jolt stiffens his arm throws him off
the tool stays embedded
she runs headlong into the cosmos
smashes stumbles falls
and before she can get back up to her feet
he wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid
robust real time response to the environment my butt
gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can
checks his watch
whatever hes racing theres only minutes to go
deep within the electronic entrails of amee he dredges up her esource
size of a soda can
power cell that runs her for year and a half
hums as he removes it from its shielded container
he rips open a panel on the cosmos yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in
it doesnt fit
hes got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy
glues it in place
runs the launch diagnostics on his hcc
it flickers goes to yellow flashes on and off to green
he yanks back on his suit
grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the esource
stuffs it in a side pocket
looks at the top of srv
wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top
this oughta be interesting
checks his watch
its now or never
the ship is just about to enter the darkside
bowmans got her suit on
screens show the apogee launch and a slingshot around the backside
houston this is ares
i am go for return ignition
copy that ares you are go for return
she slides into the darkness
gallagher watches the second hand come around takes a deep breath and
fuck you mars
slaps the helmet shut
then the grinding of thirty year old pumps
and then a giant flaming roar
and it launches
gallagher epoxied to the top is pinned flat
face squashes eyes bulge
ship starts to glow friction
thirty year old paint chips off like tiny shooting stars burning away as this reverse comet leaves the atmosphere
we can hear him roaring at the top of his lungs as the rocket blows by and
pulls away in the b
from filling the frame to a red circle below
atmosphere thins the friction and flame decrease and disappear
turns from deep red to maroon to black as he blows through the clouds into the outer reaches of the mars atmosphere and beyond
the engines stop
he comes skittering back from the edge of blacking out
he floats silently orbiting the planet slowing receding into the distance
we see bowman through the front viewport
making the last of her preparations
downhearted and slow
then shes strapped in now
counter on a screen is ticking down
she tries to allay her horror at what shes doing
reaches for the mike
no answer if you can still hear me
im so sorry
and i shoulda just kissed you
radio three quarters cooked lays there on the still smoking ground
nine eight seven
then just breaking the horizon way out in front of her a shiny metallic speck breaches into the light
its a man glued to thirty year old spacecraft
she slams down an abort button as with the other hand she twists the radio over to the suit to suit frequency
gallagher is sucking on a few useless raspy breaths
he can see her ten kilometers away
barely hanging on
they stare up at the screen awaiting her return ignition
she should be clearing
starting the burn
shes not showing
still not showing
theres secondary object in orbit
bowman has flipped a set of joysticks collectives out from underneath the dash in front of her
shes shouting at the computer
power the oms power the r
i need roll pitch yaw x y z
theyve figured out whats up
some are thrilled others are freaked
no theres no fuel for maneuvering
skavlem shakes his head
not a chance
nor would she listen to him
she is going to burn fuel to rescue this man without enough to come home
very russian of her i like this girl
which is exactly what she does
i want ten milliliter bursts
and puff puff puff
ares bit by bit dives down into a smaller orbit to catch up with the cosmos
bowman grabs the whole orbital maneuvering assembly yanks it out of the flight deck turns and rushes from the sphere
as he watches it come closer hes depleted what little air there was in the suit
and starts to die
its now an empty docking port
bowman careens in
no artificial gravity here
floats as she shouts at the computer
i want a degree
the ship turns end over end
kate plugs the maneuvering deck in with one hand slaps an oxygen bottle on and her helmet shut
seal this level
open the dock
clips herself in just in time as the doors behind her slam shut and the giant doors in front of her open
and in front of her yards away is the cosmos
he doesnt respond
because hes unconscious or dead
his head lolls there
theres no time left for subtlety
bowman yanks a device off the wall
it looks like a mm rifle with a power cable
points it at him
its a huge laser pointer
lights him up
shouts to the computer
the ship pauses like its thinking
object out of range
emergency braking will commence in seven seconds
ares turns off the pointer
kate throws it angrily aside
theres a linear acceleration track on the side of the wall with a line thrower attached
she clips in
grabs something the size of a medicine ball with seventy nozzles sticking out of it in her free hand
and shouts last acquisition
and it does
the linear accelerator wrenches her violently along the track and hurls her into space
reel and a line behind her whir
its like the worlds largest angler has cast her into the void
tumbling she half regains her bearing holds out the mini thrust ball
shouts something at it
drags her by the arm towards cosmos
she hits it
twisting flailing way too hard
half knocks herself out
recovers clips in with the tether on her suit
gallagher is completely insensate
she shouts something in the silence we cant hear
the reel in the ship starts to spin
so damn fast its smoking
the cosmos is reeled in oscillating wildly at the end of the line
the ares giant by comparison is about to swallow up the tiny srm and its two passengers
dock comes careening at them
theyre both going to be squashed like bugs
bowman slashes loose the line
and fires everything left in the portable thrust engine at once
blue plasma flares
her arm is wrenched wildly pulled from its socket
the cosmos spins degrees as they plunge through the opening of the port into the ares
theyre on the lee side as the cosmos hits the far side of the dock like a freight train
the docking doors slam shut
the room is buffeted in white mist
she grabs an emergency cutting tool hooks it into the front of gallaghers suit
rips it open from stem to stern
hes limp unresponsive
not after all that dammit
she checks he has no pulse
a first aid station is bolted into the wall
she grabs him by the shirtfront launches them over there
takes out a pair of pre gummed heart paddles slaps them onto his chest and fires them
gallagher is thrown entirely across the room by the current
slams into the far wall
opens his eyes
starts to breathe
hey i knew you wouldnt leave without me
beat you promised
theyre all stunned
theyve got a serious problem now
this is ares
recovered ground crew
request recalc and reconfiguration for return flight
orbit is stable but diminished
the scientists have been figuring madly
and they dont like what theyre coming up with
we can get em back
fifty extra days
and were not going to be able to support food and and air for two people
motions to skavlem
bowman and gallagher listen as that travel has been increased by approximate two months
concern is that available life support is untenable for duration and current crew strength
worms tried to eat him robots tried to kill him and theyre worried about this
scientists sent us here
scientists figured the whole thing out with mars
i hate to bring this up but they got us into this whole mess in the first place
hell they shouldnt be allowed to drive cause they miss the turnoff as they consider the ramifications of the internal combustion engine
he picks up the mike
how bout we come about halfway home and you send a ship with air and food and stuff to meet us
in the middle
and we dont have to get all the way back
as russert lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over borokovski motions to schlissel and his new friend the tech
i know where there is a rocket in uzbeckistan
a friend of mine has kept it
out the window mars drifts by in the view port
bowman looks at it kinda sadly
so much for saving humankind and living on mars
i guess the worms took care of that
the worms are not our enemy
theyre our friends
hes pulled the container out of his pocket
unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters
she recoils in horror
you brought them back
are you insane
its okay im pretty sure they dont like titanium
then were gonna live
hell maybe even back on earth
maybe anywhere we want
and the reason were gonna live is the damn worms
yeah they ate all the algae and damn near everything else but they store and excrete oxygen
she finds this hard to believe
but he explains
thats why we could breathe
you should have seen these suckers burn when they went up
i had some time to think about this
i was in orbit for six minutes before you found me
i shoulda been dead
but the air locked in the suit was almost pure o
cause of the worms
we didnt just find a new place to live on we may have saved our old one
toxic waste theyll eat it
poisonous landfills theyll eat it
shes still trying to absorb all this
its been a long couple of days
gods got a sense of humor
hes giving us another chance
if we can all get along this time
burchenal knew somewhere that it wasnt the science it was about having something to believe in
bud always knew
wonders of the deep
we just had to go to mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on earth
its not all about us
we cant kill everything and survive
bowman looks back at mars
you wanna tell them back on earth the species is saved and were gonna live
how should i know im the janitor
then look commander
i just fought off half a million screaming nematodes and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa mars and i was wondering
if you could kiss me
she kisses him back
they continue for a long damn time
finally they break apart and
its an extra fifty days back
gee wonder what well find to do with ourselves
as she starts to laugh
