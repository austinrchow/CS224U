de souza a serene landscape mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains
in the middle of a field stands a bare chested man facing the sunset
he is harris forty ish greying but handsome and very fit
his hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity
he seems filled with some sort of transcendental power
now an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him
he turns and walks away from us
camera adjusts and reveals once the home of victorian gentry a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect
but now as harris walks towards it the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle
music echoes faintly from within its in a gadda da vida by iron butterfly
if the music didnt place the era for us the battered vw minibus parked outside the house does its covered with flower paintings slogans and the ubiquitous peace sign
as harris approaches the house a dozen or so young people rush to greet him and embrace him
extending his arms out to enclose them all he goes inside
this was probably a stately parlor in its day
there is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture
there are muslin curtains on the windows crude paintings and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches
despite the squalor there is a neatness to the place
now the camera begins to roam through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper
various where did she go
was here a moment ago
cynthia come on honey we need you
cynthia come out come out wherever you are
the suns going down were losing the moment
hey mellow out we got ten minutes i like checked the almanac okay
ready or not here we come
all these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones
finally the camera pans over to a little storage alcove beneath the servants stairway
a hand reaches in and opens the door and inside we see cartons antique toys
and then cynthia a pretty year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted nervous expression
there you are you naughty girl
you almost made us lose the sunset
come on honey times wasting
she shrinks back from the hands that are pulling her up and out but they prevail and shes up and on unsteady feet
the camera stays with her as shes led back down the hallway
faintly no please
i really dont want to do this
cant i just wait for you
i im not sure about this a set of hands moves in separates cynthia from the others
revealing victor a handsome youth a few years older than cynthia
easy cyn easy
you dont want to do this thats okay
the voices stop as everyone awaits an answer
camera pans across the common room to the end we havent seen yet
in the center of the room is a big cistern or font
as we watch harris has just dunked someone in it
the person steps out laughing sloshing in amber liquid
standing around are other people some already dripping wet others awaiting their turns
some are clothed and wet others in varying degrees of undress
it all seems slightly off slightly eerie despite their smiles and cheer
harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub pushes his hair back
no victor its not okay
here at unity house some things have to be done
slight smile in unity
this is one of them
he wades closer to the camera within reach of cynthia victor and the others
its the kind of a smile that inspires trust
cynthia do you trust me
she nods immediately
and have i ever lied to you
she shakes her head
the people around cynthia begin to get into the tub
some remove their clothing others get in clothes and all
toddlers and infants are held by their parents and playfully splashed
then i say to you now
to all of you now
that this will be the ultimate joining
of man and woman
parent and child
humanity and godhead
he looks at victor who reluctantly lets cynthias hand go gets in
now only cynthia remains
there is no shame in this
just the final break with the old world
as night falls we start a new day
a day of unity
a command but warm come to me
his last words melt her remaining resistance
moving like a sleepwalker she steps into the tub wades forward
then she stops looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans
runs her hand through it
her eyes widen
the sun almost gone now red light reflecting on the gabled windows
even the battered vw van looks good in this setting
cynthia come back
we cant do it without you
we must have unity my lovechild
unity now and through eternity
cynthia you cannot run
you belong to us forever
the faint sounds of splashing and then footsteps skittering on tired wooden floors
and then windows blow out
splintered beams propeller through the air
the vw camper on the lawn rocks with the shock wave
then a second explosion blows the victorian cupolas and widows walk off the roof
from somewhere in the distance we fire is consuming whats left of the building
rescue workers and firefighters are running back and forth
a plainclothes detective he nods to some uniforms steps around some debris to move closer to the scene
he puts his collar up against the spray which leaks from firehose connections
seeing one of his men he shouts over the din
what have we got
twenty four bodies inspector
as he says this both men watch as firefighters carry out a scorched and blackened corpse that looks like a year old mummy
its set down on the ground beside other blackened bodies partially covered by tarps
as the body is set down it crunches and a piece breaks off
wasserman blanches wipes his mouth
cause of fire
some kind of explosion
gas main methane too soon to tell
god only knows
lets hope he doesnt keep it to himself
we got one
we got a survivor
get a stretcher and oxygen over here wasserman and the cop run up the slope with the others
medics run around the parked vw which drips water and chemical foam
rescue workers move a fallen beam and pull a soot blackened form out of a hole
as the camera pushes closer we see that it is cynthia
her clothes are torn and singed and she is unconscious but as they work on her we see that she is largely unharmed
busy frantic make room make room
get that airway in
i got a pulse whoa its faint
talk about lucky she musta fallen in the basement
first and second degree burns
come on people move your asses
wasserman tries to keep up as they carry her on a stretcher towards an ambulance put her inside
it roars away siren wailing
music comes up and over its magic carpet ride by steppenwolf
filtered authorities continue to investigate yesterdays mysterious explosion and fire at unity house the controversial new age commune headed by self styled guru adrian harris
people died in the blaze
thirteen year old cynthia weston the fires only survivor remains in guarded but stable condition at county general
in national news newspaper heiress patricia hearst was abducted from her bay area apartment shortly before dawn today
a communique from the so called symbionese liberation army demanded that
the doors crash aside as cynthia is rushed in on a gurney
the ceiling lights flicker past us as they move her into the emergency room
blood pressure over were losing her
wheres that cart
okay its climbing
watch the eeg
brain activity shit damn low
we begin a series of dissolves including a wasserman who appears first in his clothes from the fire then two other wardrobe changes b hospital personnel at first the harried
and rushed emergency staff and then the more blase regular doctors and nurses c various medical equipment as a series of diagnostic tests are run on cynthia
d cynthia first in her fire scorched clothing then as it is cut away and then in several hospital gowns first white then green then blue
p hospital charts and files with ever changing over this no sign of physical damage but neurological functions still depressed
sorry inspector no changes
patient comatose after days
brain scan shows minor irregularities pupil function within normal range
still no sign of consciousness
still comatose after days
sorry inspector well call you if theres any progress
still comatose after days
patient moved out of intensive care
as the montage continues titles begin
now we hear various news broadcasts which come up and over fading in and out with the medical voices
if desired tv newscasts might be seen as well on a hospital rooms set
filtered in and out intermittently audible the mother of martin luther king junior was assassinated today while she played the organ in her sons church

the head nurse looks up smiles at a young floor nurse as she walks past
from somewhere we hear a springsteen song on the radio
what happened to your windsurfing lesson
i changed shifts with nancy
picking up charts well
time to weed the vegetable patch
we follow the young nurse as she goes into bored the nurse goes to the foot of the bad checks the chart there
she moves past monitoring equipment which shows only subtle movement
as she begins to take cynthias blood pressure camera continues on into the bed and we see cynthia she is now a fully grown young woman in her late s
she is curled up in a fetal ball
finishes her work and then gathers some bottles from the side table
she goes to the door and then reacts to a sound
she looks around puzzled
meanwhile we see and she doesnt that there is increased activity on the monitors
faint weak no
stunned the nurse drops the bottles with a crash
recovering her composure she darts back to the bed watches flabbergasted as cynthia continues to stir her arms weakly battling half realized fears
the young nurse hits an alarm grabs cynthias arms to prevent her from pitching out of the bed and then doctors and nurses are scrambling all over the room and
as the din rises we flashbulbs pop and the hospital spokesman grins clumsily famous for fifteen minutes
theres eight or nine reporters here all of them wishing they were on bigger stories
in mid speech twelve years two months
is that like a world record for a coma or something
the longest one on record is years
the first reporter closes a notebook leaves
does she remember anything about the fire at universe house
lieutenant nee inspector wasserman is there
hes grayer paunchier but the raincoat is the same one
correcting unity house
no she appears to have no memory of the accident itself or the days leading up to it
its not uncommon after serious trauma
what happens to her now
have her family or friends been notified
we stopped looking for any family ton years ago
right now we re planning to transfer cynthia to dr
berrisfords neuropsychiatric clinic
its right here on our grounds and dr
berrisford is familiar with both the neuromuscular problems a patient like this will encounter as well as the inevitable mental readjustment that will be required
the reporters filter out
wasserman is already gone
as it is clumsily set down
another foot slides forward
cynthia is standing inside a set of parallel bars
shes pale weak looking
a physical therapist is at her elbow egging her on
come on just a few more steps
cynthia blinks as if just processing the therapists word takes some adjustment
i have to rest
young lady youve had fifteen years of rest
camera adjusts to show dr
in his s avuncular he wears half framed glasses and a sweater vest under his medical coat
two pieces of tissue paper mark his razors passage on his neck
now walk to the end of that platform or you wont got any chocolate ice cream
something about berrisfords mock stern tone bores in on cynthia gets a reaction
she gropes for an answer
i hate chocolate ice cream
then walk to the end of the platform or ill shove an entire gallon down your throat
cynthias eyes crinkle with confusion
and then ah she gets it
a joke the first one in over a decade
she smiles and its a beautiful smile
setting her jaw she makes a renewed effort and reaches the and of the platform
the therapist and berrisford both move quickly to catch her and set her down in a wheelchair
to the therapist thatll be all
berrisford begins wheeling cynthia along
they leave the therapy room go down a corridor
note passage as per location
as they go by other patients and staff theres a general buzz as people whisper about cynthia
peering at berrisford am i supposed to know you or something
ive looked in on you from time to time
but thats hardly an introduction
youve been transferred into my care cynthia
i m doctor s
berrisford consulting chief of neuropsychiatry and head of the berrisford clinic
fumbling it c consulting cheev chief of
oh forget all that
just call me what my staff does
she likes this mans directness the way he doesnt condescend to her
berrisford parks her and site down across from her
what kind of doctor did you say you were
berrisford notices one of the tissues on his neck
scowls flicks it away
obviously im not a surgeon
as she laughs im a psychiatrist
puzzled why do i need a psychiatrist
cynthia youve been out of touch with reality for over ten years
your recovery goes beyond your muscle tone
you have to ease into life
into interacting with other people again
into a world thats changed so much that sometimes i get confused by it
taking out an appointment book now my assistant dr
goldman has a group therapy session every day
im putting you down for it starting tomorrow
unsure group therapy
he shows his badge to the doctor
im lieutenant wasserman
i left a message with your secretary
rising meeting him halfway and i left one with your desk sergeant
a hard whisper i told you this would have to wait
you shouldnt even be here she cant help but listen as they continue in lowered tones
ive waited fifteen years
thats long enough
now i want to speak with miss weston
miss weston is still recovering and is in no condition for a prolonged interrogation
tight smile then dont prolong it
ill be brief with her ill be gentle with her ill let you know when shes ready e excuse me
they turn and look at her
doctor berrisford whats this all about
this man wants to talk to me
berrisford starts to answer but wasserman rushes in
quietly slowly as if to a child thats right miss weston
i just have a few easy simple questions
patient phony smile about you
and about unity house
cynthia looks at him strangely turns to berrisford
sotto why is he talking like that
is he one of your patients
lieutenant wasserman is a police officer
and the word patience isnt part of his vocabulary
wasserman scowls not enjoying being the butt of a joke
he resumes his normal tons which is far from diplomatic
whats the last thing you remember before
before the accident
then how do you know it was an accident
a beautiful sunset
harris smiling at me
writing harris he was the leader
cynthias eyes are far away
the memories come back
the words are slow but vivid
chief cook and bottlewasher
smiling executive in charge of dreaming
we were all together
all working to make a now world
that last night there was a
brow furrowing gathering
a sort of
she winces rubs her eyes
im sorry thats all i can see
this unity house
was it a cult
i dont understand the question
a cult cynthia
a syndrome of society you have been fortunate enough to miss
theyre popular with impressionable people the penny press
pause and lazy policemen who like to blame them for crimes they cant solve
wasserman closes his notebook gives berrisford a cold stare
i was there that night doctor
i watched them stack those bodies
men women children
they looked like year old mummies
they broke apart like year old mummies
if it was an accident
if it wasnt
the person responsible could still be out there
pause and hes probably as interested in miss westons memory as i am
he turns nods to cynthia
he goes out
cynthias breath comes in short gasps
finally she calms
i dont like that man
that makes two of us
he sits beside her again
but as long as youre here
smiling i can keep him away
camera tightens on cynthia as she considers this
the room is cheery commands a view of the city
a video camera sits unobtrusively in one corner
six people sit in chairs in various stages of interest and or boredom
they are miriam an attractive woman in her forties who chain smokes designer cigarettes connie smiling chipper
ed overweight friendly lana pale worried looking and gilda tiny frightened withdrawn
she sits with feet pulled up on her chair arms wrapped around her knees
camera adjusts to show cynthia driving her electric wheelchair into the room and into a place in the circle
long haired with the staccato delivery of a stand up comic he smiles
well now that were all here we can begin
cynthia im dr
goldman and id like to welcome you to our little group
i dont know how much my colleague dr
berrisford has told you about my methods
i have my detractors
but i have my successes too
were going to get you out of your depression
were going to got you out of your neurosises
were going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee one with the little holes here
i can see us now on a desert island
you me a portable waterbed as cynthias eyes widen dr
alan goldman comes into the room sighs with weary familiarity at ralphs antics
actually alan doesnt look much more like a doctor than ralph
ralph sit down and cut out the shit okay
goldman i was on the verge of a major breakthrough and you blew it
when he sits cynthia
im doctor goldman at least last time i checked
and i doubt if my welcome can equal ralphs but ill try
this is the borderline personality group
and you are now a card carrying member
whats a borderline personality
dont ask him
hes making this up as he goes along
a borderline personality is one that cant be accurately placed on the neurosis psychosis arc
as a personality syndrome it encompasses identity crises chemical addictions emotionalism anxiety standing screaming like sam kinison you forgot violent mood swings
he sits smiles sweetly
he also forgot suicidal tendencies
but as one whose previous reincarnations stretch back to ancient atlantis well suicide is meaningless anyway
and dont forgot binge eating
pause gourmet binge eating
sweetly to cynthia i told you he was making this up
if everyone is finished breaking in theyre not finished dr
goldman they wont be finished until they have her feeling as miserable and pathetic and confused as they are
i am confused see
to the group i hope youre all happy dr
i dont really know what im doing here
i dont think i meet your description of a borderline personality give yourself some time cynthia
well help you work on it
and i dont really know what im doing here
he said he thought that this would help me
fit into the s
miriam cracks up
honey you want to fit into the s youre already two divorces one condo and a yeast infection behind
why dont you just catch up with the s and move to cleveland
if i can offer a more practical suggestion
why dont you talk cynthia
about something close to you
stop beating around the fucking bush goldman
just come out and ask her
to miriam do you have to be so crude
come on cynthia
dish out the dirt
tell us all about unity house
gesturing a marquee the last gasp of the age of aquarius
building a better world through
tie dying your undies
im sorry to disappoint you
i dont have those kinds of stories
back off miriam
cynthia just tell us about the orgies
ralph im going to bore you
she thinks for a minute starts to speak
shes hesitant at first and then the old memories come forward
shes sincere earnest
what we felt
what we believed
was that if people could become selfless enough if they could free themselves from their egos they would experience a
thats where the name came from
we had a dream about a perfect society based on trust
on totally committed togetherness
we werent trying to change the whole world
we were just trying to change each other
everyone is affected by her sincerity
acting out bullshit
as everyone turns astonished
gilda gets out of her chair slowly walks towards cynthia
takes her hand
it didnt matter if it worked
all that mattered was
widen from a tv screen which shown the above moment
as the group session continues under camera pans to reveal berrisford and alan watching the tape
gilda hasnt said three words in three weeks
and now cynthia comes in with this love peace and woodstock routine and
am i missing something or what
shes espousing a total belief system
a kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model
isnt that interesting
theyre adopting it embracing it
too bad we cant follow through on this
berrisford the people in this group
some of them are deeply disturbed
cynthia doesnt belong with them an experiment for one session fine but in the long run alan
weve opened primary channels of communication
youve opened them alan
lets not rush to throw away our progress
neuroses are hardly contagious
a few weeks in the group wont hurt cynthia
with luck shell overcome her memory trauma
that would mean progress
not to mention getting lieutenant wasserman off my back
in the meantime
he stands puts his hand on the younger mans shoulder
she seems to like you
see if you can get her to open up and lets press on
pause with a united front
a united front
satisfied berrisford smiles goes out the door
alan sighs and looks at cynthias image on the screen
patients in different stages of fitness use the equipment some with supervision others on their own
hettie berrisfords chief nurse a selma diamond type comes in with a tray of medication in paper cups
she works her way over to where is doing log lifts on a bench
shes in a leotard and leg warmers and theres real color in her face for the first time
drop down to first gear honey
its miller time
she fumbles on her tray for the cup marked weston hands the pills to cynthia along with a cup of juice
what are these
beauty secrets from the orient
look what theyve done for me
cynthia laughs takes the pills
hettie moves over to ralph whos just finished doing bench presses
ralph you in a cooperative mood or do i have to tie you up again
he takes the pills she gives him smiles
she just looks at him taps his mouth
of course the pills are still under his tongue
hettie gives him a shot in the solar plexus and he gulps
hettie hands him the juice
next time i hit lower
she moves on to other patients
ralph moves over to cynthia
shes crazy about me
watching cynthias workout youre coming along
a regular rocky
the flying squirrel
rocky the fighting stallone
on her blank look
i keep forgetting you just left the twilight zone
hey why dont you come up to my room and ill bring you up to date
ive got a vhs vcr a cd and mtv
youre making this up
he just grins
she slips down to the floor does some stretching exercises
sounds like a complicated world
how do you handle it
well whenever it gets to be too much i just let all of the negative stuff out of my body
you mean with meditation yoga what
i just make a little hole and let it all escape
he pulls open his shirt
on his chest and arms are dozens of scars in neat little rows
cynthia swallows stunned
nonplussed ralph buttons back up
uh uh here comes the assistant ayatollah
as ralph exits cynthia looks around puzzled
ay a toll ah
then she sees alan
buy you some lunch
he starts to help her up
she pushes him off gets up with a theatrical hop
they walk out of the therapy room
impressed enough to call me a cab
im not sure i follow you
ive been talking to ralph
he told me about his
personal therapy program
as alan winces and ive been watching the others
goldman they belong here
they pass lana and miriam who are swallowing medication from hetties tray
the two women patients wave at cynthia who smiles
as they walk please call me alan
doctor goldman is my father
thinking and my grandfather
i think my first baby toy was a stethoscope youre changing the subject
trying it out alan
im feeling stronger
im getting used to things like vc esses and mcds
i want to leave
carefully your parents died when you were a child
we havent been able to locate any relatives
he stops at the elevator doors hits the button
where would you go
i guess id just look up some of the old hands from unity house
crash with them for a while
thinking do people still say crash
gently there arent any old hands left
the fire that injured you
it took everyone also with it
theyre all gone
cynthia reacts as if struck
has to loan against the wall to catch her breath
i knew there were deaths
im afraid so
im not saying this to upset you but the sooner you realize that that whole phase of your life is over and move on the better off youre going to
why dont you bring this into the open
talk about it in group
oh heres our ride
saying this he turns as an elevator opens
its pretty crowded
he holds the door for her
confused talk about it
seeing hes waiting she straightens moves into the elevator
could somebody hit one
to him talk about it in group
is that the answer to everything around here
the doors close
everyone huddles in the compact space silently politely
the elevator heaves into movement
it hums as it whisks down the shaft
the overhead fluorescent light in the car is weak
it flickers off and on momentarily
nobody ever said it would be easy
and it works for a lot of people
gently its not working for ralph
or his chest
pleading tone cant you at least transfer me
get me in a group of people with problems a little more like mine cynthia we dont have a lot of patients whove been in a coma for over a
the light gets weaker
finally it just goes out
there is a general sigh of annoyance from the passengers
the light flickers on every few seconds giving off the effect of a strobe light
youd think with what they charge here they could pay their electric bills relax
theyre probably giving shock therapy
for alans benefit it works for most people
then cynthia is riveted by the sight of something across the elevator
in the light of the next strobe like flash we see harris
he is staring at cynthia
staggered disbelievingly she moves behind alan looks over to the far corner again
harris is gone
suddenly the elevator jerks to a halt but the doors dont open
passengers groan annoyed
oh great the emergency bell starts sounding
cynthia still confused gets shoved against the back wall as the passengers busy themselves pushing buttons
cynthia bumps into the man next to her
she looks up at him
it is harris
harris reaches out to cynthia
she cries out jerks away slamming into alan falling to the floor
jesus lady relax
were on the ground floor let me out
let me out
cynthia is on the floor
she raises her head
someone is on the floor right across from her
his face is burned and skeletal
he unity cynthia
now and forever
he has no eyelids or lips
cynthia screams struggles to her feet knocking over another passenger
now its chaos in here
let me out let me out
alan help help
cynthia you cannot run
you belong to us forever
struggles across the crowded elevator catches her in his arms
the elevator doors suddenly open
cynthia literally tumbles out of the elevator staggers along the wall holding herself up
alan runs out to aid her
the passengers get off the elevator looking at her oddly
a custodian runs up and turns off the alarm
cynthia what happened
hes alive whos alive
pointing hes alive
right over she stops
the elevator is open and empty
the passengers watch her some concerned some voyeuristic
now they drift away
alan just stares at her
berrisford sits listens intently to alan
hallucination flashback i dont know what to call it how about psychotic episode
no no she doesnt fit the pattern addictive personalities can be borderline
you know that patiently she has no history of drug abuse theres other kinds of addictions
standing pensive we see it in these fringe religious groups
these instant creeds with pseudo messianic delusions
youve heard how she talks about unity house
perhaps thats her drug
perhaps shes going through a withdrawal of sorts
her memory lapses about unity house are equally symptomatic
theres some violent turmoil under that pretty little facade
skeptical you put her in the borderline group and she became one
i believe she went into that coma a disturbed young lady
fifteen years later
nothing has changed
we can read the name on the locked security door albeit backwards
a security guard watches a basketball game on a portable set
this is not the room we saw when she was comatose but a brighter more residential arrangement
cynthia sits on the bed watches as hettie counts out pills for her
cynthia swallows them hesitates at a red one
this ones new
itll help you sleep
explaining sort of a post elevator cocktail
cynthia scowls takes it
hettie goes out
cynthia lies down on the bed stiff
turns over once or twice
sighing she picks up the tv remote shakes her head at the myriad buttons
finally she finds the right one clicks it
shes come in on the middle of a group therapy scene from the bob newhart show
note or maybe the snake pit or shock she watches until she realizes what it is then clicks it off
hettie leans over the security guards desk
the guard groans in frustration an the basketball game ends
extending her hand pay up
neither notices a dark figure passing by close to the camera
cynthia lies restlessly in her bed
she hears footsteps coming closer
they stop at her door
she looks over
there is a shadow moving in the crack under the door
the doorknob turns
cynthia sits up
she reaches for the button to call the nurse but then the door is open and the figure stands there silhouetted
the figure comes forward
cynthia backs off the other side of the bed and turns on a light
it is victor the boy we remember from the opening scene
the years have been kind to him
he stands there the dim light spilling on his army field jacket and bell bottomed jeans
oh my god she practically leaps across the room hugs him with all her strength
look at you
marveling little cyn
impressed not so little anymore
vic this is just
fantastic its the most incredible
how can you be here
it is after visiting hours
they said that
that everybody died
smiling do i look like a ghost to you
rapid fire how did you survive
how did you find me
is anyone else whoa whoa
its a long story
looking around let me tell it somewhere else
i feel like im in like the pentagon or something
cynthia grins grabs a light jacket
then lets go awol
victor peeks out the door
an orderly passes then disappears
victor and cynthia tiptoe out sprint down the corridor to a stairwell marked exit and they are gone
victor takes her hand and they run towards a battered vw van
we recognize it and its slogans
youve still got zeke
she runs her hand along the dusty side lovingly and then they hop inside
the van drives away
its a tacky but cozy building circa
zeke pulls up rattling to a coughing halt
they get out head up the steps
they come in turning on lights
its a dingy couple of rooms but lush with its variety of objects
everything looks like it came from the age of aquarius beanbag furniture paper tiffany shades on hanging lights blacklight posters hanging macrame planters
cynthia loves the room and everything in it
but she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner
its of her sitting serenely in a meadow the unity house perched prominently on a hill in the distance
in the doorway the bare chested figure of a man may or may not be barely visible
cynthias clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene
but her face is that of todays cynthia
did it by memory
i tried to imagine
look like today
guess i came pretty close
more beautiful than i ever was
softly then you need a new mirror
she smiles flattered
suddenly a cat jumps up on a crate
thats chairman meow
cynthia picks him up
victor takes out a bottle of tequila and two glasses
you still havent told me how you lived
i really cant remember anything about the
it wasnt an accident
his eyes are far away
a lot of people back then they hated unity house
hated harris and his dreams
dreams of peace
that hate fed negative energy into the cosmic vortex
something bad was bound to happen
that hate was so strong
so envious of what we had
he has squeezed the shot glass in his hand so hard that it explodes
cynthia jumps and thats when he notices it
very normal oh fuck youve cut yourself she comes over binds his hand with a dishcloth
he holds onto her
i guess talking about the past can be a little dangerous
he pours a shot into the remaining glass
lets drink to the present
pause to us
passes the glass to her
there is a drop of blood in the glass
she doesnt see it
he pulls her close
she seems to malt in his grasp
the cat jumps down
slowly they kiss and touch each other
they stop and stare into each others eyes
he moves his hand over her shoulders neck through her hair
she is completely his
half a dozen candles illuminate the room
cynthia and victor are making love
not violent but slow passionate dreamlike
they are completely enjoying each other
the satisfaction seems spiritual
they stare into each others eyes the entire time
they are lost
gradually victors rhythm builds
as his momentum increases as the ecstasy nears cynthia accelerates too
heaving gasping they are approaching a beautiful climax
but just when it seems victor is on the verge the very threshold he stops and jumps violently out of bed
victor paces around the room practically bouncing off the walls
oh my god
i cant believe it
what a great idea
is something wrong
not wrong cynthia
the most right thing in the world
he goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box
he holds it with a coy expression like a kid hiding a frog
cynthias annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his exuberance
their tone with each other remains loving kidding
are you going to tell me your little secret or should i just got dressed
im sorry cyn but i just got the most incredible idea
its absolutely beautiful
do you want to know what it is
he sits on the bad
i was just thinking about what we were doing here together
i should hope so
wouldnt it be incredible if right at the perfect moment right when were coming if we did it
what we were meant to do of course
puzzled meant to do
that last night
at unity house
no victor i dont
distant they all got to go
you and me
we got left behind
while they went on
chuckling guess thats why they say life aint fair
he opens the box
inside it are two pistols
we can fix that
stiffening my god victor
put those away he ignores her checks the cylinder on the revolver the clip on the automatic
this is so great
i mean ive been living with all this shit thinking about you searching
and you hell you dont fit in with ralph and miriam those other flakes
berrisford and goldman theyre a waste of time h how do you know about them
i never he slams the clip home closes the cylinder
we had the answers way back then
unity now and forever
cynthia this is our second chance
she shrinks away from him on the bed
he bounces closer like a kid at a pajama party holds out one of the pistols
okay you do me and ill do you but wait until i say go
hey get rid of the sheet
let me see that grown up body
he grins puts the gun to her head and gets an top of her
i dont want to do this
yes you do
you know you do
hes holding her down
hes getting into it
oh cynthia its so beautiful
god god no were on the edge of space and time
he spreads her legs under the sheets
shes struggling against him but its no use
hes too strong
hes coming closer
continuing cynthia its happening
put the gun to my head
jesus vic no
yeah oh yeah
oh yeah a shot sounds
cynthia bolts up out of bed
the candles are out
victor isnt in the room
cynthia drenched with sweat slowly catches her breath
she looks around confused
she goes into the other room
it is dark except for a fire in the fireplace
the flames reflect oddly on the slick surface of the oil painting of unity house
she checks in the kitchen
she looks back in the bedroom
the apartment is empty
shes just calming when meeow
the cat leaps out of nowhere startling her and then running out of sight
very nervous now she sits on the couch and starts pulling on her jeans and shoes
the camera moves around her revealing the entire apartment
we see every angle
it is completely quiet and still
the camera settles at one angle on cynthia
a shadow behind her moves
where are you going
cynthia jumps from fright
i thought you
leave you all alone
he pulls her into his arms
vic are you
kissing her has to be
kissing again the stupidest question i ever heard
he keeps kissing caressing
he looks at her oddly
what are you talking about
relaxing never mind
i had this
welcome to reality
he touches her soft face
he runs his hands down her neck
they kiss again she now completely without reservation
their embrace is so all encompassing that when she opens her eyes its only then that she sees she is kissing a burned and scarred face with only clumps of
puppy black muscle hanging on the bone
it is harris face the face we saw in the elevator
cynthia gasps fumbles backwards off of the sofa
whats the matter
she looks back up at him
hes victor again normal again
she knocks over a tequila bottle
its spilled all over the floor
she is speechless
he picks the bottle up
why did you pull away
i think id better go
shes over by the door
victor comes and presses against it so she cant get out
please let me out
i dont understand
what did i do
its not you it
i just want to go
you know maybe you belong in that clinic because this this is crazy
we were having a good time on her look im sorry
look what we were feeling
it was special
she softens it was unity
distantly unity now and through eternity
cynthia you cannot run
that does it
pale she scrabbles at the doorknob opens it runs out
you cannot run
you belong to us forever
she runs out of the building past zeke
she looks back
victor is in the window waving firelight dancing behind him
the reflection on the glass makes the painting on the wall look totally aflame
cynthia has her thumb out as the cars whizz by
a sweaty looking driver eyes cynthia
she just looks off depressed and afraid
she gets out of the car and goes in the main entrance
she makes her way to her room looking tired distraught
she lies on her bed exhausted trying to sleep
she gets out of bad
shes looking for an office
she goes in one marked dr
he looks up from his coffee sees her ashen expression
pulls out a chair
listens as the words tumble out
his expression changes
and then as she breaks down sobbing to concern
he holds her
reaches for his car keys
they are travelling along the highway
he turns onto another street
they pull up in front park
camera lingers long enough for us to notice a puddle from an oil leak exactly where zeke was parked
the manager a fat woman in a muumuu waddles ahead of them a huge keychain clinking with each of her steps
apartment b right
alan looks at cynthia
b or not b that is the question
she chuckles at her own wit arrives at the door
they step inside
the place is completely bare
cynthia is stunned
of course it is
i dont show rented apartments
anyway what you see is what you get
one bedroom gas range yadda yadda yadda
supposed to be six months minimum but you seem like nice kids so if you want a month to month we can work it out
this is impossible
alan i was here
he was here cynthia is staggering around the room looking everywhere
she stares long and hard at a dust free rectangle where the painting
might have been
to the manager how long has this place been vacant
bout six weeks
couple a deadbeats
their damn kids tore the hell out of it too alan i dont care what she says this is it
look look pointing theres a double door closet in there on the left
alan goes in
alan looks and sees the closet as she described it
as he comes back out well
cynthia a double closet isnt exactly a positive i
what are you two talking about
you wanna rent or what
cynthia looks around suddenly points to a stain on the rug triumphant
there look thats where i spilled the tequila
on her knees desperate see
its still wet
apologetic hon i think thats from the ceiling
camera tilts up
there is indeed a corresponding damp spot directly above the one on the rug
as we watch a drip plops down
damn plumber was supposed to fix it last week
we in business
wasserman slams his hand down on the desk furious
cynthia jumps squeezes alans hand
berrisford sits quietly leans forward and picks up the pan holder wasserman has displaced
you wait twelve hours to tell me about this
am i supposed to be grateful for your civic mindedness
i told you the unity house case was still open pointing at cynthia and shes the only lead
you should have called me the minute you found out calmly found out what
lieutenant if i called the police every time one of my patients experienced a fantasy or a delusion youd have to move in here
sharp stepping forward it was not a delusion
victor lunes was here the security guard didnt see anyone then the security guard needs glasses
alan tell them on the spot the apartment did match her general description a one bedroom flat with a beige rug
victor isnt generic victor is dead
dead for fifteen years youve seen his body
it was burned beyond recognition but there was i
i knew it i knew it cynthia
weve all done it
tumbled out of bed positive that weve just lived something that was only a dream firmly damn it it wasnt a dream i was out there
no ones denying you flow the coop miss weston
you wanna prove the rest
lemme get a policewoman to stand by while a gynecologist checks out your plumbing
well see soon enough if your ghost left a calling card cynthia hauls off and gives wasserman a tremendous slap
she goes to the door looks at the doctors
she goes out slams the door
wasserman rubs his jaw checks his mouth
ive been waiting and waiting for her to finally show real anger real emotion
this could be a breakthrough
sincere thank you lieutenant
wasserman holds a filling in his fingertips
camera pans past a row of pillows
we widen see that each member of the group has a big pillow in front of them
first off were all going to feel a little silly and maybe look a little silly
a la groucho especially in that shirt youre wearing goldman
she sits looking very distracted
as alan continues speaking he occasionally looks at her but to her relief deliberately doesnt single her out
amused but pushing on but this technique works and were going to release some of our hidden aggression
whos going to go first
pause how many helpless goose had to die to fill those stupid pillows
as everyone groans none lana
want to start
lets talk about the geese again
nice fat ones with all the trimmings all right how about if we all start together and eliminate the wimp factor
he starts pounding his pillow with a steady beat
gradually self consciously the others join in except for cynthia
standing walking around the circle okay
what are we feeling
as she pounds we used to do something like this in the royal palace in atlantis
but we used bags of dried kelp
your brain is a bag of dried kelp chiding ralph
pounding im pretending this is my first husband
no maybe my third
grinning can i have a baseball bat
please people lets work at being serious
he moves behind cynthia whos still unmoving
leans close whispers
i know you had a rough night
but you have to participate
she sighs starts to pound the pillow
at first shes very distracted but then she gets into an unconscious rhythm
all of them are finally and legitimately exorcising personal demons
okay thats better
now lets hear some emotion
let it out
miriam gives a very theatrical scream
theres some laughter but others try too
gilda begins to give little angry yelps
ralph is really punching some ancient enemy
connie does a respectable if modest scream
ed snarls with more anger than wed expect
begins hitting the pillow with growing strength
her eyes are far away
she begins to breathe heavily
camera tightens on her
she closes her eyes
when she opens them she reacts to
the scene in exactly like the first time we saw this room with one difference the hospital group therapy crowd sits in the room
they are oblivious to the change around them
now their pounding gradually unifies becomes a background voodoo like drumming
cynthia is speechless
she looks at then in amazement but none of them notice her
suddenly she sees hes across from her smiling
again he sleeks back his hair in that amber liquid
you failed me cynthia
you failed all of us
harris holds a wooden match
with it he presses back a fingernail
it snaps off and bleeds
harris watches cynthia
we were supposed to be together
in this world
and in the next
camera widens to take in the cistern of liquid
we see the dripping wet unity members
it was going to be perfect all of us taking the same journey
you shouldnt have run
you made us wait for you while you slept
all those years
he presses back another nail snap
camera widens further
now we see something we didnt see before a dozen or so plastic jerry cans marked gasoline danger plammable
the waiting time is over my lovechild
its time for you to join us
hands and faces everywhere are soaked
you know you want it
her throat muscles constrict but she cant speak
she looks over at alan who seems not to see any of this
now eyes widening in horror cynthia looks down and sees a pool of gasoline spreading towards her
it washes against the pillow her knees
you know were your family
you have no choice
he takes the match and strikes it through the pile of nails
the nails scatter
come to us cynthia
its time to die
dont lot another take your place
come to us
the match is lit
he throws it off
it falls through the air
lands on the soaked carpet
an explosion of flames
they rush towards cynthia it is a blood curdling and heart stopping a scream as ever heard
there is a flash of light
cynthias scream trails off as she throws herself back from the pillow
the unity house members and harris are all gone
the group therapy people all turn to her in amazement
open mouthed she drops the match shes holding to light a cigarette
it sizzles on the rug
alan stomps it out rushes over to cynthia who sags in his arms cynthia sits in a crumpled sprawl in alans office
the room is decorated in comforting tones with sierra club posters and outdoors y souvenirs
the late afternoon sun steams in through the partially closed blinds
alan sits beside cynthia on the couch concerned
berrisford sucks on his pipe makes notes
wasserman rocking on the legs of his chair jots in his own little notebook
softly tense they
they sang songs as they stacked up the white containers
because it was going to be their break with the world
a world that didnt understand them
i dont remember if they took a vote or if harris just
but they all agreed
crying from happiness as he drenched them in the gasoline
under his breath jesus
i knew it was wrong
when he threw the match i was at the other end of the hallway
there was a flash
like a wind or the hand of god picked me up threw me
the ceiling fell in
when i opened my eyes
she looks up i was here
hettie appears in the doorway tray in hand raises her eyebrows inquisitively at alan
alan nods immediately hell yes
hettie comes in gives cynthia her medication
wasserman closes his book looks thoughtful
to wasserman if thats what happened why didnt you find any evidence of arson
the plastic jerry cans wouldve burned up before anything else
we knew thered been an explosion
we just didnt know how or why
berrisford stands approaches wasserman as the police officer closes his book moves to the doorway
you must be pleased
closing a case after
what is it twelve years
who says its closed
the medical people look at him
cynthias thoughts are elsewhere
whats that supposed to mean
when the fairy princess here woke up she said she didnt remember anything about deaths
now she remembers they committed suicide
but she of course was innocent
who knows what shell remember tomorrow
running for help
or pouring gasoline on the fire
he goes out
that mans a candidate for shock therapy
with a car battery right to the cojones
i am guilty
they look at her startled
im guilty of lying
to unity house
i promised to be part of it
they expected me to keep my word
pause they still do
she stands goes out
alan and hettie look worried
he turns to alan
still think she doesnt belong in the group
alan just looks at him
cynthia in her bathrobe wanders out of the shower in between the dark steamy rows of lockers
she passes lana and miriam
miriam is dressing and lana is putting on a swimsuit
nothing like a hot shower huh
cynthia doesnt hear or see them
she settles on the far end of the bench
she sits there blankly
lana nears with great trepidation
are you okay
cynthia looks up
are you all right
after that session today i im fine
cynthia starts to dress ignoring lana
lana stands there for a moment very awkwardly
youre a decent person
mean spirited witch like some people
she thrown a look at miriam who just smiles pleasantly
and well if you need a friend here
distant tone all my friends are dead
rattled lana backs off on the verge of tears rushing past miriam who has observed all this
lana wait a minute she didnt mean it shit
miriam closes her locker and comes over to cynthia
i know lanas a mealy mouthed little prude but she means well
i probably pull her chain too much
shes reaching out like all of us
try and help her
i cant even help myself
miriam looks at her puzzled then exits the locker room heading back to the ward
beyond the lockers through a doorway we see lana lowering herself into the pool
blue ripples line the wall beyond
echo affect be cleansed
the sound of the voices unnerves cynthia
she presses her hands against her forehand in pain
we are tight on cynthia
we hear splashing
cleanse the heart of your mind
a bright white light melts across cynthias face
she looks up
something draws her forward
she begins walking passing behind clothes racks and lockers
then somehow the shadows of these things become the shadows of trees and then cynthia is which leads down to a pond
twenty or so people are gathered at the edge of the water
we see the unity house in the distance
cynthia moves behind a tree to watch
harris stands waist deep in the pond
the unity house members all sit or stand on the shore
harris holds his hands out in a gesture
a girl comes forward through the group out into the water
it is cynthia the younger cynthia with long hair in a braid
she smiles at harris as she nears him
he clutches her hands
behind the tree cynthia watches herself absorbed
harris looks into cynthias eyes
he touches her face
you are part of the whole
he grabs her by the back of the head and plunges her violently under water
cleanse the heart of the mind
he yanks her up
she smiles exultantly
he dunks her back down
cleanse the soul of the self
he yanks her up again but its not cynthia
before she can catch her breath shes plunged back down
shes yanked up but this time shes not in the pond shes in that gasoline filled cistern
cleanse the spirit of the body
he holds her under
she starts to move her arms around to grab hold of something to pull herself up but harris is too strong
she flails around desperately
alarmed she moves forward distant cleanse the spirit
lanas gasping inhaling water turning blue
harris is possessed
her movements slow
her eyes close
she is completely still
he looks directly at cynthia
i warned you cynthia
i warned you someone else would take your place
his hand withdraws from lana
her eyes open
no life there
were in the clinics swimming pool
on the edge of the pool cynthia screams drops to her knees in horror
the clinic custodian and some staff run into the room
someone wades out to lanas body drags it to the concrete deck tries futilely to pump life back into it
across the pool cynthia flails at the people trying to help her
tight on cynthias arm as a clear liquid is injected into her vein
we widen see berrisford has injected her
alan watches concerned
cynthia flails on the bed already reacting to the sedative qualities of the drug
he killed her he killed her because i broke my word
he said hed take someone else and he did
she wanted my help
he took her
shes out cold
behind the doctors in the doorway the other clinic patients press close curious
hettie pushes them out and down the hallway
move it people this aint a sideshow
get back to your rooms
alan looks down at cynthia with genuine concern
but berrisford eyes her totally clinically
thinking aloud fascinating
shes a textbook specimen from a collective environment an immersion philosophy run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with messianic delusions
unity house at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity exciting himself that would indicate shes symptomatic of a hypothetical borderline personality syndrome
among cult followers all externalizing their anxiety
turning what do you think
alan looks at him disbelievingly
exploding i think shes fucking freaked out about lana
a shrug possible
the patients file past the nurses station taking their meds from hettie
they look unsettled
aside to ralph did you see the swimming pool this morning
the cops are all over it
next theyll send in the fucking coast guard
lot of good itll do lana
he smashes his fist on the counter denting it
hettie looks at him
ralph were gonna start billing you for these outbursts
ralph just crumples his medication cup and throws it towards her
she glares at him doesnt say anything
cynthia and the other women from the group sit in a waiting area
connie sits in a sunbeam looking ethereal
gilda is nearby unmoving
tear stains on her cheeks
drowning isnt so bad
i remember when i died in atlantis
it was like failing asleep
you know whats bad
when i was in the great fire of london well let me tell you hearing this cynthia chokes back a sob jumps up and leaves the room
miriam whirls on connie
connie i dont know about your previous lives but in this one youre a shithead
she follows cynthia
cynthia is on the bad crying
miriam comes in sits beside her
cynthia jumps at the weight on the bad calms when she sees who it is
honey you cant blame yourself
lana was an unhappy girl
sometimes unhappy girls do foolish things
she didnt kill herself
cynthia sits up
it was harris
from unity house
he comes to me miriam
he talks to me
he reminds me that i was supposed to go with them that night go with them through the fire
to the next world
they waited while i was in a coma
he told me that if i didnt join him he would take someone also
and he did it miriam he did it
miriam gets up her face a mixture of sympathy
sympathy and something else
she lights a cigarette
involuntarily cynthia flinches at the spark
you dont believe me do you
i believe that you believe it
and i also believe that shooting you up every time you get the heebie jeebies aint gonna do shit for your real problems
we gotta get you out of here get you to some nice place at the beach or the mountains where you can fight your demons in your own way
but i dont know anyone
i dont have any money
you know me
skeptical and you have money right
despite popular opinion to the contrary i have not always been the career borderline psychotic neurotic that i am today
up until a coupla years ago i was a writer a reporter a damn good one too
hell i really kicked some ass with that selectric
she seems lost in thought for a moment
unconsciously she scratches her wrist
a wrist where we notice for the first time a purple scar across the veins
turning i was on the staff of a magazine
well some people called it a rag but it was home me
you heard of it
shaking her head diplomatic i was in a coma
well when they took me off to the funny farm saul hes the editor he said i was always welcome back
maybe this is the time
see if i can go to him tell him your story i could get a big advance
id share it with you and wed be set
i mean girl your story has everything
death hospitalization weird rituals maybe a little romance ive seen all those longing glances between you and goldman what
and now with poor lana we got a little mystery
hell youre not an article youre a goddamned mini series
i dont know
cynthia let me be honest
this is a great story and it means a second chance for me so okay theres some self interest here
but i really think you need to tell people about unity house
about the way decent ideas and dreams got twisted into something sick and poisonous
you owe it to the world
you owe it to yourself
its your life and you have to ask yourself how you want to live it
sharper if you want to live it
cynthia turns mind made up
lets do it
cynthia walks along with miriam towards the banks of elevators
i think i know a way to make a phone call
well have you out of here tonight
miriam suddenly stops almost paralyzed with anxiety
this is the right thing to do
of course it is
mums the word
alan is coming down the hallway towards them
they move towards the elevator
good to see you socializing cynthia
to miriam see you later
miriam then gets into the elevator
the doors remain open alan turns to cynthia
how are you feeling
he heads off in the opposite direction
cynthia watches him
she turns back towards miriam
miriam is alone in the elevator except for one other person
miriam smiles and waves
cynthia smiles and waves
from behind miriam harris all burned and puffy smiles and waves
the elevator doors close
alan whirls around
cynthia rushes to the elevator
she bangs on the buttons
she pounds on the doors
everyone in the corridor turns to look
he starts to approach
she runs to a stairwell
cynthia sprints down a flight
she goes out onto cynthia runs to the elevator and pounds on the button but the elevator car has already passed
yelling into the door miriam get out
she races back to she flies down the steps
we can hear alan tailing her
she swings around a turn into a flight and trips
suddenly shes rolling down a she slams into a tree
we see the unity house in the distance
shes trying to get away
there are people pounding through the brush all around her
she gets up and runs along the path into the forest
we want you to stay with us
you mustnt be afraid
she is in total panic running blindly
branches thrash her face
she can barely see where she is going but she comes to a halt when she reaches a dark precipice a cliff which seemingly has no bottom just black as
the people are getting nearer
shes over here
we see someone nearing through the brush
no pain cynthia
theres no pain
come with us
share with us
take my hand
cynthia looks down the cliff
take my hand
cynthia backs away
she starts lowering herself down trying to get footing
some rocks slide out
cynthia take my hand
the orderly rushes to her but she wavers dizzily and falls down the half flight
shes dazed but she becomes alert when she sees the orderly approaching
she picks herself up and runs
she gets to the elevator
the door is just closing but it opens again against a purse miriams purse
the elevator is empty
cynthia whips around looking for her
orderlies and nurses are moving towards her
at the opposite and of the hallway a window is broken
cynthia runs to it
there is a womans scream from the street below
cynthia looks out and down
we know what she sees
she covers her face
an orderly takes hold of her
she is docile now almost weak
alan runs up
he looks out the window
so does a nurse
the nurse crosses herself
cynthia is escorted away amid the confusion
the camera is moving forward towards the window
it seemingly goes out through the window
the frame is filled with bright blue sky
silence except for a slight breeze
someone is falling through the sky
it is miriam
we see her closer flowing down the wind rushing up round her
she is happy
cynthia its really quite beautiful
the ground comes rushing up and we slam into it
its not a session
its a wake
cynthia sits face half in shadow
they want us all now
they want us with them
whether we like it or not were going cynthia were all upset by whats happened
but lets not get
harris promised us eternal bliss on the other side when were all together
miriam was going to write a story about me
he killed her because she was going to help me got out of here
youre not listening to me
he wants us all to die
he wants you all with them and its because of me
sobbing its all because of me
berrisford addresses a pack of about thirty reporters and photographers and cameramen
berrisford what would you call two suicides on your promises so close together
id call it a tragic coincidence
unfortunately borderline personality disorder is indicative of a pre existing disposition towards suicidal tendencies
what about the commune girl
has she confirmed that the fire was some sort of mass suicide
as that is a police matter i am not at liberty to comment on it
speaking of the police doctor isnt it true that they suspect that the recent deaths may not have been suicides at all
thats completely absurd
where do you get this nonsense
a smug smile from lieutenant wasserman
he confirmed to me that hes assigning some of his officers to the hospital grounds until further notice
pandemonium as the other reporters seize this information
rapid fire doctor berrisford are you cooperating with the police
berrisford do your patients have a history of violence
i have work to do
no further questions
and flustered for once he leaves the room
it is raining
cynthia sits in bed in the dark
we see the charred and burned harris sitting across the room in a shadow
cynthia looks over at him
youre in pain cynthia
he reaches up to his face and peels off some skin
it crackles and oozes
he peels off more
your pain is my pain
we share it all because we have our love
our love will never die
dont make me take another of your friends
keep your promise lovechild
she stands fumbles for the switch knocks over a glass and turns on the light
he is gone
as she stands there in shock a hand touches her shoulder spins her around
she gasps its alan whos just opened the door
he looks at her worried
i didnt want you to be alone
she sways dizzy sags in his arms
looks like i was right
connie is sitting on her bad
she takes her pills from hettie dutifully
ed comes in
what are you doing here
you know me at feeding time
he takes his meds from her smiling
chews them loudly and sloppily until she grimaces and goes out
then the minute the door closes ed and connie are in each others arms
they kiss like characters in a harlequin romance
coming up for air why didnt you tell me before that you were a prince of ancient atlantis
it slipped my mind
she kisses him passionately again
he breaks the clinch pulls her towards the door
theyll have bed check soon
i know a better place
alan site on the counter across from cynthias bed
he plays with the hinged mirror on the wall
i dont know if you want to hear this or not and frankly i dont care
as he toys with the mirror we see a canted reflection of first cynthia and then the hallway
a nurse passes by
as she listens
you are no more responsible for those deaths twelve hours ago than you are for the ones twelve years ago
something catches her eye
connie and ed walk by
thinking otherwise is putting you in a self replicating spiral of depression
and that puts me in a bind
what do i do write more prescriptions
you need to face reality not get medicated out of it
harris has appeared in the mirror following ed and connie
cynthia jumps up heads for the door
alan catches her by the wrist damn it cynthia you cant run away from this its harris hes going to do something to connie to ed
alan slaps her
tries to hit him back
get mad get angry but not at me at these fantasies
she stands on rocky feet unsure
connie and ed come to a door marked utility
ed looks around cautiously and opens the door relieved that its still unlocked
once inside the small space he kisses connie
he pulls out a pint flask of schnapps from his bathrobe pocket
he gives her a swig
wistful nectar from the grapes of atlantis
no fooling you
he leads her back to a door thats labeled danger authorized personnel only
the lock is busted open
they go in
there are metal grating steps leading up to a platform that sits adjacent to a huge spinning turbine its six foot blades whirring at top speed
air ducts lead in and out of the space
connie is uplifted frightened exhilarated
their clothes and hair are blown around
they ascend the platform and sit across from each other
they each take a swig
they kiss softly spiritually
im so happy
the door to the utility room closes
connie and ed stare into each others eyes
they are lost
the camera moves in and out between and around them exploring the depth of their absorption
the camera moves towards the huge spinning turbine
its sound builds to a tremendous roar
we see connie and ed through the door into the turbine room
the door is pulled closed by someone or something
the knob locks
cynthia keeps looking at the door worried
miriam and lana were both deeply disturbed women
miriam tried to kill herself before
lana was obsessed with the morbid
you heard her in the sessions
you cant twist what they did into something other than what it was
just then all the lights go out
in the darkness he stumbles towards the light flicks it
the door opens
in the dim light of the hallway emergency lamps we see cynthia go out
damn it cynthia come back
trying to follow he collides with some furniture
darkness and confusion
cynthia passes by the camera
a moment later alan comes by looking for her
other patients come out and wonder
a nurse streams by
its just overloaded circuits
everyone please go back into your room
camera adjusts to show an elderly skeletal custodian edgar on the phone
the turbine room upstairs
he hangs up well set it straight in a minute
somethins caught in the turbine
edgar comes up to the utility door but it wont budge
he walks off
this is a low passageway between floors
edgar has to stoop under the ducts and pipes
he comes to a small hatchway in the coiling above him marked caution turbine
there is a latch which has to be pulled to release the hatchway
he yanks with his frail body
the latch barely moves
a trickle of blood streams out at the edge but edgar doesnt see it
edgar yanks and pulls with all his might groaning and heaving
finally he stops in frustration
he sits an a duct resting
just then the latch undoes itself
the hatchway slams open
edgar is showered with red lumpy fluid
he is coated with it
what the hell
edgar looks down
in the pool of red is a womans shoe
puzzled he bends down picks it up
something falls out of it is a severed human foot
as he reacts in shock the spinning turbine begins to splatter drops of blood on him
cynthia comes towards us
alan further down the hall sees her
cynthia turns reacts
and then reacts to
she goes into another corridor
alan hurries to catch up but then has to help a nurse with a frightened older woman
cynthia moves down the hall a bit
she looks up at the coiling
cynthia were up here
down the hall further another vent
come with us cynthia
you must join us cynthia
cynthia follows the voices
she is underneath another larger vent with a fan spinning inside
everyone in the hall ignores her
cynthia you must reach out and embrace our love for you
you must reach out to me
we see harris now behind the fan in brief flashes of light burnt then normal gazing down at cynthia
he reaches towards her
where are connie and ed
his fingers are sliced off by the fan
he takes no notice
theyre with us now
we hear splashing
cynthia looks over
gallons of blood and solid matter pour out of the ceiling vents all down the hall
where are they
she is frantic where are connie and ed
where are they
alan wonders at the pouring red then he hears cynthia screaming
he runs down the hall to stop her
the patients and nurses watch the blood pour in horror
cynthia is getting more and more hysterical
where are connie and ed
alan corners her
its all right its all right suddenly out of nowhere a bl d covered body careens into them driving them apart
its edgar covered with blood in a total state of shock
horrible sweet jesus help me alan struggles to restrain him
nurses run to help
huddles on the floor in a position not unlike the one from her coma
she sobs uncontrollably
alan and an orderly escort cynthia to her room
alan comes out watches edgar pass by in a wheelchair raving
ralph and gilda come up to alan
what the fuck is going on
its ed and connie
theyre dead arent they
alan looks at her
how did the grapevine got it to her so fast
were not sure what happened
there was evidence that they were drinking
they fell into
the main turbine
look ed drank before
lots of times
didnt know that did you
but he didnt usually decide to jump into a mix master man
ralph as for your own safety you are being given the most amount of protection possible
the police are powerless
softly harris wants us all
ralph looks at gilda with almost as much dismay as alan
jesus fucking christ
im getting the hell out of here
ralph storms out
as ralph moves along a paunchy policeman intercepts him
lieutenant wasserman assigned me to you
where you go
i get the picture
try not to shoot me or your fat ass okay
the newscast continues silently on the tv in her room
she is getting dressed
she peaks out the door
the policeman assigned to her is down the hall a ways chatting with a nurse
cynthia slips out and down the corridor
she waits for an elevator
when a door opens she tries to inconspicuously slip inside but she finds herself face to face with alan who in just getting out of the elevator
he holds a grocery bag
isnt this a coincidence
im getting out of here
he takes her arm and starts leading her back to her room
believe it or not this is the safest place for you to be
the police are here
there are doctors here
and im going to keep you company all night
i even brought provisions
he shows a variety of fast food
pure unadulterated junk
at this point who cares about the chemicals
she smiles slightly
he holds his arm out for her like a swain escorting his date
she takes it in a similar spirit
the policeman comes out of cynthias room looking for her in alarm
hes instantly relieved to see her there with alan
alan directs her inside
alan gives the policeman a look
try harder next time
he goes into her room leaving the embarrassed cop behind
suddenly the lights return with an eye jarring flash
the cop has his revolver halfway out of the holster before he realizes what it is
they both react to the returned power with relief
alan takes the stuff out of the bag chips dips cookies six packs of beer
he offers some of the chips
she shakes her head
the tvs still on
alan switches channels with the sound muted
with frightening casualness connie and ed arent going to be the last
yes they are
everyones under protection
nothing can happen
an outstretched hand slams itself down the blade impaling through the palm
the hand squirms its fingers a bit then pulls off
he gets up clenching the perforated hand
he is very calm
he closes the knife and puts it in a drawer
suddenly violently he kicks a trash bin
then he is calm again
ralphs assigned policeman pokes his head in the door
ralph sticks his hand behind him
he is very friendly very normal
yes thank you officer
hey lemme buy you a cup of coffee
shrugging sounds good to me
ralph comes out of his room
ralphs policeman is beside him
his hand bleeds but goes unnoticed
alan lies back in front of the tv eyes closed snoring
sympathetic cynthia slips the remote control from his hand
then there is a knock at the door
she goes there finds ralph who steps inside
to his cop just a sec
what is it
i just came to tell you smiling conspiratorially everythings gonna be okay
whats going to be okay
he goes into the bathroom and rinses his blood soaked hand
cynthia sees this
what happened to your hand
everythings gonna be okay
cynthia is mystified
ralph walks off his policeman following
yelling down the hall ralph
she comes in and pokes alan awake
ralph was just here
his hand was
they go to the door and they are immediately faced with hettie
goldman have you seen ralph
i was going to ask you the same thing
she holds up a paper cup with a tablet in it
he didnt take his four oclock
if he misses this one im gonna
alan takes the capsule examines it
its his tranquilizer
if he doesnt take this hell completely flip out
alan and cynthia run down the hall
cynthias policeman follows
alan and cynthia and the policeman scan for ralph
every five or six feet along in a line there is a moderately sized droplet splatter of blood
they follow the droplets along the hallway
they follow the droplets through a set of double doors
ralph walks along his policeman trailing
no one else is around
are you sure you know where youre going
ralph stops suddenly and turns to him
ralph smiles warmly
suddenly he hits the cop in the head using two fists
the cop falls
alan and cynthias policeman move down the hall following the drops scanning in doorways
cynthia is just behind them
these hallways are unused
was he behaving strangely
no more strangely than everybody also in this place
with walkie talkie i cant get him
he must be shut off
they pass an open freight elevator
cynthia looks in it and stops
there is a droplet of blood on the floor inside
a bloody hand reaches out of the elevator covering her mouth and pulls her inside
ralph holds her slams the gate closed and flips the switch
the car moves down
alan and the policeman rush up just as the car disappears
she wipes blood from her face
he looks wired
ralph we have to go and get your medication
she slowly moves to the control panel
he watches her
just as she is about to reach the buttons he violently pushes her back
the elevator comes down to a stop
ralph throws the door open
it is a huge dark space a vast store room
cynthia wont come out
ralph gestures politely
ralph im not going out
we have to go back upstairs
ralph grabs her firmly and pulls her out
i have to talk to you
he leans in the elevator opens the control panel and yanks some wires
the hum of the elevator motor dies
cynthia is panicked
its very very very very very important that i talk to you
ralph youre not being yourself
cant you tell
this is the real me
he flies across the basement and grabbing a chair smashes the control box for the electric cargo door the only other entrance
he darts up a storage aisle
he rips a phone off the wall
i come down here a lot
it helps me unwind
cynthia cant see him
he wildly paces up and down the storage aisles
cynthia starts to cry
how do we get out
its been said by better men than me in better ways in better times there is no way out
she goes to a barred window
ralph goes into a rage
he pushes over a huge storage shelf
everything spills and breaks
amid the rubble a pile of surgical blades lies glinting in a pool of light
ralph looks down at it
cynthia sees him looking at it
she is afraid
he grabs some of the blades randomly and disappears
he is walking crazily up and down the storage aisles
cynthia only catches glimpses of him
he jumps up and breaks the individual light bulbs which hang on wires providing the only illumination
the space grows darker
all the while ralph talks and talks
there are only a few chances for real glory and most people fuck it up
most people cant even find the noses on their fucking faces
jump break you want an example
how about every fucking doctor in this entire hospital
do you think im just going to let myself slowly dissolve into nothingness here
jump break im talking about a glorious glory
and everybodys trying to drag me down
ralph please they said you have to take some pills
pills have got nothing to do with it
you know what im talking about
he jumps smashes the last bulb
she cant see him
no i dont
real glory hallelujah
the great big gig in the sky
dont play dumb cynthia
she sees him at the far and of the aisle
his shirt is off
there are deep bleeding cuts all over his chest and stomach
he has blades clenched in both fists
cynthia is terrified
i think you know the word im searching for
he starts making deep slashes on his arm
u n i t y
oh god ralph
yes oh yes
he stops and raises the scalpels to his chest
he jabs them in and cuts open down to his stomach
ralph please stop
he swats at the one remaining lamp
it flickers on and off
ralphs eyes flutter
cynthia rushes to him
he throws a scalpel at her
it misses but she is spattered with blood
fading get back
cynthia is crouched down crying as she watches him
join us cynthia
the light flickers off then on
a hand is on cynthias shoulder
she looks up
it is harris
the bulb dies
wasserman rushes in raincoat over a pajama shirt and chino slacks
another policeman rushes to meet him
theyre in the basement
the girls alive
they run on together
lots of cops a few doctors and orderlies
alan is stopped by a female cop
he looks into the basement area and sees ralph in a pool of blood
a police photographer is taking pictures of him
alan stares at ralph
berrisford is with cynthia and a nurse
cynthia is getting an injection
wasserman comes over to alan and berrisford
youre running out of patients doctors
what did she say happened
shes having a little trouble with reality as usual
a nurse and an orderly escorts cynthia towards the elevator
to alan goodbye alan
thanks for trying
but its time for me to go now
alan suddenly realizes what she means
i have to go with her
where is she being taken
are you out of your mind
that girl needs human contact connection isolation is the worst thing you can do dr
goldman i know youre fond of the girl but youre out of line
you want her on the edge dont you
you want to play your theory out to the end goldman
anything i should know
its an extraordinarily complex situation severe identity crisis compounded with the multiple shock of these deaths
shes reverting to this total belief system from the commune through an intermittent psychosis that puts ideology above her life itself fuck ideology
fuck you berrisford
you cant use a human being as a guinea pig to wasserman you have to stop this
call it off ill ill sign her into police custody if i can stay on as her physician
i believe your tenure with my clinic has just come to an end
calling off security
would you please escort dr
goldman off the premises
cynthia is escorted through the hospital by the nurse and policeman
she moves without resistance without emotion
we hear crickets
cynthia hovers in a dreamlike calm
the hospital is a blur as they move through it
objects pass in front of our view as we track with her
cynthia the nurse and the policeman walk up the path to the imposing facade of the old victorian with its warmly lit windows looks inviting
the three make their way over the lawn up the path towards the front porch
an evening breeze is just coming up
cynthia looks around absorbing the environment
the policeman and the nurse say nothing
cynthia turns to them
would you like to come in
no thank you
cynthia steps inside
the door is closed
it is dark
a video camera hovers above
we hear keys l cking a bolt
cynthia stand there
its time cynthia
the nurse puts her keys in her pocket looks at the policeman and goes
the policeman stays
furious carrying a carton of personal items alan storms towards the exit
the security guard rises to intercept him
excuse me dr
apologetic im going to have to ask you for your key card
burning alan shifts his package finds the card flings it down on the counter
tell berrisford he can use it for a bookmark
maybe then he can find his dick without a road map
were gonna miss you around here dr
alan manages a smile for the man goes out
focus down until we realize it is cynthia lying in her bed
we are looking at her from directly above
we widen realize that were at a nurses station where cynthia is monitored along with other patients
we can see that she is talking
the only illumination comes from a small lamp near cynthias bed
she seems comparatively alert
you were always the favorite
we love you
come with us
all of us together thats all weve ever wanted isnt it
why are you doing it to everybody else
why dont you kill me
his index finger is aflame
why dont you kill me
we see the whole room now
its filled with unity house members all of them
theyre sitting leaning slumping everywhere in the shadows
among them are connie and ed
you have to do it yourself honey
when you didnt
he took us instead
but were not mad
its wonderful here
death is like this really beautiful trip cynthia
we just want to share it with you
lana and miriam
you mustnt be afraid cynthia
harris in playing with his burning finger
if i can do it you can do it honey
why dont you kill me
a nurse notices cynthias movement on the screen
she turns the volume up
why dont you just kill me
the nurse gets up
gilda is standing there
gildas policeman lurks nearby
you have to join us because you love us
you have to do it for yourself
we hear the nurse unlocking the door
a male unity member looks over at the door
we seem him momentarily burned
you have to do it for yourself smiling lovechild
we see harris momentarily burned
he blows his finger out
but im so scared
the nurse opens the door
the room is empty except for cynthia on her bed
you want me to call the doctor honey
cynthia says nothing
try to sleep all right
gilda rushes in behind the nurse going to cynthia
hey get out of here
frantic i can do nothing for you now but know this the answer you seek is inside of you
it is inside you
gildas policeman comes in
get her out of here
he pulls at gilda
as she goes know yourself and you will be at peace
it is so
the nurse slams the door closed
cynthia is alone
gildas policeman is on the phone
yeah im taking her back to her room
he hangs up looks around
gilda is gone
we are following gilda through the corridors back to her room
gildas policeman is still looking for her
shes nowhere in sight
gilda comes in and lies down
a shaft of light hits gilda as someone comes in the door
whoever it is nears gilda
she is calm
she looks over
i know youd come
but youre too late
she holds up a bottle of tablets
we fleetingly see the word poisonous
the bottle smashes to the floor
she looks like shes been crying
she stares off into space
someone crosses in the shadows to the window
the rubber edging is slit with a scalpel
it feels good
i know this is right
you need our love
we need your love
a shadowed hand pushes on the plexiglass
the windowpane plops onto the pavement below
a breeze wafts in
cynthia gets out of bed and comes to the window
she looks out onto the evening horizon refreshed fully experiencing the moment
i know this is right
well all be together
alan comes out still fuming
he walks along a ways and then looks at the illuminated sign pointing out the way to the berrisford clinic
alan stares at it then in a sudden release of fury kicks it once twice and then he throws his carton at it
calming feeling like an idiot he sighs
do we feel better now
a thought strikes him
he reaches into his shirt pocket takes out the one hettie handed to alan two long and bloody hours ago
with a shrug its okay officer
ill write myself a prescription in the morning
he swallows it dry with a loud gulp then he picks up his papers and things heads for the parking lot
pullback as alan unlocks it his carton momentarily balanced on the car roof
the door open alan gets in puts his box in the cluttered back seat
he shivers from one of those unexpected chills we all get then puts the key in the ignition starts the engine turns on the lights
then he looks up ahead and sees
briefcase in hand crossing the parking lot up ahead his long shadow falling across a high retaining wall
alan sits face unreadable
he revs the engine
a strange smile crosses alans face
he throws the car into he taken out his keys approaches his car
suddenly reacts as headlights blind him alan roars towards him grinning behind the wheel berrisford gasps runs
berrisford dodges in and out of cars behind lamp posts
manic alan follows him relentlessly skidding around turns sideswiping as many cars as budget allows
finally finds himself against a wall as tires skid in he screams he slams berrisford against the wall
berrisfords body smacks against the bricks rebounds onto the windshield alan recoils from the impact blood on his lips from his own collision with the steering wheel
he looks at berrisford squirming a foot away with the little life left in him
alan cackles gives berrisford the finger
then he throws the car into reverse
slides off the car hood hits the asphalt his head cracking as the car grinds him into the ground his wrist bones snapping ribs crunching body twitching
finally he is still
an artery squirts fountain like into the air
the blood hits the windshield
idly distracted alan turns on the windshield wipers
suddenly harris sits up in the rear seat a smile on the burned and scarred face
good work dr
now its your turn
skeletal hands grab alans throat
kicks out of the corner of his eye he sees gasoline is flowing over the dented hood and through the cracked windshield and over the dash and over alan
more and more comes
holding alan with one hand harris leans forward pulls out the cigarette lighter
he holds the glowing tip up in the air
need a light
he presses the burning tip against alans gasoline soaked creek
it sizzles alan screams
it explodes he jerks his head up face drenched in sweat
hes still in his original parking space
hes never even started the car
gasping for air still freaked he opens the door tumbles out
the box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car
alan sees this staggers against the car fights a wave of nausea
struggling to remain composed he takes his pulse
feels his head
suspicion crosses his face
then his hand moves to his shirt pocket
of himself taking the pill by the clinic sign
fingers down his throat
he heaves his guts out beside his car
but when he straightens up hes clear eyed and lucid
he turns runs like hell towards the clinic
ron the pharmacist looks up as alan storms inside
goldman you look like shit pushing him aside show me the scrips for the therapy group come on man i cant do that its berrisfords show all the way ignoring
him alan finds the files
shit this is all standard stuff
what do you expect
do you fill these prescriptions
nah berrisford does it
he comes in every morning and sets up the medication for the day hettie takes it as she needs it fuck
he turns tries to open the glass case with the prearranged trays
he grabs a paperweight smashes the hey
alan pulls out the tray scans it
he grabs ron by the collar shoves the files into his face
pesco ralph hes dead read it
whats he down for
ah lithium four times a day alan grabs the tray holds up a pill
is that lithium
fuck no thats endoral the complete opposite one of those even a normal person would flip out tell me about it
alan looks at the tray and its compartments labeled for lana miriam ed
all the others
alan grabs them all
this is uh dextroamphetamine
christ take one of these and you can walk on the ceiling
dont mass with that fucker
shit i didnt know they still made that
two of these and mother teresa would turn into a maniac
alan in having convulsions of horror
they swallow medication
he pulls bottles off the pharmacy shelves
they swallow medication
he hands the bottles of medication to the pharmacy administrator
alan grabs it away
he injects cynthia with medication
do you know what that is
liquid condensed marijuana
just thinking about that stuff gets you wasted
alan runs out
hey goldman come back here
whos gonna clean up this mess
alan running faster
hettie is standing smiling in the middle of the hall
youre not supposed to be here dr
goldman are you
two security guards are coming
please hettie i need your help
she is at the window facing out
alan rushes over to cynthias door and pounds furiously
the two security guards start running over
one of them has his gun drawn
alan wants to run but he sees there is no way out
he sticks his hands in the air
the guards are upon him
they start leading him away
sometimes doctors got personally involved
i think its a mistake
youve got to keep professional
get some rest goldman
you look like shit
he looks back at hettie
he sees a fire alarm
suddenly he grabs one of the guards guns
he dives against the wall and pulls the fire alarm
all of the isolation ward doors open
bells and sirens go off
red lights flash on and off
alan runs from the guards shooting but missing
he runs up the hall in the opposite direction of cynthias room
he hides in a doorway
he heads back up to cynthias room
he grabs the cops chair and runs into he slams the door and rams the metal chair log into the bolt latch to secure the door
sirens and bells continue
alan looks over
the room is dark except for the red light flashing on and off
cynthia is crouched in the far corner by the open window
we can see that the room is otherwise empty of anybody
get out of here
i want to do it
going to her no
im not going to be able to come back but you have to listen
berrisfords been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group thats why theyve been committing suicide hes been making them crazy but harris comes to me
he speaks to me
a drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible
all weve hearing for days is harris harris
so thats what we all saw
thats what i saw when i took ralphs pill
its all part of berrisfords plan he has this fucked up theory about how you still think youre part of the unity house and the only way he can prove
it is if you want to kill yourself
behind alan the dark shape of berrisford emerges from outside the window
it is climbing inside from the ledge
do you hear me
hes going to want you to kill yourself
hes recreating the whole thing for you
but you cant listen to him
cynthia is getting hysterical
berrisford stands behind alan with a scalpel
alan turns around
berrisford bashes him in the head neatly slicing off some skin
alan flies against the wall
the gun is knocked away
alan writhes a little then dips into unconsciousness cynthia is a basket case
she looks at alan
berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection
she calms herself
she looks at him dreamily
she sees harris gazing at her lovingly
only one thing matters
she touches his face
well be together
all of us
berrisford taken alans gun
alan comes to
the alarms and bells are still ringing
cynthia and berrisford are gone
the corridors are run amuck with isolation patients the worst kind all escaped from their rooms
alan runs out of cynthias room
he is surrounded by bizarre looking people screaming singing dancing praying
hettie is by the stairway helping isolation patients exit
one at a time
please do not use the elevator
alan is frantically looking for cynthia and berrisford checking everywhere pushing open doors
the security guards are at the far end of the hallway
alan goes to hettie
this is your fault
these goddamn doors wont re lock
furious where is he
hes going to kill cynthia
tell me where he is
i havent seen him
the guards see alan
they come after him
alan scans every room
he slams into patients
the guards arent far behind
alan turns a corner passing a door marked not an exit roof access
it is ajar
he goes in without the guards seeing him
it is dark but the red lights flash
he runs up several flights
the landings face onto the outside with a railing open no glass
he turns a corner
cynthia is there
she in perched on the outside of the railing a serene expression on her face the wind blowing her frail white gown
he moves towards her slowly hands outstretched
soothingly cynthia take my hand
think about what youre doing
i want you to take my hand
she watches him blankly
she turns to someone behind alan
its so beautiful
there on the stair above is berrisford his face dancing in the flashing red light
to berrisford you piece of shit
cynthia lets go
alan reaches out
it is a dizzying spiral
we hear the wind rushing up as we go faster and faster down
we slam into the ground
cynthias head hits rock
she is still
blood drips out her nose and mouth
she is dead
we hold on her until gradually bright light pours in over her
the camera lifts up revealing cynthia rises and walks towards the house through a field in the foreground
she walks up the porch
she opens the door
everything is clean and fresh
harris is at the far and of the hall
there is an intense white light behind him
he is smiling beatifically
cynthia goes towards him
as she nears him she reaches out her hands
he does too
suddenly she falls
she drops and dangles in the night air against she is unconscious
she swings twelve stories above the pavement
the camera follows up her arm to her hand grasped tightly by alans hand
we continue up to alan
open your eyes
open your eyes
he is over the railing holding on with his other hand
cynthia is coming to
pull yourself up so i can got a grip on you
let me go
let me go
i saw it
you didnt see shit
i want to go
let me go
coming forward let her go
she needs it
cynthia harris doesnt exist
look at who that is
look at him
cynthia looks at berrisford deliriously
he changes from berrisford to harris with each flash
he comes to the railing where alan is holding on
almost politely he tries to undo alans grip
alans grip on cynthia slips down to her fingers
let her go
let her go and ill forget your disobedience
you can stay one with me in the psychosis and cult behavior study
well publish our findings together publish this asshole
alan swings one leg up kicks berrisford in the groin
berrisford howls and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks
snarling like an animal he stomps claws and even bites at alans hand
to cynthia dont you hear him
hes trying to bribe me but im not letting go
ill go with you but im not letting go
berrisford sees the discarded gun
picks it up
he aims unsteadily
alan yanks himself out of the way
berrisford moves closer
raises the g barrel at point black range towards alans hand
cynthia help us
help us both
youll be with them dr
goldman be happy
one of alans finger joints is blown away
he screams his grip loosens and he slides down the railing
berrisford moves several yards to stay close
begins to pound on alans mutilated hand
cynthia dont let him kill you
dont let him do this
its my destiny
ive fought it too long
right or wrong
my death has a purpose
it will close the book
end the story
your life has a purpose
to bring joy and happiness
youre part of my life now
thats an unfinished story too
she looks at berrisford viciously pounding on alans hand
let me up
she starts to climb up but she cant
let me up
im afraid its too late for that
alans grip on her slips down to two fingers
she yells from the pain
she swings in the breeze
alan is weakening
he is losing consciousness
he knows he is about to die
suddenly berrisford freezes
he is paralyzed at the sight of one of the guards coming up the stairs
berrisford backs away glaring
the guard rushes over
jesus yelling down the stairs gomez get up here
the other guard appears
they start helping alan up by pulling his arm
as they help him up berrisford in a state of shock backs further up the wall
he leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head
he pulls the trigger
click click click
out of bullets
the others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing
just as they pull cynthia to the edge she looks up to see
berrisford coming to the railing and jumping calmly
cynthia numbly watches him fall
then she in pulled up and over
cynthia is plopped over onto a gurney
lights are passing her
she is being whisked down a hallway
she is descending into a haze of unconsciousness
i need a detox prep
it was him
alan runs alongside the gurney with doctors and nurses
he clutches bloody bandages to his hand tries to hear cynthia
it was berrisford
he killed them
then all those other things
in my head
it was berrisford
he shot you up with hallucinogens
what he didnt do you imagined
there is joy through her delirium
she is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors
a new station wagon whisks along the pretty road
alan drives cynthia looks at a map
they both look relaxed
they both have bandaged hands
go right if thats the interstate
yeah it is
through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of unity house
a chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it
alan and cynthia pull up park
cynthia gets out and looks around
she goes to the front entrance
alan follows her in
a mere skeleton of what it was
daylight pours in through the faded burnt slats of wood
patches of woods have sprouted up
cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all
only piles of charcoal signify where furniture was
alan meanders in from the other and of the house
looks like it was a nice house once
i guess appearances can be deceiving
she moves out upstairs
he follows her up onto the risky looking steps
she reaches a point at the top that looks out over the meadow and pond
she looks out
alan joins her
cynthia takes in the view contentedly
its really dead
she gestures to the house around them
he pulls her close to him
they look into each others eyes
neither of them is completely at ease with the other but there is honest affection
they hug then kiss
it looks almost tranquil
wasserman walks along accompanied by a uniformed officer
they go into where the doctor is in a bed one leg and one arm in traction
hes talking to his lawyer as the police officers enter
in mid speech letters of support could have an influence on the court
you know from your peers
cutting him off i have no peers
turning hello lieutenant
smiling forgive me for not getting up
real funny doctor
try this for laughs as soon as youre ambulatory youre going in front of a grand jury and youre going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice
and two counts of assault
then it gets choice five counts of murder in the first degree one count of murder in the second degree
add the civil liability to all that and youre going to have plenty of time to write that book
i dont agree with your definition of justice but i suppose i obstructed it
all in the name of science of course appalled doctor berrisford hushing him but as to murder well lieutenant i beg to differ
i didnt kill anyone
why would i
im only interested in knowledge
cynthia is a unique girl the product of an environment and a philosophy unrivaled in its purity
i wanted to understand the depth of her commitment the link between psychosis and total immersion philosophies the dark terra incognita of the human psyche fed up hey go chow
on a latin dictionary okay
you can bullshit all you want but how do you account for six bodies
clearly some unknown variable was a factor
well if you didnt kill off the therapy group who did
lieutenant ill put it in terms even a policeman can understand
he smiles shrugs the best he can in his plaster cast
it beats the fuck out of me
cynthia and alan are still in each others arms
cynthia pulls away
whats the matter
i was just thinking about gilda
somehow she knew
she kept talking about him but i didnt know what she meant
she said the answer was inside me
why would she say that
alan doesnt have an answer
you go down
ill be out in a minute
i just want to
bury some memories
cynthia gives a final look around at the deteriorated structure and turns down the stairs
she stands at the top of what remains of the stairs
we follow her down
just as she nears the bottom the ticking of a clock is audible
it gets louder
cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into
we follow her with a continuous pan
the foyer is new now completely untouched by fire just as it was at the beginning of the film
a candelabrum is lit
cynthia turns and we pan back to the staircase
it is new unburnt
two kids come scrambling down the stairs laughing
the entranceway the archway to the front room the staircase are all intact just as we saw them in the opening scene
cynthia peers into the kitchen
two women in work aprons are kneading bread dough chopping vegetables
they smile at cynthia
are you staying for supper
cynthia is silent wide eyed taking it all in
she turns towards the front door
victor is coming in
she in unable to resist
they walk in
the room is filled with people
there is a fire in the hearth
candles illuminate the space
unity members smile and great her casually as she passes them
miriam in talking with a bearded man intently
cynthia im so glad youre here
ed and connie are by the fireplace with some others
they smile at cynthia knowingly
lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children
ralph is crouched with victor in a corner
they are laughing warmly
gilda comes up to her
she is ebullient happier healthier looking than weve ever seen her
cynthia its so wonderful here but we miss you terribly
cynthia nears harris
he smiles at her and kisses her
everyone in the room turns to her
harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle
cynthia doesnt see it yet
he puts the pointed tip against her chest
its time cynthia
its finally time isnt it
fighting the vision you dont exist
i wouldnt say that
he touches her go on
take the knife
she cant escape his gaze
you know you want to
you know you do cynthia
youll see how beautiful it is
cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest harris lets go
she holds it there by herself completely hypnotized by his words by his eyes
cynthia were only telling you this because we love you
all will be in balance when youve joined us
all will be right when daughter is with father
youre special cynthia
daughter of the father
cynthia in mortified
now you remember
my own beautiful lovechild
everyone has proven their love to me
now you must
she is weak now
she is about to do it
her grasp tightens around the knife handle
she takes a deep breath
she jams the knife into harris throat and pulls it out
no i dont
i dont love you
i dont need you
she is crazed
she flies around the room brandishing the knife at everyone
they back off
i never loved any of you
i hate you
i hate you all
what you did was wrong
she swats the knife at them all
victors arm gets cut
gilda has to dive away from her
cynthia is knocking over lamps and chairs in her rage
she is crying hysterically
it was wrong
it was stupid
saddened oh cynthia
i never needed you
any of you
we are tight on cynthia
she is winding down crying with her face buried in her arms
i never did
she is still
gradually the silence fills with a quiet cynthia
she drops the knife
the knife is all rusty and corroded
the floor is a charred mass
cynthia turns around
alan comes in the front door
the room is again its empty skeletal self blackened and silent
cynthia is trembling
she walks out of the room
are you all right
she stands on the porch holding onto a post trying to calm herself
alan comes out
as he starts the car a gust comes up
the trees are thrashed around
the wind echoes through the house
cynthia descends the stairs
the station wagon pulls up
she gets inside
they pull out
slowly we see cynthia collect herself
a sense of hope is evident
its going to be okay
im going to be okay
the car speeds off trailing dust
we see the unity house in the distance
the winds kicks up again
we are closer
branches and leaves are being tossed around by violent gusts as we move toward the structure
a teenage girl comes running up from the field behind
she is crying
she runs into the house
we follow her
she goes to a far corner and cries some more angrily hopelessly
far off come on where are you
i hope youre not in that house
you always got like this and make stupid threats that you dont mean
the girl peeks out the corner of the window
the teenage boy is in the field beyond
if youre not here on three im history
the girl backs away from the window only more upset now
a hand touches her shoulder
she whirls around
startled who are you
what would you say if i could promise you eternal bliss
what do you mean
tracking in on the old knife an the floor
it begins to transform from its rusty and corroded state into a new and shiny knife
a burned skeletal hand reaches into frame and takes it
