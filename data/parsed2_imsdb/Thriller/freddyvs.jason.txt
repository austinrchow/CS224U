href b b nightmare freddy meets jason unproduced by lewis abernathy by lewis abernathy meagan is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion
her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze
the sound of children chanting increases
in chorus one
freddys coming for you
on you there is a rumble and a flash like quick lightning only evil
choice flashes from nightmare on elm street
meagan turns at
a beautiful white two story house thick with lush green foliage
several beautiful children all dressed in bright white play hopscotch and jumprope on the front walk
continuing chanting three
better lock your door
close on a little girls foot coming down on the number drawn on concrete
another rumble and flash longer louder
flashes from nightmare
meagan continues up the walk the wind is blowing a little harder now
the trees are brown the leaves peeling away
moving up the walk closer to the house
only now its a little darker needs some paint
on the front porch a little girl rides a tricycle
continuing chanting five
nightmare and freddys dead
continuing chanting grab your crucifix
the ix echoes away becoming the faint ka ka ka we all recognize as jasons theme
meagan turns to find that the children in the yard have vanished
the trees are dead the grass is gone and the horizon stretches off into utter nothingness
meagan turns back to the little girl
but the little girl has gone
only the tricycle remains
it circles once the front door creaks open and the empty tricycle peddles inside
meagan follows it into the
meagan enters the house slowly watching as the tri cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears
then the front door blows shut behind meagan
she tries to open it locked
then faint voices cause meagan to pause
she listens trying to make out the low murmur
then a little girls giggle
meagan recognizes it as her sisters
meagan moves up the stairs going down the hall
following the voices we recognize the other voice as belonging to freddy
meagan enters a door at the end of the hallway moving into
on the floor near her bed is meagans thirteen year old sister lizzy
slow for her age lizzy sits and draws with crayons
what are you doing here
playing with my friend
meagan looks at the drawings childlike renderings of freddy
he lives under the bed
meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under lizzys bed
suddenly a doll sized freddy scurries out from under the bed flashing past meagans face and running out the door
meagan yelps and touches her face five tiny slash marks on her cheek
continuing you scared him
meagan looks out the door incredulous
i scared him
but when meagan looks back lizzy is gone
lizzy echoes away as meagan finds herself standing in the
the tiny freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into a casket at the altar slamming the lid shut
meagan goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid
inside a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling all over it
meagan screams and slams the lid back down
the casket starts to move thump
then it stops
tentatively meagan opens the lid again
inside freddy krueger
he grabs her arm
where ya been all my death baby
freddy leaps out of the casket in a tuxedo crooning continuing ive been waitin at the altar for a long long time
meagan looks down shes wearing a wedding dress spattered with blood
behind her the chapel has filled with dozens of dead people in various stages of decay
a satanic priest appears in the pulpit and asks are the bridesmaids in attendance
meagan looks to her left four girls hold bouquets dressed in body bags
continuing and the groomsmen
freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest
continuing if anyone here believes that these two should not be joined in unholy matrimony let him speak now or forever rot in hell
from the back of the chapel a voice meagan
its her boyfriend jesse
he stands in the chapel doorway backlit by bright light arms outstretched
meagan runs to jesse and grabs him their arms encircling one another
she looks up into jesses eyes
only it isnt jesse
meagan screams as jason raises his machete bringing it down between her eyes
meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock buzzes
she was dreaming
she gets up quickly and crosses to her dresser
she looks into the mirror at the tiny cuts on her cheek and clucks
then she exits going into
meagan opens the door to her sisters room breathing a sigh of relief when she sees lizzy curled up in bed with a doll
meagan smiles and starts to exit when she notices something not quite right about the doll
she moves closer and pulls lizzys arm away to reveal a hideous little freddy doll
suddenly the doll opens its eyes and sneers well it aint raggedy ann bitch
the freddy doll flashes its tiny glove of knives thrusting them deep into meagans chest
meagans room morning for real meagan sits up suddenly in bed clutching her chest
she looks down and sees that there is nothing there
meagan sighs and falls back in her bed just a bad dream
her alarm clock buzzes
meagan sits up with a start again
her fright turns to rage as she pounds the alarm clock into submission
meagan climbs out of bed
meagan enters and finds lizzy still asleep clutching her raggedy ann doll
she gently pries the doll away tossing it disdainfully away
meagan picks up a small glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on lizzys head
wake up sleepy head
time to wake up
lizzys eyes flutter open
she smiles at her sister then frowns
i had a bad dream
i was scared
they cant hurt you
lizzy hugs meagan
continuing ill never let anyone hurt you
close on a small television set on the kitchen table
a flashy graphic flashes across the screen am news news reporter stands in front a police blockade
in the background dozens of police and s
men surround a small run down two story house
filtered as the sun rises on yet another morning still no end in sight for the standoff between police and the mysterious group known only as the freddy cult who
seized the abandoned house behind me just thirteen days ago
these cultists mostly run away teenagers have managed to keep police at bay for almost two weeks while inside they take mind altering narcotics in order to communicate with their
the reporter babbles on as meagan enters the kitchen where meagans mom is sitting watching the tv gulping down orange juice
across from mom is meagans dad who is having coffee reading the paper
meagan pours herself a cup and sits
meagans mom grunts transfixed on the news
dad looks over his paper long enough to smile and say just a little too cheerfully morning meagan
meagan looks over at her mother then back at her father mouthing the words hows mom
when suddenly meagans mom bellows calls upstairs lizzy
get down here
breakfast is almost ready
meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back into his paper
meagan sighs and sips her coffee
angle on tv a police booking photo of fred krueger
alleged child murderer fred krueger was released on a legal technicality but later burned to death at the hands of a vigilante mob of grieving parents
some years later a rash of bizarre and unexplainable teen age deaths began leaving many in the area to wonder
is freddy really dead
meagans younger sister lizzy comes down to breakfast
the microwave dings and meagans mom pulls out three pop tarts dealing them out to her family like playing cards
lizzy picks up her pop tart whining
hurry up and eat
you dont want to be late for special school
dont call it that
i hate that school
the other kids are mean
and theyre all re tard ed
we dont use that word
theyre special children just like youre special
dad looks over at mom who shoots him an angry look
dad takes a bite of his pop tart sinking back behind the paper
the cult members have declined to an on camera interview but did send out a note with a message
the note which by the way appears to have been written in blood reads
reads the note to the parents of springwood freddy lives
soon he will come and take one of your children as his virgin bride
then freddy will beep and his beep upon her beep and beep and behold a soulless child shall be born
the vessel for freddy to rise and rule the darkness forever and ever
a horn toots outside
lets go lizzy
meagan collects her books and her sister
this is dads cue to look at his watch and say oh look at the time
ive got to be going
anyone need me to bring anything home tonight
i need an alarm clock
whats wrong with your old one
meagan kisses her dad as she and lizzy hurry out the door
meagans dad looks over at his wife who says were almost out of vodka
meagan and lizzy climb into jesses car
hey whats the matter
i had another dream last night
was i naked
you were jason
then was i any good
meagan playfully smacks him as jesses car roars off
meagans dad hesitates at the front door clutching his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to say something
do you have to watch that crap all the time
months and months of the o
simpson trial and now this
mom reaches over and switches off the tv
dad smiles slightly and exits
mom waits until the door closes then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit into her orange juice
she takes a deep drink and switches the set back on
close on tv as the news reporter interviews captain renton murdoch state trooper
im standing here with state trooper captain renton murdoch the man the governor has called in to deal with the cultists because of his past experience with occult style murderers
in fact trooper murdoch is the only law enforcement officer ever to survive a one on one encounter with notorious camp crystal lake killer jason voorhees
to murdoch you received some pretty nasty injuries in your battle with jason didnt you captain
just a few stitches
what about these so called freddy cultists
they seem like pretty tough customers
think youll have any trouble getting them out of there
now that the governor has given me complete authority to deal with these punks i should be putting an end to their situation pretty quick
unless of course their attorney is able to get them to come out peace fully
but i dont hold out much hope for that
to camera captain renton murdoch ladies and gentlemen
a tough cop
for tough criminals
murdoch gets into the command car sitting down next to the s
commander sitting behind the wheel
oughtta be a law
gestures to house is that shyster still in there trying to talk them out
hes making them some kind of deal
what a bunch of assholes
shakespeare was right kill all the lawyers
then we could kill all the punks with no hassles and the world would be a safer place
what did shakespeare know
long haired english freak
he was probably a punk
meanwhile inside the house
the cults sleazy lawyer is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room
he is surrounded by cultists heavily armed teenage punks in red and olive sweaters and fedoras ala freddy
they stare out at him through sunglasses with red flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and disfigured faces
the lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held neatly on his lap
then he lifts his head wiping his nose nervously as he speaks so as i explained to you before the revenues between the tv movie deal and the book sale
should be adequate to fund your joint defense
and i think with my mass media hypnosis argument i could get each of you a reduced sentence on appeal say
twenty years each
out in fifteen with good behavior
the lawyers disembodied head comes sailing out of an upstairs window smacking into the command cars windshield with a loud splat
murdoch curses and leaps out of the car charging the house as he blasts away with two nickel plated s
suddenly gunfire erupts from every window in the house bullet hits riddling the cops cars smashing windows and emergency lights
team follows murdoch through the hail of gunfire as he kicks open the front door
the door flies open and murdoch and the s
team move in
the windows have been covered with foil the walls have been painted black with cult slogans written in red making the whole house black as pitch
team puts on their night vision goggles and starts moving through the house
through night vision goggles as the s
team goes through the house shooting cultists ala the computer game doom
then a blinding flash of light and a s
guy goes down shot in the face
several of the cultists lead the attacking s
team deeper into the house
as one of the s
guys follows his foot trips a wire
a trap door opens in the floor and the s
guy falls into a pit waist deep in water
suddenly the water starts churning and the guy starts screaming its a tank of piranhas
two other s
guys grab his arms and pull him out
too late his legs have been shredded to the bone
guy kicks in a door to a room and steps in firing his machine gun
a large scythe swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows
his arms fall to the floor still firing the machine gun
the cultists race into a room grabbing handrailing bolted over head
they swing like monkeys across the ceiling just as a s
guy charges into the room behind them
close on s
guys boots as he steps onto a floor covered with upturned nails
several nails puncture both boots the points coming up through the laces
guy screams and another s
guy barrels into the room to see what is wrong
he knocks the first guy face first into the floor o nails
meanwhile murdoch is having a blast literally
he kicks open the door to a room and guns down three cultists as they try to escape out a window
as the last body pitches to the floor murdoch yells freeze
murdoch exits laughing to himself
the running gunbattle continues as the cultists retreat to the back of the house throwing molotov cocktails
soon the first floor is ablaze
guy screams as he is consumed by fire
the cultists thunder down a back staircase to the
the cultists uncover a secret passageway under the house and most escape through the underground tunnel just before the s
team comes blasting into the basement
as the last of the remaining cultists is capped off a faint voice cries for help
commander raises up his hand
hold your fire
he pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his flashlight into the basement
through the dense smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied to a chair sitting on a crate
underneath the chair several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer
close help me mister
commander rushes to the girl kneeling down to look at the bomb
then he takes a leatherman tool from his vest and starts to work on the bombs timer
hang on honey
ill have you out of there in a second
murdoch comes down the stairs
he goes to the secret passageway and says looks like well have to hunt the rest of them down
lets go before they get too far
we cant leave
cant you see weve got a situation here
murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs
i cant just leave her
ive seen this before
theres nothing you can do
ive got to try
commander wipes his brow and leans in to work on the bomb again
close on timer
the basement ceiling is now fully ablaze and chunks of burning debris fall around the skittish s
murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion
youre wasting your time
commander studies the wires for another second then glances back at the timer
commander whips out his spyderco knife and cuts the little girl loose
he carries her out in his arms as he shouts to his men continuing yelling the s
team exits the basement with murdoch bringing up the rear
commander staggers out with the little girl followed closely with the remainder of his men and finally murdoch
the commander throws himself to the ground covering the little girl with his body as ba boom
the elm street house explodes
murdoch stands as debris rains down around him
he mutters punks
as the dust settles the s
commander rolls off the little girl and starts checking her for injury
are you okay honey
suddenly the little girl jumps onto the s
commander flashing a glove of knives
she hisses freddy lives
with a quick swing the little girl slashes the commanders face
she dives back for a plunge to his throat when murdoch walks up and kicks her off
he puts his boot on her holding her down as he takes aim on her head with his pistol execution style
commander grabs murdochs arm just in time
several cops rush in and grab the girl dragging her off kicking and screaming
you were going to kill that kid werent you
i told you you were wasting your time
once these kids go rabid best thing to do is put em down
you cant be serious
the world is made up of rules
kids dont like rules
they rebel for a while but ultimately they start to fall in line and become ordinary joes like you and me
but some kids
dope smokers mainly watching their mtv
satanic lyrics melting whats left of their brains
these kids grow up to be punks
and when these punks step as far over the line as these freddy punks have then we as peace officers have no choice but to kill them
i didnt become a peace officer to kill kids
theres a difference
under his breath barely
close on graffiti written across lockers freddy we move from this to a small classroom window
through it we see meagan sitting in economics class
the instructor miss krepps is lecturing
blah blah blah
several of the kids fan themselves struggling to stay awake while others have already passed out on their desks
meagans eyes are heavy
she looks over at jesse pretending to follow along in his book fast asleep
the antique oscillating fan on miss krepps desk clicks loudly as she drones on continuing blah blah blah
meagan starts to drift off when
continuing loud meagan
i asked if you were ready to give your oral report
please come up here to the podium
meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the snickers of some of her classmates
miss krepps snaps her fingers for quiet
continuing you wont think its funny when you havent learned the fundamentals of a free market economy
oh why do i waste my breath
youre all going to grow up to be gas station attendants and waitresses anyway
go ahead meagan
my report is on global economic trends
clears throat begins reading try and think of a world where there is no poverty
a world where everyone is happy to be alive and everyone lives together in peace
this is my dream
the fan on miss krepps desk starts to click louder blowing harder
meagan raises an eyebrow but continues with her report
continuing this dream is becoming a reality with ever growing international business
close on the fan as it changes
turning into a freddy fan
we cant hear you
meagan repeats the last few sentences raising her voice to be heard over the fan
then pages of her report start to blow away
she grabs at them as the wind increases
a bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and spills to the floor at meagans feet
she bends over to pick it up when her skirt blows up
she presses it down but the wind is too great and the skirt billows up revealing her underwear
the class roars with laughter
continuing louder meagan
we still cant hear you
but meagan isnt reading her report anymore shes busy trying to push down her skirt when rip
the wind blows her skirt off
her classmates fall over themselves laughing
meagans blouse blows away
she tries to hide behind the podium when that too is swept off
meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start to drift away thread by thread
she is almost naked
meagan looks up at her classmates red in the face
her classmates point and laugh only now they are all a bunch of old rotten skeletons
and up front in the center where miss krepps sat
he wears a beanie with a propeller points and laughs aww
all dressed up and nowhere to blow
meagan screams clutching at the last few tiny strands of cloth that cover her body
she calls to jesse pleading jesse
please help me
but jesse just sits at his desk dead
he reaches up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale expressionless face
looks like a photo opportunity to me
freddy pulls out an over sized camera with a gargantuan flashgun attached
the flash bulb is the size of a beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the front
freddy sizes meagan up in the viewfinder and sneers continuing say
the flash bulb goes off with an atomic light
meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back against the blackboard vaporized
meagan waking up in her seat suddenly
the classroom as normal
miss krepps is standing over her asking meagan
meagan looks around bewildered and confused
continuing i asked if you were ready to give your report
meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls herself together
meagan stands up and faints
v as the school nurse comes into focus standing over her
can you hear me
do you know where you are
meagan is laying on a couch a cloth over her head
i was day dreaming and then i woke up but then it was like i was still dreaming and then i woke up and then i guess i fainted and
now im awake again
are you sure
meagan stares at the nurse for a moment
im waiting to see if youre going to turn into freddy
youve been watching too much cnn
that crazy freddy cult thing its all over the tv day and night you cant get away from it
no wonder you kids are all having nightmares
but this one was different
it felt real
but thats just it meagan
dreams arent real
theyre just broken fragments of the subconscious mind
fear is real though isnt it
and if nightmares are fear then doesnt that make them real
gets excited and if the nightmares are real then is reality like a dream
cutting her off meagan
youve got heat prostration
the nurse slaps a wet towel over her face
jesse is waiting for meagan as she emerges from the nurses office muttering under her breath old witch
what does she know
she isnt even qualified to give a shot and shes telling me that my dreams arent anything to worry about
so she said you were okay
madame curie in there says its just a case of heat pro stration and an overdose of tv news
ruined my makeup too
so youre going back to class
she gave me last period off
well what are you bitching about
i could have a compound fracture of the skull and she wouldnt excuse me from p
ive been having nightmares for almost two weeks now and they keep getting worse
now im having daymares
i want to know why
well didnt the nurse say it was heat probation
meagan rolls her eyes in frustration
you dont understand
i want to know more about dreams
what they mean
why we have them
okay meg go look it up
youve got the rest of the day off thats all im saying
thats a good idea
why dont you cut last period and come with me
where are we going
you want me to cut school so we can go to the library
meagan pours through a big psychology book
across the table jesse peers into another psychology book
jesse looks up suddenly
over jesses shoulder we see he has a copy of road track tucked inside his psychology book
did you know that our sub conscious retains everything that ever happened to us
from the time were born until we die
thats how freddy gets at us
by using our sub conscious fears
fears our conscious minds have repressed or forgotten
ive got a news flash for you
im not so sure
if freddy exists in our sub conscious then he can never be fully erased
like a bad memory
you may blot it out of your mind but it will alway be hiding someplace in your dreams
off jesses disbelieving stare werent you scared as a child by something so stupid that youre ashamed to admit it
what is it
when i was kid my brother took me to the carnival
and in the penny arcade there was this robot gunslinger
you know about black bart
you put your quarter in and he says go ahead and draw tenderfoot
and then you pull your gun out and shoot him
thats just it i never could
id point the gun right at him and shoot and i could never hit the guy
so i always got killed
no one can hit him its a gyp
scared the shit out of me
meagan tries to hide her smile
continuing flustered isnt that scary
for a kid
somebody shushes her
continuing mad okay smartass
what about you
what scared you the most as a kid
a dark mood falls over meagan as her mind winds back
lizzy wandered off one day and we couldnt find her
the police came and everything
i wasnt really worried until i saw her picture on tv
then i got really scared
then jesse i cant explain it
but i think something bads going to happen
lizzy sits on the steps of her school clutching her books and raggedy ann doll
behind her wearing a protective helmet another learning disabled kid leonard taunts her
no you are
they forgot you again
no they didnt
yes they forgot and youre goin to wait out here until its dark and then the monsters are goin come and get you
no they wont because im walkin home
lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking
leonard calls after her come back lizzy
you can wait with me
i got forgot too you know
lizzy keeps going marching across the deserted school yard
leonard turns to go inside the school when he bumps into a passing cultist
the cultist pushes him down as he follows after lizzy
im going to have to report this
lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling shes being followed
she turns and sees a cultist standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her
lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she glances back the figure is still standing
scared lizzy turns and runs dropping her books as she flees down the sidewalk
as she comes to the street a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front of her the door swinging open wide
burned arms reach out to grab lizzy
the cultists grab lizzy pulling her into the car as it roars off down the street
close on raggedy ann laying in the gutter
jesses car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked in front of meagans house
meagan gets out of the car and rushes inside
cops are everywhere as meagan bursts into the house calling for her family
jesse enters behind her when meagans dad comes up asking didnt you get my message
i called the school after lunch
i had to stay late after work
meagans mother bellows from the living room where she is talking to a policeman taking notes
she is drunk and has been crying
dont you dare blame this on her you sorry bastard
its all your fault
to meagan where have you been anyway
a likely goddamn story
meagans mom breaks down sobbing
she didnt come home from school today
the police got a report that a girl fitting lizzys description was forced into a car by some crazies
theyre pretty sure it was this freddy cult
shocked oh my god
meagans dad puts his arm around meagan and tries to comfort her
now dont worry
the police are doing everything they can
meagan looks over and sees murdoch talking to his men when a voice from upstairs calls down hey capn
better have a look up here
as murdoch enters he spots lizzys night table and the small glass menagerie there
murdoch picks up the unicorn and admires it when a trooper draws his attention to the floor next to the bed
laying there are several childlike drawings of freddy including one that has freddy lives scrawled across the top
meagan enters and sees the drawings
looks like she was in the cult all along
no she wouldnt do that
lizzy wouldnt join freddys cult
i know its hard to believe miss
but a lot of good kids get caught up in this kind of trouble
murdoch stares at the drawings his jaw muscles tightening
he clenches his fist pulverizing the little unicorn
murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on the table as he exits the room brushing past meagan
meagans dad follows murdoch to the door asking captain murdoch
is there any thing we can do
you can pray sir
pray we find your daughter before
well before its too late
but rest assured if i cant persuade her to come back to her loving home then ill do whats best for her
i know you and your wife wouldnt want her to suffer
to his men come on
i want to go talk to erwin
murdoch and his men say good bye and quickly exit
as the last of the cops drive away meagan pulls jesse out of the house
where are we going
over to stormies
i thought you and her werent friends anymore since she stole that twenty dollars from you
that was her klepto phase
when she was dating that gang member
she dumped him a long time ago
i still dont understand
what has she got to do with lizzy missing
she used to be in the freddy cult
maybe she knows where they took lizzy
they exit to jesses car
meagans high strung best friend stormie is blurting out at a mile a minute if i did know i would call the police you know that
i love lizzy
no telling what those freaks will do to her
those freddy cult guys are hard core
i thought you were in the cult
i was in the cult for a week cause my boyfriend at the time
slasher he was
but i just liked the music and the clothes
when they were clean but not like the violence and stuff
but that was just my cult phase
but i got past that
you know just like my gang phase when i was dating ramon and then before that was my death rock phase when i was dating stuart
uh excuse me
but what phase are we in now
militant feminist man hating phase whats it fuckin to ya
to meagan why dont you just let the cops find her
that guy renton murdoch he knows how to deal with these cultist psychos
he was the man who got jason voorhees
that guy in my dreams
jason kicked his ass
jesse narrates a short fuzzy silent flashback as younger looking renton murdoch is blasting away at jason in panic
but murdoch put thirteen bullets in jason before he hacked his head open
jason cleaves murdochs head with a machete
murdoch staggers back raising his pistol
continuing but even with his head hacked open and his brains leaking out murdoch still managed to put his last bullet in jasons eye
murdoch fires the bullet smacking jason in the eye
thick blood runs down the hockey mask as murdochs body hits the ground
murdoch lays in a bed his head covered in bandages
tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of medical contraptions
well one of my moms boyfriends worked at the hospital where they took him
he said that murdoch lost more than half his brain and what little that was left was all twisted up inside
and they had to replace his skull with a metal plate to keep that from leaking out
in a series of quick cuts we move in close on murdochs eyes dark and menacing staring out at us
continuing they say he hasnt been the same since
so whats different about him
he used to be a democrat
now he votes straight republican
i think he thinks lizzy joined the cult or something
oh my god
hell kill her
ive got to find lizzy myself
ive got to find her and save her from freddy before that crazy cop kills her
just where are you going to look
i mean these cult guys could be holding her anywhere
murdoch said something about going to talk to somebody named erwin
he used to be in the freddy cult
i bet he knows where they took lizzy
not squirmin erwin that freak that used to eat bugs
annoyed who else
to meagan bright erwin is scary smart always brought home a s but he was kinda fucked up too
i mean who isnt really
anyway he quit the cult a few months back and the cops put him away for his own safety
they say freddys put a death hex on erwin
a death hex
yes a death hex
where someone wants you dead
where is he
jesse meagan and stormie pull past the large sign and into the parking lot
as jesse puts the car in park meagan turns to him and says i want you to stay here
dont be mad
its just that you might scare him
what shes subtly trying to tell you is that this needs a womans gentle touch
just stay here
jesse grudgingly agrees
meagan kisses jesse on the cheek
stormie sticks her tongue out at him then turns as she and meagan walk toward the main entrance
the cries of the insane echo through the building as the security guard escorts meagan and stormie down a row of cell doors
he stops at one tapping lightly on the glass
youve got a couple of visitors
now be a good boy
to meagan stormie youve got five minutes
ill be right down the hall if you need me
the guard exits
meagan and stormie peer through the thick window erwins padded cell appears vacant
they exchange anxious looks then meagan presses a little closer to the glass
erwin suddenly presses his horribly burned face to the glass as he screams meagan and stormie jump back startled
then they quickly bare their arms turning them over for erwins inspection
continuing where do you shoot
hes talking about dream dope the stuff the cultists shoot up with so they can talk to freddy
i dont do drugs
youre not in the cult
didnt freddy send you to kill me
i dont trust you
better take off your clothes so i can check you for tracks
were here for some hard data not a floppy disk
erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket gesturing to the inside of his cell empty except for a small mattress
well what do you want
cant you see im busy
freddys cult kidnapped my sister
i told her you might know where they took her
i already told the cops everything i know
im sorry about your sister but ive got my own problems with freddy
im a marked man you know
then tell me why they took her
to bear his child
freddy wants to be human again
in order to do that he has to be reborn
how can he do that
he has to marry a virgin on holy ground
then the cult consumate the marriage by impregnating her
the whole cult
freddys the son of a hundred maniacs
its sort of a tradition with him
so the cult gets lizzy pregnant
and freddy enters the soul of the fetus through a dream state
there is a moment as the girls take this in then thats the stupidest shit i ever heard
hey theyre not my rules
some body else wrote em
youve got to help me find lizzy
youre my only hope
erwin thinks about this for a second then ill help you find your sister but youve got to help me
just name it
you have to help me kill freddy
meagan and stormie exchange looks
but freddys dead
looks at meagan if only in our dreams
stormie grabs meagan by the arm and starts to pull her away
come on meagan
our five minutes is up
hes giving me the creeps
but meagan stays put and asks erwin how can you kill a dream
when its not a dream
then do we have a deal
erwin presses his palm against the glass
meagan thinks a moment then puts her hand against the glass over his
meagan jesse and stormie are standing in front of a pay phone arguing
i wont do it
come on jesse
i could go to jail
how will they ever know
dont be such a pussy
why dont you call then
okay i will
theyll never believe her
i can disguise my voice
lowers voice hello how do you do
my name is jesse
i think im a man but im actually a wimp
theyll never believe that
come on jesse
ill do it
to stormie and im not a wimp
jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth
after a moments hesitation jesse steps out and immediately both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make the call
jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both girls shut up he says continuing i need a quarter for the phone
meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him
jesse re enters the booth
angle in phone booth as jesse dials a number
the security guard picks up his phone as it rings
springwood mental center
how can i help you
filtered disguising his voice theres a bomb planted in your building
who is this
if i were you id get my ass out of there
in the background we hear meagan and stormie whisper something to jesse
continuing adding oh yeah
the guards eyes grow wide
the peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a fire alarm
soon all the inmates start filing out into the yard loosely herded by the guards
erwin files out with the others still wearing his straight jacket
erwin looks over at the parking lot jesses car flashes its lights
erwin starts to casually wander off towards the fence between himself and freedom when the security guard spots him and says hey erwin
where do you think youre going
erwin ignores him still moving towards the fence
continuing im talking to you asshole
erwin breaks into a run
the guard takes off after him
in the car jesse meagan and stormie watch as the guard closes the distance
hes not going to make it
weve got to do something
with grim determination jesse starts his car
jesses car tears out of the parking lot racing for the fence
with a loud metallic ching jesses car drives into the fence knocking that section down
erwin dances over the downed chain link diving into an open window
then with a squeal of tires and the rending of metal jesses car backs out of the fence does a and peels off
angle inside car as stormie and meagan help erwin out of his straight jacket
once freed erwin extends his hand to jesse
hi my names erwin
thanks for busting me out of there
jesse looks at erwins outstretched hand the fingertips are all heavily bandaged
look erwin just do me one favor dont eat nothing disgusting
my stomach is tight enough as it is
the security guard runs up to the fence huffing and puffing watching as jesses car disappears down the street
then he spots something in the fence and plucks it out
jesses front license plate
close on lizzy screaming and crying as the cultists close in around her
they rip her sleeve off and inject her with a syringe
after a moment lizzy starts to settle down
the cultists lift lizzy up over their heads and carry her towards the big boiler
inside a raging inferno
lizzys dream state p
as the cultists reach the boiler it splits open in the middle like a giant gate
the two halves swing open wide to reveal
a narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop a tall narrow mountain
on either side of the ledge is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below rivers of hot molten lava stretching out for miles filled with lost souls drowning and
hundreds upon hundreds of voices are screaming and moaning a terrible chorus of the damned
the cultists carry lizzy across the rocky ledge to the mausoleum
the outside of this ancient structure is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of mankind
in the center a large iron gate that swings open as the cultists near
the cultists roll lizzy over in their arms holding her tight as they push her face forward into the mirror
the glass gives way like mercury lizzys face disappearing into the mirror
angle on the other side underwater lizzys face stares out into utter blackness
then some thing large and evil looking swims up out of the darkness
clawed hands reach out and grab lizzy by the sides of the face as the huge monstrous head moves forward evil lips parting tongue slithering out
the evil thing gives lizzy a big wet french kiss locking its lips over hers
several slippery some things slither into her mouth
lizzy struggles but the big evil thing is way too strong
finally it releases her and the cultists pull her back out
the cultists carry lizzy out of hell and back into the
horribly burned hands slap lizzy back from her semi conscious state
her eyes grow wide with fear again as she opens her mouth to scream
suddenly she doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a cultist thrusts under her
three evil looking eels slither forth from lizzys mouth the dream demons
several shadows flee into the night as jesses car pulls up next to a run down building
erwin leads meagan jesse and stormie down into the old burnt out boiler room
they work their way towards the back to a large table and a collection of sofas and easy chair scattered about
erwin starts sniffing around pointing out several used syringes laying scattered about the floor
we must have just missed them
meagan spots lizzys shirt sleeve on the floor
oh my god she was here
this is part of lizzys shirt
its all torn
grabs erwin erwin
weve got to find her
were too late
theres no way
we could go after freddy
erwin goes to a boiler bends down and reaches way up underneath
after fishing around for a moment he draws out a well worn mutant ninja turtles lunch box
inside a vile of liquid several syringes and several pairs of cult shades
well inject ourselves with dream dope
its a mild narcotic that brings on a dreamlike state
meagan thinks about this for a moment then nods her approval
lets do it
we dont do drugs
i mean what if one of us gets hooked or something
whispers we could turn out like him
jesse jerks a thumb toward erwin
dont worry about it
we need you wide awake anyway
were going to go under and try to find freddy
when we do well grab him and bring him here
then you kill him with this
erwin hands jesse an old rusty revolver
this rusty chunk of shit
what good is this
its not the gun its whats in it silver bullets blessed by a priest
will that work
finishes for him you dont make the rules
what should we do
have a seat over there and make yourselves comfortable
roll up your sleeves and put these on
erwin hands meagan and stormie each a pair of the sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens
stormie puts hers on immediately and says oh cool
what are they for
its how the cult keeps in constant contact with freddy
the little lights flashing are a sustained occular input that causes your brain to resonate at approximately the same frequency at which the dream state is most likely to occur
all of this went over meagans head
stormie shrugs whatever
to meagan excited put em on theyre really cool
meagan and stormie sit down in easy chairs rolling up their sleeves
erwin comes over and reclines the chairs giving each girl an injection
then erwin takes a seat next to meagan and injects himself
he lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his glasses
it helps to hold hands if you want to go together
meagan clasps hands with erwin and stormie
jesse watches with skepticism and concern
erwin ushers a final warning continuing and remember
freddy knows what scares you
then all three fall through their chairs into
meagan stormie and erwin falling through dreamspace fantastic digital effect tunnel still holding hands
the girls scream as erwin smiles and yells jesse watches over meagan stormie and erwin all asleep in their chairs
meagan stormie and erwin fall into a crazy night mare boiler room visually reminiscent of the freddy pictures with rusty catwalks huge out of proportion fixtures above and a sea
of boiling water below
as they get to their feet meagan hears lizzys voice distant meagan
meagan enters a shaft following the sound when suddenly the shaft closes up behind her
stormie and erwin try to find the opening again but cant
freddys trying to split us up
jesse is standing in front of an old full length mirror practicing drawing the pistol
he pulls it and pretends to fire blowing imaginary smoke from the muzzle as he says okay freddy
theres a new sheriff in dreamland now
stormie and erwin make their way through the creepy boiler room calling for meagan
a strange shadow stalks them its freddy
he drops down in front of erwin and stormie
looking for some body
freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of lost souls
in the center meagan
stormie charges freddy throwing her arms around him as she screams to erwin ive got him
wake us up
wake us up
but erwin is paralyzed with fear
continuing dont just stand there
wake us up
i feel like seafood tonight
suddenly stormies arms have become huge lobster claws
she jerks away from freddy but too late stormie starts to change into a giant lobster woman
freddy smiles now hes wearing a chefs hat and apron
continuing stew on this bitch
freddy knocks the lobster woman over the side
she falls into the boiling water far below ker splash
stormie wakes with a start yelling shoot him
jesse spins aiming the pistol
but nothing is there
freddy turns toward erwin
well well well
if it isnt my ol pal erwin
erwin stares wide eyed frozen to the spot
continuing ive got something special in mind for you
suddenly erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls out a pin
freddy gawks surprised
erwin pricks his finger
erwin wakes with a start
stormie smacks him
you didnt help me you pussy
i couldve had him
smacks him some more you gutless
jesse looks over to where meagan is still sleeping
meagan comes down the sidewalk still following lizzys voice
it leads her to her house
meagan enters the front door
meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen table reading his paper
the headline reads daddy
he looks up and quietly shushes her
im trying to be invisible
and with that meagans dad disappears
only the newspaper remains
then meagan hears lizzys voice again
as she comes down the upstairs hallway meagan passes her mothers room
the door is open a crack
meagan looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle to her lips
the bottle sucks the life out of meagans mom who shrivels up into an ugly ol prune face
meagan starts to help her mother when lizzys cry for help draws her to
she sees lizzy on her bed under the covers
meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that lizzy is pregnant her naked swollen stomach protruding from her night gown
something inside is trying to push its way out
meagan moves to help her sister when freddys glove bursts out of lizzys stomach stabbing meagan in the chest
meagan wakes up suddenly
she looks up at stormie erwin and jesse standing over her
are you okay
they help meagan to her feet
shaky he got away
i had him and he got away
i lost her
well atleast youre not dead
im not dead
but freddy killed me
he killed me too
stormie raises her shirt up to show meagan she is unharmed
erwin sneaks a look and stormie smacks him
meagan gets to her feet asking now that i think about it hes killed me in all my nightmares
but im not dead
what does it mean
it means weve still got some time left
until his remains are host to the dream demons freddy cant hurt us
the dream demons
freddy made a pact with satan when he died
so satan bestowed upon him the dream demons
theyre the source of freddys power to manipulate our physical reality
hes powerless nothing more than a bad dream
off jesses cynical look hey like i said
i dont make the rules
but weve still got a chance right
a chance to kill freddy before he gets back his power
we already tried that
theres no way for us to kill freddy
hes too clever
he knows how to get to us
then lets get somebody else
some body strong
we could hire somebody to kill freddy like a hit man
you would have to hire a thousand of them
or one really big guy who isnt afraid of anything
then you got a shot
where are you going to find a hit man
the yellow pages
in your dreams
jesses last three words strike meagan like a thunder bolt and she stammers out a name jason
brightens jason voorhees
the perfect dream warrior
sounds like our man
excuse me einstein
but isnt jason voorhees dead
buried up by crystal lake somewhere
but dont worry i know how to bring him back to life
somehow i just knew you would
but thats not the problem
the problem is control
once we bring jason back from the dead
im not one hundred percent sure hell do what we tell him
well thats okay
as long as he doesnt chop us all up
erwin rolls his eyes around uncertain
im trusting you on this so tell me the truth
do you think if we do this if we go and get jason and bring him back to life that he could kill freddy
no doubt about
jason could wreck freddy on this side of the dreamline
but if freddy has home court advan tage
i dont know
too close to call
the trick would be to get jason to enter a dream state grab freddy and drag him out to our reality
i havent got a choice
ive got to try something
turns to stormie jesse i cant ask either of you to help me do this
its illegal immoral disgusting
hey we sisters have to stand together right
where you lead ill follow
count me in
meagan embraces stormie then all three turn to jesse
he looks them over and sighs let me get this straight
were going to go dig one dead maniac up to fight another dead maniac
thats about the size of it
and id be doing you a disservice if i said there werent a modicum of risk involved
i dont want to do this
you dont have to jesse
its not your fight
but i damn sure dont want you to do it without me
count me in
meagan hugs jesse
erwin tries to hug stormie but she pushes him away
look out freddy
here we come
in his shack listening to a small portable radio is the night watchman
his small dog suddenly perks up her ears and growls low
the watchman turns down the radio
whats matter girl
you hear somethin
then the old man hears it too
a low rumble
the night watchman steps out of his shack and squints into the darkness when a line of several hearses approaches
the lead hearse pulls up to the shack and the drivers window rolls down
continuing whats this
a funeral procession
a freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window and says thats exactly what it is
the cultist shoots the old man right through the head
the night watchman falls to the ground with a lifeless thud
the little dog starts barking ferociously when another shot silences her as well
another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to the gate cutting the chain with a pair of bolt cutters
he swings the gate open and the funeral procession proceeds inside
the cultists are standing around a small pit that two cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the wrecking yard
inside the pit the uncovered remains of freddy krueger nothing more than a pile of charred bones
lizzy is brought forward held by a couple cultists and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed around
she no longer struggles accepting her fate with droopy eyes
lizzys dream dope p
as she watches one of the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into freddys broken jawbone
her vision gets blurry
more surreal as another cult member steps forward with the tupperware
he pours the dream demons into the funnel
close on freddys remains as the dream demons swim around inside his skull
his bones start to bleed
blood becoming arteries and veins
vessels becoming muscle
muscle growing scarred flesh
there is a flash from the pit
then suddenly freddy krueger as youve known him as youve loved him leaps out of the pit and cries smokin
lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints
the cultists fire their weapons into the air and cheer as the building high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding them honk their horns and flash their lights
headlights as jesses car zooms past a sign that reads crystal lake miles
were almost there
we should pull over and ask directions
if it doesnt offend the men
there arent any
jesse pulls the car into an ol run down service station
i dont think theyre open
it says open all night
jesse honks the horn and yells hey
can we get some service out here
i dont think theres anybody here
suddenly a crazy ol coot appears on the opposite side with a shotgun
everyone in the car jumps
what do you kids want
were looking for the old cemetery thats supposed to be around here
what do you want to know for
we want to see it
aint nothin to see girly
cept a bunch of ol graves
can you give us directions or not
the old man gives the occupants of the car a going over with his one good eye hesitating a moment over erwin who scrunches down in the back seat hiding
under a baseball cap
youre not goin up there to do somethin stupid are you
laughs nervous stupid
like dig up jason voorhees thats what
everyone in the car takes a sharp breath cold busted
then they start saying no
and shaking their heads innocently in a big performance that wouldnt fool a stick
looks at meagan jesus
why would anyone do that
but people do
been dug up a few times already has he
more times than i care to remember
well were just doing an article for our high school newspaper about the dangers of breaking into cemeteries at night
you know stuff that can get you hurt
the ol coot scans the foursome again closely as he acquiesces
as long as youre not going up there to do something stupid
pointing take this road up about a mile and make a left at the ol saw mill
that road will take you right on in
eternal peace cemetery cant miss it
jesse is already standing on the gas leaving the ol coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust
headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway eternal peace cemetery illuminating a sign trespassers meagan jesse stormie and erwin enter the shadowy cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their shoulders
as they search through the cemetery meagan asks whats the story on jason voorhees anyway
where have you been
jason was that guy who ran around in a hockey mask chopping up camp counselors duh
i knew that
what i mean was why
it started a long time ago back in the fifties when jason drown at camp crystal lake
his mother went berserk and started killing the counselors
she got her head chopped off by one of the girls she was trying to kill
and then jason came back from his watery grave to get revenge
he came back from the grave
chopped up a number of people before they finally caught up to him
what happened to him then
they killed him
how can you kill somebody whos back from the grave
not very well apparently
jason keeps coming back to life and chopping people up
its a never ending cycle of terror up here at crystal lake a real problem
why does he keep coming back to life and killing people
they say hes looking for revenge on the camp counselor who murdered him as a child
jason just happens to go about it in the socially unacceptable way of hacking through every teenager he finds until he gets the right one
spots grave here it is
erwin shines his light on jasons grave
angle on tombstone jason voorhees
beneath the death date crudely scratched into the stone etc
jesse and erwin start digging
ellipsis cemetery statues watching them dig
stormie and meagan take their turn
jesse hits something solid
hands brush away the remaining dirt exposing the coffin below
jesse takes a sharp breath and then jams a crowbar under the lid forcing it open
the casket lid cracks open a bit when ssssss
noxious gas escapes
everyone covers their mouth and nose suppressing the urge to hurl
hundreds of roaches
meagan and stormie run off screaming batting at their hair and clothing
jesse rolls around on the ground
erwin sighs plucks a roach off his shirt and calmly eats it
meagan and stormie stand just outside the grave holding the light and a can of bug spray
their hair is up covered in plastic shower caps
duct tape around the cuffs of their pants
they arent taking anymore chances with bugs
jesse and erwin open the casket
everyone recoils at the stench
then they shine their lights inside nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey mask
the kids putting several plastic trash bags full of jason into the trunk of jesses car and slamming the lid closed
everyone piles into the car exhausted
in the back erwin picks his nose unaware that stormie is watching him her mouth gaping in horror
erwin becomes aware of stormies sickened scrutiny and pulls out his finger presenting it to stormie
laughs get it
stormie slaps his hand away
get back you nasty ass bastard
i thought i had seen the last of those when my brother graduated third grade
we just dug up a rotting corpse and youre worried about a little snot
jesse looks over at meagan curled up in a ball beside him
she purrs im exhausted
wake me when we get back home
better not fall asleep weve still got a lot of work to do and freddys out there
this news sobers everyone up immediately
well that means weve all got to stay awake
well sing a song
starts singing row
row your boat gently down the stream
merrily merrily merrily merrily
life is but a dream
come on everybody
meagan leads the none too enthusiastic group in another chorus of row your boat as jesses car roars off into the night
meagan is leaning up against the door murmuring softly to herself as she drifts off to sleep merrily merrily merrily merrily
life is but a dream
in the back seat erwin is nuzzled between stormies breasts sucking his thumb
both are fast asleep
jesse stares at the road ahead his own eyelids drooping
the car starts to weave
angle out windshield we flash past freddy holding a cardboard sign by the side of the road will kill jesse shakes his head nah
he tries to concentrate on the road his eyelids falling once more
jesses car zooms past a billboard
behind the bill board a highway patrol car a radar gun sticking out of the drivers window
close on radar gun as jesses car passes in the back ground the red digits cascading up
freddy now dressed as a highway patrolman sits behind the wheel
the radar guns display is reflected in his mirrored shades
it reads kill them
shouldnt dream and drive
freddy starts the car and pulls out but what comes out from behind the billboard isnt a patrol car its freddys nightmaremobile big chrome pipes belching hellfire
angle in jesses rearview mirror as jesses eyelids close and his head nods forward revealing the night maremobile closing from behind fast
the nightmaremobile runs up to the back of jesses car just an inch from the bumper
freddy moves one of the dozen of levers on the dash
close on freddys hood ornament a small version of freddys glove
it extends out towards the back of jesses car one of the tiny knives inserting into the trunk lock and turning with a slight click
the trunk lid opens
angle inside trunk the plastic bags with jasons remains are moving
freddy works another level and the tiny glove slits each bag
the various pieces of jason hands boots intestines etc
crawl out of the bag
continuing looks like the cats out of the bag now
freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk
the nightmaremobile pulls out from behind jesses car banging into the rear quarter panel
all four occupants of the car are jolted awake startled
meagan looks out her window and sees the nightmaremobile as it closes in again
freddy laughs as he falls back for another shot
meagan sees the dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night maremobile staring out at her through the back window
a small yellow sign reads lost souls on board
jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly the pieces of jason attack bursting from behind the back seat
one hand crawls up the back of the front seat leaping onto jesses throat
jasons intestines explode out of the backseat slithering and snaking their way around stormie and erwin
one of jasons boots wiggles under the seat making its way towards the gas peddle
the other boot is content to lay under the back window and kick erwin in the head
as meagan fights to pull jasons hand of jesses face she looks down and sees jasons other hand between her legs
jasons boot stomps on the gas and jesses car lurches forward with the acceleration
the nightmaremobile slams into the side of jesses car again causing it to swerve violently from side to side
inside the nightmaremobile freddy pulls another lever
close on the nightmaremobile fender as a panel opens up and a circular sawblade arm extends out cutting into jesses car with a flurry of sparks
inside meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg cutting forward towards
close on jesses front tire as the saw blade cuts into it
the tire blows and jesses car lurches off the road veering into a tree line
jesses car plows fender first into a tree the horn stuck on blaring
freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into overdrive roaring off and disappearing with an explosion of fire that wisps away in an instant
in the distance an old farmhouse
the lights go on inside
the passenger door opens and meagan falls out onto the ground bleeding from a slight scalp wound
a rear door opens and stormie and erwin spill out locked in embrace and not seriously hurt
meagan staggers around to the drivers side and opens the door
jesse is laying unconscious against the steering wheel
meagan pulls him off the wheel and the horn stops
jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess
continuing jesses hurt real bad
weve got to get him to a doctor
through the farmhouse window erwin and stormie see the farmer on the phone
an ambulance is on the way
meagan cradles jesses head in her hands crying oh god
erwin goes to the trunk and opens it
inside the garbage bags with jasons remains still inside untouched
erwin goes to meagan and says meagan
listen to me
the cops are on their way
if they find me and jason voorhees in the trunk there were finished
get out of here
take jason and stormie with you
im staying with you
erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says ill call you at the hospital
erwin takes off disappearing with jasons remains into the night as sirens wail in the distance growing close
jesse is laying in a hospital bed his leg in a special tent
meagan and stormie watch from the doorway as a doctor checks jesses vitals
as he finishes meagan asks is he going to be okay
but he needs a lot of rest
his leg is broken in four places and he has four broken ribs and a concussion
meagan sits down next to jesse taking his hand
stormie turns to the doctor
hey doc is there someplace i could get us something to eat
im afraid the cafeteria is closed
there are some vending machines in the lobby
to meagan ill be back to check on him in a couple of hours
the doctor exits
ill be right back
im goin go score us some munchies
meagan nods weakly
meagan lays her head on jesses hand
stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of the vending machine when she turns and sees murdoch at the information booth flashing photos of jesse and erwin
stormie dashes for the staircase
jesse and meagan have fallen asleep
jesses heart monitor beeps
on the wall an x ray viewer flickers to life
freddy peeks out from behind the other side
he snickers and ducks back down
suddenly freddys hand reaches up from inside the bed and grabs jesse pulling him down into the mattress
meagan wakes and sees this screaming as jesse grabs onto the curtain
close on curtain rod as the curtain pulls free of the rings
jesse disappears into the bed his screams echoing away
meagan looks under the bed nothing
she rises up again watching as jesses iv and electrode wires are pulled down after him
meagan grabs a handful of tubes and wire and tries to pull jesse back
but the pull is too strong and meagan goes into the mattress
meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol saloon
as she gets to her feet she sees jesses iv tubes running along the floor and out the door
meagan follows them to the saloon door where she stops and looks out into
standing in the middle of the street is jesse dressed in a cowboy sheriffs outfit complete with hat badge and gunbelt
meagan calls to him from the saloon door
but jesse cant hear her
hes too busy shaking with fear
staring at something coming down the street
dressed in a black bart cowboy outfit
ala john wayne okay sheriff
this nightmare aint big enough for the two of us
trembling with fear jesse fumbles for his pistol
he pulls it out and fires
jesse fires again
freddy just laughs
jesse fires again and again and again and freddy just laughs and laughs and laughs
from the saloon meagan screams jesse
freddy looks over at her annoyed
threes a crowd bitch
why dont you just go get beep the sound of jesses heart monitor beeping erratically wakes meagan with a start
she tries to wake jesse
jesse wake up
jesse keeps firing at freddy
until his gun clicks empty
freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest goddamn gun you ever saw and says go ahead
make my dream
jesses stomach explodes with blood splattering meagan
jesses heart monitor beeps continuously flat line
jesse is dead
a nurse shows up to answer the alarm
she sees meagan standing over jesses body covered in blood and screams
stormie enters the room a half second later and gasps
freddy killed jesse
stormie reaches in and grabs meagan pulling her out of the room
stormie drags a shell shocked meagan down the hall the screams of the nurse fading into the distance
get a grip lady
youd think a nurse in a hospital would have seen a dead body before
just then stormie spots murdoch and his men getting off the elevator
they hear the nurses screams and come running towards jesses room
stormie pulls meagan behind the nurses station just as murdoch and company go thundering past
then a voice on the p
says filtered attention
would meagan or stormie please pick up the white paging phone for a message
stormie and meagan exchange worrisome looks
the announcement repeats itself again
stormie cant stand it anymore she stands up and picks up the white paging phone
into phone this is stormie
murdoch and his men come running past the nurses station again
stormie turns her back to them but murdoch goes back to the nurses station asking did you see a couple of girls go by here a moment ago
stormie gestures to the elevators
just missed em
murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his men right behind
stormie exhales a giant sigh of relief as the hospital operator says filtered the message is from erwin
he says to meet him at the side entrance in two minutes
stormie hangs up and grabs meagan running for the staircase
stormie drags meagan out of the hospital just as erwin pulls up in an old battered pick up truck
he throws open the door and stormie pushes meagan inside climbing in after her and asking whered you get the truck
same place ive got jason hid
and wheres that
a place where no one ever goes
stormie closes the door and the pick up truck roars out of the parking lot
the pick up trucks headlights skew across a weather worn sign peppered with bullet holes camp crystal lake erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp past the cabins down
towards the lake
he stops a short distance away from the pier and the three of them climb out
meagan is still in shock letting stormie guide her as erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving platform tied up to the end
whatd you do take him for a swim
erwin jumps down on the diving platform
in the center a large form is covered by a tarp
erwin helps stormie down onto the platform leaving meagan standing on the pier
she looks out over the lake eyes vacant
erwin moves close to stormie and gesturing to meagan asks continuing is she going to be alright
i dont know
shes pretty fucked up
god i dont know why im not
youre a strong woman
whats that supposed to mean
i didnt mean anything
stormie gestures to the tarp
is this him
whips back tarp meet the new and improved jason
angle on jason laying spread eagle on the diving platform cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of coiled leads trailing off into the water
erwin has done a good job of sewing jason back together with barbed wire and fishing line
his arms and legs have been reinforced with steel braces and even jasons mask has been repaired stitched down the middle with bailing wire
jason looks nineties
whyd you put that stupid mask on him
take a look
stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask and quickly replaces it
not exactly a beauty queen entry is he
so what do we do now sing an ozzy osbourne song backwards or something
im afraid its not that simple
i thought you said you knew how to bring him back to life
but when i was putting him back together i noticed something was missing
stormie thinks about this for a second then awwww he wont be needing that
i mean what girl would let him put his rotten ol
cuts her off no no
its his heart
does it really matter
cant you use an aquarium pump or something
he has to have a heart
a human heart
a good one
meagan speaks for the first time i know where we can get a heart
a good one
a sign reads city morgue
through the front window a guard can be seen sitting at the reception desk
erwin stormie and meagan watch him from the pick up parked a safe distance away
that guard in there might pose a problem
do you think you and stormie could keep him occupied for a few minutes
erwin and stormie exchange looks then shrug why not
lets do it
a few moments later the guard looks up as the pick up swerves wildly into the parking lot
he gets up and goes to the glass door peering out
angle through glass door as stormie and erwin start making out hot and heavy
meagan breaks a small window near the ceiling
she crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops to the floor
she shines her flashlight around the dark laboratory illuminating anatomy charts jars full of organs etc
crossing to the lockers meagan tentatively opens one of the drawers and shines her light inside ug
she opens the next drawer ick
meagan opens a third drawer jesse
her lip starts to quiver as she caresses his face
at the glass door the guard is watching the action in the parking lot his breath fogging the window
he wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a better look
inside the truck stormie and erwin wrestle around
im just trying to make it look real
just keep your hands above the bra pizza face
the windows are starting to steam up
meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber gloves
then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru ments saws rib cutters etc
and selects a large knife
meagan stands over jesses body
she pulls back the sheet exposing his chest
meagan raises the knife far above her head
forgive me jesse
meagan plunges the knife into jesses chest with a sickening thwack
the windows of the pick up are now badly fogged obscuring the guards view
he licks his lips deciding to investigate closer
the guard unlocks the front door and starts toward stormie and erwin
they spot him coming and break their embrace
in another moment the pick up is peeling out of the parking lot
the guard watches the truck go shakes his head and goes back inside to start his rounds
up the street parked with the lights off in the night shade of a large tree stormie and erwin watch as the guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
hes head right for her
do some thing
erwin panics for a moment then honks the horn
meagan is trying to pull jesses heart out of his chest but it just wont come some vein or muscle fiber keeps pulling it back
she jumps at the horn then starts pulling harder
in the hallway just outside the guard hears the horn and stops
he starts back for the front when suddenly the horn stops
meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling to jesses heart
as the last strand goes meagan tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud thud
the guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue drawing his gun
he tip toes to the door and carefully unlocks it leaving his keys in the lock
taking a two handed weaver stance the guard raises his foot and kicks the door
the door flies open and the guard leaps inside like marshall dillon snapping on the lights
he gasps eyes going wide as he scans the room
one of the drawers is open
the stiffs chest has got a huge hole in it
blood spattered everywhere
a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the cabinet
suddenly the guard sees meagan half out the window and cries stop right there
meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard fires
the unbroken section of the window shatters
the guard curses and races for the
the guard comes running out just in time to see meagan close the passenger door and the truck roar away
he shrinks dejected no way to catch them now
the guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds that the door has closed and locked behind him
the crazy ol coot is leading murdoch through the cemetery
they said they were writin for some newspaper
teenagers are notorious liars
well after i heard about the accident on my police scanner i came up here to have a look
when i found it i figured youd want to know right away
you did the right thing
the ol coot shines his light down into jasons empty grave
i just knew they were comin up here to do somethin stupid
commander comes up to murdoch
just got a call on the radio three juveniles just broke into the morgue one male two female
the guard is pretty sure the male is in the freddy cult burnt face
sounds like the same kids i saw
did the guard say what they took
that murdered kid jesse they carved his heart out
beat they got away in a pick up the guard didnt get the license
you want me to put out an a
that wont be necessary
i know just where theyre going and just what theyre up to
and this time
ill be ready
meagan sits on the end of the pier watching silently as erwin sews jesses heart into jasons chest using dental floss
stormie comes up behind her and puts her jacket around meagans shoulders sits down beside her and says youve got to quit blaming your self for what happened to jesse
it wasnt your fault
he didnt want to come with us
but he did anyway
he did it for me
im not sorry i came
i dont think jesse would be either
i just cant believe hes dead
i keep thinking hell show up any minute
well that just about does it
erwin finishes sewing up jason and climbs back onto the pier cutting the diving platform free
he kicks it off and it floats out into the lake drifting free
then erwin herds the girls down the shore leading them over to where a short trench has been dug leading from the waters edge
in the bottom of the trench an uncovered power cable
continuing as you can see ive excavated the power cable that runs across the bottom of crystal lake
ive cut away the insulation exposing a patch of cable right near the waters edge
erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it at the head of the trench
continuing now when i kick this over the water will wash down the trench and bridge an eletrical gap between the cable and the lake
theres plenty of voltage so it should work
so you kick the bucket and jason lives
then okay keep your fingers crossed
erwin kicks the bucket over
the water washes down the trench over the cable and pow
z z z zap
a huge spark hits explodes
then the lake begins to glow and the water begins to churn
erwin and the girls jump back as electricity arcs from the lake engulfing the diving platform
the arcs of electricity leap from the chicken wire onto jasons body his massive frame convulsing
close on hockey mask as we push in the electricity spirals down into the eye hole like water running down a drain
close on jasons eye as it opens
we dive into the eye and take a fantastic dream time travel to
close on mask s version of a hockey mask reflected in the water
a young hand reaches up and pulls off the mask revealing the disfigured boy beneath
this is jason age
jasons father comes to the doorway of their run down cabin in dirty longjohns holding a bottle of rye
he bellows jason
git your ass over here
jason jumps at his fathers voice hesitates only slightly then runs toward him stopping abruptly several paces away
continuing what did i teach you boy
dont ever take your mask off out in public
i dont want nobody to see that ugly mug of yours
jason stands looking at his bare feet
his father smacks him upside the head shoving him towards the woodshed
continuing go git in the woodshed
jasons pace slows as he enters the dark shed he knows whats coming next
continuing drop them overalls and lay over them logs
jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt
suddenly jasons mother is just outside the doorway calling jason
jason gives his father a sideways glance then scurries towards his mother
what are you doing woman
jasons mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with dollars and change
i saved up some money
i want you to take and go on up to that summer camp just up the road
tell the man you want to stay there
just what the hell do you think youre doing bitch
im sending him away for a few weeks
you aint sending him nowhere
to jason bring me that money boy
jason holds his ground for a second unsure whom to obey when his mother shoos him away
go on now
jason takes off up the road
his father sneers goin agin me
ill take you to the shed woman
jasons mother pulls a knife from her apron
you aint ever taking anyone to the shed ever again
jasons mother charges at her husband shoving him back into the shed with the knife
jason looks back
through the open window he sees his mothers arm coming down repeatedly with the knife his fathers arms flailing helplessly
then both disappear from view
after a moment his mother appears in the door way spattered with blood
she smiles and waves to him calling continuing go on son
have a good time
mommy will come and git you some day soon
jason turns and runs to
wearing his mask jason walks through the entrance to the camp with his jar of money
in the office the head counselor takes his money and shakes his hand
welcome aboard son
im sure youll have a great time
the other kids dance around jason taunting him
laughing at him
pointing and teasing
jason breaks away running towards the pier
jason sits at the end of the pier looking at his own reflection
he removes the mask and watches as the distortions in the water make his face look normal
someone comes up behind jason slowly
jason isnt aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection appears behind his own
jason turns to see who when he is suddenly pushed into the lake
jason splashes to the surface sputtering trying to stay afloat
a hand pushes his head back under the water
jasons underwater p
a distorted image of whoever is holding him under
jason thrusts out his arms fighting to get back to the surface
fighting just to see who is killing him before he dies
jason comes alive thrashing around on the diving dock the electricity all over him like a spider web
on shore erwin and the girls gasp
meagan and stormie bounce excitedly
but something is wrong
jason thrashes around on the dock unable to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire
its kill him
shut it off
shut it off
shut it off
it suddenly occurs to me that i hadnt really planned for that contingency
just dont stand there
but all erwin can do is scratch his head
meagan rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake jason
youve got to get up
do you hear me
jason clenches his meaty fists and slams them down against the diving dock
smashing it to bits
water rushes over him and zzzzt
a power transformer on shore explodes causing meagan and her friends to cringe
when they look back the electrical light show fades away leaving nothing but smoke and floating debris
meagan and stormie turn to erwin who shrugs shyly and says well
its off now
meagan and stormie begin a verbal barrage that would shrink any man to pus
much less erwin
he cowers between them offering quick excuses and humble apologies
all three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they never notice jasons shadowy figure as it rises from the lake
then they do see him
scream and run
jason charges after the kids in his familiar unstoppable killer gait
erwin ducks inside the tool shed as meagan and stormie dash past
he closes the door behind him and squirms out a tiny window just as jason kicks open the door and steps inside
erwin races around to the front and closes the door
he fastens the latch and padlock then calls to the girls continuing hey
ive got him locked up in the tool shed
just then the sound of a chainsaw as the blade rips through the tool shed door
erwin screams like a girl and runs away
meagan and stormie run into the main room
stormie spots a phone and goes to it dialing frantically
who are you calling
are you kidding
theyll lock us up and throw away the key
fine by me
clicks the receiver damnit
just then erwin bursts into the cabin slamming the door shut behind him
hes right behind me
stormie and meagan look out the window sure enough jason is storming towards them holding the chainsaw
to erwin youre the one who brought him back to life
well do something
erwin screams and runs for the closet hiding inside
stormie clucks continuing oh some hero
just then the chainsaw rips through the front door
meagan and stormie scream and follow erwin into the closet closing themselves inside
they cower in the closet listening
for a long moment
nothing but the sound of their heavy breathing
then with the ripping of wood jason chainsaws the closet door knocking it to the floor
erwin draws out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger
jason charges forward when meagan suddenly stands up in front of him and yells to everyones shock
were the ones that brought you back to life
and you have no right to kill us with that chainsaw
you owe us
she gave you her boyfriends heart you know
jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup
heres his picture
meagan takes off the necklace that jesse gave her and opens the locket
she shows jason the photo of jesse inside
jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket in his humongous hands gently touching the photo of jesse with a meaty finger
continuing now i know that youve been through a lot
and i know that youre pissed off about being murdered and all
interjects i know i would be
but if you help us kill freddy krueger
i promise to help you find the little bastard that killed you
what do you say
have we got a deal
meagan sticks out her hand to shake
jason stares at it looks back at the locket then to meagan
finally he reaches out his huge hand for meagans when
brilliant blinding white light blazes through the windows freezing everyone to the spot
anxious to get out of the closet with jason erwin crawls across the floor and peeks out over the window sill
angle out window a dozen police cars shine their lights towards the cabin two dozen cops aim their weapons
in the middle of this impressive show of force is murdoch
he raises a bullhorn to his lips
through bullhorn you in there
this is captain renton murdoch state trooper
i am ordering you to come out with your hands up
ill give you until the count of three
meagan turns to jason shoving him back into the closet
whispering jason you have to hide
stay in here and dont come out until we tell you
stormie helps meagan stuff jason into the closet closing the door
then they quickly smooth down their hair and clothes moving towards the door
meagan stormie and erwin come out with their hands raised high above their heads
as they walk towards the police cars several of the s
team moves in and arrests them
as they are handcuffed and searched murdoch goes on the bullhorn again through bullhorn alright
anybody else left in there had better say their prayers
theres no one else inside
is that a fact
into bullhorn okay
you had your chance
suddenly one of the cops points towards the cabin and shouts hey look
all heads turn towards the cabin where jasons massive frame is filling the doorway
holy mary mother of god
would you look at the size of that guy
almost happy i knew it
all the cops level their weapons at jason when murdoch suddenly steps forward gesturing for everyone to get behind him
continuing stand back
ill handle this
murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers continuing you
jason raises the chainsaw he remembers murdoch too
murdoch goes for his gun but instead of bringing out a pistol he holds a laser designator
a big red dot appears on jasons chest
jason looks down at it like it was a harmless bug
he looks back up at murdoch who raises a radio to his lips and says continuing into radio let her go
a military jet flying above drops its payload a laser guided napalm bomb
a slight whistle sound grows in the skies above camp crystal lake
jason looks up
smart bomb p
as it drops down on jason homing in on the laser dot on his chest
camp crystal lake explodes in flames
all the cops take cover as fire rains down on them
only murdoch stands his ground his arms outstretched as he embraces the terrible sight
thatll teach you to fuck with the law voorhees
a cop behind him says uhh sir
your hats on fire
murdoch looks up sure enough his smokey bear hat is burning above the brim
meagan watches as camp crystal lake is consume in flames her last hope of saving lizzy gone
then a cop shoves her into a police car with stormie
erwin is put into another car and the three exchange worrisome looks through the windows just before the cars pull away
as the cops start to pull out one of them notices something moving amidst the flames a large burning form walking towards the lake
as it stumbles out onto the pier the cop turns to his partner and says hey
do you see that
but just then the form falls through the burning pier splashing into the water below
the partner looks sees nothing and shrugs
i thought i saw something
he shrugs it off and exits after his partner
murdoch his hat still smoking a little surveys the sight one last time before climbing into his patrol car and driving away
a cell door slams in front of stormies face
a cell door slams in front of meagans face
both girls are behind bars separated by a cement wall
the hefty female deputy in charge of the cellblock goes back to her desk
both girls stand in their cells next to eachother watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and begins to devour three combo burritos
weve got to try and stay awake
getting something to eat might help
calls to deputy yo butch
its deputy miller
excuse me deputy miller but could we have something to eat
i thought you psychos only ate human hearts
and i thought you pigs only ate donuts
dont make me come back there
low to meagan cow
i hope she chokes on her three combo burrito cud
meagan leans up against the wall sliding down to the floor in defeat
what am i going to do
ill never be able to find lizzy now
you should be worrying about your self
i know i am
stormie plops down on her cot
i bet youre sorry you came with me now
what are best friends for
afterall you stuck by me through all my crazy phases i figure i owe you one big crazy phase right
thats for being my best friend stormie
just then deputy miller steps in front of meagans cell unlocking it
come on meagan
where are we going
your parents are here
deputy miller brings meagan out of the cellblock where her mom and dad are waiting with captain murdoch
meagans mom rushes up and hugs meagan
are you alright
let me look at you
im okay mom
your mothers been worried sick meagan
so have i
meagan stands handcuffed her hair mussed her clothes bloody and soiled
today has been a bitch
the deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos that she doesnt notice the strange shadow that passes behind her
the shadow moves down the cellblock accompanied by a slight scraping
freddys glove materializes raking the knives along the metal cross bars
freddy stops at stormies cell looking inside
stormie is fast asleep
freddy walks into stormies cell passing right through the bars
suddenly stormie wakes and seeing freddy jumps to her feet and screams
but the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesnt respond finishing off the rest of the burrito and licking her meaty fingers clean
freddy puts his forefinger knife to his lips and shushes stormie pointing to her cot
stormie looks over and sees her self asleep
continuing oh shit
im still asleep
she looks up at freddy who smiles and says you know what they say
when you sleep you die
freddy flashes the glove of knives
meagan captain murdoch here said you helped one of those cultists escape from a hospital
a mental hospital
and he said you desecrated a cemetery and some other really terrible things
tell me you had nothing to do with it
tell me theres some mistake
theres no mistake
to murdoch what did you do with erwin
your boyfriend is headed back to the looney bin where he belongs
but dont worry youll be seeing him soon enough
at the arraignment
freddy taunts stormie as the circle around in the cell by slicing off his fingers squirting green slime
stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool
you dont scare me freddy
thanks to my various phases and many hours of watching violent televison i have become immune to violence
seen it all and done it all
nothing you do can gross me out so why dont you give it your best shot bitch
then maybe ill just cut to the chase
freddy swings the glove but stormie ducks keeping her defensive stance
im warning you freddy
my father is a drill sergeant in the marine corps and he taught me just how to defend myself against slimy bastards like you
oh im so scared honey
punch me right in the nose
i dare you
freddy juts out his chin gesturing for stormie to take a punch
stormie throws a right and pops freddy right in the nose
continuing surprised owwwww
stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her fist is stuck in freddys nose
freddy takes in a breath and stormies arm is sucked up past the elbow
freddy takes a deep breath and snorts stormie right up his nose her screams turning into a faint buzz
continuing now thats what i call getting a buzz
now the size of a flea stormie is clinging to one of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from the circular walls freddys nose hairs
stuck in those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk boogers
sitting next to stormie a particularly large and rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says in the distorted voice of harry manfredini hi there
im the boogerman
stormie screams backing up into the trees trying to put distance between herself and boogerman
continuing aww dont go
we can play star wars
you can be princess leia and ill be jabba the hutt
boogerman licks his fat nasty lips with a slimy green tongue he does kinda look like jabba
stormie screams again
meagan is getting more and more agitated
were wasting time
weve got to close down all the churches freddy has to marry lizzy on holy ground
meagans parents stare at their daughter with confused frightened looks
continuing dont you understand
he has to come to our reality to do it
its our last chance to kill him
okay i think weve heard enough of this crap
take her back to the lockup
a couple of deputies grab meagan
she throws them off and they grab her again roughly
meagans parents watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their daughter back to her cell kicking and screaming
dont let them lock me up
i have to save lizzy
you dont even realize what youve done
i did what i had to do to try and save lizzy
yeah including murdering your boy friend and cutting his heart out
freddy killed jesse
he was already dead when i cut his heart out
meagans mom and dad gasp recoiling with horror
continuing manic goddamnit you dont understand
meagans raving grows faint as she disappears into the cellblock
murdoch pulls meagans dad aside
i know how you must feel
i had a dog once
i loved that dog
i treated her like my own daughter
we went camping picnics in the park
i even had a little stocking for her nailed up on the mantle for christmas
then one day she bit me
so i had to blow her brains out
sighs god i loved that dog
freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger knife
a giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril cavern sending stormie into hysterics
uh oh freddys picking his nose again gotta go
boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the nostril cavern
stormie watches the massive knife blade as it comes right for her then at the last possible second she starts climbing after boogerman
she pushes past the disgusting blob of goo racing ahead
continuing well excuse me
insert freddy pushes the knife way far back into his head
the giant knife spears boogerman in the back running him through and spilling his boogerman guts out his front
stormie gives a little squeal as boogerman is pulled out kicking and screaming
freddy withdraws the knife from his nose peering closely at the tiny boogerman impaled on the end
he twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks booger man across the cell
boogerman screams as he flies across vast space smack ing into the far wall with a giant splat
boogerman flattens outwards into a thin pancake of boogerman goo his nasty head still alive in the center
freddy reaches through the bars of the cell his arm extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to the deputys desk
he feels around on the table until he touches the pepper shaker drawing it back into stormies cell
freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his right palm and breathes it in deeply the specks of pepper becoming rocks that pelt stormie as she clings to life
deep inside the nostril
freddys face begins to distort his nose wrinkling up the beginnings of a sneeze
micro stormie comes blasting out of freddys nose with globules of snot
she flies across the massive cell headed directly for the splattered boogerman screaming her head off
boogerman sees stormie racing towards him and he screams too
as the deputy brings meagan back to her cell they hear a loud splat
the deputy pushes meagan back as she moves forward cautiously glancing around the wall into stormies cell
then promptly puking combo burrito
meagan runs up and looks
the wall to stormies cell is splattered with blood and bits
meagan falls to her knees sobbing as more deputies come running into the cellblock answering the deputys puke choked scream
continuing oh god
what have i done
what have i done
we boom out of this chaos and go to
an ambulance races along the road with its emergency lights flashing
in back erwin lays strapped to a gurney
up front sit a driver and an attendant
they chat disparagingly about the freak in the back when suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead
the driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up with a terrible squeal
the ambulance plows into the form knocking it some fifty feet down the road
the driver and the attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock
finally the driver turns to the attendant and says ill go check it out
you stay here
the driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the road
he bends down to examine the charred mammoth carcass when a fist flies up smacking the driver in the face
he falls to the ground unconscious
the corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights its jason
burnt and blackened but ready for action
he starts towards the ambulance
the attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver emptying into jasons chest
jason recoils only slightly as bullet hits burst his coveralls then he grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty pistol in panic
jason slams the attendants face into the side of the ambulance
in the back of the ambulance a terror stricken erwin watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with a sickening wrenching of metal and flesh
jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance and climbs inside the shocks bottoming out under his weight
he reaches out for erwin who closes his eyes
waiting for the inevitable
after a second erwin opens an eye
jason is standing over him hand outstretched
in his big burnt palm meagans necklace
erwin looks from the necklace to jason
jason thrusts out his hand impatiently
want me to tell you where meagan is
again with the thrusting
continuing well why didnt you say so
jesus for a minute there i thought you were going to kill me
then youre not are you
jason shakes his palm at erwin yet a third time
ill take you right to her
could you help me out of this
jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps
erwin exits out the back with jason following close behind
erwin climbs in behind the wheel saying continuing ill drive
jason pushes erwin aside so roughly that he slams into the passenger side door
as jason climbs into the drivers seat a chime goes off as a female computer voice in a pleasant tone says fasten your safety belt please
erwin fastens his
jason watches him and pulls the safety belt across his massive chest it wont reach
jason pulls harder ripping the belt out of the bolts
the chime goes crazy
continuing fasten your safety belt please
fasten your safety belt please
jason smashes the dashboard with his fist silencing the voice and chime
he turns suddenly to erwin as if to say yeah
what about it
erwin shrugs nervously fuck the bitch
with tires squealing burning rubber and smoke the ambulance roars away into the early morning
meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun as it peeks out over the horizon
the deputy gets up to leave for the six a
as she goes she switches on the cellblock tv
angle on tv an early morning religious program is on
filtered this is channel station w
where the w stands for worship and now
daily affirmation with reverend lawrence lovejoy
a shot of the reverend lovejoy at the podium in his studio giving kind words of encouragement
good morning friends
the good book says that each morning brings a new light into our lives
the good reverend goes on about it always being darkest before the dawn have faith and your prayers will be answered etc
meagan turns and watches the sunrise glorious
tears stream down her cheeks
then a commercial comes on filtered you can own a videotape of reverend lovejoys daily affirmation for only
in his booth at the main gate the gate guard watches as a procession of hearses approaches
as the first hearse reaches the gate the guard steps out and says hello
what can i do for you
a cultist sticks his head out the window and says were here to see the reverend lovejoy
we need him to perform a wedding
do you have an appointment
i have a beretta
the cultist produces a pistol bang
the reverend lovejoy is at his podium his wife at the organ waiting for the commercial break to be over
the floor manager counts down three
the cultists burst into the studio
the camera operator and floor manager are killed
the reverend lovejoy and his wife at the organ are taken hostage
angle on tv as the cultists take the reverend and his wife hostage
meagan watches suddenly perplexed
the cultists break into the control room killing the director and staff
one slips into the sound booth garroting the religious announcer with a piece of wire
another smashes the control board killing the signal
all the feed monitors go snowy
angle on tv as the picture goes to static
just then the deputy appears in front of meagans cell
something just happened at the tv station
dont worry about it get undressed
time to get you cleaned up for court
meagan looks back at the tv as she slowly starts to get undressed
the deputy ushers meagan into the showers
inside a naked group of mean nasty ugly jail house bitches are showering washing hairy pits flabby tattooed skin and greasy hair
they eye meagan like the dessert bar at dennys as she crosses to the opposite side sneaking into a corner
meagan turns on the shower and drops the towel the bitches whistle and catcall
just then the deputy gets called away leaving meagan to the mercy of the bitches
the head bitch slides over to meagan and says whats the matter honey
you dont like our company
i like you
its just that i usually shower alone thats all
so youre shy
i like em when theyre shy
the head bitch grabs at meagan who resists
but this bitch is big and tough and holds meagan by the wrists as she tries to kiss her
the other bitches laugh
continuing dont fight it baby
you know you want me
meagan scratches the head bitchs face
she backs off screaming wiping blood from her face
then she spits reaches down below the frame line and produces a shiv
continuing if you wont give me a piece then ill just cut one for myself
the head bitch moves in
meagan takes a cautious step back bumping into tile nowhere to go
she holds up her hands
wait a second
i didnt mean to do that
its just that you come on a little strong thats all
just give me a little time to adjust to my new surroundings
the head bitch stops curious
are you saying you want me now
i want you
meagan comes up to the woman raising her arms
in a flash the head bitch has the shiv to meagans jugular a warning
meagan carefully puts her arm around the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth
after a long uncomfortable moment they break
the head bitch smiles
continuing now thats more like it
to the others hey this bitch is alright
the other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her arm around meagans waist and pulls her tight
continuing youre okay honey
whats your name
whatre you in for meagan
sniffles a little oh my friend
the bitch that died last night
starts to cry yeah
they said she had some disease that made her
please hold me
the head bitch holds meagan tight as she sobs smoothing her hair
the other bitches share a look of concern as one asks whats this bullshit about some killer funk make you explode
to meagan easy
its goin be alright
but what i asked you is why youre in here
well they think i gave it to her
the head bitch suddenly springs back as if meagan were satan himself
she runs for the other bitches but they arent having anything to do with her
all the bitches race for the exit
the deputy comes to the shower room doorway and shouts what the hell is all the screaming about
the bitches run her over stripping the keys from her belt
they unlock the cellblock door and go running into the police station screaming butt naked
after the bitches exit meagans hand reaches out and drags the unconscious deputy into the shower
the bitches come running butt naked and screaming through the station
several deputies chase after them tackle them and try to cuff them
a brawl ensues
murdoch sits on a desk reading a report
he looks up at the madness and mutters punks
a deputy enters the showers and sees a naked woman on top of a deputy their arms locked in a struggle
the deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the head with her baton and she falls to the side revealing meagan now dressed in the deputys uniform laying
on the shower floor
the deputy realizes her mistake too late meagan sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to her knees screaming and clutching her face
meagan leaps to her feet grabs a towel to hold over her face as if she had a broken nose and starts to exit
on her way out meagan is passed by several deputies charging into the showers to restore order
she gestures them on then slips into an emergency exit to freedom
meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls up
she reaches in and grabs the junior trooper pulling him out
then she slips behind the wheel and roars off
the junior trooper calls after her hey thats captain murdochs car
the cultists surround reverend lovejoy as he nervously shakes his head saying i wont do it
its a sin
one of the cultists puts a gun to mrs
wedding or funeral
the reverend swallows and says and who would be the bride
lizzy is brought forth
the cultists take her arm and inject her with the dream dope
lizzys head lulls around as she chants softly one
freddys coming for you
the rest of the cultists shoot up passing the needle from one to another
better lock your door
the good reverend watches this with a lump in his throat
he shudders and asks and the groom
lizzy is almost asleep
grab your crucifix
the neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker
then with a sharp snap of electricity the cross falls over turning upside down
it hangs there for an instant then pow
the cross explodes catching the curtains on fire
as the flames consume the curtains a hole in reality appears a dreamgate
freddy comes springing out leaping in front of the podium
he laughs and turns to lizzy asleep on the bench
thats for the lift sister
to the cultists hiya kids
in unison hiya freddy
ready to get hitched
then lets do it
lizzy looks up and smiles
i love you freddy
a deputy comes up to murdoch and says we found your patrol car captain
it was abandoned near a local religious station
is there a padre there
reverend lovejoy broad casts out of that location
so thats where theyre hiding
lizzy and freddy stand before reverend lovejoy
and if there be anyone among you who has any reason why these two should not be joined in holy
freddy holds up a finger ah ah
continuing in matrimony
let them speak now
under his breath please god
aloud or forever hold their peace
meagan bursts in
everyone turns and looks as meagan comes to the pulpit
continuing to freddy take me freddy
take me instead
youre a virgin
oh thats right tell everybody
freddy moves close to meagan running a blade over and around meagans neck as she struggles to remain calm
yes you are a bit juicier than your retard sister
okay youve got the job
to cultists get her ready
outside the cultists surrounding the outside of the station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to the fence
murdoch and the s
commander get out of the lead car
murdoch picks up his bullhorn and says through bullhorn this is captain renton murdoch state trooper
im giving you until the count of three to come out with your hands up
a cultist sniper fires a shot at murdoch the bullet hit smashing the emergency lights atop his car
the other cops duck down but not murdoch he turns calmly to the s
commander and says continuing hand me that flare pistol
the commander gives the flare gun to murdoch adding good idea
throw a little light on them see if we can spot their firing positions
as the commander speaks murdoch aims the pistol carefully and fires
the flare streaks to the roof of the tv station smacking the sniper
he bursts into flames and tumbles to the ground screaming
murdoch hands the flare gun back to the commander going back on the bullhorn and saying through bullhorn alright now im through playing nice guy i want the rest of
you punks to come out right now with your hands up
the cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead bullet hits riddle the cop cars smashing glass and piercing metal
the cops fire back bullet hits exploding all along the sides of the tv station
the cultists bare meagans arm and inject her with dream dope
she takes her place at the threshold beside freddy
as the battle outside between the cultists and the cops rages murdoch and the s
commander squat down behind a fender to reload
well it doesnt look like theyre going to surrender
what were going to need then is somebody to charge their lines make a hole for us to slip in
where are you going to find anyone that crazy
just then an ambulance comes roaring through the police lines causing the cops to scurry like mice
here comes one now
yells murdoch squints to see whos driving
erwin smiles and waves to murdoch through the passenger side window as the ambulance zooms past
murdoch curses drawing his pistol and shooting after the ambulance
the other cops join in a moment later bullet hits sparking off the back of the ambulance as it crashes through the front gate
inside the ambulance erwin hazards a glance back at the cops then he turns to jason and says that was easy enough
erwin looks ahead and screams
angle through windshield as three cultists stand directly in front of the speeding ambulance firing machine guns
the glass explodes just as erwin ducks down
two cultists suddenly scatter as jason rams the ambulance into the middle one just before plowing into the side of the station with a crash
erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a cultist closing in with a gun
he reaches through the smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultists machine gun laying on the hood
erwin turns shoots the cultist just in time
as jason kicks open the drivers side door he is greeted by two cultists shooting at him
jason rips off the drivers side door and hurls it at the two punks knocking them down like bowling pins
then jason reaches back into the ambulance pulls out the jaws of life and with erwin covering his back starts towards the front door
the wedding proceeds
if there be anyone among you who does not want these two people to be joined
let him speak now or forever hold his peace
meagan looks around
no one says anything
the reverend clears his throat to continue when
the studio door flies open and jason appears in the doorway holding the jaws of life
the cultists attack jason
jason grabs the first one with the jaws of life folds him in half like a rag doll
another attacks with a machete
one more cultist down and now jason owns the machete
jason finishes off the last two cultists as erwin barricades the studio door
the cultists on the other side start pounding
jason starts swinging at freddy with the machete slicing through a camera cable
close on cable as it falls to the floor
freddy jumps back through the dreamgate closing it behind him
erwin runs over to meagan and lizzy
he tries to wake them but cant
as jason lumbers over erwin looks up and says i cant wake them up
freddys got them trapped
erwin thinks for a moment then rushes over to a couple of dead cultists
he takes their syringes
erwin jabs jason in the neck with two syringes full of dream dope
continuing go get him boy
jason staggers forward falling into
jason falls into a boxing arena
the ropes are entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human head
the spectators are all demons monsters and the living dead
jason looks over at his opponent dressed in boxing shorts shoes and gloves its freddy
jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing boxing gloves
ted bundy steps into the ring
into microphone ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the fight of the century
im your ring announcer
a bullet hole appears in teds forehead blowing his brains out the back
he falls over dead and the crowd cheers
ted sits up and pulls the wig back over his shaved head and electric burns as he calls into the balcony continuing verrrrrry funny oswald
angle in balcony oswald stands his rifle still smoking
angry defensive it wasnt me
ted bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro in my left corner weighing in at only ninety seven pounds
the nightmare master himself
freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild
continuing and on my right
weighing in at a whopping four hundred and thir teen pounds
that killer of countless teenagers
the big guy
gestures to jason jason voorhees
cheers and boos
continuing and the prize tonight
not one but two count em two virgins
ripe for the picking
ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena
inside meagan and lizzy clutch eachother
continuing hey have one now and save the other for the ride home
thats what i did
laughter from the crowd
kick his ass jason
the bell sounds
the first round begins
freddy starts towards jason cocking his glove for a blow when ch ching
knife blades jut out of the glove
he punches jason in the stomach and starts ripping him open rotten guts spilling out
jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an axe in her head
this is bloody mary
jason reaches over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of her head
bloody mary whips around yelling jason swings with the axe sh wack
jason slices off freddys arm
the crowd roars
freddy looks down at the open armpit gushing with rotten blood and shrugs oh well
i just axed for that
freddy grows a new arm complete with glove of knives
jason throws the axe at freddy who ducks it
the axe flies into the audience smacking mussolini square between the eyes
he falls back to the floor
hitler turns to eva braun and says disdainfully peasants
the bell sounds
freddy and jason break going into their respective corners
as jason sits down in his corner the human head mounted on his corner post starts in thats it kiddo
youre really giving it to him out there
use the left more jab
make him hurt
thats the ticket to a knockout
up in her cage meagan clutches a terrifed lizzy
erwin watches jason sleep as the cultists bang down the studio door
the bell sounds again and round two begins
freddy and jason get to their feet and close in on each other
jason swings wide
freddy ducks under jasons massive fist just as the referee steps in for a close look
whump jason knocks the refs head off it goes flying up into the balcony
the crowd jason chases freddy around the ring looking for an opening
freddy backpeddles tripping over the refs decapitated body as several hungry zombies drag him out of the ring ripping his body apart and devouring it
up in their cage meagan and lizzy grimace with disgust
jason reaches down and grabs freddy hoisting him high above his head
then jason body slams freddy to the mat
the crowd cheers
jason starts jumping up and down on freddys back
freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty can of spinach
in a grotesque parody of popeye he opens the can full of nasty worms and maggots and gulps it down
suddenly freddy throws jason off his back and stands huge muscles ballooning on his chest and arms
at the end of his right hand a heavy metal boxing glove
jason gets to his feet in time to see freddy cock the massive glove for a blow
dozens of spikes spring out of the metal glove
freddy swings knocking jason into the ropes
he bounces off and falls to the mat
the fans go nuts
as jason tries to get up freddy swings his right arm around and around the metal boxing glove turning into a giant mallet
jason looks up just in time to see the mallet coming down
freddy drives jason into the mat
the crowd goes wild
from up in her cage meagan starts to scream jason
angle under the mat its a dark foreboding under water abyss
jasons legs kick trying to get back up
something slithers up from out of the deep
wisps of empty blackness clutching at jasons boots
freddy pushes down on jasons mask shoving him down
jason struggles but keeps slipping
this looks like the end of jason
youve got to get up
of freddy looking down at him pushing him down
young jason p
as he is being drowned
he fights to get to the surface
who it is
young jason breaks the surface for an instant and his killer comes into sharp focus
its freddy age
his camp crystal lake nametag reads hi
my name is freddy
he pushes the young jason down again laughing
freddy pushes jason down into the abyss below the mat
laughing when jason snaps
with a burst of strength he kicks upward coming up out of the mat
jason grabs freddy by the throat and seizes him up with him
jasons momentum carries both of them up to the ceiling where they crash through to
jason wakes up holding freddy by the throat as he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above the studio
a light explodes and freddy cries in pain
then realizes hes been brought into the real world
jason throws freddy to the ground then raises up a boot and stomps freddys head squashing it like a tomato
the dream demons squirt out
just then the cultists break down the studio door
they raise their weapons to fire when their heads suddenly implode
they fall screaming to the floor dead
the remaining cultists shooting it out with the police suddenly grab their heads screaming
their heads implode and they fall to the ground
murdoch sees this and says to the s
commander nows my chance
give me sixty seconds to get in there then move in
before the commander can reply murdoch is off and running into the station
meagan and lizzy come out of their sleep like trance and embrace
then meagan looks up at erwin
what took you so long
erwin gestures to jason trying to keep his voice low so as to not hurt the big guys feelings
what ever you do
dont let this guy drive
meagan smiles at jason
i knew you would come
jason and meagan look over to where freddys body is fast decaying
turning back into blackened bones scraps of cloth and a rusting glove of knives
the dream demons squirm around on the studio floor then swim into the open end of the camera cable and disappear
in the control room freddys face appears on every monitor laughing
freddys in the transmitter
erwin watches as an electrical freddy impulse races from the control room via a long thick cable running overhead
continuing hes going for the satellite dish
if he uplinks with a communications satellite he can beam himself any where in the world
well never be rid of him
meagan and jason look up at the freddy impulse shoots past them going through the ceiling to the
the satellite dish mounted on the roof
it begins to pulsate with an olive and red glow getting ready to beam freddy
meagan reaches up and grabs the cable pulling it hard
the roof gives way tilting the big dish just as it blasts the laughing freddy beam into the night sky
the freddy beam just misses the satellite ricocheting off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite tumbling into deep space
the deflected freddy beam now zooms towards the sun
inside the beam freddy sees the sun zooming up and screams
his face burns away leaving a screaming skull
that too burns away leaving the dream demons
one by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun
angle on the sun as the beam explodes causing a solar prominence
the ceiling collapses in on jason burying him under a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish
a ton of dust billows up
just then murdoch bursts in
he sees lizzy and meagan and takes aim with the shotgun
erwin sees this and jumps in between them yelling no
the shotgun blast knocks erwin across the room where he lands in a heap
meagan and lizzy run to his side
erwin struggles to breathe a large hole in his chest
with fading strength erwin pulls his pin out and pricks himself
erwin smiles and dies
and so are you if you dont put your hands up right now
lizzy turns and attacks murdoch
he knocks her to the floor taking aim on her head with the shotgun as he says continuing its time i taught you girls some respect for the law
in a panic meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen cultist and fires it at murdochs head
murdochs hat goes flying off with a spark hit revealing his bald hideous head a large open wound with a metal plate underneath
he turns towards meagan with an evil grin on his face
you wanna be a punk
murdoch raises the shotgun taking aim on meagan
continuing then die like a punk
murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when jasons hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him
jason jams his hand down the back of murdochs pants and pulls up his briefs lifting him a foot off the floor with a jason wedgy as he rises from
we see murdochs name written into his shorts
as murdoch screams jason jerks the shotgun from his hand and jams it up his ass right through the seat of his pants
murdochs cheeks bulge out as the muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth
jason cocks the shotgun and
murdochs head and shoulders explode from his torso leaving his broken spine sticking up out of shirt
bits of murdoch splatter the floor as his metal plate comes pinging down rolling around and spinning to a stop like a hubcap
jason drops murdoch whats left of him to the floor just as the s
commander and his men come charging in
they see jason and raise their guns in panic
the cops let loose with a barrage of gun fire
bullet hits explode on jasons chest
meagan grabs lizzy and covers her up as the bullets whizz past
more cops hear the shooting and come running
they start shooting too
soon the doorway to the studio is crowded with muzzle flash
more and more bullet hits smack jason
a bullet hole outline appears on the wall behind him
the cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes up more ammo
various inserts of cops going for hideout pistols opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the cops in the studio
jason keeps getting shot
pieces of his are flying off
fingers shot off of a hand
a knee shot away to reveal the bone
dozens of bullet hits going off of his chest and head
finally the cops start to run out of ammo
the shooting subsides and finally grinds to a stop leaving the cops knee high in brass and a thick layer of gunsmoke in the room
as it clears jason still stands
he teeters a little then falls backwards with a mighty thud
jason lays dying
meagan rushes to his side
jason reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and pulls something out jesses heart
jason hands the heart to meagan
then jasons head rolls back hes dead
meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio revealing her surrounded by jason freddy and murdoch
meagan tucks lizzy into her bed
she gives her the raggedy ann doll and kisses her goodnight
as meagan turns out the light lizzy asks you forgot to check under the bed
meagan clucks and bends down peering under the bed nada
no monsters here
but what if they come back
then well just have to kick their ass again
i love you meagan
i love you too
go to sleep
as meagan crosses to her room her parents call up to her from the bottom of the staircase
meagan looks down at her parents
your mom and i
well we want to thank you for saving your sisters life
we know you went through a lot
were going to be there for you from now on
for both of you
and that nice lawyer we hired for you said he thinks he can get all the charges dropped
except maybe for the grave robbing and human desecration ones
everything is going to be fine
and im going to get sober
were going to be a normal happy family again
meagan is ready for bed drawing back the covers when the phone rings
she picks it up
filtered ill be seeing you in your dreams
freddys nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and licks meagan in the face
she yelps and slams the phone down
sighs i know
meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it
she climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal the pistol erwin gave jesse to kill freddy
she smiles and puts the pistol back under the pillow
the phone rings
at the very end
ted bundy and all the spectators are looking up at the hole in the ceiling that jason and freddy made when they went back to reality
finally somebody says i dont think theyre coming back
every body can go home now
all the monsters get grumbling and start to exit
now its over
