written by ivan raimi sam raimi september year old stephanie browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep as the alarm clock buzzes
she hits the snooze button and plops back down onto the pillow
after a few seconds of pure sleeping bliss she wills herself up
she moves through her ikea furnished bedroom past a hang in there baby poster and into the bathroom
stephanie turns on the shower
while waiting for the water to heat up she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated pronunciation recites there is no friction with proper diction
good sounds abound when the mouth is round
she catches herself on the last word a hint of missouri twang slipping through
she slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the steaming shower
she opens the refrigerator a half grapefruit sits next to an inviting slice of chocolate cake
shes tempted but chooses the grapefruit
a sunny southern california day
commuters speed by
stephanies ford focus pulls into the parking structure across the street from the bank of california
she steps from the car smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward the intersection
the traffic signal changes to dont walk
a business man next to her sprints across the street
stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign
she looks down to see a little kitten
it rubs against her ankles and purrs
well youre a little cutie
a cars horn blares spooking the kitten
it darts into the intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming van
stephanie races into the intersection snatches up the kitten and places it safely down on the other side of the street
the van roars past
she pets the kitten
it purrs and licks stephanies face
she sets it down
go on home
she heads for the bank
the kitten follows
she turns back frowning
stephanie site at her desk across from a young mexican couple
she studies their mortgage
we keep getting the same thing
because im not employed by an american company they wont take my application until they get my solvency statement
and the mexican treasury department says thats going to take at least four more weeks
and the house will be gone by then
it says here your employed by pemex
isnt pemex a subsidiary of union oil
a mexican man yes
so technically your employer is an american company
i think we can make this work
ill call you this afternoon and let you know
the happy couple shake stephanies hand and exit
ellen stephanies pretty twenty two year old roommate flops down into the seat across from her
i need clarification on the shoe issue
first of all you know youve got the only perfect pair of black dress shoes in l
so was that a definite irrevocable no way or t just a rather not at this time no way
its an absolutely positively forget about the shoes already no way
theyre my only good pair and i need them in good shape for tomorrow
dinner with rays parents
ellen picks up a desktop photo a shot of stephanie and her handsome boyfriend ray locked in an embrace standing in the spray of a waterfall
rays got a nice butt
really tight stephanie takes back her photo
hes a keeper
but i told you about his mom shes another story
i used to waitress at her country club and with her its all about what private school you went to and who you know
you still up for that promotion
that would help
stephanie looks longingly to
of the former assistant manager
the large oak desk
the executive chair
waiting to be filled
stephanie turns back pushing the thought away
im not putting on a show
shell either accept me for who i am or not
are you reading self help books again
the kitten peers out through stephanies partially opened desk drawer
ellen reaches for the kitty but stephanie waves her off
shhhl i cant let my boss see him
stephanie glances to her manager mr
jacks a heavyset man sitting behind a large desk
what about the shoes
i told you
now beat it
jacks sneezes rubs his nose
he looks suspiciously about the bank for the source of his allergy
you better bring the kitty home for me
if i can take the shoes
i told you no
jacks sneezes again his eyes water
he turns to his has someone brought a damned animal into my bank
jacks looks about the bank his twitching nose leading him toward stephanies desk
take the shoes
hidden from mr
jacks view ellen quickly scoops up the kitten and places it into her purse
jacks arrives at stephanies desk he overhears just dont expect me to take care of it
this catches mr
he turns to the ladies wondering what theyre talking about
stephanie takes ellens hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye
of course not
ill take care of everything
and thanks for choosing bank of california
ellen plays along
then ill see you later
i mean whenever the next time im in the bank
you know for a loan
as ellen passes mr
jacks sneezes again harder
someone has definitely brought an animal in here
he eyes ellen suspiciously as she exits
i dont see any cats
or any animals
hope to hell not
by the way i put the paperwork for the mcpherson loan on your desk
that big corporate loan ive been trying to set up
its just preliminary but oh right
ill look it over when i get the chance
jacks i was wondering it you had made any decision regarding the assistant managers position yet
im still deciding
right now its between stu and yourself
stephanie turns to see stu the balding loan officer who sits at his desk watching trying to figure out what jacks is saying to her
i know hes new but hes also quite aggressive and we like that
dont get me wrong youre well liked here but were also looking for someone whos not afraid to crunch the numbers and make the tough decisions
jacks i feel that im perfectly capable of ill let you know as soon as i decide
in the meantime take him through our loan qualifying procedures
just in case
and would you mind taking your lunch now
and on your way back maybe you could bring me a turkey club
stu overhears them as he passes by
excellent choice j
then to stephanie mind picking one up for me
jacks heads back toward his desk
stephanie grabs her purse and keys and as she heads out stu calls after her on toasted rye
and spicy mustard
stephanie doesnt like fetching lunch for the trainee but hides her displeasure
stephanie enters the ivy covered red bricked department of psychology building
ray dalton a handsome twenty nine year old man is lecturing before a class of ucla students
they listen attentively
the conscious mind abhors uncertainty
it seeks a pattern or reason for everything
when we cant find that pattern or reason we sometimes ascribe its cause to the world of the supernatural
the spiritual world is created by the human mind to conveniently explain everything we cant
so when does a belief in the supernatural cross into the field of abnormal behavior
where do you the psychologist come in
when these beliefs negatively affect our patients activities of daily living
their jobs their friends their sense of well being the class bell rings
tomorrow well be covering the clinical manifestations of psychosis
youll find it all t referenced in the text
the students pack up their books
ray smiles as he sees stephanie enter the lecture hall holding a bag of deli food
stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement of the mcpherson corporation
ray grades papers
howre things at the bank
hows that new position looking
i dont know
you sounded so sure
well now theres this new guy
theyre considering him too
ray sees how bummed out she is
he moves close taking her in his arms
that job needs somebody with your experience
they know that
oh ive got something for you
she rummages through her purse and hands ray an envelope
he removes a coin
an old nickle
a indian head
hey good find
whered you get it
one of the tellers found it for me
ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into his pocket
id better get back to work
she quickly gathers her things
ray returns to grading his students exams
the telephone rings
ray hits the speakerphone
its the voice of an older woman trudy
hi mom can you hold on a sec
he turns from the phone whispering to stephanie ill call you tonight
she kisses ray and exits
stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink
just had lunch with stephanie
and trying to get these midterms graded she halts as she hears her name mentioned on rays speakerphone
she moves closer to rays office to eavesdrop stephanie
the one from the farm
you know who she is
shes coming over for dinner tomorrow night to meet you and dad
ray im sure shes sweet but she doesnt sound
i mean shes just a teller at some bank right
raymond theres a reason that your father and i raised you in a certain way
we have expectations
please mom not this again i heard that julie kulick is looking for someone to play tennis with
you know she graduated yale law with honors
im told shes quite a successful attorney now
i gave you her number but her mother says you never called
because im with stephanie
im not looking for anybody else
would it kill you to mom
i have to go
see you tomorrow night
a downhearted stephanie quietly exits
as stephanie pours herself a cup of coffee stu and mr
jacks take the first bites of their sandwiches
stu makes a face
he inspects the sandwich shakes his head
quietly to mr
jacks she messed up my order
stephanie heard that
no i didnt stu
steph i said no mayo
you never said that
stu rolls his eyes to mr
stephanie caught stus look but what can she do
stephanie sits at her desk entering data into her computer
she glances across the bank to see stu and mr
jacks emerging from the break room
stu is about to return to his desk when he remembers something hes got two tickets to a dodger game that he cant use
jacks happily accepts the tickets
stephanie looks to the vacant office of the assistant manager
she can feel her promotion slipping away
stephanie looks to the source of the sound
a withered hand
an involuntary tremor causes its yellowed fingernails to scratch across the surface of stephanies desk
the hand belongs to mrs
sylvia ganush the aged woman who site across from stephanie
she wears a
formal dress and hat from another era
the outfit is threadbare in spots but great care has been taken to maintain it
hungarian accent will you help me
what can i do for you
ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen handkerchief which she tucks back into her puree
she hands stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers
stephanie reviews them
the old woman nods
this is a delinquency notice
it says that the payment on your loan was due a number of months ago
and this other document
is a court order for repossession
the bank is informing you of their intent to repossess your property at brandon street tomorrow
the trucks are there now
the men are packing all my things
please make them stop
this is my home for twenty years
and i make every payment until the sickness took my eye
ganush turns her head to reveal a milky white eye
stephanie hides her revulsion
do you have the payment with you now
i hope to get it soon
i just need a little more time
i dont think my manager is going to extend you anymore credit
id like to help but
wont you try
stephanie stands and moves off
the old woman picks through a bowl of hard candies on stephanies desk
stephanie stands before mr
he acknowledges her without looking up from his work
ive got an elderly woman asking for an extension on her mortgage payment
theyre in the process of repossessing her home
shes on a fixed income and shes had some medical problems
i was wondering if we could give her a break
stephanie hands mr
jacks the loan file
he puts on his bifocals studies it
stephanie glances over her shoulder
ganush looks around to
make sure no ones watching then tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse
into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she wraps in her linen handkerchief
she places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it with a wet sucking sound
the old womans one good eye wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat
apparently weve already granted her two extensions
and you know on this type of foreclosure the bank makes a sizable amount in fees
he hands her back the file
it would mean id have to throw her out of her house
he leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies her
stephanie glances to the vacant office of the assistant manager
the large oak desk
the thick carpet
she sees a calculating stu rubin eyeing her from his workstation
ill take care of it
stephanie returns to her desk
ganush another extension on the loan is out of the question
please its my home
im begging you
i tried to talk my boss into it but he just wouldnt approve
but where will i live
stephanie leafs through the loan documents
she finds a name
ganush youve given your granddaughter as a reference
it says here she lives nearby
wouldnt you be better off living with her
i would not burden her
okay well theres several fine assisted living facilities for the elderly
a nursing home
i will never live in one of those places well of course thats your choice
im sorry theres nothing i can do
ganush begins to sob
i am proud woman miss brown and never have i begged for anything
but i will beg for you now
this one time
i humble myself before you
that isnt necessary please
lets not make this personal
its just the banks policy
im really sorry mrs
stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly into a manila folder
she glances up but mrs
ganush is gone
stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old woman kneeling before her
she clutches stephanies leg with her gnarled hands
have mercy on me
stephanie stands tries to pull free but the old woman will not release her leg
please let go
customers turn to look
jacks glances up from his desk
what the hell
i sylvia ganush beg
on my mothers grave i beg you
please take your hands off me
but the old woman only clutches tighter
im calling security
she picks up the phone and presses a button
into the phone could you please come over
ganush finally releases her grip and bows her head in humiliation
you shame me
she composes herself
then slowly stands puffing up her chest
mu tering her damaged pride
i begged you
good eye fixes its hardened gaze upon stephanie
and you shame me
ganush suddenly grasps stephanies arm
stephanie tries to pull away but the old ladys grip is strong
ganush reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from stephanies wrist but the security guard intervenes
i think your business here is finished maam
the guard escorts mrs
ganush from the bank
through the bankss window stephanie watches the guard lead mrs
ganush to a old chevy cavalier on the street
stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up the old womans car is gone
the bank is closing
stephanie is finishing some paper work when mr
jacks stops by her desk
that was one nutty old lady
you handled that just right
and by the way as far as the assistant managers position
youre at the top of the list
jacks nods heads for home
stephanie loads a pile of contracts a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box and exits the bank
the security guard locks up behind her
stephanie waves as the last of her co workers drive off
its then that she notices the battered chevy caviler
its parked in the structure
stephanie looks closer
theres no one behind the wheel
she nervously glances about
no sign of mrs
stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car
her footsteps echo in the deserted structure more loudly than she would like
she arrives at her car and quickly gets inside locking the doors behind her
she places the box of contracts on the seat next to her
as she starts the engine she notices a strange sight something moving skimming along the surface of the lot
ganushs linen handkerchief
it whisks about like a ghost swirling closer and closer
stephanie watches transfixed as it flies right toward her car
it dips beneath her hood and is gone
it suddenly sweeps up into view flittering up over her windshield and is carried off by the wind
stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled hands come up around her face
mrs ganush sits up in the back seat of her car
shrieking with rage at stephanie
in hungarian you bitch
i pluck out your fucking eyes
ganushs razor sharp fingernails lash out towards stephanies eyes
but stephanie grabs the old womans wrists halting her
the withered hands drop down to wrap around stephanies throat
stephanie fights for breath as she frantically searches for a weapon
her hand finds the box on the seat next to her
she grabs a handful of colored push pins and jams them into the old womans arm
ganush releases her grip
stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before mrs
ganush grabs two fistfuls of stephanies hair
the old woman yanks upon it
stephanies head is pulled back over the edge of the seat
ganush braces her feet against the back of the front seat to pull even harder
stephanies neck is now bent so far back its about to snap
stephanies hand finds the stapler trips the release
it springs open
she swings it back over her shoulder
with each blow she delivers a staple into mrs
a lucky shot the old ladys white eye is stapled shut
the old woman howls but her grip on stephanies hair only tightens
stephanie about to black out throws the car into gear and hits the gas
as the car accelerates stephanie fastens her shoulder harness with the last of her strength
the old womans stapled eyelid pops open just in time for her to see
an oncoming concrete column
stephanies car slams into it
stephanie is held fast by her shoulder harness
ganushs body hurtles forward over the front seat impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force
close shot of the old womans head slamming into the dash
in a spray of broken teeth her dentures eject from her mouth
both women are dazed from the impact
stephanie regains her wits first
she reaches across mrs
ganush and opens the passenger door
ganush stirs but before she can come to stephanies foot shoves her out
the old woman hits the ground hard but she sits up suddenly with a snarl and starts to climb back in
stephanie shifts the car into reverse
the opened passenger door knocks mrs
ganush back down to the pavement
the cars rear bumper slams into a concrete column
stephanie is dazed
ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the car
stephanie tries to focus
a blurred image in the rear view mirror mrs
ganush running closer shrieking with old world rage
the old woman reaches for the opened passenger door but stephanie closes it and locks it just in time
ganush furiously pulls on the door handle to no avail
i beat you you old bitch
next time take your geretol
the old woman bends down beneath stephanies view
stephanie looks about
whered she go
the old woman pops up into view raising a chunk of concrete and
crashi stephanie screams as the window shatters
the old womans head juts into the cart she clamps her toothless maw down upon stephanie
suckling it gumming
the old womans good eye rolls about in ecstacy
stephanie shrieks as she pushes the slobbering head away
strands of spittle form a bridge from the old womans mouth to ste phanies jaw
the old womans wrinkled hands grope about the front seat
she finds her dentures now damaged from the fight
she grunts as she jams them back into her mouth
she comes at stephanie mouth wide open and shrieking
stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and shoves it down the old ladys throat
ganush gags trying to retch up the ruler
then stephanie is suddenly screaming herself as the old woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car
stephanie hits the pavement
she shields her face with her hands waiting but the blow never comes
the old woman standing above her wheezing
you shamed me
the old woman reaches down
ganushs gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of stephanies coat
she waves the button through the air and breathes out a single word lamia
clouds move past the setting sun
a shadow falls over stephanie
a cold wind makes her shiver
what are you doing
stephanie sits up reaching for her button
but the old woman moves it out of reach
you want it
stephanie snatches the button back
ganush smiles cryptically as stephanie stuffs the button into her coat pocket
soon it will be you who comes begging to me
it begins tonight when you hear the cry
its coming for you
a large black buzzing fly lands on stephanies face
she swats it away
her vision blurs and she grows dizzy
she leans against the car for support
when she finally looks up mrs
ganush is gone
stephanie and ray have just finished filing a report with what about a restraining order
well thats usually only something we do if theres a pattern of harassment
but like i said well file a report and keep it on record in case you do have a continuing problem
but once we send an officer around to have a word with her i dont think shell be bothering you again
thank you youve been very helpful
stephanie and ray eat ice cream cones as they walk past the shops
i just thank god youre okay
you are okay right
ray waits sensing that theres more to it
your fine but
i its just that i could have gotten her another extension
but i didnt
you said the bank had already granted her two extensions
ray contd when you dont pay your mortgage you lose your house what did she t expect
he wraps his arms around her protectively and after a moment they walk on
stephanie watches wistfully as a young couple coo over their baby
behind the couple stephanie notices a neon sign in a storefront window
it reads psychic
lets get our fortunes read
youre kidding right
she cajoles a protesting ray through the front door of the establishment
a tiny waiting room
a poster on the wall indicating the energy meridians of the human body
i just hope to god none of my students see me here
five bucks says hes wearing a turban
a beaded curtain parts revealing
rham jas a small dark skinned fifty year old indian man
he wears a plain black suit and a white turban
his inquisitive eyes evaluate the couple
i am rham jas
how do you do
im stephanie brown and this is ray
but you probably already knew that
rham jas gives ray a tight smile
how can i help you
wed like to have our fortunes read
can you do that
read the future
i have the ability to see certain energies
sometimes these energies are a foretoken of things to come
sixty dollars please
isnt that a little steep for this kind of thing
there are many who would claim to be seers
but they are not
although you would pay them little
you would receive nothing
are not serious go
rham jas turns to depart through the beaded curtain
she removes some bills from her purse but ray waves her off handing rham jas a credit card
he swipes rays card through the credit card machine
int rham jass back room night a sparsely furnished dimly lit room
the walls are lined with old books
rham jas stands before stephanie and ray who sit at a card table
stephanie giggles with excitement
rham jas smiles back
thats quite all right
so you wish to know something of your destiny
we shall see what the fates have in store
rham jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains
freud said destiny was not an act of fate but rather something created by our subconscious to control our conscious choices
that is true
we should not pretend to understand the world only by intellect
from his treatise psychological types
ray studies this strange man as he strikes a match and lights a candle
theres more to him than meets the eye
ray brushes it off
jung the new agers favorite psychologist
because he wasnt afraid to bring god into the equation
rham jas takes a seat at the table across from stephanie
your hand please
stephanie extends her hand to rham jas
he closes his eyes and concentrates
stephanie smiles excitedly to ray who raises a skeptical eyebrow
you work with money
youve lost something
i dont think so
no youre right
somethings been taken from you
no i rham jas grabs her arm and turns it revealing the threads
that once held the button on her coat sleeve
some old woman
well anyone can see she lost a button
but ray it was very strange
at the bank today
the old woman
the one i told you about
she plucked the button right from my sleeve
why would she do that
if you would please both be quiet
rham jae concentrates his eyelids flutter
stephanie appears uneasy
the flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze sweeps through the room
the wind chimes tinkle
ray pulls his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air
rham jass back stiffens
he releases stephanies hand and stands
he moves away from the table uncomfortable
with a handkerchief he dabs perspiration from his brow
i think that is enough for now
you saw something
im tired and i see its become quite late
of course i will refund your money
rham jas hesitates then
a bad spirit has come upon you
did you blaspheme the dead while visiting a grave site
do you play with ouija board or confer with those who practice the black arts
what is this
no i didnt
then perhaps someone has cursed you
rham jas turns her wrist exposing the loose threads on her coat sleeve
where the brass button once was
ray and stephanie cruise along the dark winding hills
ray looks over at stephanie
how did he know all that
that you lost a button
he makes some good guesses stirs you up leaving you with a lot of questions
and conveniently his business card
cmon hes a scam artist
he didnt want the money
he tried to give the money back
in the end he took it didnt he
i guess so
ray and stephanie step from the car
they open a rusting iron gate and walk up the hilly path to stephanies slightly funky silver lake rental house
ray and stephanie step inside
the kitten purrs around stephanies feet
ray picks it up
so this is him
got a name
just kitty so far
she takes the cat from ray cuddles it
sure you dont want me to spend the night
dont tempt me
ive got to prep a presentation for the morning
ray kisses her opens the front door and exits
he calls back to her from his car remember dinner at my folks house tomorrow night
were supposed to bring desert
i could pick something up
im planning on baking my special cake
try not to stay up too late
ray waves and steps into his car
stephanie watches him drive off
stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas entering financial data into her laptop
an episode of desperate housewives plays in the background on tv
a baking timer chimes
stephanie removes a beautifully browned cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool
her roommate ellen comes down the stairs snuggling the kitten
isnt he adorable
lets hope the landlord thinks so
she sets down the kitten and picks up her overnight bag
what about you
you going to be okay
you know i dont have to go out tonight
no im fine
have a good time
do i look great
you look great
ellen smiles grabs her car keys and heads for the door
isnt that marcis dress
and if she calls tell her not to go bi polar on me illget it back to her by tomorrow
or the next day
stephanie places butter into a mixer for the cake frosting
through the kitchen window we can see ellen walking down the path toward the street
she steps through the iron gate latching it closed behind her
ellens car pulls away
the wind kicks up whisking leaves about as though something where moving up the path and toward the front gate of the house
an unsettling shriek
what the hell was that
stephanie sets down the measuring cup
she moves to the front door
she looks out the kitchen window
gate is now open
it shrieks as it swings back and forth in the wind
suddenly the latch gives way and the windows swing open
wind sweeps through the kitchen whipping dead leaves about
the hanging pans bang together
stephanie forces the windows closed
the wind dies
the room grows eerily quiet
a car passes in the street below
its headlights sweep across the house
the headlight beams throw moving shadows on the wall
stephanie notices that one particular shadow is darker than the others
it becomes the silhouette of mrs
ganush but theres no one in the room with her
the car passes and the shadows vanish
sensing something the kitten arches its back
now stephanie feels it
the light bulb begins to sputter
she holds her breath listens
the floorboards creak
something is walking towards her
she spins around but theres nothing there
the sound of footsteps drawing closer
she backs against the wall trembling
suddenly stephanies face is struck by an invisible hand
she cries out
her mouth is bleeding
she runs for the door
shes almost there
her hand reaches for the knob when something unseen picks her up
she screams as she is thrown against the wall
she falls to the floor
lifting her head she catches her own reflection in the in the reflection as the light bulb flickers we see a flash of ghostly hands that grope at her body
they reach up through the floor and clutch at her legs buttocks and breasts
get off me
the phantom hands vanish
stephanie looks about eyes wild
stephanie is wearing rays overcoat atop her pajamas
she nervously paces the room
ray hurries in handing her a pack of frozen peas that she presses against her bloody lip
so she came to your house
this is crazy
im calling that police officer
he begins to dial but stephanie stops him
ray youre not listening
it wasnt her
it was something that she sicked on me
i dont understand
i didnt tell you the whole story
that old woman
after she knocked me down and pulled the button from my coat she told me that
she said that something was coming for me
and it did
ray stares at her with concern
doctor rangivertz wearing jeans and a ucla basketball sweatshirt concludes his interview with stephanie
he carries a small black medical bag as he steps from the living room to speak with ray
ray you were right to call me
never a good idea to be personally involved with your patient
what do you think
b medically shes fine
shes just very distraught
shes displaying some paranoia and a sense of panic
classic symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder
probably a result of being assaulted by that old woman
doctor rangavertz scribbles out a prescription and hands it to ray
how worried should i be
well have to wait and see
stephanie lays peacefully in bed almost asleep
a bottle of sedatives on the bedside table
ray pulls up the blanket around her exposed shoulder
stephanie sighs turns to him
how you doing
at the time it just seemed so real
im so embarrassed
dont be you had a terrible day and you
got a little wigged out
po what now doc
i was gonna surprise you but what the hell
ive been planning a little trip for us this week end
saturday morning were taking a train to santa barbara
my family owns a cabin up there
in the hills
overlooking this little river
well light a fire drink some champagne and screw our brains out
you sure know how to talk to a girl
its a chance to just be together
theres a lot of stuff i want to talk to you abqut but it never seems to be the right time
she draws in a deep breath and for the first time that evening she looks at peace
ray watches her as she closes her eyes and drifts off to sleep
tweeting birds and filtered sunlight streaming in through the window awaken stephanie
she stretches and looks to the empty pillow next to her
ray is gone
she tries to fall back asleep but the sound of a dripping faucet keeps her awake
frustrated she gets out of bed and steps into the bathroom
withered hands clamp around stephanies throat violently shaking her
you shamed mel match cut to ray shaking her
she awakens in her bed screaming
oh my god oh godl it was just a dream
she gets control
ray smooths out the tangled hair from her sweaty face
he looks deeply into her eyes afraid of whats happening to her
the phone in the next room rings
ray looks over decides to ignore it
it keeps ringing
ill be right back
he steps into the next room and we hear him answer the phone
stephanie sighs and lays back down
next to mrs
the old woman is covered in
a swarm of black flies
stephanie the old woman opens her maw exposing sharp broken teeth
she lunges for stephanie
stephanie grabs the old woman by her hair halting the chomping teeth inches from her face
she tries to push mrs
but the old womans yellowed teeth snap and press ever closer
the muscles in stephanies arms are trembling
she is weakening
ganush closes in about to clamp her teeth down upon stephanies face when stephanie suddenly awakens with a gasp
it was all a dream within a dream
she bolts up out of bed
takes her bearings
shes alone in rays bedroom
she checks the bathroom
under the bed
no oh my god
i had some dreams
want to tell me about them
the old lady
she was here
i couldnt wake up
stephanie shakes her head
she cant finish
ray pulls back the drapes
sunlight pours into the room
stephanie tries to put the dream out of her mind
ray sits next to her strokes her hair
doctor rangervertz said you could stop by his office during your lunch hour
rays car stops in front of the bank
stephanie looks across the street to the parking structure
her car is there
the window has been replaced
i had them replace the window last night
still needs some body work
thank you ray
she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath
weve got to be prepared that it might take some time for you to get over this
stephanie enters the bank
she guilty glancep to the clock
she tries to be discreet as she moves to her desk hoping mr
jacks wont notice
shes almost there when stu rubin accidently knocks a note book off his desk
jacks glances up and notes stephanies tardiness
stu approaches stephanies desk
just getting here
what are you the hall monitor
youre funny steph
what do you want
i need you to finish teaching me the loan procedures
ive got a lot on my mind
lets do it tomorrow
ill just tell mr
jacks that you dont have the time right now
maybe he can show me
she glances up
jacksis still watching her
no no thats all right
ill do it
where were we
we were going over the asset based lending guidelines
lets say your client is a company that cant get traditional bank financing but needs a secured loan
stephanie looks around for the source of the sound but cant find it
uh we offer several types of asset based lending which consist of revolving lines of credit and term loans secured by accounts receivables their inventory machinery stephanie sees
that stus hand has been replaced by mrs
its yellowed fingernails scratch across her desk
she looks again and stus hand has returned to normal
in her full missouri twang and get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk
stu is taken aback by stephanies outburst
he retreats to his desk in confusion
stephanie sits rattled
a drop of blood falls onto a piece of paper on her desk
the blood is trickling from her nose
stephanie grabs a tissue to halt the bleeding
she looks down to see a large black fly land upon the drop of blood
she gasps and stands her mind racing
she knows what she must do
she finds mrs
ganushs loan documents
she stuffs them into a folder grabs her purse and bolts for the exit
jacks engaged with a customer calls after her stephanie
where are you going
she moves quickly out the door pretending not to hear him
stu watches stephanie go and gets up from his desk
shes left some files behind
he snoops around his desk
he notices a folder marked confidential
its the mcpherson loan file
he picks it up
an old wood bungalow that has seen better days
a moving truck in the driveway
stephanies car pulls up
she steps out carrying mrs
ganushs loan documents
she passes the moving men who load the last of mrs
she arrives at the opened front door gathers her courage and knocks
she calls out mrs
she steps inside
its dark and musty here
the place is barren but for some flattened cardboard boxes
stephanie tries the light switch
she moves forward into the living room
its too dark to see much of anything
stephanie stumbles over something left on the floor
a voice i knew youd come
stephanie almost jumps out of her skin
as her eyes adjust she sees mrs
ganush sitting on a crate in the corner of the room
her arthritic hands clutching a yellowed photograph
im here because i think i can help you
i can get your house back for you
its so empty now
i can arrange for all your furniture to be brought back
would that be okay
mrs ganush does not look up from the photograph
on behalf of the bank i just want to resolve this to your satisfaction
this whole thing got personal and there was really no reason for that
the bank made a mistake and i can fix it for you and in return id like you to cancel or call off whatever you
you know that thing you did to me
no hard feelings
my mother was a proud woman
thats what she had
waits an appropriate moment then places the document gently down on the floor next to mrs
all you need to do is
stephanie offers her a pen
and ill take care of the rest
ganushs hard eyes find stephanies
they bore in
im saying ill make things right
just sign this and you can keep the house
isnt that what you wanted
it was what i wanted before you shamed me
now i want to see you suffer
ive suffered enough
ganush suddenly erupts in a broken toothed cackle
just a crazy old woman
i dont even know why i came here
you know why
terrified stephanie runs from the place
the old womans cackling can still be heard as stephanie hurries to her car and drives off
stephanie site in her parked car
stephanie is eating from a package of double stuff oreos joylessly jamming one after another into her mouth
her eyes dart about who could help her
then she remembers something
she sets down the cookies and rummages through her purse
she finds the business card of rham jas
she starts the car and drives off
stephanie halts at a red light
out of the corner of her eye she sees something odd
stu rubin walking with two well dressed executives
the men warmly escort into the first national bank
whats he doing at first national
the car behind her honks
she drives on
stephanies car is parked in the street
stephanie stands before a counter facing rham jas
he swipes her credit card through the machine
she signs the receipt
he motions for her to follow him through the beaded curtain
back room of rham jass storefront day on a plain wooden table
a samovar brews a musty tea
rham jas is reading from an ancient text
he looks up from the book solemn
what did it sound like
it was awful
closes the book
that would be the lamia
the black goat
thats the word the old woman used
it is a nasty spirit
a taker of souls
a creature of misfortune for you and those around you
it is often summoned by the gypsies for their dour deeds
on the third day the lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object
something that the old woman took from you cursed then gave back
now it dawns on stephanie
she looks to the threads on her coat
stephanies hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket
the thin brass button in her palm
she holds the button up for him to inspect
but its presence makes him uneasy
he wags his finger back and forth
she lowers it
what if i just burn the thing
no matter what condition the button is in you would still be the owner
the lamia would still come to take you
take me where
rham jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text
she knows where
stymied she tucks the button back into her coat pocket
theres got to be something i can do
there are many ways to appease a spirit
the simplest is a blood offering
an animal sacrifice
a small creature would do
you could sacrifice a chicken
its all in here
rham jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he sets before her
im a vegetarian
im a member of peta for christs sake
i dont go around killing animals
you will be surprised what you will be willing to do when the lamia comes for you
she considers his words looks down to the book
close on a diagram of an animal sacrifice a creatures heart being cut from its body
camera pulls back to reveal that stephanie now site at her kitchen table reading the book
we see other diagrams the heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire
the burial of the smoking heart
stephanies kitten purrs as it rubs against her leg
stephanie closes the book shutting out the disturbing images
she hears the shriek of the rusty gate outside
she moves to the window and peers out
the rusting iron gate is open
stephanie senses a change in the room
shadows shift and grow deeper
the air is suddenly oppressive
something is coming
she moves to the front door and puts her ear to it
b but then she runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door
she can hear the sound of the scratching even here
she rushes to the phone picks it up no dial tone only high pitched static the sounds of the lamia buried within
she sets the phone down
for a moment all is quiet
should she go back down
then she hears a tiny squeaking
the knob on the front door turning
then the click of the lock followed by the creaking of rusty hinges as the front door swings open
she calls through her bedroom door
but its not ellen
stephanie puts her ear to the door
the sound of an animals hooves on wood
something is climbing the stairs
it stops outside her bedroom door
stephanie holds her breath listening
she sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door
i know that youre there
the window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening she ducks for cover
another window is blown inward and the glass sent her way
she screams and runs toward the bathroom door
it slams shut in her face
another window is shattered by the angry unseen thing
the force knocks her to the bed
the blankets are torn from the mattress throwing stephanie to the floor
the bedsheets whisk around the room flapping and twisting about like b drunken ghosts
she tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her into the air suspending her upside down taking her on a wild and harrowing ride about the
abruptly all the madness halts she drops to the floor
the bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her
whatever it was its gone
its quiet now
a terrified stephanie sits shaking in the wreckage of her room
with a trembling hand she jams a zagnut bar into her mouth and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor
she chases it with a double shot of makers mark whiskey
she removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts
she sings out in a sweet but trembling voice
here kitty kitty
here kitty kitty kitty
she moves closer until her face fills the screen
the distant scream of the kitten is heard
we hear it again and again until it is finally silenced
stephanie having been sick emerges from the bathroom wiping her mouth
stephanie throws something small and bloody inside the microwave oven and turns it on
she buries the heart in a corner of her garden
she turns on the garden hose washing the cats blood from the knife
stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes
didnt you hear me calling
i was looking all over for you
are you power eating clark bars again
cause theres about ten thousand wrappers all over the oh my god is that blood
stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden
but no blood shows
why would there be blood
right there on your sleeve
stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve
thats just tomato juice
i was inside making a salad and
i cut a tomato and i must have gotten it on my sleeve
ellen gives her roommate a worried look
look steph were friends so if somethings wrong
i had some problems
but i think everything is going to be good now
ellen isnt so sure
stephanie closes her bedroom door so ellen cant see the damage
stephanie cleans up the place
as she picks up some of her things she comes across an old photograph
closer its a photo of year old stephanie
she was obese
her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a h tee shirt
she stands before some barnyard animals a bucket of feed in her hand
stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self
she tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket
the music grows lighter as stephanie models a couple of dresses in front of ellen whos helping decide on the evenings wardrobe
go with the short skirt
what about this one
she hold up a longer more formal dress
that ones saying im trying to impress you with my conservative taste
but thats what i want it to say
ellen shakes her head no
stephanie takes a last look in the mirror decides to go with the short skirt
this is it
tell me again
the exact words he used
just that this little cabin would be a great place for us to really connect and that there was something hed been meaning to talk about with me
oh my god you are so engaged
ellens smile fades
she shakes her head despondently
i just know that robs never going to ask me
but i thought you said that relationship was only physical
oh id never marry a guy like that
but id still like him to ask me
stephanies car pulling up in front of rays hillside house
the convertible top is down and stephanie looks radiant in the golden sunlight
lets get a look at that dress
she steps from the car and models the dress
s you like i like
drive through the streets of bel air stephanie at the wheel
she tunes in a rock station and turns it up loud
she smiles at ray and takes his hand
she hits the gas and her ford focus opens up accelerating down a long tree lined street the wind blowing through their hair
stephanie and ray approach the front door
stephanie carries her home made cake
they ring the bell
stephanie suddenly seems apprehensive
its just that im not some ivy leaguer with an impressive resume
i have a feeling thats what your folks really want
but in the end its about what you and i want
is that so
ray gives her a reassuring nod
the front door opens revealing rays parents george and trudy dalton
behind them we glimpse an exquisitely furnished foyer
she kisses her son
stephanie this is my mother trudy and my father george
trudy glances at stephanies revealing cocktail dress with thinly veiled disapproval
stephanie self consciously tugs it lower
how do you do
nice tp meet you stephanie
its very nice to meet you too
please come in
she steps inside
you have a lovely home
ill get us something to drink
as george exits stephanie presents her home made cake to trudy
i hope you dont mind
i baked something for you
trudy hesitates then takes the cake from stephanie
its a harvest cake
isthat some kind of cake you make on a
we used to yeah when you have a lot of extra duck eggs
especially right before spring thats when you get a real dense yolk
makes for rich cake
the mother forces a smile
you must give me the recipe sometime
the real secrets in the milk
you want it unpasteurized
i mean unpasteurized
is that safe
and you want that milk still warm
straight from the cow
trudy has to stifle her gag reflex
george returns and hands ray and stephanie a cocktail
excuse me while i go find someplace to put this
as trudy takes away the cake a cat rounds the corner
it hisses at stephanie
she takes a step back
never could understand that damned animal
trudy returns from the kitchen
hecubas usually very sweet
i had a cat
what do you mean had a cat
what happened to him
how would i know what happened
you know how cats are
they come and they go
ray nods slowly
about to say something but lets it go
stephanie ray george and trudy are finishing dinner
still keeping up with your coin collection ray
i try to
in fact stephanie just found me a indian head nickel at her bank
so how long have you been working there stephanie
almost two years now
the job of a bank teller must be so difficult
id think with all the counting and the repetition itd become so tedious
yes youre right
but im not a teller
stephanies a loan officer in charge of small business and home loans
and shes on a fast track for a promotion
id like to think so
actually it depends
if i could close this big account that im working on it would really help
must be a very important loan
it would be the biggest that my branch has ever handled
howd it come to you
well i was reading the wall street journal and found this innovative medical supply company that was interested in expanding but didnt have the liquidity
i met with their cfo and presented a formula for restructuring some of their long term debt
it created an environment where i was able to offer them a rather attractive loan you sure sound like youve got a lot going for you stephanie
your mother must be very proud
i dont see her much
why is that
well ever since my dad died she doesnt talk much
she mostly stays on the farm and
keeps to herself
there is an awkward silence
does your mother have a drinking problem
cut her some slack mom she yes
im afraid she does
its nothing to be ashamed of
and i find your honesty refreshing
youve got back bone
not like that other girl ray brought by
what was her name
she was dreadful
so ill mannered
and no ambition
stage whisper to he found her through the internet
stephanie am i being too tough on ray
stephanie happy to be taken into the family circle winks at ray
not at all
thats what moms are for
thank you stephanie
maybe i will try that harvest cake of yours after all
trudy cuts herself a piece
stephanie tastes the cake and emits a tiny cough
she clears her throat
but the cough returns grows larger
just a little tickle in my she stands and takes a few steps away from the table
ray looks on concerned
are you okay
she waves him off clearing her throat
tries to smile demurely but erupts with a harsh cough
shes choking on something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her throat
with all her might she emits a bark and a large black fly buzzes out of her mouth
oh my god
the fly lazily buzzes across the table slowly circling trudys head
trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin
george lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean farm cake
ray is baffled too stunned to speak
stephanies gaze shifts to the kitchen door
from the other side she hears the sound of a hoofs
ray tries to cover for stephanie im so sorry stephanie
i dont know how that fly got
into your wait
whats that sound
trudy listens along with the others
they cant hear anything
but stephanie hears the footsteps drawing closer
im sorry i cant hear anything
mutters under her breath must be deafer than a post
but trudy heard that and takes offense
but before she can say anything a shadow appears at the base of the door
stephanie stands and shouts at it
leave me alone
just leave me the fuck alone
stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past trudys head
it shatters against the base of the door spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish
the shadow and footsteps are gone
ray rushes to her side
steph its okay
theres nothing there
she looks about
george and trudy regard stephanie as if she were mad
i think id better go
i think thats best dear
she heads for the door
ray starts to go after her but his mother stops him
let her go ray
shes a sick girl
she needs me
trudy grabs rays arm
im telling you not to go after her
ray gently pulls free of his mothers grasp and chases after stephanie
ray rushes outside stopping stephanie as she is about to get into her car
what did you see in there
you dont want to know
ray pulls her close
the thing thats coming for me
what the old woman sent
listen to me
what youre going through right now its like the doctor said its a stress reaction and no
i wanted to believe that but its real ray
you just dont want to open your eyes to it because it threatens you
because if im right and there is something out there then youd have to throw out everything you teach
and whered that leave you
like a plow without a mule
ray just stares at her
a long moment passes as he wonders if maybe she isnt right
unless youre willing to take a chance and believe in me i cant be with you any more
she steps into the car and drives off
ray watches her tail lights as they vanish into the night
an older home with bars on the front windows
stephanie knocks at the front door
she turns toward a distant sound a chilling high pitched squeal
was it just a buss air brakes
or something more
when stephanie turns back the door has been opened a crack
an eye peers out at her
what is it
i came to see sylvia ganush
is she here
the door opens wider revealing a sexy twenty four year old gypsy girl
bottle of beer in her hand long black hair earrings and a snake tatoo onher neck
she wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts
eastern european hip hop and laughter are heard from within the house
im ilenka sylvias granddaughter
who are you
a friend of hers
actually ive been trying to help her with a loan wait
i know who you are
grandma told me youd come
youre the woman from the bank
the one who took her house
it was really the bank that took the house
i just work there
in fact i tried to help your grandma get the house back but my boss wouldnt let me
ilenka knows shes lying
stephanie knows that she knows
thats not what happened is it
are you going to stand here on my porch and lie to my face
you used to be a real fat girl to didnt you
i can tell
you know you caused my grandma a lot of pain
that house was her pride
when you took that from her she had nothing left
youre not welcome here
she starts to close the door
stephanie halts her
desperate now no where else to turn
i did it
it was me who denied her the loan
i was trying to get ahead at work and i shouldnt have done it
it was wrong
damn straight it was wrong
and im ashamed about it
and im going to get down on my hands and knees and beg her to forgive me
she said that i hadnt suffered enough
but now i think shell see that i have and then maybe shell let me
make everything all right for her is that it
ilenka gives a bitter cryptic smile
she motions for stephanie to follow
they enter a room filled with young gypsies drinking smoking and talking loudly in a slavic tongue
a woman with a cane shouts as she throws a pair of dice
a hungarian man with a long braided ponytail curses his bad luck as he pays cash to the woman
where is she
ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers
stephanie t pushes her way through the crowd
she stumbles and falls atop the corpse of mrs
as per the custom of the gypsy wake there is no coffin just her dead body that rests atop a coffee table
stephanie has landed atop the corpse
the leg of the coffee table breaks under the weight of the two women
stephanie tumbles to the ground the corpse landing atop her
the crowd of mourners gasp
the dead womans opened mouth bobs up and down upon stephanies chin as through it were once again suckling it
stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in revulsion
still going to make everything all right
the mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table
ilenka addresses the crowd in hungarian
she tells them that it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother t from her home and that she now bears the curse of lamia
a mother shields her daughters eyes from the sight of stephanie the cursed one then hurriedly kisses her crucifix
a man spits at her feet then walks off
no please i needed her to take this thing off me
it will never come off
you know about it
then please help me
im begging you
she said youd come begging
i only wish she could have lived to see it
the blood drains from stephanies face
maybe she can
stephanie glances down to the corpse
its head is now facing her
its dead eyes open
stephanie puts her foot through rham jas tv set
shattering the tube commanding his
i paid you a hundred and seventy nine dollars for that book
it was a limited printing
please control yourself
i did what you said that blood offering
i killed that little kitty deader than hogans goat
lotta good that did me
we are dealing with elusive and powerful forces
there are no guarantees
she wants to shout but instead closes her eyes and sits
just tell me what to do
rham jas considers
a dark look crosses his face
stephanie tries to read his expression
its run through the carbon paper
rham jas hand her a receipt
she signs it
we must somehow dissuade the spirit from taking your soul
and it should be soon
for tomorrow will be the third night
have you done this before
but i know someone
i can arrange what is necessary but you must understand that everyone involved in this would be taking a great risk with their lives
what would you need from me
rham jas thinks for a moment weighing the dangers
he pulls out a pipe and packs it with tobacco
he tamps it down and lights up
twenty thousand dollars
stephanie is hastily piling all her valuables atop her bed sporting equipment tv vcr dvd combo cd player ipod etc
ellen enters rattled
i need to talk to you
this a bad time right now
i got a little emergency and
say you got any cash i can borrow
she starts stuffing the valuables into a large duffle bag
no i dont
but steph i what about your credit cards
whats your cash advance limit
stephanie contd ill pay you back
you know im good for it
steph we need to talk about the cat
where has that little rascal been
hes always running off have you noticed that
i was in the back yard and i saw where the ground was dug up
i started digging and
you buried that little kitty in our backyard
i didnt want to tell you
it fell out the window and died
its sad i found the bloody knife in the bushes
what are you a cat detective
im going to tell you this as your friend
there is something seriously wrong with you
stephanie looks up from her frantic panting
duhi im moving out
i cant live like this
stephanie angrily calls after her
an dont let the barn door hit you on your ass on yer way out
stephanie is speaking into a pay phone
i cant get the twenty thousand
youre gonna have to help me with what ive got
what do you have
she covers the mouthpiece speaking to someone off camera
camera pulls back to reveal that we arein a pawn shop
men haggle loudly in arabic over the price of a gold chain
the pawn broker stands before all of stephanies worldly belongings a toaster oven computer racing bike stereo microwave oven necklaces jewelry
thirty eight hundred for everything
including my jewlery
stephanie curses under her breath checks the balance on her checkbook does the math speaks into the phone six thousand
look ill give you six now and
there will be others involved and i cannot ask them to accept such a risk for less
he hangs up
the line goes dead
she tries to throw the phone but its attached with a short metal cord
she turns to the pawn broker
ill take it
stephanie thinks about how shell get the extra cash
she hesitantly dials a number on the pay phone
it rings and rings as she glances to a picture buried deep in her wallet a
the younger obese stephanie and her stern looking mother
both stand before a bleak snow covered mid western farm
hi its me
did you get the christmas card
yeah i guess it has been a while
listen im in kind of a fix here
ive been pretty sick and i need to borrow some money for an operation
i need fourteen thousand dollars right away
now i know you still have that pension fund at the credit union so yeah but
okay its just that i understand
the line goes dead
she slumps down against the pay phone
she pouts her lips in the mirror carefully applying lipstick
to reveal we are in the employee bathroom at the bank
she fixes her hair so its just right
straightens out a tiny wrinkle in her business suit smiles her best upbeat smile and exits the bathroom
stephanie approaches mr
jacks this is kind of awkward for me
i know its not official yet but i was wondering if i could get a copy of the employment contract for the new position you offered me
the assistant managers position
see one of my family members is having a little emergency which requires me to get them an immediate loan stephanie
theres a problem
the mcpherson deal was cancelled last night
yeah right after i informed the main branch that we had this big loan pending i find out that they just made their deal over at first national
i got a call in to see what exactly happened but right now this doesnt look too good for you or me
so this assistant manager promotion has been delayed
in fact i think that with everything thats been happening im gonna have to give that job to stu
stephanie is devastated
jacks sees tears begin to well up in her eyes
if youve got family problems
maybe you should take the day off and sort them out
stephanie node and exits the bank
as it ticks away the seconds
close shot the inadequate pile of cash that site atop stephanies kitchen table
stares down at the cash
her mouth mechanically opens to accept a large serving spoon of rocky road ice cream which she eats directly from the one gallon tub
the door bell rings
a moment later ray walks in
stephanie stands surprised
i paid rham jas but i thought you didnt believe
but you do
i know this is important for you
she embraces him
an old pasadena home site alone atop a hill
rays car drives up parks
are you coming in
i wanted to but rham jas said non believers werent welcome
i still dont like this
i know how crazy this must seem
but it will all be over after this i swear to you
she kisses him
ill call you when its done
ill be waiting
well laugh about it on the train tomorrow
stephanie steps from the car
ray drives off
she turns to face the old house
milos a thirty year old hungarian man leads stephanie into a large room with tall teak bookshelves and indian tapestries that adorn the walls
rham jas is seated in a wicker chair speaking with someone obscured by shadows
allow me the pleasure of an introduction
a woman rises from the shadows
shaun san dena the eighty year old woman smiles a toothless smile to stephanie
shaun san dena is an experienced medium
furthermore she has a personal knowledge of the lamia
i first encountered this spirit forty years ago in a small village outside of bucharest
i lost a young boys soul to the beast
i was an
inexperienced seer then
ive learned much since that woeful day
i have waited these long years for a chance at redeeming myself
a chance to destroy the foul thing
tonight my chance will come
but to summon it i will need your help
ill do whatever it takes
and the sooner the better
our business must wait till darkness falls
enough time for tea
a ceiling twenty feet high with massive windows covered by dark burgundy drapes
an ornate crystal chandelier hangs above a round table in the rooms center
stephanie rham jas shaun san dena and milos are finishing their tea
my late husband sandor was also a medium
he chose this site to build thehouse upon because he sensed certain energies that intersected here
shaun san dena contd he knew i would sense his spirit in this place as i have sensed others
it was to be our way of being together after he died
in earlier times it was a sacred place to the tuanteteck indians
and their stories told that the place was a burial ground of the old ones that inhabited the earth before them
here there is a particular alignment of energies
a confluence that allows doorways to be opened
through which we might pass
and through which others might pass into our world
milos removes the tea
it is time for us to begin
shaun san dena turns out the electric lights leaving only the tables candlelight for illumination
we hear the bleating of a goat
milos reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain
the goat catches sight of stephanie
it bleats in fear and attempts to run
but milos holds it fast and tethers it to a post
he moves to the table and lifts a velvet cloth revealing a large cattle slaughtering blade
lord jesus bless this knife and allow it to do your holy work
she makes the sign of the cross
she pours a
vial of holy water over the blade
she turns to stephanie
once the spirit has entered me place my hand upon the animal
do you understand
i will force the spirit of the lamia into the goat
milos thats when you strike
stephanie blanches but remains silent
we must all
shaun san dena begins to intone a romanian gypsy chant
stephanie leans close to speak quietly with rham jae
what do i have to do
you must allow the darkness in
you must invite the dead to co mingle with your spirit
now repeat these words
i welcome the dead into my soul
rham jae waits for stephanies response
shes shifts in her seat uncomfortably
i welcome the dead into my soul
you must believe it
stephanie takes a deep breath and they begin the chant again
this time together
i welcome the dead into my i welcome the dead into my soul
stephanie looks around the darkened room
shadows from the candles dance upon the walls
i sense something here with us
the parlors crystal chandeleir tinkles
a tea cup and saucer tremble for a moment
stephanies eyes search the room
emits a wheezing breath
we hear footsteps as something walks on the ceiling above them
echoes about the room
it is not the lamia
it is the spirit of some unsettled soul from years ago
the unsettled ones wait near the door
upon the table is drained
then the water is spat out in a stream at milos face
the mans laughter again
be gone foolish spirit
there is a howling of wind and the room is again quiet
show yourself lamia
we invite you into our circle
stephanie looks about
nothing seems to be happening
a faint sound
the scratching of fingernails on wood
a sound that stephanies heard before
it grows louder more distorted
stephanie grips the table
and just when the scratching sound is deafening
all becomes silent
stephanie holds her breath
a wind whips up in the room sending papers whirling about
yet all the windows are closed
shaun san denas eyes roll up into her head
she emits a low and powerful moan
her head slumps onto her shoulders
then she straightens with a new vigor
stephanie and rham jas watch as her lips move rapidly and a garbled sound comes out of her throat
she speaks in a strange and incomprehensible tongue
who now inhabits the body of shaun san dena
demonic voice lamia
rham jas nods discreetly to milos who quietly uncovers the slaughtering blade
lamia what is it that you desire
shaun san denas chair abruptly spins about to face stephanie
the mouth jerks opened and closed as if controlled by a bad puppeteer
then out of
sync the demonic voice is demonic voice the soul of stephanie brownl we will feast upon it as she festers in the gravel
it was my manager jim jacks
he was the one
lamia please surely we can dissuade you from taking this insignificant woman
surely shes not worthy of your greatness
the possessed shaun san dena laughs
demonic voice no
i will enjoy watching her skin blister and pop in hells flame
i come for her
stephanie quickly grabs shaun san dernas hand and places it on the goats head
shaun san denas eyes clear for a moment as she struggles to regain control
now there are two spirits battling within her
she attempts t to force the spirit of the lamia from her body and into the goat
the goat bleats and bucks wildly as the spirit is transferred
milos raises up the slaughtering blade
demonic voice no
you demonic voice tricked me
the possessed goat emits a terrible cry
the bone chilling shriek of lamia
its oval eye reflects the blade as it descends toward it
the possessed goat jerks aside and the blade misses slicing into the chair
as milos raises the blade for another blow the goat bites his hand
in that moment the spirit of the lamia is transferred to him
a possessed milos screams and spins toward stephanie glaring at her with black goat eyes
he shouts at her in a gibberish of tongues
his body jerks up into the air
he dances a jig atop the table now laughing uncontrollably
stephanie watches in horror
lamial i command you to leave this a chair sails through the air and shatters across rham jas back knocking him to the ground
milos body is hurled up against the chandelier shattering it
glass rains down upon stephanie
on the ceiling milos is spun
about like a pin wheel
stephanie races for the door but a huge bureau lurches in front of her blocking her path
rham jas rouses a stunned shaun san dena
you must banish the spirit
shaun san dena places her hands on her ayes then over her heart and chants an ancient gypsy incantation up toward milos
a white vapor streams from his body as the lamia is torn from him
in his normal voice stop the chanting
i beg you
but shaun san dena only chants louder
milos screams grow more intense as his body spasms in pain
stephanie grasps at shaun san dena
for gods sake stop the chanting its killing him
rham jas pushes her aside
you must not stop
a withered pair of hands reach down from above and clutch at stephanies face
it is mrs
ganush that now floats above her
her long yellowed fingernails scratching at stephanies skin
make her stop you dirty pork queen
get her off
ganush grabs at stephanies head
stephanie pulls away but it costs her a clump of hair that mrs
ganush rips from her head
ganush opens her mouth
she vomits out stephanies dead cat
it lands atop the table
stephanie screams uncontrollably
shaun san dena is trembling as her chanting comes to a climax
ganush changes back to the possessed milo
the last of the white vapor is torn from milos body as the spirit of the lamia leaves him
milos falls to the floor and all is quiet
an ashen faced shaun san dena halts her chant
is it gone
stephanie notices that the cat has vanished
was it ever there
rham jae kneels at milos side
hes starting to come around
milos stands shaken
the lamia is gone
shaun san dena grabs at her chest struggles for breath
stephanie rushes over to steady her
let me help you
shaun san dena collapses into stephanies arms
rham jas moves to assist her
they lower shaun san dana to the floor
milos call an ambulance
milos rushes from the room to call for help
rham jas checks for a pulse
shes not breathing
rham jas attempts to administer cpr to no avail
he checks her pulse one last time
the cpr is finally halted
rham jas closes her eyes then touches her forehead praying gata gata para gata
gone gone gone beyond
gone beyond the beyond
hail the goer
stephanie and rham jas watch as paramedics load the covered body of shaun san dena into the ambulance
they close the doors and drive away
its sad yes
strange how things work out
she waited years for another chance to overcome the lamia
and finally she did
im afraid you misunderstand
rham jas looks at her with pity
the lamia can notbe banished by a medium
this was our lesson tonight
but i saw her get rid of the thing
you saw her drive the lamia from the seance
that is all
it will be back
but then what am i supposed to do
rham jas shrugs
he fishes in his pocket for his car keys
perhaps on this final evening you should finish up the business of this world
for before the night is through the lamia will come for the owner of the accursed object
slowly emerges from her coat pocket
she studies the thin brass button in her palm
unless of course
you were no longer the owner
no longer the owner
i dont understand
rham jas reaches into his coat pocket and removes a blank envelope
he places the button within and seals it
the lamia comes for the owner of the accursed object
just make a gift of it
to demonstrate he hands the envelope to stephanie
and youve given away the curse
why didnt you tell me this before
because we are speaking of murder
stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to rham jas
she places the envelope carefully into the side pocket of her purse
rham jas tries to conceal the sadness and fear he feels for her
whatever you decide you have until sunrise
she nods goodbye as rays car pulls up
ray opens the door
for her and she gets in
ray and stephanie drive through the quiet pasadena neighborhood
is it over
stephanie stares at her envelope thinks about telling him then
its all over
ray squeezes her hand
appreciating the two of them now more than ever
stephanie screams as
appears in the headlights standing on the road before them
ray hits the breaks
the car screeches to a halt
stephanies purse with the envelope and
some of rays papers fall to the floor
are you okay
stephanie nods catching her breath
that guy came out of nowhere
stephanie looks to the figure in the road
ganush is gone
in her place is an old man who mutters angrily at them and moves on
rays bmw pulls up and stephanie gets out
are youstill okay about the santa barbara trip
yes everythings fine
our train leaves tomorrow morning
when do you want me to pick you up
its better if we meet at the d station
theres something ive got to do on the way
stephanie suddenly clutches at her purse
the envelope is gone
wheres my envelope
she opens the car door and frantically rummages around the floor through rays papers
its got to be here
then stephanie comes upon something under the seat
she smiles and stands
a white envelope held tightly in her hand
tomorrows gonna be a new start for us
dont be late
they kiss and ray drives off
the time is a
drinks coffee and stares at the white envelope thats tucked into the side pocket of her purse
she scans the patrons and considers giving it to each of them then one by one rejects the idea
comes by removes a dirty dish and refills her coffee
banana boat sundae
stephanie nods absently
the waitress exits
the time is now a
site alone at a table in a wheelchair
a portable oxygen cylinder supplying him with air
takes a deep breath stands and walks to his table
i wonder if you could help me out
the old man looks up sees her desperation
i just need you to hang on to this envelope for me
just until tomorrow
she extends the envelope to him
whats this all about
just take the envelope and ill explain
the old man considers
he reaches for the envelope when an old woman his wife hobbles toward the table
the old man helps her sit and puts away her cane
they turn to stephanie who withdraws the envelope
stephanie returns to her seat ashamed at what she almost did
she returns the envelope to the purse pocket racking her brains trying to think of some way out of this
her gaze lands upon a stack of newspapers on the next table
she grabs the paper and finds the obituaries
ganushs obituary a photo of the old woman
the location of the burial is listed oakwood cemetary
stephanie rips the listing from the paper and rushes from the restaurant
stephanie lit by a barren light bulb paces the room
rham jas in his pajamas studies an old leather bound text
is it possible
he closes the book and gives it some thought
there are gypsy blessings that are bestowed upon the dead
and the gypsies give gifts to their departed to curry favor with the deceased soul
i do believe you could give the curse to someone who has passed on
for truly the soul never dies
as she drives we hear the voice over from the preceding but you must make a formal gift of the cursed object to the deceased
car headlights sweep over her grim face
she fingers the envelope then glances to the seat next to her
give it to the corpse personally
put it in their hand
oh ill do better than that
camera moves in tight
ill shove it down her goddamn throat
she zips up her raincoat
something flits past the window
then it reappears
flies against stephanies windshield and gets caught on the wiper blade
it flaps in the wind blocking her view
stephanie hits the wiper button
the hankie is yanked back and forth across the windshield
she turns up the wiper speed
no sooner is it knocked loose than its whisked into the drivers side window
it slaps over stephanies eyes plastered there by thewind
the car swerves
her car crashes into a tree
stephanie pulls herself from the crash
she glances up to a flash of lightning
it illuminates the wrought iron gates of the oakwood cemetery
a hill of tombstones beyond
a light drizzle falls as stephaniesearches the graveyard for the burial place of mrs
she carries the shovel defensively ready to swat at anything that might leap out at her
she stops before a freshly dug grave
a temporary marker reads the name
shes scared now not sure if she can really go through with it
a church bell tolls five times
theres no time to think about it
stephanie looks around to make sure no one is watching then starts to dig
later its raining harder
the hole stephanie digs is now several feet deep
clunk the shovel has hit the buried coffin
the rain intensifies
later mud is pouring down the sides of the grave
in the bottom of the pit stephanie has unearthed the simple pine casket
she jams the shovel blade between two boards and pries off the coffins top and shoves it aside
a lightning flash illuminates the corpse
ganushs white eye is open and staring at stephanie
stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from her coat
im giving it back to you
she grabs mrs
ganushs hand and tries to get her clenched fist to open but rigor morris has locked it shut
stephanie pulls with all her might causing
to lurch up and out of the coffin
her dead arms thrown forward from the momentum wrap around stephanie
the withered face leers
stephanie pushes the corpse away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud
youll take it all right
she picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old womans mouth wedging it between her teeth
she pries the jaw open
mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into the grave from all sides
the body of mrs
ganush is quickly being re buried
i stephanie brown do hereby make a formal gift of this button to you sylvia ganush
she jams the white envelope down the old womans throat
choke on it bitch
she kicks the old womans jaw
it snaps shut trapping the envelope between her broken teeth
muddy water cascades down into the grave flowing over mrs
it covers everything except the jutting envelope and a single staring white eye
stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick
she grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it tears away unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up to her armpits
bobs up through the mud
the old woman is grinning with the envelope still jammed between her teeth
rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction
it has become the drain hole of the cemetery
pushes the old woman corpse against stephanie
her grinning face led mashed against stephanies cheek
stephanies scream is cut short as she and mrs
ganush disappear beneath the mud
the only sound is the pitter patter of rain
camera starts to pull away when
rips up through the mud grasping the tree root
breaks the surface of the mud sucking in air
she claws her way out then staggers away through the pouring rain
stephanie steps from the shower quickly towels her hair
she stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror
she has survived
the phone rings in the bedroom the machine picks up
sorry im calling so early but last night i found some troubling information about our friend stu rubin
a cleaned up stephanie her hair still wet from the shower drives the empty morning streets
a smile slowly comes to her face as we hear the rest of mr
apparently he stole your file on the mcpherson loan and then tried to broker his own deal at first federal
i guess he thought we wouldnt find out
when i confronted him he broke down crying and well we wont be seeing him around anymore
the eastern sky is growing brighter
stephanies car pulls into the lot
she removes a week end bag from her trunk and walks briskly toward the station
it looks like the loans coming back to us
and i just wanted you to know that come monday morning that assistant managers position will be waiting for you
stephanie is smiling as she enters the station
holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free samples to passersby
one is offered to stephanie
she politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her step
she stops at the window admiring a coat on display
she glances down at her own coat
notes the missing button
inside a saleswoman is preparing to open the shop
stephanie taps on the window shouts through the glass hey
the saleswoman opens the door a crack
im sorry were not open yet
i know what i want
that coat in the window
the saleswoman considers
my boyfriend and i are taking a very special trip this morning
stephanies smile is bright
her joy is contagious
the saleswoman relents and lets stephanie in
moments before sunrise the sky is streaked red
ray waits on the train platform clutching two tickets and a small garment bag
behind him other passengers arrive
from his pocket he removes a velvet case
he opens it and peeks t inside a diamond ring
he stows it back in his pocket
he looks for stephanie
then his face brightens as stephanie emerges from the crowd radiant in her new coat
ray embraces her and grabs her luggage
a train whistle sounds as the train approaches
is everything okay
im so glad youre here
theres so much ive been meaning to tell you
she takes his hand
but let me say this first while i have it straight in my head
you never stopped believing in me
ill try and live up to that
they share an intimate moment
a romantic kiss
he breaks off and smiles
did i tell you you look great
stephanie models her new coat
you like it
its brand new
whatd you do with your old coat
just the mention of it makes her face darken
i got rid of it
i never want to see it again
too bad cause i just found this
ray produces the envelope
and from it withdraws
the camera races into a huge close up of the button with a terrible clashing of symbols
stephanie cant breathe
yeah it was in my car
hey have you seen my indian head nickel
i put it in an envelope just like this one
stephanie stares at the button shaking her head in disbelief
the rumbling of the approaching train builds on the sound track
what is it
she backs away in horror but ray follows her with the button still in his hand
the rumbling grows louder
shes backing up toward the edge of the platform
ray steps forward still holding out the button
stephanie shrieks as she falls backwards off the platform and onto the tracks
in her last moment of life she turns her head to see
racing at her
through the swirling smoke the engines mechanical face resembles the goat like face of the demon lamia
it vomits steam as it angrily bares down upon her
stephanie recognizes the sound
its a cry shes heard before
in every door creak
in every cold night wind
a haunting soulless sound
the cry of lamia
ray races to the edge of the platform
the two lovers eyes find each other one last time
stephanie screams as the lamia swallows her and pulls her down into hell
believe they have witnessed a train accident but ray knows the truth
he looks to
still in his hand
a look of dread
finally he believes
