boatman john cusack registered wga address deleted for privacy phone deleted various extra close ups of this luxurious patchwork of brilliant greens pops up from the ground and begins to
water the already dew soaked lawn
no mother in sight cruise through the thrushes
at the bottom of a water hazard
after a neat they sway revealing the barren desert that surrounds the artificial oasis
the sun already bakes the air
we hear the opening guitar strains of the kim deal kurt cobain suet of what i did for love as we crane down the palms to just on the edge
of the rough
a pair of yellow trousers moves in
an iron confidently addresses the ball and chips it out
the trousers walk out after it
digging dirt out of the grooves of the irons face with a golf tee while on the way to the green
both hands are gloved instead of one and the gloves are black
in a squat over the ball sizing up the curvy fifty foot journey to the hole
the figure positions himself and the putter above the ball then pops the ball lightly
the ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole dodging hazards and finding lanes until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole
sets the ball on the next tee
the figure moves to a leather golf bag
the hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground reach into the bag drawing out a compact sniper rifle affixed
with a long silencer
the figure drops one knee down onto the rag the other foot firmly setting its spikes
we move the figure to see the face of the sniper concentrating down the scope in his half squat
he is martin blank
we swing around behind his head to look down the barrel with him
four hundred yards away on another part of the course another green is barely visible through groves of trees and rough
three miniscule silver haired figures come into view
one of them in a red sweater sets up for first putt
he could be an investment banker or an arms trader
flinches and a low thunk reports from the rifle
a second later in the distance the seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist
his body crumples to the green
returns the rifle to the bag pulls out a driver moves to the tee and whacks the ball
he watches its path and whispers absently
the outdoor post golf luncheon area of an elite texas golf club
martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between a group of executive types
club member has a buddha like peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk
id come to the realization that everything id based my life on was false
and that my life had no meaning
to martin he gets this way when he hits over eighty five
it seemed like my life was slipping away somehow
i was a knot in the middle of a wet rope
everything was futile and nothing had value
thats the way life is
the only meaning and value is what we create
through structure and discipline
though they seem to limit our freedom they actually give us great comfort
your problem is youre looking for some great answer
some ultimate truth
when what you really should do is go to work and go home
and take golf lessons
thats a tragedy
can i finish my story please
i began my search for meaning
i was a catholic jew scientologist sufi buddhist
i went to a psychologist psychiatrist herbalist nutritionist a shaman and a psychic
and they all pretty much say the same stuff
a jew a shaman and a herbalist are telling you the same thing
basically the same thing
in a very evolved esoteric way
to make a long story short
thank god at last i found the holistic system of systems that opened up the doors of heaven for me right here on earth
and everyday i see the world through the eyes of a child
a world of creation and wonder
overflowing with love
tell me about it
club member turns to martin
personal pan power
all the secrets of your universe are divided up into eight easily digestible slices
club member pulls a laminated card from his wallet and hands it over to martin
in the distance sirens begin to wail
its in the accessible and everyday shape of a pan pizza
each day you have a little slice of peace
a pizza shaped diagram showing six sections
oh i see
you got your individual slices of hope dignity confidence self love justice and harmony
you open em up and theres the sayings stories little bites of insight
its the p
six day week
so you eat read it everyday
and these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven
re the card thats for you
sirens are getting louder closer to the club
the source of the sirens are almost upon us
martin walks toward his rented town car as the valet pulls it up
he meets the valet by the trunk where he trades tip for keys
he fishes out the laminated personal pan power card looks at it and tosses it onto the ground
police cars now visible in the distance wind into the long club driveway
martin gets into his car and pulls away
as it lays on the asphalt
the wheel of a police car rolls to a stop on it
martin sits in a first class seat the tray table flipped down
on the left side of the tray is a stack of magazines of all kinds sports illustrated mademoiselle wired rolling stone national review spin national geographic and on
he draws one off the top and flips through it impassively taking in images and reading nothing
when he is done with one he discards it into the empty seat next to him and draws another martins way of instantly and massively uploading the world around him
toothless hockey player in triumph sony product parade crouched starving child with vulture in the background supermodel in suede tic tacs living former presidents arm in arm smiling etc
the livery weaves out of the arrival lanes at kennedy airport
martin reclines in the back seat a conversation having already begun
how was your day today sir
but to tell you the truth ive lost my passion for work
do you like the people you work with
i work alone
thats it then
ive always been alone
thats why im a good driver
i can handle it
see i can think on my feet
i survive im a thinker
and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it dont bother me
some people cant do it
some people are ranting and raving tell them fuckin people to get out here and get in this car i cant i want a go
where you gonna go
youre gonna wind up back in your garage at seven oclock at night
you aint going nowhere
you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening
whats the big deal right
you understand the psychology of the job
some guys cant adjust to it they cant handle it
the car cuts through the upper east side
martin and the driver exchange looks through the rear view mirror
you look like youre far away
far away and thinking about other things
im right about that arent i
well lets just say that sometimes im right
sometimes you are
sometimes i am
its only natural
laughs to himself at this great truth its only natural
the driver pauses for dramatic emphasis i been looking at you and ive decided that i want to share something with you
because your problem is youre bored
and you have a very big mind
beat i am part of what i call a brain syndicate
no reaction from martin
i am part of a network of minds a group of five people who are all connected over hundreds even thousands of miles through the mind
we can think with each other think for each other
i can be driving somewhere sleeping with a woman whatever it is and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone elses mind far away
running someone elses brain
indicates up on the right
and when you think of it its not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world is it
a sedate and well appointed four star suite on the upper east side
martin stands in front of one of the open windows watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high rise across the street
he lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts it back
a cellular phone rings interrupting him
he moves to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase depresses a scrambler module flips it open and listens for a moment
if its not there i cant proceed
martin hangs up
picks up another phone and dials
as he waits for an answer he goes to a fed ex blueprint tube lying on the bed
ive been waiting for an answer
im only in town tonight
he breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished metal parts including a long thin barrel a scope and a silencer
whats different this time than the last time
i have to be down front
martin stands in front of the window phone in one hand the scope in the other
next to him the assembled rifle rests across the arm of a chair
i dont bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me
he glances over to a second window to his left which offers a view further down the street
he goes to it
he raises the scope and sees a few blocks down small even through the high powered scope is your average bicycle messenger dressed in lycra racing gear weaving through traffic
slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag
the messengers hand is hidden in it
the other phone begins to ring
hold on a second tom
i got my hands full here
he sets down the phone and answers the other still watching the messenger
account number transfer to account number
ask for mr
sanchez tell him its mr
if there are any problems access file io and look at it
martin drops the phone and moves away from window to the rifle
he mounts the scope and he looks out window at the high rise
of a doorman opening the door for a group of five men in suits
four bodyguards form a perimeter around the fifth man a mall avuncular figure in his forties dressed in saville row finery
takes a step back into the shadows of the room and raises the rifle toward window
of an empty street
the bicycle messenger flashes past
concentrating tracks the path of the messenger leading him left to right across the blind spot of the hotel room wall between window and window
the bicycle messenger bears down on the group of men drawing a mac submachine gun from his bag
the group see him just as martins sniper fire explodes the messengers chest
two of the bodyguards collapse onto their boss
the other two open fire on the messenger as he wipes out horribly into a parked car in front of them
withdraws from the window and picks up the phone again and begins to break down the rifle
but look i know its the playoffs
thats why im offering a thousand dollars for one seat
martin listens patiently as he works
unbuttoning his double breasted long coat
just finishes packing
well let me ask you tom
what do i have to do to get courtside tickets for the knicks
the two bodyguards kick at the messengers body
the other two begin to move off of their boss who rises cowering
the doorman stands behind it all unbuttoning his coat
a tall dark sharp featured man in his forties wearing a handlebar moustache
he moves toward the group of men as he flips open his coat back over two huge chrome
magnum charthouse bulldog revolvers and opens fire on them
is closing his bag when he hears the gun thunder
i gotta go
martin drops the phone grabs his scope and spins to the window
of the doorman kicking through the pile of dead bodyguards
he gets to the man at the bottom their boss
the doorman fires both guns
reacts surprised to see a second shooter
he pulls himself from the window puts away his scope and accelerates his exit
outside we see the doorman drop both guns on the pile of bodies
he walks back toward us through the glass doors and makes his way through the building toward the service exit
he sheds his uniform and stuffs it into a plastic bag
his two parcels in hand exits out the side door of the hotel and walks down the street
now wearing rich mans sweats hops off the loading dock walks to a lincoln town car and drives off
martin rolls down fdr drive in a lincoln town car once again on the cellular
tell them thats not my problem
i was paid for one job the cyclist not two
see you tomorrow marcella
i have mr
grocer for you
patch him through
martin notices another town car appears in the next lane
we recognize the doorman behind the wheel phone in hand
he is what do you want
im setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts
like a union
like a club
work less make more
thank you no
we could be working together making big money killing important people
im willing to let you in on the ground floor
and you could be
sort of like
a father figure to me
grocer ignores this
its a free market evolution
youll wake up to it
we used to run together when you were a rookie
i dont want to run against you
this things real
so dont paw at me with your dirty little guild
im gonna get you kid
martin hangs up and pulls away
martin sits in first class wiping his face and hands with an airline hot towel
he folds the wet cloth and once again speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines
he looks up as he hears pilot v
its seventy six degrees and partly cloudy in chicago this afternoon
martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment
he wearily drops his carry on bag and briefcase in the hall
martin sits on a futon couch watching mtv with no sound
on the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin bottles
martin takes some capsules from each and washes them down with a reddish orange beverage
martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor
his eyes are closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps his chest
dear alumni can you believe its been ten years
where are you now
after a moment his eyes open alerted
his head turns to the side and his hands lightly cup the headphones
from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box with one unmarked switch and one amber light definitely not a walkman
the wire continues out of the other side of the box across the floor connecting to a suction cup stuck to the floor
are you guiding an outward bound canoe trip like brook stinson
or perhaps in charge of appearances for the nfl like leslie gunther
draws a pre cut section of the floor the width of a pencil and twice as long by a string
the greenish starlight night vision image of a young husky man sleeping on his back as seen from above
a fine thread snakes from behind camera to just above the mans slack mouth
we pull back to reveal a sony watchman that holds the image
keep pulling to reveal martin watching it as he maneuvers the thread down past the fiber optic cable through the hole in the floor
concentrates as he applies three drops of blue liquid on the thread
as the drops run down along the thread through the floor his attention shifts to the the drops huge in the foreground become smaller as they make their way down
the line toward the sleeping man
could it be that youre like chip longfellow at the trade relations tank in washington
sandy glasser owns a cheese shop
adjusts the thread minutely with one hand and lowers the fiber optic cable with the other
the face begins to fill the screen as the fiber optic follows the drops toward it
suddenly the man snorts and turns his face
it misses the mans mouth and hits his cheek
the mans eyes snap open in terror as he looks directly into camera
his image falls away as the fiber optic is jerked back up through the hole in the floor
looking at yearbooks and pictures evokes so many memories
stuffs the apparati into an open duffel bag and flies out of frame
but all interesting
a bodyguard sits outside an apartment door
a muffled but dire scream is heard from within and he is on his feet gun in hand
an exit door in the hallway slams open revealing martin his gun already pointed at the bodyguard
the bodyguard levels his at martin
the bodyguard hesitates just long enough to get double tapped through the head
as a graduate of the class of you are someone special
martin moves to the dead bodyguard and locates a retractable key chain on his belt
he unreels the ring of keys and opens the door
he lets the keys retract back to the belt and drags him into the apartment
martin moves silently down the hall in a crouch
he comes to the bedroom and slips across the threshold
whenever news of you filters back the school is excited and proud of your accomplishments
martin crouches down outside the bedroom door
he points the gun at the door and reaching up turns the knob
as the door opens the husky man fires wildly over martins head
martin returns with one shot to the hut which sits the man down on the floor
we hope grosse pointe high prepared you well to lead the kind of life that makes an impact on the world
martin kicks the gun away from the fallen man and raises his barrel to the mans forehead
remember theres no where you can go that you havent learned how to go in time
in severe pain whatever it is that im doing that you dont like ill stop doing it
its not me
martin cocks the gun
the perpetual sun shines down on a small lot of pre fab office bungalows
a small suite of dry walled offices
is stenciled on glass doors behind martin who stands in front of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation
she is marcella mayes
so come on back to the old oak tree acorns
signed the reunion committee
marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly
for the first time martin looks scared
throw that away
dont tease me
you know what i do for a living
its from one of those p
how was the trip
i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail
all of it
and not show it to me
thats going to cost
martin begins to walk past her into his office but marcella stops him
theyre not happy sir
im not happy
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep
they blame you for the compromise
and they want me to make up for it
tell them thats impossible
i need my normal lead time
they were very upset
would you describe their position as inflexible
you leave tonight
marcella looks concerned
and sir i also get that broken mirror black cat friday the thirteenth kind of feeling about this one
theres nothing to be done about it
i liquidated the last account in zurich and split it into two new ones in estonia
mmm not really
but youre gonna love this one
she hands him a piece of paper
he scans it
but its a greenpeace boat
itd be so easy
martin looks at her wearily
he puts it into the paper shredder at the side of her desk
i have scruples
paperwork on the detroit thing
its a full dossier
she raises a thick brown dossier from the top of her desk and puts it down again
martin moves through a door to his private office
martin goes into his office and sits at his desk
on the walls are a couple of boring prints of tallships
a bookshelf holds trappings of a loose attempt at a cover a few shipping manifests sealane tables and other specialized reference books on import export
he sits and stares
time has passed and martin still sits at his desk massaging his gums with a rubber tipped dental pointer
the dental tool jumps across the gaps between his teeth like a hummingbird
off screen you should get going
pulls back his jacket lapel and fits the utensil into a pocket protector that is also home to a toothbrush emery board tweezers and comb
he stands and walks out of his office
martin moves toward the door
as he passes marcella she hands him the mauve envelope and a travel portfolio
dont forget your identity
see you next week
martin stops short as he reaches the threshold
he holds up the envelope and stares a dagger through it
on his way out over his shoulder
oatman im on my way
martin slouches on a leather couch
he holds the mauve envelope now open
why dont you want to go to your high school reunion
its in michigan
honestly what do i have in common with those people
or with anyone
oatman sits in the window
he is kris kringle esque and wears a sheepskin vest rough hewn shirt faded levis and old frye boots
oatman nods with the suave understanding of a man happy to collect fifty thousand in fees before asking a tough question
you went to school with these people
weve spent a lot of time discussing those years
remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared to the thought of the thing
thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite
shouldnt you be taking notes
tell me about your vision of the reunion
of a crowded gymnasium
the alumni below stops what they are doing and look up at martin drawing guns of all shapes and itll be depressing
how do you know
i just know
theyll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs
made themselves a part of something
and they can talk about what they do
what am i going to say
sarcastic i killed the president of paraguay with a fork
oatman twitches nervously almost spilling his coffee
you neednt be so frank with me about your work
i trust you
you couldnt turn me in because of doctor patient privilege
and i dont want to be withholding
and i know where you live
you know where i live
were both professionals oatman
i think what you fear martin is domesticity
its the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture
its centuries old
like king phillip in the th or th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought well
wouldnt it be great if we hit the road and fought
so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible
things to people rather than stay at home with their families
so youre saying that ulysses everything he said to his queen when he came back everything was a lie
he just wanted to fuck around
and how have you been feeling about your
its just getting hard to go to work in a good mood
im starting to think ive been in the business too long
last week i did a guy younger than me
from the back of the darkened empty church we see him mount the altar
a priest in fact
open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice
he removes it squirts a clear liquid into the cup and swishes it out
he returns the chalice to the cabinet
the church seems to be purging itself of its pedophile
sits in the back pew of the church now crowded for mann
he watches the priest lift the chalice into the air murmur a prayer and drink from it
the priest collapses behind the altar
its a bull market
the chalice bounces free from the priests hand as it hits the ground
anyway that never use to happen
i was always the prodigy
now im just one of the guys
maybe some of the discomfort youre feeling is
over the innocent people youve killed
if i show up at your door chances are you did something to bring me there
i dont care about that stuff anyway
oatmans glad the sessions just about over
go to your reunion martin
see those people and discover what they mean to you
try not to kill anybody for a few days see how you feel
if i get antsy ill kill a few small animals
now were making progress
no pictures or plants
almost no furniture and what he does have is black
the only sign of life is a cat
the cat watches on as martin sorts through a cardboard box finally coming to a photo album
just a minute
a teen aged martin blank shy boy with a nervous smile
he poses with his mother an older woman with a kind smile
but her eyes are dark aged by a life of work and worry
on the opposing page is a gilt funeral announcement that reads turns the page
a photograph of a tall thin girl a bright smile from within a bulky winter coat
a girl hes always wondered about debi newberry
handwritten on the photo in girlish loops would you rather
martin pulls himself away from the album and the cat follows him moaning hungrily food soon
martin opens a restaurant style refrigerator
it holds various bottles of vitamins spirulina wheatgrass digestible hydrogen peroxide fluoride treatment oxygenated mouth rinse and thirty cans of catfood
tuna or liver
tuna it is
he opens a can for the cat and a bottle for himself
while the cat eats he returns to the cardboard box
finds a yearbook
flips it open
a picture of a senior class blues brothers party a group of teens mug to the camera in blues brothers get ups
sprinters race for a finish line their chests stretching for the tape
a more mature version of the girl in the album
her name appears under his picture
track light fills the gourmet rustic kitchen
grocer stands wearing a burgundy fila sweat suit pushing beets into a vegetable juicer
next to the juicer are piles of celery and carrots as well
a low key blip is heard from another room
grocer tops off the glass and takes it out of the kitchen
grocer enters the main room of the villa style a frame
he moves to an antique oak desk and sits in front of a computer
click ok for remote access caller ok is clicked
availability for two days in detroit area terms when now ok fax materials grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice
after a moment the fax machine on the desk rattles
the computer beeps
confirmation number of wire transfer aj oi grocer hits the return button after taking in the number
a graphic appears connection is terminated status idle grocers fax begins to moan and chatter
grocer raises his juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast
martin reclines in first class soaring toward the midwest on the red eye
he has already scanned his magazines and they are piled in the empty seat next to him
he sets aside a powerbar
martin reads kill without joy
after a moment he sets the book down and takes up iron john
at the edge of the airport bar sits lardner and mccullers two government spooks agency unknown
they are both in blazers no ties early thirties and they watch the passing crowd
you always say that
you always say that
im telling you you never met the man
seventeen months ago i was posting a walk in lisbon and he was there
he never saw me
but i saw him though
in portugal yes
in the background martin passes by them as he walks down the hall
without directly regarding him the two stand drop some cash on the bar and begin to leave
heres the news he hasnt been in portugal since
i know that from the file
why dont you read the file man
in fact i think i talked with him in bonn
lardner can neither confirm nor deny this
you always say that
you always have to know everybody
why dont i just take the weekend off and let you kill him
since you two are so close
martin in a black lincoln town car veers off of the airport artery and on to a turnpike
the radio broadcasts the news
with highs today in the upper seventies
related stocks on wall street today as scandal continues to rock the joint u
japanese tech center
blows past camera and on down the road
after a beat a mid eighties ford country squire station wagon follows occupied by two figures
are lardner and mccullers
they listen to the same broadcast
an unknown whistle blower has leaked a number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next years models to authorities that could cost millions in recalls
flips through the dial pausing on rush limbaugh who waxes fascistically
and then turns the dial again and cuts in on armageddon time slow reggae vibe by the clash
martin drives down the roadway
headlong into his past
martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar voice
on radio this is wfrn all vinyl all the time
oldies from the eighties
its a cold summer day in grosse pointe lit only by dime slivers of sunlight in front of a microphone
stray gossamer strands of hair hanging in her face move in front of her mouth as she speaks
and im ready for some good tunes and angry talk
or angry tunes and good talk looking somewhere far away beyond what is before him in the windshield
or maybe well just play the cocteau twins and get over the goo angry talking music
as you know as they distractedly toy with the wire at the base of the mic
for some moments in life there are no words and a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest man still rapt makes a sharp turn into a
the cocteau twins though also a band of the nineties will be aired due to the fact that they created their own language to sing by slows on a quaint
street of cute shops
he creeps up to a storefront on hid right and stops staring through the passenger window
the female deejay
she sits slumped in a well worn executive chair her back to the studio console and the picture window behind it that opens to the street
now thats freedom she swivels in the chair to face the street
of martins town car outside martin silhouetted in shadow
her brow furrowed as she peers at the car something summoned by the dark figure
her words falter almost imperceptibly
the best i can do is a rhyme where are all the good men dead
in the heart or in the head
shaken from his trance by her stare pulls back into the street and disappears
martin drives listening to the radio
he turns the corner with an expectant look on his face
suddenly his face drops as he slows and pulls over
martin looks left of the store then right behind him then back at the store
bewildered he gets out of the car
of martin as he walks with purpose
he halts in the middle of the lot
he puts his hands on his hips stares then moves in
we stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the clerk inside
what are you doing here
carl the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question
a double shift
whats it look like
softening can i help you with something
martins head pans the room processing
i dont think so
martin continues to gaze at the structure as if its a lunar landscape
into phone dr
please pick up if youre there
its martin blank
its not here
my house is gone and now theres a here
and thats unfortunate
you can never go home again dr
martin hangs up
he watches one stop shoppers come and go
to himself but i guess you can shop there
of a nurse leading him down a drab antiseptic hallway
she banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching her purse in one hand a filterless
pall mall in the other a light coat on
this is mary blank
she suffers from alzheimers or something just as debilitating
mary your sons here
the nurse gently eases mary up
martin hugs mary stiffly and pats her shoulders
mary takes hold of martins arm
they start out of the room
they walk past a school yard park fitted with a set of swings baseball diamonds and a small grove of trees
she smokes and hacks
i bought a new rug
thats wonderful mom
whats a revival tent
its a place where religious people knowingly marlin perkins and jim
he acted like marlins son only he wasnt
at least they never said he was
i bet they were lovers faggots
yes gay lovers
wild kingdom my ass
mary coughs horribly
its good to see you
im sure youre curious about what ive been doing
i spoke to your father the other day
i imagine thatd be rather difficult
nature made him then broke the mold
martin decides to change the subject
they told me youre taking lithium mom
yes they give me headaches
i have a headache
you have a headache
i have a headache
you have a headache
no i dont have one
you dont have a headache
i have a headache
mary leans in close smiling
we had a good laugh didnt we
i guess we did
as they head toward martins car mary stops and points to it
why dont you return this car and borrow mine
have debi follow you to the rent a car so you can get a ride back
i think ill go see debi today
of course you will
i cant think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given i left and never said goodbye to her
take care of her
shes a keeper
and a leader
didnt she meet castro on foreign exchange
i have always thought about her and missed her
a nurse approaches with a wheelchair
separate the wheat from the chaff and youve got the candle cat
together martin and the nurse help mary into it
mary gazes at martin taking him in
remember no matter how impossible your problems feel
ive known people without a chance in the world
and all of a sudden they have lives
time allows miracles
let yourself breathe son
martin bends down and kisses her on the cheek
the nurse spins the chair around and heads toward the building
he is somewhat fatigued from the experience but he tries once more to connect
the nurse stops and turns mary around to face him
mary looks up at martin and brightens
she starts to sing out like ethel merman arms out broadway style
whats up doc whats cookin
whats up doc
are ya lookin
youre gonna hurt someone with that old shotgun hey
we really mean it
mary stops short and squints at martin
hey youre a handsome devil
whats your name
martin stops the car and looks out the window at the sea of headstones
he jerks his hand in a stiff wave
you got off easy
the house is a
moms a psycho pharmacological punching bag and i murder for cash
if you were here i think youd be proud
he drives off
the room features a big square bed dresser and television
martin enters kicks a leather bag under the bed and grabs the steel sided briefcase
pries out a wall vent slides in the case and replaces the vent
lardner and mccullers are staked out along the main strip of town
lardner snores face pressed up against the passenger window
mccullers lays back in his seat a to go cup in his lap
he taps the cup with one finger as he absently sings his favorite bob seeger song to himself
against the wind
just a young man running
against the wind
let the cowboys ride
blame on it the thuuunder
mccullers catches of martins town car coming down the street
he nudges lardner and points
of martin pulling into a space on the street outside the radio station
he gets out looking nervous
debi flips on the on air switch and prepares to speak into the microphone
martin walks in
debi sees him
they stare at each other
the song ends
after a moment
on air groping wrfn playing all vinyl all the time
oldies from the eighties
that was ah
one of their songs
debi turns to turntable b and finds it empty
she turns back to turntable a and lets the record roll on
and heres another
debi swivels around to face martin
oldies from the eighties
after a long pause
i just play my own collection
its nice to see you again
debi says nothing just stares at him in shock
how long has it been
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word
ten years i think
what i miss
debi slowly grooves into irony her best defense
well let me see
they tore down the george orwell monument and put up a bust of george michael
main streets a four laner no left turns four to seven
i was married and divorced
and grosse pointe is now officially the new sister city to lower hutt new zealand
we have fiber optic town meetings every two months
here is now there
there is here
their eyes lock on each other
those are the headlines
the request line buzzes
hold that thought
into phone wrfn fm grosse pointe
all vinyl all the
pauses no pearl jam
call back in ten years
debi makes the move
tell me about yourself
im in california most of the time
traveling a lot on business
thats about it really
not much else
whats your business
im a professional killer
do you get dental with that
well im in town for a few days anyway
they run out of words the moment too big for small talk
martin gets the fear breaks it off
well i gotta go
but ill come back
martin leaves debi sitting alone in disbelief
martin steps out of the storefront station along the fashionable grosse pointe shopping district
he stops in the middle of the street with a strained look on his face
of martin standing in the street
they frown wondering at martins next move
debi lost in thought still
after a moment she sits upright and flips the on air switch
into mike a man comes to you
he is from the past bringing you pain long since put behind you
he says peculiar things and leaves abruptly
it all comes flooding back
martin stops in his tracks
his face softens then becomes determined
he turns and walks back toward the station
it felt like an apparition or some cheap gruesome rod serling time warp id been thrust back into without warning
theres a strangeness in the air and i dont mind telling you im a little spooked
he was a man from my past
a man i loved
a man who disappeared
of martin walking back into the station
a man whos walking back into the station
martin comes into the booth
the temperature rises as they square off
i dont think so
well remember when frysals men paid off the deejay in cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the nooo yes
and the munich olympics in
a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened
mccullers is not to be outdone
thats strictly baader meinhof stuff
it was the plo
martin and debi locked in a passionate embrace
they break away
debi clandestinely flips the on air switch as she drops into her chair
the on air light bar goes on above and behind martin
unbeknownst to him their conversation is put out over the airwaves
all right mystery man
i want some answers
two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry
the girl sits in a seven hundred dollar prom dress at her fathers house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life
the boy never shows up until now
so whats the question
where have i been
more like what happened
what happened mr
i dont know exactly
i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization
i thought you know
maybe seeing you some friends my house
of course now a torn down in the name of convenience and i guess sure seeing you would be part of that whole equation
i suppose the most important thing really
i dont know
anyway this whole things my therapists idea
its my shrink really
youre in therapy too marty
you see someone
so youre back now a decade later and you want to sort things out with me
the question now is do i allow you
to my being
martin says nothing
all right then
would you like to share any more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down
on this one
a beat as martin realizes hes been had
he seems about to bolt
should a broken hearted girl give a guy a second chance at love
debi jabs a phone line on the console
youre on the air
i think this young man has avoided the question completely
has not discussed what happened nor if hes sorry for what he has done
therefore i dont see any reason why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and feelings
thank you caller
stabs another line
youre on the air
are you there
no the guy
martin looks up humiliated
when you guys use to go out
did you guys ever
heh heh heh heh
ever fuckin ever totally fuckin heh heh heh next caller
i dont know debi
sounds like bad gas to me
i would not allow him access to your being
grosse pointe michigan i hear you loud and clear if you love something set it free
if it comes back to you its well
she turns to him and shrugs apologetically
martin has his answer
martin leaves the station alone and beaten down
never trust my instincts
he scans the main strip
a man walks down the street
he is felix a bookish forgettable man in his forties wearing le coq sportif sweats and shoes
he looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head
martins seen him somewhere and doesnt like what he remembers
martins pov tracks him
as he walks down the street he spots the country squire and eyes lardner and mccullers in the front seat
follows felixs eyes to lardner and mccullers and catches their look
their eyes lock neither wanting to betray that theyve made each other
they all do a pretty good job
swings to a square jawed hale fellow wearing dark sunglasses who is approaching directly and only a few feet away
the man is going for something in his breast pocket
reaches into his own jacket most likely for a gun
pulls out a glasses case and takes off his shades he is martin relaxes
grinning ear to ear hell i wouldve voted for you but theres all this apple sauce stuck in my phone
i dont wanna talk about it
how the hell are you
extends his hand heres five good ones
no trace of recognition on martins face
re hand youre leaving me hanging here
martin looks him up and down astonished at the respectable veneer of his old burn out friend
give me a break
martin and paul rive through grosse pointe michigan wide streets lined with huge shady oaks
castle like homes on golf course green lawns
a comfortable midwestern beverly hills
they are cruising their old haunts paul smoking a joint
this wont take but a minute
i just gotta hold their hands for a final walk through
ill take them in get em out then you and i can grab a little quality time
martin looks out the window breathing in the past
goddamn its good to see you
i was afraid you joined a cult or something
i half expected you to come back to town in a fennel wreath and paper pants
paul offers martin the joint
there was no money in it
martin regards paul archly
grinning so what happened to you
same thing that happened to you i stopped poutin there on the sidelines
got on the team
i joined the working week you slick fucking asshole so why dont you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy paul
god its great to see you
of a lovely young couple on the front porch of a mid sized wright home
perhaps that could be him if things were different but for now it feels like along shot
paul is hawking the house to them out of earshot
well we do what we have to do if we find you on the property
but we dont really enforce the law we execute company policy for homeowners
standing in the driveway
so when are you authorized to use deadly force
well a course taxes provide your basic service police and whatnot
but our customers need a little more than just that you understand
this badge doesnt mean that i am a peace officer
the woman turns at martin and smiles
martin smiles back
so its not a meaningful symbol or anything
that badge is just the badge of your company
if i look suspicious on your customers property well under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to ah
to shoot me
to shoot you
how did you get this job
well they were hiring and it was only a two week course
paul walks the happy couple down the steps
to couple what more can i say
smiling well talk soon
much hand gesturing youll be raising your new family in a work of art
a work of art in a work of art
paul looks at martin and the guard inviting them into the sell
im sure youll be very happy
all look to martin
heartfelt when my time comes if it ever does i want a beautiful normal place like this
and a wife like you
all are confused
martin thumbs to the guard
and youll be safe here
paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders
lardner and mccullers sit in the wagon watching the house in the distance
martin and paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood
i dont make a habit of pimping my friends but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see
a sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view
a long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house
kind of crept up on you didnt it
you drove us here
yeah but its still kind of eerie isnt it
martins not listening
his eyes track the house out the window
of the mansion
they roll slowly by debis house
they drive in silence for a beat
paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder jams the brake and turns on martin
i freaked out joined the army worked for the government and went into business for myself
im a professional killer
paul satisfied gets back on the road
professional killer huh
does that come with a good hmo
paul makes a turn
they approach a large car dealership
the sign above it says looking ahead he sells bmws
he sold me this bad boy
how could you put your hard earned dollars into the hands of the class bully
he gave me a great deal
paul slows outside the lot
bob destephano a big angry looking man in an expensive suit stands in the lot puffing up amidst his stable of expensive cars
the cars running great
dismissive glad to hear it
bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away
see you later
martin climbs out of pauls car and begins to walk toward his own
paul calls after him
see you at the left a boy came back a man made good party
martin nods him off
paul pulls away
stands across the street from the radio station looking at debi in the window
martin draws a thin rifle scope from his back pocket and lifts it to his eye
of debi in the crosshairs bored tapping a pencil to the beat of an unheard song
he puts the scope away and gets in his car
martin walks into the store looking around once again at his old home
to the left of the door a typical suburban teenage skateboarder is lost in the mortal combat video game and something too loud from his walkman
carl still working the double nods to martin
can i help you
whats done is done
martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack
he picks out a pack of beamans and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter
on the way he makes a black town car pulling into a spot next to his own
he immediately changes course and bee lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down
comes through the door drawing a mac for each hand
grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom of the glock
mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit
grabs the cash drawer sets it on the counter and puts his hands up
felix shoots carl dead on his way toward bolts up the cooler aisle
bursts of fire follow him taking out each freezer door behind him
exchange fire john woo style between the aisles of the cramped store
felix delivers a close to home burst as he jumps the counter sending martin diving out of view
pinned behind the slurpee machine pauses to reload his now two glock nines
martin steals a glance to get a bead on felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the slurpee machine spattering him with several flavors
and thats all he can take
martin comes up blasting with both guns but all thats left of felix is swinging doors and squealing tires
martin moves to the cashier island low to the ground
twitches and jerks still absorbed in his game and oblivious to the surrounding carnage
martin crawls through the waist level swinging door and moves to carl
is really dead
martin rolls him over to check it out and finds under the corpse
flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the counter toward the doors
he grabs the shoulder or the skateboarder who shrugs him off annoyed what the fuck man
the video game screen explodes
shot full of martins bullets
the skateboarder reacts backward and martin jerks him out of the double doors
the skateboarder is running like crazy and martins car is peeling out in reverse as the is blown to hell
martins hair is matted with slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out
he sees his do in the mirror pulls out a comb and starts to comb it back into a slick pat riley style
martin walks in not looking half bad considering
debi looks up from some reading
naive melody by the talking heads plays in the studio
are you going to the reunion
im not going
is that why youre here
thats part of it
well youll have a ball
you seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back
the car the suit the watch
that just leaves the little things like happiness character point of view
its always the little things
im wondering how youve been
how you are
id like to catch up with you
if its possible
beat as debi considers
she spins her seat to face him
lets catch up
you go first
well theres not much to tell
im sure youve done worthwhile things in the last ten years
youve had experiences
you met people
it sounds like you need a shockabuku
its a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever
thatd be good
what do you want
the question is open
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven oclock
let me get this straight are you asking me out
seven it is
ill think about it
under a crisp and starry night a man and a woman sit around a campfire
as we move closer we see that the woman is marcella reading women who run with wolves
she tends to smores on the campfire assembles one and hands it to monty her young outdoorsman boyfriend
monty is perched on a small boulder engaged in a tai chi like ritual wearing patagonias finest
there is a path of crystals leading from the fire to the boulder
in the background is a tent and a nissan pathfinder
montys watch goes off
baby its eight oclock
marcella gets up
she tousles montys hair on the way to the truck
marcella gets in
she shuts the door and dials the phone
hey there howd it go
martin sits on the edge of the bed in a towel
it isnt done
marcella pauses taking this in
this is not good
ill do it tomorrow
marcella considers this
whats it look like
you havent looked at the dossier
a little defensive ive looked at it
martin eyes the vent
its the same as usual
nothing remarkable about it at all
i have to call the client and give them a reason why youre late
tell them my house exploded
marcella doesnt know what to make of this
ill call them and tell them youre taking your time
being a professional
okay call them
oh and if you could find out why they double booked the job and who is trying to kill me and call me back thats be great
martin hangs up
he moves up to the air vent deciding to get down to business
he pries it open and withdraws his briefcase putting it down on the bed and propping it open
he looks at the unopened dossier for a moment flips it over in his hands and tosses it on the bed
we catch a glimpse of martins weapons
martin picks up the envelope and is about to tear the seal when martin drops the envelope and lifts the receiver
filtered are you there
pick me up at my fathers house at around seven
and dont be late this time
this night this reunion will be an important step in our relationship
youre fucking psycho
dont rush to judgement until all the facts are in
she hangs up
martin smiles and replaces the receiver
he turns to the apparatus laid out on the bed
what has been his life is beginning to look more like death to him
he places the envelope in the case then returns the case to its hiding place
lardner and mccullers stake out martin from the country squire across the street
i wish hed do his job already so we could do our job
we cant do our job unless he does his job
why dont we just do his job then so we can do our job and get the fuck out of here
do his job
im not a cold blooded killer
wait a minute look
you want to kill a good guy but not be a bad guy you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy and then you come in and kill
the bad guy and then youre the good guy
so if we do his job were the bad guys
if we do our job were the good guys
they both laugh as if at some great joke
their laughter is caught short by the sight of moving into the diner
martin sits in a window booth splitting nutrient caplets into an apple juice and looking out the window
slides into the booth across from martin
martin draws a nasty little ppk pistol from his waist and levels it at grocer under the table but grocer is already drawing his pistol down there and there is
an instant mexican breakfast stand off
a waitress approaches
welcome to b
my name is melanie and ill be your server this morning
let me tell you about some of our specials
today we have the alfalfa on my mind our feature omelette
and theres our gatsbys west egg omelette
and if youre in the mood for something different theres the i left my heart in san franchezie
martin and grocers eyes remain locked
i want two eggs poached hash brown well done
english muffin for the bread
and a coffee
whole grain pancakes
and an egg white omelette
what would you like in the omelette
nothing in the omelette
nothing at all
the waitress nods pertly and leaves
re the omelette come on live a little
im sorry about the incident yesterday
no harm no foul
a little misunderstanding among my associates
i told them to kill you and they didnt
hard to get good help these days
but since were both here i think its time to take a fresh look at our relationship
i didnt get into this business to have associates
and i dont want to join your goddamned union
loner loner gunman
on my own
thats the whole point
why dont you become a cop or something
you can drink coffee in the morning
grocer looks a little hurt
easing up look this is a one on one business
every time you get to know people bad things happen
if itll make you feel any better this is my last job
so what do you say we put our guns away and forget the whole damn thing
grocer loses it
from now on everythings regulated
long beat as grocer gets a hold of himself
but were not going to let you do your job
because were gonna do it
and then after we do your job were gonna do another little job
wry is that right
yeah after i shoot you through the fucking forehead im gonna fuck you in the bullethole
nice talk sugarmouth
martin sits at a desk staring at the reunion card
he tosses it aside gets up and moves in front of a mirror
he wears a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile
trying on smile yes im a pet psychiatrist
i sell couch insurance
i test market positive thinking
i lead a weekend mens group actually
we specialize in ritual killings
im hungry are you hungry im hungry oooh ooh
sarcastic hi im martin blank remember me
im not married i have no kids and id blow your brains out if someone paid me enough
so howve you been
where do you stand on the issues
are you left
up down proud shamed blahblahblahblah martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door holding a simple bouquet of flowers
he skips up the front steps and finds the doorbell
after a moment debi answers
as long as i get the laugh
taking them here
let me put these in some rubbing alcohol
she backs into the house and he follows
martin follows debi into the hall
both are enjoying this atavistic ritual
you look beautiful
through a doorway leading into a den
all thats visible of mr
newberry debis father is a pair of legs resting in a barcolounger
let me get my coat
ill just help myself to a cocktail
moves up the stairs and disappears
looks at the legs rolls his shoulders and heads into the den
newberry sits in the recliner reading a tom clancy novel
he is a corporate aspen dude ranch sort with a good head of hair
he sighs closes the book on his knee and looks up to martin
good evening mr
good evening mr
how are you
martin i dont know where youve been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago and i dont care
it was good that you left and im glad you did
so what do you want to talk about
youve grown up a bit
maybe i had you figured wrong
i visualized you in a haze as one of the slackster flannel wearing coffeehouse misanthropes ive been seeing in newsweek
i took the other road
im more of a self reflective young lion who does business with lead pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky eyes isolation
i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone
oh you know me martin
im the same old sell out baby boomer exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state
but why dont we have a drink and forget the whole thing
newberry lays down his book and moves behind the wet bar
so what are you doing with your life now son
im a professional killer
debis footsteps are heard coming down the stairs
newberry watches martin turn and walk out of the room
martin and debi pull away from the curb
martin and debi drive through that to debi is town and to martin is a widening pool of quicksand
do you want to get a drink first
i think theyll probably have booze there
martins right hand shakes off of the wheel a bit
he grips it tighter
suddenly martin turns the wheel and pulls into a gas station parking lot halting next to a pay phone
ill just be a second
debi nods a little confused but going with it
martin stands at the kiosk next to the town car mid conversation
defensive well i didnt kill anyone but someone tried to kill me and the guy in the middle got killed
so if i see that guy again im definitely going to kill him but i wont kill anyone else
oh except for the guy i was sent here to kill
i dont know
oatman treats his patient
saw my mom
im with debi and im on my way to the reunion
in the background lardner and mccullers drive past the station
repeat this after me
martin looks to debi
she looks up and smiles
we hear dr
oatmans command martin mumbles them back
i am at home with the me
i am rooted in me who is on this adventure
take a deep breath and realize that this is me breathing
this is me breating
martin takes in a few breaths
i gotta go
and dont kill anyone
dont kill anyone
felix rummages delicately around the room
he goes to the the reunion invite
picks it up and scans it
lardner and mccullers sit it the parking lot
they watch martin and debi pull into a space
hes falling for her
look at him
he using her
look at his face
one cannot love and kill
defensive i love
climb out of the car
martin breathing deeply and wiping his sweaty palms leans against the car and tries to calm himself
eighties music echoes from the gym
to himself shoulda brought my gun
he pulls himself off the car and heads toward a sprawling red brick gothic structure with many wings
it is topped by church like towers
martin and debi enter and pause to take in the entire scene
a benevolent ronald reagan hangs crookedly above
basketball nets are swung back draped with crepe
lights are half low and the music is loud
alumni are dancing
im arlene oslott joseph
im martin blank
debi heads off into the gym smiling back as she strands martin
arlene rises from a card table
they have little to say
martin wasnt part of her crowd
marty you havent changed a bit
dont say that
arlene gives him a nametag
as a special torture the tags have yearbook photos
martin looks at the name tag uncomfortably
we had pictures put on that way everybody knows who everybody was
so what are you doing now
whatever i can get away with
she smiles at his joke and is immediately distracted by the next arrival
martin moves off
to the next person isnt it cute
its so everybody knows who everybody was
he circles the crowded gym
looking for familiar faces
he stops at the open bar
what can i make you
the bartender gets him a beer
martin recognizes a guy at the bar
he is well appointed and shiny
he is ken aldridge
how have you been
glancing at martins name tag hello martin
how have you been
bob destephano arrives next to them and orders a drink
eye contact is made
bob turns slightly toward them
they continue in their conversation
im an attorney
im with moss brice fromeyer
that sounds pretty interesting
bob wants to join the conversation but doesnt know how
im in divorce mainly
some personal injury
those all seem kind of related
bob takes another drink and mopes off martin watches him go
tragedy makes you thirsty
the bartender arrives with the bottle
martin grabs it and begins to move off
i have to take this over to debi
take my card
wait a minute
heres a special one
for top shelf clients
ken hands martin a monte blanc pen with kens title and business address printed on the shaft
martin reads it and puts it in his kerchief pocket
ken goes back to listening to the guys at the bar
makes his way through the upbeat crowd of well wishers
terry emerges like an inkspot on a clean white whirt and intercepts martin
his angst is barely under control as he sidles up to martin
i dont know blank all these fucking people driving me crazy
look at them over there memorializing old times acting all like it was something life changing
and the people in the national honor society
the name tags
they have special blue starts on them like it fucking matters now that they were in the honor club ten years ago
im getting fucking nauseous from all this sentimental bullshit
its making me sick
terry stops suddenly as if hes finished
martin reads this mans nametag
why are you here
terry turns on a dime
i wanted to see a couple people
but i dont want to talk about the old days
what did we have together martin
yeah i couldnt stand that fucking class
but i appreciate you helping me out man
dont mention it
well im going to try and get out of here man
ill see you later
terry slinks off
bob destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns to leave thoroughly morose
in his path he finds dan koretzky the good looking side of brainy
hey i saw you at your dads dealership the other day
i sell bmws
what do you do
not much actually
my software company just went public so im just
hanging out really
theres a sudden lull in the conversation
bob tries his drunken hand at relating
remember high school
why dont you join us up in the grandstands
dan points up to a group of happy laughing people
bob walks off shaking his head and smiling bitterly
debi and martin are seated at a round table with six others in an area blocked off for dinner
plates of gumbo are arriving and the wine is poured
darius an african american is in mid conversation with amy who looks like she walked out of a laura ashley catalog and sits on the other side of martin
dennis and mike are two suits in the midst of a non stop sports conversation
you gotta hold the fans responsible though dennis because theyre the ones putting up with the mediocre product
i guess though you know if you look at it mike that park is a beautiful park ive gone to that park many times ive had the greatest time of
my life at that ballpark and lets face it i tell you this mike by the sixth inning if youre having the fun you should be having at tigers stadium you dont even know what the hells going on anyway
they both crack up at this
have you two been together since high school
actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue
debis a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna we havent seen each other since high school
you two look too happy together
i shouldnt say that though im married
so martin what are you up to these days
what do you do for a living
debi perks up this should be interesting
im in pro active international relations
its a very specialized company
we execute economic investment opportunities
sort of economic clean up
with an emphasis on personnel
its boring you know its boring
i dont like to talk about it because i dont think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is
martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table
martin may be in trouble
ive always tried to refrain from a black and white moral lexicon you know good bad right wrong ive been more interested in the gray areas
martin pushes on
but thats no way to live
i guess youve got to just take the leap of faith
believe in something
sounds complicated martin
are you happy
i just have to close this one last account
id like to just stop now today but i cant
its a step in the right direction
i dont know martin
it sounds like youre feeling compromised
live the way you want
the only thing thats inexcusable to me is cynicism
thats the biggest cop out there is
nods of assent come from around the table
a brief silence and then
i still dont understand what you do
i work at kentucky fried chicken
debi suppresses a laugh
you do not
yes i do
in the corporate offices
what do you do
i sell biscuits to the southland
you do not
its what i do
youre so funny
i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland stop it you know those horsey biscuit gravy packets
i move all of those no
sometimes we sell them to mcdonalds and just change them to special barbecue sauce
across the table from martin and debi dennis turns to darius
what do you think about black coaching in the nfl darius
because i think its great
i dont pay much attention to football
i have to agree with you dennis
its good to see that the owners are willing to put the franchise behind a black head coach or qb when for years in the league theyve been kept out
of the thinking positions and relegated mainly to the physical game
but now you see you have warren moon at the helm cunningham art shell and the coach up at minnesota
and if you remember doug williams was the first black man to prove that on a superbowl sunday
amy leans in to martin
to martin im teaching art at cedar junior high school
where do you stand on this whole louis farrakhan issue
facetious im a de klerk man myself
debi nods indicating to the deejay stand
im going over to play some tunes
martin watches her walk away
dan koretzky sits with two other former squares turned handsome fellas who now enjoy a confidence that comes with early investment in microsoft
martin looks out over the milieu below enjoying the seene
he eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back
look at her
there it is
the finest thing that ever walked these halls
i believe she married the state of maine
yeah hes around here somewhere
what a shame
she would have looked great in my fucking bentley
no my friends jenny beam
not only was she as fine if not finer than slater but she had the bad girl thing going for her
and the red hair
shes a paramedic in skokie illinois
you both are mistaken
jenny maretti was the finest
no question about it
the three jennys
all named jenny
you know what im really hoping
that jenny slater gets divorced
and shes twenty eight shes got half the state of maine shes twenty eight years old with two kids shes still really really fine and i see her at a
bookstore or something and she sees me for what i was then and what i am now the redemption for all her failure
you mean the redemption for all your failure
they ponder this
martin looks down on the gym concentrating on debi
dancing drunkenly miserable like an unbalanced orangutan
martin stands by debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay booth on a raised stage
they are playing an old sophomoric game
which would you rather
would you rather
commit yourself sexually to a four by nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super model for a month or make love to a otter
on crank for a week
ill take the junkie otter clearly
id let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants
would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller shes not dead its just a game
candied diller or
wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth
i have to give this some thought
clearly candied diller
stacey breaks the moment looking up at the two horrified and unsure at what shes heard
how are you
so many people came but i never expected to see you marty
or you debi
because of what your divorce
i didnt mean to say that
i just meant you look so good
do you think you could play too shy by kaja goo goo
stacey why dont you come up here and take over for a little while
id love to
stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as martin and debi make their way down
to martin everybody thinks they know me now that im divorced
she leads martin toward the exit
its time to see you in private
martin and debi walk down the hallway alone together
even though i left you never left me
not just memory but a substance in my blood
smiling like heroin
too junky kitschy
enjoying this like love
the physical substance of love
ill accept that
together they move into what appears to be the nurses office and close the door behind them
martin and debi make wild banshee love
lardner and mccullers watch felix into the gym
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us
if he does our job hes our job
i get it
steps through the doorway hes standing in and strolls into the crowded gym
he wears the standard khaki pants blue blazer combo with no nametag
hes clearly too old for the class of
martin and debi come out of the nurses office
the post coital mood is broken as they hear the human leagues dont you want me baby
blasting from the gym
martin and debi tune in on the song for a moment unhappy at remembering that particular moment in pop music history
debi looks to martin something must be done about it
ill be right back
debi kisses him
they split up
martin walks off the happiest weve seen him
bob and several others from the muscle to fat crew play a drunken scrimmage with a papier mache table ornament footbal that is coming unwound
bob quarterbacks and begins to recite a long complicated and forgotten play
martin approaches from behind bob and glides through the ad hoc line up continuing down the hall
bob yells hike as he stares after martin distracted
bobs rushed upon and sacked
he lets the papier mache ball drop and crack on the floor
martin walks down a silent deserted hall of lockers and classroom doors
the only sounds are his footsteps and the echoed strains of iggy pops wild child from the distant gym
he stops at locker number and flips the dial right back left right again
he pops up the steel false ceiling in the empty locker fishes his hand in the opening and withdraws what he is looking for an ancient joint
he holds it up and examines the now brown and dried reefer
he grinds it into dust in his hand
debi comes out of the gym and starts down the hall the music changed for the better
martin senses he is not alone
he turns to find bob destephano
the big man holds a glass unsteadily and slurs slightly when he speaks
bob is looking sad and scary
he leans into martin so
you and debi
gonna hit that shit again
how are you
its all fucked up
nothing adds up to nothing
you work your whole life day in and day out try to make sense of it all
one day youre twenty seven and what do you get to show for it
you couldve been a contender huh
bob realizes he cant even express his own tragedy without the use of cliches
lets see how smart you are with my foot up your ass
im gonna kick your ass
martin steps to bob
why would you want to hit me bob
do you really believe that theres some stored up conflict that needs resolution between us
we dont exist
theres nothing between us
so who do you want to hit bob
its not me
bob slumps against the lockers deflated
what am i gonna do
what do you want to do
i want to be an actor
then express yourself bob
bob frowns trying to think of a way to express himself
catching him be honest
bob backs up and lets out a huge drunken caveman scream then stops abruptly and smiles
bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight
martin watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the doors of a stairwell disappearing
bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the stairs
he encounters debi on her way up
he glances at her but does not break stride
debi gives him wide berth and quickens her pace up the stairs
martin watches the doors swing to a stop
he exhales and relaxes
and then spin pivots on his right heel as a burst from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was a split second before as he spins around
his right hand withdraws kens give away pen from his kerchief pocket pops the cap off and drive the pen up and through the throat of his attacker impaled through the throat on the pen his head snapped back
are frozen for a moment
blood runs quickly down the front of felixs body off of his shoes and on to the floor
the stairwell doors band open
martins head turns toward the sound
his eyes lock onto who is frozen horrified for a moment
looks back at dead
a growing pool of blood
looks around wildly holding felix up against the lockers
above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming rips it down from the wall with his free hand wraps it around felix stuffs the body into his open locker and
slams it shut
he pulls off his shoes and socks puts a sock over each hand like mittens and wipes up the small pool of blood
he stuffs the socks into his pockets takes off down the hall and bangs through the doors
martin blasts through the upstairs doors to the grandstands looking for debi below
she is nowhere to be found
he scans the party in progress it is the same frame of image as the one in oatmans office
in the middle of the floor terry slowly turns up to meet martins eyes
pulls the doors shut and takes off down the hall
martin opens his locker withdraws the corpse and hefts it over his shoulder
brick walled darkly lit and narrow
martin bounds down the steep steps with his load
martin hustles toward a cage door in front of him
he kicks through it and dumps felix into a canvas laundry cart on casters and begins rolling
the door bangs open and light pours into the room from behind martin
he negotiates the cart over the dirt floor and stops next to the furnace that heats the swimming pool
he pauses and looks to the ceiling the music from the reunion pulses into the floor above him
martin picks up a large metal bar and works open the door on the hulking cast iron furnace
a white hot blaze roars within
the party is winding down
a harried looking martin walks in and looks around once more for debi nothing
of the deejay booth
it is empty
he moves over to the bar and joins ken aldridge
he motions to the bartender who opens a beer for him
have you seen debi newberry
they both look around at the last of the reunion
the more things change the more they goddamned well stay the same
before ken can get started again
take care of yourself ken
thanks for the pen
martin walks out of the gym
paul is leaning against his beemer having a smoke
what the hell happened to you
i was catching up with bob destephano
as long as you had a good time
martin scans the lot for sign of debi
chase the girl
there is a beat of silence
nothing seems worth saying
it didnt work out
thats too bad
i have to get my head back into my work
works good for the soul
martin gets up to leave
when you see debi tell her im sorry
see you in ten years
paul watches him leave
he almost stops him but thinks better of it
martin hunches over his briefcase that lays open on the bed
the dossier from the briefcase
its seal is broken but the contents remain enclosed
he withdraws the package and dumps the contents on the bed
his face registers muted shock
dumb fucking luck
include various photos of mr
newberry with debi and the house
the photos are mingled with official looking papers including credit reports medical records etc
he cocks his head toward the door anticipating a
he freezes then plucks a gun tapped under a desk and moves toward the door pointing
halfway to the door his face and body slacken
he lobs the gun onto the bed
with everything gone wrong there is nothing left to defend
he goes to the door and opens it body relaxed expecting a bullet
debi moves past him into the room
she is completely calm
he was trying to kill you right
not the other way around
is it something youve done
its something i do
about five years now
stunned get the fuck outta here
seriously when i left i joined the army and took the service exam
they found my psych results fit a certain profile
a certain moral flexibility would be the best way to describe it
i was loaned out to a cia sponsored program
its called mechanical operations
we sort of found each other
youre a government spook
martin says nothing
i was but no
i was before but now im not
its irrelevant really
the idea of governments nations its mostly a public relations theory at this point anyway
but ill tell you something until about five months ago i really enjoyed my work
then i started losing my taste for it
which usually means your time is up
but then i realized it was something entirely different
i started getting the sneaking dark suspicion that maybe there was
meaning to life
great martin thats just great
meaning to life
like that theres a point
an organic connection between all living things
let me help you along martin
youre a sociopath
defensive a sociopath kills for no reason
i kill for money
you never could have kept this from me
i was leaving
thats probably a good idea
will you come with me
im staying here
what if i come back
she goes for the door
she stops at the door
slowly she turns
you dont get to have me
you are a monster im a human being
were not going to mate
you dont understand
thats because i speak human and you speak monster
debi bolts out of the room
martin is left alone
martin looks over at his gear on the bed
after a beat he walks slowly over and surveys his tools
he picks up a cleaning rag and begins to go over the weapons absently singing to himself
whats up doc
whats up doc are you lookin
morning light comes through the slit in the curtains picking up four or five exquisitely clean guns are laid out on the bed almost geometrically spaced
martin lifts one at a time checking their bores and actions
lardner and mccullers gear up
they each finish loading the last of many clips
grocer and company not in a ford passenger van veer off onto an exit ramp
grocer has assembled a team of about nine
they draw different guns from their kit bags and begin loading
lardner and mccullers jam clips into their service autos and knock the slides
martin finished loading his guns and puts them in his case
he shuts it and moves for the door
on the way out he stops and looks himself in the mirror before exiting
each car whooshes by camera on its way to the inevitable
marcella has a cordless tucked between her shoulder and ear and holds a two gallon gas can
she moves from room to room pouring gasoline onto the computers desks and piles of paper stacked on the floor
she adds a splash to her copy of women who run with the wolves
im bringing down the office now
she picks up her hard drive and smashes it on the floor
ill put things right
then ill find you
silence on the line
martin finishes his weapons check and pulls out the dossier
i left you a little something under your desk
martin hangs up
marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink wrapped brick of bills probably a or so
martin makes his way down the road to the newberrys
in the distance he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder away from him
grocer and company are parked off to the side watching newberry in the distance jog toward them
a sniper prepares to blow newberrys head off
as he approaches the figure he recognizes it as newberry he accelerates
grocer spots martins car speeding at newberry
newberry stops jogging and turns to face the town car bearing down on him
his face goes slack expecting to be creamed
martin roars straight at newberry his engine shrieking
as the distance between them turns from yards to feet
martin swerves hard just missing newberry and comes to a halt next to him blocking the snipers line of fire
after a moment newberry opens the passenger door
what the fuck is the matter with you
well i was hired to kill you
its what i do and come to think of it i told you that but
im not going to do it
get in the car
they drive on
its either because im in love with your daughter or because i have a new found respect for life
but i dont know
grocer and company watch in amazement
of martins car disappearing into newberrys long and wooded driveway
that punk is either in love with that guys daughter or he has new found respect for life
martin pulls up in front and stops
both men scramble out and head toward the front door at a quick clip
newberry is shaken martin seems at ease at home in his element
i build cars
theyre paying you to kill me
it was a cost cutting effort
they cant afford a recall
it was a leaky sunroof
a design flaw
i reported a leaky sunroof
you want to kill me because of that
its not me
why does everybody think its personal
they go through the front door and shut it behind them
grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway
lardner and mccullers approach the scene
they get within viewing distance in time to see grocers town car turn into the driveway
well go in through the woods
martins briefcase is open on the large oak table
the contents of the dossier are spilled out onto the table
newberry and debi watch him dumbstruck as he draws a huge desert eagle automatic and jerks back the slide
he turns to debi
i was sitting in my house on prom night wearing that goddamned rented tuxedo a corsage in one hand a bottle of champagne in the other
so i was just sitting there and then the whole night flashed before my eyes and it struck me like a bullet in the head i realized finally and for
the first time that
i wanted to kill somebody
so i figured because i loved you so much thatd itd be a good idea if i didnt see you anymore
but now im different
he turns and points the gun at the front door and fires two shots through it leaving two baseball size holes in the door
martin bolts out of the room toward the back of the house
debi and newberry run as fast as they can away from martin
newberry opens the front door preparing to rush out with debi
they stop at what they see as assassin lies on the porch shot dead through the door by martin
in one hand is a gun in the other is a fuller brush kit
two men grocer and an assassin clamber out of van their guns rising up fast toward us
debi pulls newberry inside slams the front door and locks it
they dive away just before ten rounds hit the door from outside
martin rushes toward the back door which is already opening
a barrel comes through and fires at martin
martin pulls back behind the refrigerator and returns fire
an assassin comes through the door in a crouch and takes cover behind the cooking island
martin yelling back to debi
im in love with you
i know we can make this work
rushes toward the island grabbing an iron skillet off the range and holds it up like a crossing guard stop sign
he steps toward the hidden assassin just as the assassin rises shooting
the skillet takes two rounds before martin hammers the assassins head with it
debi and newberry arrive in the kitchen
martin bashes the skillet into the assassins skull which is beyond our view
he rises spattered with blood and looks at debi
i was afraid to commit to a relationship but now i know im ready to make it happen
martin drops the skillet and grabs newberry and debi gently be the wrists
i just need time to change
he ushers them past the bludgeoned corpse and up the back stairs
he spins and fires twice back down the stairs at another assassin coming up blowing his arms off
he leads them quickly
its not easy for me
i was raised to close off to control my feelings
he takes them into a bedroom and blows away an assassin coming in through the window emptying his auto
martin pushes debi and newberry into an adjoining bathroom
he backs out through the doorway
lock the door
martin starts away but stops to get something straight
i wasnt raised in a loving environment
beat but thats not an excuse
its a reason
martin corners the banister and springs half way down the stairs then hears the front door begin to open
my soul was empty martin jams in another clip and chambers a round
he sees grocer beginning to slip in
and its up to me to fill it
martin fires the twelve round clip into the door until the slide locks back empty again
grocer backs out fast
martin hears a gun report from upstairs and moves back toward it tossing the spent weapon
an assassin slams his body against the bathroom door while debi and newberry scream from within
martin flies at him
the assassin wheels on martin firing
martin pivots out of the line of fire still moving forward
he takes hold of assassins neck and snaps it
martin drops the corpse
through the door its okay
its martin the door begins to open revealing debi and newberry
i know what i do isnt moral per se but if you could just look past that youd see a man worth loving
dont listen to him hes a professional
martin stops short and cocks his head toward grocers muffled voice coming from the vent
youre breaking my heart down here blank
i cant shoot through the tears
martin incensed bends down and takes the gun from the dead man
he runs out of the bedroom gun poised for a kamikaze firefight
lardner and mccullers are poised outside the front door about to enter the mix
mccullers peers through the window
did you see blank in there
for a second there i thought we were in trouble
reaches the top of the front stairs to find grocer heading up the stairs at him
they lift their guns at each other to fire when they hear
power through the front door guns blazing at floor level ala butch and sundance
martin and grocer above spin on them instinctively and fire killing them
grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls out of view
heads up the back stairs
works his way toward grocer moving with stealth toward the kitchen
hears him and starts back down
martin dives behind the cooking island just as grocer comes out of the stairwell blasting
they unload at each other as grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen firing at martin crouched who blasts back
grocer vaults himself through the air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining room still firing
the last casing floats out of the chamber into the air and the slide on the auto locks back empty
flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered serving window his flight carrying him past a television that sits on a lazy susan
martin and grocer sit on the floor backs up against opposite side of the counter martin in the kitchen and grocer in the dining room
the hulking old television sits on the counter above and between them
martin looks up and spies the television how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece
martin takes out a checkbook and tears one free
he wads it into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter
sails over the television and comes down bouncing off grocers head and into his lap
there you go
i left it blank
here they come
grocer pulls two rounds from the clip of his semi automatic and pushes the clip back into the gun
grocer arcs the two bullets into the air
rises and springs at the television gripping it
the two bullets sail past his head
begins to rise from his side of the counter cocking his gun
puts all his weight and motion behind the television
martin and the television careen off of the counter toward grocer
gets off one round before flies onto grocer smashing the seventy five pound television over his goddamn head
martin sails past the collision landing on his back in the dining room
he rolls over to see body crumpled neck is snapped head encased in the shattered picture tube
he is dead
runs up the front stairs retrieving the spent gun he discarded earlier and heads into the bedroom
martin opens the bathroom door
inside debi sits on the edge of the tub her face in her hands
newberry kneels with his arms around her
martin takes this in and walks back into the bedroom
newberry stands and follows him out
martin a bloody tattered mess wipes off the gun and puts it into newberrys hand
newberry in total shock grips it
martin looks past newberry
of debi head in hands
will you marry me
debi doesnt look up
after a moment she reaches out head still down and closes the bathroom door
outside is a michigan autumn
debi sits at her console bringing in the mike as she fades out of a tune
this is wrfn radio free newberry cause thats what it does
bringing you new ones for the nineties a fresh new format designed to pull you out of whats come before and reel you into whats coming soon lights up with
an incoming cal
i tell you whats coming soon for me or at least what i dreamed this morning in that weird time just before you actually wake up
but first this commercial
back after this
she pushes a couple of buttons slaps a cartridge in a player and answers the phone
we hear the commercial over the studio monitor dont miss the show of the season at bilkin community center
a musical for all ages
brigadoon starring carol plummer thomas canchola bob destephano and lee ordman
debi picks up the phone
her face goes slack as she listens
not good not bad
then she hangs up slowly
the commercial ends
a moment of dead air then she snaps to
hey out there
im going to finish up that fantasy later
first ill give you an hour of nonstop music
if i dont come back on after that well nevermind
debi turns on a reel to reel and leaves
debi pulls up and gets out
she begins toward the door but stops dead when she sees sitting on the front steps
debi moves slowly up the walk and sits next to him on the porch
they sit gazing out over the grass and trees beyond
after a while
this will never work out
she turns to him serious
you kill people
beat i have no illusions about the future
what is is
we make choices
and we become the sum total of our choices
i can live with that
other people cant
martin looks at her earnestly
and smiles ever so slightly
she does the same and then just a little wider
he the same
they turn back out to face the lawn and they share a laugh
