beat speed freak
beat thats as good a place as any
beat but first a little background on the mad world of the tweaker
extreme close up of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a glass beaker
methedrene was first distilled by a japanese scientist before wwii
hand it to the japanese they knew a good thing when they saw it
a wide eyed jaw grinding kamikaze pilot with a death grip on the controls
this guys so tweaked he probably thinks he can survive this without a scratch
stock battle footage a japanese zero crashes into a battleship bursting into a ball of flames
beat by some estimates of the japanese population had a meth problem after the war factory workers soldiers pilots
maybe thats why it took two bombs to get em to surrender
a nuclear blast is just a minor nuisance to a determined tweaker
a wide eyed june cleaveresque housewife in a picture perfect white dress vacuums the floor of a picture perfect house
in the fifties the housewives got ahold of it
she attacks the same spot over and over again one hand clutching the vacuum the other stiffly holding a cigarette
danny contd now thats a classic speed freak for you skinny and cleaning the house
ill bet her poor husband never knew what hit him in the sack either
the leg of the bed rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor
stock footage j
pumping the hand of nikita kruschev
there were even rumors that one of our presidents dabbled with mysterious energy shots
imagine that a slammer in the white house
kennedy talking animatedly
danny contd if its true ill bet ol krushchev never got a word in edgewise
a sleepy eyed trucker emerges from his tractor trailer and approaches a loitering hells angels type
by the late s the government finally cracked down and sent the whole thing underground
bikers controlled the market for a while
the trucker gripping the wheel with the same death grip as the kamikaze
but now anyone with a basic chemistry kit and the right ingredients can cook it up at home
a cashier scanning container after container of cold medication
ever see a long haired tattooed freak buying up all the cold medicine he can lay his hands on at three in the morning
the cashier looks up at the aforementioned freak a frozen grin plastered on his face
danny contd take it from me he aint got no cold
hes a cook
look in his kitchen and youll find a whole grocery list of unsavory ingredients
track down the kitchen counter on various containers
drain cleaner hydrochloric acid match heads for red phosphorus ether and of course the cold medicine
thats for ephedrene soon to become methedrene continue tracking to a series of burners beakers and tubing danny contd this guys a regular julia child
problem is ill be even miss julia fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time
the freaky cook sees something he doesnt like
his eyes widen
danny contd oh oh
as the structure explodes
thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows
a huge container of empty beer cans washed and neatly arranged
lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as nails as the nuremberg rally
a group of tweakers in the middle of a binge
two skinny women nancy and teresa bent over a drawer full of neatly folded socks on the living room floor
they stare at the drawer as if they were pondering a rembrandt
it aint right you think
we can do better
they take the socks out and being rearranging them again
three guys squeezed onto a couch together kujo jimmy the finn and creeper
kujo is talking a blue streak
he makes dennis leary took mealy mouthed
creeper and jimmy stare straight ahead clearly bugging
so the alphabet i mean look at it theres letters
why not or or
and the vowels a e i o u
what the hell is up with that
and sometimes y
what im saying is that i love it
i could go on all night about it
and he does
kujo contd lets take every letter individually
i mean lets really break the mothers down
danny is sitting in an armchair
he is the only one who looks tired
he sits there taking the scene in
and so this is where i find myself
i should choose my words more wisely this is the world i sought out
the land of the perpetual night party
day swallowing night and night swallowing day
the crank compressing time like some divine piston on its awesome downstroke
scanning the room
the girls folding the socks
kujo ranting on
creeper and jimmy the finn grinding their jaws
the blankets and tinfoil on the windows
danny contd weve been at this for three days
or is it four
tweakerrs lokers slammers coming and going swearing eternal allegiance and undying love for one another only to wake up after the binge and realize you wouldnt walk across the street
to piss on one of em if their head was on fire
beat is it three days or is it four
back on danny
he blinks lethargically
danny contd i know what youre thinking
but dont give up on me just yet
and for gods sake dont pity me
dont make any judgments until youve seen my whole story
beat and keep your eyes open
beat nothing is what it seems
danny and jimmy the finn walking towards the front door
how the hell did we get this detail
guess its our turn
what time is it
as the door opens danny discovers that it is twelve noon and the sun is blazing
the party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building crammed in the middle of busy business district at a major intersection
jimmy and danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light
i know a guy
lead the way
they slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses
nice day i hadnt noticed
beat ive seen you around

danny and jimmy standing there looking at something off screen
danny and jimmy looking at one another then back at what they were looking at
a guy sitting on the bed in his underwear looking down at his left arm and holding a can of bug spray at the ready in his right hand
he is completely motionless studying his arm with hypnotic intensity
bobby never takes his eyes off his arm
bobby contd whispering theyre coming
likewise whispering what
bobby readies the can of bug spray his eyes widening
bobby contd sing song im ready for you this time
bobby lets loose with the spray dousing his arm
super rapid fire you thought you could fuck with bobby you thought you could fuck with bobby you thought you could fuck with bobby
bobbys mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with bug spray
bobby contd with bobby you thought you could fuck
danny and jimmy wait silently
bobby finally stops spraying satisfied he has killed the imaginary spiders
he looks up at jimmy and danny his eyes swimming with stupid drug addled confusion
bobby contd who the fuck are you
jimmy bobby squints
jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy
rhymes with simmy
what can i do for you
um coupla eight balls oughta do us
danny and jimmy notice something simultaneously
there is something under the mattress a huge bulge
dont pay her no mind
a muffled moan from under bobby
she is between the mattress and the box springs
bobby contd shut the hell up goddamit
bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand
new muffled screams from underneath
bobby contd i got no vocation skills
what the fuck you want from me
keeps slapping i got no vocation skills
hey man take it easy
bobby immediately stops
looks at jimmy with incredulity
ease off the girl
bobby springs from the bed grabbing something as he rises
danny and jimmy suddenly staring at a speargun which is loaded with two stainless steel spears
bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at jimmy then danny
did you bring the plastic men
bobby nods towards something behind danny
danny and jimmy dont move or speak
bobby contd did you bring the plastic men
beat did you bring the plastic men
bobby rubs his nose

bobby tilts his head
danny contd we were hoping to catch a few ourselves if youll hook us up

bobby bobby bobby
he draws a blank hobby
bobby twists a smile revealing speed blackened teeth
thats a good man

calmly hey bobby look
what you got going with your old lay its none of our business

bobby lowers his speargun
two eight balls
jimmy breaths a sigh of relief
danny and jimmy exit the room closing the door behind them
danny looks at jimmy
nice dealer you got there jimmy
ah he was just juiced
he wouldnt have did nothin whap whap
two spears plunge through the cheap door stopping inches from dannys head
they run like hell
the sun plunges down
the sky turns black
the moon races up and down
the sky lightens
the sun races up and down
night comes again
jonestown post kool aid
it looks like they have all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting
danny stirs awake
knocking over a all other sound fades out as the beer splatter to the floor
it is danny staring intently at the spilling liquid
the beer pools up on the floor
danny transfixed by the image
the last few drops of beer loudly splashing down
danny on the phone
number k beat tanner and garcetti he hangs up
danny waiting in the shadows
a car sans headlights pulls into the alley and stops
danny emerges from the shadows opens the back door and lays on the back seat
two guys in suits in the front tanner and garcetti
blue eyes and shaved head an air of ex military around him
garcetti swarthly and serious a miasma of bad ass attitude
lying on the back seat ive got a hot one
you go boy
if its all the same to you id rather not dish right here in the middle of crankville
tanner drives out of the alley
feeling the paranoia tonight are we
well you know what they say just because youre paranoid doesnt mean everyones not out to slice your balls off and shove em down your throat
danny tanner and garcetti outside the car in a deserted park
you got a name
bobby rhymes with hobby
dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts
no last name
it was all pretty informal
didnt have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries
garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges over
this the guy
the humorless garcetti hands danny a wanted poster
bobbys mug shot glaring
hes a lot prettier in person though
cut to the fucking chase flynne
dude is bugging
transparent spiders plastic men the whole nine yards
whats he holding
bobbys hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth
couple of eightballs maybe more
quick shot of an open drawer
a gun can be glimpsed inside
danny contd cheap ass techno knockoff in the drawer with extra mags
another quick glimpse of the closet
a shotgun butt visable danny contd gauge in the closet
the womans hand protruding from underneath the mattress
alas the lovely mrs
bobby was playing the bologna in a posturpedic sandwich beat and there was a kid
a silhouette visible through a crack in the bathroom door
are you sure
a beat up elmo doll and some coloring books on top of the dresser
back on danny
beat oh yeah
he had a spear gun too
god damn flynne you are one observant tweaker
somebody has to help you lazy bastards
garcetti looks at danny with contempt
they head back to the car
danny contd hey tanner

danny im touched
im worried about the kid
then why didnt you help the kid when you were there
hey you want me to do all your work for you numbnuts
garcetti throws danny up against the car
nose to nose
ill tell you why you didnt help because youre a chickenshit tweaking snitch
youre a bottom feader flynne
garcetti youre teeth theyre fucking perfect
garcetti lets danny go
a gaggle of onlookers including a news crew watching from the parking lot
bobbys woman screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a bobbys sheet covered body
a swat team packing up nearby
one of them suddenly does a graceful little tai chi gesture
a little girl clutches at the screaming womans legs
reveal danny amongst the onlookers
his expression gives nothing away
a ribbon of blood snakes from bobbys body over the parking lot curb and runs into a storm drain
as the blood splatters to the bottom mixing with a pool of filthy water
the sound is unnaturally loud
the place cries out you have finally hit the absolute bottom
danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door
a woman one door down from dannys room struggles with her groceries
when she goes to open the door one of the bags breaks spilling its contents onto the floor
danny walks over
approaching let me help you with those
she scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room
slamming the door behind her
danny contd loud through the door and to think miss manner was living down the hall from me and i didnt even know it
there is a can on the floor
danny bends down to pick it up
danny contd hey you left a can of
he looks at the can
the label is in chinese
danny contd some chinese looking shit out here
danny contd ill just leave it by the door here
beat im going now
after a moment the door swings open
danny is holding the can out with a big smile on his face
danny contd you really oughta be more careful
this is not a good neighborhood
the woman smiles
a pretty smile
i was rude
im kinda new around here
you did the right thing
handing the can over what is this stuff anyway
fermented soybean curd
she smiles again
sad and sexy
danny contd my name is danny flynne
off her silence and you are
thank you danny
she closes the door abruptly
the burning room from the opening scene
dannys dirty clothes on the bed
he emerges from the shower a towel wrapped around his waist
there is a big star shaped scar on dannys shoulder
he walks over to the closet takes a metal lockbox from the top shelf and puts it on the bed
pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box
he sits there staring at the contents for a moment then gingerly takes them out
a white dress shirt black slacks and wingtips
danny dresses in his clothes combing his hair
he goes back in the lock box and pulls something else out
a trumpet case
he walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in front of the mirror and stars for a very long time
my name is tom van allen beat i play the trumpet
he slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a gleaming horn inside
runs his fingers along the length of it and up to
a photo of a woman taped to the inside of the lid
a self conscious smile on her face like shes uncomfortable with having her picture taken
danny contd distant my name is tom van allen
i play the trumpet
he takes the trumpet from the case a check from a life insurance company and a drivers license with dannys picture and the name tom danny contd my name is
tom van allen and i play the trumpet
he starts to play
an image appears on the blank wall beside him
move off danny and up in the image a huge lake in the middle of the desert
continue danny and the woman from the photograph sitting on the shore
watching the sunset
she is his wife liz
danny playing saeta on his trumpet
danny and liz are alone except for the myriad birds silhouetted by the falling sun
a gust of wind rushes across the lake blowing lizs hair all around her face
a dying fish on the waterline gills pumping for oxygen
danny finishes playing
not finishing the word melancholy
yes it hurts my heart
what a beautiful composition
and the performance
goofing a virtuoso rendition
tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis haunting moody piece
thank you very much
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it
again i thank you
i was talking about miles
danny playfully tackles her to the ground
you madam are a heartless wench
and youve got wiener breath
its that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch
danny starts kissing her over and over again
she finally pushes him off
he rolls off of her and snuggles up next to her spooning her in the sand
you know how i make that song melancholy when i play it
i think of what my life would be like without you
liz smiles snuggles closer to danny
tom lets spend the night here
theres no motels around here
right here on the beach
lets do it
danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet
the image is still at the vanity whispering okay well stay
on the beach come on liz
well get eaten alive
at the vanity softly no
back on the image as danny and liz walk away from the shore
the sun sinks completely below the horizon
a long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals
the dying fish breaths its last
danny at the vanity closes his eyes
the trumpet goes back in the case
the lid is closed
the case goes back in the box
the neatly folded clothes are laid on top
the box goes back to the shelf
the light in the closet is turned off
danny and tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table
tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out several hundred danny watching silently
tanner puts the bills in an envelope licks the flap seals it and slides it over to danny who doesnt touch it
the envelope lays there between them for the following conversation
you think im a judas
hard to compare the people youre taking down with the lord
garcetti thinks im a pile of shit
garcetti thinks everything is shit
he doesnt even like dolphins
tanner contd im serious
he hates em
you ever hear of anyone who didnt like dolphins
tanner shakes his head and smiles
thanks for not judging me
its not my place
dont you wonder why i do it
keeping yourself out of jail
i know the drill
you dont find that repugnant
just the way the world works
look as far as tweakers go you arent a bad guy
you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know
tell that to bobby
and his wife and kid
bobby laid his own tracks
he could have gone quietly but he played the hard ass con till the end
and as far as im concerned he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him
beat now take the money
danny stuffs the money into his jacket
tanner contd one think i do want to know is how the hell did you get yourself into this position to start with
you seem like a smart enough guy
its a long story
maybe ill tell you all about it some day
garcetti emerges from the mens room zipping up
danny contd hey garcetti

garcetti all business you tell him

garcetti sits down next to danny
mock concern danny its really pains me to have to tell you this but do you remember domingo that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months
what about him
turns out hes connected
the mexicali boys and what does this have to do with me
garcetti puts his hand on dannys shoulder really playing it up
he knows somebody ratted him
and hes making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was
garcetti leans in close garcetti contd you know that thing where they slit your throat and pull your tongue out of the hole
danny knocks garcettis hand away and stands up
garcetti stalks him
garcetti contd apparently they call it a necktie because it hangs down about yay long and looks very similar to a tie
isnt that weird danny
isnt that weird
shut up garcetti
danny turns to tanner if he finds out its me im a dead man
danny he isnt gonna find out its you
domingo was a slinger he must have sold to hundreds of different people
danny paces back and forth
tanner contd and if youre that worried about it maybe you ought to get out of town
how the hell am i gonna do that
you guys are still stringing me a long on that possession charge
mock surprise you mean that hasnt been cleared up yet
garcetti chuckles at dannys fear fuck you garcetti

ive done everything you guys have asked of me
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart ass all the time
look well talk to the a
well get the charges dropped and you can disappear
in the mean time trust me he has no idea that you ratted him out
danny sitting cross legged in front of a gravestone
a pickup truck slowly winds its way up the access road towards danny
danny stands up
dusts his pants off
the truck stops nearby
the strains of garth brooks from inside
the passengers side window rolls down revealing
a bad assed asian dude behind the wheel
he wears a cowboy hat and a rodeo belt
he looks like the chinese marlboro man
this is bubba
an airbrush painting on the door panel a bad likeness of bubba astride a horse dressed as a cowboy with a huge breasted pamela anderson type on the saddle behind
checking out the painting ride em cowboy southern twang you like that
first rate aint it

bubba fires up a cigarette revealing a pock marked face
he carries a gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster
danny contd you consider my presentation

well talk it over
danny climbs in
the window goes back up
as the care pulls away we move back over to the gravestone
the stone reads elizabeth van allen
beloved wife a non descript
cinder block bar
danny sitting at the bar nursing a drink
he looks nervous eyes darting around for potential assassins
he has nothing to worry about with this crowd harmless alcoholics all
jimmy the finn enters and approaches danny
danny signals for jimmy to go to the back then gets up and follows him carrying two beers

danny walking home
sparse traffic on the street
he walks with his head down and his hands thrust in his pockets
a red car approaches from the opposite direction
it slows as it passes danny
danny looks over
the driver is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight but it is obvious that he is staring right at danny
danny plays it cool
the red car pulls a slow u turn
danny hauls ass
the red car catching up
danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a series of apartment complexes
the red car follows slowly prowling the street
danny squeezed behind a dumpster watching
it is now too dark to see the driver
the car comes to a stop
danny hugging the dumpster tight
another car pulls into the tight street behind the red car
the driver of the other car sounds his horn
the red car speeds off
danny walks quickly the other way
a way too young black kid stares directly at camera an array of handguns knives rifles and security equipment spread out on the dining room table before him

an argument ensues next door between the dude and colette
the sounds of a struggle
the dude yelling at the top of his lungs
a loud smack
the dude talking in hushed tones contrite
a spray painted rusty chevy vega belching black smoke
all of the lights are broken
danny in the passengers seat looking down at
the floorboard or lack thereof
it is completely rusted out
the freeway rushes by underneath

danny wonders what hes getting himself into
jimmy contd you know they say he hasnt slept in over a year

a sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert
a guy passes out in the front yard
a dog sniffs at him then starts pissing on him
he never moves
a pile of dead pigeons near the driveway
close on pooh bear he does indeed have a prosthetic nose
it almost blends in with his face but not quite making it that much more disconcerting
he takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe holds it then blows a long exhale
okay here we go gentlemen
a remote controlled car trundles out of the garage and along the driveway
inside the car four piegeons their bodies wrapped in tape
pooh bear working the remote control device
pooh bear contd zapruder
a guy filming the whole thing with a super camera
grainy super footage the pigeons continue along their stupid eyes glazed with confusion
another guy sighting a scoped pellet gun
a third guy aiming a pellet gun further down and to the right of oswald
ready third shooter
the third shooter is also armed with a pellet gun its a go
pooh bear watches anxiously
president kennedy waving to the crowd his lovely wife looking radiant beside him as they turn into dealey plaza
grainy footage the car making a turn the pigeons oblivious
pooh bear contd stand by gentlemen
beat eyes widening steady
the three men open up simultaneously
grainy footage a mass of feathers flying as the pigeons are hit

danny jimmy kujo and creeper sitting in a booth
jimmy and creeper are amped jaws grinding eyes bugging
kujo rambles on but danny isnt listening
he looks exhausted his face is pinched there are bags under his eyes
he scans the bar stopping on
colette and her trashy dude boyfriend colette sees danny looking
smiles at him
danny returns the smile until the trashy dude looks over
danny looks away

danny amused by the conversation
he sees something out of the corner of his eye
the boyfriend kissing colette roughly
she obviously isnt enjoying it
danny watching intently
kujo contd danny come on
if im gonna let you in on the opportunity of a lifetime the least you can do is pay attention
danny turns back to the table
kujo slides another glass over
kujo contd this is the courier you should use something smaller
hes the same size as the office
it doesnt ring true
kujo rolls his eyes
he uses a peanut instead
and the colored girls sing doot de doot
a courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case
he delivers at four oclock on the nose every friday
alpha team will be in the elevator with the courier
thatll be danny and creeper
move into the elevator creeper standing in the corner alone asleep on his feet drool trickling down his mouth
kujo contd every member of the team will be equipped with night vision goggles a police scanner and two way radios
the elevator door closes on the dosing creeper
he slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut
kujo contd number two team which will be me and jimmy will be positioned in the stairwell at the other end of the hall
kujo slides over two more peanuts
the trashy dude heads into the bathroom
danny sneaks another look at colette
this time she gives him a big smile
kujo emerges from the stairwell also alone approaching the courier
he is wearing shorts a tank top and after ski boots
he has a big powdery crank donut around his nostrils
kujo contd with alpha team following from the elevator number two team will approach from the stairwell cutting the courier off before he reaches the lab
creeper still fast asleep inside the elevator
he wakes with a start breaking down into a karate stance
the courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the cashew
kujo contd facing superior numbers and an array of high tech weapons the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands
kujo and the courier playing tug of war with the case
kujo points a dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun
jimmy listening intently takes some of the peanuts
jesus jimmy you at the alpha team
i thought you were done
jimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the table
i said hey sugar take a walk on the wild side
kujo contd now heres the beautiful part
both teams will rappel right down the center of the stairwell change clothes and walk right out the front door like nothing happened
kujo tumbling head over heals down the metal steps
he gets to his feet a bloody mess
the kit has sprung open sending shit samples everywhere
kujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs off
kujo bolts out the front door into the street and directly into the path of
an oncoming ambulance which drags him underneath for a good fifty feet
danny watches as the trashy dude exits the bathroom
so whats it gonna be danny boy
you in or out
trashy dude goes to colette
it looks like he wants to leave and she doesnt
kujo contd danny
trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck lifts her off the stool and pushes her out the front door
watching colette im afraid im gonna have to pass on this one boys
danny watches her exit
danny approaches his door
colette is sitting in the hall head in hands sobbing
danny starts to say something
goes to this door
danny contd well

danny starts to enter again
danny contd why are you out here
quincey my boyfriend
he kicked me out
danny isnt quite sure what to do
he takes a half step towards her
id like to help you out

she looks up

danny and colette in a near deserted retro coffee shop
a lone waitress and cook mull behind the counter
colettes mascara is running
danny hands her a napkin
she dabs at her eyes
colette contd im so embarrassed
she looks at herself in a compact mirror
jesus i look like a raccoon
i was thinking alice cooper
she puts her head in her hands
come on cheer up
it could be worse
she looks up
i dont know
you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hopes stool specimen
she laughs danny contd see
no matter how bad things are theres always someone a little worse off
what about the guy on the very bottom
leave me out of this
that bad huh
danny holds up his water glass
nevertheless i still try to see the glass as half full
he takes a sip
danny contd problem is its usually half full of something that tastes a lot like urine
he pulls a face
sets the glass down
could be worse
beat oh sorry forgot who i was talking to
colette sips her coffee
danny looks around nervously
danny contd hey did i mention that i was a coward
colette frowns not sure what he means
danny contd quincey

this man sounds like a real catch
oh hes a keeper all right
look its really none of my business but why dont you just dump this guy

the waitress and cook look up
colette contd is that simple enough for you

they dont hold him for more than a day or two
thats long enough to get out of town
ive got a kid
she lives with my parents
quincey knows where they live
danny chews it over for a second then
then make sure he gets put away for longer
danny hesitates not sure of how much he wants to get involved
colette contd tell me how
i dont know
beat let me think about it
urban blight abounds the grafitti filled cluttered shell of what used to be some sort of offices
bubba the asian cowboy sitting on a desk
danny pacing back and forth in front of him
texas drawl i wanna do a small buy first
well see how it goes
the guys is ready to deal now
because i dont know him and i dont really know you partner
now thats down right insulting
ill have to live with that
my money my risk my rules
bubba takes a plastic wrapped bundle of money from his pocket
tosses it on the table
tanner and garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street
garcetti pointing a long range parabolic microphone at the burned out building
he and tanner wear earpieces which are attached to the mike
filtered broken i guess i dont have a hell of a lot of choice
filtered get used to it
youre in a very tenuous position on the food chain hoss
garcetti removes his earpiece and turns to tanner
you thinking what im thinking
this could be the one were looking for
bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner
danny now alone
he picks up the bundle of cash
turns to leave when tanner and garcetti enter the building
danny turns and runs the other way
hold it right there flynne
jesus you almost gave me a heart attack
danny secretly pockets the bundle of cash
what the hell are you doing here
question is what are you doing here
i was trying to score some dope
cut the shit flynne
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here
okay asshole you wanna play well play
tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves
serious what did i do
tanner approaches him
danny backs into a corner
danny contd this is a joke right
you put him up to this garcetti
garcetti is mum
tanner raises his fists
danny covers his face
danny contd come on tanner
tanner starts swinging but something unexpected
the punches have absolutely no effect
danny cant help it
he starts laughing
tanner throws some more creampuffs
garcetti shakes his head with shame
shrieking failing you think this is funny motherfucker
still laughing and covering up i cant help it tanner you hit like a fucking girl
this makes tanner even madder
his punches become wilder and even less effective
garcetti do something
garcetti tires of the whole show
he pulls a small shock gun from his pocket switches it on and sticks danny behind the neck with it
danny crumples to the floor
tanner kicks him in the face
garecetti squats down next to danny
we know whats going on
in pain i still dont know what youre talking about
garcetti jams the stun gun into dannys crotch
garcetti lays off
danny lays there whimpering
okay let me help you
youre setting up a deal with a chinese redneck
quarter of a million
garcetti holds up a tap
garcetti contd we just listened to the whole thing
danny gaped mouthed
he cant believe it
garcetti contd somebody tipped up dipshit
who the hell is jimmy
hes the only one i told
and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one
you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker flynne
might just as well broadcast it on the evening news
danny sitting on a crate
he is sporting a black eye from where tanner kicked him
garcetti at the desk dusting the plastic wrapper on the bundle of cash for prints
tanner paces back and forth in front of danny
i met the guy at a party
he said he wanted to do a biggie
hes new in town so i offered my services

tanner rolls his eyes
danny contd i swear

garcetti suppresses a smile

sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens flynne
oh theyre all that and the proverbial bag of chips

minus five for a certain blabber mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn whos living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory
tanner looks at danny quizzically
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off
look man i just wanted to make some dough and disappear
i didnt want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him
danny holds his hands up danny contd but now ive seen the error of my ways
ill just walk away
call the whole deal off
he tosses the bundle of cash to danny
you mean you want me to roll on these guys
their silence is answer enough
danny contd no

intent to buy and distribute worth of crank
whats the mandatory on that al
move off garcetti and over to a wall mounted heating vent
move into the vent then
out of a vent in another room
bubba lurking in the shadows
listening to the conversation through the wall vent in the other room
and believe me word will get out that youre a pro rat
thats not good in prison
its just not good
bubba listens intently
danny hunkered down in the back sea
garcetti sniffing the air
whats that smell
that would be me
whatd you do piss your pants
what the hell do you expect zapping mr
johnson with that crackler
garcetti looks back at danny with a twisted smile
whod have thought it
danny chickenshit flynne trying to go large right under our noses

youve got me all wrong
i mean in you own pussified way you actually got some nuts in your little sack

news flash tanner
im a fucking rat
you think youre so god damned smart dont you
the dynamic has suddenly changed in the trios relationship
tanner is now the bad cop
tanner contd well you played the wrong mark this time asshole
danny approaching the building we hear shots
the red car from earlier prowling the streets
danny ducks into a liquor store and watches from the window
the red car cruises slowly past
danny squinting trying to make out
the license plate number
a street light illuminates the tag momentarily
a vanity plate iforgiv
danny frowns not sure that to make of it
colette and quincey lying in bed
the lilting sound of dannys trumpet wafting in the air
quincey is fast asleep
colette lays there eyes open listening to the coolly hypnotic strains of miles davis generique
danny in his good clothes sitting in front of the mirror playing his trumpet staring at the photos of his wife
colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms around her knees
she closes her eyes and leans her head against the wall soaking in the music
danny continues playing
he sneaks down a look at
a greeting card on the vanity in front of him
the word congratulations printed on the front
the flashback imgery appears on the wall behind him again
move from danny to the image as we
the car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road
liz in the passenger seat looking pissed
the salton sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a full moon
why didnt you just ask for directions back there
come on wheres your pioneer spirit
you mean like the donner party
hey do you think you could eat me if you had to
and if so which part do you think you would find the most delicious
tom quit fucking around
peering through the windshield theres a house up there
ill go ask for directions
a dilapidated house further up in the hills lights glowing
liz sees the run down old house
you think thats a good idea
what do you mean
look at that place
danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house
first you want me to ask for directions then you dont
which is it
i wanted you to ask back there
you know before you got us lost
just no pleasing you is there
just admit youre wrong
we all know how much you like hearing that
okay liz i was wrong
quit feeling sorry for yourself tom
it gets old
you know what gets old
being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up
here it comes poor tom
but thats okay liz youre the one with the steady job you pay all the bills
im just an unemployed musician
you have every right
that is so unfair
danny stares straight ahead steering the car towards the house
my sentiments exactly
why are you doing this
danny doesnt answer
liz contd i never once asked you to stop playing
i wouldnt dream of it
so dont take your low self esteem out on me
danny continues to ignore her
tell me when youre ready to apologize
danny lying on the bed reliving the moment
the image still projected on the bed whispering im sorry liz
i love you and im sorry
but the danny in the image never answers
it is raining buckets outside
danny sleeping soundly
the roof of dannys room is leaking puddling up on the floor near his dannys eyes pop open
he lays there rigidly
listening to the water
the bar is almost empty
danny quietly playing chords on a beat up old upright piano in the back of the room the through line of davis all blues
this seat taken
danny looks up
what happened to your eye
turns out im allergic to steel toed boots
beat by the way im not looking for a matching set
off her puzzled look wheres quincey
hes out of town
how far out of town
colette sits down on the piano bench next to danny
colette contd please keep playing
she sits there listening for a few moments
colette contd thats nice
what is it
never heard of him
just a fucked up guy who played beautiful music
im strictly minor league
except for the fucked up part
danny continues to play
dude played his soul right out the end of the horn
no false notes
and you admire that
its the only way to play
colette slides closer
is that how you play
no false notes
she pulls even closer
no deep dark secrets
she goes to kiss him
danny stops playing
pulls away from her
cold and abrupt what are you up to
what do you want from me colette
i dont want anything
why are you so suspicious
it gets me through the day
you really need to lighten up
she puts her hand on his leg
colette contd just relax
he moves his leg away
look i cant help you with quincey if thats what youre after
this has nothing to do with him
so youre just attracted to me is that it
why do you find that so hard to believe
how much time do you have
what is wrong with you
how much time do you have
youve got a comeback for everything dont you danny
you use em like some sort of shield
who the fuck are you
there you go again
youre nothing but false notes
you dont like the tune find another station
what are you hiding danny
therapy session is over
he closes the keyboard cover
you think youre the only one down here with a sad story
but im the only one with my sad story
beat and thats how its gonna stay
tanner negotiates the slow traffic
danny looking at a mug shot of pooh bear
garcetti harlan dale monty a
did five years manslaughter for beating a pimp to death with an electric wheelchair
several possession charges but nothing major
why doesnt palmdale p
just raid the guy
but they never found a lab
thats because he doesnt have one
whata you mean
he told me guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers
as least thats what the word is
whats to stop him from just ripping me off then
thats probably what he would have done if we hadnt found out about your get rich quick scheme
youre lucky flynne
funny i dont feel lucky
were coordinating with palmdale p
well have your sorry ass covered
what if he caps me before you can make a move
golly i hadnt thought of that

danny doesnt look reassured
speaking of which
you run that license plate for me

garcetti and tanner exchange a smile
is it bad
im afraid so danny
who is it
dannys eyes dart back and forth between garcetti and tanner
who is it
beat a teacher
garcetti and tanner break out laughing
car is registered to a mrs
danny reacts to the name not listening to the rest of what garcetti and tanner have to say
shes and shes been teaching third grade for the last years
now thats scary
danny lost in thought
youre paranoid flynne
i think that crank is finally starting to get the best of you
danny waiting on the corner
when is the deal going down
im making the small buy tonight
if i dont get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something
if everyone is happy well do the big deal later in the week
jimmys vega sputters to a stop in front of danny
jimmy gets out and hands danny the keys
on the bumpter a hand made sign
it reads pull me over
i dare you
walks to the back rips the sign off and gets in the car leaving jimmy with the sign
you sure you dont want me to go with you
danny burns rubber
danny being led towards a trailer by two of pooh bears men
little bill and big bill
little bill is big and big bill is little
pooh bear sitting in a recliner obscured by shadows when danny and his escorts enter
a wire cage in the corner something moving around inside
it too is obscured by shadows
pooh bear doesnt look up
he is preoccupied with something in his hand which he is cleaning with a toothbrush
pooh bear my man
pooh bear doesnt respond
comin down from a day ride
danny closes his eyes
not what he wanted to hear
you want to do this some other time
gloomy and tired pull your pants down
pull your motherfucking pants down
danny looks to the two bills for help
laughing nervously come on guys
big bill pulls a th century double barreled flintlock pistol from his jacket and points it at dannys head
im a pirate
little bill little bill drops dannys trousers
danny about to object when he is started into silence
the saturnine pooh bear raises his head illuminating his face
he isnt wearing his prosthetic nose
a gaping hole where his nose should be
he looks like some obscene human bat
pooh bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning inspecting it under the light
pooh bear contd introduce him to captain steubing
he pops his nose back into place but it goes on crooked
the bills escort danny over to the cage
there is a gigantic crazed the cage is divided by a large piece of plexiglas
pooh bear contd youll have to excuse him he aint ate for over a week
the weasel is foaming at the mouth
pooh bear contd that and the rabies
dont make for a happy weasel
trying to stay calm pooh bear
come on man
what is this
off pooh bears silence its me danny
i thought we had a deal
big bill big bill pushes danny up to the cage which comes up to about waist level
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police
pooh bear holds up his hand
dont address me
i didnt make the accusation
i dont know what youre
uh uh uh
he points to the cage
danny looks down at the weasel which is trying to gnaw through the plexiglas
to the weasel um
im not working for the cops
the weasel continues to gnaw
he dont believe you
drop your package in the cage
put your pee pee through the hole
there is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the plexiglas from captain steubing
this is fucking crazy
big bill pulls back the hammer on the gun
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum
dannys eyes dart quickly over to little bill who like everyone else is watching the weasel
little bill is wearing a big filthy pea coat with a large tear on the side
danny still hasnt complied with pooh bears order
from behind we see danny bend slightly dropping his privates into the cage
danny contd eyeing the wild rodent oh my god
oh my fucking god
danny tries to stay calm shoots another look at little bill who is standing right next to him
now get talkin i didnt fucking do anything
i swear to god
pooh bear leans forward and opens the plexiglas partition about half an inch
the weasel bolts for the opening gnashing its teeth trying to squirm through
you got something to tell captain steubing youd better do it now
the weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the plexiglas
danny uses the diversion
he quickly takes something from him own jacket pocket and slips it in the hole in little bills jacket between the coat and the lining
no one notices
pooh bear opens the plexiglas even more
the weasel is able to get his head through the hole
he bares his filthy teeth
rapid fire captain steubing listen to me
youre after the wrong guy
this is the fuck you should be talking to
he nods towards little bill
pooh bear cocks his head
danny contd jimmy told me that little bills been shorting pooh bear
settin up his own stuff on the side
thats a pack of discharge
danny now makes eye contact with pooh bear who listens intently
jimmy saw him flashing a pimp role at a bar the other night
said he was dissin your ass in front of one of your customers
pooh bear rises slowly
approaches the triumvirate
danny keeps one eye on
the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening
manll say a lot of thing when hes sporting weasel food for a pecker
least i can do is check it out though
pooh bear pulls a chrome
from his waistband
can i pull my dick out now
pooh bear limply aims the
at little bill
pooh bear contd big bill big bill pats little bill down
holding up his arms go ahead
i got nothing to hide
big bill checks all of little bills pockets coming up empty
the weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole
can i pull my dick out
danny panicked eyes the hole in the pea coat
danny cant believe it
but when little bill lowers his arms a big roll of cash protrudes from the hole
pooh bear and big bill see it immediately
he follows their gaze to the cash
eyes on little bill yeah
danny extracts himself from the cage just as
the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in the cage
danny sitting at the kitchen table
the screams of little bill audible danny is fiddling with something under the table when he hears pooh danny finishes up stuffing a roll of duct tape into his pocket
pooh bear drops a zip lock bag of meth on the table
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now
dont do that
or ill kill you
what the hell was that
who told you i was five
it was just a test
i need to be sure of who im dealing with from time to time
pooh bear nudges the baggie towards danny
pooh bear contd take it easy
danny hands over the bundle of cash
pockets the dope
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didnt do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel
ill keep that in mind
move under the table dannys glock taped to the underside out of sight
danny garcetti and tanner
tanner doing a chemical test on the meth with a field kit

danny looks up
took a pig slicker to the heart
i thought youd be happy
he doesnt look happy
domingo sprawled face down on the tile floor of the shower room
blood leaking from underneath him
the red car with iforgiv plates parked in the driveway of a modest spanish style house
nancy and verne plummer watching tv
photos of liz on top of a baby grand piano
a shrine of sorts
catholic icons abound crucifixes virgin marys needle point prayers
a knock on the door
nancy gets up to answer

nancy and verne look at one another
danny and verne sitting at the dining room table
nancy brings in a pot of coffee
verne eyes danny silently
danny wont look him in the eye
all right nancy howd you track me down
billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago
said you looked so bad he barely recognized you
nancy pours the coffee
nancy contd billys a cop now you know

maybe i should just go
danny pushes away from the table
nancy grabs dannys wrist
we want to help you tom
danny stays put
nancy contd i know everyone deals with grief in their own way
i know how hard it is to find closure
how do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter
i gave my grief to jesus christ
is that what you want me to do
put it all on jesus
let him sort it out in the afterlife
youve got to deal with this sooner or later tom
you cant keep hiding
maybe i am dealing with it
i know its not my place to pass judgement on you but
danny looks at the shrine to liz on top of the piano
then why dont i see any pictures of me up there
that was my idea
you never did like me much did you verne
beat and you cant stand it that i walked out of there alive and liz didnt
you think im a coward dont you
vernes silence is answer enough
danny contd i dont blame you for hating me
at least i understand that
back to nancy but forgiving the butchers who killed liz well im having some trouble with that one
love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you a persecute you
danny touches nancys hand tenderly
im genuinely happy that you found some peace nancy
but you cant forgive for liz
no one can
and you cant forgive for me
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker
i dont buy that
theres a place for hatred
beat did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed
i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her
do you know what that feels like
its not too late to show her youre sorry
verne slams his hand down on the table
by not disgracing her memory
what does that mean
you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose
or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter
verne glares at danny
no forgiveness in his heart
verne contd you ever think you might be buying drugs from the very people who took her life
you dont understand
danny starts to say something
i just want you to know
im not what you think i am
danny sitting at a table the lockbox open in front of him
he is endorsing the back of a life insurance check
his tom van allen drivers license laying next to it
who is it
im kind of busy
please open the door danny
he pockets the check and the license closes the lockbox and goes over to the door
colette standing on the other side
her face and arms are black and oh jesus
he lets her come in
colette looks away
danny contd colette

colette cracks a crooked smile
from day one

he gently touches her eye
colette reaches up and touches dannys bruised eye
colette contd look at us

colette leans in to kiss him but they bump bad eyes
can we try that again
they kiss again
deep and long
danny suddenly pulls back mid kiss
colette goes to touch him
he pulls away
danny contd i cant
i just cant
danny paces uncomfortably
whats wrong danny
look maybe you oughta leave
i want to know what the hell is going on
i cant tell you
colette comes to a slow realization
theres someone else isnt there
the flashback imagery suddenly flickers to life on the wall behind danny the moonligh salton sea
looks up at colette
colette waits a beat then turns to leave
danny contd dont go
beat please colette
she stops stay and talk to me please
something about dannys voice a raw vulnerability which we havent seen in him before
move off of danny and onto the flashback image
im so tired of lying
dannys car parked out front
a chubby guy sitting on the couch in his underwear watching a mexican western
he sits there with wide eyes grinding his jaws
danny liz and bo the affable owner of the house looking at a map on the kitchen table
what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom
itll take you right to the highway
are you australian
i fucking hate australians
danny and liz share a look
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road
first door on the right
it aint that dirty
just kinda filthy is all
to liz you mind
no i dont mind
thats how come i told you about it
i was talking to my wife
try to make it fast
danny heads down the hallway liz looks a little uncomfortable
liz contd trying to make small talk so
what do you do for a living around here
this and that
bo scratching his arms
liz notices track marks all over bos arms
he sees her looking
theyre bad up here
danny peeing when he hears another car pull up outside
car doors open danny finishes up
he steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom window
danny frowns not sure what to make of it
he steps down from the tub and is just about to exit when the front doors is kicked open and shots danny freezes not sure what to do
his eyes dart around for a weapon
he picks up a large plumbers wrench and goes to the bathroom door
several bullets slam through the bathroom wall one striking danny in the shoulder
he slumps to the floor
the pandemonium continues in the front room
there is a bullet hole about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall next to dannys head
he puts his eye to the hole and looks out
through the hole scanning the room
in the confusion she has managed to hide from the intruders
she is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall
she clings tightly to the curtains her hands shaking violently
one the curtain rings pulled taught by lizs grip
danny adjusts his gaze through the hole
through the hole scanning to the other side of the room
bo and the other guy sprawled on the floor
intruder one stands over them only his legs visible
back on liz scared to death clinging to the curtains
the curtain rings are pulled to the breaking point
intruder two emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag
they start to head out the front door when
one of the curtain rings breaks with a metallic ting
on danny freaking
his eyes shooting back to liz
then the creaking footsteps of intruder one approaching
it takes an eternity
liz cant possibly see danny through the hole but it looks like she is staring directly at him her body rigid with fear
danny grabs the wrench again
tries to get to his feet but slips back down either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared
his hand is shaking violently
he looks through the hole again
through the hole liz still staring at danny
the footsteps contence at a agonizing slow pace then stop
a gun ever so slowly enters frame
extreme close up on lizs eyes as they widen
extreme close up on dannys eye peering through the hole
a shot is fired
his eye closes
on danny his mouth opens to scream but nothing comes out
and with that it is all over
danny tries to get to his feet again
fails his eyes flutter
all is silent except for a faint liquid spattering
long shot back on the salton sea placid and silvered with moonlight
danny and colette face to face in profile silhouetted by the image of the sea
she died knowing that i was a coward
that i didnt lift a finger to help her
there was nothing you could have done
she is inches closer to him
no youre wrong i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up
i could have done something
they would have killed you too
finally looks her in the eye nothing could be worse then this slow death im living now
colette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight
the image of the sea flickers and fades behind them
close on danny holding colette
looking up colette
i want to help you with quincey
colette pulls back
no danny dont danny contd but you gotta be serious about it
really i dont want to
i want to do this for you
i want to do something good for a change
danny goes over to the dresser
takes out a baggie of meth
danny contd i want you to hide this somewhere where quincy wont find it
what is it

he holds out the baggie
colette backs away
i dont want to
danny stalks her
im offering you the chance to take care of your problems
she still hesitates dont make the same mistake i did colette
do something while you have a chance
do it for your daughter before something happens
beat believe me you dont want to live with this burden
firm he helds the baggie out again
colette reluctantly takes it from him
danny contd tommorrow night when he is asleep
i want you to beep me at this number
he writes the number down on a dollar bill
will you do that
off her nod then i want you to get out of the room
dont worry about it
just go across the street and watch
youll know when its safe to go back
colette goes to protest
danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way she did to him earlier

all your problems with quincey will be taken care of
empty except for danny and jimmy in a back booth
danny slides an envelope over to jimmy

jimmy and danny squinting in the mid morning sun

jimmy the finn
tanner and garcettis car parked on the periphery
danny in the back seat dialing a cell phone
a microreceiver attached tanner and garcetti listening through earpieces
bubba answers a cell phone on the other end

danny hands the phone back to garcetti nervous

danny watches them drive away
when he is sure that they are gone he looks around
a plumbers truck parked on the other side of the park
an hispanic guy behind the wheel
hes coming in
as danny approaches the truck the door slides open
he piles in
howd it go

danny pulls a tiny microphone and wire from inside his shirt and hands it to
bubba who sits in front of a bank of listening equipment
you ready to go meet the team
the plumbers truck enters the underground parking lot
agents in a small conference room looking at
danny and bubba sitting at the head of the table
bubba is now wearing his security badge which reads special agent tex trahn
he stands up and addresses the group
and he really does have a southern accent
for those of you who dont know this is tom van allen
danny looks self conscious
trahn contd about a year and half ago mr
van allens wife was murdered at a meth lab out near the salton sea
no one was ever apprehended for the crime but local authorities have always assumed it was a hit and grab perpetrated by rival drug dealers
that is until tom here took it upon himself to conduct a one man undercover operation at great risk to his own personal safety
one of the agents pipes up
hes a civilian
off trahns nod how the hell did you pull this off
trahn turns to danny
i played the long shot
just got lucky
danny and detective bookman a homicide detective sitting at a table
how about the car
danny shakes his head
bookman contd was it a truck
all i saw was the headlights
the high beams were on
not even a guess
pissed off how many times do we have to go through this
another detective enters the room hands something to bookman then whispers into bookmans ear
bookman contd you said one of the perpetrators crossed in front of the headlights

on the other side of the pump a red haired man with a bad comb over
the brightest reddest hair youve ever seen with a big streak of white his back is turned

his arm and hands resting on top of the pump
danny looks at the guys hand
a guady class ring on his finger el danny staring absently at the red hair in the baggie

danny feigns frustration
danny contd im sorry

danny sitting at a table poring over a yearbook for the class of

danny garcetti and tanner at the picnic table talking
i gave up whoever they asked for whenever they wanted
i was a fucking dream rat
but the whole time i was sizing them up looking for any evidence that they were the guys who killed my wife
danny watching from the shadows as tanner and garcetti haul a dope dealer away in cuffs
but they did everything by the book
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for id have to set up a deal so sweet they wouldnt be able to walk away from it
thats when he called me
he told me his story and he pitched me a plan
these guys are smart
i knew they wouldnt hit a deal unless they knew all the players

tanner and garcetti watching battle enter the building

tanner pulls the car in behind a rock formation on the bluff
tanner kills the engine
garcetti checks his watch
half an hour to kickoff
tanner takes a pair of night vision binoculars from under the seat
trahn pulls into the lot
he emerges from the car with his briefcase looks around then heads down to the room
trahn checks his watch then knocks on the door
danny sitting with his back to trahn
trahn contd any word from pooh bear
danny shakes his head
trahn contd you okay hoss
trahn walks over to danny who sits there with his head down his face obscured by a baseball cap
slowly he looks up
trahn contd what the hell

tanner scanning with the night vision glasses
here he comes
reveal that the car is on a bluff above pooh bears compound
danny pulls up in a rental car
dannys hand is shaking uncontrollably
he looks at his hand again
it continues to shake
he takes a deep breath
as danny gets out of the car and goes to the trunk
maybe he isnt showing
danny takes a gym bag out of the trunk and approaches pooh bears house
looks like flynnes handling the cash
lets get into position
they get out of the car and trek down the bluff towards the house
big bill lets danny in then pats him down for weapons
satisfied he leads danny to the kitchen
in the kitchen danny enters and stops
a worried look
pooh bear along with three other men
the men eye danny silently
they look like ex cons
what the hell is this
just some buddies
this is bullshit
you didnt say anything about anybody else being here
what the fuck are you gonna do about it dickhead
the other guys snicker one of them almost spitting his beer out
danny smiles good naturedly
shoots a look over at
one of the guys sitting where he taped his gun earlier
come on man lets deal
he throws the bag on the table knocking a beer into the guys lap
the guy springs up pissed off
we got business
danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat
under the table danny fumbling with the gun trying to untape it without being too obvious
pooh bear unzips the bag
inside a lot of cash
oh my oh my
beat big bill come take a look at this
big bill is behind danny over by the sink
he pulls his flintlock and walks over
danny continues trying to get the gun loose
something catches his eye the microwave oven door is open casting a reflection of the room behind him
big bill approaches danny pointing the gun at dannys head
the other men ease back from the table a little
under the table danny still cant get the gun loose
on the reflection big bill right behind danny
he raises the flintlock
he rips at the gun
big bill goes to fire
using the reflection danny ducks at the last instant
big bill fires
the guy across the table takes the mini ball in the chest
all in an instant danny extricates the gun
turns on big bill who sees the gun and holds his hands up
danny shoots twice the bullets blowing through big bills hands and thumping into his chest
big bill crumples
when pooh bear goes to pull his gun from his waist band it discharges shooting him in the thigh
the muzzle flash ignites his pants leg
pooh bear hits the floor screaming slapping at the fire on his leg
danny wheels on the other two guys at the table who are going for their guns
danny opens up on them with the glock flooring them before they can get a shot off
outside still descending the bluff tanner and garcetti hear the gunfire
inside danny turns on pooh bear who sits there staring at his injured leg
danny puts the gun to pooh bears head closes his eyes and starts to pull the trigger
pooh bear lifts his gun and shoots danny in the torso three times
pooh bear gets to his feet
oh lordy oh lordy oh lordy
pooh bear done shot himself
hes in shock
he grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers down the hallway into the living room
outside tanner and garcetti at the front door listening
they pull their ski masks on take out their guns then silently enter
inside gunsmoke abounds
one of the guys moans on the floor
tanner and garcetti enter the kitchen guns drawn and ready
they survey the scene
big bill lays there dying staring with confusion at the stigmata in his hands
danny lying in a heap next to big bill
suddenly they hear pooh bear mumbling from somewhere in the house
tanner signals for garcetti to take point
they head down the long hallway slowly and silently
when they are gone
danny stirs on the floor
his eyes open
he opens his shirt and checks his torso revealing that he is wearing his bullet proof vest
he struggles to a sitting position in great pain from the impact bruises left by the bullets
he picks up his gun gets up on wobbly legs and follows tanner and garcetti down the hall
on danny as he creeps down the hall
exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room
he stops at the end of the hall
his eyes go wide with fear and revulsion
liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch
her head is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch
she looks fine
there is even a slight smile on her lips
danny contd liz
then he notices it
a widening pool of blood seeps from under the couch like some living thing
more blood patters down from some unseen wound on the side of her head
danny staggers towards her
her eyes flutter slightly
danny sits next to her
holds her hand
there is nothing he can do
liz tries to speak
im here liz
she squeezes his hand
then goes limp
danny continues down the hall remembering
danny sitting there with liz in a pool of blood
he notices something on the floor
lizs purse the contents spilled on the floor
a greeting car with a teddy bear and the word congratualtions on the front
danny goes over and picks up the card
he opens it
youre a daddy
a home pregnancy test taped inside the reading is positive
danny drops the card
stares down at it as
the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card
on the placid sea as dannys horrific scream resounds from the house in the distance
on danny standing in the hallway staring his face a blank
on pooh bear cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred dollar bill
he draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a remote
pooh bear prepares to dose looking for a vein in his neck never noticing
garcettis gun moving to the back of pooh bears head
pooh bear about to plunge the drugs when garcetti fires
pooh bear pitches forward dead
the syringe falls to the floor
tanner and garcetti standing over him
they pull their ski masks off
get the bag
garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the floor
garcetti contd lets get out of here
garcetti goes down where he stands
he lays there twitching like a rabbit
tanner staring down the suckers end of dannys gun
my name is tom
danny contd tom van allen danny raises his gun
whatever you say man
can we talk about this
beat youre in the bathroom
youve been shot in the shoulder
danny shoots tanner in the shoulder
he collapses to the floor
on garcetti his eyes flutter and open
danny walks over to tanner and stands above him
danny contd theres two guys with masks and guns in the other room about to kill your wife
tanner looks at danny confused
danny contd but you know if you go out there theyll kill you too
youll both die

tanner realizes what danny is talking about
danny contd do you go out there and die like a man or do you live to fight another day
tanner doesnt answer
danny contd what do you do

danny contd answer the question
tanner is ghost white loosing blood quickly
danny contd what do you do

when danny goes to shoot tanner again
tanner pulls a k bar knife from the back of his belt and plunges it into the back of dannys gun hand
the gun discharges missing tanner
danny drops the gun
tanner snatches it up
tanner immediately has the gun inches from dannys head
danny freezes does that answer your question
beat i fight
i fight and i die like a man
beat youre a fucking coward flynne
you lived like one and now youre gonna die like one
danny looks up at the gun his face a blank
mumbling glock semi automatic mm
tenifer matte finish polymer grip fixed sights and inch barrel ounces double action and a
quick flashes of all the shots danny fired with the glock
two at big bill four at the guys at the table one at garcetti three at tanner and a ten round magazine
still staring at the gun
he knows the gun is empty
he notices something on the floor
kid contd or did i say eleven
danny trying to remember
kid contd which was it mister
was it ten or was it eleven
beat pretty big fucking difference if you ask me
danny starts chuckling
looks up at tanner
it doesnt matter
danny looks down at the syringe again
tanner sees it too
too late to be a hero
danny picks up the syringe
tanner pulls the trigger
inside the gun moving slowly towards the firing pin as it springs forward toward camera with a loud click
ten it is
danny jams the syringe into tanners throat all the way down to the plunger dosing him with the meth
tanner goes down blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe
his eyes roll back as he convulses from the drugs
danny struggles to his feet
tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked out pentecostal in the throws of a holy possession
danny pulls the syringe from tanners throat
a long wet weeze suddenly a noise behind danny
garcetti standing there pointing his gun at danny rocking slightly back and forth a bullet hole in his cheekbone
he looks brain dead
danny doesnt move
tanner still wheezing
garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun but cant
he keeps looking down at his hand trying to get it to obey
danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from garcetti
garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood
he looks down at his hand
he has hacked up the bullet he was shot with
garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at danny
tanners wheezing softly youre dead
garcetti nods slightly
he goes to a kneeling position then curls up on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies
danny goes over to the couch and sits down
danny with his head in his hands emotionally and physically exhausted
close on dannys face
devoid of anything
he stuffs garcettis gun into his own mouth hand shaking
he takes the gun out
stuffs it back in again shoving it way down almost gagging on it
the barrel clatters against his teeth
he takes it out again
the danny starts crying
lifts the gun halfway again then drops it
he jumps up
goes over to the still wheezing tanner and empties his clip into him
when the clip is spent danny keeps pulling the trigger over and over again
he stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and again
danny dressed in his tom clothes
he limps over to the bed and picks up the trumpet case
carries it over to the mirror
danny staring at his reflection
he lights a cigarette
my name is tom van allen
im a trumpet player
nah youre danny flynne
colette and quincey standing there
quincey holds a nine millimeter with a muzzle suppressor
youre a motherfucking rat
he shoots danny in the stomach
danny slumps to the floor
his cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed
you said you wouldnt kill him
she tries to go to danny but quincey stops her
you lied to me
danny looks at them confused a blood stain blossoming on his white shirt
colette what happened

the cops came
but they didnt find nothing
turns out their c
game em some bad information
quincey holds up the baggie of drugs
danny looks from quincey to colette
colette looks away
quincey contd you fuck with the mexicali boys this is what you get homes
under the bed the cigarette smoldering on the carpet
quincey contd domingo thought you might be the one who went rat on him
quincey looks at colette quincey contd so i brought in a rat of my own
danny looks at colette dumbfounded
you set me up
bitch played you like a squeezebox romeo
danny cant help from laughing at the irony
beads of sweat are forming on his blanched face
he looks at colette with a wry smile
youre good princess
ill give you that
danny its not what you think
danny looks down at his bloody stomach
i owed them money
a lot of money
they didnt give me a choice
you know how it works
when i got to know you i tried to back out
thats when they did this
she indicates the bruises but i told them i wouldnt do it
i didnt want to see you get hurt
danny stares at her not sure what to believe
he looks over at quincey
she selling me a bill home boy
quincey shakes his head
nah she aint lying
she took a pretty good beating from you ace
i seen grown men crack after a lot less
but not this bitch
beat it was very touching
then why are we here
they threatened to kill my daughter
beat i had no choice
beat im sorry danny
danny looks at colette imagining the awful beating she must have taken
danny touches her face
beat god damn youre beautiful
under the bed the carpet ignites
the fire spreads quickly
quincey grabs her arm
quincey contd lets go
the drapes go up in flames
quincey puts the gun to the back of her head
you wanna die here with him or come with me
i dont want to leave you
your daughter needs you
the fire continues to spread
colette kisses danny on the lips
quincey pulls her away
collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door cutting off any escape
danny breathing hard
he gets up
staggers over to the mirror where his trumpet is
he opens the case and takes the trumpet out
he plops down on the bed and blows a few notes
he stops for a second a smile on his lips
he starts to play saeta
back to the opening scene
the whole room ablaze
danny lying on the bed playing the horn
so what is it
who am i after its all said and done
pieces of the roof start falling in
danny contd tom van allen or danny flynne
beat avenging angel or plain old judas
he stops playing
danny contd weakly you decide friend
he closes his eyes
danny contd im too tired
so you decide
he drops his trumpet and lays his head back
then blurry vague slow motion moving through the flames
close on dannys head seemingly floating through the fiery room
what is this
emerging from the flames into a dark hallway
dannys eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float
danny contd am i dead
a linoleum floor rushes underneath
danny contd linoleum
this must be hell
danny head sags finds himself staring at
a tattoed likeness of himself
the tattoo smiles and speaks
warped distorted hang in there buddy
stairs rush by underneath
then another hallway
a bright white light at the end of the hall
danny contd oh no
what a fucking cliche
on dannys face floating through the hall
his eyes fluttering
moving towards the light
dannys eyes close his head droops
close on danny as his eyes flutter and open
an image slowly coming into focus
jimmy staring down at him with concern
danny blinks his eyes again
looks up at
a paramedic working on him
danny smiles a weak smile at jimmy
jimmy just sits there nodding his head a big shit eating grin on his face
the paramedic continues to work on danny
his eyes slowly close
danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop
he looks like a new man
well ive had some time to think about it and its pretty simple after all
i guess its like the man said man is the measure of all things
i should know
i ran the gamut
avenging angel judas loving husband prodigal son prince of denmark
i was all of those things
beat tom van allen got his revenge
good for tom
and danny flynne
he got gut shot for being the low life rat that he was
sucks for him
beat but as far as im concerned theyre both dead
danny looks through the window of the shop
colette inside working the counter pouring coffee
danny contd but what about this guy
who is he
danny enters the shop
danny contd to tell you the truth i dont know yet
danny takes a seat at the counter
colette turns and sees him
danny contd but i like his chances
they stare at one another for a beat then smile
colette pours him some coffee
danny contd i really like his chances
they strike up a conversation as we
