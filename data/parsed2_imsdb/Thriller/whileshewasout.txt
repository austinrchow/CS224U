written by susan montford based on a short story by edward bryant th draft december from the pages of a thomas guide converge overlap and re configure across the screen
the endlessly ironic names of american suburbs parade before us their violet territories marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of forest and wilderness
closer in on one last map grid which fades into a transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of the suburb
the name of this housing development is pleasant valley
the transparency fades out to reveal from a sign reading pleasant valley dream homes a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity
each home is brand new
each has the same size lawn the same shrubs the same satellite dish
each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway
all the homes have christmas decorations christmas trees with baubles lights and christmas stars sitting proudly at the top
the doors have christmas wreaths
the sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights
we halt outside one house
this home too seems perfect until we notice the christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn
suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the christmas tree
it rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass
the owl then soars off casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house and disappears with its prey into the woods behind
curtains part at a downstairs window
the silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen
he draws the curtains once again and disappears
we sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen tv and a computer
scene page kenneth a forty something ex jock with a once handsome face pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass
kenneths eyes are glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll endlessly down
he highlights a set of numbers and stands up abruptly from his chair elated
steps back onto a a childs doll crushing it underfoot
his ebullient mood changes quickly
the sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening
della peers into the room
shes a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading southern accent
shes pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans
she sees the broken doll
thats tammis favorite doll
she walks in picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face
he turns back to the computer guiltily takes a sip of beer
you should just swear properly and get it over with
do you think the kids dont know what you mean
close up his face is ruddy the face of someone who drinks too much
he turns back towards her
she ignores him continues to try fix the doll
his eyes linger on her coat
going out again
what is it tonight
auto mechanics for dummies
the bored housewives reading group
he averts his eyes back to the screen then turns back to look at her once more
i got a new one for you
he smiles sardonically
scene page group therapy for women who always have the curse
theres a tuesday night class at the pleasant valley episcopalian
kenneth clearly thinks hes funny
della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth
im going to the mall for wrapping paper
a trail of kids mess in the hallway behind della catches kenneths eye
what do you do all day della honey
cause it sure isnt keeping house
this place is an eyesore
im mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this
his sad eyes meet hers in confrontation
della determined not to engage averts hers
kenneth unable to contain himself faces her
i mean its not like youre at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other mens wives
he lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop looks right in her tired face
the last time i saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party
god della you used to be hot
she bites her lip again but this time to try stop the tears
he turns away in an attempt to conceal his own sadness
she walks away clutching the doll
put the twins to bed by eight
give them a chocolate cookie with their milk
scene page jesus della
della honey im sorry
but shes already left the room
he watches her pick up a set of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway
her knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them
kenneth turns back to his computer
della climbs the stairs
framed photographs on the wall tell the public story of her life
the engagement to kenneth their wedding the birth of the twins kenneths graduation kenneth as a sixth grade football star della on the farm in ohio with her horse a
really young della playing baseball with her father
we linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty something della in a little black dress
terri and tammi are seven year old twins with the delicate blue eyed blonde looks of their mother
della stands in the doorway and watches them
tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons
terris toy dinosaurs are destroying tammis heirloom dolls house starting with the furniture
she steps into the room
mommy can i get an american girl for christmas
i want a raptor dinosaur mommy
you better leave santa a note
its only three days until christmas
she gives them each a kiss breathing in their scent she loves so much
where are you going mommy
scene page the mall
one chocolate cookie each and then daddy will read you a bedtime story
daddys stories are lame
i want you to read us a story
yeah mommy the one about the pirates
no the cowgirls
diamond lil and slingshot kitty
tomorrow night ill read you the best bedtime story in the whole world
della gives them a little wave and turns to leave
ill check in on you both when i get back
beat to make sure youre sleeping
terris already turned back to his dinosaurs
tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing shes been working on
its a drawing of a stick figure family holding hands
the words mommy we love you are written across a cloudy night sky like big stars
thank you tammi its wonderful
della doesnt have time to look at it properly so she folds the drawing up and puts it in her pocket
she kisses tammi again and turns to leave
tammis eyes follow her mother as she walks away
della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs
she sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots
the boots are well worn but polished to a gleam
scene page behind her an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p
the sound of gun shots fades in from the tv in kenneths office
della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet
she looks at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks away
della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and opens the front door
the tv blares out some action flick from kenneths ajar door
della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie silence of the suburbs
she closes the door softly behind her and rushes along the path to the driveway where the familys black ford explorer is parked
she chirps the remote and quickly climbs in
della inserts the key and turns it in the lock
the car sputters in defiance against the cold night
the car sputters again
with a massive exertion the car engine turns over and the vehicle starts
she sighs with relief
she turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent pauses to look at her home through the car window
for a second in an upstairs window she sees a reflection of tammi
she smiles then looks at the house and lawn and the christmas tree
she notices the fallen star is about to get out of the car to retrieve it but decides its too cold
scene page a shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into reverse and backs up
we follow her as she backs up pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard
the road is empty
all the cars are neatly tucked away in their driveways and it looks like no ones out tonight
she makes a right turn onto
she follows the road as it curves around a long row of endlessly monotonous houses
in the distance we can see the gates of pleasant valley gated community
she slows down rolls down her window and swipes a chub card against the security panel
the gates slowly open
she drives through
the gates close behind her
she rolls the window up and makes a left turn onto
the road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls of gated communities
a ford explorer just like hers passes in the opposite direction
della smiles mysteriously reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand
she pushes aside a bunch of car papers a flare pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath her secret hiding place for a nice pack of marlboros
she smiles again the smile of the secret smoker
she presses the cigarette lighter into the dashboard
the lighter pops out
she tips out a cigarette sees a sticky note attached to the interior foil
scrawled in messy handwriting are the words you are supposed to be quitting ill get right on that kenneth honey
after you stop drinking
scene page she rips the note off stuffs it in her purse lights the cigarette
she inhales deeply
we see the pleasure written across her face
a few cars pass della in the night
their lights are like torches in the suburban wilderness
there is the familiar ring of a cellular phone
della has programmed one of those oh so cute recognizable tunes into it like the william tell overture
della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her purse with the other
she eventually locates the phone
della its mary messina
della rolls her eyes
this is not a welcome call
you okay sweetie
how are you
howd you get my cell number
della balances the phone while she drags on her cigarette
i called kenneth at the house
she exhales sharply
scene page and howd that go
did he give you an earful for disturbing his ninety ninth viewing of lethal weapon four
kenneth is always charming
at least to me
the car flashes past the decorated sign for a local school
before della can stop herself the words are out
well with the way you flaunt your double d boob job at the free fun pta events thats hardly a surprise
fortunately for her the phone happens to make a deep metallic distortion at that moment
what was that
oh nothing mary
you got lucky with that one
patricia ellis says hes the best looking guy in pleasant valley
well that wouldnt be hard
mary do you need something
cause i gotta go
yes are you going to tool school tomorrow
mary giggles at her own joke
this is why she is having her serenity interrupted
scene page tool school
do it yourself mechanics is without a doubt the most interesting thing in my life right now
smiles i carry my beloved toolbox in the trunk at all times
the desolate road disappears behind della
she passes a roadside memorial
im just joking della
you know me
i pre paid ten classes and only made it to two
if you are going i could use a ride
id hate to miss another class
if della was going before shes not now
sorry mary im skipping this week
kenneths parents are coming to stay for christmas
you know how it is
a red light looms ahead
oh thats too bad
maybe patricia ellis will be going
you check with her mary
god bless you and your family
christmas lights outline a few distant houses
under her breath bah humbug
scene page della stops at the red light
she clicks off the phone and lets it lay on her lap
she rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat casts aside an anorak mittens a sock
she finds what shes looking for a bottle of water caught on the bar under the passenger seat
its only a third full but she takes a sip recoils from its coldness
the light changes
she throws the bottle into the back seat
christmas lights reindeer stars even the american flag dot the black night
della picks up the phone and pushes a few keys
she has not dialed enough to make a full phone call when we hear the phone ring on the other side
how may i direct your call
the learning academy
please hold for that number
della slows down for another red light
shes at a wide crossroads where the housing development abruptly ends and a wasteland of deforestation begins
a billboard for another new housing development announces green street dream homes investment opportunities
waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof
della tries not to look at it
a recording breaks into the moment just as the light ahead changes to green
scene page recording press your pound key now to connect with your request
della presses the pound key and drives straight ahead
learning academy this is meghan
its della myers
you calling about spanish for beginners
you know that tom cancelled cause of new years
yes i knew
can you hold i have another call
frustrated della turns on the radio
it is some innocuous local ad
pleasant valley dream homes
the lowest crime rate in the us
call della switches stations trying to find something she likes
she gives up and waits for meghan to return
the car flashes past construction road signs
can you leave word for mike
im going to miss tomorrows mechanics class
its just the one time
everyone misses that class at least once
scene page i guess some people find it boring
well see you the first week in january then
yes you will
unless i run off and become an outlaw or something
we hear the familiar beep of another call coming in
i have to go
merry christmas you too
della clicks the phone over to the incoming call
cassies voice is almost lost in the din of her surroundings
where are you
grand central station
hold on ill take the phone outside
a loud noise appears out of nowhere
the car screeches to a halt
della almost didnt see it
she is at a railroad crossing the third car in line and she almost rear ended the car in front of her
scene page just a minute della
i almost rear ended a car
the phone cuts out
the train starts to go laboriously past
carriage after carriage of brand name building materials for new housing developments
della lights another cigarette
she turns on the radio again finds a station playing the sound of silence
the crossing gates go up
the cars ahead of her start
della shifts into drive
the phone rings its special tune again
della turns the volume of the radio down
whats up cassie
im over at southeast plaza
what was it we need to get for pilates
one of those rubber balls i think
im headed over there now
ran out of christmas wrapping paper
would you believe it
its hell here tonight
everyone and their uncle is at the mall
dellas phone makes a loud distorted noise
my cell batterys dying
she rifles about in the passenger seat leans over to the back and rifles about there among the kids toys gives up
damn i must have left the charger in the other car
scene page you want me to pick up something for you while im here
cassies kind offer almost reduces della to tears
i mean im
the phone beeps again
your phones breaking up della
im not joking when i say its packed over here
it cant be that bad
the light up ahead turns amber then red
why dont we meet somewhere for a drink
sure but a lattes about the best they can do in this mall
a lattes fine
lets meet at the fountain opposite victorias secret
the light changes and della drives up and over a hill
the phone beeps again
my batterys going
im a block away
see you in five minutes
okay but i wont be able to wait very
the phone beeps again
scene page della lets it drop onto her lap
she opens the window and flicks out the remains of her cigarette
she waves her hands to fan away the smoke
she closes the window again
shes about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her mind and stuffs them directly into her purse
as the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to stare ahead
the day before christmas eve
hell on earth
a large sprawling parking lot full of cars
nothing but cars
a sea of cars
for a second della contemplates turning around and leaving
the guy in the suv behind her beeps
she steps on the gas
her car careens slowly down hill to the lot
the road spits her out in front of the mall entrance where revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting
della follows several cars down the first long row of parked cars
the asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall
puddles gather in its dents and hollows
she passes car after densely parked car
there isnt a space in sight
she reaches the end of the row and indicates left turns down the next row ploughs through a rain puddle which splashes up onto a mother whos walking her little
girl and boy back to their car
the woman shouts at della
watch where youre going
della rolls down her window
scene page sorry
the mothers weighed down with shopping bags
she glares at della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her
della sighs drives down the second aisle
an escape midway down the row blocks traffic
its waiting for a subaru to pull out so it can take the spot
lucky son of a
the subaru exits the spot slowly
della taps her impatient fingers against the steering wheel
the subaru pulls away and the escape snaps into the empty space
della continues her journey down to the end of the row
there are no spaces
it dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just isnt going to happen
she takes the last puff from the cigarette burning out in the ashtray
using the side aisle she scoots past row three and four as they all flow one way
at the end of this row a confrontation is brewing
several cars block each other
an angry driver screams at another
if you think youre gonna steal my spot think again asshole
della looks on for a moment at the confrontation
she grinds out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray slams it closed
scene page della shakes her head and turns left into row five
are there really this many cars in pleasant valley
its a brand new mall and the only one around for miles but this is ridiculous
della reaches the end of row five quickly
she guessed there wouldnt be a spot so shes driving faster
she notices a portly middle aged rent a cop directing traffic ahead
she lowers her window
the rent a cop stops directing and approaches the car
can i help you
do you know where i can definitely find parking
theres nothing close by
even the valets backed up
you might want to try further out
he points off into the distance through the sea of cars
but be willing to walk
a car waiting behind della honks its horn loudly and the rent a cop saunters away
della guns the ford down row eight
at the end of this row della decides to take the rent a cops advice
she makes another left at the aisle and skips several more rows
she heads down to the third from last row
if she never sees another car it will be too soon
della spies a spot halfway down the row
scene page she guns the engine gets ready to pull in and is denied
somebody has parked an enormous old gold plymouth so badly its taking up two spaces
she brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply
shes starting to lose her patience now
with no options left della heads down to the very last row
more cars fill the spaces
and then two spots
the last two spots in the car park
they overlook undeveloped land just beyond the mall
small concrete bumps signify the end of each space
della whips the car into the first one
she sighs with relief as she straightens the car up into the spot
she sits for a second trying to calm herself down but it isnt working
she reaches for another cigarette then talks herself out of it
she fastens her coat grabs her purse and opens the door
steps down from the ford right into a puddle
the dirty water splashes up onto her pants
she shakes the boot off and looks over at the mall
its at least a half mile away glimmering in the distance
she sets off marching across the lot taking what seems to be the most direct route
maybe she can shake off this mood by the time she gets inside
she passes the plymouth turns stares back at it
the car is dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof thats almost peeled away
she walks up close tries to decipher the plate but its caked with mud
annoyance rises like bile in her throat
scene page she finds herself reaching into her purse rummaging for a small notebook then a sharpie
she leans on the car as she writes
she scans her words
della rips the piece of paper from the notebook folds the note several times and slides it under the plymouths windshield wipers
the driver cant miss it
that felt good
head held high she marches on towards the mall
the camera pulls up so we can see the mall see della marching across the lot see the crowds of shoppers entering and exiting the mall and get the feeling
that maybe somebody just saw her
shoppers are buying freshly felled christmas trees from a vendor
della squeezes past and pushes through the mall doors
a wave of heat and christmas lights hits della
a wave of nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last minute shoppers
distorted muzak versions of christmas songs seep from invisible speakers
della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see santa in his grotto
she squeezes through and makes her way towards the fountain outside of victorias secret
en route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest
its a classic revival of chanel no
we have a wonderful christmas special on offer at macys
she hands della a sample and flyer
scene page thanks
della arrives at the fountain
a piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes
she scans the crowd but theres no sign of cassie
della sits at the edge of the fountain
she checks her watch then checks out the people milling around in front of victorias secret where mannequins in skimpy festive underwear are propped seductively in the window displays
still no sign of cassie
shes about to make a wish and throw a quarter into the fountain when a red cross worker shakes her save the children tin at her
della sticks the quarter into the tin instead
della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women examine slim fit underpants and padded bras
she notices a pure silk black teddy very classic no frills
she lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in front of the mirror tries to imagine herself in it
a young sales assistant approaches
its pure silk the last one in our classic black label collection
would you like me to fix you a changing room
della checks the size tag
it reads c two sizes too big
and the price tag next to it
its expensive for victorias secret
not my size
she gestures to her small boobs smiles and hands the teddy to the sales assistant
she quickly leaves the shop
della checks one last time at the fountain for cassie
she tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a generic coffee shop
maybe cassie will be there
scene page harried women and a few men clutching bags full of gifts and impatient children stand on line for their favorite drug
della squeezes past them to look for cassie
every seat at every booth is full but theres no sign of her friend
della joins the line
she finds herself biting at her nails a bad habit since childhood
a woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the pick up area
della moves up to the counter to where an overweight sales assistant waits on her
a latte please
she notices some chocolate covered biscotti on the counter
and a chocolate biscotti
she catches sight of herself in the mirror behind the counter
kenneths right about one thing she looks awful
bitter or milk chocolate
seeing herself in the mirror changes her mind about the biscotti
forget it just the coffee
della two ls
four dollars and seventy nine cents
della pushes the money towards her and waits for her coffee
when it finally shows up her name is spelled dela
she sighs and checks the line for cassie as she leaves the shop
scene page she passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy windows
inside women are getting their hair styled and their nails manicured at the same time
della looks down at her bitten nails but just cant bring herself to go inside
della is that you
she turns around to see lynn monroe a pretty well groomed redhead about her age
i knew it was you della
i havent seen you since college
you left to marry some handsome jock and we never heard from you again
something like that
do you live around here now
david and i just bought this divine house in pleasant valley
do you know it
great for the kids
della nods but lynn keeps speaking
della sips on her latte
its the first time ive left the doors unlocked since i was a child growing up in the midwest
davids been promoted to vp of united motors so its all happening for us
but enough of me
how are you
oh we have two kids
twins tammi and terri
lynn becomes distracted focusing on her perfect reflection in the steamy glass
scene page why thats fantastic
listen della its been great talking to you but i have to go get my hair done
david and i are going out tomorrow night for a romantic dinner
i just bought this gorgeous teddy from victorias secret
she opens the bag and della sees its the black teddy she eyed earlier
hope we bump into each other again soon sweetie
merry christmas she gives della a fake kiss and rushes into the salon
della chucks her half finished coffee into a nearby trash can and walks on through the mall
della enters a pharmacy
she locates the wrapping paper aisle
she sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety nine cents
she feels the texture of the paper its thin and looks gaudy so she puts them all back
instead she selects some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and matching silver ribbon
she then finds some jolly childrens wrapping with christmas tree designs and a great big red bow
she browses through the aisles of cards
she sees some cute cards for the twins and then arrives at the to my darling husband at christmas section
she opens some of the cards and recoils from the sentiments contained inside
she catches a groomed blonde housewife staring at her and corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a complicit stepford smile
its a pity they dont have any to a bastard at christmas cards
the woman looks at della like shes a lunatic
della chuckles to herself
she finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of regular tampax
she gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a tired man and his two kids wait before her on the line
scene page the man tries to remove a snow globe with a tiny house and christmas tree inside from the clutches of his young son
the child starts bawling
the man ends up buying the snow globe to placate the child
its dellas turn
the pharmacy sales assistant smiles
god planned it for christmas day just to tick me off
thirty dollars and sixty nine cents she packs dellas stuff into paper bags
della hands her visa card over
its a lot less crowded now
the melancholy home for christmas plays
she follows the ladies sign to the entrance to the bathroom only to find an out of order sign on the door
she sees a cleaning lady in the corridor
how come the ladies bathroom is out of order on a night like this
the one at the other side of the mall is open maam
the cleaning lady disappears through the bathroom door with her cart of cleaning utensils
della looks down the length of the huge mall and decides shes not even going to try to find the other bathroom
she can wait until she gets home
she makes her way towards the exit pulls her coat in tight and braces herself for the cold front outside
scene page a group of carol singers sing silent night
all is calm
all is bright
della listens for a moment
their voices are clear and bright
behind them she can see the christmas tree vendor bag up the left over trees
dellas hands start to pinch with the cold
she gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across the emptying lot
the last of the shoppers rush across the car park to find their cars
its pretty dark between the dim pole lamps and the car lights
she slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass then another
a man and his little girl walk past
dellas eyes linger on the little girl
she really wants to get home to the kids
the singers voices echo faintly through the night
holy infant so tender and mild
she walks faster almost at a dash
where is her car
even further out than she remembered thats for sure
a car alarm goes off in the distance
the alarm stops at last as della approaches the outer section of the parking lot
shepherds quake at the sight
glories beam from heaven afar
she cuts between some of the cars in row eight
zigzags across aisle nine
notices the plymouth still parked ahead
she stops for a split second
glances at the windshield
the note is gone
scene page maybe it fell off
she checks the ground around the car
no sign of it
she shrugs who cares anyway
she cuts across the next aisle
its almost empty
and the one after that
her explorer is sandwiched between two cars in this otherwise empty row
holy night she chirps the remote twice and pops the trunk places the bags inside
she slams the trunk closed and hurries to the drivers side climbs in pulling the door closed behind her
della turns the key in the ignition and presses in the lighter
she lights a cigarette and inhales as she lets the car warm up for seconds
she rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the hand brake and slips the gear into reverse
the interior of her car is suddenly flooded with light from another cars headlights
she glances in the rear view mirror
a car is blocking her
she steps on the brake and waits for the car to move
but it doesnt
its headlights flick to full beam blinding her view in her car mirrors
she honks her horn
the car still doesnt move
dellas really angry now
she slips the gearshift into park and steps out of her car
della squints in the blinding headlights
the front of the car looks familiar
its the gold plymouth
two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again
the lights abruptly go out
della blinks her eyes try to adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few car lengths away
she uneasily turns back to her car
scene page i got a gun
its a young male voice
the statement stops della dead in her tracks
hows about i aim it at your pussy first
the words are emphasized by another boys shrill giggling
this cant be happening
her eyes are adjusting
the glare phantoms drift out to the limit of her peripheral vision and vanish
she sees three boys in front of her then a fourth but she doesnt see any gun
what the hell are you playing at
trust the nigga we not playin
huey is a sweet faced african american decked out in a hip hop style
hes small and skinny and cant be more than eighteen
hes playing to chuckie whos twenty one and looks like a marine gone awol
bracketing them is vinh a nineteen year old asian punk and tomas twenty a latino runaway in an american idol t shirt
dellas eyes drift across the group
she suppresses a hysterical giggle but cant resist smarting off
what are you
the worlds first homeless united nations boy band
we just wanna do shows and bone hoes
huey messes with his zipper
we got a song fo yo
its called shut up bitch and eat a dick
huey and tomas snigger
vinh stares at the asphalt
scene page and when yo done eating we gonna staple that bitch mouth closed
chuckie nudges huey and tomas steps towards della

the boys fall silent
vinh lights a cigarette

games not worth the dime
at least your parents have a sense of humor
i aint got no parents
i named myself
to huey grab my parka from the back seat
he pinches hueys cheeks
and smile playa
the dopes game and the games dope
chuckie leads huey a few steps to the plymouth
huey ducks into the back seat
chuckie keeps his eyes fixed on della
you got a beef with us mrs
della looks defiantly back without answering
chuckie runs his fingers along the hood of the rusty gold plymouth
first you put yo hands on my ride
now i dont know how you was raised but in my world laying your hands on someone elses shit is crossing their line
then you go slipping an incendiary note up under my windscreen wipers
scene page well thatd uckie contd ch be an invitation to war to me and my ghetto soldiers
if you hadnt parked like an asshole we wouldnt be arguing about it right now
vinh inhales sharply from his cigarette
keep right on talking that gang a shit chinga
yo crimes against the click are digging yo grave deep
dellas eyes quickly scan the group for sign of the gun
she cant see one so she gambles theyre just mouthing off and makes her move
go to hell
della turns towards her car
huey steps out of the shadows wearing chuckies parka hood up covering his face startles della
we already in hell
della sidesteps him reaches the back of her car
any trouble here maam
everyone turns to see a rent a cop puffed up like a pigeon in his fur trimmed jacket and russian style cap
its the same guy della approached earlier when she was looking for spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across the unsnapped holster flap at his hip
not if these delinquents move their barge so i can back up
how about it boys
chuckie smiles and nudges tomas who starts dancing in a real mocking manner imitating the rent a cop
scene page chuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and points it straight at the rent a cops face
we not in the mood
chuckie looks at his friends for approval
huey laughs again shrill
vinh hunches and looks around
the rent a cop backs away
for jesus sake
tomas takes off a small crucifix from around his neck and dangles it in front of the rent a cop
say yo prayers old man
chuckie grins at della while keeping the gun pointed straight at the rent a cop
these rent a pig companies are too lame to give their foot soldiers any ammo
liability laws and all that
the rent a cop goes for his pistol anyway
chuckie shoots him in the face
we thought della was in trouble but now we know she is
the bullet hits the rent a cop in the forehead
blood spurts from the exit wound
he slumps to the asphalt like a marionette whose strings have just been cut
bullet smoke hangs in the air where he once stood
smoke too blackens the bullets entry wound
blood puddles out from the back of his head
its clear that chuckies been acting harder than he is
the hand that holds the gun is trembling
the color drains from his face
all stand riveted in shock
scene page a deathly silence follows
the carol singers can be heard in the distance faintly finishing up silent night
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace
chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is forthcoming
the rent a cops body twitches
chuckie hesitates then raises the gun
he aims and fires
the shot shatters the top of the rent a cops head
chuckie flinches closes his own eyes in reflex
if she started screaming now she may never stop
she spins instead and makes for her car door
shes dead if she doesnt get out of here and she knows it
shes busting a move
chuckie opens his eyes
vinh points to della
chuckie looks over and sees della disappear through the door of her explorer
agitation overwhelms him
she aint going nowhere
we got her ford blocked in right
he looks at vinh who nods then at huey
i dont know nothing
chuckie looks back at vinh then over at tomas
muttering dar candela por el culo
i can just put one through her windshield right
no one answers
chuckie turns once more to the rent a cop whose body still twitches in some final death throe
will you just die
scene page he raises the gun
another shot explodes into the night
della flinches but no bullet tears through the back of her skull
she slams into the drivers seat and punches the door lock switch
she hits the four wheel drive button and presses the accelerator pedal to the metal
the explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier
the barrier screeches along the underside of the frame
there is a loud scraaaaape noise as the car heaves over the barrier
then the rear wheels bounce and claw over
the car fishtails momentarily
she releases the pressure on the accelerator
the explorer straightens
tomas screams at chuckie
chinga tu madre
she making her getaway
all except chuckie turn to look as della accelerates across the unfinished outskirts of the car park behind them
vinh tugs at chuckies sleeve
but chuckies staring at the bloody mess he made with a faraway look in his eyes like hes disassociating
vinh throws down the stub of his cigarette follows tomas into the plymouth
tomas guns the engine
she on her cell right now calling the pigs
hueys almost hysterical
scene page we going down for this
chuckie turns on him
you gone buck wild nigga
we aint going down for shit
you aint earned the right to call me a nigga
and that goes for all you haters
behind him dellas car turns onto the malls outer perimeter service road in the distance
easy my g
chuckie cajoles huey
the world is our bitch right
huey calms down
chuckie gently pushes him into the plymouth back seat beside vinh
get in my fallen soldier
chuckie opens the driver door
shove over tomas
you know i front the ride
tomas shuffles over to the passenger seat
chuckie climbs into driver side
the plymouth screeches across the parking lot and exits onto the service road
della speeds down the long dark empty service road which skims the deserted warehouses at the back of the mall
between the warehouses are dark patches of undeveloped land no mans land
not a car nor a person in sight
scene page it starts to rain
she shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery
types in anyway
she shakes it some more
she relentlessly checks the rearview and side mirrors as she races into the rainy night
the driving conditions are not good poor visibility ahead
she speeds anyway
the road has to connect to a main road soon
another glance in the rearview
once more in the rearview
its the plymouth
she presses the accelerator down harder
the engine revs
in the rearview theres a sudden flash above her rear left headlight
theyre shooting at her
della steps the accelerator to the floor praying the explorer wont skid out
the engine struggles catches up
the sudden speed causes a small silver love heart hanging on a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror to crash against the window
the catch bursts open to reveal two tiny photos of the twins inside
the necklace flies back and forth against the window as the explorer races onwards
the plymouth accelerates behind blasting rap
its thick tires plow along the wet asphalt gripping to the road below in steady pursuit
its windows are all steamed up
the front passenger window is open a hand and a gun muzzle stick through
scene page another flash and dellas left side mirror shatters
she swerves in panic
her car almost hits the ditch
this cant be happening
not to her
she reclaims the steering wheel
hits the accelerator again
the plymouth swerves behind on the skid that della created corrects itself just before the ditch
della gains speed
the plymouth lags
a stop sign appears ahead
the roads ending
right or left della
make a choice
there is no choice
a barrier blocks the left hand turn
a big sign reads lot full
della swings right instead
the streetlights recede behind her
nothing but the darkness of a housing complex under construction ahead
but she seems to have shaken off her pursuers
she speeds down the road looking intently for any sign of life
but theres nothing but half built houses empty houses houses just like hers
a seven eleven sign appears
she slows down
but it may as well be a mirage its an unfinished building with only the sign in an unfinished mini mall
scene page close to screaming now she speeds up
more empty houses in varying stages of construction
no sign of life
then what looks like a filling station one light on in the kiosk
she pulls in and dims her lights drives right up to the kiosk door
its in its final stages of installation but definitely not functioning
and theres no one there
back onto the road and she sees far behind her car headlights that can only belong to the plymouth following her through the darkness
she dims her lights to just the side lights
hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher
potholes filled with mud and rain water splash against the car
her wipers struggle to cope
she can hardly see through the front window
the potholes yawn deeper
the asphalt ends
gravel deteriorates to dirt
she steers the ford blindly
scene page a wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly ahead
she guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car plows into the barrier
theres a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays around her
the explorer slams through and veers towards a clump of trees
della tries to sit upright but the autos spinning too fast
the car swings then crashes right into a pine tree
the car stalls out
a prolonged moment
then della crawls out from under the dashboard sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair
she reaches up and hits the light switch
pine branches protrude through the broken windshield
using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the drivers seat and sits down
she slides the gear into park turns the key
the engine groans like a dying animal then gives up
she takes a deep breath
she tries again
the engine groans again another death rattle
it just wont catch
she switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open
she steps out of the car
scene page she closes the door behind her sos not to trigger the light switch
finds her legs are giddy
holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself
it looks like shes crashed at the very end of the housing development where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest
the dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier into the midst of the forest
behind her shrouded in darkness houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape
land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land waiting to tear into the next layer of forest
patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky
shes driven all the way from the mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail
this must be some sick joke
speaking of which where are these little bastards
her eyes scan the darkness for a sign
that doesnt mean theyre not close by
she checks out the damage to the car by feel
the drivers side is scratched and dented
the front is wedged into the tree
the only way out is for her to back up the car
she climbs back in for another try
della turns the key
it barely even groans this time
just a faint gurgle
she rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare sticks it in her pocket
she leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk
della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in the trunk
scene page she throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as she searches
pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box
she hears the screech of a cars wheels spinning in mud
della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road behind pointing upwards
the plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud
she closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the car clutching the toolbox and the wrench
she reaches back into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash
she softly closes the door again
punches her way through the branches
slides her fingers under the hood pries up the lever
it pops up only a few inches
she tries to manually lift it
but its heavy with the weight of pine branches
voices drift towards her
keep hitting on the gas and you gonna dig them wheels into a dirt grave
save yo talk and get out and push
the sound of car doors opening feet squishing into the mud and cussing
the boys materialize in the light from the headlights
scene page whats aggravating you now
our new sneakers are stuck up in the dirt like they was last years
doors slam and two sets of footsteps join the others
soon as we taken care o mrs
podunk you and the spanish dancer can hit the next mall
but first you fakers best haul this rider out of the filth
stupid ass car got nowhere else to go
theres nothing but trees up ahead
screw the car chuckie
case you forgot we got a witness on the loose
i aint want to end up in the clink as some chimps prison pillow
trust me dog hoes going down execution style before we see the other side o them bars
della drops the hood
it makes a faint squeak but doesnt slam down seems its stuck open these last few inches
yo talk a real mob threat chuckie
but what if she gone already
chuckies eyes scan the housing estate
she aint gone
della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the hood
but some larger branches are jammed wedged by the broken tree
when she looks back over for the boys she sees the car headlights are off and theres no sign of them
scene page she stands stock still listening scanning the landscape for a sign of them
the sound of glass shattering breaks the silence
della jumps out of her skin spins around
her eyes settle on a light in the distance
the light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving truck
the cabin glows like a box in the darkness
theres a figure inside its chuckie
hes inspecting a powerful construction flashlight
he switches settings from broad light to concentrated beam
he points the beam through the broken glass window onto tomas whos standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow
chuckie leaps down through the broken window pleased with his find
he switches it to broad beam whistles
wont be long before we find her now
this baby could spot a needle in a haystack
the light dances around illuminating each of their faces for seconds at a time
eerie distorted glimpses
theyre traipsing along the rough road through the mud towards della
their voices grow louder
we caught up in this bitchs life like a soap opera
we could just bail blast out of town like we was never here
this boy loves weed so much he tried to marry juana
aint no one cares about the rent a pig
he just collateral damage to the peeps at the mall
chuckie pushes huey half playfully half annoyed
listen up skippy she the only scene page but if we hit the road now well be five hundred miles away before they find him
we could be drinking cold beer and swimmin in the atlantic
just like you promised
huey stares off into space like hes having a vision
we gotta take care of her
when she gone
the problem gone
well head off then huey just like i said
huey shakes his head in disbelief
we aint gonna make it are we chuckie
i aint never gonna see it
its over for that isnt it chuckie
just say it
chuckie is taken aback by what huey is saying
he walks away turns his concentration back to the flashlight
huey calls after him
she was just some stupid housewife mouthin off
get real huey
and shut the fuck up about the stupid ocean
chuckie gets right up in hueys face
i ever break a promise to you
i ever let you down
huey takes his time to answer
no chuckie you aint
chuckie puts his hand on hueys shoulder and gently pushes him along the road
della tries once more to lift the hood
it still wont budge
scene page when she looks up the flashlight is dancing towards her
vinh sees the car
theres her ford
della grabs the lug wrench and toolbox and ducks behind the trees
della sees them approach her car
theres broken glass everywhere
huey now resigned to their mission comments sadly
someone call her mama tell her to lay out her black dress
della creeps softly along the edge of the trees
she holds her breath
if she makes a sound shes dead
is she dead already
the boys kick around the explorer
musta gone been thrown through the windshield
della skims the trees constantly checking behind her to where her antagonists check out the ford wreck
chuckie points to some footprints
she aint dead
her footprints are all around
when theres enough distance between them and her she darts from the forests edge into the development and hides behind a half finished house
she leans against a recently bricked wall finally takes a breath
the smell of fresh cement and putty fills her nostrils
scene page rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge she peers around the side of the house
beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs she sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her ford illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their
her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall
when she looks back over for the boys she sees that the flashlight and the boys are gone
she strains her eyes
guesses that must mean theyre off looking for her in another direction
she clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the houses
if she could just track along the edge of the development she could maybe make it back to the shopping mall to the twins
an owl hoots from the trees behind
she freezes eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger
she waits a moment silence then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees
shes trying desperately not to make a sound praying to be invisible eyes darting around evaluating every shape and form
on one side the dense wood of trees predominantly pine with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches
on the other plots and structures of homes to be
she keeps trudging on skirting the edge of the trees following the lights in the distance
she hears a loud thudding noise
ahead piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view
she braces herself peers cautiously around sees nothing
she clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards
scene page rain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp causing the sound
she breathes a sigh of relief
heaps of damp shingle and cement cause her to back up and around past them and a cement mixer
she loses sight of the neon mall lights
she runs between the foundations of two houses
she stops suddenly when she sees a giant shadow looming across her path
she ducks down the side of a half finished house
sees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck
she keeps going between the houses looking for a sign of the mall lights
just ahead a flurry of footprints
theyre her footprints
she finds herself back where she started at the same house
the mall lights flicker in the distance as far away as they always were
the fords still there ahead
and then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her
under her breath she bites back a sob
della shrinks backwards between the houses
she ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead
scene page she runs into the house and out through the far side
skirts a row of plots of land
then she hears chuckies mocking voice echoing through the building site
did she just hallucinate
how the hell do they know her name
can they see her
or is he just shouting her name randomly into the night
her eyes dart right then left then back again
she runs down a row of house foundations
della dives into an unfinished house hides behind a space where a window will eventually be looks out across the building site
all is dark outside
and then she sees the light several rows down weaving between the houses
she makes for another window at the opposite end of the house
she sees the mall lights and decides to head once more towards them
she creeps out of the house and crosses several rows of houses then several more heading towards the neon lights in the distance
she stops dead in her tracks
straight ahead a truly chilling sight her kids stuff from the car terris little anorak tammis socks mittens strung along a short stretch of wire fence
her feet start to sink into wet mud
she covers her mouth to stop herself crying out
suddenly the development is illuminated by a huge construction light
scene page della ducks down tries to run
the mud cloys at her feet
she steps up onto a plank that stretches between the first floors of two houses
she starts to cross when she sees their silhouettes
theyre searching the house next door
whered little red riding hood git to
she aint leaving any bread crumbs thats for sure
when a nigga hungry imma wolf
she backs up slips slides off the plank falls into the mud catches herself on some barbed wire
what was that
the wire drives through her coat and into her right shoulder
she jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows
she bites her lip to prevent a pained response
shes caught in its spiral like a trapped animal
she spins around and physically pulls the wire from her back tearing her coat
she casts the wire away from her
she crawls into the foundations of a nearby house underneath the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first floor
she huddles in a dark corner
its very quiet and cramped
she tries not to move not to breathe
the smell of the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous
a moment passes
it feels like an infinity
scene page she starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see if she can see anything above
just as she approaches the gap she hears
the sound of footsteps above her
the footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks
she silently undoes the catch of the toolbox
her hands are shaking
she lifts the lid
she rakes around inside for tools comes across several kids toys instead
in shock she rakes around some more trying to find something else something more dangerous anything
to her surprise the only tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small crescent wrench
the kids must have borrowed the other tools replacing them with the toys
she gives up closes over the lid
then suddenly the whole house is illuminated
she looks up to see four faces looking down at her
chuckie points the gaze of a powerful flashlight directly into her eyes
the beam almost blinds her
she tries to look away but chuckie focuses it right in her eyes
peek a boo
she shrinks back towards the wall
her mouth feels dry so dry
tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so they can see her
chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it voyeuristically down across her body
the light lingers on her breasts
huey whistles appreciatively picks the game back up from the parking lot
yo left without yo goodbye kiss
the light sweeps past hueys hips
the sound of a zipper
the light sweeps back up onto della
scene page you a window shopper little brother
you aint never even done the old in and out before
waves of pain spasm through dellas shoulder
the boys snigger
imma just a young playa tryin to put my bid in
tomas leans down towards della
chuckie moves the flashlight to illuminate them both
tomas drains the last dregs from a bottle of bud tosses the empty bottle down into the foundations
it rolls into the darkness
she clutches the lug wrench against her coat behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall
dont worry when we done wit you we send yo back in yo trunk to mr
tomas reaches down and pulls della up to standing by the coat collar
he then yanks the coat down over her shoulder
the white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making the form of her breasts very clear
chuckie keeps the light focused right on her
tomas slides his index finger down across dellas neck towards her breasts
della claws at tomas face with the nails of her free hand
he staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing
her chewed nails havent left any dents but she stunned him
the others laugh
she shrugs the coat back over her shoulders and pulls it tight across herself once again clasping the toolbox close to her side
dont want to play nice
he moves towards her face twisted with hate arm raised
scene page back off five minutes my ghetto brother
tomas glares at della then lowers his arm
spits on the ground instead
turns back to the boys
chuckie moves forwards and focuses on dellas box
whats with the man size crast
della doesnt answer
you running with the family jewels
della still doesnt answer
you rob a bank this morning della
della remains determinedly mute
least yo learned something tonight della honey
yeah like how to quit mouthing if you wanna avoid drama
you must be wondering how we come to know your name
you screwed up della myers
left your purse in the ford
chuckie holds up her driving licence and examines it
what a shitty photo
chuckie nods to vinh
vinh passes his lighter to chuckie
chuckie lights the licence on fire
the plastic burns black and toxic
the flame annihilates dellas name her date of birth her face
pieces of plastic unfurl and drift up through the empty windows and doors of the unfinished house
scene page guess you wont be needing it no more
della stares defiantly fighting back the internal nausea caused by this symbolically brutal act
chuckie maneuvers the light back in her eyes then right back on his own menacing face
then back again on her face
she becomes disoriented
so whats in the box
della remains mute looks away from the beam
yo think she carrying the big notes maybe some ice
nah it aint about to rain diamonds huey
but maybe she cashed in her life savings
planned to take off start a new life
della tries to swallow but her throat is too dry
that right della
you got enough scratch in there to grease us up with
she knows there is nothing that would buy them off and the knowledge sinks like a stone deep into her gut
chuckie follows her face with the beam
she tries to dodge its glare in her eyes
but he maneuvers it like a surveillance camera
his voice takes on a meanness that makes the back of her neck tingle
they crowd closer toward her
dark forms with eyes glinting
their voices echoing
scene page open the box else we put you in trauma
della all but screams
ill open it
dellas brain races
her hands move slowly
she rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch
she holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand from the beam as she slips it inside the box
a prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench
she curls them around its handle and grips tight
a surge of nervous energy courses through her veins
she aint got nuthin
lets just take that pussy and git going
he moves towards her
in a flash she withdraws the crescent wrench
she cocks her wrist back and hurls the tool snaps it just like her daddy taught her to play baseball
the wrench flies up and across the house
with a crunch it catches chuckie right in the collar bone right side
drops the flashlight
drops to his knees holding his throat
della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it
she throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between tomas and huey
scene page huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank lands with his face down biting on the planks edge
della catches a peripheral glimpse of tomas leaping towards her but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of hueys neck
grinds hueys face into the plank with a hideous thud
hueys neck snaps back smiley style
hueys scream gurgles into the night
hueys body falls through the space in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations below
tomas falls away cursing in horror
della makes a run for the doorway
she jumps down onto the muddy lot and heads off across the development
the darkness quickly swallows her
behind her vinh slumps through the house
what the fuck niggaz
chuckie slides down to be beside huey in the foundations
and dont be using the n word
you aint representing
that right huey
get up huey
huey tomas staggers up to standing
jesus hijo de maria el virgene
vinh moves towards chuckie who is crouched over huey
scene page my little brother
he pushes chuckie gently out of the way so he can see
he stares down at hueys bloody meshed face
tomas staggers backwards and crosses himself
madre de dios
chuckie punches tomas leg
you tread on my boys face
you i didnt kill him
i didnt kill no one
tomas pushes chuckie backwards
she did it
she killed him
chuckie and tomas stare at each other
im gonna cross that bitch out
della runs for her life
she makes straight for the cover of the trees
she hesitates for just a moment after the first layer of pines
its pitch black beyond
then she steps in
she follows her breath into the icy blackness
branches and foliage scratch against her face
she grapples about looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms
steps between tree roots and shrubs
her eyes begin to adjust
she can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell looking back where the edge of the woods begins
a construction light shines behind like a distant moon
scene page she pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees some thick and knotted others slight and brittle
only the evergreens still have their foliage
looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys
fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together
where there just may be the right place to hide
she stops for a second to catch her breath
the handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm
she changes hands
god that boy huey
he really died back there
she heard the sound of it
the horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death
it could have been her
there has to be some way out of this nightmare
ahead a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path
she steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots
chuckies voice drifts towards her
she ducks down among the roots
her eyes scan the darkness
no moving shapes nor forms
just shadowy clumps of trees
should she stay put or should she run
then she sees it
the flashlight weaving through the pines ahead
she pushes further in among the roots tries to make herself invisible
the flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her
one set of footsteps crunches through the foilage
she holds still terrified
the flashlight pauses on the dead tree the roots
scene page della stops breathing
then the light sweeps past and on into the woods
she waits until it disappears before stepping out of her hiding place
she creeps back in the opposite direction figuring if theyre in the woods now she should get out
her eyes search for the construction light which indicates the edge of the wood
she heads in the direction of the light painfully aware that one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers
she steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer
the construction light grows closer
the light abruptly goes out
she stops eyes desperately searching the trees
she resumes in the direction she was headed
tries to keep calm
but the woods are impenetrable
layers of trees and shrubs and then more trees
deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow
shes losing her bearings
ahead the chilling sight of four luminous xs glowing in the dark forest almost makes her heart stop
she realizes the crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees marking them for death
she backs up starts off in the opposite direction
and there it is again
the flashlight sweeping through the trees in the distance
she stops close to screaming then when the flashlight disappears runs off in yet another direction
she slows to take a breath notices the butts of several cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet
scene page muttering to herself shit
she trudges on pushing between the branches no clue where she is headed
the further she treads the quieter it becomes
so quiet she can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees breathing
then she spots the light again in the distance shining out over the forest
she trudges up a slope ahead clinging onto branches and shrubs to help pull herself up
the light grows closer
she climbs up onto a ledge
a loud noise startles her
della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees
the woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing where a huge ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees
young pines about to become christmas trees
its blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie
a construction light illuminates the clearing
a ghostly vinh head hung low moves to the music bottle of beer in hand
propped up against a tree stump sits the body of huey arms crossed over his torso hood pulled up to cover his face
the scene is so surreal that della is drawn closer
she creeps along the edge of the trees
as she moves she kicks back on some dirt
it tumbles downhill into the gulch
but nobody notices
she slips invisibly between the trees and watches as tomas enters the clearing
scene page tomas stops and watches vinh
vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn japanese punk style
the juxtaposition between the hard core rap music and the serious vibe that vinh is sending out shows us that this is really important music to him
its a theatrical tableau della overhead looking down on the clearing
vinh transfixed by the music
tomas stone silent watching vinh
it plays out for a poignant moment
like theyre all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated
vinh pours some beer onto the ground at hueys feet
a small tear runs down his stoic face
the blaster is abruptly turned off by chuckie who appears out of the shadows behind it
he stares a beat at vinh like he cant believe what hes been seeing
vinh keeps on moving like hes in a trance
what the fuck you doing
vinh doesnt reply
stares down at the ground keeps on with his weird dance
chuckie moves towards him
tomas grabs chuckie tries to stop him from going for vinh but chuckie shrugs him off
chuckie reaches out and shakes vinh
he shakes him again
i asked you what your deal is sand dancer
the second shake sort of breaks vinh out of his trance
its a tribute
scene page vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet
your brain even smaller than em slits for eyes
vinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track replay
keep on banging out that ghetto ass shit and youll alert every cop in podunk county
its for huey
our dead homie
the song starts again
chuckie looks at him incredulously shouts above the music
you checked out right
he loved that track
vinh snorts back a sob
he hugs himself into a hunch and starts dancing again
chuckie loses it
he slaps vinh
get a grip skippy
vinh rubs his face
hes getting a grip all right
chuckie slams off the blaster
and aint no requiem gonna resurrect his ass
he down under the ground now with the real men of respect
the three boys stand somberly in silence each paying internal homage to their dead friend
chuckie hardens his heart against the tears that threaten to flow
tomas trembles mumbles
i didnt mean it
i didnt do it
i didnt mean to kill him
scene page this breaks the moment
chuckie snaps back
well he dead
thats it for him
but we still here
paybacks gonna be a real bitch for a real bitch
vinh wipes away his tears
she probably gone by now
you best hope not genius
she gone we gone
chuckie paces around the circumference of the clearing
dellas been watching the scene unfold a captive audience attentive and terrified
slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys
she backs away from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old tree
the branch digs into that point in her shoulder she hurt earlier on the barbed wire
she reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody
she reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue
feels something in her pants pocket
she pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper
she unfolds it
its tammis drawing
the one from the beginning
the stick figure family holding hands and mommy we love you written in stars
dellas lost in the drawing
her eyes drink in every mark and color and word
she sees that the male figure is slightly separate
that the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female
that the sky is turbulent
the stars clear and bright
a tear escapes from underneath her eyelid
scene page she might never see her kids again
she heaves with the release of emotion
more tears escape
she tries to bite it back
wills herself to stop
finds that rage takes sorrows place
rage and self recrimination
shes gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note
and god knows what will become of the kids
kenneth always told her she had a temper
that she reacts without thinking of the consequences
this time the bastard was right
she looks again at the picture
chuckies voice booms out into the night
she folds the picture up carefully and puts it back in her pocket
della edges further into the trees and disappears into the darkness
theres rustling in the darkness
tomas pushes through the edge of the trees making animal calls with his right hand curled around his mouth
the flashlight illuminates him from behind
chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of classic noir style
vinh slouches behind them
tomas heads along the ledge straight past the spot where della stood only moments before
tomas doubles back
thomas stops sniffs
i can smell her bulgari
chuckies behind him surveying the area with the flashlight
he finds several footprints by the tree
she was right here
must a saw your dumb ass tribute and everything
scene page vinh glares at chuckie
chuckie grins at tomas
she looks more like she rocks that number five shit
it bulgari dude
my dads bitch bathes in it
chuckie points the flashlight towards where the ledge ends and a steep incline begins
the flashlight illuminates a set of prints descending down the incline
there more of her footprints
tomas and vinh just stand like zombies
chuckie pushes vinh
what you waiting on
vinh plods clumsily down the incline followed by tomas
chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a sign of della
chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope
as the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of della between some rocks at the far side
but the boys eyes are elsewhere focused on the steep incline ahead of them
della quickly ducks draws her toolbox in tight and crouches low between the rocks
she watches the boys carefully as they climb down the gulch
theres the sound of a stumble followed by a splash
what now cabron
fell in a frozen ass stream
scene page chuckie sweeps the flashlight towards them
della sees vinh trudging out of the stream tomas descending the last few feet of the other side of the gulch and chuckie midway up
vinh jumps up and down trying to kick the water out of his sneakers
you know we dont speak the chinky
whats your game chuckie
we left stumbling around in the dark while you hog the flashlight
i stole it
i get to use it
thats how it works
that right tomas
right on dog
chuckie jumps down from the last rock and joins vinh and tomas at the edge of the stream
what if i steal it from you
there you go bro
he hands the flashlight over to vinh
vinh reaches for it
chuckie pulls it away
naw wait a minute it aint april
must be christmas fool
vinh hangs his head down
they search for more prints cant find any in the immediate area
chuckie shines the flashlight at the foot of a big rock
her footprints disappear at the big rock
scene page a beat
della clutches the lug wrench in her right hand
vinh shivers violently
head on up and search the slope
ill guide your way with the flashlight
chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch
della needs to get out of there and fast
they begin to ascend the rocks
chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them
della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks keeping as low as she can
dodging the approaching light
the boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals
dellas so low shes scraping her knees and hands to shreds
she can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin
what was she thinking hiding here
it was too exposed
we gonna put yo ass on ice bitch
god please help her make it back into the cover of the trees
della almost vomits
her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch
she pushes the toolbox up on the ledge
her strength is ebbing but she tries to hoist herself up
the flashlight sweeps by
she lets go of the ledge and ducks
the flashlight sweeps by again
she huddles in behind a rock
waits a beat
you going home in a casket tonight
oh shit theyre approaching fast
she tries again to hoist herself up
shes almost up when the flashlight sweeps by again
this time it catches her
scene page she practically throws herself over the ledge
tomas scurries to the top faster than lightening catches her leg as she crawls from the edge
she kicks him in the face
della grabs the toolbox
makes a run for it
tomas falls back from the gulch side loosening several rocks
the rocks tumble downhill hit vinh
chuckie scales the gulch behind them
vinh rubs his head
sees something between the trees
thinks its huey
he starts towards the brush
is that you homie
chuckie catches up with vinh breathless from climbing fast
vinh points into the brush
i saw huey there in the brush
chuckie looks around hoping against hope that vinh may be right that huey may just be alive
vinh becomes perplexed
i saw him
sure you did bro
chuckie puts his arm around vinh and helps him up the rock side
vinh is shivering so hard hes almost sobbing
just ahead tomas pulls himself up and over the ledge
scene page tomas catches up with della chases her into the trees
behind him vinh hoists himself up over the ledge then chuckie
faster than shes ever run before
practically flies through the trees
her breath comes hard
his too just behind her
their footfalls crash into the foliage
its dark so dark
shes running blindly
and theyre right behind her
tomas swipes at her
he just misses
he swipes again
a twisted shape looms ahead almost blocks her path
she runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment setting up thomas whos right behind her
tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk hits himself at groin level
he doubles over in pain
della races on
thomas gathers himself together picks up the chase
but that moments delay has bought her some time
her adrenaline pumps hard
eyes darting for a hiding place among the dark shapes and planes of the woods
there it is a deadwood pile
she throws herself down into its midst
the dried branches jag and tear at her hands and face
she burrows down low so low shes right in the dirt
she peers between the branches
tomass feet run by and disappear
she hears him circle the area then turn back towards her
a moment passes
she picks the next
rises slowly and softly from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench
scene page and then there he is
diving out of the trees towards her
della raises the lug wrench
in the clouded moonlight its an almost biblical image a woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross
tomas crashes towards her
della swings the lug wrench hard intensely directly at tomass face
there is a thud as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches him up under the chin
it sends him reeling
he goes down face first
della gasps in horror watches as tomas pulls himself up onto his feet comes towards her once more
della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the head
he spins clutches at his head then reaches towards her she loses it
she swings the lug wrench towards him
all the years of pent up rage finally find their release
the wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening crunch
it drives the cartilage up and into his face
blood spurts from the wound
he staggers backwards
a shocked scream escapes from dellas mouth
as she staggers backwards in the opposite direction
tomas tries to cry out but can only utter in pain
he tries to pull the lug wrench out of his face
the flashlight beam travels past them
scene page unnh
tomas crashes back into a tree
he loses consciousness
his body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt
blood gushes from where the wrench meets his face
he looks like hes dressed for halloween
della just stares
stares at tomas at what she did what she had to do
tomas eyes are wide open staring too at nothing dead
the horror of having killed someone overwhelms della
she starts shaking with shock
vinh cries out for tomas the sound of footfalls crashing through the brush follows
curb the squealing
you a gangsta or a boy scout
vinhs voice is breathless and jittery
tomass gone chuckie
i can feel it
della tears herself away from tomass body and staggers into the deadwood to collect the toolbox
it glints even in the darkness
she grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree
behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the flashlight illuminates vinh and chuckie as they march through the woods searching for tomas
tomas is one hard son of a bitch
he got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it
but chuckie doesnt look so sure
vinh charges ahead into the darkness
scene page della flashes briefly into shot running between the trees
the flashlight sweeps by
theres something over here
chuckie walks towards vinh
vinh takes the flashlight from chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three trees
it looks like a body
they close in on a muddle of shapes bush and spidery tree trunks
the flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and thick as a body
its a big old tree trunk you paranoid gook
chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from vinh but vinh wont give it
chuckie doesnt persist
vinh keeps going shivering and blustering
vinh senses something
he shines the flashlight behind the tree trunk
della darts between the evergreens behind them
she conceals herself in between the trunks and branches
braces herself waits for the right moments the ones when theyre not looking to run between the trees
cognizant enough to know they just want to find tomas right now
she seems to be on autopilot becoming numb as the minutes stretch on
she watches vinh plod forward and through the brush
he hits every inch of it with the flashlight
doubles back to follow chuckie
then the flashlight catches a glimpse of something
sweeps back illuminates tomass dead body splayed out on the mud at the foot of the tree eyes staring wide bloody ghastly
tomass catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight
silence until vinh falls to his knees in front of tomas tries to speak but only a whisper comes out
scene page chuckie realizes from vinhs demeanor that something really is wrong
he hesitates a moment then rushes over to vinh stares too at tomass body gulps back the desire to scream
he punches his fist hard into the tree behind tomas body instead
a shower of pine needles rains down on them
chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the body grabs vinhs arm grounding him
vinh sobs and shakes
she gonna kill you and me next
were all gonna die here
god knows what other tools she got in that box
it was a stupid ass accident killed huey
you know that
chuckie chokes up despite himself
he stands up brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt
he paces back and forth
he pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans
della creeps between the trees behind them
she appears for a second or two like a ghost behind the next tree
chuckie defiantly fights back tears
i promise you this
he kisses the gun
this babys gonna cancel her christmas
della darts between the trees faster now
their voices follow her
aint no gun can kill a ghost gone bad
scene page she staggers deeper and deeper into the forest into the darkness
you in america now dude where the ghosts bleed
she hears a faint gurgle
she slows listens
its the burble of a stream
she listens hard
traces the sound
treads towards it
there it is
glistening even in the dark
she steps between rocks walks straight into the stream below
she stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed clutching the toolbox
the water gurgles faintly below her so cold it almost sounds like glass breaking
the ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered for all time
shes talking to herself in a whisper
all she knows is that she just killed a boy
it may have been in self defense but she killed him
im so sorry
the grief overcomes her silently
her face crumples
her stomach muscles spasm and wrack through her body
a grief so deep tears would be a relief
where are you god
she falls to her knees in the stream
holding herself and rocking
the freezing water seeps up into her clothes her hair
scene page please i just want to see my babies again
her rocking slows until it stops
theres a loud crunch close by
she rises reflexively from the stream
raises the toolbox
she looks around
a branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her
this seems to bring her back to herself
she realizes its only a matter of time before they come looking for her
she needs to get moving
she sets off downstream
she trudges through the shallow water
her wet coat drags heavily
the stream must end somewhere likely at the other edge of the woods
she trudges onwards sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream
she now needs to pee
her temper surges up
she looks for the right place to do it realizes its probably best to pee in the stream so all trace of it will be dispersed
a leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream
she makes her way toward it
she lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches
we see glimpses of her lifting her coat pulling down her pants pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side
we hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream
more glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants smoothing down her coat
she hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox
she plows down stream once more
longing to see the light that will tell her shes at the edge of the woods closer to the mall lights closer to home
she swallows another wave of grief
scene page the stream loops around ahead then splits into two
she follows it picks the left fork
and then she hears it the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her
she doesnt even turn to see them
runs for her life
the glare of the flashlight blasts against her back
freezing water splashes up her legs soaking through her pants
her feet slip and slide over wet rocks
but she keeps running
vinhs behind her
she can feel his breath the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses
she runs even faster
she leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream
they leap behind her
she pushes through the hanging branches of several trees
pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes right into vinhs face
he tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes
he cries out covers his eyes
this buys her a moment or two to get ahead
the stream bends right ahead
she opts to stay in it
chuckie leaps out runs along the banks hoping to outrun and trap her
but the stream then bends left giving her an advantage
he leaps back across the stream to the other side
but shes outrunning him
he charges back into the stream behind her
della keeps on running through the stream somehow trusting its direction
vinh catches up with chuckie
the boys are maybe twenty five feet behind her
a shot rings out
then a bullet races past her ear
lodges in a tree just ahead of her
she almost loses her footing
shed forgotten for just a moment that they had a gun
another shot blasts off into the night skims her shoulder hits the muddy bank of the stream
she flinches braces herself keeps going adrenalin pumping harder than ever
scene page the stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead
for just a moment shes invisible to them
she uses it
when she reaches the rocks she dives out ducking below the glare of chuckies flashlight down behind the rocks
she creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows of some wiry shrubs as close to the mud as her back will allow
the boys stop by the rocks
chuckie sweeps the flashlight up the muddy embankment looking for a footprint a sign of her
she tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid leaving prints
tries to stay quiet as a mouse
stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by
if she can get to the top she can make another run for it
all of a sudden it grows dark
the boys must have switched the flashlight off or maybe the batterys dead
she listens hard for their footfalls
she sees that she is in the shadows of a big old pine tree
she creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently slides open the toolbox fumbles around for the screwdriver
she removes it from the box and grasps it tight
della rises slowly remaining concealed behind the tree
she reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk
she pulls herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk
she peeks between the branches
no sign of the boys
she pulls herself further up into the tree branch by branch
the thin stiff outer branches fringed with sharp little needles fall like a jagged veil around her
shes high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape below despite the darkness
she makes out the faint echo of voices strains to hear
scene page vinh and chuckie are arguing in whispers
vinhs pale and shivering hard
i dont feel good chuckie
you think i got the hypothermia
nah yo got the yellow fever
im telling you it aint natural how she gets away every time
chuckie clicks the flashlight back on
sweeps it up across and back down the embankment to the stream illuminating the banks
she got to be hiding up on the slope
you head up first and ill follow with the flashlight
the light sweeps past her
della shrinks further into the branches of the tree
she crunches her foot against a branch
the boys freeze then resume talking in whispers
i aint going up there without the gun
end of story
never wouldve pegged you as a pussy vinh
even when huey and tomas called it i always defended your ass
aint no one never said i was a pussy
she a skinny ass bitch too
cant be weighing in at more than one twenty
scene page tomas an huey never called me a pussy
i aint speaking ill o the dead
you already did
vinhs shivering so hard his teeth are knocking
anyways when you ever shot a gun
probably miss and shoot yourself in the foot
vinh paces braces himself to head up after della
vinh starts to ascend the embankment
thats the spirit gangsta
holler if you see her and ill shoot
vinh glares back at chuckie
della watches vinh plough through the brush
the flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements up ahead of him up the embankment
vinh pushes through several trees slips regains his footing
he plods past the tree
she slips the screwdriver up her sleeve
prays he wont stop
she pulls herself further up the tree
a sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her followed by a shower of pine needles
her heart stops
a moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by the squawking of angry birds
shes disturbed a birds nest
scene page she sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between
the crows circle the patch of sky above like a greek chorus
she looks back down for a sign of vingh
inches along a branch to see better
the light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line disorienting her
she hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree
her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her
she stares down at him frozen holding her breath
the flashlight illuminates the whole tree then sweeps away up the embankment
but vinhs seen something
he makes out her footprints under the tree
he leans down to check then rises looks up through the branches
their eyes meet
he opens his mouth to shout for chuckie
she leaps down through the branches
lands thud on his back
she silences his yell with a choke hold
wraps her legs around his torso
he bites her arm but she holds tight
panic has crept into chuckies voice
vinh topples to the mud dragging della with him
they roll as he desperately tries to disengage her
the flashlight frantically searches the area for them
della frees the screwdriver shed stuffed up her sleeve
she drives the screw driver up into the base of vinhs skull
scene page vinh screams
she thrusts and twists the tool
all the while shes tightly wound around him intertwined intimate as a lover
she drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair
vinhs scream becomes a high keening wail
the screwdriver pierces the base of vinhs skull
it protrudes through his mouth knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood
his scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins
they roll downstream
his arms are wrapped in a death grip around her
they roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down
she feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers
he becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her
shes trapped suffocating underneath him until she finds the strength to push him off
she crawls out from under his body
pushing him away sets him off rolling again
she tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady
her head hurts so bad its about to burst
the world around her shifts into a migraine zone
trails follow trees rocks brush
the desire to close her eyes to close it all out almost overwhelms her
her shoulder aches too and theres a new pain in her arm where vinh bit her
she sees blood has matted her sleeve and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark
theres a loud crash
della freezes and moves only her eyes looks around
its vinhs body hitting the stream below
scene page where was the light at the edge of the woods
nowhere to be seen now thats for sure
she staggers along the slope clutching onto tree trunks and roots as she goes
della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope
pulls it clean out by the roots
loses her footing reaches for the roots of an old tree
she pulls herself up
plods once more along the slope heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness
she arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness
but theres a strange calm about her now
like shes reached the eye of a terrible storm
when she hears his voice drifting faintly towards her she almost smiles
she knows hes coming for her and theres nothing she can do about it
della shivers as she sees a surreal tableau ahead four huge felled trees wrapped in white plastic
their sad stumps are only feet away
its the funeral parlour of the forest
della sinks down behind the large trunk of a plastic wrapped tree
she listens hard tries to fathom which direction hes coming from
his voice drifts in and out of proximity like hes pacing around in circles
his voice has changed hes dropped the gangster schtick
theres only you and me now
maybe if he wanders into the right position she can sneak up on him from behind
she rakes about in the dirt looking for a rock or a stick
then she remembers something sticks her hand in her pocket half smiles
scene page i saw a little trail of your blood back there
you must be hurt
della checks out the bite mark on her arm to find its still bleeding
im hurting too
i think you busted up my collarbone
his black silhouette appears ahead between the gray trees
i know you can hear me della
i can smell your blood your sweat
i know youre close
chuckies eyes glint in the darkness
after what went down tonight we got a special bond
della listens transfixed
his dark shape beckons to her
may as well come out now della
she doesnt move
she watches him pace around trying to work out where she is
he pulls out a pack of cigarettes taps one out lights it
ill save one for you for when you decide to come out
he inhales again exhales
he laughs admiringly
youre one tough bitch
scene page the tone of his voice begins to change
and thats hot hell yeah
frustration breaks through his voice
she can see his shadowy form moving through the darkness towards her
and theyre really cute
chuckie clicks on the flashlight shines it straight ahead right in between the plastic wrapped trees
chuckies eyes penetrate the darkness
terri and tammi
della doesnt move
i bet you could use that cigarette now della honey
he chuckles a womans purse can tell her whole life story
della stares petrified as he unfolds her purse from deep in his jacket
he empties the contents out onto the dirt
now i know where they are living im thinking i may stop by after and say hello
della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates
but she also knows thats what he wants and she refuses to give him the satisfaction
we move in closer on chuckie
hes looking right at where shes hiding pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask
they wouldnt know a damn thing about what happened to mommy while she was out would they della
scene page we move in on della
her knuckles are blue white and her eyes are blazing
rage explodes in her
she doesnt even realize that she is shouting till shes done
chuckie waltzes towards her hiding place
i figured that would help you find your voice
della crouches further in behind the felled trees
why the hell did she shout
she could have been hiding anywhere
now he must know for sure where she is
i would never touch them
its wrong to hurt kids
she clamps her mouth closed
chuckie continues waltzing toward her stops about twelve feet away
he stares in between the felled trees like he has x ray vision
the games over
sadness creeps into his voice
you took him from me
he was only seventeen years old
and all he ever wanted to do was see the ocean
and he never saw it
no he never got to go
chuckies grief sits like a stone in his throat
theyre all gone now
chuckie coughs a dry laboured cough
he hocks long and deeply in his throat
but whatever it is he cant spit it out
he rubs his throat and collarbone gingerly
scene page you know the movie clockwork orange
della looks puzzled
well they were my droogies della
chances are they would of turned on me anyway just like in the movie
chuckie paces around deep in thought
none of them was real ass outlaw
no not in the way you are
youre the real deal lady
i was already thinking about cutting some of em loose getting a new style posse together
dellas head is spinning
hows about it you and me
this cant be real
has he lost his mind
she utters under her breath
give me a break
chuckie reaches down retrieves her diary from the dirt
monday night mechanics
thursday i wish
he closes the diary
scene page face it della
you aint no suburban housewife
chuckies eyes dart around in the darkness
so you bought into the big lie even tried to live it
who could blame you
husband kids security every womans dream but not yours della
you know there aint no such thing as security
he coughs some more
but im betting you didnt really know who you were until tonight
i reckon i know what youve been dreaming about though what youve been aching for through all these lonely wasted years
blasting out of podunk without never looking back
feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers
doing all the things they told you you aint supposed to do
taking what you want from life
and wasting anyone who stands in your way
she closes her eyes like shes seeing it all behind them
dont say you aint thought about it
if its in your blood its in your blood for all time
a longing sigh sneaks out
you had yourself fooled della
a single tear runs down her cheek
shit lady you took my whole crew out with nothing but a bunch of them tools
she opens her eyes
scene page you cant go back to your old life
its all over for that
she doesnt know what to say
hooking up with mes about the best chance you got
he sounds deadly serious seductive even
shes lost in some kind of trance looking like she just might believe him
can she possibly be believing this
i bet youre on the outs with your old man
she inhales sharply
when we pick up your kids we can waste him if you like
she holds the breath in
i can do it
or you can if youre ready
della exhales responds
she seems lost to us
but she doesnt finish the sentence
she rises slowly from between the plastic wrapped trees
a momentary grimace of pain crosses her face
then their eyes meet like for the first time
it catches them both by surprise
leave the tools
i already did
he shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see where she is walking
scene page della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the stumps
she heads towards him slowly deliberately
chuckies hands are by his sides
she stops a few feet away from him
she can see him up close
the clearest view of him yet
they both look like theyve been to hell
hell of a night huh
he lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to point up through the trees and into the sky between them
i was only going to the mall for some christmas wrapping paper
they stare at one another all alone in the night
a knowing moment stretches between them
she notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his collarbone
chuckie smiles brings his teeth back into a scary feral grin
i wanted to look you in the eye before i kill you
della doesnt react
he brings up his hand gun clutched pointed and ready
della surprises him and us
thats what i figured
she nods her head points her chin over his shoulder
huey there going to help
scene page chuckie is puzzled
he glances to the side for a split second turns the gun as he turns his head
della slips the flare out of her pocket and opens it in his face
before he even has time to react she leaps at him with all the spring left in her legs
her fingers close around the wrist with the gun
the flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them
she crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken
it makes the ugly noise of sinew tearing
she tumbles him down to the december ground and wraps her legs tight around him
tight like a lover
she grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his broken collarbone exacerbating the wound
he cries out thrashes about
she keeps her body melded to his grinding her chin even deeper
he wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even closer wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone
they roll across the dirt
he whispers low and close to her
youre even better than i thought
he pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound
she tries to pull away but he only presses harder
neither can break away
its unclear whos got the gun
they roll until she suddenly pulls away sits up
but he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock
scene page and she has the gun
they look at each other
he makes for the gun
she fires into his chest just once its enough
his legs release
he slumps back
blood darkens his shirt
gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound
blood seeps below him from the exit wound spreading out in a dark puddle
his body surrenders to death
she stares down at him
a queasy silent moment passes
she stares at the gun in her hands
it feels so heavy so unreal
his dead eyes stare
she reaches over and closes them gently
and shes light headed so light headed she could just float away
somehow she stands up
she looks back down at the body not quite believing he could be dead
she sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood
she retrieves it
uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior
inside the photos of her kids are still there tiny photos of tammis little thoughtful face and terris mischievous one look back at her
she snaps the locket closed
she searches the area for the rest of her belongings finds her wallet her purse her diary her lighter her tampax box a lipstick in the dirt
she sticks everything in her purse
she almost misses her pack of cigarettes
we see them half buried under the dirt
she scans the area once more finds them
the pack is empty but she takes it anyway
its time to go home
without really thinking about it della slips the gun into her pocket and starts running
tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the light ahead
that place where the rest of the world meets the woods
scene page she peers through the last layer of trees like she would a curtain to her other reality the one she almost left behind
the housing development is still there and not more than a hundred feet away is her car
she hears the sound of distant sirens
she hurries across the clearing towards her car
sees the trunk is open
sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about
sees the big red bow tangled around a pine
she quickly gathers them stuffs them in her purse
a moment of trepidation as she reaches her car
what if its locked
what if the keys are gone
she presses the fords driver door handle and much to her relief it opens
she sees the keys still dangling from the ignition
she climbs into the drivers seat and turns the key
no surprises there
she steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again
the hood is still ajar by a few inches the weight of pine branches still pressing upon it
she uses the last of her strength to try push them away
a few smaller branches give way but the bigger one wont budge
she reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard
it scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it to prop the hood open to its maximum about fifteen inches
the hood buckles but theres enough room for her to reach in
she fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose from its attachment to the battery
she re attaches the wire and presto the car lights up and the keys start to ping
she almost smiles as she forces the bar back down
the hood slams down after it
scene page she quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys
the engine sputters but doesnt fully catch
she turns the keys again another wimpy sputter
again this time the sputter gathers momentum catches for a second gives up
she tries again the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real
della looks over her shoulder and backs up pulls out of the tree up and past the broken barrier and onto the road
she makes a tight u turn sticks the car into four wheel drive and plows down the rough gravely road
she passes the plymouth on her way
sees its wheels lodged deep in the mud
she drives right on through the ghostly housing estate slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves
empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind
the lights of the mall grow closer
she passes that stop sign sighs
the barrier is open and the road up to the mall stretches freely ahead
she slowly inches out on to the road and commits to her return to civilization
the roads empty
she punches the accelerator drives just over the speed limit
the concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands ahead on her left
she slows ahead theres a small traffic jam at the entrance to the mall road
scene page she hears the siren before she sees the police car
god she hopes they dont notice her smashed up windscreen the fucked up side of the ford
she edges slowly up to meet the line of cars
watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the mall road to join a police car that already has the mall entrance road blocked off
how long has it been
that poor security guard
she checks the car clock
its only minutes since she left the house
hard to believe
feels like another lifetime
another cop car whizzes past the line
how long before they come for her
shes got to get back to the kids
della adjusts the rearview mirror
her gaunt bloody face looks back
she looks at her hands theyre ingrained with mud and blood
and her clothes
while waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat finds some kleenex
she wipes her hands her face using the rearview mirror some kleenex and the rest of the water
she looks only slightly better
the line starts moving
she passes the police cars steals a cursory glance
she keeps checking her face in the mirror
the cars soon start to disperse in different directions
the mall disappears behind her
she turns left onto an almost empty road
she cant wait to see her babies make sure theyre okay
how could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this
scene page she hits forty forty five fifty
takes it all the way up to sixty
runs a light
as long as the roads empty shes gonna own it
at sixty five she races across the railway track
she slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road
with one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse
she carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips
she wipes it away
she drives through the crossroads
she applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color
but she just looks odd
she ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand
gosh this car in front is really taking its sweet time
she decides to overtake
she accelerates to sixty
as she passes the driver stares at her car
she slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion
she passes the familiar sign for pleasant valley drive
the roads empty ahead so she guns it to sixty five
the closer she gets to home the faster she wants to go
she tries to resist but cant
the speedometer hits seventy
the car hurtles into the night
oh no a red light ahead
and a car waiting to go in the opposite direction
she decides to slow for this one
barely makes it screeches to a halt
the driver in the forward facing car checks her out
she attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife
she waits for the car to pass then hits the accelerator again
she signals right turns abruptly into meet the gates of pleasant valley dream homes
scene page she rakes about in her purse for her chub card cant find it
she presses the intercom
no one answers
she presses again
still no answer
she backs out hard onto pleasant valley drive
luckily for her the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in
she tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers
but shes in
she guns it along pleasant valley crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for pleasant valley boulevard
checks herself in the mirror
pulls into the boulevard
when she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her
she snorts it back
her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like its made of stone
she pulls into the driveway
smooths her coat
she glances at the gun which lies on the passenger seat
she turns off the ignition
she looks back at the gun
she removes the car keys from the ignition
she glances at the gun
she looks at the house it all looks normal
she takes a deep breath
she moves to get out of the car
she leans over grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse
she finds her chub card inside
she remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car
that her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her
that her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow
the whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered
she makes her way down the path to the front door
she kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step
turns the adjoining key on the car key chain in the front door lock
pushes open the door
where the hell have you been
scene page kenneths voice meets her as she steps into the house
she doesnt respond
closes the door behind her
walks into the house
there he is ahead leaning against the office door
beer in one hand remote in the other
the tv blaring behind him
hes about to begin shouting again when he notices somethings not right about her
he switches the tv volume down using the remote
della honey are you all right
she stares back at him coldly
please dont call me that
dont ever call me that again
she steps slowly towards him
sees a violent adventure flick wrapping up behind him on tv
the end credits scroll down the screen
i just wanted to get home to my babies
kenneth cannot understand her garbled words
he sees the dried blood on her chin matted mud on her coat
what happened to you
she just stares
was there an accident
scene page she keeps staring looks at him with a cold odd expression
she needs to be held like a child but he doesnt even move towards her
just stands there like a jerk unsure of what to do so he takes a swig of beer
are you hurt
that swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to stone
are they okay
without waiting for an answer
she turns and races up the stairs
she opens the door softly
the night light casts a pale glow out low across the carpet
there they are all tucked up in their quilts breathing gently little faces flushed with sleep
she sighs closes her eyes with relief softly closes the door behind her
walks back downstairs
kenneth is pacing about the kitchen opening another beer
sound asleep huh
kenneth unsure what to do tries to make a joke
whatd you bring me from the mall
della sighs calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket looks him right in the eye points the barrel at his face
scene page he shrinks back silent for once blind panic playing across his face
but not hers
shes cold cold as the icy night
she pulls the trigger at point blank range
click he recoils
but no bullet disengages from the barrel
she knew there were no bullets left
but the click echoes throughout the silent house
