cars taxis limos line the street
a cab pulls up and man in tuxedo moves into through arriving guests we pick up the man climbing stairs to the ballroom
the man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her
when he turns we get our first view of dr
richard kimble a tall athletic man with a trim beard
he moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical fundraiser
doctors and their spouses hospital brass and sponsors mingle
women sit near the runway watching the models
men talk by the bar
the room is packed
a banner over the rostrum says childrens research and kimble is handed a glass of champagne which he promptly sets on another waiters passing tray
roberts a large surgeon pulls kimble over to a group of surgeons gathered around a bar

nearly gets hit in the follow through of an imaginary golf swing

kimble and helen introduce themselves to others at table ant sit across from each other
kimble sits between two doctors wives
one now eau wife mid thirties bedecked in jewels and loud dress the other helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress her with the details of their
boring studies as credits intercutting with the fashion catches of dialog and course changes kimble and helen demonstrate an oft used exchange of glances kimble while gracious to his dinner partners catches helens eye and makes smiling subtle movements to his watch or a look to the door to indicate hes clearly ready to leave
on the receiving end helen the gatekeeper of their social propriety indicates with equal subtlety not yet

nichols shakes his friends hand in passing
from across the room we see lentz watching
kimble and helen driving home
she runs her fingers through his hair as he drives

he smiles to himself seems to enjoy the compliment too much for helen
her smile becomes playful mischievous
most men in a tuxedo look like waiters

a band director
he stops at red light leans over and kisses her
light changes and neither notice
slowly their kiss breaks

kimble pulls up in front of his house
suddenly both his pager and car phone ring at the same time
to phone dr

helen kisses him again opens the door

he sticks his head into the operating room
two harried surgeons look up glad to see him

to circulating nurse send it downstairs and make sure you get kath her slice

kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown
i got a date
kimble throws away his hat and mask
the door opens behind him it is the other surgeon
kimble driving through empty chicago streets toward home
he is on phone waits for answer
im five minutes away
helen on the phone downstairs
she is still in her gown with an afghan around her shoulders
shes been reading
im glad it went well
ill see you in a minute
helen hangs up phone turns out the light and starts up the stairs
helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room closet
opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on the light
she starts to leave and decides to close one of the interior closet doors
she starts to slide the door closed when wham
a hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck
helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts
and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom
rolls across the landing to the stairs stopping three steps from the top
snow swirls around the street as kimbles car pulls into the driveway
on the third floor we see a bedroom light still on
a grandfather clock ticks softly
kimble tosses his keys on the entry table picks up a stack of mail on the table and calls up the stairs
did you hear who won the bulls game
he steps into the the wall phone shows a line in use
kimble notices it
the washer buzzes he switches the clothes from washer to dryer and starts the machine
takes a bottle of wine and two glassesand leaves the kitchen
lies on the floor beside helens legs and the receiver of phone off the hook
a mans rubber gloved hand picks up the gun
kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom
helens hand reaches out presses the cradle down dials climbing the stairs
a small white ball on the stairs
he bends down and picks it up
he can see directly into the bedroom
he notices a lampshade on the floor
kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway
and just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door
kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free
before kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him
the attacker immediately goes for the gun
kimble grabs a leg and twists him down the mans fingers hit the gun sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge three flights
to the entry hall below
sirens can be heard
distant but approaching
the man kicks free and tries to flee
this time kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle
to his shock the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow
kimble looks at the arm in his hands its hollow
electrodes are visible inside then to the mans unreadable face
the sirens are louder
before kimble can recover the one armed man knocks kimble down and grabs back his arm
he runs down the stairs
kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped by a voice behind him in the bedroom
still in the house
lying by the bed helen kimble clutches the phone with one hand her head with the other
did i hear you right
your attacker is still in the house
hes trying to kill me
helen drops the phone when she sees him
will you repeat that please
to kimble richard
hes trying to kill me
two chicago police cars wheel to the curb cops move quickly to the house
kimble moves to her
sees the necklace of bruises where she was held down and choked
and then a bullet wound in her leg
shes already going into shock
her speech turns thick
hang on babe
going to be all right
her fingernails dig into kimbles arm trying to hold on
richard my hold me
her eyes slip away from his
he peels away the hand on her head and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes she wont be all right
camera swings down to the dropped phone
you said his name is richard
maam can you talk to me
the cops enter the house
lying on the floor
covering each other they move quickly up the stairs guns drawn
the first cop gun drawn turns the corner of kimbles bedroom and finds kimble holding his dead wife
blood on his hands
move away from her
kimble numbed by the event washes the blood off his hands in the kitchen sink
a cop takes his blood stained tux jacket and another hands him a parka
the street is filled with chicago police cars curious neighbors television news vans etc
kimble is helped into a police car as the coroners van arrives
he pauses a moment to watch as we hear
can you give us a little more to go on besides the fact that he had an artificial arm
what kind of gun was it doc
camera finds kimble in an interview room
he is in why shock
two detectives kelly and rosetti
kelly the questioner is overweight aggressive
he shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down
i only saw it for a second
i knocked it out of his hand
as kimble is questioned we intercut with flashes of the murder scene being processed forensics technicians photograph the
at the base of the stairs
do you own a gun dr
what kind of gun
did you have your key with you tonight dr
checking doors of house for signs of forcible entry
rosetti answers it
kimble watches him write something down he slides it to kelly
your wife was loaded wasnt she
i mean she was worth quite a bit of money
kimble looks up at the two cops
for the first time he seems to sense something aggressive in their questioning
they no longer seem on the same team
whats going on here
this guy was trying to rob us
the two cops stare at kimble
you guys have got to be out of your minds
i didnt kill my wife
he gets up to go
a cop blocks his path
he turns and looks at kelly
lets start over dr
whatd you have for breakfast
kimble in his tuxedo shirt and black tie holds a booking number plate in front of him as a mug shot is taken
front then side
were all adults here so ill lay it out
chicago sun times has a photograph of kimble spread across the front page
if you two come up with a deal ill listen but let me make one thing perfectly clear
salesmen continue to hawk sets
kimbles photograph comes up on a hundred tv monitors across the store
police are revealing no details in the case against chicago surgeon
kimble lays on his bunk
its an election year
camera moves through smoke fillet room to find tough female prosecutor a man in late forties walter gutherie and stops on the source of the voice weve been hearing and
the cigar judge bennett late fifties
fair but no nonsense political survivor
and this case is a heater
it will not end up a bench trial
richard kimble in county lockup fatigues and a navy watch cap moves down long corridor escorted by guard
weve had private investigators interview over a hundred amputees richard
walter gutherie his attorney stands by a window looking out at the yard
another attorney randolph watches gutherie
we cant find this guy
i know what i saw walter
i put you up on the stand to say what you saw without anything that remotely smells like proof and the states attorney is going to take this one armed
man story and run it up our ass
he holds kimbles look look richard youre paying us a lot of money to defend you
a plea to second degree i didnt kill my wife
kimble being escorted back to the courtroom
a guard carries his suit in a bag
he is taunted by other prisoners
youre a successful upper middle class white man charged in a violent crime
on the other side of the door is the courtroom
a sheriffs deputy hands kimble now wearing his suit a small plastic bag
in it we see his wedding band
its a circumstantial case but its also a jury trial
we play em they play em
richard kimble sits at defense table
watches prosecutors chat with helens relatives
media anchors glare at him
but if we lose we lose big
just remember theyre lined up a block long to have your hide
a crime scene photograph
on the stand
no forcible entry was found
from the beginning of the investigation it did not appear to be a break in
nothing was missing
on the stand
the defendants prints were found on the neck gun bullets and lamp
no other sets were fount other than the deceased
they listen to the recording of the tape
did i hear you right
your attacker is still in the house
hes trving to kill me
will you repeat that please
hes trying to kill me
a few members lean over to make notes
its powerful taken out of context
you are aware that richard kimble was the only beneficiary of helen kimbles estate
million dollars roughly
i was aware of that
the money meant nothing to him
yet in your presence richard kimble once said that if he had helens money he could find plenty of uses
did he not
we were talking about yes or no
nichols look tells us everything
on the stand
the wound to the head caused a massive hemorrhage to the brain
it took from five to seven minutes for her to die
a woman in the jury reacts
on the stand
he finishes his moving description of the events
we see some of the jury has been moved
and i was holding her when the officers came in
gutherie returns to his seat
the prosecutor moves to the jury
he begins slowly but his questions pick up strength
how tall was this man dr
i cant be sure
we were mostly on the floor fighting
i couldnt did that fight cause the scratches on your face and arms
as i explained and how did this man enter your house
i dont know and you probably dont know why your wife told the emergency operator you were her attacker
she didnt your name is richard isnt it

richard kimble sits behind the desk but already hes a shadow of the man we knew before stares ahead passively as judge bennett delivers the sentencing to hushed courtroom
after careful and studied review of all evidence presented during each phase of this proceeding and because aggravated circumstances detailed at length were present the night of january th
kimble is silent stunned but all around him the sentence shockwaves through the courtroom
reporters push out rear doors
prosecutors share a look with a hangmans satisfaction
nichols watching behind kimbles table lowers his head
he remains silent
kimble is pulled gently to his feet by bailiff
gutherie whispers an im sorry
kimble doesnt hear it
therefore it is the decision of this court
looks over his shoulder to the emptying courtroom
faces stare back
judge bennetts v
continues over a locker opening
inside a profusion of chrome and nickel plating
handcuffs dragged out
that you be remanded to menard state penitentiary
slapped down over wrists ratcheting down tight
ankle cuffs dragged out
pant legs raised canvas shoes exposed
cuffs clamped down on ankles
chains rattled out
snaked across the floor
looped around waists and locked to handcuffs to form belly chains
where you will serve a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole
the chain gang exits through the sally port
kimble and three other prisoners
jailers escort them to
an illinois department of corrections guard moves alongside checking the undercarriage with a pole mounted mirror
the gavel cracks as we locking wire mesh cage inside bus
an old diesel coughs to life
main gates open
the bus grinds onto the streets
the four prisoners sit scattered still cuffed but no longer chained together
near the front prisoner is eyeing
the two prison guards seated beyond the caged door
young guard lighting a smoke
old guard drowsing
shotguns bouncing on their knees
prisoner l shifts his gaze to
pistol on his hip
the bus rumbles north heading towards the horizon
through caging hey
illinois penal regulations require a meal for transport rides of four hours or more
young guard shakes his head
fucking jailhouse lawyers
checks his watch
old guard yawns to his feet unhooks a key ring from his belt
young guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker
prisoner looks at kimble
kimble stirs awake
watches the cage door open young guard moving back
and across the aisle
prisoner a big man named copeland wags his head between his knees
something slides out of his shirt and clanks to the dimpled steel floor
its a razor sharp plastic shank
heart quickening kimble looks forward
young guard is handing a petrified sandwich to prisoner
kimble snaps a look back to copeland who palms the shank
breathe and youre first
old guard watches from the open cage door shotgun carelessly ready
young guard reaches kimble and extends a sandwich
kimble doesnt respond
he offers the sandwich to copeland
in the exchange sandwich drops
copeland leans down for it
up front old guard yawns again just as
jackknifing up copeland drives the shank into young guards gut
prisoner dives for young guards holster
as the gun comes out young guard gets a hand on it
a shot fires
jolting old guard
he chambers his shotgun
kimble hits the floor
the old guard jams a key into the cage door and surges inside but
prisoner broadsides old guard
opening a big gainsburger hole in the driver
he sinks under the steering wheel
a knee hits the accelerator
the cage door slams locked behind the old guard
as the bus careens off the road accelerating
young guard wrestles gun from prisoner and fires killing prisoner
copeland grapples with wounded young guard
old guard shotgun butts prisoner flips the gun pumps one round into the mans chest
he turns just as
as the driverless bus bucks ant bangs over open ground
old guard reloads
copeland drops down behind a seat
old guard jams his shotgun under the seat
but just as the old guard pulls the trigger the bus jerks
the shot goes off target as
the bus roars into a gravel embankment
roars up the slope and crashes down on its side sliding to a stop at the bottom of a small ravine
we dont know up from down
on his knees old guard makes his way to the driver
finds him dead
now a sound
old guard whips his shotgun around at
rising between the seats
a hairy beat
old guard might kill him just to finish things off
but a groan turns old guards head
young guard trying to hold his guts in
old guart turns to find kimble
to kimble you
youre a doctor
he slides to the young guard as the old guard scrounges up a medical kit shoves kimble down on young guard
kimble looks at his cuffs
old guard digs out his key ring and unlocks kimbles hands only his hands
kimble opens medical kit
its been ransacked just band aids now
kimble looks into the wound
he isnt going to make it unless he gets to a hospital
in this delicate moment a shiver runs through the bus
is it just settling
with other things to worry about kimble tries to stop young guards bleeding
we see copeland alive
the crash has ripped the bars from a back window and shattered the glass
he works to get out the opening
a second shiver ripples through the bus stronger
kimble retracts his hands to touch a metal panel and feels a growing vibration
just where the hell are we
the old guard feels it too
he gets down on his knees and looks out one of the shattered barred windows
the bus lies across railroad tracks
a not too distant bend grows bright by the light of an approaching train
kimble sees old guard fights the cage door
kimble lunges to his side
wherere your keys
downtrack one cyclops light appears
kimble spots keys
pitches them to old guard
drags young guard to the front for a quick exit
but old guard fumbles the key ring his hands shaking as much as the bus
the train light spider webs across cracked windows
kimble snatches the keys away from the guards trembling hands
old guard gulps a nod
kimble jams a key in the lock
throws the door open
grabs young guard
help me get him but old guard climbs right over kimbles back and climbs out the shattered windshield
copeland escapes through the hole in the back
and hits the ground running the other way
the locomotives headlight reveals the toppled bus
train light grows
a nanosecond of uncertainty should kimble leave the wounded man
kimble and the young guard hold a look
as the wheels brake and lock
kimble struggles out of the bus pulling the young guard behind him
he slings the man clear
screeching death the train skids closer
for one heartbeat kimble remains perched atop the bus
the train light x rays him
gains his feet
tries to sprint away but cant his feet are still chained
he gets off a dozen mincing steps before
impact a hundred tons of steel slams into the bus splitting it open
shrapnel rips through kimbles thigh but he stays on his feet still running feverish half steps
an explosion envelops the train
flames stream down its flanks
the train burns past the wounded guard
kimble looks back expecting to see the catastrophe behind him
but he gets the shock of his life of any mans life still on its wheels the locomotive is derailing and coming after him
its the stuff of nightmares one little man being chased by a fire breathing locomotive
the train burrows to a stop
kimble is suddenly five feet taller standing on an upheaval of earth staring eyeball to eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him
coughs on smoke
then notices something in his hand
its the key ring
kimble sits and searches the key ring for manacle key
suddenly a hand reaches down and snatches the key ring away
give me that
kimble watches as copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his own chains
you listen to me
i dont give a damn which way you go just dont follow me
kimble takes the key as copeland wraps his chains around his arm and runs
kimble unlocks his leg irons and runs in the other direction crossing a hilltop in the moonlight
news and sheriffs department choppers circle billowing smoke
tilt down to reveal the derailed train
fire engines hose down the blackened locomotive
rescue workers work feverishly with jaws of life to get into the mangled wreckage
illuminated by spotlights transportation investigators in blue coveralls pick through the twisted remains of the bus

the sheriff opens a file and produces fax photos of all four prisoners
to old guard for the record
these three dead
and this one
he switches to a photo of kimble
well everything happened so fast
bites lip decides huh uh

sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners then files kimbles fax photo with the others
you get some rest
he pats the guard on the shoulder and approaches gerard
looks like you came a long way for nothing
my menve already done a thorough search from point of impact and found nothing
biggs and newman stop by the muddy culvert
biggs sees something
he orders newman into the muck after it
aware of media proceeds patiently with the young sheriff
with all due respect may i suggest check points starting at a mile radius on i i route east of whoa whoa whoa
prisoners are all dead
the only thing check points will do is get a lot of good people out here frantic and flood my office with calls
gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young sheriff and we get our first taste of gerard at close range

he slaps the file of fax photos at gerard on his way out
just as biggs spotless eases ino the group with kimbles manacles
behind biggs we see newman covered in mud
seeing the leg irons the sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop
now gerard takes his run at old guard
please ladies and gentlemen step back and give this poor man some room
like an obedient dog the press backs off they sense a change of story and command
gerard kneels down with poole and renfro in front of the old guard
the sheriff hovers near

gerards large hand extends palm up at the old guard

now turn those damn things off and get out of our way
just above the treetops
helicopter speeds up a dark river
its tracking beam illuminates the river bank
two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks
the squawk of police radios breaks the rural quiet
a moment later a helicopter roars overhead
kimble moves down train tracks
his jumpsuit is wet with blood from the gash
he pauses and checks the wound
hes going to need stitches
far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights
he keeps moving
kimble crosses a tressel keeps running toward the direction of the lights
a junk yard by railroad tracks and a road
signs along the road show were on the edge of town
one says hospital mile
kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks
as he nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign
hes close but he cant go into the hospital in his prison jumpsuit
he leans against a wrecked car and catches his breath
just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook turns off the road and parks next to the tracks
kimble ducks for cover behind the wrecked car
the driver climbs out dumps his coveralls in the front seat and closes the door
he moves toward a house across the tracks then forgets something and returns to the cab
he throws open the door and grabs lunch box off the seat and we notice the coveralls missing from the seat
as the driver returns to the house we move to the opposite side of the car to find kimble ducked beneath the window clutching the coveralls
a crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent near the crash site
maps are laid out on tables
power and phone lines are pulled down from the lines running along the tracks
renfro supervises the electronics
poole handles phones takes a report from the field and relays it to gerard
blood trail found
two miles southwest
to biggs type it and match it against all four prisoners
to renfro renfro get an i
fax on kimble to every local hospital
to newman newman
i need some coffee
as newman steps off everyone turns at sound of shouting from the train crash
a rescue worker shouts up to others
hey ones alive
loading dock outside the e
a worker stacks boxes of food outside kitchen entrance
kimble in the tow truck operators coveralls picks up a box and carries it inside
once inside he branches off down a hallway
a door opens on a long hallway
a doctor child with a bandaged hand and a mother leave a room and walk toward us
behind them kimble moves down the hall and stops in front of the doorway
kimble closes the door and locks it
hanging on the back of the door we see a doctors white coat
an illinois state troopers car pulls up outside
on it we see a packaged sterilized bandage an opened antiseptic wash an opened topical anesthetic and an empty syringe
we pull back to find his wound bathed in orange antiseptic wash three stitches already in
with pair of forceps he picks up the needle as he sutures himself
at far end of the hall we see a state troper chatting with a duty nurse at a nurses station
kimble his bandage already in place gives himself a shot of antibiotics
a man tube in nose on two i
s lays in bed with eyes closed
kimble comes into frame near his face
can you hear me sir
the man is out of it
kimble backtracks to the patients closet and opens it
hanging inside we see his clothes
he removes them and notices the mans untouched breakfast tray
the duty nurse and state trooper chat when a fax begins coming through on desk fax
theres your fax
kimble dressing in the mans clothes
he eats a piece of toast part of the mans breakfast as he buttons up his shirt
his arm slowly reaches out and presses his nurses call button
a fax photograph of richard kimble slowly comes off the duty station fax machine
next to the machine the patients call light comes on
the duty nurse standing with the highway trooper sees the patients light come on and starts down the hall toward the patients room
kimble shaving when we hear the duty nurse enter the patients room
he moves out of frame
patterson do you need some more water
the duty nurse looks from the tray to the man impressed
oh you did a good job on this
she takes his empty plastic pitcher and
pushes open the bathroom door no sign of kimble and refills the pitcher from the sink
over her shoulder to patient it does get dry in here doesnt it
she doesnt expect an answer turns off the water and goes into the main room
as the door closes we see kimble behind it
kimble clean shaven and wearing the patients glasses and a doctors white coat moves down the hall to the emergency room exit
suddenly the state trooper steps back from the e
admissions desk with his newly received fax and starts down the corridor toward kimble
the trooper looks up as the two men pass
scuse me doc
kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the e
doors behind him
dont know if you heard or not but were looking for an escaped prisoner from that bus train wreck couple hours ago
thought he might show up here if he was hurt
whats he look like
the trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down kimbles cheek
from fax sheet approximately six one pounds brown hair brown eyes and beard
at the last second kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes it clean as the trooper looks up
seen anyone that fits that description
every time i look in the mirror
but without the beard
kimble moves through the e
doors as an ambulance parks outside
two paramedics try to take out a patient on a gurney
the lead wheels are stuck
kimble helps clear the wheels so the collapsible gurney comes free
thanks doc we had to dig him out from under a train
as the gurney comes out kimble looks right into the face of the young guard
the guards eyes suddenly open wide
its kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the young guards mouth and keeps his hand there
how is he
the paramedics move him toward the ramp
hes pretty bad off
broken leg ribs
as kimble moves away
tell the e
doctor hes also got a perforated spleen
the two paramedics share a look as they whisk the young guard inside
impressed jesus how could he tell that from looking at his face
kimble climbs behind the wheel
a full communications link is in place
deputy marshals answer phones work faxes add information to a situation board
troopers bring in information
poole calls gerard
background just came in from chicago
renfro and poole lay out the details
the download of information comes clear and fast
richard david kimble
convicted of first degree murder in the killing of his wife
claimed a one armed lets not retry the case
priors and accomplices
gerard steps up the hillside out of sight of the investigation to take a leak
followed by renfro and poole
no previous arrests
poole takes up a position discreetly behind tree as gerard unzips his fly and relieves himself
sealed juvie record
poole calls out from behind tree

gerard zips up
cover his lawyer first
never get it
renfro wont take it
have stevens go to judge rubin hell sign em
biggs charges up the hillside
wounded guard swears to high holy he saw kimble right there in the hallway
ambulance missing too
gerard moves quickly to the map
give me a time
o nine thirty
twenty minutes ago
gerard redraws the circle of units
no longer are we covering a fifty mile radius
the circle is redrawn tightened with the hospital as its center
the triangulation is set
the ambulance follows three cars toward a rural railroad crossing
were waiting up here in canton
wondering if you heard anything on this kimble chase kimble behind the wheel as he approaches the railroad crossing
the biocom monitors police chatter two twelve a be advised that all discussion on this matter is to be conducted on a tactical frequency either channel k or z
frequency goes dead
kimble looks through the windshield an arrow points toward canton two miles
the cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal suddenly activates and the bars begin to drop
kimble pops the siren and hurriedly snakes through the crossing and heads in the opposite direction
but his maneuver gets attention
truck driver watches kimble cut through the crossing and reaches for his c
poole hangs up phone
ambulance just spotted two miles west of doverville
heading north on state road
renfro turns to the map and marks it
the circle is much smaller
running outta map sam
the crash site and hospital are already marked
gerard is ready to move
just the way we want it
okay people lets button up
they move off to waiting state trooper cars and helicopter
kimble driving down a rural road
he flips down visor and eyeballs folded roadmap
the ambulance crests a hill
in the distance we see the grosvner viaduct and the barkley dam
blowing other traffic off the road whooping cruisers and g cars stream south through the rugged rural terrain of southern illinois
overtaking them all a chopper thunders overhead
heading into hilly terrain
down below we see the ambulance
inside the helicopter gerard eyes the terrain
into radio weve got a visual
to gerard hes heading toward the viaduct
seal it up
the two lane road disappears into long tunnel
three hundred feet below the road tumbles the tennessee river
the barkley dam rises ahead
kimbles ambulance roars into the tunnel
suddenly sees the helicopter setting down ahead of him at the mouth of the tunnel
kimble slams on brakes and turns to retreat
illinois highway patrol cars pull to a stop at the far entrance
set out road blocks
gerard steps out followed by renfro and poole
comes to a stop blocking traffic in both directions
immediately horns begin blaring
trooper pulls up
biggs and newman behind kimble blocking the other end
troopers with guns drawn block the exits
from a state patrol car blares please remain in your vehicles and lock your doors
repeat please remain in poole and renfro materialize already decked out in kevlar
theyre jacked up and ready to rock
renfro hands gerard a vest
gerard unholsters a caliber glock model
okay ladies and gentlemen hard parts over
he starts into the tunnel
to radio were movin in
weapons drawn but held discreetly at their sides three silhouettes enter
drivers who hadnt heeded the troopers p
warnings take one look at gerard and quickly climb back inside and lock their doors
biggs renfro and poole fan out to the sides and give the middle to gerard
the tunnel is quickly quiet
kimble huddles at mid tunnel
drops to the ground beneath the truck
his heart pounding brain clicking fighting panic
suddenly he realizes hes in water
they reach the mid tunnel area
biggs looks around beneath vehicles
poole looks confused
whered he go
gerard spots the trickle of water
he backtracks it until he finds a loose grate in the pavement
biggs renfro with me
kimble splashes blindly through ankle deep sluice
he slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction
a dull roar comes from somewhere from everywhere
he whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel then continues straight ahead
somewhere behind lights probe splash patterns on the conduit wall telltale signs of kimbles passing
the lights belong to
gerard biggs and renfro
they push on soon reaching the forking tunnels
renfro finds the jacket ant splash signs
they conform their radios
splitting up biggs and renfro go left
gerard straight ahead
bracing with all four limbs
negotiating a mossy downslope
biggs and renfro
sweeping his light as he advances
searching for splash patterns
into shoulder mike nothing yet
probing a branch off tunnel with his light
about to pass he notices scrapings on the mossy walls of the branch off tunnel
into radio got a possible here
he stows his light but hangs onto the glock
bracing with three limbs gerard begins the tricky descent
and tumbles out of control
gun and radio clatter away
scrabbling for purchase he finally snags an overhead pipe
sweeps his light to locate his glock lying down tunnel
he eases toward it
but another hand gets there first
face dark and desperate
hand flexing on the pistol
they lock eyes for a beat
i didnt kill my wife
so you didnt kill your wife
not my problem
an adrenal beat
for a moment they hold a look
then the silence is broken by gerards radio
gerard looks for his radio then back at kimble hes gone
instantly gerard reaches for his ankle and pulls a back up piece
as renfro hears footsteps pounding his way
gerard charges down the tunnel
from a side tunnel renfro appears almost colliding
kimble sticks gerards gun into his waist band to balance in the tunnel
he spills around a corner and stops
ahead lies an orb of light
the tunnel ends
the noise is incredible
kimble moves to the end of the tunnel and stops
water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below a great cauldron of mists
none visible at least
he hears the marshals behind him coming closer
gerard and renfro turn the corner
renfro drops into a shooting stance
turn around hands over your head
and get down on the ground
for a moment kimble eyes gerard
your choice kimble
kimble turns his back on the marshals stares again at the water
slowly he puts his hands over his head
gerard puts up his gun and pulls his handcuffs
he moves through the water toward kimble
get down on your knees
kimble bends slowly stares down into the falls hears the footsteps get closer then does the unthinkable
biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees kimble leap into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into the mists below
he cant believe his eyes
renfro lowers his gun
amazed son of a bitch
its the most amazing thing hes ever seen
he stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down
he stares down into the mists
it has told him something invaluable about this fugitive
gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam near biggs just as squad cars troopers and the search helicopter converge on the site
far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend
the snag a tree branch breaks away and heads down stream
hanging onto the branch we see kimble
below the dam and spillway
troopers in waders search the shallows deputies beat bushes along the shore
farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters
gerard watches the dredge cage come up again
as if with the next pass it will prove him the victor
the head illinois trooper captain approaches
running out of daylight inspector
lights and generators are coming captain
look i dont mean to tell you your job but maybe one person in a million couldve survived that fall
the guys fish food
gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the captain
then find me the fish that ate him
he turns and heads to a waiting helicopter
kimble runs through the woods
he staggers his arm hooks a sapling which spins him to the ground
he lays motionless exhausted
helen in bed
kimbles hand comes into frame and touches her shoulder
she turns toward kimble as he moves into frame and kisses her
helen tosses her head back
she wears white silk pajamas and smiles down at us
a hand reaches up and unbuttons the top two buttons of her top
then kimble moves up into frame as we helen running down beach toward us
embraces kimble as we helens head comes up out of a pool
hair tossed back she smiles as we helen exiting kimbles car the night of the murder
she looks back at kimble framed by the door frame ant smiles
i love you
then kimble comes out of his sleep with a start
he remembers where he is
his breathing returns to normal
kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into tunnel
kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for party to answer
an old lady and her mother shop
across the store a pharmacist watches kimble
kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer
we hear ringing then a receptionist answers the law offices of gutherie morgan and wainwright
walter gutherie please
im sorry mr
gutherie has left for the day would you like his voice mail
kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle stopping in front of the hair color
he takes a box of black hair dye off the shelf and looks at the instructions
when he looks up he sees the pharmacist looking at him
a roadside diner
kimble his hair now black and wearing a new pair of wranglers hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat moves down the road to the diner
he sits at the counter and a sparky older waitress late mid forties with strong good looks and tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks
need to look at the menu
some soup please
she marks her pad and leaves
sights ant sounds around kimble begins to occupy his attention a dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen
he stares at him
a farmer sitting at a table stares at kimble kimble looks away
a man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him
is he calling the police
everyone seems to be looking at him
someone stops in front of him
a young waitress serves him his soup
wheres the first waitress
takes a few sips of soup
out of the corner of his eye he sees the older waitress putting on her coat to leave
is she going to report him
he fights the paranoia
a news report on the television gets his attention
a report on the escape
a television reporter describes the chase for kimble his jump at the dam and his presumed death from the fall
kimble decides its time to leave
he drops some money on the counter and exits
kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until hes out of sight of the diner
once free of the lights of the diner he starts running and disappears into the night
kimble running down the road
fields stretch out on both sides of the highway
from behind him we suddenly hear the sound of police sirens
for a moment kimble moves faster then as the sirens come closer his sprint drops to a jog
to a walk until finally he stops and waits for the inevitable
but the flashing lights suddenly rip past him chasing a speeder
they werent after him after all
kimble looks at himself
a moment later he is lit by headlights
a car pulls up next to him passenger window rolls down
need a ride
kimble stares at her
which way are you going
she smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling
they hold a look as we hear we feel confident about the i
a quiet house on a quiet street out from town
a homeless woman picks through garbage
a garbage truck moves slowly down the street
a plumbing truck parked along a curb
just early morning traffic
we see renfro and newman watch the house from across the street behind a deserted house
gerard joins them
we see that biggs is in the plumbing truck
poole is the homeless woman picking through the garbage
newman hands gerard a radio
local officials were about to wet their pants to move in
i bet they were
to radio wheres the woman
in the plumbing truck
he triggers his mike
into radio same room
into radio okay
ill take front
biggs and renfro rear
poole handle support
i dont want anyone hurt

radios on three
the deputies prepare their weapons
newman checks his service issue
stares at gerards glock
uh just want me to wait here sir
youre with me newman
door crashes open splintering the deadbolt right out of the door
textbook perfect gerard and newman rush into front room
down the hall a mans figure streaks across a doorway out a woman in the rear of the house begins screaming
motions newman to the left to check the door off the living room while he moves down the main hall into the back bedroom
clearly unnerved by the screaming woman newman opens door off the living room
the door opens into a smaller bedroom
he steps into its empty
gerard appears at the other hallway door to the bedroom
gerard motions newman on to the door to the bathroom and continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the woman continues screaming
he ignores her
his feet move silently heel to toe
he checks the bathroom as newman opens his connecting door empty then moves on toward the doorway to the kitchen
gerard moves to the kitchen doorway
running out of house
he braces himself swings into the kitchen it too is empty
suddenly gerard gets the bad feeling hes passed his prey
newman looks around suddenly scared
the only place he didnt search was behind the bedroom door
he turns just as surges out knocks newmans gun from his hand
in a flash copeland yanks newmans arm behind his back and presses a knife against the deputys neck and moves him out of the room
he hears copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house
i got your man
now i want outta here
gerard moves back through the bedroom past the screaming woman
he locks in on the voice and sound of the moving fugitive
copeland listens but gets no response from gerard
he backs through the second bedroom door pulling newman into the newmans eyes are pure terror the blade pressed against his throat
to gerard you hear me
i said i want out or ill cut your mans throat
keeps moving down the hallway through first bedroom pauses at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course
copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the hallway opening
hes troubled he cant hear gerard
suddenly he hears a noise behind him at the bedroom door he whips newman around and we see a shoe hits the floor
copeland realizes his mistake too late
he turns back to the hallway and there is gerard
he never blinks
fires once killing copeland instantly
the knife falls to the floor
newman clutches his head stunned but unhurt
gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the bedroom doorway
as coroners and tactical police mop up
gerard moves across the yard sips coffee from styrofoam cup
he stops at a sheriffs car newman sits on back seat shaken nearly hysterical clutching his ear
i cant hear a thing out of it
i cant believe you did that
you think i should have bargained with him dont you
you couldve missed
you couldve killed me
yeah youre absolutely right
they hold a look
how bads your ear
i probably have permanent hearing damage
let me see it
newman leans toward him
gerard speaks into his ear
i dont bargain
newman watches him realizing what a truly unsettling man gerard is
kimble makes call
while he waits for phone to be answered trains come and go in the b
an el crosses overhead
the bells of chicago river drawbridge
walter gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking lake michigan
jesus why did you run
running only makes you look guilty
i wasnt worrying about appearances walter
tell me where you are
ill come meet you so you can turn yourself in
im not turning myself in
i need money
gutherie is silent
when he speaks again his speech takes on the lawyerly tone of a man whos covering his own bases
youre asking me to harbor and aid a convicted felon
i cant help you that way
my advice both as a friend and as your legal counsel is for you to give yourself up
now tell me
where are you
kimble picks up the change in his attorneys tone
give me an address
ill be click
gutherie hears the line go dead
kimble stands in the doorway with cup of coffee
he considers his next move
then seeing bank clock flash the time he knows what that move is
an upscale mid town tennis club
behind glass windows of the entryway we see tennis courts
from the courts comes dr
charles nichols still dressed in his warmups carrying his tennis bag
a friendly desk attendant sharon smiles as he goes by
see you tomorrow dr
creature of habit sharon
nichols leaves the club
he tosses his gym bag into the back of his car and drives off
as he pulls up to the first stoplight a homeless man moves toward the drivers side and begins washing his windshield
nichols waves the man off
not today please
the man shuffles off
just then a second man appears at his passenger window
he leans down to wave him away no
not then stops the face at his passenger window is richard kimbles
stunned oh my god
nichols rolls down the passenger window
howre you doing charlie
and i need your help
i need some money
whatever youve got on you
nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs for his wallet
tell me where youre staying
ill get you more money
just give me an address
ill call you
kimble glances around the area is still clear
he looks back into the car and doesnt see the police car turn the corner and come up the street behind them
nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash hes got to kimble who quickly pockets it
i know why you came back to find him
if i can help call me
they hold a look
the stoplight changes to green but they dont see it
here richard take my coat
he reaches into the back for his coat suddenly police car behind him pops its siren
nichols looks into his rearview mirror
sees a cop lean out his window
to nichols hey buddy green light
nichols looks back at kimble
the media room just what it sounds like banks of audio video equipment and a sound board
renfro rewinds the tape
gerard biggs poole and newman

renfro hits play
kimbles voice is heard again drop the voices
renfro removes the two voices

they dont know hes alive and as far as kimble knows we dont either
i want to keep it that way as long as we can

the whole group sense gerards intensity in regard to kimble
for the group perfectly
gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction
go to my office and lets officially take dr
kimble out of purgatory
morning roll call
kimbles photo distributed to cops by detectives kelly and rosetti
as of this morning chicago p
was alerted to the reappearance of richard kimble
newman and poole check train station
looking for kimble
they show his photo to homeless people
holding a handkerchief to his face kimble moves through arriving patients and enters cook county hospital
renfro and biggs check shelters for kimble
they show his i
the place is humming now
detectives kelly and rosetti sit in front of gerard
gerard studies kimbles file
renfro sits in
police units have also increased patrols around homeless shelters and mass transit stations in the city
police patrol the platform looking for kimble
kimble moves past security then pockets the handkerchief and turns up a hallway blending in with the indigents and poor
nurse flynn a woman about attractive smart loyal
poole and gerard talk to her in an examination room
i ran his office for twelve years
yes we were very close
but he wouldnt come to me for help
busy with doctors orderlies and street people
kimble moves down hallway and enters
he moves into the room and takes a new patient form looks around
see back into the office area of the clinic
it could be any hospital clinic from this view
but as kimble turns to leave we see a patient waiting to be called
on his lap we see a prosthetic arm
kimble looks up from the arm to the man
as he turns to leave we hear dont underestimate this guy
roberts from the party talks to biggs and gerard as he takes off scrubs to get into shower
s one smart cold sonofabitch
he did her no question
kimble moves down the hallway containing the janitors locker room
janitors move in and out the door
gerard walks through kimbles house
the art and most of the furniture is gone
books are in boxes and shopping bags around the room
plastic covers the remaining pieces of furniture
gerard stares at the empty walls
shadows on the walls show where the art once hung
gerard pauses tries to absorb the place
he takes a book from one of the bags and looks at it
kimble moves past the lockers racks and boxes of cleaning supplies stops at a board listing work schedules vacation leaves locker numbers
behind him a locker slams
as a janitor moves off to the showers we see his locker did not close but remains slightly ajar from the impact
door opens revealing the janitors clip on i
hanging from a green shirt
kimble steals it
gerard looks at the two detectives
gentlemen i appreciate the cooperation of the chicago police
he moves toward them
a salesman stands on ladder looking through pants sizes
did you say
a folded pair of green janitors pants drops onto the counter in front of kimble
he already has the green shirt to the uniform
kimble takes the finished photos from the delivery tray
was there anything in your initial investigation that would make you think kimble would come back to chicago
the man definitely has friends here
what about lady friends
not that we found
a card on a community bulletin board advertises a basement apartment for rent
what about the man he claimed attacked his wife
kimble pulls the notice from the board as we kelly and rossetti share a look a smile
you ever been downwind of a stockyard when the breeze is blowing
thats where we were sitting when richard kimble told that one
kimble knocks at door
it is opened to reveal a punk kid
he calls to someone o
a light comes on and an old polish woman her stockings rolled down her shins leads the way down the basement stairs
the punk kid stands at the top of the stairs watches kimble
we found nothing
the polish woman shows him a spare but sufficient bed and nightstand set up
she points to door leading up to the street
kimble also at work at the bedside table
he carefully cuts out his do it yourself photograph and places it over the existing photograph on the hospital i
the name on the i
says desmondo jose ruiz
then he places a thin piece of lamination plastic and trims the edges
kimble defaces the plastic to give it rough look then examines the finished product not bad
if this guy existed believe me someone wouldve found him
he raises an eyebrow
of medical residents
two photographs next to each other
a young richard kimble and charles nichols
i saw him two days ago
we pull back to see gerard studying the photos
renfro looks up like someones bitten him
he biggs and gerard are in nichols administrative office
filled with awards and photos of nichols and influential people
nichols hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat
he shows no sign of nervousness
he stopped me in my car
i gave him some money
where was this
outside our tennis correcting himself my tennis club
gerard moves around nichols office taking in the details
did he ask you for help
he wouldnt accept it
why do you think he came back to chicago
he didnt tell me
i didnt ask you that sir
im sure he was trying to protect you from having to lie for him
gerard continues to move around the room study prints books drawings awards and photos
if youre really his friend youll help us bring him in unharmed
why so he can go back to prison
if you want help gentlemen youve come to the wrong man
gerard finds a photo of nichols and a gleaming ferrari
nichols last year the u
marshals office closed out warrants
of those were captured
the twenty eight others thought they were smarter than us
now theyre dead
re the photo nice car
gerard puts the photo down
gerard and his deputies leave nichols outer office
gerard clearly feels hes come to the right man
stay on him
kimble mopping the trauma room hallway
the hallway elbows around a corner and kimble stands less than ten feet from a door that is marked prosthetic clinic he watches a technician leave the clinic and mops
closer to the doorway and fails to see an attractive woman doctor with white coat and stethoscope draped around her neck turn the corner behind him ant step on the freshly mopped section
head down she is completely absorbed in a file and doesnt see the wet floor until she slips slightly looks up but keeps walking
they said hes sick
didnt they tell you to put up the sign
no they didnt
put up the wet floor sign before someone gets hurt
she keeps going
she looks back at kimble
what did you say
anne keeps moving off toward trauma hall
he watches her turn the corner to the trauma hallway
kimble enters the dimly lit prosthetics lab
he moves silently among the casts and prosthetics of arms hands legs hanging from the ceiling
cables and electronic equipment are on the counters
he leaves the lab and moves into the office section of the prosthetic clinic
he passes a computer room and finally reaches the office
he is about to enter when a womans voice stops him
werent you just in here
kimble turns to see a prosthetic technician
a large woman with glasses
she stands with a partially finished prosthetic arm
the one armed mans arm coming off in the fight
sorry i thought you were ricky
ive got to clean the blinds in the office
want me to wait till youre finished
im going to be here all night
you wont bother me
she slips on a pair of headphones and goes back to work
kimble cleaning the blinds keeps an eye on the technician who is listening to music on her walkman
she is carefully painting a section of the arm
not watching kimble
nimble looks over his shoulder
the technician doesnt see him
a prosthetic clinic operations manual is removed from shelf
photographs of prosthetic arms
kimble shifts the materials into his clothes closes his coat and suddenly he stops
kimble waits for the elevator
the folders in his uniform shift and he tries to rearrange them
when he turns back we see anne eastman beside him
says anne eastman
she sees him doing the rearranging
the elevator arrives
they step into anne moves to the back
kimble on the other side
hey howre you doing
you find that sign
yes i did
you called me an asshole
i was having a bad shift
they reach ground level and step out together
you worked at other hospitals
lots of them over the years
here long ago
hasnt changed much
i bet it hasnt
they part ways
kimble continues out the door
anne stops and watches him leave
kimble sits on the night train going home
he begins looking at his information
afternoon light comes in kimbles basement windows
sheets of prosthetic clinic patient material are spread over kimbles bed floor
kimble searches through the documents making notes
he studies photos of attachments
looking for a key to the identity of the one armed man
finally he stops
he finds the flyer in his pocket puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink
he wets a towel and covers his face
draws a cool damp breath
lays back on bed amid the prosthetic clinic material
kimble pulls the arm
it separates in the one armed mans sleeve
reacts in pain
note we sense kimbles mind returning to something
getting closer to the key
escaping the bedroom
we hear his footsteps down the stairs
a door slam
another door slams but this time the sound is distinctly different
a car door
kimble yanks the wet rag from his face his senses alert
listening he hears footsteps are real just outside and moving toward him
a car door slams
we see unmarked police cars pulling up in front of the apartment
cops are moving toward the house
kimble turns off his light moves from the bed to the window
carefully looks out unmarked police cars in front of the house looking moving his way
kimble moves instinctively to the back door
he starts to open it but through the dirty window he sees the back courtyard covered by more cops
kimble moves back toward the front
unsure of his next move hes sweating preparing for the worst
he watches the tac team charge the house but instead of charging through the basement door they move up the front steps and into the house overhead
overhead he hears the screaming from the arresting cops
kimble sees the punk kid try to escape out the back
he runs sees cops and runs toward kimbles basement door actually reaching it before he is caught by the cops and pulled away
moves toward the front window and watches cops lead the punk kid out to the car
police radios call the other cops to stand down
kimble moves slowly to his front door
cops put the young man into an unmarked police car
his grandmother the polish woman follows them crying
kimble leans against the wall exhausted
kimble carries his cleaning tray down busy hallway just outside of the prosthetic clinic and stops
two cops talk outside the prosthetic clinic
kimble backs to a safe place in the trauma hallway to wait for them to leave
the punk kid is handcuffed to a bench as a cop works on a report
suddenly the kid notices something that gets his attention
a wanted poster of kimble over the cops head
the kid sees wanted for murder realizes who it is
to cop hey
i know that guy
the cop looks up sees kimbles poster and then back at the kid
kimble moves toward prosthetic clinic
in passing through the trauma hallway he becomes aware of a crisis developing
a major accident has happened victims are being brought in
calls for doctors
elevator doors open as orderlies bring in new patients
some walk some are helped by family and police
nurses direct traffic
medicines are called
family members yell for doctors
ask for the injured
anne picks up the pace with an orderly wheeling a gurney carrying a young patient a boy
a bus flipped off the overpass
got at least twenty more coming in
what about this one here
x rays coming up
anne checks the boys chart
okay weve got to get some room in this hallway people
orderlies quickly move the non life threatening patients out of the hall
still more help is needed
anne spots kimble
hey take this one up the hall to critical care
anne moves to another patient
kimble grabs the kids gurney and begins wheeling it up the hall
as he pushes he looks at the kids x rays
anne looks up barks another order then suddenly sees kimble pushing the gurney and looking at the film
tries to negotiate through the incoming patients to get a better look but kimble is gone
she goes back to work
he wheels the boys gurney into an elevator
the doors close
kimble wheels the gurney down the hall and stops the boy on the scrub threshold to the o
and stops a surgeon
a surgeon pauses and eyes kimbles janitor suit and the gurney
they just sent this one up
he takes a look at the boys chart and grabs the x rays and yells to o
get this one into room four stat
he looks up kimble is gone
kimble enters the prosthetic clinic computer room
the technician from the day before is listening to her walkman sees kimble and waves
kimble waves back and turns into the glass walled computer room and closes the door
he closes the blinds and turns on the computer
the crisis has wound down
anne moves into the room and begins checking patients
she stops a unit nurse gladys
gladys wheres the boy i sent down with the janitor
the one with the fractured sternum
he never came in here
kimble scans dos files each an eight letter enigma
finds one with promise and loads it up
he backs up and tries another file
kimble knows hes got it
kimble keys in these responses anne comes out of the stairwell and stops the surgeon we saw with kimble
dave did you see a janitor come up here earlier
yeah he brought a kid up
handing her the chart anne did you write the orders
i couldnt make out the signature
i saw in a hurry now whoever did knew what the hell he was doing
kids a hair away from a ruptured aorta
he heads to the operating room leaving her stunned
she stares at the scrawled orders
a please wait message appears on the screen
we hear the computer processing searching narrowing
the screen flashes seventy five
kimble types in another defining characteristic
again he waits
rattles the blinds to make it seem like hes cleaning
the list shortens
prosecutor stands before the jury
murdering helen wills kimble the night of january
kimble types in candidates having adjustment appointments between january and february
sixty five names come up
again too many
kimbles reached a dead end
the fight with the one armed man
something has clicked in his memory
kimble stands beneath the hanging artificial limbs
he takes down an arm works the joint
kimble fights the one armed man
he wrenches the mans prosthetic arm
he moves it again
harder at an awkward angle
kimble wrenches the arm
the joint strains
kimble wrenches it and it breaks
a detailed diagram of arm construction
kimble makes notes
anne rides the elevator back to trauma
joint repair list between january april
five names come up with greater chicago addresses
kimble hits print
the machine begins printing
kimble looks up at the prosthetic clinic technician she is listening to her headphones cant hear the printer
he continues to shake the blinds
kimble leaves prosthetic clinic and starts down the hall for the exit when a voice stops him
do you have a particular interest in our patients x rays
kimble turns to see anne coming toward him
what do you mean
i saw you looking at that boys chest film
she moves in on him
he eyes the exit
its a hobby of mine what other hobbies do you have
what do you want
she reaches him
i want to know how that kid ended up in surgery
im a janitor
i did what i was told
who changed those orders
they hold a look
he takes a step back and she pulls his i
you stand right here
im calling security
anne turns to call security but doesnt
she stares after kimble
kimbles room being searched by the marshals
gerard finds the flyer kimble was handed on his way out the door
on it we see cook county hospital
anne and gerard stand in the hallway
gerard studies the i
a man posing as a janitor orders an emergency operation and all you do is pull his i
firmly a little boys alive today because he did something
gerard watches her eyes carefully
so you werent aware that when he escaped he was being transported to menard state prison to begin a term of life imprisonment
for murdering his wife
clearly this is news to anne
gerard almost smiles at her surprise
thank you for your help doctor
he moves to the position anne saw kimble with the kids gurney
trying to imagine what kimble was doing at that place
renfro and the other deputies converge
what i cant figure is if you were kimble whyd you take a major league chance of hanging around a trauma ward
gerard considers this as a man passes him
gerard notices something
the place would be crawling with cops
slowly gerard separates from the group of deputies and follows the man down the hall
the man gerard is following turns the corner to the prosthetic hallway and realizing gerard is following him holds the hallway door open for gerard
can i help you find something
thank you sir i think you already have
we see the man has a prosthetic arm and that they are outside the door marked prosthetic clinic restaurant deserted at this hour
kimble makes calls
this is dr
elway at cook county
im doing follow up work for the prosthetic clinic on matthew zelick
beat he did
im terribly sorry
no ill correct our files
he scratches through another name
he dials another number
gerard and his deputies inside the prosthetic clinic
artificial limbs are being tested fitted
a technician fits a demonstration model on biggs while gerard and poole work with the director of the institute and a data operator at the computer
the onearmed man
missing the right or left hand
the operator enters that information
dropping the number to
as poole continues
kimble on phone
he hangs up and scratches through another name
he dials another number
poole looks up from her file to the computer screen
the number drops to
location of the attachment
from the report mid humerus
the next name is clive driscoll
kimble on phone waits for answer
looking for your brother clive
this is ted riley with the high school reunion committee
believe it or not years is just around the corner and clives on our list of lost souls
information gave me a number but when i tried it
wider to reveal kimble on the pay phone
the scrap of paper is his list of five
forced laughter hes where
gerard looks at the screen
the number drops to
it could take us a week to track down every one of those names
gerard picks up phone and dials a number
into phone stevens
ive got a list of names i want searched for criminal history
kimble stands on a sidewalk staring at the imposing edifice across the street
after a here we go breath he starts through traffic
kimble waits for an elevator
it opens to reveal a pack of staring cops
catching door comin or not
forcing his feet to move kimble boards
and pivots quickly
floor indicator moves deathly slow
kimble feels the breath of a dozen cops on his neck
and just when his floor is mercifully about to arrive
overhead lights flicker and the elevator jars to a stop between floors
anybody bring a deck of cards
abruptly theyre moving again
kimbles heart restarts with the elevator
to visitor booth three
no hands on the glass
five minutes maximum
be advised that under a federal court ruling your conversation can be recorded
next is kimble
he steps to the counter
name of inmate
the clearing officer spins his clipboard around
sign here print your name address and relationship to inmate below
into mike two zero ten
driscoll clive r
to kimble be about five minutes
you can wait in the hall
gerard and biggs cross the lobby and stop in front of the desk flash their u
to clerk we need to see a prisoner
gerard and biggs head for the bank of elevators
man risks everything to find a man his own investigators say doesnt exist
somethings really hinky about this thing
gerard looks at biggs as they reach the elevators
i hate that word
he hits the up button
clearing officer looks down the hall
visitor for driscoll
kimble is on his feet
no hands on the glass
the clearing officer head down drones on doesnt notice kimble is already gone
kimble strides down the row of chairs rounds the last partition to reach booth seven and to stare at the one armed man driscoll who waits there
so who are you
driscolls face is different
driscoll is a black man
i made a mistake
shit thats okay
stick around a few minutes talk about whatever you want
but kimble is gone
driscoll calls after him
theyre not exactly wired for cable downstairs yknow
kimble exits the visitors area
he sees another crowd of cops around the elevator again opts for the door marked biggs and gerard wait for the elevator
finally gerards had enough
wherere the damn stairs
its five flights
then you wait
he finds the door and starts up
doors open and close throughout the stairwell but the traffic is light
climbing the stairs
he reaches a landing and skims shoulders with kimble who pivots past on his way down
amazingly neither man reacts
one flight above gerards subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop
he leans over the stairwell railing to spy
kimble spiraling downward
from this vantage it could be any dark haired man
a quick probe kimble
others look up out of curiosity
but not kimble
two landings below he falters a step then tries to regain his step keeps moving
but gerard is pulling his glock the hitch in kimbles stride told him everything
kimble blitzes down the stairs
gerard moves after him
kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby
sees two cops quickly approaches
officers theres a man in the stairwell waving a gun and screaming
the two cops rush to stairs and kimble immediately moves toward the doors fast but not running
hoping to cloak himself in civilians
biggs elevator has finally arrived and emptied
he lets a woman on in front of him oblivious to
the revolving exit doors loom nearer ant nearer
the two cops see gerard
gerard holds up his badge
get on the phone call your commander tell him theres a top fifteen warrant in the building
he shoves the cops out of the way and pounds downstairs
kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a klaxon horn sounds
people stop in confusion
automatically the exit doors begin closing
biggs pushes his way off the elevator
kimble breaks into a sprint for the door
bursts out the stairwell door after kimble
but theres only one way of stopping kimble
enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside
the big man sizes up the situation realizes kimble is fleeing and just before kimble exits yanks on the door trapping him partially inside the revolving door
other doors seal electronically
biggs charges back sees gerard
kimble fights the heavy glass door
the big man resists but slowly the crack widens
gerard bulls through the crowd shoves a man out of his line of fire
with adrenal effort kimble wrings his body through the opening
and makes it outside except for his foot caught like in a bear trap as the door locks down
harrowed kimble looks back over his shoulder at
charging the glass doors
civilians suck marble and clear out of gerards line of fire on kimble
gerard takes aim
its kimbles nightmare coming true
if he could chew off his leg right now he would
he pulls at his foot just as gerard fires seven times in two seconds
kimble goes down
shots and screams echo around the lobby
a long beat then gerard rises
through glass studded with bullet holes he sees
equally astounded that hes alive
he runs free
open the doors
gerard pounds against the doors
sees cratering in the glass and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor
its bullet proof glass
through the glass he sees kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade
doors open and gerard and his men follow
but kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside
blending in with the marchers
kimble leaves a cheap hotel early the next morning
he wears a new set of clothes jeans sport coat and tie than the day before and the black hair coloring has been rinsed from his hair
he moves down the street
kimble uses a pay phone and stares through the window
across the street
inside the apartment the phone rings
no one is home
the phone rings nine ten times
as kimble waits he looks down at his list of five
the only name remaining is fredrick sykes
he looks down the street it seems clear then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees
he approaches a car parked along the curb
the passenger a woman leans across the seat and opens the door for him
he hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in he shifts something on his hip we see the butt of a handgun
kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door
kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind sykes apartment
he looks in the window steps back to see if anyone is looking then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop breaks the glass
slowly he moves into
moving first toward the living room
the apartment is modest
he stops by a photograph of a teenage girl
another is a boy in football uniform
the next one is a man in a police uniform
kimble struggles with the one armed man
kimble struggles to recall the mans face
it could be him
kimble searching for clues to sykes identity
he opens closets wardrobe bureau
reopens a drawer
there in the bottom he finds an old prosthetic arm
kimble looking through sykes desk drawers finds a package of photographs
he opens them and quickly flips through
a group of men on a business vacation junket stand around a large sportfish hung from the dock
kimble keeps flipping through suddenly stops and backs up and we see what stopped him the smiling face of dr
nichols introduces kimble to lentz
there are three photos of lentz
kimble slowly pulls one out of the pack
as he slides it out we see a fish and on the other side we see
sykes wearing a prosthetic arm
kimble struggles with intruder
this time we see his face clearly
it is sykes
kimble flips back to the earlier group photos and we see a devlin macgregor banner over the group shot
hes found the man hes looking for but also a new possibility that the murder wasnt just a random act of violence
kimble digs through sykes top desk drawer
his mind reeling
he stops the devlin macgregor pharmaceutical logo in the top right corner
payroll level four security
secretary answers it
her expression changes to shock
gerard is moving down the hall with a cup of coffee when the secretary appears at a door
it kimble on line three
gerard moves quickly down the hall mobilizing his troops as he runs
they follow him into
gerard moves to phone as technician gives him nod hes ready
gerard answers the phone and the trace begins
this is gerard
beat do you remember what i told you in the tunnel
you told me you didnt kill your wife

gerard is calm
i remember you were pointing my gun at me
you said i dont care
the numbers rush down
technician reads the first set to renfro
a whisper hes on the southside
thats right kimble

the room is filling up with deputies
poole biggs stevens newman
gerard watches the numbers as the second digit locks in
low hes in pullman area
fifteen seconds for location
well i am trying to solve the puzzle gerard and i just found a piece
kimble takes the phone and bangs it down onto a table and we realize he is in sykes kitchen
the sound startles gerard
kimble leaves the phone on the table and walks out
into phone you cant control this thing kimble
he thinks he hears footsteps over the phone realizes kimble has not hung up
whats kimble doing
to renfro where is he
renfro looks up from the address to gerard stunned
incredulous holy shit
weve got a car there right now
he picks up a phone
the two cops receive a radio report about kimble and quickly exit their car
they rush toward sykes building
while they move into the apartment we see kimble fully aware of them slip away down the alley
close on list sykes
lines draw connections
kimble and chief resident work feverishly to save patient
this an r
kimble looks up at the resident as we
close on telephone receiver
it buzzes off the hook
name is fredrick sykes
a hand comes into frame ant replaces the receiver on the cradle
we widen to find gerard
we see technicians dusting room for prints
a forensic tech approaches gerard
inspector were ready for you to look at this
the forensic tech sits at desk
kimbles prints are all over the apartment but the concentration is here
the tech takes out the check stubs some papers the pack of photos
the tech flips through the pack stops on the lentz sykes photos
he flips through the pack but paused here
he hands the lentz sykes photo
let me see the negatives
the tech hands him the strip of negative film
gerard holds it up to the light
gerard stares at the photo as his radio squawks
on radio here he comes
fredrick sykes the one armed man comes down the side walk
he passes a car and hears the door open behind him
biggs climbs out of the car and falls into step behind him
sykes hears the footsteps but moves on up the stoop and starts to enter his apartment notices the front door already open
cops and marshals in his house
processing a crime scene
what the hells going on here
who are you people
sees gerard in the kitchen
gerard stares at sykes
you had a break in mr
you a cop
my name is gerard
sykes is caught off guard
this morning a fugitive named richard kimble made a call from your apartment
sykes is dumbfounded
i dont know a richard kim poole produces a photo of kimble
wait a minute
this is the doctor who killed his wife
he claimed the killer had a prosthetic limb
you telling me hes coming after me
would he have a reason to
what the hells that supposed to mean
because i have this
he lifts his prosthetic arm and stares at gerard
gerard holds his look
look a year ago some people came to see me
they asked me questions about the night of the murder and ill tell you the same thing i told them
i wasnt even in town then
i was on a business trip
gerard continues moving around the apartment
what kind of business are you in mr
no i work for a pharmaceutical company
i handle security for its top executives
gerard holds up one of the fishing photographs with lentz
any idea why kimble would be interested in these
just some doctors on a company junket
gerard puts the photos down with the one of lentz on top
sykes eyes it
annoyed look you mind if i talk to the cops to see if anythings missing
by all means
sykes moves off and gerard pockets the lentz sykes photo
gerard crosses the street with renfro and biggs
hes pulling our chain sam
if this was the guy kimble was looking for why call us
kimble said hes putting together a puzzle
we dont need to put it together too we just need to be there when he gets to the next piece
gerard stops and looks back at sykes apartment
keep somebody on him
if he moves i want to know
kimble moves through large medical library and turns into area marked pharmacology
pages turn as we get closer on headings drugs pending fda approval
experimental and commercial names move past us
and at the end of the list we find provasic rdu developed by devlin macgregor pharmaceuticals
kimble opens to article entitled devlin macgregor expects paydirt with provasic
pharmaceutical company plans to go public on introduction of new drug provasic kimble looks up
now he knows why someone tried to kill him
he gathers more devlin macgregor information including a prospectus and leaves
an operator answers a call
into phone im sorry sir dr
nichols is at a medical conference at the hilton
its very important i reach him
a meeting is underway around a board room table
an assistant moves around the table and gives nichols a message with a number and urgent written on it
im sorry sir they said it was an emergency
nichols excuses himself from the table
kimble answers a pay phone when it rings
urgent can you talk
nichols on phone at the other end of the suite
the meeting continues behind him
as soon as he hears kimbles voice nichols reacts
im on a hotel phone
whats going on
he eyes the group in the other room moves around the corner for more privacy
as he does we notice several of the men watching
they exchange glances
i found him charlie
i found the guy that killed helen
its all about a drug charlie
they tried to kill me because of a drug
devlin macgregor and lentz
lentz was supervising the r
he knew id found out the drug had problems
richard lentz is dead
he died in an auto accident last summer
kimble is stunned
can you prove this about the drug
i need your help
roosevelt and tell him im coming in
the group of deputies and gerard assemble around gerards information board
theyve come armed with facts and theories
gerard orchestrates the information
if you were richard kimble
why would you hunt for a one armed man you think killed your wife find hint then leave him and call us
to throw us off his trail
what if you were a well respected surgeon and wanted to kill your wife
how would you do it
id hire a pro
set it up to look like a robbery gone bad
how would you find him
look in the phone book
through a connection
maybe through a company you did some business with
like a pharmaceutical company
someone in security
on the night of his wifes murder kimble attended a hospital benefit sponsored by devlin macgregor pharmaceutical sykes company
gerard places a devlin macgregor card onto his board
but sykes claims he was out of town
and company records support that he was on a business trip
thats an easy fix
so lets say he was in town
did the job
everything goes as planned with one problem
instead of looking like a robbery gone bad kimble ends up being the one accused
and the hit man gets away clean
so kimble returns to hunt for and find the hit man
to share the blame
hed still go to prison
gerard moves to the board
he takes down a card
youre underestimating the power of the good doctor
it would be his word against
who would you believe
so what does kimble do next
gerard pins the card to the board and looks at renfro
it says nichols stevens check phone records for sykes and kimble
gerard moves to the door and renfro follows
as hes leaving he hands the photo of lentz and sykes to biggs
find out who this guy is
biggs hands the photo to newman
deadpan why do i get all the great jobs
kimble enters the hospital through the loading dock
roosevelt an ancient research assistant opens the door to kimble
it sure is good to see you again dr
you too roosevelt
been a long time
roosevelt closes the door behind them
roosevelt brings kimble a file marked r
this is the r
file and samples
nichols said you needed
a cop stares up at sykes house from across the street
sykes watches the cops in the car outside
he moves to the phone and dials number
i want to report a fire no its not my place its a couple doors down
kimble moves down hall and quietly enters a small research lab in the university
wahlund sits behind her microscope and doesnt see him until he touches her on the shoulder
startled oh my god
i loaned you something once kath and i need them back
sykes dressed in coat and tie prepares to leave apartment
somewhere in the distance we hear fire engine sirens
the cop stares at sykes window when suddenly we hear fire sirens and a pair of fire trucks turn onto the street and pull up across the street from the
unmarked car blocking the view of sykes house
firemen climb down and move to a nearby building
the street begins to fill up with people
the cop stares at the commotion directly behind him
he becomes so engrossed in the action like everyone else that he fails to see sykes using the distraction exit his apartment and walk calmly away from the scene
newman studies the photograph of lentz and sykes under a magnifying glass
we see the logo on lentz shirt says c m h sykes stands at a phone booth finishes a call then moves up the stairs to board an el train
a conference breaks up and nichols moves down hallway
he slows when he sees gerard and renfro waiting for him
could i have a minute
he opens the door to an empty meeting room
gerard nichols and renfro
nichols stares at a photo copy of the sykes and lentz fishing photo
hes a security specialist at devlin macgregor pharmaceuticals
kimble broke into his apartment
i dont know him
youre getting pretty desperate arent you mr
i told you you wouldnt find richard
kimble hasnt come back to you for help has he
and it seems like weve been over this ground before
now if youll excuse me
nichols moves to the door
gerard looks again at the photo then stops him
do you know the other man in the photograph
nichols stops looks at lentz and lies
i never saw him before
gerard watches him
renfro looks down and sees flyer which says nichols is slated to talk that evening in the grand ballroom
reads advances in nuclear tissue and pathology research by dr
to gerard i bet they line up to hear that one
newman and biggs enter the hospital
microscopic pov cell structure
she works the fluorescent stains
kimble helps load the next sample
half the people in the study were indigents
no follow up no baseline on them
who could say they didnt come into the study with bad livers
the one on the right is one of the samples you sent me
it shows a lot of perriportal inflammation loaded with eosinophils
when you see that with the accumulation of bile its a classic for drug induced hepatitis
now look at this
she positions a second slide
according to the study this is a slice from the same liver
kimble studies the slide
the tissue difference is markedly different clearer
clearly not from the same tissue
she yields the microscope to kimble
see this small area of bile duct proliferation
von meyenbergs complex
occurs in only of the population
but its in every one of your five samples
kimble looks up
thats statistically impossible
thats because theyre all from the same liver
she smiles at kimble
newman shows the photo to a s clerk betty
she looks at the photo
his names lentz
i only remember him because he died last summer
biggs and newman exchange a look
anybody down in pathology who might know something about the guy
betty looks at the clock its after p
its kinda late to catch anyone but you might go by the morgue
theres an old guy down there whos been around forever
sykes steps off an elevator at chicago memorial hospital
and starts down a hall
newman and biggs move down the empty hallway
this long shot has never felt longer
they find the morgue
just what i want to do before dinner
roosevelt working near the autopsy tables when the two marshals enter
are you mr
were united states marshals
were trying to find out some information about a pathologist named lentz
he used to be on staff here
roosevelt suddenly goes on the defensive
yeah we heard
we wanted to know if he knew or had any contact with dr
on the mention of kimble roosevelt becomes visibly nervous
i havent seen dr
biggs and newman exchange a look
a probe thats not what i asked sir
i just wanted to know if dr
kimble and dr
lentz knew each other
i dont know
excuse me i got to go
he moves away from the autopsy table
biggs stops him
i think youre lying to us
roosevelt looks from one marshal to the other as we as kathy packs up evidence kimble looks through the reports
theyd be home free if i hadnt been leaning on them to account for the livers i was seeing
and i wouldnt have seen the livers if i hadnt told the guys on my service to call me when they had cases that were bleeding excessively in surgery
one schmuck standing in the way
easy get rid of him and his wife
but why lentz
hes one of the original patent holders
toss the samples i sent replace them with healthy samples issue the path report on the healthy stuff piece of cake
kimble notices something in the report
when did lentz die
oh last summer sometime
kimble looks up from the protocol report
because a good third of the samples lentz approved were signed after he died
kathy comes to look at the report
lentzs signature is on reports dated october november december
someone else used lentzs name
a pathologist at devlin macgregor
they wouldnt have had the access
they would have needed someone at the hospital
kimble opens the devlin macgregor prospectus he took from the medical library and opens it to the beginning
a photo gets his attention
he takes the bag and starts for the door
where are you going
to see an old friend
gerard at his board
the cards form a triangle sykes devlin macgregor lentz with kimble at the apex
he stares at the board
poole comes to the door
kimble slips down corridor
we see someone following him
it is sykes
newman on portable phone
behind him biggs questions mr
the old guy didnt know where he was going
but he picked up some tissue samples
gerard goes to his board
renfro listens on the speakerphone
from a drug study
and signed for by dr
renfro and gerard exchange a look
nichols also knew lentz
he was a pathologist
he was covering for kimble
to renfro get cpd to bring in sykes
gerard stares at the board
kimble moves through steam tunnel beneath the hospital
it is lined with old furniture and supplies
a few moments later we see sykes following
a cordial host steps up to the microphone
the room is filled with doctors seated at tables around the room
it is the end of a dinner symposium
tonight to close our conference were honored to hear a report from one of the most respected men in his field
kimble exits the hospital and moves toward hospital e station
as the host continues his introduction of the keynote speaker we pan the dais of distinguished medical men and women
he is the a
jude robinson fellow and administrative chief of pathology at chicago memorial hospital
and just recently has been appointed member of the board of directors for devlin macgregor pharmaceuticals
and stop on charles nichols
nichols rises to applause and moves to the podium
kimble starts up the stairs to the station just as a train is coming in
kimble moves down the platform and boards the downtown train
just before the doors close sykes steps onto the last car
the train moves out
gerard stares at his board
stevens comes to the door
i checked sykes calls for the last two years against kimbles like you asked and found nothing
it was a thought
he goes back to the board but stevens isnt finished
but when i cross checked kimbles phone records
one came up
gerard looks up
kimble called sykes
to bring in sykes
night of his wifes murder seven thirty in the evening from his car
gerard stares at the deputy thinking something doesnt click
stevens sees the empty stare then gerard looks back at his board
i have the phone record right here
bring me kimbles arrest report now
to stevens no stevens
i believe you
poole enters with kimbles arrest transcript
gerard takes the transcript as renfro appears at the door
just checked sykes apartment
hes not there
as gerard looks up we sits in the front car
there are very few other riders
a man with newspaper sits across the car reading
the headlines facing kimble say kimble in chicago
kimbles booking photo stares back at him
kimble reacts to the headline looks away as the man turns the pages
the man looks over the newspaper at kimble then goes back to reading
a moment later he folds the paper back to the front page
the man looks up from the paper and looks at kimble again then down
coolly the man folds the paper tucks it under his arm stands looks through the car then moves into one of the rear cars
kimble looks out the window hoping desperately for his car to reach the station
he keeps his head turned until the man is gone
from the center of kimbles car we see the man with the newspaper move up to a transit cop
they begin talking
kimble stands coming into the shot
we see him watching the discussion
suddenly a man sitting in the rear of the car stands and blocks kimbles view of the cop
his gun is drawn
move to the door doc
transit cop moves past the man with the newspaper toward kimbles car
to radio this is transit unit
i have a possible sighting of richard kimble
northbound coming into the balbo station
request immediate back up at the station
he moves toward the connecting door to kimbles car
the train is not yet to the station
he has no escape
sykes moves toward him
this is my stop doc
kimble stares hard at sykes
he steps toward the side exit
good its my stop too
suddenly the door behind sykes opens and the transit cop enters
to sykes sir move away from him
sykes the gun tucked next to his side turns
the cop sees sykes gun reacts
but sykes fires first shoots the cop four times
as the cop falls sykes turns quickly to finish kimble
but kimble pulls the emergency brake over the door
the brakes lock
the train screeches
passengers are thrown off their feet
bags and briefcases go flying
sykes is thrown forward toward kimble who holds onto a bar for balance
the train stops just short of the station
only the first two windows of the front car are over the platform
sykes is thrown to the floor the gun slips from his grasp
kimble moves for the gun as sykes comes up catches kimble in the stomach knocks him back
the fight carries on throughout the car
kimble reaches the gun first lifts it in his left hand and aims at sykes
sykes sees the gun in kimbles hand and almost smiles
you dont have it in you
for a moment kimble almost fires but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across sykes face
then hits sykes again and again with the butt of the gun driving him down the length of the car knocking him almost unconscious
kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the transit cop
he checks for a pulse there is none
the cop is dead
kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the cops belt
he reaches for sykes wrist drags him to the cop and cuffs sykes to the dead cop
he pockets the keys and grabs sykes hair pulls his face off the floor
not as easy as helen was it
slams sykes head down leaves you missed your stop
he moves to the front of the car with sykes and the transit cops guns out
people back out of his way
he moves to where the first two windows extend over the platform kicks out the front window and
drops to the station platform
kimble lowers his head and moves down the uncrowded platform to the station

disheveled and driven he moves from the escalators to the lobby checks the list of hospitality suites and sees board which indicates nichols speech in the rooftop ballroom
he moves on to the main elevators
as he talks we move to
listening the same men we saw in the hospitality suite when nichols talked to kimble

kimble rides alone to the rooftop ballroom
gerards car pulls up in front of the hotel
police are controlling pedestrians

cops deploying to points of entry
security guards keying shut parking garage and blocking stairwells
b helicopter with police sharpshooters takes off from meigs field downtown and heads for the hotel

a man tries to stop him at the doors kimble simply moves him out of the way and opens the doors to nichols moves to the last of his speech
as kimble enters at the rear and i especially would like to thank my researchers who helped me
nichols stops his speech stunned to see kimble
whats wrong charlie
kimble begins moving down the aisle past the tables of doctors toward the podium
we see the faces of kimbles colleagues and friends from the ballroom sequence earlier
at first no one notices kimble but as he makes his way toward the dais the applause fades and then room quiets
whispers of its richard
kimble continues to the front talking to nichols as if the room were empty
after lentz died you were the only one that had access to the pathology reports
nichols remains calm
what are you
you switched the samples and falsified the reports so r
could get approval
richard i dont know what youre talking about

nichols stares at kimble and for the first time we see a flicker of concern
you almost pulled it off charlie
but i know all about it now and i can prove it
nichols and kimble hold a look
nichols turns to the audience
ladies and gentlemen
my friend as you can see is obviously not well

kimble tracks along with him moving through the tables passing the table with the devlin macgregor board of directors
they are disturbed by this situation

the rest follow gerard to the rooftop elevators
roaring over chicago skyline
the bright red sign of the hilton hotel looms ahead
nichols moves down hallway and turns into a hospitality suite
a moment later kimble follow and enters the
and is immediately smashed with a chair by nichols
kimble goes flying stunned
nichols locks the door
your best quality richard is that you dont give up nichols pulls kimble to his feet
even when its clearly in your best interest to
he hits him again drives him back into the library
kimble tries to recover as nichols relentlessly stays on him
he pulls him up slams him against the fire escape doors
i always knew that id have to kill you
he drives a blow into kimbles stomach
now i must thank you for giving me witnesses tonight who will support me
when i tell them it was self defense
he shoves kimble through the door out into
and almost over the railing
kimble grabs the rail to keep from dropping to the street
nichols closes on him but kimble rolls away at the last minute and knocks nichols back against the other side of fire escape
you missed your chance charlie
nichols charges kimble but kimble drives him back with two crushing blows that send nichols down the stairs
kimble moves down the stairs after him passing under a security camera
a room lined with security monitors
two security personnel sit in front of their console
newman stands behind them
on screen we see kimble moving down the stairs toward nichols who pulls himself to his feet
newman stands in front of the screen talks to his radio
to radio ive got kimble on the roof with nichols
gerard and deputies poole biggs and renfro around him
to radio keep and eye on him
biggs has roof plans
there are four exits to the roof

nichols rises to his feet swings but kimble blocks the blow and lands another that sends nichols down another set of stairs to the roof
you took everything away from me
gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor
the elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented doctors trying to escape
the marshals wade through meet up with two hotel security guards
kimble pulls nichols to his feet
they are silhouetted by the lights of the city skyline
i want to know charlie
was it worth it
this thing is bigger than even you think richard
you cant stop it
he hits nichols again with tremendous force knocking him against the parapet
nichols stares over the edge the street appears far below
gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom
the deputies move to separate areas
several doctors point them in the direction kimble and nichols fled
newman stands in front the security monitors and watches kimble and nichols on the roof
kimble reaches nichols and draws to hit him again as the helicopter suddenly roars over the rooftop
its beam hits the two men and a voice booms from the helicopter chicago police
in the instant of shock nichols knees kimble and bolts
gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the hospitality suite
to doctors clear the hallway
to security get that door open
the door opens and gerard moves quickly through the hospitality suite for the rooftop
to security stay at this door
he moves through the door to the roof alone
newman watching the security monitors sees kimble and nichols
on another monitor we see gerard exit the suite
kimble recovers sees gerard moving down the fire escape toward him and nichols escaping
he goes after nichols
the helicopter circles back over the roof illuminating the rooftop in its million candle power beam
ive got a visual on kimble
kelly listens on his ratio
bring him down
kimble chases nichols down the roof as bullets from the helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to kimble
the helicopter swings out to keep kimble in sight
gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows
to radio this is a united states marshal
get that helicopter out of here
he moves away among the duct work
gerard continues after kimble
the helicopter circles and follows from above
renfro triggers his radio
there is a u
marshal out there
hold your fire
its beam tracking kimble across the rooftop
he moves through the blowers and duct work
kimble is gaining ground on nichols
he is about to fire when he hears through his radio
hold your fire
the shooter pulls back
gerard rushes across the roof toward kimble
he is almost to the end of the roof when kimble tackles him
the two men crash against sloped glass roof of an elevator housing
inside the shaft an elevator moves toward the roof
it stops on the floor ten feet below the roof
through the glass roof we see the doors open
charges toward who slams nichols hard against the glass
the wired glass cracks and bellies with the form of their bodies
nichols head rocks from the impact
the glass groans
the wire stresses
the caulking begins to drop
nichols struggles but kimble has him in control
slams him down hard again
circles illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and gerard closing
the elevator doors close and the car beneath the skylight begins to descend
kimble slams nichols one more time against the glass and the wire holding the glass gives way sending kimble and nichols into
kimble and nichols locked together fall down the shaft and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car
nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car
kimble hits and slides across the roof to the edge stopping himself just before he falls into the shaft
an elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness
gerard reaches the elevator housing looks down into the shaft
kimbles car disappears into the darkness
nichols pulls himself to his feet
hits the emergency stop and the doors open
he disappears into
a huge industrial laundry room
steam rises from the giant machines
kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves carefully into the laundry
like an industrial jungle
dimly lit filled with deafening machinery
five hundred pound bags of laundry move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty foot long washers
at the other end of the washers hydraulic presses stamp out three foot diameter cakes which are moved by conveyor and dollies to automated dryers
the noise is deafening
gerard comes down back stairwell
followed by renfro
to radio where did the elevator stop
newman checks the computer board for the elevator position
to radio level five
nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an exit tries the door
it is secured with a collapsible grating with a padlock
he looks up keeps moving
notices the swinging bags follows nichols trail
he stops to get his bearings sees shadow at the far end of the room between the two washers
kimble closes in moving between the large conveyors
gerard enters sorting room with renfro
he sees two sorters standing by a small conveyor as he enters
get out of here
he and renfro move around the corner where a laundry worker is hooking a lb bag of lines onto the overhead rail
a hydraulic lift operated by a hanging on off switch raises the bag on a yellow steel i beam
the worker takes one look at gerard and abandons his station
gerard biggs and renfro move to the closed doors of the main room
to renfro were going in
give me five minutes
he draws his glock opens the door and enters the main room
he moves to end of washers using the machines as cover
he sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the dryer as a weapon turns the corner and is about to belt him when he realizes its not nichols
but a laundry worker
kimble moves away from the terrified man when he hears a voice from the other end of the laundry
above the din kimble
kimble reacts to gerards voice moves away
moving behind machinery sees light at far end of the room where gerard enters
the door closes automatically behind gerard and renfro
they enter the noisy main room and separate
renfro moves up the far side of the room gerard up the center
both move slowly through the maze of bags carts automated equipment
there is no way out of here
the building is locked down
moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts
i know about nichols
i know about sykes
nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called sykes from it
separated from gerard
he hears a noise behind him a bag comes down the track at break neck speed renfro spins dodges it gets his bearings and continues
he watches the movement of bags as he did with nichols
moving through the forest of massive bags
thats why there was no forced entry at your house
hed used your keys
realizing what gerard knows
considering his next move
he realizes gerard now knows hes the killer
he moves behind the water softener tanks and chemicals and spots renfro and something else the hanging control for the i beam
another bag comes down the track
he dodges it and steps into an open track
from here he can see straight back toward the washers
come meet me out here
he steps out and then back as a bag shoots by
he ducks under the bag into the next track and suddenly hears a whirring sound behind him
renfro turns as an i beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor opening a gash across the side of his head
he lays still
steps out of the shadows turns him over exposing his empty shoulder harness and takes the gun from renfros hand
nichols moves toward gerard with the gun
oblivious to this action moves on passes the conveyor belts
he makes one last appeal
its time to quit running
if you dont you know ill stop you
he listens there is no answer
starts to move out to meet gerard sees renfro down
his shoulder harness is empty
he knows nichols is armed
moves into the alley between the two giant washers
he pauses looks back then continues when he turns his back on us
steps into frame behind him and slowly takes aim
just before he fires however he hears
nichols turns toward the voice as kimble swings the stick and clocks him sending the gun skittering on the floor behind gerard
turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on kimble with nichols at his feet unconscious
he realizes instantly that kimble saved his life and lowers his gun
kimble exhausted leans against the washer
they hold a look as deputies and police flood into the room surrounding kimble and handcuffing him
chicago police hold back crowds of onlookers on michigan avenue
police cars and vans television news trucks vie for space in front of the hilton towers
charles nichols on a stretcher loaded into an ambulance
the doors close
reporters and television cameramen line the sidewalk giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom
we pick up pieces of their reports as we move past them toward the entrance
as we reported a few minutes ago the saga of once prominent chicago surgeon dr
richard kimble who escaped from an illinois corrections bus took a strange twist this evening when dr
kimble was captured at the chicago hilton
another reporter continues there are unconfirmed reports from police of new evidence which may exonerate kimble while implicating some of the biggest names in medicine
the doors to the police van close amid a flurry of photographs
a third reporter interviews a stunned doctor from the ballroom he just walked in
we didnt know what he was going to do
my wife was very frightened
the next thing i knew cops were charging in and
kimble in handcuffs is escorted by biggs newman poole and gerard out of the hotel into the waiting chaos
renfro his head bandaged is helped by paramedics
as soon as the group exits the hotel
television lights flood the scene
kimble lowers his head
reporters crowd forward yelling questions
kimble is it true you can prove your innocence
gerard wants the crowd controlled
to police get them back
the marshals ant cops clear a line for kimble to get into a waiting car away from the media
biggs opens the back door and helps kimble inside
watch your head dr
newman climbs in behind the wheel
gerard in the back next to kimble
he leans out the window and motions to poole
to poole poole you got that thing
to kimble give me your hands
kimble pauses then holds up his wrists and gerard unlocks kimbles handcuffs
poole hands an ice pack over the seat
gerard places the pack on kimble bruised and battered hands
take care of those hands doc youre going to need them again soon
i thought you told me you didnt care
yeah well dont spread it around
they share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away
the car carrying kimble pulls onto michigan avenue heading back downtown
as we pull back we see kimbles car at first alone on the great avenue then gradually joined by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the traffic movement and
lights of the city
