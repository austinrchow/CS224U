buff oceans rev
we hear a door open and close followed by approaching footsteps
danny ocean dressed in prison fatigues enters frame and sits
please state your name for the record
ocean the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether if released you are likely to break the law again
while this was your first conviction you have been implicated though never charged in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds
what can you tell us about this
as you say maam i was never charged
three parole board members sit opposite danny behind a table
ocean what were trying to find out is was there a reason you chose to commit this crime or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time
my wife left me
i was upset
i got into a self destructive pattern
if released is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern
she already left me once
i dont think shell do it again just for kicks
glances dart between the board members
ocean what do you think you would do if released
deadpan i dont know
how much do you guys make a year
danny steps forth and guard doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to danny
adding a piece of mail to the pile this came today for you
restll be forwarded to your parole officer
reading its return address over dannys shoulder those your lawyers
he opens the letter and as his eyes gaze over the papers within he smirks just a little
whats it say
im a free man
danny pulls on civilian clothes and theres not a bare thread among them
he tugs his cuffs and smiles the old skin feels good
one last item to don a silver wedding band
danny considers it
will he put it on
a sign reads new jersey state minimum security correctional facility
someone has graffitied below it if you were in prison youd be home now
the great metal door opens and danny stands within its frame ready for release
if it matters and if you notice hes wearing his wedding ring
he hovers there for a moment on the precipice of freedom
the wind whistles a little on the other side of the gate and the view ahead is not pleasant new jersey life is hard out there
but danny musters his courage then takes his first step into free america
any empty wintery boardwalk
and his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting
as we pull up to dannys face and spin around him we hear then see the buzz of a casino floor the hum of conversation the ding ding ding and
thunk thunk thunk from the slots the brisk whir of shuffled cards
and to danny its a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy
as he pulls out several crisp one hundreds sets them on green felt then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips
danny cranes his neck about the casino looking for someone a friend somebody who should be here but without success
he turns his attention back to his cards and the cards of the dealer
dealer shows a six
danny wins again
a second dealer relieves the first and danny recognizes him with a smile this wasnt the friend he was scouting for but two hours out of the joint any familiar
face is welcome
the new dealer frank catton glances up at danny and his eyes go wide like a priest whos discovered hes dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself
he quickly hides his astonishment
i beg your pardon sir
you must have me confused with someone else
my name is ramon
he taps the name embroidered on his vest although he is the most african looking ramon youve ever seen
a pit boss circles close by and glares at them both
collecting his chips doubled tables cold anyway
you might try the lounge at the grand sir
it gets busy around one
as he goes thanks
danny checks his watch then the lounge around him prison had more nightlife
he nurses a bourbon folds back the new york times and scans
his eyes move down the page and stop at a header vegas paradiso to be razed former owner denounces plans accompanied by two photographs
the first tan well coiffed developer and new owner of the paradiso terry benedict with a beautiful if barely visible woman on his arm
the second scowling former owner reuben tishkoff
catching up on current events
danny lowers the paper frank is sitting across from him changed out of his dealers threads
glad to meet you
frank catton wouldnt get by the gaming board
beat you just out
re dannys drink and whereabouts and already turning over a new leaf
frank signals a passing waitress she ignores him
directly this is why hes here you seen him
last i heard he was in l
teaching movie stars how to play cards
you dont have something planned already
i just became a citizen again
frank stares at danny a moment finally catches his eye and danny cant help but grin of course he has
frank turns his eyes to heaven
moving with danny and frank
its tough now our line of work
everybody so serious
too many guns too many computers
whadda you gonna do
steal from ordinary people

so whats left
banks got no money
its all electronic
only place that still takes cash is
realizing oh no
danny has his answer
danny pulls a business card from his jacket picks up the phone again and dials the cards number
yes officer brooks
my name is danny ocean
im just out im supposed to check in with you within twenty four hours
listens no sir i havent gotten into any trouble
no drinking no sir
listens finishes his bourbon no sir i wouldnt even think of leaving the state
off the sound of a jet fly over we
pulling off the capitol building we pick up rusty tall angular ebony leaning against his ford falcon
rusty turns to the voice and moving with him and topher grace the actor as they push down a back alley
hey i dont know if youre uh you know incorporated or anything like rusty ryan
and i dont know incorporated but you should think about it really cause i was talking to my manager yesterday bernie
no not bernie i mean not not that bernie my business manager hes also bernie he was telling me that since this what we do could be considered research for
you know a future gig that i should be able to write it off as a business expense
so he suggested that itd be better if i wrote you a check and thereby rusty looks at him are you stoned
or or we could keep it cash
by this time they should have entered where they must weave through hordes of young hollywood nightclubbers
josh is here
seth is here
david couldnt make it
hes got two weeks of reshoots on lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from germany
thats a problem
barry is here
i thought they let him out to do that h
thing in vancouver
couldnt work the dates
oh and he brought his girlfriend
not the one from uh huh
beat i quit watching when kate left don after his accident
they pass on and into small but stylish
rusty enters topher in tow
good evening guys
lets play some cards
a glance at the table reveals the three waiting players are all young tv stars josh jackson seth green barry watson here for a group poker lesson with rusty
one star indeed has brought his girlfriend katie also a known actress to observe
a glance back at rusty reveals hes in for a long night
and lets play some cards
the group lesson has begun
a hundred bucks to me
mulling it over ah what the hell
rusty leans into tophers ear whispering oceans rev
why you bet a certain way is your business
but you have to make them think youre betting for a reason
to another player seth
you know what you have
looking at them doesnt change them
leave em where they are and make your bet
to another player youre showing
yeah i know shes your girlfriend barry but you cant
to another josh
deal to your left
a waitress enters from the club and dance music with her
as she distributes a fresh round one mccallum neat
and four bottled waters
rusty takes in the sight bottled fucking water on a poker table
triumphantly two pair nines and twos
rusty checks his hand a full house full of face cards
folding you got me
as seth rakes in his winnings lets take a little break
at the bar rusty orders a double
he needs it
shouting over music hows the game going
its been the longest hour of my life
at the same volume im running away with your wife
the bartender not able to hear him smiles and flashes a thumbs up before moving away
behind the bar two go go dancers writhe behind red light district windows and rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection
then out the corner of his eye he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd
someone familiar to him
hey rusty we got another player if thats alright
topher indicates the new arrival danny
rusty looks as if theres a bad smell in the room
the bouncer mentioned there was a game in progress
i hope im not intruding
no intrusion at all what was his name the bouncers
i dont remember
a card player with amnesia
this should be fun
rusty deals the next hand
what do you do for a living mr
if you dont mind my asking
why should i mind
two cards please
long beat i just got out of prison
a glance among the other players really
half to divert attention barry youre showing again
whatd you uh go to prison for
i stole things
what like jewels
a beat then incan matrimonial headmasks
looks are exchanged
everyone digests that
from a museum
there a lot of money in those
dont let him fool you seth
if you can move the things
finishing his deal one card to me
to danny pointedly but you cant
my fence seemed confident enough
if youre dealing with cash you dont need a fence
some people just lack vision
probably everybody in cell block e
now the other players realize
these guys have a relationship
in fact a criminal one
and judging from their steely glares across the table not a happy one
well thats all behind us now
i should hope so
danny smiles icily of course its not then pulls out his wallet
i raise you five hundred dollars
a hush in the room
danny has thrown down the gauntlet
he and rusty hold each others stares
guys day one whats the first rule of poker
um never bet on uh on leave emotion at the a door
my friend here just raised me out of pique
beat todays lesson
how to draw out a bluff
this early in the game that much money im thinking hes holding nothing better than a pair of face cards
beat seth raise him
uh your five hundred and
rusty nods and seth pushes in his chips
seven to me
what the hell
but be careful you dont push him too high too fast
want to keep him on the leash
its joshs turn
whats that to me
all you have to do is call
off joshs further hesitation what
your girlfriend holding your purse
that does it
josh is in
the bets to danny
he checks his hand and seth starts to whisper to topher
contrary to what mr
ryan may say seth i always check my cards before i make a bet
but be cafeful
i could tell from your face youre holding three of a kind or better
digging his wallet out five hundred to call
and two grand more
danny stares rusty down
the others look a little pale
guys youre free to do what you like
its a lot of money
but im staying in
hes trying to buy his way out of his bluff
nobody looks too eager to call but nobody wants to leave a grand on the table either
finally seth ponies up and the others not be outdone do too
danny sets down his hand
its a winner
the others jaws dropped throw in their cards
for the first time tonight rusty blanches
i i was sure he was bluffing
as rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him danny rakes in his pot
thanks for the game fellas
then hey i hate to ask this but could you sign something for me
its for the guys in the joint
they just love all your shows
a queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as topher and company exit and they begin signing autographs
danny and rusty exit too but of course nobody gives a shit about them
danny and rusty ride silently staring out opposite windows at sunset boulevard
that was that was just
how was the clink
you get the cookies i sent you
why do you think i came to see you first
danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket peels off half and hands it to rusty
half of its yours
you barge into my new workplace ruin my professional reputation least you could do is tell me youve got something better for me
ive got something better for you
theyre sitting in a booth over coffee
danny stares at him next subject please
no ones ever done it before
needs planning a large crew
not loaded ones
it has to be very precise
theres a lot of security
but the take
whats the target
eight figures each
deep breath then whens the last time you were in vegas
you wanna knock over a casino
danny puts down his coffee
and shakes his head
and lifts three fingers three casinos
rusty must put down his coffee too
its after hours downtown
dark empty dead
lights out on the th
engraved brass announces j
two flashlight beams strafe wood paneled elegant offices danny and rusty on late night reconnaissance
as danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints rusty passes the time switching papers from a desks in box to its out box
at last danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk we however never see it
the vault at the bellagio
a beat as rusty scans the document then another underneath it
if im reading these right and i think that i am this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed
actually you know what im wrong
its definitely the least accessible vault ever designed
rustys brow furrows just a little
you said three casinos
flips to next blueprint these feed into the cages at both the mirage and the m
tapping vault but every dime ends up here
the bellagio mirage and
these are terry benedicts places
yes they are
think hell mind
more than somewhat
the elevator just arrives
its doors part to reveal a security guard within here to make his tour a large fellow he has to duck to exit
as danny rolls up the set of blueprints rusty considers the plan which in our absence danny has pitched him
youd need at least a dozen guys doing a combination of cons
like what you think
well off the top of my head id say youre looking at a boesky a jim brown a miss daisy two jethros and a leon spinks
oh and the biggest ella fitzgerald ever
beat where do you think youre gonna get the money to back this
as long as were hitting these three casinos well get our bankroll
terry benedict has a list of enemies
but does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose
smiles realizing aha
smiles too aha
as he approaches dannys and rustys voices
so heres what i think you should take this plan kick it around for a week or two
sleep on it
turn it over in your head
then never bring it up to me again
so what are you saying
im saying this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat
i thought it was much harder than that suddenly the security guards flashlight beam hits them square in the eyes
danny and rusty put their hands up to block the light
jesus oscar lower it a little will ya
lowers beam you two done up here
find what you wanted
you mind if we borrow a couple drawings for the night
make some copies
whatever you need
danny withdraws his money clip peels off a couple hundreds and buries them in the security guards hand
danny and rusty wait for an elevator
when its doors open rusty stops danny from boarding
i need a reason
and dont say money
beat why do this
why not do it
rusty stares at him enough bullshitting around
because yesterday i walked out of the joint wearing my entire wardrobe and youre colddecking teenbeat coverboys
beat because the house always wins
you play long enough never changing stakes the house takes you
unless when that special hand comes around you bet big
and then you take the house
youre been practicing that speech havent you
did i rush it
it felt like i rushed it
no it was good
they step aboard the elevator
as the door closes i wonder what reuben will say
danny and rusty look at each other
youre out of your goddamn minds
reuben tishkoff the grimace of a man in mid movement forever cemented on his face scrutinizes his two lunch guests danny and rusty at his poolside
are you listening to me
you are both of you nuts
i know more about casino security than any man alive
i invented it and it cannot be beaten
they got cameras they got watchers they got locks they got timers they got vaults
they got enough armed personnel to occupy paris
okay bad example
its never been tried
oh its been tried
a few guys even came close
you know the three most successful robberies in vegas history
an adlai stevenson lookalike approaches a lockbox carrier from behind and snatches the box
he takes almost three steps before five security men leap at him and freeze frame on his wide eyed expression of horror
the bronze medal
pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the sands
he got two steps closer to the door than any living soul before him
resume action adlai stevenson gets a taste of what nfl quarterbacks experience every sunday
a hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors clutching a tray full of chips and as the doors begin to part for him freeze frame a billy club appears out
second most successful robbery
this guy actually smelled fresh oxygen before they got him
resume action the billy club comes down whap
across the hippies skull and its chicago all over again
course he was breathing out of a hose the next three weeks goddamn hippie
and the closest any man has gotten to robbing a las vegas casino
tourists and valets scatter as a euro thief pastel t shirt beneath a white linen suit bursts from the casino and takes five steps before freeze frame glass explodes from
three different doors behind him and he arches his back in agony
outside of caesars in
he came he grabbed he got conquered
resume action bullets rip the man to shreds and he collapses on caesars steps a bloody pulp
but what am i saying
you guys are pros the best
im sure you can make it out of the casino
of course lest we forget once youre out the front door youre still in the middle of the fucking desert
both danny and rusty look chastened
to danny hes right
reuben youre right
our eyes are bigger than our stomachs
thats exactly it
yeah yeah blah blah
thank you so much for setting us straight
sorry we bothered you
they both rise to go
look we all go way back
i owe you from that thing with the guy in the place and ill never forget it
it was our pleasure
id never been to belize
give dominic your addresses i got some remaindered furniture i wanna send you
danny and rusty begin to circle the pool to leave
tishkoff of course wont let them go that easily
just out of curiosity which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob
danny stops almost as if hes been waiting for this question which of course he has
the bellagio mirage and the m
nostrils flared smelling a rat those are terry benedicts casinos
say you know hes right
tishkoff waves them back sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail
whadda you got against terry benedict
what do you have against him
thats the real question
he torpedoed my casino muscled me out now hes gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin eyesore
dont think i dont see what youre doin
what are we doing reuben
you gonna steal from terry benedict you better goddamn know
this sorta thing used to be civilized
youd hit a guy hed whack you
bristles at the end of this he better not know youre involved not know your names or think youre dead
because hell kill you and then hell go to work on you
thats why weve got to be very careful
we have to be precise
we have to be well funded
yeah you gotta be nuts too
and youre gonna need a crew as nuts as you are
pregnant silence who do you have in mind
danny and rusty both smile theyve hooked their fish
and so it begins
frank catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief
across a desk his boss fills out paperwork
has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates
frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay
he stops to light a cigarette inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner welcome to las vegas
what about drivers
close on a souped up tractor wheeled monster truck its engine roaring before a starting line itching to cross it
now take a step back
that souped up monster truck stands a foot and a half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper
its a remote controlled toy
the roaring engine comes from the vehicle next to it an actual monster truck
both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away
this is a race
the drivers stare each other down turk behind the wheel of the truck and virgil track side remote control in hand malloy
theyre nice boys
peckerwoods sure but nice
i talked to the malloys yesterday
the mormon twins
theyre both in salt lake city six months off the job
i got the sense theyre having trouble filling the hours
lights flash red to yellow to green and while the truck coats rubber on the track virgils toy zips to a lead
its looking to be an embarrassment for turk until he jerks his wheel a little and ka thunk flattens his brothers vehicle
virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry
on a black and white monitor two mobsters on a meet in a public park peer over their shoulders making certain no one is watching them
little do they know
livingston dell audio visual junkie and victim of a continual flop sweat crouches before their image masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand
he is flanked by fbi men
livingstons been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the f
how are his nerves
beat not so bad youd notice
as a fbi man reaches to adjust a monitor
d dont dont dont
do you see me pulling the gun out of your holster and firing it
hey radio shack relax
livingston walks down the boardwalk
a rollerblader with a dog on a leash approaches and livingston gets caught between the two
as he struggles to untangle himself from the leash
with a view of livingston on the boardwalk
danny and rusty wait for him over espressos
next item on his list munitions
on the job
you send flowers
dated his wife a while
onto next candidate basher
checks his watch we may be too late
the explosives expert
a pair of goggles over his eyes reflects a match being struck then touched to a fuse
wood shards and splinters of glass fly all around basher merely ducks his head and whistles
as the dust settles three men move quickly past basher and into what the settling fog now reveals to be a dynamited bank vault
alarms begin to sound this is bad news
to the rest of his gang his temper flaring you know you guys had one job to do
the men exit through the front doors their hands over their heads basher trailing them
policemen and swat members encircle the group weapons trained on them chock full of instructions
basher sits in the rear handcuffed behind his back feet on the pavement
an explosives cop kneels in front of him
and thats all you used during the event
are you accusing me of booby trapping
well how bout it
booby traps arent mr
the cop turns standing behind him stone faced is rusty in a dark suit and shades
isnt that right basher
flashing badge briefly peck a
let me venture a guess
a simple g mainliner double coil backwound quick fuse with a drag under feet
off cops reaction thats our man
tell me something else
have you checked him for booby traps on his person
i mean really checked not just for weapons
the cop looks bewildered
rusty steps forward yanks basher onto his feet spins him around
he moves his hands up and down bashers legs around his waist under his arms
will you go find griggs and tell him i need to see him
loud just go find him will you
as cop stalks off under his breath how fast can you put something together with what i passed you
thirty seconds all right
as we hear something snap from behind his back now
theyre hurrying ahead of them is a wall of squad cars a police cordon and a crowd of onlookers
is danny here
around the corner
be good working with professionals again
beat okay go
and they both start running
theres a bomb in the
and behind them the squad car erupts with a bang
a collective scream rises from the crowd everyone ducks cops hit the ground and cover their heads
rusty and basher move briskly past them dodging their splayed legs like tires on an obstacle course
by the time the explosives cop thinks to look around for basher theyve both disappeared
the chinese national circus currently on tour in the western united states
trapeze artists gymnastic teams and trampoline daredevils fly somersault spin and swing through the air
a full house applauds every feat
danny and rusty sit in the bleachers surrounded by parents and kids munching on spindles of cotton candy
tough guys in toyland
in chinese then english ladies and gentlemen the amazing yen
a funambulist yen begins his high wire act
so he can walk on a rope
more than that
so he can juggle
we need a grease man not an acrobat
who else is on the list
he is the list
halfway across the wire the funambulist sits
and very slowly but without hesitation he contorts himself into a ball never losing his balance
even danny is impressed
theres your grease man
danny and rusty exit the circus tent head for their car
we need saul
he wont come
he swore off the game a year ago
he get religion
you can ask him
rusty stops stares at danny sighs
i can ask
saul bloom s befuddled wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffers hat counts out money through the window lists his bets
he checks his tickets plunges them into his pants pocket and moves off
rusty appears in the f
behind a pillar as dapper as saul is down at heel watching him go
when saul disappears into the tunnel he moves
saul sits on one of the long general admission steps under the box seats
he produces an orange from his pocket starts to peel it
a pair of well shined shoes appears behind him
saul senses their presence but doesnt turn around
i saw you in the paddock before the second race outside the mens room when i placed my bet
i saw you before you even got up this morning
how ya been saul
whats with the orange
my doctor says i need vitamins
so why dont you take vitamins
for the first time saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at rusty

i got a box seat
a waiter serves coffee to rusty and saul
i thought you drank bloody marys at the track saul
a man shouldnt drink on the job

he breaks late
everyone knows this
on the track the dogs are now coming around the back stretch and the crowd on the bleachers rises cheering
you gonna treat me like a grownup at least
tell me what the scam is
under the noise rusty leans in and whispers in sauls ear
sauls eyes widen then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting
rusty places an envelope in sauls lap then gets up and walks out as on the track the dog crosses the finish line
last by several lengths
saul considers his options
in one hand a fan of losing tickets
in the other courtesy of rusty a ticket to las vegas
and saul makes ten
danny and rusty look weary from all this recruitment
a nearby tv with the sound off plays a promo for an upcoming tyson fight
ten should do it dont you think
as rusty shrugs you think we need one more
as rusty shrugs you think we need one more
as rusty shrugs okay
well get one more
native chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth sense l car balance as the train bends and shakes at a corner
one passenger in particular keeps his footing a young man in a frayed jacket linus
two overgroomed stockbrokers stand with their backs to the young man yammering about high interest yields and consequently they dont notice and neither do we not at first that linus
is slowly picking one of their pockets
the thievery is glacier paced linus his face always forward and inscrutable gingerly raises one tail of his targets brooks brothers jacket and then with incomparable dexterity unbuttons his wallet
pocket with a flick of his thumb and forefinger
from halfway down the train car nothing appears amiss and no passenger looks the wiser
or so it seems
a copy of the chicago sun times opened and upheld lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at linus
it is danny smirk on his lips he and he alone is aware of the ongoing heist
back to linus his spoils a gucci wallet now in sight but he waits for just the right moment and then when the train hits another curve
he stumbles forward his left hand finding support on the stockbrokers shoulder as his right relieves the man of his wallet
sorry bout that
no problem guy
the stockbroker resumes his yacketing oblivious as linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket face betraying nothing
only danny appreciates the artistry performed here today
he folds the sun times under his arm as
the subway squeals to a stop
linus jumps out leaving his prey aboard and a few moments later danny steps off too
the hurly burly of rush hour in union station
commuters zig and zag this way and that all on furious schedules and linus slips blithely through them in no hurry a man whos pulled this job a thousand times
he dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters and except for a brief brush with one well dressed man the sun times tucked under his arm he escapes the station without incident
linus exits casually reaching into his jacket to count his winnings
and his face falls
all he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a calling card
on one side in engraved printing daniel ocean
on the flip side in handwriting nice pull
murphys bar rush division
on a tabletop the gucci wallet beside a half drunk guinness
linus enters the front door cases the joint spots the wallet on the table and danny behind it
who are you
a friend of bobby caldwells
linus balks prideful but sense finds a way and he sits
bobby told me about you
said you were the best set of hands he ever saw
didnt expect to find you working wallets on the subway
that wasnt work that was practice
danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on the table
he keeps his hand over it
youre either in or out right now
what is it
a plane ticket
a job offer
youre pretty trusting pretty fast
bobby has every faith in you
fathers are like that
off dannys reaction he didnt tell you
as danny shakes his head he doesnt like me trading on his name
you do this job hell be trading on yours
what if i say no
well get someone else who wont be quite as good
you can go back to feeling up stockbrokers
he looks down at the ticket then at the wallet
its one or the other
a waitress passes and danny signals her for his bill
when his attention returns to linus the wallet remains
but the ticket beneath his hand is gone
linus is reading it
thats the best lift ive seen you make yet
las vegas huh
and our main theme kicks in as we
the city looms out of the desert like an infernal machine lights flashing skyline pulsing a neon fortress
one thing in particular catches our eye an enormous billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match between mike tyson and lennox lewis
below it a promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call girls
frank catton is already here mixing a drink when ding dong the doorbell chimes
tishkoff shuffles toward the front hes given the help the night off and opens his door to find
trick or treat
livingston basher yen the malloys saul and linus crowding his doormat
a taxi van pulls away behind them
what you guys get a group rate or something
along one wall a buffet table has been set up and while virgil and turk pile shrimp onto plates saul pockets an orange for later
you make it out to utah much saul
last man youd see in the tabernacle not as much as id like
youd like it
youd like provo
scarfing a jumbo shrimp anybody see the salsa goes with this
at the wet bar basher mixes a drink for livingston on a couch yen balances coffee table ornaments into a skyscraper to franks astonishment
in a corner off on his own linus watches the company his eyes narrowing wary
gentlemen welcome to las vegas
danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the room flanked by rusty and tishkoff
he starts down
most of you know each other already
you probably havent met linus caldwell before hes bobbys kid outta chicago
linus trades nods around the room
before we start nobodys on the line here yet
what im about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous
if that doesnt sound like your particular brand of vodka help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey
no hard feelings
pauses soberly otherwise come with me
he turns and walks out of the living room into another
rusty is close behind he turns briefly casts an eye over the assembled and keeps going
the guys look each other over sizing things up
what the hell
and he follows along with frank and livingston
then virgil turk and yen
that leaves linus watching the line of men disappear
he turns to find tishkoff by his side staring at him
youre bobby caldwells kid huh
its nice there
you like it
get in the goddamn room
a tournament level pool table holds center stage here
atop its green felt sits a raised elaborate miniature of terry benedicts las vegas three casinos and hotels with the strip running between them
as the eleven surround the table and the model
gentlemen the block of las vegas boulevard
otherwise known as the bellagio the mirage the m
together theyre the three most profitable casinos in las vegas
danny removes the strip from the model
revealed beneath is a complex substructure featuring three tunnels each leading from a casino to a single freight sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault
gentlemen the bellagio vault
located below the strip beneath two hundred feet of solid earth
it safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it
beat and were going to rob it
everyone takes a breath awed
smash and grab job huh
its a little more complicated than that
danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of tvs
courtesy of frank catton new blackjack dealer at the bellagio security tapes from the three casinos
on the monitors three montages of black and white security tapes starting within the three casinos cages moving into the tunnels then as the tvs unite in their images pushing
into the elevator and eventually the vault
as the groups glances shoot back and forth from the tv to the corresponding section of the model i
from a pov of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself
bad news first
this place houses a security system which rivals most nuclear missile silos
first we have to get within the casino cages indicating here here and here which anyone knows takes more than a smile
next through these doors each of which requires a different six digit code changed every twelve hours
past those lies the elevator and this is where it gets tricky the elevator wont move without authorized fingerprint identifications which we cant fake and vocal confirmations from both the
security center within the bellagio and the vault below which we wont get
furthermore the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors meaning if we manually override the lift the shafts exit will lock down automatically and well be trapped
once weve gotten down the shaft though then its a walk in the park just three more guards with uzis and predilections toward not being robbed and the most elaborate
vault door conceived by man
for a moment each man keeps his two dozen questions or more to himself
at last one speaks up
the amazing yen
of course no one understands him
in response no
tunneling is out
there are richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction
if a groundhog tried to nest there theyd know about it
either the guys are too dumbfounded by that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead of them to speak
you said something about good news
smiles happy someone asked the nevada gaming commission stipulates a casino must hold in reserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor
as i mentioned this vault services each of the three casinos above it
that means during the week by law it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin
on a weekend between eighty and ninety million
on a fight night like the one two weeks from tonight the night were going to rob it at least a hundred and fifty million
without breaking a sweat
gazing about room now there are eleven of us
each with an equal share
you do the math
moving around the table on ten faces as everyone does precisely that in their heads except for virgil who does it on his fingers
thats what i said
everyone seems suitably impressed by their share
i have a question
as danny turns to him say we do get into the cage and through the security doors there and down the elevator we cant move and past the guards with
guns and into the vault we cant open
without being seen by the cameras
off everyones astonishment oh right
i forgot to mention that
say we do all that
were just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped
danny smiles his broad sure of himself grin the one rusty couldnt deny earlier and these guys wont deny now
saul looks panic stricken like that his ulcer has flared up and he pops a rolaid in his mouth
heres how well begin
moving with a cash cart as security guards push it past tourists past cocktail waitresses past linus sitting at a blackjack table
first task reconnaissance
i want to know everything thats going on in all three casinos
from the rotation of the dealers to the path of every cash cart
two security technicians on a smoke break grumble about their sex lives
across the room frank sits innocently doing a crossword
i wanna know everything about every guard every watcher anyone with a security pass
i wanna know where theyre from what their nicknames are how they take their coffee
reveals on his crossword frank has scribbled a transcript of the technicians conversation
as he glances up at an electronic keycard clipped to one technicians belt
an identical keycard is swiped through a keypad its light flashing red to green admitting a guard into an employees only doorway
the malloys whove shadowed the guard here note a sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security camera embedded in the ceiling above no one walks through
that portal unchecked
most of all i want you guys to know these casinos
they were built as labyrinths to keep people in
i want you guys to know the quick routes out
their job done the malloys start toward the casinos exit
in different directions
they begin to argue the exits that way no its that way
with two dozen other tourists basher crosses the street and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and extracting a small metal hook from his jacket removes it from
its perch so casual about the action that no passerby looks twice at him
second task power
on the night of the fight were gonna throw the switch on sin city
basher its your show
basher drops into the hole pulling the cover over him as we pull up over the bellagio and
dozens of monitors manned by dozens of watchers canvas dozens of casino tables only nasas control rooms house more technology
apart from the fray another bank of monitors manned by two watchers lets call them for no particular reason fat and slim oversee a different section of the casino the
cage its tunnels the elevator and the vault it leads to everything in fact which our team saw in the game room
third task surveillance
casino security has an eye and ear on everything so well want an eye and ear on them
a page of the set danny and rusty borrowed from kuehn associates
danny and livingston study it
well its not the least accessible system ive seen but its close
i dont suppose they have a closed circuit feed i could tap into
danny shakes his head no such luck
then this is definitely a black bag job
do they employ an in house technician
danny looks to rusty who behind them tampers with livingstons audio video setup several portable monitors a laptop and modem telephone headset etc
and one of them is lonely
dance music overwhelms the soundtrack
as we join a lap dance already in progress
a security technician one of the two frank eavesdropped on in the break room shells out twenty bucks every three minutes for a dancer to grind her pelvis against his
and while the technician grins not very soberly and ogles her perfect breasts and paws at her midriff the dancer secretly removes the keycard from his belt
ill be right back honey
dont move a muscle
drunk and in love depends on the muscle
she pouts flirtingly as she does for every idiot who drops a line like that then makes her way to
where rusty waits for her and when she slips him the keycard he slips her a c note
ill have it back within the hour
as he goes say hello to your mom for me
say it yourself
shell be onstage in five minutes
following a bunch of balloons all congratulating happy anniversary
as a delivery boy carries them through the casino and just as hes passing an employees only door complete with sentry and embedded ceiling camera
he bumps into a tourist and the balloons drift out of his hand and into the camera
hey watch it bud
as the balloons fill the frame of one monitor
we have visual impairment on the east door camera
the sentry hears this and spots the balloons covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery boy who by freak accident happens to be virgil malloy
excuse me sir youre going to have to move your balloons
but virgils too busy picking a fight with the tourist surprise surprise turk malloy to listen
who you calling bud pal
who you calling pal friend
who you calling friend
cant think of another bud
and with the sentry out of position
livingston dressed now in a technicians uniform dont worry about how he got it goes quickly to the door and swipes the newly acquired keycard and when it flashes red
to green he enters
livingston takes a moment his brow perspiring hes in the lions den now then checks his palm drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage corridors
livingston appears and as nonchalantly as he can he ambles down a hallway then another until he reaches
an unmarked door next to the entrance to the security center
livingston swipes his keycard to enter
a giant walk in closet switchboard full of wires plugs lights etc
livingston goes to work he splices into all sorts of wires and lines and cables
virgil and turk argue nose to nose accidentally blocking the sentry from the balloons
you hear about this new medical discovery they made
its called a sense of direction
apparently were all supposed to have one
yeah yeah yeah whatever balloon boy
livingstons work here is almost done he clips a small mechanism known in his industry as a spider its small black antenna less and hides in dark places to a
main conduit then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is picking up the spiders feed
one last click into place
causes a brief unnoticed blip on slims monitors
and transmits all the views of the cages onto the monitors upstairs
danny and rusty witness their appearance
why do they paint hallways that color
they say taupe is very soothing
livingston steps outside
his job done he exhales and wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for directions and
his sweat just smeared the ballpoint
hes flying blind
he looks left down a corridor then right trying to remember which way he came from
moving with livingston as he tries to find his way out
he takes a left
whoops again here comes fat dead ahead
livingston has no recourse but to march right by him
livingston continues on and maybe for a second he thinks hes in the clear especially when he sees the exit looming ahead but then fat turns behind him and hails
at last the sentry outmaneuvers virgil and turk and grabs the balloons himself
virgil quickly snatches them back
get your own balloons
livingston approaches the exits keypad and swipes his keycard the light does not flash red to green
on his tail hey
livingston looks he swiped the wrong side of his keycard
he tries again
red flashes to green
he pulls the door
but fat blocks it
livingston peers up certain hes had it
danny and rusty simultaneously lean forward
you dropped this
fat holds out livingstons receiver and drops it in his hand
and hes out
danny and rusty exhale
fourth task construction
the gang hauls building materials lumber tools paint etc
and yen hauls three times his share carrying objects on his head shoulders arms a circus act in a hardware store
we need to build an exact working replica of the bellagio vault
something like that
as linus hauls in materials danny takes him aside
fifth task intelligence
we need those codes linus
from the only man who has all three
learn to love his shadow
back to the team sixth task transport
young and eager wait wait wait
all i get to do is watch him
you gotta walk before you crawl
to linus correcting danny reverse that
toward the malloys sixth task transport
outside a window turk and virgil jump up and down on opposite bumpers of a van testing its durability
inside frank negotiates with billy tim a cal worthingtonesque redneck car dealer who half pays attention to him half frets over the malloys outside
im sorry eighteen five each is the best offer i can make you
playing a bit of a dandy oh i understand perfectly
they are beautiful vans
well i thank you for your time mister
billy tim denham
yes denham like a jean
they shake you know you have lovely hands do you moisturize
franks not letting go of the mans hand the object now is to force billy tim into lowering his price just to get frank out of his office
i swear by it
i try all sorts of lotions
i went through a fragrance free period last year but now im liking this new brand fortified with rose hip
my sister you know she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen built in
just cant get his hand back uh huh
you said youd be willing to pay in cash
you know they say cinnamon is wonderful for your pores
read that on the internet
and that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed but i find that would interfere with my social agenda
problem is i get a reaction to camphor so i cant use traditional remedies
if you could pay cash i could probably drop the price a little
to say seventeen
as frank squeezes a little sixteen each
big smile that would be lovely
overseeing the construction reviewing his list of tasks on his fingers suspecting hes missed one
power surveillance transport
anything i can do
dannys eyes flash from tishkoff to saul behind him dressed in his usual frumpy attire thats what he missed
get your wallet
a tailor fits saul for the finest suits tishkoffs money can buy
as saul smoothes out a coat sleeve
this is nice material
its armani saul
its very nice
sauls not fooling anyone hes scared right down to his florsheims
danny nods to the tailor give us a moment
saul you sure youre ready to do this
saul turns away and when he faces danny again his entire aspect has changed his features stone his eyes icicles
if you ever question me again daniel you wont wake up the following morning
they exchange a long fierce glance sauls eyes never waver
danny signals tishkoff lets pay and saul immediately slumps into his old self
to a mirror he practices
my name is lyman zerga
this time a little deeper my name is lyman zerga
sauls dressed completely and immaculately now in armani with his hair slicked back a brief moustache on his lip and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge of his nose
he continues to practice his accent even deeper now and specifying no geographic origin could be scottish could be israeli
my name is lyman zerga
my name is lyman zerga
danny passes him an envelope full of bills
theres a little over twenty grand there saul
try to make it last
saul pats down his pockets for something he cant find
you seen my
handing him rolaids bought you a fresh roll
the limo pulls to a stop and outside there is a flurry of footsteps before sauls door swings open and turk and virgil both costumed as bodyguards stand waiting for
zerga were here
good luck lyman
hesitates then gets out luck is for losers
saul as lyman zerga makes as low profile an entrance into the bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and trailing him
he approaches a v
good afternoon sir
how can i be of service
my name is lyman zerga
id like a suite please
do you have a reservation with us
long glare at him i dont make reservations
a longer glance at lymans bodyguards tells the concierge this is not a man to be denied
as he jumps to it
outside a restaurants entrance rusty and linus sit before two slot machines idly dropping in quarters as they watch saul receive the royal treatment
tell me about benedict
the guy is a machine
terry benedict emerges from a town car and from his haircut to his smile to his pant cuffs he is effortless perfection
he is vegas royalty yet he denies eye contact to no man
he strides into his casino and appearing behind a pillar linus follows him in
he arrives at the bellagio every day at two p
same town car same driver
remembers every valets name on the way in
not bad for a guy worth three quarters of a billion
the doors open and terry benedict steps out
linus watches from a craps table
offices are upstairs
he works hard hits the lobby floor at seven on the nose
from a balcony benedict stands overlooking the casino floor
his casino manager approaches and they confer
spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager
what do they talk about
benedict likes to know whats going on in his casinos
theres rarely an incident he doesnt know about or handle personally
benedict works the room
he speaks to a japanese high roller in japanese to a swiss in german etc
he spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rollers
hes fluent in spanish german and italian and hes taking japanese lessons getting pretty good at it
hes out by seven thirty when an assistant hands him a black portfolio
contents the days take and new security codes
then he heads to the restaurant
indeed as benedict makes his exit an assistant hands him a black portfolio
rusty and linus watch the entrance no one enters
give him another ten seconds
around the corner comes benedict carrying his black portfolio
as i said a machine
and that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors
two minutes after theyve been changed hes got em in hand
beat ill tell you you guys picked a helluva target
he is as smart and ruthless as they come
the last guy caught cheating here benedict not only sent him up for ten years he got the bank to seize the guys home and bankrupted his brother in laws
tractor dealership i heard
he doesnt just go after your knees he goes after your livelihood
and everyone you ever mets livelihood
only in the morning
beat now what
now comes the girl
if she comes in after he does that means theyre in a snit
wheres she come from
the museum downstairs
shes the curator there
here she is
youll like this
rusty looks up as
a beautiful woman the one danny saw on benedicts arm in the new york times photo appears
elegantly dressed a knockout she moves very much in her own private space
and rustys face just about drops at the sight of her
i dont know if we can use her yet
i havent even caught her name
looks very certain about this very certain and very upset her name is tess
construction continues into the wee hours
a facsimile of the bellagio vault sprouts into shape
livingston fixes a security camera in a corner then matches its image of frank staple gunning floorboard into place to a security tape of the real mccoy
on the other side of the garage turk and virgil go to work on their newly purchased vans with wrenches and blow torches
tishkoff recognizes a gasket virgil handles
this looks familiar
whered you get this
off your rolls
tell em not to touch the rolls
overlooking the whole enterprise is danny grinning from ear to ear happy in his work
he checks a stopwatch in his hand as
the false top to the cash cart before him flies open revealing yen within his arms legs and torso folded into a three by four foot space
he whips an air hose from his mouth and inhales deeply
danny checks his watch
everything okay in there
of course danny doesnt understand him
but rusty does appearing behind him
but what doesnt beat the shit out of being a circus performer
danny turns to rusty he looks very very serious
danny and rusty adjourn from the warehouse
what is it
tell me this isnt about her
or ill walk off the job right now
off dannys reaction tess
shes with terry benedict now
tell me this isnt about screwing the guy whos screwing your wife
you said you needed a reason
well this is mine
beat when we started in this business we had three rules
we werent gonna hurt anybody
we werent gonna steal from anybody didnt have it coming
and we were gonna play the game like we had nothing to lose
well i lost something
thats why im here
heres the problem were stealing two things now
and when push comes to shove if you cant have both which are you gonna choose
and remember tess doesnt divide eleven ways
if things go to plan i wont be the one who has to make that choice
the two men stand quietly for a moment
howd she look by the way
ive seen her happier
radiant is the word
the painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall between a van gogh and a monet
at a distance admiring it are tess the seller and the sellers aide de camp
a staff photographer and other personnel mill nearby
off to the side in a sharp blazer tess stands transfixed by the painting
he painted it in the summer of after the break up with fernande olivier
she must have put him through hell
you can see the conflict
he makes her both erotic and grotesque
hes hopelessly drawn to her and yet she drives him crazy
checking his watch mr
santaniello has an early flight
do you think mr
benedict will be late
benedict is never late
just then the double doors to the gallery swing open and terry benedict enters right on time
he is elegant beaming commanding
all thats missing is a blare of trumpets
am i late
not at all mr
greeting him allow me to introduce to you mr
to seller mr
santaniello i apologize if i kept you
i had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter
i gave him an unlimited budget and he exceeded it
i understand its going to be a hell of a fight
tess angles benedict toward the painting
here it is
benedict moves toward the painting and as he does he catches tess in his glance and his smile deepens
ive been following her for fifteen years now
at last ive made her a home
to tess all the arrangements and so forth
she belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel
isnt that right ms
shes lovely isnt she
as the seller is confused benedict specifies painting i cant be the only one who was after her
youre the only one who met my price
ah but this
you cant put a price on beauty
but i shouldnt philosophize
i own casinos after all
can we get a quick shot
santaniello has a plane to catch
of course of course
tess understands she is not to be part of the photo
benedict and the seller pose together and
the seller exits with the aide de camp in tow
benedict remains enthralled by the painting
tess appears beside him
you like it
i like that you like it
beat i have some bad news from the world of high fashion
it seems mike tyson will be wearing red on saturday night
red trunks with a white stripe
and you as i recall will be wearing a red donna karan
and when the tv cameras pick us up in the front row that red dress
hes a charming man but no ones going to be watching him when they can make a study of you
ive asked paolo to find three or four things for you to try
i hope youre not too disappointed
she is but she buries it
are you sure
she nods smiles faintly
ill see you tonight
instinctively she leans in to kiss him
he recoils ever so slightly
he lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling over all the eye in the sky cameras hidden there
she follows his look
in my hotels theres always someone watching
but he kisses her anyway
ill see you tonight
he glances once more on the picasso as he moves away
actually i do like it
and tess remains thinking hes rich hes handsome and wooing but is she happy
thru thru quiet elegant tense
one table is operating only in the corner and at it saul as lyman zerga furtively peels at the roll of rolaids and slips one in his mouth
weak stomach mr
i dont believe in weakness
it costs too much
i dont believe in questions either
this shuts the high roller up fast
saul looks up from the table just perceptibly to spot terry benedict on his way in right on schedule
he approaches the pit boss by the entrance
anything for me
in the third position
wishes to speak with you privately
who is he
businessman of some kind working mostly in europe
hes very vague but i asked around
word is he deals primarily in arms
one of the biggest
never heard of him
thats why i dont doubt it
hes staying here
checked in two nights ago sir
hes in the mirador suite
hows he doing
almost forty grand
knowing he cant duck this good for him
tess ocean sits in a booth and sips at a glass of wine and checks her watch benedict is late or very close to being so
when a pair of hands slips over her shoulders and starts to caress her arms
without looking at him youre thirty seconds late
i was about to send out a search party
recognizing the hands she turns stunned danny
standing over her grinning hello tess
thrilled and petrified and stunned to see him but outraged mostly what are you doing here
the day i went for cigarettes and never came back
you must have noticed
i dont smoke
as he sits dont sit but he does they said id paid my debt to society
funny i never got a check
tess stares daggers
you cant stay
its good to see you
youre not wearing your ring
i sold it
and i dont have a husband
or didnt you get the papers
my last day inside
i told you id write
danny reaches his hand ringed for hers ringless but she removes it from the table
she freezes danny knows
he smiles its okay
then to a passing waiter his fingers two inches apart whiskey and then one inch apart whiskey
youre doing a great job curating the museum
she sighs exasperated
the vermeer is quite good
simple but vibrant
although his work definitely fell off as he got older
remind you of anyone
and i still get monet and manet confused
which one married his mistress
manet had syphilis
they also painted occasionally
you dont know how many times i played this conversation out in my head the last two years
did it always go this poorly
you were never easy
as she shrugs okay
ill make this quick
i came here for you
im gonna get on with my life and i want you with me
youre a thief and a liar
i only lied about being a thief
but i dont do that anymore
im with someone now who doesnt have to make that kind of distinction
no hes very clear on both
work on that for two years too
year and a half
a light smile from tess
do you know what your problem is
i only have one
youve met too many people like you
then im with terry now
does he make you laugh
he doesnt make me cry
at the table saul bets heavily for the bank
benedict approaches stands off to the right watching
to saul noticing his heavy bet you dont want to get in the hole too heavy to this benedict
a friend of mine once borrowed a hundred gs from the guy
two months went by benedict hadnt heard from him he calls my friend up asks wheres my money
ill get to it when i get to it my friend says
half hour later benedicts in my friends hotel room dangling him off his th floor balcony by his feet
you gonna get to it now
high roller turns over a nine
bank wins natural nine
benedict steps forward
they put too much grenadine in my shirley temple
and here i thought you were drinking vodka
turning attention to saul mr
i recognize you from the tv
you know nine casinos out of ten owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what i want
i respect your waiting
youre the guest sir
and i have to impose on your hospitality
can you sit in for a hand
id love to mr
zerga but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers
thats a shame
youre the king of vegas and you have to play craps in the alley
no shame at all
reminds me of my youth
benedict and saul are huddled in a corner
the fight is saturday is it not
i can get you seats
hand to hand combat doesnt interest me
i have a package arriving here saturday evening
a black briefcase standard size the contents of which are very valuable to me
id be happy to put it in the house safe for you
the house safe is for brandy and grandmothers pearls
im afraid i need something more secure
i can assure you the house safe is utterly
his looks stops benedict i can assure you mr
benedict your generosity in this matter will not go overlooked
now what can you offer me besides the safe
sauls eyes are pure steel he is not a man familiar with being denied
and benedict recognizes that fact
see the kind of people you steal things from they have insurance to compensate them
they get made whole again
i had to leave new york to get away from what happened
how do i get my five years back danny
but what you can do is not throw away another five years
you dont know anything about leaning in listen you dont love me anymore you want to make a life with someone else
fine ill have to live with that
but not him
spoken like a true ex husband
im not joking tess
im not laughing
beat you have to admit theres a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life
danny exhales and leans back
but that doesnt mean im wrong
she looks at him and maybe part of her knows that he isnt
she looks down at his ring somewhat wistful
he sees her looking at it
do you remember what i said to you when we first met
you said you better know what youre doing
because truly you should walk out the door if you dont
i know what im doing
what are you doing
terry benedict is hovering over them fresh from his meeting with saul
terry meet my ex husband
extending his hand danny ocean
taking it mr
to tess forgive me for being late
a guest required my attention
danny was just walking through the restaurant and spotted me
is that right
i was shocked myself
imagine the odds
of all the gin joints in all the world
beat youve been in prison until recently isnt that right
how does it feel to be out
about the same
everything you want is still on the other side
theres the human condition for you
terry danny was just about to
i just wanted to say hello
for old times sake
stay for a drink if you like
he cant simultaneously i cant
an awkward silence
benedict takes tesss hand in his
well then i dont imagine well be seeing you again mr
you never know
i know everything that happens in my hotels
so i should put those towels back
the towels you can keep
smiles rises good seeing you tess
take care danny
when hes out the door
im sorry like lightning dont be
moving with danny as he exits his fingers snapping he saw the mist in tesss eyes just now he knows hes got a fighting chance with her but what he
does not know is
linus is tailing him ten steps back
he stops glances back at the restaurant quizzically then continues following danny
nobody lights a match this place is a powder keg
basher sits on his bed surrounded by combustibles whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape
theres a knock at the door
eyes never leave his work just jumping into the shower can you come back later
the maid moves on on tv a reporter broadcasts live
were here at the historic paradiso hotel and casino once the prize resort of las vegas now seconds away from demolition
just down the block from the terry benedict trinity stands for a few remaining moments the edifice of the paradiso reuben tishkoffs bankrupted hotel casino
a crowd has gathered to witness its destruction terry benedict for one his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight tess another standing near by her man
danny too hidden within the masses eyes fixed on his ex and linus who keeps a steady bead on danny
and heres reuben tishkoff former owner of the paradiso come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish terry benedict all the best with his future plans for the
terry greets reuben before the tv cameras and newspaper reporters and everyones smiling and shaking hands but behind those smiles and under their breaths
good to see you
go shit in your mouth
tess her eyes roaming the crowd finds a pair staring back at her dannys
she holds his glance a moment long enough for both linus and benedict to notice before turning away to
benedict who puts his public smile back on and steps up to a podium alongside mike tyson and lennox lewis and together they all put their hands on the plunger
and benedict leans into a microphone
i hope theres as much dynamite in the paradiso as there will be in this saturdays fight
and whoomph the plunger comes down and write your own onomatopoeia here the paradiso implodes
reuben wipes a tear from his eye
as the paradiso crumbles outside his window the lights and tv in his room flicker and go out
as he scrambles out the door making sure to post a do not disturb sign
saturday day is yours
do whatever you like with it
from above slowly descending ten of our eleven basher is missing surround the model of the three casinos
rusty leads everyone in a run down of the heist
call is at five thirty
makeup and costume
sauls package arrives at seven fifteen and linus grabs our codes
all goes well there and were a go
seven thirty virgil and turk deliver yen and were committed
from that point we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates
we descend onto the miniature of the vault then from above descending still this is the real deal
the bellagio vault
a clock reads
once the electricity goes all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes
thats when we make our move
two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vaults center and march out again closing the thick metal door behind them
when the vault locks click
we stop descending just above the cash cart
there is silence for a spell the lights flicker out then
the false top of the cart springs open revealing yen within folded neatly
he inhales deeply then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until at last he crouches atop it
he takes in the room vacant and silent
except for rusty who walks right by him incongruously
okay theyve put you in the middle of the room far from everything
you have to get from here to the door without touching the floor
what do you do
a wider angle reveals were
the bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here and what weve been watching has been a trial run
ten of the eleven turk and virgil in guard costumes basher is still missing watch from offstage like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal
fin says he shorts it
make it a sawbuck
from a dead squat yen leaps hands first from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor
from this position hell inch his way to a counter then to the door
frank pays up
behind him a door slams and he turns to see basher at last
sniffing the air he double takes bashers covered head to toe in sewage
and hes not happy were in deep shit
linus hoses basher off his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word hes saying thats okay
the damn demo crew didnt use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline
onioned the mainframe couplet
reuben leans into livingston
you understand any of this
ill explain later
blew the backup grid one by one
as he hardly understands this either basher
a cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse boxes and basher tails them hiding near a waterfall of effluent
they did exactly what i planned to do
only they did it by accident
now they know their weakness
and theyre fixing it
an echoing footstep draws the attention of the city engineers and basher retreats into the waterfall
basher towels off his hair
so unless we decide to do this job in reno were screwed
danny rises and paces frustrated
hes come too far for things to go awry now
we could by tomorrow
danny keeps pacing rusty hangs his head and thinks basher dries his hair
an idea occurs to him we could use a pinch
danny stops rusty looks up
what is a pinch
scientists demonstrate the pinch a lithium wire in a glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator
a pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad band electrical circuitry
or better yet a pinch is a bomb
but without the bomb
every time a nuclear weapon detonates it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity
that tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway
now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse but without the headache of mass destruction and death
so instead of hiroshima you get the seventeenth century
for how long
about ten seconds
could a pinch take out the power of an entire city
like i dont
beat but theres only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it
danny and rusty trade a look they have their answer
a beat then balefully pasadena
headlights hit a sign cal tech
high security area
a white van shoots past it
turk and virgil man the front seats as danny basher yen and linus huddle in the back
basher and yen both prepare equipment for their raid hooks and a rope for yen a small blowtorch and a drill for basher
to basher and yen you two ready
they nod and with danny start out the vans rear door
linus starts to follow but
what are you doing
coming with you
danny smiles and shakes his head
the van door slams in his face
danny picks a lock then he yen and basher disappear into the labs interior
linus twiddles his thumbs tired of being seated at the kids table
meanwhile up front another mensa meeting has been called to order
are you a man
are you alive
okay your turn
co sign squared over
co sign squared over
youre so wrong
you dont know your string theory bitch
after a spell of silence
mom told me she loves me more
she told me she was going to tell you that
they can be heard wrestling
linus has had enough
he sneaks out the vans back door without the malloys hearing him
linus sulks along the laboratorys perimeter finds the door danny pick locked and disappears inside
a moment passes
a moment passes
and the next door opens and danny basher and yen appear pinch in hand theyve succeeded
they weave a path to the van
turk and virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears
danny basher and yen pile in the back
we got it
turk floors it and theyre off
wait a minute
turk brakes and theyre not
everyone realizes hes not here
just then sirens and alarms and lights come to life
danny spins to look out the back of the van basher by his side
his eyes scan the compound then there he is
of the lab and its beveled glass stairwell
linus scrambles up its steps a flight ahead of a duo of chasing guards
as he ascends out of sight
danny shifts his focus to the other side of the building and two more guards arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase linus will be trapped
danny basher and yen squat side by side by side watching all this
yen makes a colorful observation about linuss predicament of course no one understands it
one of us should help him
who speaks dannys mind then therell be two of us who need saving
he knows where we are
both sets of guards appear on the rooftop and find no linus between them hes disappeared
whered he go
danny and basher slowly turn turk and virgil crouch inches behind them wanting to spectate as well
off dannys look what
then realizing their goof to his brother remonstratively would you shouldnt someone be behind the wheel
a second story window explodes as a desk chair flies through it followed shortly by linus who leaps onto a steel mesh overhang running alongside the building
alright back it up back it up
virgil leaps into the drivers seat shifts into reverse
linus runs along the overhang then leaps down onto the reversing van and rolls along its roof and down its windshield
through the windshield virgil jabs his thumb over his shoulder get in the back
appearing from the rear doors cmon cmon
linus scrambles back over the van and danny and yen pull him in
virgil hits the gas for a quick getaway but he does so before the rear doors are closed and one of them slams shut right on yens hand crunch
as it hurtles away
basher tends to yen cradling his hand and danny stares down linus breathless
i say stay in the van you stay in the van got it
cause you lose focus for one second in this game and someone gets hurt
hes had just about enough of dannys shit i got it
they continue staring daggers at one another as
the van pulls away into the night
its fight night in las vegas
incoming lanes of the i reflect bumper to bumper steel planes in the air are stacked for five miles over the desert even gila monsters below seem vegas bound
people are flooding in from all over the country to see what has been dubbed the fight to end all fights
jim lampley broadcasts live from a mobbed strip
and even though its still five hours til the opening bell the energy here is fever pitched
every table is in play every seat filled
the bellagios casino manager the one linus spied with benedict before checks in with his watchers
how we doing
livingston has moved a v operations into lyman zergas suite
as he scours the same images the watchers downstairs do he eavesdrops on their communications through his headset
over livingstons headset cotton couldnt be taller
lost in the luxury his role dictates saul floats in a full sized jacuzzi and chews on a hundred dollar cigar reuben meanwhile paces the floor nervously
where are they
thats what i want to know
where are they
as lyman theyll be here
to himself mocking lyman theyll be here
thanks a lot fidel
punching up a new set of views from the eye in the sky livingston thrusts forward alarmed by one
rusty keeps watch on the hotels side entrance
he glances at his watch then outside again as the white van arrives dropping off only linus and danny who slaps the vans roof before it pulls away
as danny and linus enter the lobby rusty falls into step with them exchanging a smile with danny but not linus he still looks chastised from the car trailer
you boys have a nice trip
rusty smiling looks to linus glowering then to danny
before danny can explain the doors part at the mirador suite where livingston greets them urgently
we have a problem
a mug shot of danny complete with vital information height weight criminal history
youve been red flagged
it means the moment you step on the casino floor theyll be watching you
hawks with video cameras
this is a problem
a pall falls over the room this is more than a problem this is disastrous
only saul dares make a noise humming and splashing in the next room
saul time to get out
as lyman its time when i say it is
we hear him jump to it out of the tub
himself again im out
back to danny you have any idea how this happened
before danny can answer
hes been chasing benedicts woman
got into a real snarl with him two nights ago
off dannys look i was tailing you
who told you to do that
before linus can answer
he and danny hold a stare i knew you couldnt leave tess alone
appearing in a bathrobe tess is here
eyes still on danny im sorry
i didnt know if it would sting you but it did
the most difficult words hes ever had to say youre out danny
its that or we shut down right now
his involvement puts us all at risk
danny and rusty face off furious with each other
this isnt your call
you made it my call
when you put her ahead of us
you made it mine
this is my job
danny stares daggers at rusty
but he can see everyone in the room is on rustys side
defeated he stalks out of the room onto a balcony but not without staring down linus
he cant just be out
whos gonna take his place
rusty turns to linus
kid you up for it
linuss eyes drift to danny outside whatever acrimony he felt before he never meant to kick danny off the job
he nods half cocksure half scared pissless hes up for it
to livingston find everyone else
let em know the change in plan
curtain goes up at seven
everyone else in the room staggers about like witnesses after an execution
rusty steps out onto the balcony perhaps to console danny but as linus watches them from inside their words cannot be heard
tess is with benedict now
as nobody responds shes too tall for him
tess readying herself for the big evening meets her own glance in a dressing mirror then spots benedict in its reflection pacing the bedroom behind her
on phone yes
very much no
beat then inform mr
levin hell find a better view of the fight in front of his television
surely he must have h
hanging up benedict approaches her puts his hands on her shoulders
what are you thinking about
she smiles at him in the mirror
his glance in it turns from her to himself
riding down terry benedict checks his watch
the elevator doors open and
he steps onto his casinos floor the king of las vegas
the time is
benedict meets his casino manager according to schedule
any sign of ocean
not in a couple hours
you want him out
i can bounce him from the state for parole violation if you like
shakes his head put a guy on him
hes here for a reason
id like to know what it is
but if he comes anywhere near tess take it to the next level
benedict nods goes on his way
saul as lyman zerga stands ramrod straight looking through sliding glass doors out at the valet station
from behind terry benedict approaches two security guards walking half a pace behind him
saul spots him in the glasss reflection he does not turn
its a very busy night for me
are we on schedule
i have no reason to suspect otherwise
my couriers should be here momentarily
a beat as benedict studies saul
its a nice evening
shall we wait outside
benedict and saul emerge guards positioned around them
theyre in position
over static okay
were a go
a white unmarked van pulls in from the street and races up to the curb where saul and benedict wait
turk malloy gets out the passengers side a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist as virgil comes around from the drivers side both of them dressed in their bodyguard suits
a gift from mr
turk extends the briefcase to saul so that they both clasp the handle as virgil produces a key unlocks the cuff on turks wrist transfers it to sauls clamps it
shut and hands saul the key
thank you friedrich gunther
he turns nods to benedict and they retreat into the hotel the security guards and malloys flanking them
frank deals blackjack to a full table
his eyes gaze past his players to saul the guards and benedict passing by
as he busts lookin like a bad night for the house
moving with benedict as he spies out of the corner of his eye danny lurking at a slot machine
to one of his guards
tell him mr
oceans in the west slots
the guard goes and benedict continues with saul
im afraid i cant allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages
i hope you dont mind
of course not
saul turns to dismiss virgil and turk when
passing by on his way to a sports betting window an old racetrack denizen happens past this cabal and worse yet happens to recognize saul
saul bloom is that you
saul does his best to ignore the man
but even benedict notices this guy seems to know lyman zerga
saul its me
bucky buchanan remember
at last saul turns to face this man with sharks eyes
an order dispose of this man
virgil and turk pick up the denizen by his elbows and haul him away
gesturing to the cage re his briefcase cuff please i have never enjoyed the touch of steel to my skin
danny sits in a row of octogenarians all vacantly dropping coins and pulling levers
as he watches saul and benedict disappear into the cage
danny smiles a big winner but hes got bigger pots to win tonight
he steers a neighboring senior citizen blind as a bat to his slot machine
pops you won
then slips away
linus stands dressed in a sharp conservative suit a far cry from the threadbare thief in chicago
rusty circles him inspecting
where you gonna put your hands
linus clasps them
linus goes for his pockets
not the pockets either
and dont touch your tie
look at me
that how you gonna stand
linus shifts his balance
i ask you a question you have to think of the answer where you gonna look
linus looks down
you look down they know youre lying linus looks up
and up they know you dont know the truth
dont use three words when one will do dont shift your eyes look always at your mark but dont stare be specific but not memorable funny but dont make him
laugh hes gotta like you then forget you the moment youve left his sight and for gods sakes whatever you do dont under any circumstances rust can you come here a sec
wandering off sure thing
linus is left utterly bewildered a thousand commandments to remember and fifteen minutes to remember them in
turk and virgils white van whips around a corner and shoots inside
of which importantly we never see the exterior just an air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror
the white van screeches to a halt inches from basher who stands ready beside the pinch and the now gutted and dismantled mockup of the bellagio vault and faster than
a nascar pit crew basher turk and virgil load the pinch into the white vans rear and before you can say electromagnetic pulse the van screeches back out of the warehouse fully loaded
the time is
the room is empty save for a large table
saul places his briefcase on it adjusts its numbered combination locks and opens it
inside the case five rows of glittering emeralds
theyre very beautiful
saul stares at him none of your fucking business
can you lift them out please
saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case and benedict pats down the cases interior
saul replaces the tray
i acknowledge that the case does not contain any dangerous or illicit material
i further agree to take custody of your case for a twenty four hour period to store in our secured vault
while i cannot permit you to accompany the case to the vault
insurance for one
and i dont trust you
there is a knock at the door and walsh the casino manager enters
he speaks low in benedicts ear
i put two plainclothes on ocean
hes at the keno bar now
walsh nods and benedict turns back to saul
zerga this is mr
walsh my casino manager
if you will allow he will arrange for your briefcase to be stored inside our vault while you watch on a security monitor
beat those are my terms
yes or no
saul and benedict eyeball each other
you leave me no choice
saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist
the white van slows enough to unload virgil and turk changed into waiter uniforms and they hurry a table clothed room service cart inside as basher pulls away
rising from a spotless pair of wingtips shifting side to side over hands flexing and stretching up to linus caldwell
he keeps an eye on the cage door waiting for benedict to appear as he tries anything to shake out his nerves
then from a discreet earpiece he wears comes deep breaths
youll do fine
breathes deep thanks
no sweat kid
youre a rock
as linus smiles feeling good about himself now dont fuck up
linuss smile disappears as he continues to bounce
theres a knock at the door
rusty checks through the peephole then ushers in turk and virgil in costume with their room service cart
who ordered the penne
livingston raises a hand and as turk serves him his plate virgil whips off the carts tablecloth underneath its the false lid cash cart
rusty turns to a corner
in it yen finishes bandaging his busted hand and nods
fat and slim sit before their monitors feet kicked up as behind them walsh benedict and saul enter
this is our security center where we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault
youll be able to monitor your briefcase from here
walsh finding fat and slim as they are coughs the two watchers leap immediately to their feet
benedict checks his watch
dont let me keep you
and benedict takes his leave
linus nods shakes out his hands some more
deep breaths deep breaths
and here comes benedict exiting the cage just as his assistant arrives with his portfolio
as he turns toward the restaurant
presents proper identification sheldon wills
nevada gaming commission
could i have two minutes of your time
benedict sighs his evenings been sidetracked enough already but
anything for the danny watches benedict escort linus toward the blackjack tables unaware that two plainclothes security goons watch him from across the bar and when he turns in their
direction they look away acting incognito but its not them hes turning toward
its tess rounding a corner toward the restaurant
danny jumps to his feet throws a tip on the bar and goes
the time is
yen tucks himself into the cash carts hidden compartment with a slim oxygen tank for company
meanwhile rusty drills virgil and turk
okay when do you make the deposit
not until we get your signal
what do we look like a couple of peckerwood jackasses or something
no one responds
turning his attention to yen squeezed into the cart amazing hows it feel
as yen nods want something to read
from the tangle of limbs a middle finger protrudes to show rusty what he can do with a magazine
im counting down
thirty minutes of breathing time starts
on now a running clock appears on screen descending from
it will remain there for the duration of the pre pinch heist jumping at times between scenes
rusty seals yen inside the cash cart then gives the top a tug its shut tight
as virgil redresses it with the tablecloth turk snatches back livingstons penne on the way to the door
you get no tip
moving with benedict and linus into the pit bosss station
it only came to our attention this morning mr
apparently he has a record longer than my arm
if he is who you say he is
hailing a pit boss charlie
call over ramon escalante
benedict and linus wait side by side
while linus does his best to play it cool benedict dips into his portfolio
an overhead view of benedict as he pulls out the combination to the vault reads it then buries it in his jacket pocket
did you make it out
his head blocked the last two numbers
into his microphone we missed it linus
you gotta grab the combination yourself
linus half nods in response and benedict notices
suspicious of the young man he decides to test him
you new at the commission
been there about two years
i know hal lindley over there
you work with him at all
a pause will he pass
not since he died last year
the pit boss returns with frank in tow
would you come with us please
whats this about
i think its better if we talked off the floor
linus and benedict lead frank away
as they pass an elevator
its doors open revealing turk and virgil dressed now as security guards pushing out the false lid cash cart
they leave behind a pile of dishes waiter uniforms a tablecloth
a maitre d scours his reservations list then peers up to find reuben tishkoff approaching on either side of him two gorgeous young women all blonde hair and breasts and
legs women who wouldnt give hefner the time of day
good evening mr
good evening marcel
my nieces and i would like a table
something quiet before the fight
i can put you at in just a couple minutes
quick as you can
re the girls the meters running here
the maitre d turns to his next customer tess
she of course merits a table instantly
good evening miss ocean
right this way
reuben cant help but stare as tess passes by
his eyes linger a little too long and a little too low
reuben pivots its danny and he strolls past reuben and his lady friends and into the restaurant
try to keep your tongue in your mouth
shocked to see danny thinks hes off the job but covering yeah pal well only if you take your thumb out of your
reuben gets brushed from behind by the two plainclothes goons following danny
outraged hey you have any idea who i think i am
just as shes sitting danny approaches
she goes straight at him apoplectic
ill just be a moment
im having you thrown out of here
she starts past him he grabs her arm to keep her and she wheels on him
youre up to something danny
and dont say you came here for me
youre pulling a job arent you
well know this no matter what it is you wont win me back
i cant afford it
i just came to say good bye
this surprises tess and truth be told saddens her she studies him a moment unsure of what to say
danny starts for her cheek stops to see if its alright with her she sad eyed does not recoil and then gently kisses it
danny leaves her
tess watches him go
already missing him good bye danny
danny runs smack into the plainclothes goons
benedict would like to see you
resignedly these men are much too big to tangle with i thought he might
the plainclothes goons escort danny away right past reuben who frowns concerned
frank stands at attention before linus and benedict
linus straddling a desk takes a beeper off his belt when it pinches him
benedict checks his watch the fights opening bell is growing closer and closer
thank you for your cooperation mr
as frank nods not at all or should i call you mr
frank bristles tries not to let it show
linus pulls out a xeroxed mug shot and bio of him
you are frank catton
formerly of the tropicana the desert inn and the new york state penitentiary system
as frank remains quiet your silence suggests you dont refute that
to benedict mr
benedict im afraid youve been employing an ex convict
as you know the n
under his breath goddamn cracker
a pause he cant believe he just heard that pardon me
leering at linus simmering you heard me
just cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state
that has nothing to do with
over him ranting some cracker cowboy like yous gotta kick him out on the street
want me to jump down turn around pick a bale of cotton wont let me deal cards might as well call it whitejack
a beat then i resent your implication that race has anything to do with this
to benedict now as i was saying the nevada gaming commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored
whoops i mean
that does it frank attacks linus lunging at the man and as benedict steps in to separate the two
linuss hand dips into his tuxedo jacket and withdraws the vault combination
okay okay im cool
to linus you alright
a beat then yeah
hearing this hes got it
into his mike virgil turk deliver your package
two guards stand sentry outside the cage door
virgil and turk move up with their cash cart and when virgil reaches for his keycard
aw i think
i lost my card
the guards frown at him
a security officer approaches
whats going on here
i lost my keycard
and this he knows will get this guard fired okay
leave the cart
go find it
to one of the sentries take this cart inside
the sentry nods swipes his keycard and enters with the cash cart
turk and virgil hesitate a moment to watch it enter then hurry off
on a monitor the sentry pushes the cart down a cage corridor
on another sauls briefcase is escorted by another guard to the vault elevator
on another danny is escorted inside the cage by the plainclothes goons
there it is now
beginning to sweat this a bit nerves overtaking him wonderful
the yen filled cash cart joins sauls briefcase on the elevator
pull out to
thats my cue
as he exits give basher the go
into mike bash whats your status
driving the white van listening to a books on tape of jane eyre
turning bronte down no need to yell
whats your status
and he screeches to a halt on the parking structures top level
vegas can be seen in every direction
benedict exits the casino managers office with linus and frank
benedict hails two guards
please show this man off the premises
to frank dont step foot in my casino again
as hes led away over his shoulder to linus cracker
benedict checks his watch again hes really running late
wills if you dont mind
as linus forgets to respond mr
they start toward the exit
but halfway there
i forgot it
benedict hesitates hes in an enormous hurry now hes behind schedule he hates being behind schedule but leaving even a member of the gaming commission alone in his cage is
a security risk
one glace at the cameras all about and he decides to risk it
you know how to get back out
enjoy the fight
shaking his hand then hurrying away thank you
linus smiles after him withdrawing the page of combinations he lifted off the man
the guards show frank out
frank tries to tip them
but they snarl at him before returning inside
frank smiles and goes on his way his job complete
danny sits opposite two plainclothes goons in absolute silence waiting
how much longer do you think mr
benedict will be
just a few minutes more
he scans the room
no cameras in this room huh
dont want anyone seeing what happens here
the goons say nothing
danny checks his watch
hes not coming is he
the goons look at each other danny has called their bluff
theres a knock at the door and the goons smile dannys about to find out who
one goon rises to usher in
the bruiser come to beat the shit out of danny ocean
the guys at least six six three hundred pounds but its not his size that draws attention its his teeth
or the lack thereof the bruiser doesnt hold a single incisor molar or bicuspid in his mouth
and theres something really terrifying about the sight
i guess mr
benedict didnt like me talking to his girl
the goons shake their heads
danny smiles at the bruiser and the bruiser snarls back showing off those gums
he rolls up his shirtsleeves itching to tear a hole in this man
the goons head for the door
were gonna step outside now
leave you two alone to talk things over
the goons exit
danny and the bruiser face off
and as danny opens his mouth to speak bruisers fist flashes out and knocks him down
danny rises wiping a little blood from his lip
jesus bruiser not til later
i i forgot
shaking it off hows the wife
then we better get to work
standing guard outside the goons hear punches and groans from inside as
danny climbs onto bruisers shoulders and pushes through the ceiling rafters groaning every time bruiser slaps his fist into his hand
a guard wheels in the yen filled cash cart parks it in a station next to its twin then as an afterthought plants sauls briefcase right on top if it
clunk an unforeseen obstacle to yens escape
saul witnesses this too and stifles a reaction
does that satisfy you mr
yes im very satisfied
to slim close it up
on the monitor the vault door closes but saul looks anything but satisfied
hes sweaty his mouths so dry he cant swallow and he keeps patting down his pockets for his rolaids without finding them
you alright sir
as he circumspectly approaches the vault elevator door checking up and down hallways for guards
on a monitor linus comes into view
almost there kid
and saul spots him but so does fat
and saul cant handle the suspense he grips his arm and groans and this is no ulcer problem this is a full fledged cardiac and walsh fat and slim all
attend to him their backs turned as
linus hurries to the elevator punching benedicts combination into a keypad
the elevator doors open for him
livingston punches a few keys
going to video now
as saul and his heart attack hold the spotlight a security monitor flips from a shot of linus entering the elevator to a livingston fed videotape of an empty lift
as saul passes out call for a doctor
linus immediately reaches up to the elevators ceiling rips down its panel to reveal a trap door
as he starts to push it open
a hand yanks it free from above
you didnt really think i was gonna sit this one out did you
what didnt you trust me
i do now
he reaches down and pulls linus wide eyed up to the roof of the elevator
the boxers enter the ring before a full cheering house
benedict and tess find their ringside seats a row in front of reuben and his nieces
ladies and gentlemen
rusty approaches the sentry on duty at the cage door
someone called for a doctor
danny rips off his jacket and shirt to expose a rappelling line wrapped around his torso
linus does the same
howd you get here
and i had to give away a couple mil
but what about i mean that whole thing with rusty
danny just smiles at him
earlier that night just after rusty kicked danny off the job
as linus watches from inside deaf to their conversation blind to their expressions danny and rusty confer
you think the kid bought it
hell i think reuben bought it and he knew we were screwing around
beat you sure about this
nods bobby caldwell threw me into the pool first time
least i could do is give his kid a push
whyd you make me go through all this
why not just tell me
well wheres the fun in that
starting toward elevator shaft ladder cmon yens got about three minutes of air left
danny leads linus down and around the elevator and side by side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from falling
meanwhile we descend quickly down the shaft just to illustrate how very high up they are
rusty playing doctor inspects saul
at the same time he inspects a monitor the vault door closing with the yen filled cash cart and sauls briefcase inside
rusty stops listens to sauls chest then drops his head
walsh fat and slim all bow their heads
at the door two paramedics arrive with a stretcher
youre too late guys
the first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes him to turk i told you to hurry
as danny and linus work affixing suction cupped anchors to their rappelling lines
who do you like tonight
tyson or lewis
as danny nods lewis
as danny shoots him a look you like tyson
as danny nods how strongly do you feel about it
you looking for action
shrugs id go in for a buck
a buck it is
and theyre ready poised at the top looking into the abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared sensors
into his mike livingston were set
rusty leads the paramedics out with dead saul on their gurney
into his mike livingston were set
hearing this into his mike basher were set
fixing the pinch atop his van just give me a minute
we dont have a minute
yens gonna pass out in thirteen seconds
then give me thirteen seconds
and basher leaps down to hook up the pinchs wires to his vans engine
the opening bell rings round one
the fighters break from their corners feinting jabbing
sitting ringside benedict looks at tess and smiles as she winces at the first sharp blow
peering down into blackness danny and linus prepare to let go any moment
you ever rappelled before
basher finishes preparations
into his mike ready
over earpiece then hit it
basher flips the switch
a quick tremor then stillness
he picks a point on the horizon like babe ruth and suddenly
whole blocks of lights disappear
casinos vanishing one by one
every pink light vanishes
the fountain goes flaccid
the roller coaster stops dead its passengers keep their arms raised not sure what to do
both fighters move in simultaneously sweat flying both reach back both going for the lights out power cut to the jaw when
blip out go the infrared sensors
and he and linus lean forward and fall
down the elevator shaft
upside down heads curled and all we hear is the whoosh of their bodies in motion and the whirl of their cords oceans rev
and now looking straight down the ground is rising up fast to meet them a flat slab of gray concrete fifty feet forty feet thirty feet twenty
and snap the cords reach their full extension and danny and linus bounce up watching the floor recede
in the distance lights come up again first at the mirage then the mgm gradually approaching
coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor danny quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils straight across
he and linus go tumbling to the floor as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their elevator anchors just before
the infrared lights go back on line
the lights suddenly flash back on revealing
both fighters standing and tyson takes advantage of lewiss disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his jaw
down goes lewis and up goes the crowd roaring
one two three
benedict makes a quick survey the arena is apoplectic from the blackout knockout
what the hell was that
he cranes his neck looking around the room surveying his empire he smells a rat
his eyes fall on reuben behind him but reuben just shrugs i didnt pull the plug
to himself the first goddamn round
all the lights are back on and basher observes his achievement with great pride his job complete
viva las vegas
linus and danny arise from where theyve fallen clutching their heads and rubbing bruises
danny doesnt recover as quickly
no but youre sweet to ask
lights are just flickering on here when
the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward slightly
its yen trying to get out out of air and only now alert to sauls heavy case resting atop him
livingston watches this on his monitors just coming back on his finger poised on a play button as frank comes in the door
are they in
a look at him i thought you got kicked out
suddenly one of the monitors aligns itself and livingston presses play
overhead security cam view of the vault corridor the three uzi guards stand idly on duty
and of the vault itself yen trying to get out of the cash cart
overhead security cam view of the vault corridor the three uzi guards stand idly on duty
and in totally different positions
of the vault no cash cart but no zerga briefcase no yen
this tapes from last night
same guards same
his eyes fixing on sauls briefcase pushing closer to the edge of the cash cart as yen tries to free himself
the room is abuzz with activity
the monitors here flicker back on too displaying the images from monitor b but every watcher in the place is watching a table because
the floor is going nuts
after the ten seconds of darkness all bets are off
some players doubled down during the blackout others miraculously halved their bets
consequently livingstons video feed switch goes unnoticed
danny and linus pry open the elevator doors and squeeze out
just beyond the next doorway stand
three uzi carrying guards hovering outside the vault door and wondering what the hell just happened to the lights
yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid and the more he pushes the more sauls briefcase slides off
yen stretches his hand out to grab it but its slid beyond his reach to the edge of falling
the uzi carrying guards turn their backs to the elevator shaft
and linus and danny appear in the doorway they both snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor
sniffing something jesus ron was that you
linus and danny wait danny silently mouthing a three count before
thud thud thud
they peer around the corridor to find
all three uzi carrying guards lie unconscious on the ground
linus starts in danny holds him back
a beat another beat then okay
danny and linus enter waving the faint remnants of the gas from their noses tiptoeing past the guards bodies
you think yen made it out okay
im sure hes fine
sauls briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate this heist here and now
yens hand stretches farther out to grab it pushing up just a little more on the false lid until
the briefcase tumbles toward the floor
but not before yen snags the handcuff chain attached to it and swings it round
hes got it
that threat over he throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath of his life
linus punches in the code for the door to the vault anteroom the one he stole from benedict
he steps back as it slides open revealing the vault door it is sleek and immense and impregnable
jaw dropping jesus
theres a chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars behind that door
lets get him out
danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard
yen now sits perched atop the cash cart sauls briefcase opened beside him he has removed half of lymans emeralds
he hears the muffled dannys slaps and he knows its time for his leap
its the same distance as the leap he made in the practice session but this time hes only got one good hand
frank and livingston watch nervously
fin says he shorts it
yen prepares for his leap then springs
across the room to the ledge he must grab
and he grabs it but with only one hand hes slipping right away and in a second hell hit the sensored floor
but in a flash he spins and splits his legs propping himself up between two walls inches above the floor
an acrobatic wonder
frank and livingston exhale
wishing he had bet shit
danny oblivious to this close call slaps the door again
a moment passes then yen responds with a slap too
as basher enters livingston and frank watch on a monitor linus punching in the combination he stole from benedict as danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a detonator
theres still the five pins and the floor sensor
not much we can do about that from this side of the door
but from this side
he punches up the image of yen in the vault
a little bit of semtex should do the trick
yen sets the last of lymans emeralds against the vault door like a plastic explosive
which of course it is
he affixes a detonator receiver the size of a golf ball pencil to it then slaps the door twice all set
danny responds with two slaps of his own
he steps back detonator in hand its wires attached to the vault door
counting down from twenty checking watch now
yen starts his retreat from the door but gets yanked back
his hands bandage is caught on the door
seventeen sixteen fifteen yen tries to free himself but he cant use his other hand lest he drop to the floor
he tries gnawing at his bandage which brings his face within inches of a plastic explosive
eleven ten nine livingston et al
are alert to the danger
into his mike linus can you read me
linus do not blow the door youre about to kill yen
linus hears nothing through his earpiece
five four three yen finally frees himself just as zooming into a plastic explosive one he presses his detonator
yen still on the door remains frozen
then he starts to creep back leaping onto a money shelf then another as far from the explosives as he can get
danny presses it again
i dont know
linus comes over to look
you check the batteries
linus shoots him a look
livingston frank and basher watch the monitors in disbelief
saul enters alive and dressed as himself again
his job is complete
everything going okay
as danny checks his batteries the types with built in power meters both at zero percent linus ransacks the uzi carrying guards gear for replacements
he finds aas in their flashlights
you know you lose focus for one second in this game and someone gets hurt yeah yeah
i dont hear yen complaining
he takes the batteries inserts them in his detonator then slaps the door twice more
yen catches his breath on the far end of the room
he hears the slap rolls his eyes and ducks out of the line of fire
danny presses the detonator
the emeralds explode
several muted but powerful blasts
linus inches forward almost dreading this moment pauses
and the door opens
danny and linus enter
the cash carts have crumpled and the vault gratings blackened have held
linus goes to one of the racks and tentatively opens it
yen pops up from within his hair on end looking like he just dropped out of a cyclone
his only english where the fuck you been
livingston frank saul and basher watch as the first wave of bills gets tossed onto the vault floor
smiles all around
ever been in love
considers it for a moment no i guess not
this is better
rusty steps forward as people stream past him out of the fight arena
he dials his cell phone listens
moving with benedict and tess pushing their way out through the crowd
a phone is ringing nearby
again and again
you gonna answer it
i dont have a cell phone
they keep moving but the ring pursues them
finally benedict stops pulls tesss purse from her shoulder and opens it inside he finds a cell phone ringing
it isnt mine
see whos on the other end
she takes the phone activates it
may i have a word with mr
tess looks up confused
its for you
benedict takes the phone
who the hell is this
in the distance at the arenas exit unseen by benedict or tess on the phone
the man whos robbing you
benedict enters and fear enters with him
and of course tess
as the room buzzes with activity he keeps the cell phone pressed to his ear
what the hell is going on down there in the vault
fat points to the security cam view of the vault corridor and vault livingstons tape
on phone venomously im afraid youre mistaken
frank basher and saul watch over livingstons shoulder as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small speaker
youre watching your monitor
okay keep watching
livingston punches in numbers
new images suddenly appear
three masked men in the vault throw stacks of money onto the floor the three uzi guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor
the security center understandably erupts in activity
rusty strolls so casually theres no reason anyone passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a pizza
in this town your luck can change just that quickly
close to apoplectic takes a breath and cups the phone then barks at walsh find out how much money we have down there
tess amid all this chaos is still curious how did that cell phone get into her handbag
and suddenly it hits her
danny starts for her cheek stops to see if its alright with her she sad eyed does not recoil and then gently kisses it
as he slips the cell phone into her handbag unnoticed
on phone alright
youve proved your point
youve broken into my vault
congratulations youre a dead man
may i ask how do you expect to leave here hmm
do you believe ill simply allow you to parade bags full of my money out my casino doors
a distance beyond rusty tess exits the cages
she stops puzzling over what to do happens to spot him
youre gonna carry it out for us
has to laugh and why would i do that
take a closer look at your monitor
as the three masked men stuff money into large canvas bags and mark the bags with xs another portion of cash remains untouched booby trapped
as your managers probably reporting to you by now you have a little over a hundred sixty million in your vault tonight
and as if rusty was in the room watching walsh approaches with the nights cash count
you may notice were only packing up about half that
the other half were leaving in your vault booby trapped as a hostage
you let our eighty million go and you get to keep your eighty
thats the deal
you try and stop us well blow both cash loads
he spins and gasp comes face to face with tess
she stares at him directly she knows
holding her glance mr
benedict you can lose eighty million dollars secretly tonight or you can lose a hundred sixty million dollars publicly
its your decision
he cups the phone
benedict cups his phone too and vents his rage
he knows what he should do let the money go and he knows what he wants to do stop these sonsabitches
he makes his choice
to walsh make the call
walsh grabs a phone punches numbers
livingston listens in on the call
hello this is mr
walsh at the bellagio
we have an incident here
uncupping his phone okay
you have a deal
tess and rusty hold a stare as rusty holds the phone
he wants you to go upstairs and watch tv
a little pissed he does
you have a deal
its alright tess
back on phone good
heres what you do
five minutes from now the men in the vault are going to deposit six bags in the vault elevator
tess isnt sure what to do
as rusty continues on the phone she backs off debating can she blow the whistle on her ex
each sealed tight each marked with an x loaded onto the vault elevator
if they meet anyone well blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault
a small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault elevator
its doors open to reveal the six large canvas bags each sealed tight marked with an x
one minute after that the elevator will rise to your cages
six of your guards will pick up the bags and carry them out into the casino
six guards do precisely that
moving with rusty past slot machines
if they take more than twenty seconds to reach the casino floor or if theres any indication a switch has been made well blow the money in the vault and
the money in the bags
a slot machine rings behind him
and benedict hears it
to walsh hes in the casino right now
of course im in the casino
in fact im staying in your hotel
and i have two words for you mini bar
back to business now as soon as your guards hit the casino floor
the six guards appear from the cage door carrying six canvas bags marked with xs bellagio security escorts them from the building
a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station
the white van now clean of the nevada telecom sign idles before the bellagio its windows tinted the drivers identity inscrutable
it is swarmed by security but they maintain a wide perimeter
your guards will load the bags into the vans rear
if anyone so much as approaches the drivers door we blow everything
the guards carry out the money and load it into the vans rear
there they find a video camera mounted within the back seat of the van monitoring them
still they cannot catch a glimpse of the driver
they close the van doors
the white van departs the valet station in front clandestinely shadowed by five sedans
meanwhile behind the casino a swat van arrives and unloads its squad
now when i get word that the van hasnt been followed that the money is secure my men will exit the building and once their safety is confirmed youll get
your vault back
walsh mouths to benedict swat team is here
benedict nods and throws him a thumbs up
sir i have complied with your every request would you agree
now i have one of my own
at last his venom released run and hide
if you get picked up next week buying a sports car in newport beach ill be supremely disappointed
because i want my people to find you
and rest assured when they do they wont hand you over to the police
beat run and hide
thats all i ask
and during the above rant by benedict we view
now empty livingstons monitors still displaying the masked men in the vault
navigating the streets of las vegas
tailing the van security goons piled into each and maybe we notice or maybe not the rolls royce tailing them
pacing in benedicts suite biting her nails debating whether to blow the whistle on danny
on tv a newscast of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight
bound and unarmed unconscious to the activity within the vault
opened and unmanned
listens the line has gone dead
he hangs up
our guys say the van is headed toward mccarren airport
get everyone in position
i want my vault back before that van hits the tarmac
longer montage now cutting between six in all hustling through the cage corridors armed to the teeth with body armor and helmets and vision guards theyre as faceless as storm
as it approaches mccarren airport
the three masked men pace beside the booby trapped money
on second inspection wheres zerga
off walshs sheepish look mr
with the briefcase
hes he died
benedict shoots him a slow sideways glance
rappelling down the elevator shaft its ultraviolet sensors turned off by walsh then moving into position
over radio on monitor night goggles on
prepare to cut power
fat mans the power switch
ready when you are
benedict scours the monitors the masked men continue to pace on one screen
the swat team prepares to invade on another
over radio cut it
fat flips the power switch
livingstons monitors all go black
the monitors here go black as well
benedict listens closely to the swat frequency
leaders voice first wave in
second wave now
there is running panting then linuss voice distant and panicked guys someones here
leaders voice take him down
a brief spurt of gunfire then
dead silence in the eye in the sky
slim stares deep into a monitors dark pitch
leaders voice lights
we need power now
fat flips the power back on and on the monitors
visions of destruction down below
smoke fills the vault as two swat members push through it
other swat members help evacuate the unconscious guards
into intercom whats the situation down there
they blew it
they blew the
if there was anyone in there theyre not in one piece anymore
to walsh soberly tell them to take the van
im going down there
as an afterthought to slim find out how they fiddled with our cameras
mccarren airport night as the white van arrives at a charter airlines entrance the five sedans converge upon it tires screeching goons emerging weapons drawn
get out of the van now
no response within the van
the head goon signals and the others shoot the vans tires
slim investigates the eye in the skys wiring
reaching deep into a mesh he finds a foreign object livingstons spider
the vault elevator doors open and terry benedict makes his way into his smoke filled vault corridor
he passes the uzi guards awake now and stumbling to the elevator with swat members assistance then arrives before his decimated vault anything within people money lyman zergas emeralds could
only have been destroyed
as he approaches benedict
we couldnt find any survivors
or im afraid any of your money
im sorry sir
doesnt want to hear anymore the swat team failed him take your men out now
hold on benedict seething as the swat leader steps away
okay guys grab your gear and clear out
into walkie talkie he has with him walsh how are we with the van
mccarren airport night the stalemate with the van continues
still no movement from inside
out of the van now
an employee from the charter airline sticks his head out of his office door
innocently hey whats going on here
half a dozen firearms turn and point in his direction
the employee disappears back inside his office
the head goon cautiously approaches the van reaches for the drivers door and yanks it open
inside there is no driver
just a video camera mounted at eye level
the head goon cranes back his head befuddled when he notices for the first time and maybe we do too an enormous antenna sprouting from the vans rear bumper
the van suddenly lurches
complete with a tiny video monitor displaying the van drivers pov and a steering mechanism its a near replica of the one virgil malloy used in the monster truck drag
race against his brother
and virgils using it now too as he sits next to reuben tishkoff in one of reubens rolls and watches the goons scramble back from the flat tired van
enough monkey business
virgil brings the van to a stop then readies a distinctive red button on his remote
as the head goon reaches for the rear door his hand inches away when
the door explodes open
knocked on his ass the head goon watches as the canvas x bags within burn to cinders
he does however happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged from a bag its a promotional flier for a call girl service
benedict steps over the scattered remains of his vault
he picks up a fragment of a cash cart burnt to a crisp then lets it drop
over walkie talkie mr
they took the van
hesitantly this is bad news and they blew up the bags sir
dropping his walkie talkie to his side shit
they say it doesnt look like there was any money in the bags sir
they say the bags were filled with fliers
what do you mean there was no money in the bags
thats what they said sir
i dont understand it we both saw them putting money inside those bags
benedict stops cold
he stares up at a wall where an engraved sign reading bellagio has been smoke stained
walsh cue up the tape of the robbery
walsh stands before several monitors as slim cues up the masked men robbing the vault image of a few minutes ago beside the present image of benedict staring at the
does it say bellagio on the south wall of the vault
in the masked men image it does not in fact say bellagio there
on walkie talkie no sir
i i dont understand
we had that installed on tuesday
the image we saw of the men robbing us was a tape
someone built a double of my vault then made a tape of them robbing it
when we saw them putting money in those bags that wasnt actually happening
walshs jaw drops as he watches the tape again
benedict is absolutely fucking furious
what happened to all the money
carried through the bellagio casino held by the swat leader leading his men out now eight in all and at last we pull up to see his face for the
its rusty in full regalia leading livingston turk saul frank basher yen and linus out of the casino each dressed as a swat member each carrying a duffel bag with
nearly million dollars inside
as we pass each man under the hum of the casino we see takes the call from walsh in the mirador suite as basher saul and frank dress behind him
dressed as a swat member hustles down a cage corridor
has trouble rappelling with the rest
takes position next to rusty at the elevator shafts bottom
theyre on camera but just a few feet away and off camera danny sits smiling
hiding his voice prepare to cut power
lights a short fuse leading into the vault
guys someones here
fires a spurt of blanks
no one is hurt
nor is the money stacked neatly in a corridor ready to be packed into the phony swat team bags body armor etc
the swat team exits and boards the second vehicle turk and virgil have been working on all this time the one in the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from
its rearview mirror its a replica of a swat van
turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back
rusty flips open another cell phone
las vegas p
this is officer brooks new jersey probation division
i have a violator in your jurisdiction
cupping phone hit it
turk hits the gas and the vehicle peels away carrying its cadre of new multi millionaires far away from the bellagio hotel and casino
benedict squats down to inspect a burnt scrap of paper on the vault floor
its a flier for a strip joint
and it finally occurs to him ocean
heated he approaches the interrogation room where his plainclothes goons keep watch
still inside sir
benedict straightens his cuffs cools himself then open that door
bruiser throws a mean left hook across dannys face as the door swings open and benedict steps in
bruiser sees him and steps away toweling off his bloodied knuckles
benedict studies danny the man is a bloody mess head rolling eyes puffed up
wake him up
the goons step in slap danny alert
at last danny recognizes benedict in the room
a little punchy heya benedict
hows the other fight going
benedict keeps his cool
did you have a hand in this
beat did you
did i have a hand in what
benedict scrutinizes danny is he bluffing
he looks at bruiser then danny again and decides no
get him out of here
as the goons scoop him up and drag him out danny catches bruisers eye for just a moment
and barely winks
the phone rings
tess plucks it up
if you must know its livingstons turn to channel
tess does so
on her tv a security angle of the cage hallway
the goons appear escorting bloodied danny out
as tess gasps we go live to
where benedict follows the goons and danny out brooding whats his next step
you get robbed or something benedict
geez thats a shame
benedict looks up suspicious
the goons stop spin danny around to face benedict
they hold each others eye
what would you say if i told you you could get your money back
beat if you gave up tess
beat what would you say
i would say yes
well thats very interesting
beat but i didnt have anything to do with it
to his goons escort mr
ocean to the exit
and contact the police
i would imagine mr
ocean is in violation of his parole
the goons haul danny out
tess has left heartbeats ago the rooms door is just closing
maybe we should have held him
takes in his casino
its been a bad night hes down a hundred fifty million
he starts for
as he arrives the elevator doors open and tess steps out
she breezes right past him
as she doesnt stop tess
you of all people should know terry in your hotel theres always someone watching
she keeps going
benedict now down a hundred fifty million and one woman boards the elevator
its doors close on him
the swat van rounds a corner and ducks inside the warehouse
three and a half seconds pass
and the eight swat members reappear now all in suits perfectly pressed and with grins on their faces and change in their pockets they begin their victory stroll single file
right down the
turk livingston frank basher yen saul linus and rusty march down the strip single file and when they come to an intersection
virgil and reuben also in suits fall into stride for a victory lap in front of the bellagio fountains
then one by one the group splinters off strolling into different hotels or grabbing cabs until there are only two left rusty and linus
they take each other in shake hands and part
tess exits searching for danny
she rounds the building to
where a lvpd squad car has just arrived to take goon held danny away
she runs toward it
as danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading in the back he and tess hold each others glance
beat im sorry
i knew what i was doing
a cop lowers dannys head as he directs him into his seat
how long will you be
shrug three to six months i should think
the squad car door closes him in and tess stands vigil as it pulls away
rusty watches danny being driven back to prison too
the great metal gate opens once more revealing danny ocean in its frame again ready for release
he looks forward no ones there to greet him and the view of new jersey looks no brighter than it did before
he takes his first step into free america
to discover rusty leaning against the prison wall
beyond him sits his second hand mercedes from l
looking for someone
thirteen million and you drive that piece of shit cross country to pick me up
hello to you too
they shakes hands
rusty looks danny over
your hairs grayer
your eyes got closer together
beat hows life
is a roomful of pillows
moving with danny and rusty toward the mercedes together again
where do you want to go first
to a phone
rusty had anticipated this
i stopped and picked up your personal effects put them in the back seat
danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see tess sitting in the back
she smiles at him
smiling back then im not sure these belong to me
sure they do
danny and rusty get in
danny kisses tess
rusty starts the car
we need to find rusty a girl
theres a womens prison just down the road
he drives off
in the back danny takes tesss hand in his
notices a silver wedding band on it
you said you sold this
thats what i said
as they drive away
another car starts its engine begins to follow
at the wheel benedicts goons
