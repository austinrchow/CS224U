burroughs waves as the girls roar off
as he looks down he spots an oil stain left by kimberlys suv
as he drags his shoe across the stain a slight breeze blows past his face
camera pushes in as a look of concern crosses his face
as she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp
a squeaky wheel is shrill and disturbing
drivers of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered face as she passes
up ahead waiting in line is kimberlys red suv

kimberly spins around startled
kimberly stares transfixed at the old woman who stares back with chilling intensity
the kids ad lib lets go and fucking freak
the old womans plastic bag breaks sending oranges rolling down the on ramp
the old woman breaks eye contact with kimberly as she rushes to retrieve them
the signal turns from red to flashing yellow
kimberly pulls the su v onto the highway looking in the side view mirror to see the old woman look up at her in slow mo

as she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic road sign that flashes warning construction next feet
kimberly merging into traffic nearly collides with a speeding yellow mini bus carrying a high school football team
kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right then realizing shes speeding towards the road construction barrels she swerves back left right behind the mini bus at the last moment
kimberly pulls around the mini bus as rowdy football players tackle each other yelling pile up
kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear highway to hell by ac dc at earsplitting volume
kimberly and shaina jump from the shock and reach to lower the volume
kimberly disturbed by this hits seek an oldies station
a grisly car crash from nervous norvus transfusion album
christ is this tribute to princess di day or what
kimberly passes a car weaving on her right
the driver reaching into the back seat to quiet a barking dog hanging on its head out the window
unnerved jesus all the crazies are out today
a cloud passes kimberlys head
she smells it and turns around taking her eyes off the road to see dano smoking a joint
i told you no drugs in the car

dano and frankie exchange looks god what a geek
laughs calm down kimmy
its not drugs just weed

kimberly turns to shaina helpless
shaina spins around her eyes wordlessly tell dano i know shes a priss but put it out
then kimberlys cell phone rings
she hits the speaker button
dano defiantly blows more smoke toward kimberly then breaks into an unexpected coughing fit looking over to see a hells angel laughing at hi m
the bikers trashy girlfriend also laughing quickly flashes her tits at dano over your cars leaking either transmission or brake fluid
i want you to have it checked asap at a gas station

kimberly passes a station wagon on her right the driver squinting at a map while driving
a mattress and some furniture tied to the top shift as the wagon hits a bump
um kimberly your dads not gonna call like every ten minutes is he
before kimberly can answer dano sees a chp speeding up behind him
he lowers the joint at once
hiding bag of weed in pants shit
theres a cop behind us
pull into the right lane now
kimberly scared does as shes told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs
a horn blasts
the truck swerves
then speeds by on the right
a coiled chain drops down to the highway
look first idiot
shaina turns up the radio and leans over to kimberly
one end of the rusty chain holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement sparking
looking in her rearview mirror kimberly turns pale the cop pulls in behind her
dano put that out now
dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window
it bounces on the windshield of a ford expedition to their left
kat very corporate america wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette
no im stuck on jury duty so i wont be able to pitch the campaign
lets get silverstein to come in and
kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers
a moment later a small flame crackles
what the hell
no not you
kat flicks on her windshield wiper fluid successfully putting out the joint but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around impairing her vision
kat turns and looks at dano dead serious all of a sudden
staring straight ahead
whats the cop doing
did he see that
kat sees the tailgating chp smiles then resumes her conversation
forget it ill call him myself
kat hangs up then looks down at her cell phone squints and dials a number
early s rookie cop who seems to have missed the entire exchange
thomas speaks into his radio
i was supposed to be off today
how did i get screwed
drake called in sick
switches off annoyed go on sleep it off drake
thomas tries to sip from a mcdonalds coffee cup on the dashboard but its too hot
he places it back on the dash
the vibrations of the road make the coffee cup slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard
dano nervously looks back
but kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard check engine light begins flickering
kimberly spots a road sign next service miles
this trip better be wor th it
whats the guy girl ratio again
get ready to smile five guys per girl
i can live with thaaaa kimberly stops mid sentence when the white van in front of her suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder for no reason
kimberly screams swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident
frankie instinctively shouts at the van
whats your problem ya fuckin crack baby
isabella cruz late s and very pregnant drives a delivery van full of funeral wreaths crosses and classic rose urns
most are marked in memory of flight
she chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over
couldnt keep your dick in check for another month
i knew this would happen when i got pregnant
she pounds the steering wheel furious
whatd the doctor say
i have to come in to test for stds
goddamn you jorge
a crate in the back of her van topples over and crashes and a flurry of sunflower petals sails out the window
isabella jumps in surprise and wiping tears from her eyes rolls up the windows as petals shower the visor of eugene the harley rider who smears the petals and some
squashed bugs around his visor and drops back
kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a truck driver guzzling from a flask as it passes the suv revealing its side is an
ad for firestone tires
it finally clears frame revealing a highway billboard that reads kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat
up ahead the rusty chain seems to have more give to it
logs strain against it
suddenly a black cloud of exhaust from a blue chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows
oil drips from its rusty exhaust pipe
the thick exhaust blinds kimberly
gas it around these idiots
we do have miles to go you know
kimberly tires to enter the passing lane but shes blocked by a suburu wagon
in the front seat a seven year old kid is sadistically smashing two toy cars together
kimberly passes the suburu and pulls up to a pacer
the harley roars by startling her
nora kesner and her son tim
tim drums on the dashboard with two ten ounce naya bottles
tim will you cut that out
i cant even hear myself think
tim frowns and then winces holding his jaw
damn it really hurts mom
i know well be there soon
tim drops the naya bottles on the seat
one of them quietly falls to the floor rolls a bit finally settling under the brake pedal
kimberly is still behind the smoke spewing chevette
she passes it on the left
frankie rolls down his window
yells to driver ever hear of the ozone layer asshole
rory leans down to snort a line of coke off a def leppard cd case
s he looks up to see the patrol car is now behind him he reflexively taps the brakes
rory eyes like saucers sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and nonchalantly wipes the cd clean on his pants
she has dropped back behind the chevette and chp car and is running down along side of a black trans am
up ahead she sees the hig hway patrol car flick on its lights and pull into the shoulder around the chevette and behind the semi loaded with logs
as thomas pulls in behind the log truck his coffee cup lurches forward spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor
son of a bitch
its driver evan schaeffer flashes a cocky smile at kimberly clearly making frankie jealous
a trans am
that shit went out with new kids on the block
who does he think he is
laughs then who
frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on evans window
you know hasselhoff before he did baywatch
evan pissed off flips off frankie
the windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid
the sun blinding him
whats the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona
how does a nice mature fuck sound
kimberly laughs then leans in close to shaina
hey thanks for talking me into this trip
ever since my mom
i dunno i just feel like im starting to live again you know
shaina smiles in understanding
thomas bends to wipe up the mess
he only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee
suddenly up ahead the rusty chain snaps
the logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway
one bounces as it hits and slams through thomas front winshield and out the back taking thomas head with it
eugene slams on his brakes
his harley slides out and he is slammed to the ground sliding at miles per hour across the highway right in front of the yellow mini bus
the mini bus driver brakes to avoid eugene
the football players tumble forward and hit him in the head
he loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median
he blows a front tire and the mini bus begins to flip rolling several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic and is hit by a eugene slides into
a huge log and hits it with a sickening crunch
only to be hit and crushed by his sliding motorcycle
rory looks up too late and rear ends thomas car exploding the gas tank and hurling rorys dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in half onto
kat dialing looks up slams on her brakes but skids on oil from the chevette
she swerves into kimberly side swipes her then swerves to miss a huge log only to run head on into two more flipping the expedition end over end right next
kimberly swerves back from being hit by kat just in time to see a huge log ahead
she tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it but hits it broadside sending the suv flipping over the top of the log and sliding down the road
inside shaina dano and frankie are tossed around like rag dolls shredded by glass and shrapnel frankie is ejected out the side window
kimberlys suv slides to a stop on its side
she looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen naya
bottle prevents her from braking and she slams into the back of kats expedition
the crash test dummy collision folds her pacer and it explodes into a huge fireball
evan blinded by the smeared windshield is too late
he swerves his trans am around the burning cars onto the wet grass
kimberly sees the topless trans am slowly roll out of a huge wall of fire and coast to a stop
evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive
he is trapped in his burning car screaming and trying to release the seatbelt
then just when she thought it was over a huge semi slides thro ugh the wall of fire smashing the trans am out of the way spinning it like a
with the back sliding at degrees it keeps on coming
the semis grill comes right at her
she screams and we sweating profusely kimberlys eyes dart around taking in her surroundings

the old woman bumps the window scaring the shit out of everyone

kimberly stares in horror as the old woman flashes an evil grin
kimberlys eyes lower to the bag of oranges which breaks exactly like before and the old woman scurries after them
the signal turns from red to flashing yellow
dano shouldnt we stop and help your mother
yellow means go kimberly
kimberly hyperventilates in the drivers seat
a yellow mini bus with football players speeds past

dano hums the twilight zone theme
my turn to drive
the drivers behind them start leaning on their horns
kimberly leans out the window and sees the chevette the pacer the white van the trans am the harley
all the familiar vehicles from the pile up
she turns on the radio frantically scans the dial
relax you need to chill the fuck out
highway to hell highway to hell
for christ sakes girl take a breath
taking you into an all request weekend with a classic from ac dc
the opening guitar riff to highway to hell blares from the speakers
kimberly turns to shaina with a believe me know
look but shainas nowhere near on the same page
honking behind them
kimberly shaking like a leaf pulls the suv forwards turning it sideways to block off all traffic
what the hell are you doing
dano shifts in his seat and sees a highway pat rol car ominously cruising up the shoulder of the onramp
he shoves a bag of weed along with the joint down his pants
five os coming
lets fucking roll man
officer thomas burke stops the car behind them
here he comes
well all die if we do
the cop turns on his flashers
i told you shed ruin everything
shut up dano just stay cool
to kimberly hes just stoned
officer thomas burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side of the suv hand on weapon
thomas taps the window with his knuckle
whats going on here
incoherent through tears theres going to be a pile up
i saw it happen
thomas looks to the guys in back who shrug we dont know her
miss please step out of the vehicle
as she does thomas discretely unsnaps his holster
rory nervously eyes the action
sneaks a paper bundle into his sock
isabella the pregnant woman in the white van gets out
she gives thomas her friendliest smile milking the pregnant belly
excuse me but is there some way we could just drive around
i have a delivery
her cell phone rings and she leans back inside to answer it
hey hon you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from planned parenthood
whats going on
as she listens growing agitated the harley rider dismounts and pulls off his helmet
revealing eugene dix a nebbishy school teacher in cool leathers
nora watches the suv distressed
what on earth are they doing
picking up two naya bottles who am i david blane
nora gives tim a hard stare then they both break into smiles
nora tousles his hair
and doesnt stop
good natured laughter okay quit it already
as he laughs something pains his jaw and he winces
thomas isnt quite sure what kind of insanity hes dealing with yet
dano and frankie no help stare dead ahead
trying to calm herself the radio played the same songs the old ladys bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition
kimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the log truck speed past
she grabs at thomas for emphasis
thats the truck thats going to kill everyone
alright miss calm down
i just need this lane open
i need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder
youre not listening to me
you have to do something
evan impatiently yells out the window of his trans am
arrest this whack job wouldja
some of us have lives yknow
kimberly looks to shaina for support but even shaina cant meet her eyes
why wont anyone listen to me
thomas subtly reaching for his cuffs
im not going to tell you to calm down again a series of crashes and explosions are heard
in the distance
kimberlys face crumbles
she screams in horror and collapses against the suv
thomas runs to his patrol car
the white delivery van makes a j turn out of the line of cars and speeds down the onramp in reverse isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone
you couldnt keep your dick in check for a month
the other drivers exit their cars craning their necks to see whats happened up ahead
kat takes a deep drag off her smoke
great now im really gonna be late
thomas barks into the radio handset l
i need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major t
at frankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars brake hard
shaina anxiously watches kimberly pacing behind the kimberly whats going on
kimberly moves toward shainas window
as she leans her head into shainas window an ominous breeze blows back their hair and we hear the blaring horn of a truck
and kimberly is unexpectedly yanked backward by thomas
from nowhere a shriek of brakes as a jack knifed truck plow s the suv across the frame
flying debris misses kimberly and thomas by inches
kimberly cries in horror into thomas shoulder as her friends burn up in the wreckage
evan the driver of the trans am impatiently speaks to detective suby late s professional with an open face that makes him a great listener
i dont know what you want from me
some crazy chic k blocks the highway with her car said thered be an accident and there was
even a broken watch is right twice a day
officer thomas burke passes by heading into kat eugene nora tim and rory sit in a large room waiting to give statements
unlike evan these witnesses are clearly distraught
not to sound insensitive but how much longer is this going to take
if i dont get back to my classroom soon the kidsll tear the room apart
those poor people
to think it wouldve been us if not for
pan over to reveal kimberly
shes still in shock her mind far away
thomas sits close to her speaking softly
tell me again how it started
like i said it was like i was there
i remember everything
the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shainas face
do you remember what triggered it all
the log truck
and everybody i guess
everyone was driving like a maniac
and somehow i knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did
something clicks for thomas but he forces himself to speak calmly like a lawyer leading a friendly witness
you just mean a hunch right
a bad vibe maybe
the other drivers stare at kimberly
more than that
all the songs on the radio were about car crashes
some kids banging toy cars together
lookin g at her she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on
points to rory his car was leaking oil all over the road
hey dont be knockin the chevette
but the others listen intently now
especially kat who spies her headset buried deep in her purse
billboards about accidents
kids yelling pile up for no reason
it all felt
swallows hesitates like what
kimberly sighs and looks down
the room becomes eerily silent except for the flicker of a florescent light
i know this sounds crazy
but you all heard about flight right
the kid who got off the plane
thomas eyes widen then a startling crash as rory le aning back in his chair tips over
thomas rolls his eyes as rory grins sheepishly and picks himself up
you mean alex browning
looking down my premonition was just like his
what are you talking about
sarcastic oh you must have read about that kid who had a dream about a plane crash so he got his buddies off the plane
then the thing blew up just like in the dream
eugene sees nora and tim are hooked and speaks in scary campfire tones
but this is where it starts to get freaky
so a month goes by everything seems cool but then the survivors start dying one boy one
cause when your numbers up its up right
some people said death itself started coming for them hunting down every last one until they were all dead
everyone tenses up
well not quite all of them
clear rivers checked herself into a padded room at stoneybrook
kimberly affected looks to thomas for confirmation
you do believe me dont you
everyone jumps as detective suby pounds on the door and opens it
could i see you in here
the door opens
detective suby enters leading thomas
through a two way mirror they can see the others chatting anxiously
tell me you didnt start up on that flight shit again
beat did you
of course not
that would be irresponsible and unprofessional
detective subys persistent glare makes thomas uncomfortable
look you werent there
it was weird
she knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident she knew
beat never mind
i thought we we re finished with this bullshit
this is police work not the psychic hot line
but thomas isnt listening
hes glued to kimberlys words
when detective suby realizes this he stops and listens
but if i was never meant to pull over then we all should have died in the pile up
which means death could be coming for us
detective suby looks pissed o ff
way to console the witnesses burke
at the same time we watch evan enter the other room grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others
you got em thinking death is after them
shit theyre the luckiest sons o bitches on the planet
get this guy evan shaeffer yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years
i should be so damn unlucky
kimberly nora tim kat eugene and rory now seem affected by what theyve heard
what if its true
what if its happening all over again
the fluorescent light above flickers ominously
nora disturbed stands up in a huff grabbing tims arm
youre all certifiable you know that
i cant believe ive been listening to this crap
come on tim lets go outside
jeez mom stop trippin
look lady were just yankin your chain
yeah youre acting like we all just got the diffrent strokes curse or something
eugene and rory burst out laughin g
nora shakes her head disgusted
whats wrong with you people
nora pulls a reluctant tim out of the room
as she opens the door the others watch detective suby and thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down
when the door swings shut an awkward silence
suddenly the door opens again and thomas leads mr
burroughs sees kimberly and chokes back tears
the sight of her fath er crying is enough to make kimberlys own dam burst
she rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest sobbing
can i take her home
sure you can all go
by now the fluorescent light flickers out of control
when rory kat and eugene stand up thomas looks helpless
first im stuck with jury duty now this nonsense
yeah i hate to love and leave ya but ive been over this x files shit since the sixth season
as thomas watches them file out the fluorescent light pops
then kimberly sits at the table
burroughs sets down a cup of tea before her
both are shaken
i know its crazy but im really scared for the others
ive got this terrible feeling
that its not over yet
she picks up the tea it clatters in her trembling hands
don t worry
everything will be fine youll see
a dingy singly light bulb illuminates the narrow stairwell
evan appears in the darkness carrying a brand new television with some packages on top
hes unable to s ee the long rickety stairwell he climbs
the stairs are littered with chinese take out menus and a tonka truck apparently left by some kids
as evan slowly climbs the staircase a fat man comes down forcing evan to lean against the railing which creaks and bends
after the fat man passes evan slowly continues up again tearing his shirt on a nail
a heating duct clicks on
the air blows a tonka truck slowly toward the center of the staircase directly in evans path but evan just misses it
he continues past more toys nearing the top stair the airduct coughs sending menus fluttering toward evans feet and he slips on them
he juggles the tv but ultimately rights himself and continues down the hallway
dim cheap probably roach infested
as evan enters the small packages fall off the tv box and onto the floor
evan places the tv by the door looks at his torn shirt but fuck it who cares hes on a natural high
he peels his shirt off revealing his pierced nipples flicks on the radio and dances his way over to the fridge and grabs a drink
in the tiny kitchenette area a small swarm of flies hovers over a grease filled frying pan
evan recoils throws open the window and throws the grease to the sidewalk five stories below
an ominous breeze enters and a kitchen cabinet slowly blows open
some forks and knives slide forward on poorly stacked plates
daring to fall into the toaster
evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the frying pan then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks
evan puts the frying pan on the stove and turns it on high
he then grabs a container of chinese food and rests it on the counter next to the fridge
on the fridge several colorful magnets spell out push in on the h which mysteriously drops into the chinese food the word ey e remaining
oblivious evan puts the food in the microwave and turns it on
the cooki ng oil creeps toward the range
evan hits play on his answering machine and rushes across the room to tear open his packages
you buy one fucking ticket in your whole life and win twenty grand
were going whoring in prague you know this
whisper hold on the boss is coming
a click then hold muzak ac dcs highway to hell
angle on magnet in chinese fo od
it pops and fizzles
and ugly sound
as many similar messages continue evan unwraps a new rolex
he slides it over his wrist admiring it
lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster protruding about an inch and a half
by now evan has opened the next package a gaudy gold and diamond encrusted horseshoe ring
he carries the ring into the kitchenette sees the chinese food is flaming and his hands flash out to turn it off a small explosion from the microwave startles him
the ring falls into his drain garbage disposal
evan reaches into the drain his fingers searching for the ring
when he tries to pull his hand back out the rolex catches
another small explosion from the microwave this one cracking the glass
a solo plastic cup nearby begins to melt
flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan
in moments the oil from the pan ignites
a small fire
evan sees all this and yanks with all his might
as the fire slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes evan starts to panic
he continues yanking
he sees a bottle of palmolive on the other end of the counter
his fingers reach for it
slightly out of his grasp
but his fingertips are just long enough to knock the bottle backwards where it rests against two switches
the fire alarm goes off
the phone rings
evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the palmolive over
by pushing the bottle up against the wall it threatens to turn on one of the switches
in the garbage disposal
a switch is flipped but the light goes on
and the palmolive lazily falls resting on the remaining switch
come on come on
evan makes one last push with his foot accidently flipping the switch the garbage disposal grinds metal
evan horrified miraculously yanks his hand free brushing against the knife in the toaster
when the shock goes through evans body his other hand jerks out knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor
the entire kitchen is in flames including the new tv blocking the door
the window slams shut
the room fills with smoke
evan grabs a fire extinguisher
a mere dribble of foam comes out
he begins coughing in the smoke
evan tries the window stuck
he has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape
he dr ops the fire extinguisher starts to climb out the window hears a creak and looks up just as a large jagged shard of glass comes crashing down at
him evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him
the fire completely engulfs the kitchen
he bravely jumps through the window pane landing on the fire escape
he runs down the fire escape from floor to floor
a large blast from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel but ultimately he makes it to the fire escapes lowest level intact
he tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground
it budges once then twice but wont go down
so he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground
safe and sound he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk suddenly he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window his legs shoot out
from under him and he lands on his back
the rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward coming right for evans face but stops halfway
as evan laughs breathing a final sigh of relief it suddenly plummets again impaling evan through his eye socket
thomas sits at the computer terminal
he checks to make sure no ones watching as he enters a search for alex browning
ten websites come up all devoted to the flight curse
thomas scrolls around seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of flight survivors
headlines blare freak accident
describing the way the victims died
as thomas begins a localized search of the word premonition spooky humming from behind him
thomas whirls around to see det
suby looking over his shoulder humming the music from an old monster movie
suby presses one hand to his forehead the other polishing an apple against his vest
as if entranced ooooh i see it now
a transfer to another department
suby bites the apple casually offering nothing more
thomas embarrassed flicks off the computer stands
youve made your point
cause we just got some new info and i dont ne ed you getting freaky on me
evan shaeffers dead
guess he wasnt as lucky as we thought
detective suby shrugs and walks away munching the apple
thomas looks stunned
kat cradles a phone to her shoulder
she watches television and crushes oreos into a bowl of ice cream
just turn on any station theyve been playing it all day
beat rolls her eyes yes mother
channel four will do just fine
here it is gotta go
she hangs up the phone mesmerized by the report footage from a helicopter shows the pile up wreckage
route was backed up for almost nine hours today when a record breaking pile up
nora and tim watch the same report
killed an estimated people
emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage
eugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch
hoping to recover any survivors from this tragic collision
so far the police are refusing to release the names of the victims until their families are notified
burroughs numbly watches the same report
he doesnt see kimberly enter behind him from the kitchen
the camera of a highway patrol car managed to catch this shocking footage b w camera footage from thomas car shows thomas tackling kimberly to the ground just as a
jack knifed truck plows into the suv
a gasp from behind him
burroughs spins to see kimberly fighting back tears and picks up the remote prepared to click of the tv but she stops him
i have to see this
burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on
its a party
rory surrounded by buddies shakes a triumphant fist at the television
he whoops with delight spilling popcorn everywhere
you see that shit
thats my fuckin car right there
oh god thats dope
after high fiving his peeps he bends to table level and snorts a freshly chopped line
in other news a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner
rory looks up to see the dmv photo of evan
as he takes in the report his mood radically shifts
he looks like hes been hit by a train
of kimberly nora tim eugene and kat watching
they all take the news very hard as the footage shows evans body being carried away by emt workers
eugene however shakes his head sadly but goes back to grading blue books
tims eyes are glued to the latest stephen king novel
nora peers in
come on tim lights out already
tim starts at her voice then reluctantly puts down the book
you think those guys were b
ing us today or what
nora swallows trying to seem brave
some people just need some serious rewiring thats all
but neither of them are convinced
get some sleep
nora kisses his forehead and leaves the room
after she leaves tim opens his nightstand drawer pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in
nora closes her bedroom door
and locks it
she nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds
finally she takes out a business card and dials a number
she hangs up then dials again
officer burke please
burroughs tucks a still shaken kimberly into bed
in one of his hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch
its okay dad
im not ten anymore
burroughs catches himself being overprotective
im just so happy that youre safe
i love you too dad
burroughs isnt ready to leave
he finishes his drink
you know after your mother died
kimberly tenses bracing for the worst
there were so many times i didnt think i could last another day
i cant even tell you some of the things i th ought about
i used to have those feelings too
but thats when id think of mom
and id pray that maybe id grow up to be as brave as she was
and the bad thoughts would go away
choking up i dont know what id do if i lost you
burroughs leans over kisses her forehead and leaves
just as hes out the door he braces at the distant sound of a car skidding out of control
the endless screech is nerve shattering
burroughs stands frozen tensing for the inevitable crunch
but there is none
and he leaves
the room is dark except for one burning candle
kimberly tosses and turns
the wind sends a single branch scraping against her window
a porch swing squeaks back and forth
adding to her anxiety
a breeze enters sputtering out the candle
kimberly sits upright in bed and sees the window is shut
she lights a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table forming the gooey shape of a
the match goes out in her hand
the room is dark again
headlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling
shadows resembling planes seem to transform into a skull
kimberly freaked out looks around to see the blinking light from the vcr it flashes a few times then
she cant take it anymore
she yanks the vcr cord from the wall and flicks on the lights ridding the room of shadows
and anxiously turns on her computer
kimberly drives a beat up hyundai through an eerie morning mist that surrounds the grounds of the stoneybrook hospital
a computer printout in the shotgun seat mapquest directions to stoneybrook hospital
as kimberly drives through the gate the mist almost seems to follow her inside
a sign offers a choice between emergency medica l care or psychiatric treatment center
kimberly drives to the mental ward
a physician in a lab coat leads a nervous kimberly down the center of a long corridor
the physician consults a clipboard
at the request of the patient you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files pencils pens safety pins bobby pins no matches lighters belts belt buckles earrings
kimberly watches carefully as the physician comes to a door and punches into the electronic lock
they continue down another corridor
lights flicker patients cackle and moan in the b
paper clips watches food drinks keys poisons pills and medications
looks at kimberly you have a cell phone on you
kimberly nods hands it over
then i think were all done
they arrive at a door to a padded room
the physician punches in another code
dangerous or something
no honey but she expects you are
jesus how long are you going to keep her locked up this way
depends on her i guess
the door hisses open
while still beautiful this young woman bears few traces of her former self
her eyes dart around suspiciously maddened by chronic paranoia
her hair is patchy her eyes dark and haunted
bordering on savage
her movements are fidgety erratic always distracted by something unseen
clear looks kimberly up and down and steps back allowing her inside her inner sanctum
a mattress on the floor a plastic bottle of water some paperbacks and a bedpan
kimberlys jaw drops when she sees the far wall a shrine to flight
the wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors as seen in the opening title montage
the door slams
kimberly burroughs eh
what do you want
i thought you might be able to help me
snicker yeah how
i had a premonition about the route pile up
i saved some people
and now i think death is after me
maybe if youre real lucky youll wind up in here with me
gives kimberly the once over but i doubt youll survive that long
its not just about me
someone i saved died last night in a freak accident
what if the others are in danger too
well if you put them on the list theyre already tits up
the precise order youre going to die in
clears eyes bore into a terrified kimberlys
the survivors of flight died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash
that was deaths original design
sudden realization exact order
then im next
i was meant to die with my friends so im next
clear backs away from kimberly as if she were lethal then stops short
but you said someone else died last night
that means death skipped past you
someone must have intervened
off kimberlys confusion sometime yesterday you must have nearly died but someone saved you
kimberly nods recalling the events
officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends
that makes you last to go
but dont worry once the others are dead itll come back for you
that still doesnt make sense
you said you die in the same order you were originally meant to
but evan shaeffer died last in my premonition not first
clear seems very disturbed by that
its moving backwards
are you sure
kimberly reluctantly strains to remember something
noras pacer folds like an accordion then explodes followed by evan screaming in the trans am which gets creamed by the semi
kimberly shaken does the math
in my premonition that nora woman and her kid died first then evan and then
clear is oblivious when kimberly breaks into silent sobs
clear sees kimberly crying and softens
get all your tears out now youll need your eyes
off kimberlys confusion for the signs
if you have the same power as alex youll be seeing signs soon
when you see anything creepy or ominous an in your face irony kinda thing
dont ignore it
it usually means the difference between life and death
to herself the songs on the radio
to clear but wait
i dont understand
why is this even happening to me
thats what alex used to ask himself right up until
for an instant we see a gentle side of clear
its obvious you know what youre talking about
you beat it
you have to help us
clear suddenly toughens up an abrupt mood shift
i didnt beat it i hid from it
if you were smart youd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you
dont make new friends dont fall in love and dont ever bother trying to save others
thats the worst killer of them all
how can you say that
what kind of monster are you
at once clear enraged is in her face speaking through clenched teeth
my family is dead
my friends are dead
clear angrily peels a polaroid off the wall and shows it to kimberly
while we dont see the photo kimberlys horrified face paints a gruesome picture on its own
and yes thats the blade of a fucking ceiling fan in his head
clear pounds on the door apparently done with kimberly
a guard opens the door
kimberly devastated turns to leave then summons her courage and turns back to clear
i think youre a coward
i think you hide out in here because youre too damn bitter and selfish to care about another living soul
in my opinion youre already dead
kimberly leaves giving clear something to think about
as kimberly pulls into her driveway shes surprised to see a strange car parked there
then thomas wearing street clothes peers through the front window of the house
he guiltily backs away as kimberly gets out
i tried calling last night but your father evan shaeffers dead
thoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect the sky behind them
ive gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp
were all meeting at my apartment tonight
then you believe all this
that death is working off a list
thomas hesitates before answering
until i was dispatched to clean up one of the flight survivors
suddenly through the reflection of the window glass kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once
like a scene out of the birds kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle
but when kimberly turns away from the reflection toward the actual pigeons theyre gone
all in her head
did you see that
thomas concerned for her saw nothing
its a sign
if clears right about the order then nora and tim are going to be attacke d by pigeons
im not following you theyre next on the list
we have to find them
womans n ike shoe on a down moving escalator
reveal nora taking her son tim to a dentists office
the shoelace snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels untying it
mischievous smile you think the tooth fairys gonna come tonight
im thinkin like fifteen bucks
nice try kiddo
tim smiles then winces from the pain in his mouth
the dangling shoelace heads straight for the escalator grate
it gets swallowed up
as tim steps off nora trips forward
her caught sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase
tim watches helplessly as nora reaches down tug ging at her sneaker fear mounting
tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks
finally the shoelace snaps and noras free again
nora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the stubby one
lets shake it were late
the wind picks up as they continue past a who apply industrial suction cups to large thick sheets of plated tim stares in childlike fascination as they pass jackhammers a
cement mixer and an excavator
clear rivers applies fun tack to the back of a newspaper article and sticks it on the wall devoted to flight
a photo of eva lotto winner killed by ladder
clear backs away pausing to look at a group photo of the survivors of flight just before take off
not so much
lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself
the receptionist appears next to the fallen fish food with a vacuum
she plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank
a startling grind as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail
she vacuums up the fish food around noras feet
the dead fish gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which sputters and stops
the water level rises spilling water over the side of the tank
the water trickles closer to the outlet
thomas drives his car into a friendly neighborhood
kimberly riding shotgun hangs up her cell phone
the cleaning woman said theyre at the dentists
th and main
thomas expertly skids into a u turn
tim looks petrified as dr
lees unveils a tray full of pics carvers and extracting forceps
the ka chung of construction outside makes it im possible to concentrate but hands trembling slightly dr
lees picks up a pic and mirror and starts examining tims mouth
cu of pic gently prodding tims teeth
im a little disappointed tim
does your mom know youve been smoking
tim groans uh uh then suddenly flinches
yeah thatll have to be filled
a bang from the window startles dr
his hand jerks but luckily the pic was removed from tims mouth
lees whips around in time to see a pigeon flutter away from the window
every day at the same damn time
now thisll only sting for a moment
lees picks up a large syringe and moves it toward tims open mouth
tims eyes radiate fear
the mouth opens
tim nervously eyes the window as the needle enters
needle heading toward his gumline bang
another pigeon takes a header into the reflection
lees hand jerks nearly jabbing tims tongue
tim squirms violently
lees looks towards the window angrily
how the hell do they expect me to
would you rather have the laughing gas
tim nods his head ferociously
i need you in here
jean continues vacuuming
the vacuum makes contact with noras foot
after a minute dr
lees angrily switches on two compressors oxygen and nitrous oxide
by now the no mask has been attached around tims nose
as tim drifts off dr
lees lowers a drill into his mouth
excruciating sounds of the drill going through enamel
racing to the medical complex throughout
the water trickles into the outlet
the vacuum sparks and dies just as bang
sfx broken glass it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed through the window
in the other room
goddamn it already
lees marches out of the room to investigate
another quick electrical surge and the oxygen compressor flutters off
the needle drops
but the nitrous flow remains strong
spinning from a new breeze
suddenly a small round puffer fish falls directly into tims mouth
soft gurgling and choking
nora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly right
lees makes a half hearted attempt to soothe and catch it
slow dolly up to tim
his eyes are open but rolled up
his hand limply reaches up
sounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our slow dolly into tims eyes
they glaze over
the choking stops
and a hand reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of tims mouth
reveal jean looking petrified at the close call looking around to make sure nobody saw
nora and tim feeling better now walk past the construction crew
a crane operator smiles at tim who smiles back
from across the mall the tiny running figures of kimberly and thomas appear in the dis tance pointing and screaming
what are they doing here
and why are they yelling pigeons
just then tim and nora walk into a large cluster of pigeons who suddenly burst into flight startling the crane operator whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever a metallic chain
rattle fills the air and tim looks up just as a huge sheet of glass plummets downward toward him and crushes him his mangled body visible underneath
as two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk nora screams
emergency vehicles everywhere
thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to kimberly who stands by his car
in the bg emts load a stretcher into an ambulance
shaking his head noras not coming
she refuses to leave her son
we have to tell her shes in danger
sadly i did
and right now i dont think she cares
thomas car turns into the driveway and parks
kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble
its happening again
its fucking happening again
i hoped wed get there and theyd be okay that clear rivers was full of shit and evans death was just a freak accident
thomas kills the engine to listen
but were all going to die
we cant stop it
its just a matter of time
im so scared
thomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly
i am too
but you can use that fear
itll sharpen your instincts
keep you alert fro signs
its the only way youll be able to sav e the others
kimberly seeming overwhelmed pulls her hand back
thomas senses hes losing her and softens her approach
i know you didnt ask for any of this kimberly
but i dont think you have it in you to quit either
kimberly stares straight ahead the weight of the world sinking in
a startling pound on the roof of thomas car
kimberly jumps then spins around to see clear rivers standing in the driveway
a determined powerful presence
kimberly exits the car
a moment where kimberly and clear stare each other down
clear nods absently to thomas still focused on kimberly
bitter the second one just dies
a year old kid
nods a faint trace of guilt i hope youre ready for this
thomas car pulls into a partially filled parking lot
kimberly thomas and clear file out and head to the door
this is cheery
who is this guy anyway
he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us
should we knock
looking ill he probably already knows were coming
kimberly thomas and clear open the large wooden doors into a small chapel creat ing a loud creak
a corpse in an open casket sits at the front of the chapel post wake
kimberly thomas and clear are forced to walk around the dead body to get to a side door
the three slowly edge towards a room at the end of a creepy hallway
an orange glow flickers from the far room
the unmistakable sounds of a furnace make it all the more eerie
as they near the door theyre able to see inside the room the shadow of a figure looms against a steel oven
they edge closer
they peek inside the oddly there is no one there
as they enter passing the furnace a momentary whoosh of flames startles them all
they jump back bumping right into mr
bludworth the dark sinister mortician from fd who has inexplicably appear behind them
ive been keeping an eye out for you
the mortician rolls a metal gurney carrying evans eyeless body toward the firing oven
kimberly and thomas are scared
oh my god
thats evan shaeffer
clear however seems to expect nothing less
pick my brain
the mortician slides a gleaming set of medical pliers into evans mouth
and yanks out a gold tooth
kimberly recoils as he discards the bloody tooth on a metal tray
to kimberly flesh and bone require degrees for cremation
gold prosthetics and other metals must be removed before the final not falling for this again just a simple question and well leave you alone with your new friend
the mortician grins he likes the new clear
he crosses the room and hits a lever
the oven begins to blaze
how do you cheat death once and for all
the mortician recrossing the room passes kimberly and stoops down to sniff no inhale a terrified kimberlys essence
but still fresh
kimberly shudders as the mortician moves back to evans body
clear has had about enough
to the mortician look we drove a long way to get here
so if you happen to know how to get this death monkey off our backs it sure would be swell if you told us
the mortician now clamps the pliers around evans nipple ring
for what purpose
you seek a back way out of a room with but one door
you cant cheat death there are no escapes
you told me death has a distinct design a blueprint unalterable
but alex and i cheated death not once but dozens of times
if the design is flawed it can be beaten
a sick smile crosses the morticians lips
he yanks the nipple ring off
kimberly looks on both horrified and awed when clear doesnt flinch back from the pliers where a bloody nub dangles
such fire in you now
people are always most alive just before they die
dont you think
clear steps back from him hate flashing in her eyes
it can be beaten
and you know it
the mortician rolls evans body into the oven
some say that there is a balance to everything
an equilibrium that is the connective tissue of the universe
they say that for every lif e there is a death and for every death a life
his words hang in the air
an ominous breeze enters
solus novus anima licet evinco mortis only new life can defeat death
off their confusion the list of life is forever set by the divine plan the guiding hand that plots the course of the universe down to its tiniest element s
thomas looks to clear whats he talking about
the mortician focuses on kimberly as if the others had ceased to exist
the list accounts for every life from the dawn of man to the great apocalypse
but the introduction of life that was not meant to be a soul forbidden to roam the earth that could invalidate deaths list shatter its very existence
evans other eye pops startling thomas and kimberly
what the hell does that mean
with finality to figure that out youll have to follow the sign s
the mortician grabs kimberly
but be warned
to disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe
when you pull all the threads apart you may find yourself hanging from them
the mortician finally lets kimberly go
one last question
why is death working backwards this time
the mortician glances at his watch evans bran d new rolex
shakes head a sick smile sorry times up
from the nozzle in thomas car
thomas fills the tank watching for signs of danger
clears hand is poised over the gas pumps emergency some skate rats exit the mini mart with a pack of camels followed by kimberly who carries a couple of red
bulls and hands them out
new life defeats death
follow the signs
where the hell did you find that guy
yeah i thought he was supposed to be helpful
if we can use your ability to see the signs we can cheat death long enough to figure out what new life means
off their looks i know it worries me that i understand him
thomas tops off the tank
some gas spills to the ground
quick looks all around sure enough one of the skate rats is about to strike a match
clears hand slaps the kid in the back of the head stopping him mid motion
what the fuck are you thinking
the startled skate rat shrinks back from clears rage
im thinkin suck my junk bee yatch
thomas chuckles to himself and looks at kimberly who pov driver
grease covered female hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control toward a lake
the van crashes through a railing and plunges into the water
in moments the van fills with water the driver inside trapped
comes to thomas arms gasping uncontrollably for breath
she begins hyperventilating
what is it
what did you see
its so bad kimberly cant speak
she coughs and gags as if recently drowned
clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers
on a cherry picker messes with the transformer a lawn boy pull starts a weed whacker close to broken glass a mechanic on a tall ladder changes out the gas
price numbers a female dog walker with three dogs approaches the ladder
you have to tell us now
clear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an angry drill sergeant
do you hear me
youre a fucking warrior
nothing scares you
in fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth
now what did you see
the words slowly take affect
kimberly becomes centered getting her breath back and speaks without a hitch
i was driving a white van
it mustve gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned
you were there
i can practically taste the water in my throat
and something else
the smell of flowers
confused then it wasnt just a sign
it was a premonition
thomas gently releases her paces
remember the onramp
there was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van
he said only new life can defeat death
off looks if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born a brand new soul that was never part of deaths design
it throws the entire death list out of whack
and a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch
we all start over with a clean slate
it sounds all well and good but what if were wrong
please what else could it mean
to thomas so if you give us the pregnant ladys number we can warn her about the lake and shell live long enough to have the baby
so lets do it
realization shit i dont have her number
she was never interviewed
she took off right after the accident
how are we going to find her
there must be thousands of white vans in this state
hey im a police officer remember
thomas works a vcr scanning backwards through the video footage from the patrol car camera
we see the suvs explosive collision with the jack knifed semi
kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the crash
thomas sees kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor
kimberly notices clear watching her and toughens up
she forces back the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away
i know i know
we need my eyes
clear sits beside kimberly
its all right
ill take watch
kimberly looks grateful and a moment passes between them but shes already buried the need to cry
just caught me by surprise
put it back on
clear does watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse
make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight
taken care of
back back back until the patrol car slowly creeps backwards down the onramp
there it is
thomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past the white van
a clean shot of the license plate
as thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate number the pause function dislodges slowly advancing the tape frame by frame
i dont get it
why is everything happening so fast
a month went by before anyone died
and now five people are dead in less than a day
thomas computer screen finally fills with information
here we go
the vehicles a delivery van registered to jorge and isabella cruz
and christ theres almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two
we need to hurry
they all get up and leave
ominously the monitor shows the next vehicle creeping behind noras pacer a white van
thomas pulls up to an upper middle class house
thomas kimberly and clear get out and start up the unlit path
its dark hard to see where theyre going so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning the walkway
lets lay this on her gently now
the stress alone could upset the pregnancy
kimberly nods ever creeping closer to the front door when automatic lights flash from over the garage
all three freeze for a moment during which we hear stomping emanate from within the house and the lights shut off
but nothing else happens
no one comes to a door
thomas sighs and as if suddenly remembering his status he walks fearlessly and purposefully to the front door
he makes a fist is about to knock when the door flings open and a rottweiler lunges for his throat only to have its collar snagged at the last second
by its owner jorge cruz late s handsome cocky
he speaks above rottys what
im officer burke
im looking for an isabella cruz
suddenly with an unexpected fury jorge screams at his dog
the rottweiler cowers and jorge shoves it to the floor where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away
jorges face is once again pleasant but its a thin veneer
jorge sees clear and kimberly behind thomas and frowns
are you jorge cruz
whats this about
may we come in
whats this about
angle on clear eyeing what appears to be drops of blood on the tile floor
she takes in what she can see of as if a tornado had hit it
wedding photos smashed and torn
furniture over turned
a little stern its about your wife isabella
now is she here
jorges eyes flicker ever so involuntarily behind him
but by now thomas has seen everything clear has and more
he stares through the house into a bedroom and sees a female foot lying half buried under the bedspr ead
look pal its probably nothing
but i need to see jorge is already closing the door
youll need a warrant
i know im a lawyer
clear rushes the door shoulders it and expertly wriggles past jorges grasp
you cant go in there
clear tears into the bedroom grabs the bedspread and throws it to the floor to reveal a young woman naked trembling with fear takes a closer look at clear
we never meant to hurt you isa
youre not isabella
meanwhile jorge yells at thomas
im going to sue your ass
whose blood is that on the floor
defensively jorge holds up his arm
mine you idiot
the dog went nuts this afternoon
now arrest her
did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater
its time to come clean
we had a fight
some things got broken the dog went crazy she left me
wouldnt say where she was going
what was the fight about
take a guess
does she have a cell phone
a way we can contact her
he eyes a shattered cell phone on the floor
were wasting time with this piece of shit
lets just get to the meeting
jorge turns to soothe the frightened young woman in the bed
hey when you find her tell her the kids half mine
clear mutters something as they exit the house
we can only pray it doesnt come out retarded
jorge hisses something at the rotty which charges them and springs
but thomas slams the door on the frothing dog just in time
rory sits in his chevette outside an apartment building staring up at the address
he quickly snorts some powder off his key and wipes his nostrils free of crystals
he takes a breath and exits the car
rory follows some people into the elevator
the elevator doors close on his shoe trapping rory in an awkward position
one man frantically pushes the doors open button to no avail
finally as the elevator rises rory yanks his foot free
i wrote to management two weeks ago about these friggin bumpers
rory bends down and inspects his shoe
damn is that dogshit
rory briefly holds the shoe too close to the mans face see
before disgustedly slipping it back on
the doors open
the man hurries out and the elevator doors close on rorys smirking face
reveal nora rory and kat mortified sit on a couch
its obvious the bombs been dropped reality has set in
clear and kimberly await their reactions
nora raises a trembling hand
does anybody have a valium
kat opens her purse and hands her a blue pill
youll want to take nora pops it in her mouth
half of that
nora chews her eyes half dead from bereavement
across the loft thomas paces phone in hand
quietly into phone any word yet on the dodge van
eugene alone seems unafraid
he uses a grabber a long pole with movable claw on the end to open the skylight
when done he balances the long pole precariously against the wall
an ominous breeze enters
clear notices magazine pages blowing over the desk by the couch
so that would mean
this is crazy
first deaths stalking us and now premonitions
this cant be happening
my careers at a peak i finally met a cute guy i just bought a new house
just shut the fuck up and maybe youll live
kats hands ball into fists
the hatred is mutual
clear reaches for a nearby cardboard box on the desk noticing magazine pages blowing over until their weight tips over a pencil holder which spills pens out
she takes the box to nora
youre not next nora
nobody has to be next
thats the point
last time we didnt plan
we werent organized
now we can help each other
she reaches into the box and passes out cell phones to nora and the others
think what would have happened if kimberly had been able to warn you with the word pigeons
noras head falls
kimberly senses her anguish and takes over
the point is as long as you know what to beware of you have a fighting chance
it can be beaten
if i call you and say subway get to a high rise fast
a place where no subway could possibly go get it
everyone nods in understanding
rory fidgets sniffling then pounds the table in frustration
why the hell did i ever get on route in the first place
thats me mr
dumb fucking luck
clear very alert looks at the tipped pencil holder
pens roll toward the end of the desk toward a large white pages directory which hangs precariously off the edge just so
anyone read todays paper
the article on evan shaeffer
no one says a word
the only reason he was on route was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings
that lucky bastard
what about the rest of you
kimberly you were driving to daytona
was route your first choice
the new freeway was faster but route was the way my mom used to take so
they take turns going around the room
route is drakes assignment but he called in sick so i got
blanches drakes never sick
i was my first day of jury duty
thats randomly selected by social security numbers
what you think death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago
rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet
last july i dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident
they asked me what number means good luck in jewish
and its hebrew
anyway i guessed it right and won these
rory holds up two yankee tickets
the best way to get to yankee stadium is route
i dont know whats weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance
realization whoa nine months
are you thinking what im thinking
reveal shes lying down binging on take out food while speaking on the motel phone
a disturbing metallic squeak scrape squeak can be heard nearly drowning out the screaming couple next door
yes id like to report a domestic squabble my name
isabella cruz why does it matter
im at the super motel
yes i own a white van
just get over here
isabella hangs up recoiling at violent thumps against her wall
pull back and up to reveal the source of the unsettling squeak is a rickety wobbling ceiling fan
kimberly whispers into the phone
im sorry dad were having a hard time with shainas eulogy
ill stay here at virginias tonight and see you tomorrow
i love you too
she hangs up looking guilty for having lied to her father
clear keeps her eyes on the pens that roll on the slightly canted table into the about to fall white pages directory
remember everyone just because kimberlys got the power doesnt mean were not all capable of seeing signs to some extent
the pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and plops heavily onto a goose down throw pillow
small feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze
everyone in the room watches them rise
its like forrest gump
they float across the room ultimately landing on a mousetrap
the trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable grabber which tips and slowly slides down the wall
clear in a chair looks directly above her head at a large swordfish mounted on the wall
the grabber picks up speed arcs downward and hits the mounted swordfish
the supporting brackets give causing the swordfish to tip and slide downward
clear lurches back in her chair just in time the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs
should have seen that coming
the institutions made me soft
clear gets up carefully easing herself around the swordfish
eugene isnt quite sure what to make of what hes just seen
if death has got such a hard on for you maybe you should get the hell away from us
we need her
shes the only one whos dealt with this before idiot
kimberly looks self conscious by her outburst
clear however looks grateful
were all going to have to open our eyes from now on
look out for each other
sleep in shifts
looks around apartment and weve got to safeproof this deathtrap
everyone but nora and eugene helps unplug appliances put out the fire take down hanging objects switch off the gas put sharp objects away affix padding to chart corners
kat placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box nervously pulls out a pack of smokes
thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall
im going outside for a smoke
you think you should
its not safe out there
noras gotta bite it before me anyway right
kat steps towards the front door then remembers the cell phone and grabs it just in case
thomas smiles good job at her
kimberly unscrewing the light bulb looks up when nora rises from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket
kimberly looks concerned
where are you going nora
nora fights the sleeve dazed and defeated
four years ago my husband died
theres nothing left for me
kimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain
dont say that
once you lose hope its already too late
nora looks up anger surfacing
if its my time to go to be in heaven with my family then i can accept that
you cant give up
dont accept deaths plan
trust me you can fight this
if we can just survive long enough until that baby is born we can nora looks more resolute than ever
if youll excuse me i have a funeral to prepare
everyone looks crushed when nora heads for the door
except eugene who stands up as well
yeah why am i listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house
as eugene heads out kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him
seeing you die once was enough for me
i control my life not fate
ill be sure to put that on your tombstone
rory presses a cell phone into eugenes hand on his way out
and even if you dont believe give this to nora
eugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times
nora nervously ties her long hair back in a single braid
the nervous group finishes safe proofing the apartment
rory standing on the couch pulls a police academy diploma off the wall and slips stumbling backwards into the closet
staggering he accidentally knocks some coat hangars and a volleyball trophy from the high shelf to the floor
thomas whips around and sees that rorys not hurt
he then lowers his gaze and sees the figurine of a volleyball trophy is framed by a tangled jumble of wire coat hangars
suddenly streetlight flickers on for the evening
oddly it only illuminates the trophy hangar array
from rorys vantage point it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man with hooks emanating from his body
the sodium vapor lamp casts an ominous glow around the image
man with hooks
i see a man with hooks
the others look over trying to see what he does
unsure i kinda see it yeah
noras going to be killed by a man with hooks
kimberly and clear stare at the volleyball trophy the street lamp ominously flickers out and dies
everyone looks around for a hesitant beat then thomas picks up his cell phone
clear first walks then runs out the door
the elevator finally comes
eugene and nora get inside standing in front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of muzak plays ac dcs highway to hell
going down right
the gaunt man says nothing
the doors close
eugene stares blankly at the concave mirror in the upper corner
hes disturbed by the warped reflection of the gaunt man leans closer to noras hair and as the doors finally close he leans over and smells it
um by the way your shoes untied
nora bends down to tie her shoelace the one that snapped
she tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as eugenes cell phone vibrates in his hand
startled he drops it to the floor
then looks embarrassed
probably for you anyway
nora picks it up
its hard to make out thomas yelling
i cant hear
a beat of confusion then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks and hands of the prosthetic limbs
what is it
but noras too frightened to speak
eugene grabs the phone hearing unintelligible static
as she frantically hits the elevator button
when it fails to come she runs downstairs
nora slowly rises to her feet feverishly mouthing a prayer
as the door opens nora rushes out unseen to her her long braid gets snagged on one of the prosthetic hooks yanking her backwards
let me go let me go
oh watch it youve caught your uh
the guant mans sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his outward appearance
goodness gracious darling let me help you with
nora panic s as eugene and the man try to untangle her braid
nora desperately spins her body around sticking her head back inside the elevator
kat appears in the lobby smoking a cigarette
you alright nora
the elevator doors begin to close and clamp around noras neck her head inside body outside the elevator
eugene pounds on the bumpers but they dont seem to work
my god someone please let me out of this the up button is lit
clear rushes to the lobby
the elevator rises
inside the elevator eugene watches noras head drop to floor level then he pounds the emergency button which shorts out
noras body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor
noras screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly lurches upwards
kat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor
the horror never ends
clear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight
she runs to the elevator doors trying to pry them apart to no avail
all kat can do crying is grab hold of noras flailing legs and try to pull her back down
the elevator lurches a final time
noras headless body fall down into kats arms knocking her to the floor
kat freaks skittering away as the body convulses
eugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear
a bloodcurdling moan escapes him
he stares transfixed as noras head still aghast in terror rolls around the floor
the sight clearly sends eugene over the edge
he screams claws and pounds desperate to escape the elevator
eugene suddenly bursts through the door babbling incoherently
kimberly thomas and rory look on bewildered
no escapes my ass
i control my fate
i die on my terms hear me reaper cockscuker
eugenes in another world
he approaches thomas and lunges for his gun yanking it from the holster
what the hell are you
aint going out like that
on my terms
just take it easy
a twisted insane smile comes to eugenes face as he jams the gunbarrel to his temple
the others shrink back in terror
he pulls the trigger
eugene tries again
thomas looks stunned as eugene goes through every round click click kimberly breaths a sigh of relief
you dont keep it loaded
thomas eyes disagree
he reaches in and grabs the gun away from eugene who stands there trembling
thomas cracks open the cylinder
maybe they were all duds
six in a row
thats like sinking realization winning the lottery
it wasnt his turn to die
everyone turns to see clear and kat standing in the doorway drenched in blood
kat trembles uncontrollably
can we find the pregnant woman please
flashing lights from rescue vehicles illuminate the living room
in the newly conformed safe house kat and clear relax as best they can in thomas dry clothes
thomas makes another phone call
in the corner eugene shivers to himself
desperately looking for signs of danger
he looks over to clear
your entire world view just went out the window
i couldnt expect a religious conversation overnight
well get through this
beat i promise
eugene looks immensely relieved
rory ambles over to kimberly his typical callousness gone
can i ask you a question
when i die
is it gonna hurt
i dont know
he expected as much
he fishes his license and keys out of his pocket
and youre gonna die after me right
i guess so
re keys and license would you take these
and if i die
tears well up could you throw all my drugs out
paraphernalia porno you know
anything that would break my moms heart
kimberly looks deeply into his eyes looking for the punchline
when she doesnt see one she nods tenderly and takes the keys
the phone rings
rory jumps at the sound paranoid eyes in scan mode
thomas answers speaks softly hangs up
a one very pissed off ms
isabella cruz is being detained up in greenwood
lets finish this thing
kats ford expedition winds its way through rural new york
a sports car speeds past on the left then as it pulls in front of the exped ition its slipstream sucks over some debris from the shoulder a thin metal
piece of trim which bounces in front of kats expeditions left front tire
cu kats wheel well the metal trim is shot upward into the wheel well where it lodges firmly its sharp metal edge grinding against kat drives thomas reading directions in
the shotgun seat
kimberly eugene and rory ride in back
in the cargo area clear scans out the rear window for danger
is this safe guys
i mean someone in this car is about to get whacked
do the rest of us really feel like sitting next to him
off kats glare or her
an uncomfortable beat
guys lets not panic
how do you know
you said she was going to drive into a lake
how can she when shes in protective custody
isabella pissed is in a holding tank
small town deputy steve adams s cleans his gun in her direction
what do you mean grand theft auto
this is insane
hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by monday mor ning
figures it out jorge
when i get out of here im going to sue his cheating ass off
as she fumes a rivulet of water streaks down her leg
oh my god
steve at first confused sees the water and gasps
are you kidding me
he rushes across the room pulls a lever unlocking the cell
as steve throws on his jacket we reveal its prominent emblem small town station
only one patrol car
in the patrol car isabella buckles up in the sho tgun seat the belt stretched tightly across her belly
deputy steve tries the ignition but the car wont start
damn they always stick me with the clunker
take my van
kats expedition speeds through a yellow light and continues on
metal sheers away more rubber
rory antsy rubbing his nostrils stares at two yankee tickets
heres what i dont get
for nine months death does all this shit to make sure i win these tickets and end up on route at exactly the right time for the pile up
but why single me out
what am i in the great scheme of things
youd think i stepped off flight or something
fucking weird man
you want weird
last year my partner and i were heading out for the graveyard shift
a call comes in about a train wreck and frank decides to let me handle it alone
beat frank died that night in a shootout
id be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later
everyone nods in that lifes weird reverence kind of way
i got that beat
so like last may i was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in pennsylvania
there was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night
yeah so what happened
i never mad it
the greyhound bus i was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop
was that in mt
how did you know
sinking realization that bus you were on
it killed terry mathers
she was supposed to die on flight
im not sure i shit
the call about the train wreck that saved my life
that was the night i scraped up billy hitchcock
another kid from flight
a chill passes over the group
deputy steve speeds the white van up the narrow winding road
isabella breathes lamaze style through intense pain
i wont have the baby
in this van
speeding up the incline steve tries to speed around a volkswagon beetle but cars scream by in the opposite direction
get around it
steve leans on the horn and stomps the gas dangerously riding the shoulder around the beetle
way ahead of the beetle on the left side is a lake
brian gibbons cheerfully drives a tractor hauling a whoodchipper across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick branches
the tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road
he tries the ignition pumps the gas
only by standing on the tractor can brian see the white van speeding up the hill toward him
he jumps down and frantically tires starting the tractor
once twice nothing
cu front tire metal shreds away more rubber
rory excitedly makes a connection
remember the theater in paris that collapsed last year killed everyone inside
everyone nods anticipating
i had tickets to go but one day im in paris trippin on acid sippin lattes an such and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign
freaked me out so bad i hid in a shopping cart for four hours
course missed the show
what about you kimberly
did you anyone from flight
clear stops when she sees all the color has drained from kimberlys face
even eugene looks concerned
are you okay
the car becomes completely silent except for the slight scraping as kimberly prepares to tell her story
a little over a year ago my mother and i went to the mall
i was supposed to meet her outside but i got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide
i kept thinking how can you strangle yourself in a bathtub
thomas mouths tod
it felt wrong
continuing there were gunshots outside and i ran
chokes up some kids tried to jack her car
she fought them off she was a fighter and they killed her
kimberly looks to clear
after the funeral i had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me
i figured thats how everyone must feel
but i guess i was right
thomas reaches between the seats and takes kimberlys hand
as he looks into her eyes kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a cigarette
the tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile
brian grabs a cord and starts up the whoodchipper
its all starting to come together
when alex got us off flight it didnt just change our lives
it affected everyone and everything weve come into contact with ever since
im not sure i understand
being alive after our time caused an outward ripple a rift in deaths design
eugene nods slowly getting it
so if you never got off the plane none of us would be ali ve in the first place
thats why death is working backwards
its tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene s that do not appear or occur elsewhere in
the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
a thick retread sheers itself onto the pavement
the wood chipper roar s loudly
suddenly some forgotten stray chunk shoots from the spout the airborne chunk of wood cracks the white vans windshield
steve veers out of control
kat sees the white van ahead swerving into her lane
she quickly jerks the wheel to the right
kats left front tire blows
it sends rubber flying and the entire suv pulls hard to the left spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic toward the white van
steve jerks the wheel to the left
the white van has a close near miss with the expedition and goes off the road toward a lake
the suv misses the tractor but sails off the other side of the embankment spinning and rolling towards at the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm a
propane tank sits at the edge of the property
the suv barrels down the hill coming right for it
all kat can do is cover her head with her arms
speeding toward the lake
isabella screams in pain not fear
the white van is ready for splashdown
steve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator
hes able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard jerk
were okay were okay
its about to get creamed but the bouncing expedition just barely misses it
it continues backwards crashing through a temporary fence and right into the expedition plows past earth movers crashing through irrigation ditches and pipes shrapnel flying everywhere
just as the expedition comes to a stop an irrigation pipe rockets through the rear window miraculously missing clear and rory coming to a rest just behind kats head
steve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows down
isabella squeezes his hand white
its not going to wait
ive got to stop and help those people
do you want to deliver this baby
steve looks ill then sees another car stopping by the crash
he floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio
the dust settles in the silent car
the only sound is a quiet wet wheeze
clear dazed looks around carefully avoiding the metal spike that skewers the vehicle
rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it
kimberly shakes her hair spilling glass onto the floor
kat tries to open the door but it wont budge
not my time
is everybody alright
thomas turns to see eugene spasming in the back seat
he clutches his ribcage in agony and wheezes
blood trickles from his mouth
he cant breathe
he cant breathe
oh my god eugene
eugenes head tilts forward unconscious
brian gibbons jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident
at the edge of the property is a common farm fence made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires
brian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a dead oak tree ten feet inside the fence
in the bg mr
gibbons darts inside a double wide construction trailer
to the crash site
brians jaw drops as he absorbs the chilling sight of a guy and a girl dragging a blood soaked man from the back seat to perform cpr on him
around brian voices mesh in a surreal haze
stop it dont move him
he cant breathe damn it
i think his lungs collapsed
someone call for help
we steadicam around brian to reveal a woman screaming from the drivers seat
the sound is surreal
i cant move my fucking leg
please get me out of here before it explodes
the color drains from brians face as the dying man on the ground coughs blood and the girl performing cpr recoils
the moment is still surreal as brian steps back further away from the horrors he cant face
into the street and rory yanks him back from imminent death as an ambulance speeds onto the property
watch it dude
that snaps brian back to reality
sounds become normal again
brian collects himself and sniffs the air
he then drops to ground level looking under the expedition for something
help us we need help over here
to kat reassuringly i dont smell any gas
and nones dripping either
brian sticks his head in kats window and peers down at her trapped leg
he swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick flannel sleeve reaches in and tries to yank the door open with all his might
no good kat screams in pain
i still need this foot thank you
brian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over
clear watches two emts lo ad eugene into the back of an ambulance
an oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth
be careful with that check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses
oh watch for potholes and puddles
as clear continues the exasperated paramedics do their best to ignore her
when she tries to climb inside she is pushed away
look i made him a promise sorry
theres no room
again shes shoved away and steps back helpless
thomas and kimberly stand by kat still trapped in the suv
get that over here
move move move
a rescue worker carries the jaws of life past clear towards the expedition
excuse me hot soup coming through
the hydraulic hose that leads back to the power unite wraps around as the hose tightens clear realizes shes surrounded by shards of glass and metal
she quickly wrestles herself free of the hose and watches the paramedics lock eugenes gurney into place
one more thing
watch out for power lines
the doors slam revealing the phelps memorial hospital logo
the ambulance speeds off spraying gravel at her
she reaches into her pocket and withdraws a crushed cell phone
she runs back over to thomas
we have to contact isabella now
a news van tries to weave through the emergency vehicles to get closer to teh accident
it sinks into the loose dirt scraping a large rock
the gas tank emts angrily wave the news van back to the road where it parks near the twin wire fence opposite the dead oak tree
immediately a camera crew exits the van to catch the action
rory steps behind the news van making sure he cant be seen and digs into his sock coming up with a bindle
rory cringes at his name pockets his stash then exits frame
we push in the news van gas tank is leaking
a small drip
thomas kimberly clear and rory watch the jaws of life being clamped onto kats door
wheres the cell phone clear gave you
i think i gave it to eugene back at your place
we have to call the greenwood police station and warn isabella
thomas runs in the direction of some local police
after he leaves rory drifts away from the pack hand in pocket
kimberly moves back to kat who chain smokes in the front seat of the expedition
you doing alright in there
my legs are starting to cramp up
and god why am i so thirsty
does anyone have any fiji
the ka chunk of the jaws of life next to kat startles her half to death
christ you wanna give me a heads up next time pal
brian and mr
gibbons approach with a cup of tap water
they hand it to kat who frowns but drinks anyway
of the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle
gas slithers over packed dirt around debris toward the crash site
speaks to another cop who clicks off his radio
shes at phelps memorial
theyre prepping her to give birth right now
a few miles up the road
near the docks
lights one cigarette off the other ka chucnk
the sound makes her flinch dropping the cigarette on the floor
damn cant you be quieter with that thing
dripping scorn sure ill just set it to the quiet mode
kat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales
she jumps again but maintains her composure
the gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel through pipes closer and closer to the expedition
at one point the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site
looks confused to watch rory climb between the fence wires and drift the dead oak tree into the field
thomas runs down the hill toward kimberly
we gotta go now
isabellas in labor
rescue workers pull off a large chunk of door
what about that
calls over to kat how you doing in there hero
re spike behind head i guess it could be worse
brian hands out drinks to rescue workers
so lets go
where the hell is rory
thomas sees rory in the field and angrily hops the fence heading directly under the dead oak tree
rory his back to everyone finally opens the bindle
enraptured he delicately unfolds it
is put on alert by a fresh breeze
her attention is caught by the window of an emergency vehicle
in the reflection kimberly sees a man sitting on the expedition but when she spins ar ound theres no one there
the door comes off the expedition finally freeing kat
gibbons applauding with everyone else chooses that very moment to sit on the bumper
slamming kats head backwards through the spike head kabob
kats dead limp hand drops her last cigarette which bounces along the hard dirt toward the oncoming gas
the breeze kicks up aiding the cigarette
whoosh the gas fuse catches
the blusih flame travels through pipes over rocks racing toward the news van
kimberly half traumatized watches an ominous breeze rustle through the field up to the trees toward thomas
the gas burns up an incline and disappears into the ground
and pops up twenty feet closer to the news van
kimberly follows the breeze to the dead oak tree under which thomas stands
and blows a large branch until it snaps
a startled thomas sees it fall just in time to dive to safety
clear seeing the flame instinctively runs from the van
the news vans explosion hurls two fence posts just over thomas head end over end the two lengths of wire stretched between them
the flying garrote heads directly for rory who sorts hard stands up with a satisfied smile and is sliced into three sharp cuts of beef
the silence from the emergency crew is deafening
gibbons starts crying hysterically
i didnt mean to do it i didnt know
kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch the one that caused thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence
to herself it wasnt his turn
and its not my turn
kimberly sees the corpses of kat and rory buries the pain and approaches mr
give me the keys to your truck
hysterical anything you want
i wish i knew
gibbons hands kimberly the keys
kimberly drives thomas and clear in the gibbons truck
all are numb
buckling up hurry up
theres no time
shes about to give birth
kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it
what are you doing
youre going to kill us
if anyone dies from a crash now itll be me
but i cant die if eugene and isabella are still alive
im last on deaths list
are you crazy
what makes you think youd survive
what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn
considering six duds in a row
and when it was rorys turn to die and thomas was in the way
that branch fell and saved my life
youre right deaths maintaining the order
lets pray that isabellas still alive
the truck speeds into the horizon
typical chatter as the staff preps isabella
steve paces nervously in the background
contractions coming quicker now
take her pressure and ctg
one centimeter dilation
prep the epidural stat
isabella breathes lamaze style in the hospital bed her feet in stirrups
a nurse rocks isabellas body back and forth until her back arches almost unnaturally forward
in the bg an obstetrician s sterilizes his hands in a scrub sink
a female anesthesiologist hustles over swabbing a long epidural needle
the nurse places a mask over isabellas face
the anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of isabellas spine
shes going to have to stop moving if im going to the nurse sneezes
goddamn it keep her still
tracing skin between isabellas constantly moving vertebra
it buzzes about the room darting between the he ads of the doctors and nurses hovering above the anesthesiologist who traces the long needle down isabellas spine finding the proper
perfectly still now
as the tip of the needle presses the skin down the bee lands on the anesthesiologists ear
the needle sinks in a nurse gasps
did something go wrong
tears welling now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it
kimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick from wet leaves
this makes no sense
isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake
could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested
i dont think so
alexs premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it
then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect eugene and isabella for as long as we can
if only alex and i had done that with the others alex might still be
a somber beat
then thomas looks over at the speedometer
this is a neighborhood
you may wanna slow it down
nothing can happen to us
i wasnt worried about us
suddenly kimberly clutches her throat
a nurse hovers over us in a hospital wrestling us down by the look of things
there is screaming all around
the image comes at us so fast we see only the briefest glimpse of the nametag on her uniform kimberly
kimberly comes to at the wheel flailing desperately at the steering wheel
she even claws at thomas who tries to control the neglected steering wheel
kimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve where cars are backed up at a stop sign
kimberly screams and slams on the brakes
the truck skids on wet leaves completely out of control towards a landscaping truck parked on the shoulder
kimberlys truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty feet into the air dukes of hazzard style
and lands miraculously without a scratch
on a parallel road
and keeps going
dumb insane fucking luck
kimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window
she turns around with a cocky smile
she rubs her throat and floors it again to thomas horror more determined
eyes darting what did you see
what am i looking for
no its not here
this one was different
more like the pile up and the van going into the lake
it wasnt just a sign i was there
confused another premonition
i was in a hospital
there was screaming
a nurse was choking me
i couldnt tell wh at she looked like but the name tag was right in my face
i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death
wiping frame a nurse enters a room and reads a clipboard on an unseen patients bed
reveal eugene lying in a hospital bed wired to the latest medical hardware
nearby a respirator plunges up and do wn the respirator tube snaking down eugenes throat
the nurses hand reaches down to eugenes neck
eugene winces when the nurse gives the tube a friendly little shake to check if its stable
can you feel that in your trachea
eugene rolls his eyes
i got burnt babies in the childrens ward braver than you
she sticks an electri c thermometer in his ear
eugene opens his mouth as if to speak
you wont be talking for at least a month
think you can handle that jabberjaw
eugene looks ready to cry
the nurse sits on the bed jarring eugene enough to make him wince again
everyone learns to love me once they get used to my sense of humor okay
eugene looks grat eful to see a humane side to this creature
the pick up truck races to the hospital
as kimberly speeds past a billboard a police car pulls in hot pursuit
shouldnt we pull over
i wouldnt know how to explain any of this anyway
at the next intersection two more cop cars appear
oh come on
the pick up truck blows by the second pair of cop cars which instantly join the high speed chase
kimberly takes a long look in the rearview mirror at the tailgating cops
she then inspects the road ahead
a busy six lane intersection
what do you want me to do
hesitated beat speed up
yeah fuck em
to thomas no offense
kimberly speeds toward the intersection
she pulls her seatbelt aside making sure it offers zero protection
thomas jumps in the backseat buckles up
be alive isabella please be alive
kimberlys eyes widen in fear
her foot hesitates over the brake pedal as the truck blindly blazes through the busy intersection miraculously missing every car
the police are just barely able to fishtail into degree turns avoiding the intersection completely
kimberlys eyes open and she lets out a victory cry
pan over and down to eugene tries to watch a news flash of his accident on the tv across the room but a bulky orderly blocks his view
ironically impaled through the head as a result of an emergency airbag deploying
as eugene shudders with dread the orderly pushes a huge cart in front of him again obscuring his view
eugene frantically pantomimes writing
need a pen
if you like ill bring crosswords for you too
eugene tries nodding his thanks but the tube in his throat hampers his movement
police have speculated that one of the deaths may have been narcotics related and urge children to stay away from d rugs
finally the orderly pushes the cart away revealing the tv
an anchor man taps his pages on the desktop
good advice sue
and stay in school
up next johnny showers has the weather
a weatherman dressed as a frog points out cloud formations
eugene tormented stares at the screen as the orderly begins pushing the huge cart out of the room
the sound of a skidding car fills the room
it comes from the tv which shows a psa featuring crash test dummies
jeez its freezing in here
the orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one vents close just below the ceiling
eugenes eyes fill with terror he knows somethings wrong
it hisses softly
we follow the oblivious orderly out of the room
a hospital administrator briskly strides up to the orderly
what are you doing
the henzels are still waiting for you in the childrens ward the orderly smacks his forehead shit
right right right
gregorys big day
dempsey in hydrotherapy cant feel her legs
the orderly nodding rapidly is halfway down the hall by now
the administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past
the huge cart
which now blocks the door on eugenes room
kimberly seems to have ditched the cops
she speeds the pick up through the medical facility
the pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital
kimberly thomas and clear run outside and into the building
the oxygen hose hisses but is drowned out by the volume of the tv
eugenes eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial ends
the n a news report comes on
the banner footage showing grieving families wreaths on doors yellow ribbons and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart dissolve together over mor e tears were shed this morning in the wake
of yesterdays tragedy that rocked the tri state area
suddenly the frayed electric cord of eugenes tv begins sparking
the sound drops out the picture sputters
eugene goes white with terror
he looks back to the broken oxygen tube
the beeps of the eeg machine frantically increase
eugene reaches for the nurse call switch
mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters
clear kimberly and thomas dash toward the main desk
what rooms she in
im sorry i cant give out that info unless youre a relative
im her sister
the receptionist eyes her dubiously
ill have to see your id ms
clear vaults over the counter straight arms the receptionist and seizes the computer
thomas and kimberly look on stunned
delivery rooms are downstairs
ill find eugene and catch up with you
kimberly and thomas hurry to the elevator banks
then reconsider and enter the stairwell
eugene scratches the top sheet of the bed trying to inch the call switch closer and closer to him
but it wont budge
a rat appears behind eugenes pillow crawls over his chest and disappears by his stomach
he pounds desperately on the empty food tray his side rails looks toward the door outside the door you cant hear a thing in the bustling hallway as people rush
kimberly and thomas rush past his door lost
hurry i think shes this way
his eyes scream insanely but he respirator tube prevents any sound from escaping him
and thats when the rat appears on the floor and begins gnawing on the respirators power cord
when eugene sees this the eeg machine climbs off the charts
clear takes off down the hallway
the receptionist shaken dials her phone
the obstetrician voices concern
listen to me isabella i need you to stop pushing
is the baby all right
its a breach
if i cant reverse it we may need to do a caesarian
the obstetricians hands go to work
steve looks ill
maybe i should step outside
running down the corridor
code blue in delivery room
the rat gnaws away at eugenes power cord eugene looks trapped helpless tortured
his eyes dart from the sparking tv to the gnawed power cord to the useless call switch
clear walks up and down the corridor scanning room numbers as she passes
a a a
a hand suddenly grabs clear and shoves her against the wall
reveal a security guard leering at her
just where do you think youre going
clear struggles to get away getting sympathetic looks from an old man walking a rolling iv stand down the corridor
isabella is pushing again
i see the head
the nurse takes a pair of scissors off a tray
clear plays possum offering no resistance to the security guard as the old man wheels his iv stand along
suddenly clear grabs the stand and whams the heavy wheeled base into the guards balls
as the guard recoils she thoughtfully hands the iv back to the old man and runs
the nurse is startled when kimberly and thomas burst through the door
in the bg a puzzled steve peeks inside until kimberly pulls the door closed
what are you doing in here
get the hell out
finally we hear the baby cry
the nurse immediately moves in to swaddle the newborn
kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking isabella
isabella look down and see your son
to the confusion of everyone around them kimberly and thomas burst into cheers
they jump dance and hug each other
its a magical moment the rat stops gnawing
the tv stops sparking
a wave of intense relief washes over eugene
he pantomimes reaching into his shirt pocket and lighting a victory cigar
relaxed and invigorated kimberly and thomas giddily exit the delivery room as clear runs up to them
a guard grabbed me before i could find eugene
dont sweat it
she had the baby
new life defeats death
weve done it
death has to rewrite the list
steve watches confused as clear whoops with delight and hugs the others
clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her
kimberly laughs with her then is suddenly rocked by a vision looking up a the eeg machine
are you okay
kimberly on the ground looks frazzled as she snaps out of her trance
thomas helps her to her feet
are you okay
you just face planted
i know how it feels to be dead
her lips blue kimberly shivers uncontrollably
clear sees two security guards round a distant corner and quickly walks the others toward an emergency loading zone
what did you see
i was dead
and came back to life
an eeg machine
but its over
isabellas baby was the key
you saw her die and everything right
what if i made a mistake
she was on the onramp
kimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers
moment of the pile up premonition
a white van in fr ont of kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder
kimberly screams swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident
kimberly overcome with self doubt
im not sure
i dont think isabella was ever destined to die in the pile up
then whats the premonition of the lake supposed to mean
can you remember anything about it
kimberly shuts her eyes remembering grease covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control toward a lake
the van crashes through a railing and plunges into the water
in moments the van fills with water the driver inside trapped
and on the rearview mirror six floral scented air freshners
kimberly looks down at her grease covered hands and looks ill
the same hands from the van
finally everything makes sense to clear
its you kimberly
the premonitions are about you
kimberly trembles refusing to accept what shes hearing
it cant be
suddenly remembering i have to save eugene
clear leaves kimberly and thomas together
kimberly verges on tears and thomas consoles her with a hug
clear looks at passing room numbers while hurrying down the corridor
she comes to a room with a huge cart parked outside blocking the door
she looks up to see b
clear leans into it pushing it out of the way of the door
are you in there
eugene strains to hear through the thick door
can you hear me
im coming in
an intense wave of relief washes over eugene
as kimberly hugs thomas she watches clear push the cart past the door
make way make way lovebirds
kimberly spins as eugenes orderly passes her a paper pen and a crossword book in one hand a birthday cake in the other
the cake reads happy birthday gregory
the thirteen sparkling candles on top oddly frame clears head
the orderly speeds down the corridor toward clear whose hand reaches for eugenes door handle
she leans into it to clear thanks hon the henzels are going crazy for this thing
watch as clear opens the door briefly revealing eugene a whoosh of oxygen clears body is obscenely hurled end over end towards the camera heading straight for kimberly and thomas
thomas throws himself and kimberly around the corner to prevent being crushed by clears lifeless body
the hospital erupts in total chaos
just as kimberly is about to break down completely she sees a woman hurrying down the hallway in their direction pushing a crash cart
kimberly sees the nametag kalarjian
excuse me please
defribulator paddles rest on top
and then dr
kalarjian passes them toward the area of the explosion
kimberly ominously turns the camera following her view until she sees a small lake across the street from the hospital
oh my god
the eeg machine
just then an ambulance skids up to the nearest entrance
paramedics jump out and run towards the blast site
you cant cheat destiny
i know what i have to do to save us
i have to die
you cant give up now
we can still fight this thing
but kimberly isnt listening
she stares through the glass doors at the a red stripe down the side but the hood is completely white
six floral scented air fresheners hang from the rearview
the van from her vision
and its running
i have to do this
kimberly wipes tears from her eyes kisses thomas cheek then turns and runs before he can speak
kimberly heads right for the open ambulance
the drivers door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in
thomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors which spark and short out
he struggles to pry them apart
kimberly shifts into gear and speeds off
thomas squeezes through the doors and runs after her
an emt the driver of the stolen ambulance rushes outside
what the fuck
thomas chases the ambulance watching helplessly as it barrels over curbs pylons and a fence ultimately plunging straight into the lake
thomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can the emt trailing far behind
kimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air thomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below
the surface and he dives in
thomas swims into the dark murky water
deeper and deeper he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door
he withdraws his baton and bangs on the glass nothing
he tries coming up for air but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper
he squirms frantically
and as his exhausted body loses consciousness everything ready and
the shock of defribulator paddles brings kimberly back to life
looking up at dr
kalarjian all she can see is part of a womans face and a partial nametage reading kalarjian
it would appear as if shes choking kimberly but an eeg monitor turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat the same pov as the premonition
five ccs of narcodon
i want her stabilized and prepped for icu
kimberly turns her head to see unconscious cpr being performed on him by the emt whos now soaking wet
thomas doesnt respond
an intern opens an eyelid points a flashlight at his eyes
shakes his head nothing
the sopping wet emt goes back to performing cpr
finally thomas coughs up water chokes gasps for air then bolts kimberly
he turns to see kimberly reaching out for him
immeasurably relieved he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform
kimberlys eyes fill with tears
whispering welcome back
we did it
i can feel it too
outside a parting of dark clouds causes a shaft of sunlight to flood into the hospital
its light covers kimberly and thomas with an ethereal glow
there are no more doubts theyve won
they exchange meek yet triumphant smiles in the smoky chaotic hospital
we are at a summer barbecue
frisbee lawn darts croquet et
shish kabob entering a mouth
kimberly taking a bite relishing the taste and calmly pulling the metal skewer from her mouth
my god this is delicious
i cant believe i used to be a vegan
thomas out of uniform takes a bite of his own
as the metal skewer is deep in his mouth a running frisbee player accidentally bumps into thomas
but no harm
thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his mouth around the shish kabob
so whats the deal thomas
three months and you still havent asked my daughter out on a date
kimberly turns red as mr
burroughs appears and takes a seat
whats wrong with a platonic relationship
platonic my ass
thats for ugly women
for gods sake leave him alone dad
smiling yeah dont make me cite you for harassment
im not hurting anyone
looking around lowering voice besides if you can beat death whats he got to worry about me for
gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food
his wife mrs
you know you still never explained to us how you did it
it seems by now everyones familiar with the concept
well technically when we died we gave death what it wanted
and by the time we were revived it had already moved on to graver pastures
gibbons makes a face finding the discourse distasteful
she changes the conversation
you know im having the greatest day
foods great too mrs
big props to you and brian
so ready for the back to school season
three short glorious weeks away
i wish i were going myself
burroughs you may want to think twice about letting her live in the village bob
our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face
looks grave among other places
a chorus of friendly laughter
dad used to call her the pincushion
brian enters frame soaking up fresh laughter
he holds a plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long wooden matches
dad you had the spatula last right
gibbons hands it over and brian saunters away from camera slightly out of focus toward the barbecue his body framed between kimberly and thomas heads
brian looks like hes having fun
owes it to that friend of yours in a way
gibbons immediately regrets having said that
well brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day
but your friend rory pulled him back at the last second
kimberly and thomas ominously turn their heads around
in the bg brian fidgets in front of the barbecue
you never told me that peter
boy that was lucky
the propane tank blows brian to smithereens
a deafening silence follows punctuated when brians arm lands on mrs
