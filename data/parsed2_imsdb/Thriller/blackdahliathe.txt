the black dahlia written by josh friedman based on the novel by james ellroy black and white newsreel footage from the s
clips from prize fights featuring two different boxers against various opponents
one a light heavyweight pure finesse a counterpunches the other stouter and stronger a headhunting puncher
the intercutting of the two fighters suggests a possible showdown at the end of the newsreel
no such luck
a triple carbon lapd incident report form trapped in an old corona typewriter
the keys pound letters into the blank spaces
a world war ii era personnel carrier transports twenty silent lapd officers into the heart of downtown los angeles
the sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop for their arrival
we focus in on bucky bleichert the counterpuncher from the newsreels as he jumps from the carrier
buckys minus his gun but plus a wwi tin helmet and a three pound truncheon
hundreds of in uniform gis use baseball bats and two by fours to beat the shit out of zoot suit wearing mexicans
most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and hobnob with the pockets of mps and shore patrol whove chosen to restore order by cheering on
their countrymen against the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters
sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows
darkness falls quickly on what bucky rightly realizes is chaos
suddenly buckys running away from the action
down a side street and onto a he slows to a jog trying to gather his thoughts
and then a voice bleichert
a police officer has three marines in dress blues and one zoot suiter cornered in a center walkway
the marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two by fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet dodging the blows like the ex
fighter he is
i already knew him by reputation had our respective records down pat lee blanchard as a heavyweight formerly a regular attraction at the hollywood legion stadium
the terrified mexican stands frozen on one side of blanchard trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the marines blows with his own truncheon
code three bleichert
bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in fending off the marines blows to jab at them with his stick
and he knew me bucky bleichert light heavy ranked tenth by ring magazine in fighting no name opponents in no mans land division
on instinct bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the marines with his fists connecting hard punches with soft midsections
voice over contd in our first year at central wed never spoke but people spoke of us
opinions about a fantasy bleichert blanchard fight and who would win
and now blanchard moves in lashing vicious truncheon blows to the shoulders of the marines sending them one by one into a heap
voice over contd id heard almost all of em blanchard by early ko bleichert by decision blanchard stopped on cuts everything but bleichert by knockout
the marines reduced to rubble lee blanchard turns his attention to the zooter he slaps handcuffs on him and leads him away
he motions for bucky to follow
lee turns back to the marines to the halls of tripoli shitbirds
one of them flips lee off
the zooter kicks him in the chest as lee pulls him away from them laughing
the three men start back toward the riots
gunshots can be heard
palm trees blaze up into the night
lee contd re the zooter bucky bleichert meet senor tomas dos santos subject of an all points fugitive warrant for manslaughter committed during the commission of a class b felony
snatched a purse off a hairbag and she keeled of a heart attack
you come all the way down here to roust smiling i came all the way down here same as you did
jerks a finger to the riots keep from gettin killed
happened to see those jarheads beatin on a good collar nudging dos santos habla ingles tomas
the man shakes his head no
lee contd hes dead meat
manslaughter twos a gas chamber jolt for spics
hepcat heres about six weeks away from the big adios
been better off getting a couple cracked ribs from our privates first class back there
blanchard spies a home with newspapers stacked on the front porch
lee contd well never get him booked tonight
tomas dos santos cuffed by his ankles to a radiator
the three men are on their second fifth of cutty sark swiped from the kitchen cupboard
dos santos sings a drunken spanish version of the chattanooga choo choo before slumping to his side and passing out
bucky covers him with a blanket
tom heres my ninth hard felon of the month
six weeks hell be sucking gas
in three years ill be working central warrants
jewboy deputy d
over there wets his pants for fighters
promised me the next spot he can wangle
not impressed impressive
not impressed either wanna hear something more impressive
my first twenty fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager
my girlfriend saw you fight a couple times over at the olympic
says maybe you could take me
lee gets up and wanders into the living room
from the kitchen bucky watches lee stare out at the flames
whatta we do about the mex
well take em in the morning
youll take him
hes half yours partner
hes all yours
and im not your partner
without turning someday
screaming in silence
tomas dos santos dying in a large plexiglas gas chamber
bucky stands in the back of the room forcing himself to watch
he cant stand it and leaves
lee also watches elbows on knees and chin in hands
he cant stand it either
bucky watches from afar as men in suits shake lees hand and brush imaginary lint off of his brand new sergeants stripes
their eyes meet briefly as bucky retreats to daylight
another triple carbon form filled out on the corona
transfer and promotion
sergeant lee blanchard
highland park vice to central warrants
effective an extremely bored bucky bleichert gives a man a speeding ticket and sends him on his way
bucky drives as a rookie cop chatters in the seat next to him
yep three years in the canal zone
nothin but skeeter bites and drunk fights over three dollar skank tail
bucky sits at his desk filling out a form as the rookie cop prattles on in the background
fights over three dollar skank tail
walks by the rookie and rolls his eyes
catching buckys look the cop throws him a shadow punching one two
bucky smiles thinly
returns to his paperwork
then another cop passes by and breaks into a bob and weave
bucky looks puzzled and annoyed
he grabs a third cop walking by tom joslin
somethin up tommy

off buckys look you know lee blanchard over at central warrants
his partners toppin his twenty and goin for early retirement
word is the felony d
s lookin for a bright boy to fill the spot
christ knows why but its down to you and johnny vogel for the spot
bucky takes a surreptitious peek across the room at johnny vogel fat slick hair and bad skin
his old man fritzies a central dick
chucking bucky on the chin but whod look better when they bring back the boxing team eh buckaroo
bucky shakes his head dismissing the whole thing
bucky drives on as the rookie talks and talks
warrants was local celebrity as a cop
warrants was plainclothes without a coat and tie romance and a mileage per diem on your civilian car
warrants was going after the real bad guys and not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of the midnight mission
bucky hits a speed bag building up a sweat
i told myself i didnt care
he hits the bag faster and faster
a desk officer hands bucky a note
a secretary leads bucky into an office with chief of detectives thad green etched on the pebble glass door
inside the office lee blanchard asst
ellis loew and chief thad green
they all sit in matched leather chairs
an awkward silence
getting to his feet gentlemen bucky bleichert
bucky chief thad green deputy da ellis loew
bucky shakes their hands nodding to each
chief green gestures for him to sit
read this aloud officer
its running in sundays times
before the war the city of the angels was graced with two local fighters born and raised a scant five miles apart pugilists with styles as different as fire and
lee blanchard was a bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger skip down to the fire and ice part
searching finding mr
fire and mr
ice never fought each other but a sense of duty brought them together in spirit and both joined the los angeles police department
blanchard cracked the baffling boulevard citizens bank robbery case in and captured thrill killer tomas dos santos bleichert served with distinction during the zoot suit wars a glance to lee
skip to the end
both men made great sacrifices to serve their city and on election day voters are going to be asked to do the same thing vote on a five million dollar
bond proposal to upgrade the lapds equipment and provide for an eight percent pay raise for all personnel
keep in mind the examples of mr
fire and mr

blanchard and green smile loew frowns
bs looking like a loser right now
but if we can drum up some publicity we may he able to get it passed in the special
we need to build up morale in the department
impress voters with the quality of our men
wholesome white boxers are a big draw bleichert
you know that
bucky looks to lee
fire and ice
the academy gym
three weeks from now
right before the election
all the gate to charity
after that we bring back the interdivisional boxing team
are you in bucky
its not like youll last the ten rounds anyway
bucky eyes lee quickly assessing his larger but slightly softer physique
all the remaining eyes are on him
back slaps and congratulations all around
im betting on great things from you bleichert
and if i dont miss my bet we may be colleagues soon
uh yes sir
bucky exits and sees lee leaning against an unmarked car talking with a striking woman in an auburn pageboy cut
lee waves bucky over
bucky id like you to meet kay lake
i saw you fight a couple times
i always won
you a fight fan
lee used to drag me
i was taking somme art classes so id sketch the boxers
lee puts his arm around her

he staggers around like a punch drunk fighter
ill try not to hurt you
a flicker of anger in her eyes

hes got money on me i gather

and if i win i get warrants
seems that way
bucky shakes his head
turns to kay
what do you think of all this miss lake
for moral reasons i hope the lapd gets ridiculed for perpetrating this farce
for financial reasons i hope lee wins
and for aesthetic reasons i hope you both look good with your shirts off
bucky and lee break into laughter
bucky sticks out his hand
lee takes it
luck short of winning
bucky tips his hat to kay and turns to go
he stops at hearing his real name
but he knows shes waiting to see his reaction so he keeps walking
bucky hits the heavy bag in the police gym while lee spars in the background the th street lieutenant tapped as official lapd bookmaker had lee as an early to
bucky runs through elysian park with two pound weights on his ankles
voice over contd while the real bookie line had mr
fire favored by knockout at to and decision by to
bucky spars with a fighter peppering him with jab after jab
voice over contd even the dicks in ad vice had suspended bookie shakedowns because mickey cohen was raking ten grand a day and kickin back five percent to the advertising
agency promoting the bond issue
cops exchange betting markers during roll call
voice over contd i was a local celebrity again
bucky pulls up in front of a small ugly house in a tired neighborhood
he exits the car carrying a cardboard box full of canned goods and old girlie magazines
a bony old man sits in a broken chair aiming a bb pistol at some balsa wood airplanes scattered in the yard
disgust and sadness
this is dolph bleichert buckys father
bucky approaches pulling a chair up next to his father
up close its even worse white skin stretched tight over blue veins yellow rimming his rheumy eyes
flecks of dirt and vomit on a filthy shirt
guten tag dwight
speak english papa
he aims the bb gun and fires at an airplane the guns empty
bucky enters the house
half eaten cans of beans on the dining room table an entire legion of broken balsa wood airplane kits
alley cats wander in and out of the kitchen nosing their faces into open tuna fish cans
dolph leans on the porch rail
say something papa
get me mad
tell me how you can fuck this place up so bad in one month
he searches his fathers eyes for a response and gets none
he surveys the house again
somewhere in the corner of his eye we see the glint of an idea
bucky on the phone
hes had another stroke
if you could just come by and clean the place up and keep an eye on him for week or so
a hundred dollars is fine
no more than ten days
bucky leans against a wall watching lee spar
mentally fighting the sparring partners fight
he was better than i thought
it made what came next easier
bucky sits at a desk with an assistant manager and fills out forms
the manager counts out approximately in cash
bucky slides him the forms
the manager slides him the cash
bucky slides into a booth across from pete lukins
im surprised but im not so surprised
i hear you been lookin good
bettern people think
bucky pushes an envelope across to pete
he looks in it
pete contd i guess what i hear is correct
then youll be wantin to place this with mickey cohens indie
hes got blanchard to im not bettin on me pete
a beat oh
another beat then as a friend i feel its my duty to tell you this you better make it look good
knockout between rounds eight and ten
pete nods his head thinking
dragnas got a guy really sold on you
best youre gonna get
pete sticks out his hand
short of winning
bucky takes his hand
bucky takes apart his sparring partner with a series of lightning quick counterpunches
id almost finished the police academy when the background check turned up my fathers german american bund membership
pressured by the fbi goons to confirm my patriotism i gave the alien squad sam murakawa a guy id grown up with in order to secure my lapd appointment
bucky watches from across the street as an off duty nurse tries to get papa bleichert to eat a sandwich
the old fuck never knew any better
never knew what he cost me
or sammy whod died at manzanar
i was a good fit in the snitchs jacket and with a little alteration i slipped easily into the whole suit
bucky watches lee spar
his quick eyes spying scar tissue over lees right eye lee dropping his left when throwing the right hook lee tucking his elbows too tight and opening up his ribcage
voice over contd i had traded warrants for a close out on bad old debts the eight grand i was gonna clear enough to maintain the old man in a good clean rest home for three years the late round tank job enough to convince myself i wasnt a complete coward
kay approaches bucky as he studies lee
at least he looks good with his shirt off
she waves to lee between rounds
he blows a kiss back
wheres your sketch pad
i was never very good
ended up with a degree in history
lees fight money paid for it
educations an expensive habit to kick
beat he shouldnt have quit fighting
i asked him to
besides catching animals gave him a sense of order
you have a girlfriend dwight
saving myself for rita hayworth
a roar from the gym onlookers
lees sparring partner hits the deck blood spraying from his mouth
bucky contd quits fighting for you
puts you through school
quite a guy
quite a pair
flirting were not getting married if thats what youre wondering
shackings against the regs
probably cost him a stripe
i have to go dwight
good luck tomorrow night
you didnt answer my question a throwaway lee and i dont sleep together dwight
she keeps walking
he just stares
a half eaten steak and two beers gone
its six hours later and buckys still thinking about kays exit line
he grabs his jacket
bucky flashes his badge to a late night clerk who escorts him into the newspapers morgue
pulls a bound stack of newspaper clippings and gives them to bucky
he begins poring through them
a newspaper photo of a bank shifts into live action an armored truck idles in front of the boulevard citizens bank
three men dressed in guard uniforms run out of the front of the bank an alarm keening in the background
three police cars converge on the scene and a gun battle ensues
two of the bank robbers are shot as the third man the one carrying the money jumps into the truck
the truck takes off able to escape when someone from inside the truck throws open the doors and pushes the naked and bound legitimate guards out the back and into
the line of pursuit
with no lead on the two escaped men the heist quickly went from page one to page five
two weeks later
a newspaper clipping headline tip from ex boxer cop breaks b c bank job a still photo of lee which becomes live action as
a younger lee and four other cops tear apart a small flat
in a closet they find bank guard uniforms bank bags and a small stash of marijuana
one of lees snitches fingered bobby dewitt a greasy little pimp with a yard long rap as the brains behind the bank job
voice over contd dewitt howled frame up the entire trial never iding the driver or coughing up the dough even after damning character testimony from some of his employees including
one katherine lake formerly of sioux falls south dakota and looking to go straight
voice over contd dewitt got ten to life at san quentin lee got kay or maybe the other way around
back to present bucky walks through downtown l
hands stuffed in his pockets like james dean
voice over contd they both got a few weeks in the gossip pages before kay dove into her college education and lee down the heros road ending in warrants and
a shack job with a woman he loved but wouldnt touch
bucky passes a whore on the corner their eyes meet for a moment and he walks on
voice over contd you come off a winning fight
sweat drenched tasting blood still wanting to go
the handbooks who made money on you bring you a girl
a pro a semi pro
you do it in the dressing room or a hallway
the eleventh round of a ten round fight
and when you go back to an ordinary life its just weakness a loss
bucky turns back to give the whore a second look but shes gone
voice over contd to a fighter sex tastes like blood and resin and suture scrub
i wondered if some day that would ever be different
and the fight is on
cops and mobsters sit shoulder to shoulder cigar smoke like l
haze as lee charges bucky the big man trying to cut of the ring
bucky engages dodging lees thundering blows and peppering back with counterpunches
the general fight storyline is this a very even and brutal match see sawing back and forth bucky doing all he can to make it into the middle rounds
somewhere around the fourth or fifth round his competitive juices take over and he begins trying to win at all costs
the two men hurt each other badly and in the eighth round its anybodys fight
bucky punches toe to toe with lee abandoning his strategy
lee knocks bucky out
bucky lies in bed radio playing jazz
he looks horrible face swollen lip split stitches across his nose
he sips whiskey from a bottle through a straw
the phone rings and rings
he refuses to answer it
bucky bruised but somewhat better stands in the hallway of a very nice rest home
he surreptitiously watches his father as the old man tries to grab at a nurse
pete lukins waits outside on the porch for bucky
hell catch on soon enough
the scene widens behind the two men and we see the sign on the facility jewish stars adorn the sign
bucky stands in front of his mirror clipping at his stitches with scissors
he hears a voice outside his window
bucky recognizes the voice and goes to the window
lee blanchard his own bruises fading stands in the yard
you gonna hide in there another week

harrells been callin to tell you

loews deal dont you read the papers

off lees devilish grin mister fire
the hero and the snitch
a door marked detectives muster room
bucky wearing his best sports coat and slacks pushes through the door
full of the lapds plainclothes hotshots
all stand and give bucky a standing ovation
lees there too playing to the crowd
on the blackboard at the front of the room
captain jack tierney is at the podium
as introduction officer bleichert the men of central dicks homicide ad vice bunco et cetera

tierney raps the podium and speaks again
tierney contd enough horseshit

first three liquor store stickups
tierney begins the summary as buckys eyes wander around the room taking in his new surroundings
older men coats and ties
he tunes back in
tierney contd and heres a collard please capn jack to no end
sergeants vogel koenig have you read the sid memos on the bunker hill burglaries
fritz vogel and bill koenig both hulking and unpleasant looking fritzie being the elder version of his son johnny

lets all take a look
the meetings breaking up
a tall elegant man russ millard and a squat disheveled man harry sears approach bucky
introducing himself russ millard homicides
wife and kids thank you for the raise officer
bucky smiles a dumb smile not knowing what to say
russ millard contd re the other man my partner harry sears

before bucky can answer ellis loew grabs him by the elbow and leads him away
welcome to central warrants when he gets him out of ear shot ellis loew contd you shouldnt have slugged with him
you were ahead on all three cards
the proposition passed sir
yes but some of your patrons lost money
play things smarter here
dont blow this like you blew the fight
buckys about to respond when lee saves him ready to roll canvasback
he grabs bucky and they head out the door
lee cruises them through downtown rambling about the job description
whyd you really quit fighting
he pulls the car into a parking lot of a mexican restaurant
matter of fact benny siegel bought out my contract scared off my manager
said hed get me a shot at joe louis if id take two dives for him
i said no joined the department cuz jew syndicate boys wont kill cops
as they exit the car one more
what are we doin here
while you were dancing with ellis at muster i checked maynard colemans kas on the bulletin and recognized the name of a fence
think he tends bar here
lee and bucky slide into a booth on either side of bruno albanese halfway through plate of huevos rancheros
who wants to know
police officers bruno
lets make this fast so i dont have to watch you eat
lee slides the maynard coleman mug shot to albanese
lee contd we know he sells to you and we dont care
where is he
never seen em before
and then grabs bruno by the back of the neck and jams his face into the hot cheese and goo of his food
brunos arms flap back and forth as lee drowns him in his food
finally lee shrugs and pulls brunos face out of his food blood from his nose mixing with the grease of the enchiladas
sixth and st
lee and bucky pull up and look for a parking spot just as maynard coleman trots down the front stairs and gets into a car
they ease the car back into traffic and follow colemans car from a safe distance
bucky picks up the two way radio
lee gestures for him to put it back colemans pulling into the parking lot of the polar palace an ice skating rink
coleman exits his car eyeing a group of kids carrying ice skates and heading into the polar palace
he follows them inside
the two men follow
children skate around on the ice with a giant polar bear suit
lee and bucky scan the area not an adult in sight
lee spots some stairs leading to the restrooms and gestures to bucky who hustles down them
maynard coleman carrying a stuffed bunny rabbit walks up the stairs toward bucky
just as the two men pass bucky pulls his gun and puts it to colemans head
youre under arrest
coleman throws his hands in the air the bunny drops to the ground
bucky cuffs coleman and leads him up the stairs as lee comes down from above
a small voice from below bucky let go of him
let go of him
bucky looks down to see a small boy pounding on his leg
the kids hysterical
let go a my daddy
the resemblance is unmistakable
two generations of okie white trash
bucky continues marching coleman the elder up the stairs as lee snags the kid both the father and the son crying like babies
lee and bucky fill out a release form for the desk officer
bucky looks up to see bill koenig and fritz vogel march by with barely a nod
they got here fast
off buckys look the confession
lee finishes typing up a report on a manual typewriter while bucky talks on the phone
he hangs up as fritz vogel and bill koenig return
lee contd re the two meatheads play nice
theyve got juice with loew
stupid and proud he confessed
kiddie porks and the burglaries
fritzie says were all getting commendations
buckys pov both koenig and vogel have small bits of blood spattered on their white dress shirts
ellis loves the kid angle
you talk to ellis
hes only ellis to lieutenants on up blanchard
least i dont call him kike
flushing cmon billy
the two men push by with barely a nod in buckys direction
harry sears approaches their cubicle
he looks a little drunk
and when you get to know him youll realize that when hes drunk he doesnt stutter
russ says good collar today
the men nod thanks
bucky notes the lack of stutter and the presence of a liquor smell
harry contd and lee i heard something you oughta know i was over at county parole bobby dewitt got an a number
hell be released to la around mid january
lee bobs his head slightly as harry moves off
hes disturbed but covers quickly you like pot roast
lee leads bucky up the walk
buckys impressed with the house

a dolls house of danish modern furniture fresh flowers and polished mahogany wainscoting

kay arrives from the kitchen smiling broadly at bucky
she takes his hand
glad you could make it
and holds his hand about two beats than usual
kay brings in the food
bucky walks around the room checking things out
fairy tale come true isnt it

cant say i believe in fairy tales

the food is finished

kay pops another one hitting lee in the chest with the cork

lee flashes a demon smile
a montage of shots as lee and bucky cruise south on crenshaw boulevard
the beginning of the post war boom
from november through the new year lee and i captured a total of eleven hard felons eighteen traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders
on crenshaws northern end once grand and now dilapidated houses in the process of demolition their faces replaced by giant billboards advertising department stores jumbo shopping centers and movie theaters
after tours of duty lee and i would go to the house and find kay
sometimes she made dinner for us other times the three of us would go dancing or see a flick
southbound older wooden structures looking more and more unkempt
voice over contd always shed be there never in between us but always in the middle
it was the best time of my life
lee pulls the car into the parking lot
jumping out of the car this grand tour stuffs for shit
im callin in some favors
he heads to a payphone and beings pumping coins into it
lee gets back in the car
hes pale sweating
got a tip
snitch a mine says hes shacking with some poon in a crib near slauson and hoover
its all colored down there we fuckin roll
he pulls out
lee and bucky roll up on four men loitering on a corner
three are black and one is white
lets shake em for an address or a name
as lee and bucky exit the car the four men immediately start the slow walk to the wall arms over their heads
the white guy glances at lee what the blanchard
shut up shitbird
lee pushes him closer to the wall and starts frisking him
bucky starts with one of the other men pulling out some marijuana cigarettes
out of the corner of his eye bucky sees the black man closest to lee reaches for something shiny in his belt partner
bucky pulls his
the white guy swings around and lee shoots him twice in the face the first black man pulls a shiv free and bucky shoots him in the neck another of
the men goes for his trousers fumbling for something as bucky shoots him three times
bucky hits the cement and gets an upside down view of lee and the last man drawing guns on each other lees three shots cutting down the man before he
can fire his tiny derringer
bucky pulls himself to his feet stumbling past the blood covered sidewalk and vomits in the gutter
bucky pulls out his badge and pins it to his jacket pocket
behind him lee is busy turning the dead mens pockets inside out scattering shivs and reefers onto the sidewalk away from the blood
all the while lee cries like a baby
bucky and a detective exit a de briefing room
bucky looks worn but composed
thank you for your time officer
and your police work as well
they pass another de briefing area where lee sits with another detective
lee looks terrible muttering and shivering
detective contd your partners taking this hard
he knew one of the guys
busted him once for loitering
sort of liked the guy
the detective nods sympathetically
lee and bucky walk up the front steps where theyre met by kay
she runs to lee and embraces him
she escorts him into the house
bucky sees a newspaper on the front porch railing
the evening edition of the mirror
boxer cops in gun battle
four crooks dead
publicity boxing photos accompany a full page article
bucky begins to read it when he hears from inside leave me alone
youll never fucking understand a door slam
soon after the sound of lees motorcycle roaring off
after a beat kay comes outside and sits down next to bucky
he knew one of the guys
bucky contd it was them or us
she nods again
bucky contd tomorrows off duty so treat him nice bobby dewitt gets out in a week dwight
were on edge
he swore at the trial he was going to kill lee
we can take care of bobby dewitt
you dont know bobby
i know as much as i need to know
kay gives him a look thats what you think
she gets up and goes inside
not knowing what to do bucky continues reading the paper
bucky wanders inside obviously fidgety and not wanting to go home
he putters around their living room
from the back of the house bucky hears the sound of a shower running
bucky walks back to the bathroom drawn there by the sound of the drumming water
the bathroom door is open an invitation
he stops at the threshold of the bathroom
his pov kay stands in the shower curtain open for buckys benefit
she faces him and he takes in the view of her nakedness
her attitude is not one of seduction however her expression passive and fixed even when their eyes meet
she pirouettes for him showing the history of bobby dewitt
bucky backs away retreating as he chokes back tears
buckys awakened by the phone ringing
he pulls the receiver off the cradle but leaves it on the nightstand
from the receiver he barely hears rise and shine partner
bucky grabs the phone
ran mulholland at a hundred and ten
played house with kay all day yesterday
feel like doing some police work
junior nashs got a fuck pad on norton and coliseum
bucky and lee pull up to a mangy apartment building
they push the door open to reveal a filthy little flop littered with muscatel short dogs and used rubbers
they poke around for a minute finding nothing
the smell is awful
bucky goes to a window and pulls it open
a cluster of uniformed cops and men in civilian clothes stare at something in the weeds
a coroners van parks next to three black and whites and two detectives sedans
lee goes to the window
is that millard and sears
an lapd photo van pulls up next
lee and bucky sprint out of the room
photo men have already begun fanning out and taking photos
bucky sees harry sears take a shot from a hip flask in full view of other officers
lee and bucky elbow their way to the front and see the nude mutilated body of a young woman cut in half at the waist
another wide cut down her center reveal an empty cavity her organs have been removed
her face has been bashed in and her mouth cut ear to ear in a leering smile
even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene
they point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief and disorder when whistles harshly with his fingers in his mouth
before this gets out of hand lets put the kibosh on something
if this gets a lot of publicity were going to get a lot of confessions
so we keep some things quiet
this girl was disemboweled
you keep this information to yourselves
not your wives not your girlfriends no other officers
the men all nod coming together as millard takes control
russ millard contd no reporters view the body
you photo men take your pictures now
coroners men you put a sheet on the body as soon as theyre done
set up a perimeter six feet back
any reporter crosses it arrest him
noticing bucky bleichert
what are you doing here
bucky indicates lee crouched down by the body taking notes
nash is renting a room in that building over there
blood on the premises
this isnt him
the labll be the judge of that
millard and bucky look dawn the street to see cars swinging onto norton beelining for the commotion
reporters and photographers begin pouring out of their cars quickly coming up against a line of cops keeping them from the body
bucky makes his way over to lee unable to stop staring at the body
junior nash remember
he didnt do this
he beat an old woman to death
thats why hes our priority warrantee
this aint ours partner on edge it is now partner
too sheet covered stretchers are shoved into the coroners wagon
the doors slam shut and the car pulls away
as fifteen officers including lee and bucky wait for their assignment
cops ring doorbells throughout leimert park to an old woman have you heard female screams
to an off duty serviceman anyone discarding womens clothing
to a little kid seen anyone in the lot on th
to a housewife and what about this man
holds out a photo of junior nash to all of these questions a big fat no
bucky watches two mexican bantamweights beat each other bloody
an empty seat next to him
irritated he gets up and leaves
bucky gets out of his car and finds lee standing inside the crime scene rope watching lab techs poke around in the weeds
the entire area is lit up by arclights illuminating the two quicklime outlines of the body parts
you were supposed to meet me at the fights tonight remember
priority for the bureau
not for us
nice white girl gets snuffed
gotta show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue
its a showcase
its a plus buck
we dont miss this
weve had enough headlines for the week
lee points to the body outline
his hand shakes a bit and maybe for the first time we sense hes wired on something
with or without you partner
bucky shakes his head and begins walking away
lee contd with or without you
i heard you
bucky enters a mob scene
one cop holds up a front page headline hunt werewolfs den in torture slaying along a bench five derelict looking men are manacled to a bench
a cop walks by notes buckys confusion confessors
just then the interrogation room door opens and bill koenig leads a doubled over fat man out of the door
he didnt do it
a couple officers clap satirically at their desks
to another cop blanchard
in with loew
beat and reporters
off buckys concerned look we bucky walks in to see loew holding a press conference lee dressed in a suit and sitting at his side
and the heinous nature of this killing makes it imperative to catch this fiend as soon as possible
a number of specially trained officers including mr
fire and his partner mr
lee catches up with a pissed off bucky
you got us detached
slow and easy bucky
first i gave loew a memo saying nash blew our jurisdiction you did what
its all right
the apb still stands
weve got the pad staked
buckys face says hes not sold on lees reasoning
lee contd one week
just one week
after that its back to junior
bucky studies lees resolve he relents
lee contd copacetic
antiseptic white with metallic slab tables
two objects covered in sheets lay on the table
bucky lee russ millard and harry sears sit on benches facing the table
the coroner and a stenographer nun stand over the body
the coroner pulls the sheets off
on gross pathology we have a female caucasian between sixteen and thirty
cadaver is presented in two halves with bisection level with the umbilicus
the nun scribbles furiously to keep up
the officers are torn between staring at their shoes and at the body
coroner contd through and through laceration from both mouth corners
no visible signs of neck bruises
massive depressed skull fractures
inspection of upper half abdominal cavity reveals no free flowing blood
intestines stomach liver and spleen removed
the doctor stops to allow the nun time to catch up
russ millard clears his throat
all right to smoke doctor
shes not going to mind
both russ and harry light up
coroner contd lower half of the cadaver reveals removal of reproductive organs
both legs broken at the knee and healing light lash marks on the upper back and shoulders
the door opens and a police officer enters handing a sheet of paper to millard and speaking to him briefly
millard reads the sheet and hands it to harry who then hands it to lee
he hands it to bucky
the note girl idd as elizabeth ann short dob medford mass
the coroner steps back from the table
whats your best guess
heres what she wasnt
she wasnt raped she wasnt pregnant dried semen indicates voluntary intercourse within the last week
she took what id call a gentle whipping in the last ten days
in terms of the nitty gritty
she was probably tortured with a knife for thirty six to forty eight hours before death
the cause of which is either the mouth wound or more likely she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat
what about her insides
they came out after death
then id say he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean probably in a bathtub
did the guy know anything about medicine or anatomy
probably not a surgeon type but that doesnt rule out veterinary training biological training or my pathology for beginners class at ucla
has she got a name yet
the cops look to each other hesitant to speak her name
saluting heaven god love you elizabeth
to millard russell when you get the son of a bitch who did this to her give him a kick in the balls and tell him its from frederick d
now all of you get out of here ive got a date with a jumper suicide in ten minutes
jack tierney posts mug shots of elizabeth short as russ harry lee and bucky look over his shoulder
in the background we can hear the by now constant droning of ellis loew to reporters both in person and over the phone cops popped her in
other than that shes clean
fathers here in la
hear he sold some old portrait photos of her to the herald
russ makes a noise of disgust
how many confessions so far
double that by morning
more if loew got the press excited with his purple prose
hes been eavesdropping id say my prose fits the crime lieutenant
reveal loew with koenig and fritz vogel behind him
too much publicity is a hindrance ellis
if you were a policeman youd know that
loew flushes and gives millard a dark look
to tierney captain have you sent men to talk to the victims father
not yet ellis
how about vogel and koenig
tierney looks to millard
the second in command shakes his head ever so slightly
we understand that even though hes second in command to jack hes in charge
aaah russ who do you think we should send
a garage apartment at the rear of a big victorian house
lee and bucky amble up and ring the buzzer
a skinny man cleo short in his fifties opens the door eyeing them narrowly
he leads them inside
the apartment resembles its resident soiled worn and ugly
cleo short contd ive got an alibi just in case you think i did it
tighter than a crabs ass and that is air tight
the two cops sit down sizing up his hostility
im detective bleichert mr
this is sergeant blanchard

i promised her three squares and a five spot if she kept the house tidy
the cops look around at the squalor
cleo short contd gave her the boot in july
she moved to santa barbara

some soldier beat her up bad
last i heard from her
was that soldier her boyfriend
the old man lets out a hoot
they were all her boyfriends
not so ugly and wearing a uniform cant go wrong there
betty believed in quantity before quality
you calling your own daughter a tramp
got five daughters
one bad apple aint so bad
lees about to burst
bucky motions for him to take a walk
lee goes through the den into the bathroom
from his view bucky can see lee chase a couple pills with a glass of water
any names mr
tom dick harry
he drifts for a moment said she was looking for movie work but
just paraded the boulevard in those black get ups of hers
lee returns to the room
cleo short contd who wouldnt get herself killed doin that
the two men walk out disgusted
we just got handed the entire u
armed forces as suspects
flip to see who writes it up
im staking nashs pad for the night
see if we get any strange drive bys at the murder sight
do me a favor and drop in on kay
shes worried about me
shes a smart woman
bucky opens the front door to find kay reading a book on the couch
she doesnt even look up
howd you know it was me
lee stomps you tread lightly
bucky appreciates her subtext
lees let me guess
lees up all night probably on benzedrine again working that poor girls murder she says this as fact not judgement
she knows him
youre worried about him
and hes worried about me
beat but whos worried about you
is that left for me
no need for that
for such a cautious man youre quite a hardcase
hes done a lot for me
kay smiles sweeps her arms around the perfect living room as if to reinforce to bucky all lees done for her
the point is not lost on him
she crosses to him and kisses him softly on the cheek
kay contd good night
bucky sits at their kitchen table eating a ham sandwich with a glass of milk and filling out the police reports
bucky walks in reading the herald front page a picture of elizabeth short in a striking black dress
underneath the black dahlia
he stops at a room where two detectives are sorting through a steamer trunk full of letters and assorted personal effects
re trunk found it in storage down at the railway
carbons of mash notes to sailors
hundreds of em
bucky shows him the newspaper
thank our friend bevo means at the herald
bevos painting betty and her black dress like some actress in that alan ladd movie the blue dahlia
should triple our confessions
russ millard contd hollywood will fuck you when no else will
what do you think
i think i want to go back to warrants
youre a bright penny and i want you here
hands him a piece of paper bettys last known residences and kas
go to university station and pick up bill koenig
keep bill on a tight leash and you write the report because billys practically illiterate
lieutenant call me russ and get out of here
millard gestures for him to leave
bucky and koenig walk up to the steps of an apartment house
how do you want to play this sarge
fritzie usually does the talking and i stand back up
re a leather sap in his belt muscle job
lets try talk job
bucky checks names on the doorbells against a couple names on his piece of paper
he stops at s
bucky knocks on the door
a young woman dressed in a metallic egyptian costume opens the door
you the driver from rko
the woman shuts the door
seconds later the toilet flushes
she returns and opens it again
if this is about those jaywalking its about elizabeth short
i did all this on the phone this morning
nine thousand questions about bettys nine thousand boyfriends and i dont remember any of the names
can i go now
the extras truck is due any minute
how about you sit dawn and answer my questions or i bust you for the reefer you flushed
she lets him in and sits defiantly
bucky contd first question
re to his paper linda martin or a marjorie graham live here
thats bettys other place
delongpre and orange
she moved around quite a bit
you know why
was somebody threatening her
bettys problem wasnt enemies
it was too many friends
ive gathered that
lets change the subject
how bout the world of high finance
bucky contd how about movies
you girls are all tryin to break in right
re her extras costume im in mister
what about betty
round thanksgiving she showed up bragging about gettin her big break
had one of those viewfinders around her neck
but who knows where she really got it
betty had a tendency to stretch the truth
a car horn honks
bucky walks to the window and looks outside a flatbed truck full of cleopatras waits
your rides here but shes already gone
they cruise to the next address
whatd the cooze say bout me
bucky just stares at him the guys an idiot
two men lounge on the stoop
koenig gives them the eye as he passes
bucky checks his piece of paper against the doorbells again
graham but no linda martin
thisll just take a minute
im gonna take those two guys outside
maybe they knew the cooze ill handle em sarge no
im gonna do it
beat now what do i roust em about
ask em anything
see if betty ever engaged in prostitution
koenig goes running outside
bucky shakes his head
marjorie graham sits on a couch with a dog eared back issue of photoplay in her hands
shes mild but well traveled
betty had this gift you see
she was so sweet and eager to please
a bit dumb maybe
but shed do anything to be liked become whatever you wanted her to be
shed walk like you or talk like you
but she wasnt
she was still her
did she ever tell you she was in a movie
sometime around november
she had this viewfinder and showed it around to all the guys
said it was from the director
a co starring role
did she say what it was
once she said it was for fox
another time paramount
i think she was just fibbing
you know for the boys
do you remember the names of any of the guys
don and harold sitting outside
she dated both of em once or twice
other than that
didnt really pay attention to who she was with
marjorie looks down fidgeting
what is it
you can tell me
right before she moved out
l saw her and linda
her and linda martin talking to this older woman up on the boulevard
she had a mans suit and short hair like a man
only that one time
are you saying the woman was a lesbian
marjorie nods yes
buckys about to press her for more when bill koenig barges in all sweaty
them guys talked
said the stiff peddled her twat when she got strapped bad
i called it in
loew said to keep it zipped cuz it dont look as good
bucky looks at marjorie
back to koenig
take their statements bill
ive got a little more here
bill disappears back to the porch
bucky contd linda martins room
bucky pushes open the room and finds it empty
he checks the closet
bucky runs his hand under the bed
finds something and pulls it out
a small red vinyl purse
he opens the purse
inside is an id
he shows it to marjorie
shes only fifteen
re card lorna martikova
whend you see her last
i told her id called the police to come talk to us about betty
was that the wrong thing to do
you couldnt have known
koenig stands on the stoop with the two men both of whom look like they might have seen the wrong end of koenigs less than subtle interrogation style
re the men they didnt do it
no shit sherlock
clapsticks come down in front of the camera elizabeth short
elizabeth short sits on a tiny chair in a cheap office
shes dressed for an audition overly made up and nervous
your name please
she nods cant relax
can we try it again
we havent even started yet
bucky fills out forms
i used a warrant cops special prerogative and issued an apb on lorna martikova aka linda martin
i wrote up my days report omitting marjorie grahams lead on the old dyke
i didnt need ellis loew quashing it along with the skinny on betty as the part time prostie
bucky pulls up in front of the house
voice over contd to be honest id pretty much overdosed on betty shorts low rent last months on earth and decided to kiss off the rest of the day and
head to lee and kays for a sandwich
spread out on lee and kays dining room table
bucky stands just inside the door watching lee study the photos kay a pace or two back smoking nervously
neither of them seem to notice him
finally kay sees him hi dwight
wired it aint a random job
guy who did this
wanted the whole goddamn world to know
babe you took pre med whattya think
lee dwights here
oh hey partner
bucky listen to kay
babes got ideas
good stuff this kind of theorizings nonsense but ill give you a theory if youll eat something to calm yourself down
theory on teach
just a guess
but maybe there were two killers
because the torture cuts are crude while the bisection and the cut on the abdomen are neat and clean
close on lees face somehow both intense and unfocused
three days til bobby de witt hit la
three days since we killed four men
back on bucky who turns on his heels and exits catching kays eye as he goes
voice over contd maybe nobody cared
maybe they cared too much
bucky cruises by the crime scene
rubberneckers gawk around the vacant lot while vendors peddle greasy food and cheap portrait glossies of the dahlia in a black dress
bucky sits at his desk staring at raymond nashs mugshot
a wager pool sign up list posted on the wall a crude felt craps table with various betting spaces solved to random sex job to uhsolved even money boyfriend s
next to it are two halves of a black dress on separate hangers
a crude joke
bucky opens up his desk drawer and drops the nash mugshot inside
he dials the phone administrative vice squad
bucky pulls his car up to a low slung building with a log cabin facade and swinging western doors
a dimly lit lesbian bar
butch women in gi khakis mix with soft girls in cashmere skirt suits
bucky approaches a bartender
the woman sizes him up and slides him a whiskey
downing the whiskey lapd homicide
who got snuffed
bucky slides her a photo of the dahlia and linda martins id
seen either of em
the dahlias a sister
you tell me
never seen her cept in the papers
and the little schoolgirl twist ive never seen
we dont truck with underaged stuff
capice when your girls tell me that
as the photos are passed from patron to patron
aside from a few raised eyebrows over the dahlia nothing to indicate anyone knows anything
this time an olde english motif
bucky sips another free whiskey as a dozen more women pass the photos around
bucky watches their reactions closely but doesnt see anything out of the ordinary
he takes another shot of whiskey and heads out the door
a tropical motif
faux bamboo wrap around booths shield women snuggled deep into the dark corners
a bit buzzed and embarrassed to have to go booth to booth and break up couples bucky slowly makes his way around the bar with the two photos
more of the same
he approaches a woman polishing glasses at the bar
slides over the photos
he taps a finger onto linda martins id
what about this girl
the bartender picks up the card and squints at it
bucky sees a flicker of recognition in her eyes
she hesitates never seen her
he leans over the counter
dont you fuckin lie to me
shes fifteen fucking years old
so you come clean or i slap a contributing beef on you and you spend the next five years servin raisinjack to bulldykes in tehachapi
the bartender looks again at the id card
a couple times
two three months ago
just to cadge drinks off the sisters though
she liked boys im sure
and not the dahlia
out of his peripheral vision bucky sees another woman just starting to sit down on a bar stool but at the last minute change her mind and make for the
a baby spotlight catches her face a fleeting resemblance to elizabeth short
bucky takes a deep breath counts to ten and then goes out after the woman
the woman gets into a beautiful snow white packard
as bucky tails the white packard from three car lengths back
he follows her all the way from the valley to hancock park
as the woman parks her car in front of a huge tudor mansion bucky cruises by catching her license plate and writing it on a pack of matches from lavernes
in his rear view mirror he sees her exit the car a striking figure in a sharkskin suit
he watches her walk up the enormous lawn and into the home
bucky reads the license plate into the phone
he receives information back and writes it onto the matchbook as well
bucky lies in his bed staring at the ceiling
his bedside light reveals a still life elizabeth shorts mug shot photo tucked underneath the matchbook
the cover is flipped open and we can see written madeleine cathcart sprague
buckys listening to the dexter gordon quartet on the radio when the tune is interrupted by a feverish voice we interrupt our regular broadcast to bring you a bulletin
a major suspect in the investigation of elizabeth short the raven haired beauty known as the black dahlia has been captured
red manley a huntington park hardware salesman and one of the last men to be seen with the dahlia was captured early this morning
currently being held at hollenback station bucky takes a quick left down another street
bucky runs into lee as he enters the station
dahlia left san diego six days before we found her
dago cops got a witness puts her in a tan dodge with a partial plate ident
finally got a cross check that matched on red here
seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a small corridor watching russ millard interrogate red manley through a one way mirror
manley is carrot topped and scared shitless
millards soothing voice can be heard through speakers
like i said robert
were doing this because you didnt come forward
ive told it three times now
i didnt want my wife to know i was chipping her
but you said you didnt chip on her
betty wouldnt put out
thats no reason to hide from the police
i dated her down in dago
i slow danced with her
its the same thing as chipping
and you wanted to fuck her didnt you
to test my loyalty to my wife
come on son
i wanted to fuck her
but she cock teased you
she said she had her period all of the cops outside laugh
said the father of her child would be a combat veteran and you were in the army band
you get angry
i told you
i didnt kill her
you drove her back to la with you on
and dropped her at the biltmore hotel
ive told it how many ways
how many more ways do you went to hear it
millard straightens up and turns to the one way mirror
he tugs at the knot of his tie
soon after he slips out of the room and harry sears slips in
bucky turns to lee
welcome back to earth partner
your fault really
after you left kay slipped me a mickey
slept for seventeen hours
your fault for buying her all those chemistry classes
learn anything interesting
re the interrogation now youll see why russ keeps harry around
harry circles red manley lightly tapping a metal studded sap in his hand
re the sap russs only rule
no actual hitting
harry leans close to red tapping the sap on the table
his stutter completely gone
you wanted some fresh gash and you thought betty was easy
you came on strong and that didnt work
you offered her money
she told you she was on the rag and that was the final straw
you wanted to make her bleed for real no no no
not betty harry smashes the sap onto a glass ashtray shattering it
red bites down on his lip cutting it
you plied betty with drinks got her to talk about her old boyfriends and came on like a pal like the nice little corporal willing to leave betty to the
real men the men who saw combat no harry smashes the table again
you took her to a toolshed maybe one of those abandoned warehouses out by the old ford plant in pico rivera
there was some twine and lots of cutting tools lying around and you got a hard on
no no no again harry smashes the table
red almost topples his chair backwards out of fear only harrys hand an the back slats keeping it from going over
yes reddy yes
you thought of every girl who said i dont suck every time your mommy spanked you every evil eye you got from real soldiers when you played your trombone in
the army band
no harry sears contd goldbrick needle nick pussy whipped no thats what betty had to pay for wasnt it
god as my witness
god hates liars
harry sears contd tell me red
i didnt hurt her tell god
harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls the whole thing over onto its side
red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees
he clasps his hands together the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
he begins to weep
harry turns to the one way mirror looking straight out at his audience self loathing etched into his flabby juicehound face
he gives the thumbs down sign and walks out of the room
russ millard meets him at the door and leads him away from the general crowd of officers
bucky watches as lee and another officer handcuff red and take him outside
lee has his hand on reds shoulder like a kindly uncle
bucky stands on the steps taking fresh air
russ steps out
good report yesterday bleichert
you send me back to warrants
but keep going
canvass around the biltmore
if red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched
youre doing well bucky
run with the ball
all i know is you should keep an eye on loew and his boys
i didnt put it in my report but betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough and loews been trying to keep it kiboshed so itll look better
if he ever takes it to trial
smiles you calling your boss an evidence suppressor
and a grandstanding son of a bitch
youre a brighter penny than i thought
hands him a sheet of paper betty sightings
i need smart pennies to eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet
what are you gonna do
keep an eye on the evidence suppressor son of a bitch and his minions to make sure they dont try to coerce a confession out of that innocent man in
the holding tank
he pats bucky on the shoulder and walks inside
restaurants bars juke joints
bucky interviews every drunk on western and normandie
the longer i listened the more they talked about themselves interweaving their sad tales with the black dahlia who they actually believed to be a glamorous siren headed for hollywood
bucky cruises in his car into lee and kays neighborhood
voice over contd it was as if they would have traded their own lives for a juicy front page death
i decided my report would consist of two words all bullshit
bucky pulls up just as kay storms out the door and down the steps hurling an armful of paper onto the lawn
lee storms beside her shouting and waving his arms as they go back inside
bucky walks over and kneels down besides the papers carbons of lapd report forms tip sheets evidence tickets the autopsy
all with e
short typed at the top
kay and lee come back out again kay tossing out more files
its sick and its insane
and all that might happen i need this babe
you know it
ill rent a room for the stuff but noticing bucky you tell her bucky
reason with her
shes right lee
youve pulled at least three misdemeanors here
its out of control bucky stops himself short studying lees strained face
bucky contd to kay i promised him a week on it
four more days and its over
dwight you can be so gutless sometimes
she turns on them both and goes back inside
before lee can make a wisecrack bucky kicks his way through the lapd papers back to his car
bucky sits low in his car watching the white packard parked near the front of lavernes
hes been there awhile
finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for her car
he jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her while shes fumbling for her keys
slumming miss sprague
she sighs exasperated
i am now
daddy spying on me again
she pulls a wad of cash out of her purse
switching to a very deft imitation of a scotchmans burr madeleine contd maddy girl ye shouldnt be congregatin in such unsuitable places im a policeman
well thats a new one she peels off another bill
hands it to bucky
he counts it out
over a hundred dollars
he hands the money back
bucky contd lets try elizabeth short
all of her bravado drops
bucky sees it immediately
he grabs her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car
bucky contd here or downtown
i know you knew her so dont jerk me off on that or its downtown and a whole lot of publicity
she opens the door to her car and slides in
bucky gets in next to her
by the roof light he can see that her similarity to the dahlia is more in her clothes and hair but the resemblance is still there nonetheless
gathering herself this is all a fluke
i met them at lavernes last fall
betty maybe one time
linda a couple
shed come in to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister
you sleep with either of them
just cocktail lounge chitchat
are you lez
scotchmans burr ye might say i take it where i can find it laddie
buckys charmed by her but stays focused
whyd you rabbit last night
exasperated mister my father is emmett sprague
the emmett sprague
he built half of hollywood and long beach and what he didnt build he bought
imagine the headlines
tycoons daughter questioned in black dahlia case played footsie with dead girl at lesbian nightclub
get the picture
beat what did you talk about
linda talked about her boring boy back in hicktown nebraska or wherever
betty talked about the latest issue of screen world
hollywood dreams the sad nine yards
betty ever tell you about a movie she did
show you a viewfinder
on a conversational level they were right down there with you only they were better looking
look im tired
you want to hear my alibi so i can end this farce and go home
thats all anyone ever wants to volunteer the alibi
my family and i were at our house in laguna from sunday through thursday along with our live in servants
if you want verification call daddy
but be discreet about where we met
she turns in the seat to face him directly
madeleine contd dont suppose i can convince you to keep my name out of the papers
i dont need your cash if thats what youre saying
she touches his leg
s not what im saying
he knows exactly what shes saying
my address is so
i know the address
pick me up
like a gentleman
he starts to get out of the car
madeleine contd one more thing whats your name
ill try to remember
he pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys
as he walks away he lets out a deep breath as if hed been holding it the whole time
bucky enters and finds lee at a desk manning the tip phones
a werewolf and red manley
the werewolf is red manley
yes that would be more efficient
lee dutifully writes down the crank on a routing slip
bucky slides into a chair across from him brushing imaginary dust off of the phone in front of him
lee rings off
smiles at bucky
lee contd i love tip duty
you smooth things with kay
i rented a room for the stuff at the el nido motel
nine scoots a week
chump change if it makes her feel good
de witt gets out tomorrow lee
i was thinking maybe i should lean on him
get fritz vogel and koenig to do it lee swings away in his rotating chair knocking over a wastepaper basket
bucky contd lee the phone in front of lee rings
he snatches it blanchard
lee listens to the call not saying anything
it goes on for some time
finally bucky catches lees eye
lee makes the looney sign with his finger
buckys phone rings
he picks it up
the person on the other line starts rambling on
bucky takes notes diligently as we buckys on another call
his pile of tip sheets and routing slips have grown
behind him lee pulls on his jacket and gives bucky a two fingered salute as he saunters out
i logged forty six phone tips about half of which were reasonably coherent
lee left early dodging any talk about de witt
ellis loew stuck me with writing up the summary report most of which concerned the numerous dead end leads bogus confessions and three hundred new dahlia sightings per day
it left me gut certain of one thing as bucky drops twenty dollars on unsolved pay to
elizabeth short in another dress her hair fixed differently
clapsticks come in again elizabeth short
screen test where are you from
how long have you lived here
youve lost your accent
well you know when in rome
looks nervously into camera why
do you want a girl with an accent
bucky rings the bell dressed in his sunday best blazer
madeleine answers a knockout in a skirt and cashmere sweater
i hate to pull this but daddy has heard about you
he insisted you stay for dinner
i told him we met at that art exhibit at stanley roses bookshop so if you have to pump everybody for my alibi be subtle
she leads him inside
thick persian carpets tapestries giant rooms with a mens club atmosphere
next to the fireplace bucky notices a stuffed spaniel with a yellowed newspaper rolled into its mouth
re the dog thats balto
the paper is the la times for august
balto was bringing in the paper when daddys accountant told him hed made his first million
daddy wanted to consecrate the moment so he shot him
here we go the sprague family sits in matching easy chairs
no one stands up
may i present my family
my mother ramona cathcart sprague
my father emmett sprague
my sister martha mcconville sprague
emmett sprague jumps to his feet pumping buckys hand
a pleasure mr
saw you fight mondo sanchez
boxed the pants off him
another billy conn you were
mondo gave a good show
what ever happened to him
died of a heroin overdose
shamed his family
beat speaking of families both martha and ramona stand up
martha is plain and serious with a tenacious resemblance to emmett
neither of whom look much like madeleine
ramona on the other hand possesses a pushing fifty resemblance to madeleine combined with the flaccid face and unfocused features of a booze or drug addict
trace of a slur madeleine says nice things about you
daddy can we eat
bucky and i want to catch a nine thirty show
a black maid serves large portions of corned beef and cabbage
dig in lad
hearty fare breeds hearty people
haute cuisine breeds degenerates
bucky smiles politely and begins eating
i want to draw mr
on emmetts nod martha pulls out a small sketch pad
youre in for a cruel caricaturing bucky
maddys my pretty one but marthas my certified genius
a wince from martha
emmett sprague contd what kind of name is bleichert
a great people the germans
hitler was a bit excessive but mark my words that someday well regret not joining forces with him to fight the reds
i killed a lot of your countrymen during the war
did you meet balto out in the hallway
an old friend stuffed him
we were in the scots regiment together
he wanted to work in the flickers
so when did you come here
hollywood was a cow pasture but the silent flickers was booming
georgie got work as a lighting man and me building houses
georgie got me introduced to mack sennett and i helped him build that housing project he was putting up hollywoodland underneath that godawful sign
i always loved the keystone kops
old mack knew how to squeeze a dollar dry he did
he had extras moonlighting as laborers and vice versa
i used to drive em over to hollywoodland after twelve hours on a keystone cops flicker and put in another six hours by torchlight
even gave me as assistant director credit a couple times so grateful he was for the way i squeezed his slaves a screech interrupts emmetts monologue
bucky looks across the table to see ramona trying to corral a potato with her fork the source of the sound
emmett sprague contd mother
are you feeling well
would you like to contribute to the conversation
ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily
did you know mr
bleichert that ramona boulevard was named after me
sprague i didnt
when emmett married me for my fathers money he promised my family that he would use his influence with the city zoning board to have a street named after me
but all he could manage was a dead end block in a red light district in lincoln heights
are you familiar with the neighborhood mr
i grew up there
then you know that the mexican prostitutes expose themselves out of windows to attract customers
i hear many of them know mr
sprague by name emmett sprague slams the table
bucky stares into his lap as madeleine grabs his knee tightly
ramona contd ill sing for my supper when mayor bowron comes to dinner but not for madeleines male whores
a common policeman
my god emmett
how little you think of me
she struggles to her feet and leaves the room
her husband follows
im so sorry
martha tears a piece of paper out of her sketch pad
bucky takes it as she walks away
a caricature of a naked bucky having sex with madeleine
a cinderblock auto court filled with pre war jalopies
the camera closes on a dingy door
a single yellow light illuminates the dreary flop as bucky and madeleine fuck on the bed
dont hate my family dont theyre not so bad bucky grabs her hair not them me
be with me
focusing madeleine pins bucky with her knees and pulls him deep into her until theyre no longer common policeman and rich girl slut
they hold each other sweaty and spent
i think you kept your name out of the papers
until we announce the wedding
your mother would love that
shes a hypocrite
she takes pills the doctor gives her so shes not a hophead
you know how daddy really made his money
he bought rotten lumber and abandoned movie facades from mack sennett and built houses out of them
hes got firetraps all over la registered to phony corporations
his good friend george
disfigured in a car crash while running daddy some errands
daddy throws him scraps now odd jobs tending some rental property you dont have to tell me this i want to
i like you bucky
i like you too
she looks at him earnestly
bucky i didnt tell you all about betty short
jesus dont be mad at me
i just dont want to lie to you
what is it
last summer i was bar hopping a lot
i heard about a girl who looked like me
i got curious and left notes at a couple places your lookalike wants to meet you things like that
i left my number
thats how i met her at lavernes with linda
and thats all of it
thats all of it
then be prepared babe
theres fifty cops out there combing every bar in town looking for dahlia info
you could be headed for the papers no matter what
serve my family right
you dont mean that
he strokes her dark hair
tell me something
whyd you want to meet betty short
ive worked pretty hard to be loose and free
but the way people described betty
it sounded like she was a natural
how do you mean
she was this poor girl
came from nothing
but then she carried nothing with her either
i dont know
when youre rich sometimes you romanticize the poor
i wouldnt know
an awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth
he studies her for a moment
pulls her close kisses her mouth
the arch of her neck
they begin to move together again
another lapd form witness report lorna martikova
aka linda martin
bucky weaves fast through traffic
he whips a right turn
buckys car screeches into the parking lot just as linda martin bursts through the doors and takes off running
bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her the girl clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in and out of busy traffic
the girl runs like a fucking antelope as bucky barely misses being hit by a large beer truck and gets to the other side of the street just as linda
stumbles over a curb sending her sprawling on the sidewalk
bucky jumps on her grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and screams like a hell cat
he cuffs her and pulls her up dragging her to where she spilled her purse
im an emancipated minor and if you touch me without a matron present ill sue you
he picks it up her purse
surprised by the heft he opens it and pulls out a metal film can
her demeanor changes instantly to fear near tears please mister
russ harry and bucky sit opposite linda martin
shes pretty and small and about to get smaller
and you dont recall any of the names betty went out with last fall
they were just pickups
no one who would do her harm
the girl thinks hard shakes her head no
you made the casting rounds together
ever get any movie work
so what about the film can
her eyes go to the floor tears begin to drop
a dirty movie
she nods her head silently
you have to tell us the whole thing sweetheart
so think it through
harry pours her a paper cup of water
she takes a sip
cadging at a bar in gardena
this mexican man raoul or jorge or something starting talking to me
i thought i was pregnant and i was desperate wicked bad for money
he said hed give me two hundred dollars to act in a nudie film
she takes a large gulp of water
linda martin contd he said he needed another girl so i asked betty
the three of us drove down to tijuana and we made the movie at this big house outside of town
beat then he drove us back to la
her head bowed
russ and harry stare at her impassively
was this around thanksgiving
she nods yes
bucky contd did the mex give betty a viewfinder
she raises her head in recognition and nods yes
bucky contd did he seem particularly interested in betty
did she see him again
she shakes her head no
bucky contd but you saw him again didnt you
how else could you have gotten a copy
linda looks sadly at bucky
after i read about betty
i went looking for him in gardena
he was about to go back to mexico and i conned him out of a print
where was that
i dont remember
on aviation somewhere
why would you do that
a black dahlia stag film
i could sell it if i had to
ashamed it was
a collectors item
and he willingly gave you a copy of the film
not for nothing
she looks down again
the cops look at each other
lindas harder and more desperate than they imagined
linda martin contd youll let me have it back wont you
you wont let people look at it
now its the cops turn to look away
russ and bucky
i think shes covering on the mex angle
maybe she knows him and doesnt want him taking a smut rap
maybe hes white
the tj stuff is sound though
id detach meg caulfield from wilshire clerical to play cellmate for a day
bleichert you are a very bright penny today
looks like its blue movie night at city hall
a projector and screen has been set up
all the big wigs are present ellis loew jack tierney thad green and chief of police c
millard harry and lee
a clerical assistant threads the projector as bucky settles into a seat next to lee
on lees lap is a newspaper with the headline boulevard citizens mastermind to be released la bound after years of custody raggedy gettin any
buckys about to respond when the lights dim and a blurred image hits the screen
it begins to focus
a title slave girls from hell the movie a big high ceiling room with egyptian hieroglyphics on the walls
pillars shaped like coiled serpents are stationed throughout the room the camera zooms in for a close up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each others tails
the snakes dissolve into betty short wearing only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance
an audible breath in the muster room
a hand reaches into frame passing betty a large cylindrical object a dildo scales covering the shaft fangs extending from the circumcised head
betty puts it in her mouth sucks it eyes wide open and glassy
an abrupt cut linda martin naked lying on a divan
betty enters the frame with the dildo she puts it between lindas legs pushing it inside her
linda rotates her hips trying her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness
another cut betty mouthing the words no please to the camera
a hand pushing her head down towards lindas crotch
betty tonguing next to the dildo
the atmosphere is somber but calm
the film continues
whattya think russ
this got anything to do with the girls murder long shot chief
harry and i are headed down to tj tonight
the mex doesnt play as the killer
but maybe he showed it to someone suddenly lee jumps up standing in front of the screen
who gives a fuck if he didnt kill her
ive sent boy scouts to the green room for less than this
he yanks down the screen with a crash and storms out of the room
the movie continues on the chalked up blackboard
lee sits on the ground head in his hands
bucky enters and sits on a bench next to him
did you see her face bucky
did you see
i did partner
bucky notices lees still clutching the de witt article in his fist
he pries it loose
ellis loew and russ millard enter

ellis turns on his heels
bucky sits in his cubicle searching the dahlia files
the clock behind him reads
youve been skating around all morning bleichert
vogel and koenig went to tijuana an hour ago so i need you to check out a radio car and get out there
and if you see that phantom partner of yours tell him this no shows gonna cost him three days pay

she runs her fingers down his ribcage teasing his boxing scars
sugar betty and i made love once that one time we met last summer

he jumps from the bed and pulls on his pants
bucky thats it i swear
please stay he pulls on his shirt his handcuffs and his
grabs his jacket madeleine contd stay sugar stay and slams the door on the way out
bucky steamed in the car
he flips on the police radio looking for distraction
instead he gets code four all units at crenshaw and stocker
two dead suspect dead raymond douglas nash warrant number raymond nash lies dead on the sidewalk
off to one side a short and wiry cop is describing for detectives how it all went down pantomiming how he shot an escaping raymond nash
bucky stands over nash staring at his dead features
he walks inside
buckys pov a robbery gone bad
a sixty year old korean shopowner lies dead behind the counter and his teenaged son lies dead in an aisle
blood and green linoleum
bucky bursts into the squad room seeing red
a cop walking through the bullpen points to the bathroom
bucky kicks in the door finding lee washing his hands in the sink
he holds his hands up to bucky blood oozes from lees knuckles
i beat up a wall
penance for nash
not good enough
bucky steps into lee with fists flying a mad demon
he smashes him again and again beating his only friend until lee slides senseless to the floor
bucky drinks bourbon straight his wrist heavily bandaged
losing the first bleichert blanchard fight got me local celebrity warrants and close to nine grand in cash winning the rematch got me a sprained wrist two dislocated knuckles and
the rest of the day off
whoever said winning isnt everything got that part right
bucky walks into the house and finds kay there
she holds up a newspaper the front page includes the black dahlia junior nash and bobby de witt
eyes red from crying were famous dwight
i havent seen him since you beat him up
bucky looks ashamed
kay contd i dont blame you
he walks to her and she holds him

he strokes her hair
bucky contd de witts probably in la by now

i dont want you coming over here just to sleep an the couch again
lee she holds up a hand waving him off
she knows all this

she knows him to the core
she steps back holding his hands
kay contd luck

buckys on the phone
thank you very much
he rings off looking very disturbed as russ and harry arrive
bucky contd what happened in tj
checked for the smut pad
peddlers double goose egg bucky
blanchards in tijuana
a border cop spotted him hobnobbing with a bunch of rough looking rurales last night
bucky exhales hard
russ millard contd what is it
re his phone call that was county parole
bobby dewitt bought a bus ticket at the santa rosa depot this morning
bucky cruises the tijuana streets child beggars dig for breakfast in trash cans taco venders stir pots of dog meat stew sailors and marines stumble out of whorehouses
rurales drive prewar chevys wearing black uniforms
back in la linda short let slip that her mex was actually a local named walter wellington who copped to making the film but quickly provided the cops his alibi
for the dahlias missing days
bucky parks at a big pink art deco hotel the divisidero
bucky badges the desk clerk and gets a room number
he heads upstairs
not that this stopped loew and his boys from rousting spics all over town for a possible dahlia frame up
the circus was becoming a farce
ellis loew fritz vogel and bill koenig arguing
we cant do that
wellington told tierney he made the pic bucky opens the door and the room falls quiet
ellis loew contd bleichert
lees down here and so is bobby de witt
bucky charges the da but vogel and koenig intercept him pushing him roughly back out in the hall
loew retreats to the other side of the room
you know what kid
i got a soft spot in my heart for light heavyweights
chucks his chin you promise not to hit billy and ill help you look for your partner
re buckys ragged appearance ill drive
you look like shit
bucky and fritz vogel drive past beggars swarming tourists hookers dispensing front seat blow jobs zoot suit youths prowling for drunks to roll
the two men park the car in the middle of a car choked street and decide to try walking
theyre immediately swallowed up by kid beggars shoving crucifixes in their faces
bucky tosses handfuls of coins into the gutters and the children scatter squabbling over the coins
fritz vogel approaches a rurale and talks to him
the rurale nods yes gesturing down an alley to a squat cinderblock building
vogel and bucky walk quickly down a corridor lined with empty cells
a mexican jailer unlocks the last cell and the two cops walk in to face the hatchet faced tough of now a grizzled and bloated well used piece of work
he stands up full of con bravado
well at least youre american
never thought il be glad to see you guys
why start now
vogel kicks in the balls dropping him to his knees
vogel smashes him with a thick backhand across the face
vogel stands over him
lee blanchards here in tj and you came here flush out of big q
thats a goddamned strange coincidence and i dont like it
i dont like you and i dont like being down in this rat infested country when i could be home with my family
dewitt pisses his pants
vogel contd did you know blanchard was in tj
aint seen blanchard since my fuckin trial
vogel smashes him across the face
do not use profanity with me and address me as sir
dewitts head bobs up and down
vogel contd now blanchards scared of you
man o manieschewitz what a laugh
lee beauty gotta be scared of me cause of how i flapped my trap at trial but all i know is what i read in the papers
maybe i was thinkin revenge maybe talkin trash to my cellies but when lee beauty killed them niggers vogel topples dewitt with a right hook and then picks him back
up by the neck squeezing the life out of him
bobby boy i do not like sergeant blanchard but he is a fellow officer and i will not have syphilitic scum like you defaming him
now you risked a parole violation for a trip down here
he lets go of his neck the color returning to dewitts face
vogel contd why are you here bobby
you tell me
a beaten dog i came down to cop some heroin and move it back to la
im meeting a guy felix casco at the gardena motel
dont hurt me no more
vogel claps his hands together gleeful with this bonus bust
heading out of the cell im gonna call ellis
bucky turns back to de witt whos much more relaxed now that vogels left the cell
finish up with you and blanchard
sir all thats between me and blanchard is that i fucked this cunt kay lake bucky leaps on de witt grabbing him around the neck and choking him
de witt turns blue his eyes bulging out and then hands on his shoulders as ducky is hurled backwards into the cell bars
and then which slowly becomes grey and then back to normal as bucky finds himself awakening on the floor of the cell
refocusing on the scene two rurales in jodhpur boots pick their teeth with matchsticks as fritz vogel pulls bucky to his feet
how long i let bobby boy go so we could tail him to his pal
but he blew his tail while you were catching up on your beauty sleep which is too bad for him
vogel koenig a rurale and bucky holding a piece of ice to the back of his head
the car arrives at a horseshoe shaped auto court
two mexican policeman stand guard outside one of its rooms
as the american cops walk in on a cordite reeking slaughterhouse
bobby de witt and a mexican man lay dead on the floor bullet holes oozing blood all over them
bucky notes the bruises on de witts neck from where he choked him
bucky squints at the men still a little disoriented
the spics felix casco a known dope trafficker
maybe it was other dope scum maybe lee maybe it was god
i say let our mexican colleagues handle their own dirty laundry and we go back to la and find the son of a bitch who sliced the dahlia
kay sits curled into a corner of the couch defensively
bucky sits on a small chair next to lees large easy chair
i spent the morning with internal affairs
i told them
everything i knew
i gave them so much
and in the end it didnt seem like anything at all
hell came back kay
im sure of it
you dont know anything dwight
but thats what i like about you
kay ive been offered a job
teaching sixth grade at fairfax primary
with lee gone now hes coming back
she nods mollifying him
as bucky jimmies the lock and pushes open the door
boxes of police falls scattered on the bed and desk
photos of elizabeth short pinned up all over the walls glamour glossies newspaper photos enlarged crime scene grotesquerie
the amount of manpower represented here is staggering so much work over one girl
bucky sits down at the desk and buries his head in his hands
interviewing a fortysomething talent agent in a slick suit
he sits at a desk with yellowed starlets headshots behind him
vogel leans on the desk intimidating the man
so i got her name from a producer friend of mine
met her in a bar
russ millard and harry sears stand goggle eyed as bucky shows them lees back up files
i wanted to believe it was all about lee
tracking lee through her
through the files he had collected
meticulously sifting through the material along with bucky
strangers recollections of a girls last days leading me to a partner
fritz vogel and bucky interviewing a hooker in a hotel lobby
the other girls and me we helped her out once in a while
throw her a trick if she needed dough
but she was no pro
where bucky watches kay grade papers a gulf between them
but the deeper into her i got the more i understood the detectives old saw any dick worth his suit always takes a side the perp or the vic
where bucky stands in the empty lot alone
most copsll tell ya
one day you wake up and youre in the head of the killer
youre the perp
as the camera dances across betty shorts naked body
we close in on her the mm film becoming finer and finer as the sex scene transforms into a live shot of betty short writhing in ecstasy underneath a man
she and the man fuck harder and harder faster and faster
groaning with the ecstasy of ejaculation but its not betty short
its madeleine sprague staring up at bucky as the two of them come simultaneously
as soon as its over she looks for his eyes
he wont look at her
she grabs his chin and turns him face to face
few copsll admit to walking the harder path
few will admit to waking up in the head of the vic
he lower his face to the pillow
another clapstick elizabeth short
screen test elizabeth short looking a bit more worn down holds a script up to her face
reading stiffly dont just walk out on me richard
say you care say you im sorry
theres a pause there
she stops frustrated
man contd maybe with a little more sadness
can you give me a little more sadness
the unsolved sheet at the lapd betting pool
handwritten on the sheet are the constantly dropping odds to replaced by to which has been replaced by even money
as of these officers currently assigned to the elizabeth short investigation will return to their regular duties
as bucky reads the list
unfortunately his name is not on it
he beelines straight to the quiet man looks up from his desk
i wasnt on the transfer list
i asked jack to keep you on
because youre getting to be a damn good detective bleichert
and harrys retiring in two years
need i spell it out
you been working this case pretty hard
or is it the other way around
bucky smiles weakly russ knows him
its not as much fun once it moves to the back pages is it
changing subjects i hear they arrested two mexicans in juarez for the bobby de witt murder
i heard that too
you must be relieved
theyve rescinded the apb on lee
if he doesnt show up in thirty days hes out
hell be found if he wants to be found
like the guy who killed the dahlia
russ smiles grimly
bucky rings the doorbell
fritz vogel answers
glad you could make it
he claps bucky on the shoulder and leads him into the house
the interior decorating equivalent of highballs and pretzels which is exactly what vogel bucky and ellis loew are consuming
bucky drinks with the trepidation of the kings food taster
i called this little meeting for a couple reasons bucky
wed both like to see the short case closed out and get back to normal business
bucky looks impatient and ellis senses this
ellis loew contd were both comers bucky
fritzie wants you for his partner when he gets his lieutenancy and russ millard wants me when harry retires
youre too raw for him boyo
old russ is a sob sister and im much more your type
bucky considers the truth in this
to loew what do you want ellis
very well dwight
ill tell you
there are four confessors still being held at city jail
theyve got no alibis werent coherent when they were first questioned and theyre all violent frothing at the mouth lunatics
i want them reintegrated
its a muscle job
i wanted bill koenig but bills a bit too enamored with violence
so its you dwight
yes or no
because if its yes ill make sure youre back on warrants tomorrow with an inside track to some stripes
if not its homicide shitwork until russ millard gets tired of you
we both know that russ is a patient forbearing man dwight
that could be a long time
yes or no
as four manacled men are being loaded into a drunk wagon while bucky flips through their rap sheets and mug shots
the four men sit in the back as bucky drives the truck
the camera pans their faces
the first loren bidwell pale old and palsied
on my way over i played out their rap sheets in my head trying to work up a head of hate
loren bidwell three time atascadero loser falls for aggravated sexual assault on minors
between prison jolts he confessed to all the big sex crimes
bucky pulls the drunk wagon up to a building its street facade illuminated kounty king lunch meat serving l
the camera finds the second man cecil durkin
voice over contd cecil durkin hophead knife fighter and a jailhouse rape o who played jazz drums with some good combos
he took two quentin jolts for arson and was caught masturbating at the scene of his last torch
fritz vogel opens the door and leads the men inside
a huge sawdust covered roam meathooks dangling from the ceiling
beef dangles over half the hooks
the four men look terrified
the camera finds the third man charlie issler charlie issler was a pimp and a career confessor specializing in copping to hooker homicides
his three procuring beefs had netted him a year county jail time his phony confessions two ninety day observation stints at the camarillo nut farm
and the fourth man paul orchard voice over contd and finally paul orchard
jack roller male prostitute and a former san bernardino county deputy sheriff
the group reaches a back wall of the warehouse where four bucky studies the mens apprehensive faces as vogel stands each one on a chair with their manacled hands hooked
over their respective meathooks
buckys gaze drifts back behind a large box where he sees a sheet covered table sticking out
before his curiosity draws him over vogel addresses the prisoners
you all confessed to killing the dahlia
we cant prove you did so youre gonna have to convince us
query on bucko
bucky takes a deep breath and heads first to old man bidwell
the mans palsy has him shaking and bucky grabs the meathook above him to steady him
tell me about betty short pops
whyd you kill her
bidwell looks at him with beseeching eyes
dont be timid boyo
that bird made little boys suck his hog
buckys hand twitches on the meathook
come clean pop
i didnt kill her mister
i just wanted a ticket to the honor farm
three hots and a cot thats all
the mans weakened state makes his argument for him
bucky moves on to cecil durkin
tell me about it cecil
laughing you get that line from dick tracy or gangbusters
bucky catches vogel out of the corner of his eye
one more time shitbird
tell me about you and betty short
i fucked betty short and i fucked your mama
im your fucking daddy
bucky one twos him in the solar plexus
his legs buckle but he keeps his feet on the chair
durkin contd you think you clever dont you
you the bad guy your buddy the nice guy
older than vaudeville
im the nice guy cecil
keep that in mind
this shuts durkin up
bucky moves to charlie issler
i didnt kill liz
i dont know why i do these things and i apologize
so please dont let that man hurt me
i just cant
youre a pimp
you know betty short
whyd you confess to her murder
she looked so
sweet and pretty and i felt so bad
i always confess to the pretty ones
you feel guilty charlie
you hit your girls get em high on hop
i do such nasty things i dont know why vogel struts over putting on brass knuckles
this kid glove routines gettin old he kicks isslers chair out from under him the pimp screaming as his wrists snap
vogel kicks the remaining three chairs out punctuating each with a declaration vogel contd jack roller
the men scream like dying animals as fritzie zeroes in on charlie issler
he begins punching him in the gut with the brass knuckles
vogel contd tell me about the dahlias missing days you whoremonger
tell me what you know
he punches him in the crotch
i knew you at ad vice
vogel ignores him rabbit punching him cracking one rib and then another knowing this is getting out of control
hes mesmerized by a fire alarm on the wall behind the men
tell me what your girls tell you
issler retches coughing up blood
bucky stares at the fire alarm as fritz runs through his field of vision cackling
bucky refocuses on the scene as fritzie returns wheeling the sheet covered table buckyd seen before
he whips off the sheet revealing vogel grabs issler by the scruff of the neck and jerks him down off of the meathook
vogel contd for your cutting pleasure jane doe number forty three
youre all going to slice her and the best slicer buys the ticket
issler bites through his lip as fritzie pulls out a switchblade and pops it open
bucky takes in the nightmare scene all in slow motion the men with their broken wrists the pudgy naked corpse fritzie with the knife
he runs for the fire alarm and pulls the lever a piercing bell ringing out as bucky runs out of the warehouse and jumps into the drunk wagon tearing off
into the night
kay answers the door and finds bucky sitting on the front porch sobbing
she moves to him touching him on the back of the neck the stroke of her finger enough to make him stand and face her
bucky tries to talk but she puts fingers to his mouth
mouth to his fingers
she undresses him
slowly she touches him easing him bringing him back to earth back to humanity
and finally they are joined
another typewritten sheet lapd transfer orders officer dwight bleichert
from central warrants
to foot patrol swingwatch
bucky picks his way through passed out drunks and bums
hes back in uniform
east th street from main to stanford
blood banks liquor stores selling half pints and short dogs exclusively fifty cent a night flophouses and derelict missions
two officers brutally herd winos into a drunk wagon
bucky turns and walks the other direction refusing to help
they see him and sneer
banished by ellis loew who dared me to try my word against a twenty two year man and the citys future district attorney
i confined the truth to russ and kay and determined to spend my shifts trying to be the worst foot hack in history
he hands a quarter to a drunk as he passes urging him with his nightstick to crawl back into a bar
russ millard pores over a file in their private collection
bucky sits with his feet up on the bed flipping through a folder
a month passed
the dahlia leads dwindled to zero and every officer except russ and harry were returned to their regular assignments
as for me id been able to contain my dahlia interests within the walls of the el nido
bucky eyes a dahlia photo pinned to the wall
voice over contd still i remembered what madeleine said when i told her we were through
madeleine sits on the bed fully dressed
bucky stands in the doorway
youll be back
beat i look like her
bucky turns and leaves as we where kay and bucky sleep in bed locked as spoons
but sometimes betty came to me
bucky watches fritz vogel beats the hell out of charles issler as he hangs off the meathook
in the background betty short stands and screams bucky
crying ill do whatever you want
ill be okay
bucky turns and stares at her
what is it
as bucky stares across the room at a picture of the dahlia
millard sits at the small desk waiting for him to come back
bucky finally sees russ again
you ever hear anyone refer to betty as liz
anyone at all
i thought he said hed never heard of her
you know what else he said
as vogel cracks isslers ribs
what did you know about the dahlias missing days
i knew you at ad vice harry sears cradles the phone in his ear as he flips through a large metal file cabinet
behind him the glass door reads in reverse administrative vice
n n no russ
no file on issler
bucky and russ sit in silence thinking
they know theyre onto something
fritzie didnt give a damn about those other three
it was all about issler
never occurred to me before
bucky gets to his feet
bucky contd meet me back here
bright penny but buckys already out the door
bucky stakes out the dark house
bucky slips an oil dipstick into the narrow crack of the back door and flips the simple hook and eyehole lock
he slides into the house
as bucky creeps through the house until he gets to a closed door
he opens it entering he stumbles along the wall until he finds a standing gooseneck lamp and turns it on
the walls are covered with pictures of fritzie in uniform dating back twenty five years
bucky bends down in front of the small mahogany desk and begins rifling through its file drawers
what he finds surprises him carbons of official lapd intelligence reports lists of account balances financial dealings payments made all cross referenced to each individual being investigated
a veritable how to primer on how to extort from criminals
bucky digs deeper into the files and pulls out isslers ad vice file complete with mug shots
bucky scans the file running his finger down the list of names looking for something familiar
he stops at one sally stinson
beside her name a handwritten note biltmore hotel
he writes it down and moves to another list of names known associates no prostitution record
and there it is betty short
bucky bops to jazz on his radio pumped with adrenaline
bucky tears through a file as russ watches
so good ol fritzies shaking down crooks maybe sellin em tip offs before a roust
i want him nailed
theyd have to testify against him first
and thats not likely after he burns those carbons
but this issler business why hide the issler betty connection
finding a file maybe charlie pimped her out
to somebody fritzie doesnt want us to know about
as fritz beats on charlie tell me what you know about the dahlias missing days bucky reads through a letter
i knew it
betty writes to one of her phantom servicemen boyfriends reading aloud
had drinks with a great girl sally stinson who thinks she way be able to help me get a job cocktailing
yeah i know
thats what made it stick with me
what next padre
you sit tight
go hack to swingwatch
me and harryll poke around
displeased i want him
youll get him too
but youve got to cool your temper
its all patience with the big fish or they wriggle off
bucky lies awake while kay sleeps
what kept me up that night wasnt the idea of fritz vogel extorting criminals or fritz vogel bracing charlie the pimp to see if betty had told him something about
one of her johns
maybe even vogel himself
ellis loew fritz vogel and bucky drink cocktails and eat pretzels
what kept me up was this thought if issler blabbed about liz and her tricks i would have overheard
fritz was confident he could keep me quiet
ellis and fritz clink glasses
smile at bucky
voice over contd and that was an underestimation i would bleed him for
her hand brushes against his cheek
he reaches for it
weve found her
meet me at north havenhurst in half an hour
as bucky hangs up the phone
trying to look casual he sidles over to a desk with fritz vogel on the name plate and snags a photo of fritz and johnny off the desk
a worn woman in her early thirties sally stinson sits on a stack of luggage russ and bucky in chairs
she wears a cheap kimono and too much makeup for the middle of the day
she holds the photo of the vogels
shakes out her hair and closes her kimono a little
i do a lot a cops you know
comes with the territory
charlie used to say it was my union dues
keep my operators license
she laughs a little trying to loosen herself up
please get to it
it was a full day job
c note and a half
kept talkin about givin me the big schnitzel
more like a cocktail frank once we got down to it
well we screw the whole afternoon
go down to the lobby for some dinner and theres liz sittin by herself
youd hooked with her before
three or four times
and lemme tell you something im pretty good at faking it
but liz she was good
a virtuoso academy award kind of stuff she do dyke
nothing like that
but i bet shed be gooood
sally contd anyway we all get to talking
schnitzel takes a liking to her and liz tells me she needs the dough
so i set up a trick within a trick
i take a breather and they go at it in the bedroom
a couple hours later liz left
did anything unusual happen
i think it got a little kinky
hed brought a couple toys
he may have
whipped her a bit
russ and bucky glance at each other remembering lashmarks at the autopsy
did vogel say anything about liz
was he gonna see her again
she liked the big schnitzel
anything else miss stinson
her face clouds over
liz got in all the papers
she has a hard time going on
helping her out is this when your pimp charlie confesses
composing herself yeah
anyways fritzie v
shows up and shakes me hard about charlie whether hed say anything about liz to the caps
beat me bad
she lifts her head
taps her nails on the suitcases underneath her
one last time to be sure
pointing to fritzies picture you are sure this is the man that you tricked with
and tricked with liz short
a puzzled look covers her face
no mister you got it all wrong
but you said fritz just beat me
it was sonny me and liz did
she taps her finger on john vogels face
sally contd id recognize that lousy fuck anywhere
off bucky and russ shock we as they cruise the streets of skid row
while russ talks bucky fills a hypodermic needle with an amber liquid
ill be a chimps priest buck
a chimps priest watch the air bubbles i shoulda known that johnny i d need a pro to lose his cherry
never had em for a kink and a cherry though
bucky points out the window
johnny vogel wrestles with two drunks kicking at them as they scamper into some trash
exiting the car johnny johnny ambles over to bucky
whatcha doin in civvies bleichert
bucky drills him in the solar plexus doubling him over
he grabs vogel by the hair and slams his head into the roof of the car as johnnys lights dim
as russ millard injects the needle into johnnys arm
johnny vogel handcuffed to a radiator his head bobbing back and forth
his eyes trying to focus on russ and bucky
pentothals good for another couple hours
no way he can lie
johnnys eyes drift to the pictures on the walls
elizabeth short shitbird
elizabeth fucking short
russ touches buckys arm urging him to sit back
theres a method to this bucky
focusing on johnny whats your name son
slurring you know me loot
answer me anyway
vogel john g
whats sixteen and fifty two
whyd you hit me bleichert
i didnt do you no dirt
focus on january johnny
your father friedrich vogel
he wanted you to lose your cherry
he bought you a woman for two days

not a woman
not a real one
johnny turns the syllable into a long laugh
this was at the biltmore
daddy got a good rate on the room
he knew the house dick
this aint right
well be done soon johnny
you met liz short at the biltmore too
whats her name introduced me
and what did you and liz do
played horse and rider

johnny thinks back his head lolling to and fro
so so softly
horse and rider
did you kill liz short
johnny jerks back spasmodically
no no no no
i didnt kill her
easy son i didnt slice her
its all right
do you know who did
johnnys starting to sweat
russ and bucky lean in
when your daddy found out youd been with her he tried to fix things didnt he
johnny nods yes
russ millard contd he found out charlie issler had been picked up and he knew charlie had this confessing problem right
went to ellis
to the jewboy
wanted to get charlie released
but the jewboy said no
daddy had a morgue friend owed him a favor and got this doa cooze
daddy wanted uncle bill but ellis jewboy said take bleichert
looking right at bucky daddy said youd do it cuz without blanchard you were jelly
said you were a sob sister weak sister
johnny starts laughing hysterically shaking his chained hands like a zoo animal trying to get loose
russ steps in front of a red hot bucky to bucky i think you should go outside
bucky sits out on the fire escape watching cars drive by
russ leans out the window and hands bucky the statement
bucky reads it and slips it into his pocket
we should sit on this for a little bit
until i can talk to a legal officer
bucky shakes his head no climbs back inside the window
bucky handcuffs johnnys hands behind his back as the big man cries
to bucky its the shithouse until you retire you know that
i owe her this one
he squeezes johnnys handcuffs tighter
reporters follow bucky and johnny inside piqued by the sight of a plainclothes officer escorting a cuffed uniform inside
whispering in johnnys ear tell your daddy i know everything
including his extortion deal
tell him im goin to the papers tomorrow
he approaches the desk sergeant
what the hell is this
a flashbulb goes off in their faces
im officer dwight bleichert and this is officer john vogel
he hands over johnnys signed statement
bucky contd book him
bucky jogs up the steps inside
he dresses in his blue uniform preparing to go back to work
officer bleichert go to the watch commanders office immediately
bucky brushes imaginary dust off his shirt and grabs his hat
bucky walks in saluting like an idealistic rookie
jastrow stands ignoring the salute
youre on two weeks vacation leave as of now
when you return to duty report to chief green
hell reassign you to another division
fritz vogel just blew his brains out
all bucky can think to do is salute again rock firm
he walks outside and crosses into crammed with blues awaiting roll call
they all stare at bucky he meets the eyes that seek his making them look down
as he passes he can hear the hisses traitor
he continues towards the door almost out when suddenly he hears applause
bucky turns to see russ millard harry sears and thad green clapping good bye
clapstick elizabeth short screen test she sits on an ugly brown sofa sides in her hands
are you all right miss short
she looks up seeing the camera as if for the first time
man contd why dont you just
what do you mean
put the sides down
talk to me
what would you like to talk about
i dont know
do you have a boyfriend
kay and bucky sit on a bench looking out at the water
i could take sick days
maybe a trip to santa barbara or even a drive to san francisco
you dont owe him a thing bucky
i know you wont believe me
but youve more than repaid him already
he looks at her and she knows its useless
kay contd when
she takes his hand
youre a fool dwight
as bucky crosses the border into mexico
i closed out my glory days the only way i knew how i chased the gone man
bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals flashing both his badge and snapshots of lee
as bucky tries to shake them pulling out his pockets to show them he has no more coins
graduating from small change to one dollar bills
same of them seem to have stories to tell
i got headshakes bullshit broadsides and a strange series of tales that rang true
one had el blanco explosivo beating the shit out of three jack rollers then buying off the cops with double saws peeled from a large roll
another had lee donating scoots to a leper ministry priest and then driving to ensenada
as bucky drives south passing a sign which says ensenada he passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the road
they carry suitcases and head north
bucky approaches ensenada
the trickle of families headed north has now becoming a roadside migration march
every fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern
bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown hes ever seen rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the northbound migration line taking money and attaching
tags to their shoulders with staple guns plainclothes cops sell bags of beef jerky and dried fruit putting coins into dispensers attached to their belts
two rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless with the butts of their sawed off shotguns
i decided it would be wise to check in with the law before going out to question the ensenada citizenry
bucky stands outside a converted church with the word policia painted in black over religious scenes
velvet wall hangings depicting jesus decorate the entrance hall
blackshirts lounge on converted pews a huge carved cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins
bucky slides the rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar
the man saunters off down the hall
as bucky is escorted in
the man sitting behind the desk looks up
in flawless english officer bleichert
come in please
im captain vasquez
how can i help you
bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of lee
this mans lapd
hes been missing in mexico since january
he was last seen headed here
vasquez studies the photo
bucky senses a twitch
im afraid not
ill ask my men however
staying the night
are you here alone
i have two partners waiting for me in tijuana
vasquez nods hard to know if he believes bucky any more than bucky believes him
bucky contd if you dont mind ill check back in the morning
bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and wipes his brow off
he kicks his travel bag underneath the bed and heads out
as bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit glues them to the door jamb
garish neon military personnel
brownshirts packing serious weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order
his pov an adobe streetfront with a neon sign club boxeo
bucky goes inside
bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half dressed mexican strippers
he stands on his tip toes trying to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of proprietor
cn a far wall boxing publicity stills
he wanders over
a row of light heavies gus lesnevich billy conn and bucky
three stills over next to joe louis is lees photo
they all look so young
an old voice in english breaks his reverie bleichert
first blanchard then you
bucky wheels and finds himself face to face with an old man
youve seen him
couple months ago
heavy rains in february
musta talked fights for ten hours straight
you know blanchard thinks the feathers are the best division
me its the middies for sure
la motta graziano is he still in town
dont think so
i own this place
he aint been back
you lookin for a rematch
im looking to get him out of a shitload of trouble
the old pug looks him up and down
ill tell ya the little i know
heard he caused a ruckus over at the club satan had to bribe his way out big with captain vasquez
talk to ernie the cook
tell him i said to be kosher with you
you aint been in there
bucky walks into the biggest sewer you have ever seen
the bar is a urinal trough where marines and sailors masturbate while going down on nude women squatting on the bartop
blow jobs are being dispensed underneath tables facing the bandstand
up on the stage a man in a satan costume is fucking a woman on a mattress
next to him a donkey with red velvet horns pinned to his head eats hay out of a bowl while drunken servicemen shout donkey
bucky is accosted by a disgusting old woman
you wan the bar handsome
breakfast of champions one dollar
round the world two dollars
i need to see ernie
and grabs him by the arm
ernie a half mexican half chinese man stands next to a huge vat of stew
bucky flashes lees photo
i heard this man gave you some trouble a while back
who wants to know
bucky flashes his badge giving him a glimpse of his gun
you his friend
hes my best friend
the chef tucks his hands into his aprons fidgeting
your friend drink fourteen shots of my best mescal a house record
that i like
he make toasts to dead women
that i dont mind
but he try to fuck with my donkey show and that i dont take
four of my guys he take the fifth he dont
rurales take him home to sleep it off
ernie casually pulls a switchblade out of his apron and scratches the back of his neck with it
bucky walks outside and begins weaving his way back through the crowds
out of the corner of his eye he catches a couple rurales who seem to have taken an interest in him
he dodges down an alley and cuts down another street breaking into a slow jog
bucky walks backwards checking the crowd
hes lost them
bucky stands in front of his door
he runs his finger up and down the door jamb
the hairs are gone
with one swift kick he breaks down the door
a white man stands with his hands raised
im a friend bucky gestures with his gun for the man to hit the wall
he frisks him pulling out a wallet and tossing on the bed
man contd milton dolphine citizen of san diego and a licensed private dick
i got seventy bucks in there but that moneys jackshit compared to what blanchard was holding
you go partners with me and its easy street bucky kicks the mans legs out and pushes his to the floor
you tell me all of it and you watch what you say about my partner or its a b e roust and the ensenada jail
dolphine pulls himself up
you mean vasquez
how do you think i knew to follow you
hes got a vested interest in you not finding out about blanchard
bucky eyes the door
does he know im staying here
bucky steps back from dolphine
lets hear it
about a month ago this mexican woman shows up at my office in dago
chubby ten tons a makeup but dressed to the nines
offers me five hundred to find blanchard
just like you i track him here where hes playing the rich gringo i even see him beat up two spics who insult this senorita rurales stand by and do
so i know hes paying protection dough
a lot of it
then i hear he paid off two plainclothes rurale to snuff a coupla guys in tj i leave a message in dago for the woman tellin her what i know
whats her name
but it was obviously a phony
casco ran with some rich bimbos and im betting shes one of his
revenge on blanchard for offin felix
bucky tightens his grip on the slats of a wooden chair
this is hitting him hard
i come back to ensenada on my own thinking about all that cash he was flashing
buckys jaw clenches
dolphine contd you wanna hear this
bullet in the cabeza
beat rumor is they never found any money
buckys head begins to reel
dolphine contd maybe the rurales
maybe that woman or friends of hers
i figured blanchard was rogue figured someone like youd come lookin for him
maybe have a line on where the cash was
you knew blanchard maybe we can bucky backhands dolphine hard knocking him off the chair
dolphine contd look i didnt know it was personal
dont hit me again bucky has his gun out leveled at dolphine
prove it to me
dolphine drives his car while bucky trains his gun on him
they come over a ridge and find themselves on a big bluff overlooking the ocean
a huge wooden burning cross marks the spot
the locals keep the damn thing lit up
they got a lotta missing relatives
you got a shovel
gardening tools good enough
bucky scavenges a spare piece of picket fence wraps it in a rag and lights a torch off of the cross
dolphine kicks at a filthy american flag in the sand
supposed to be near el bannero
as dolphine digs at gun point
after a few strokes the crunch of the shovel hitting bone
bucky terrified to look but has to know a white jumper sailors uniform
its a sailor
bucky breathes out hard
dolphine digs on pushing the corpse out of the way and digging further into he sand
bucky cant stand the suspense
he tucks his gun into his waistband and grabs the shovel
after a few more strokes the thump of something solid
and suddenly its there sunburned pink skin blond hair and stitch scars on the eyebrows
and buckys in dolphines truck while dolphines screaming for him to wait and bucky slams the truck in reverse knocking the burning cross to the ground and grinding out out
of the sand onto the road heading north and leaving dolphine and lee alone at the grave
heading north like a refugee
buckys car rolls up slowly as he kills the engine trying not to make any noise
the sun comes up illuminating buckys filthy face as he watches the picture perfect house wishing time would stand still
or better yet wishing it would go back
finally he gets out of the car and begins a long walk into the house
but as the camera pulls back we see bucky in his dress blues standing next to kay in a wedding dress
russ millard and harry sears stand by as the only two guests
lee and kay had lived in sin not because their shack job was against department regs but because the ghosts of their past had forced them to choose between love
and passion the veneer of a fairy tale only a band aid for a fractured life
as harry and russ drink from a punch bowl
our true vows were made in private bury the past bury our ghosts and as kay said bury that fucking girl
another lapd transfer form officer dwight bleichert
reassigned to scientific investigation detail bucky with plastic gloves on typing blood with an eye dropper and a test tube
meticulous and boring
news radio plays in the background
a detective pokes his head in bleichert
you got those prints for me
bucky pulls a file out of a stack and gives it to him
the nonchalance of a man whose job has become routine
detective contd thanks
we gotta hot one i think
bucky smiles politely and returns to his desk
the radio results in the republican primary are final
john dougdale trouncing d
ellis loew to
in county primaries
this gets a smile from bucky as he returns to his test tubes and beakers
detectives comb through a murder scene as bucky collects latent fingerprints off doorknobs
no one pays him any attention
hes been relegated to the worst kind of purgatory
bucky and kay drink coffee and read the morning paper
she absently strokes his free hand
bucky intently reads the front page
the headline reads city council investigates s boom underneath a picture of sprague and mack sennett posing in front of the hollywoodland sign
hes startled by kay tapping her finger on the photo
that reminds me of something dwight
bucky tries to hide his panic
floorboards loose near the closet
think you could fix it
relieved sure babe
the phone rings
bucky answers it
bucky contd hello
bucky writes something on a piece of paper
bucky contd gotta go
work up on a probable gunshot suicide
where is it
bucky rings the bell
hes dressed plainclothes and carries a technicians canvas bag
an attractive woman in her early fifties opens the door
im officer bleichert
my i express my condolences mrs
youre the lab man
he nods yes
she lets him in and he follows
its the study in back of the dining room
youll see the police rope
if youll excuse me ill be in my garden
he notices for the first time shes dressed for gardening
bucky steps over the police rope and into the study
a large desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to a tape outline of a body
three feet away lies a shotgun
behind the chair the brown spattering of blood and brains decorates the white wall and crown mouldings
as bucky measures the splatter marks on the walls scrapes tissue from the muzzle of the gun dusts it for latent prints etc
at the end he wraps the gun in a plastic bag
as bucky steps over the police rope and walks back towards the main foyer
he stops short
hangs a disturbing painting the portrait of a clown a young boy done up in court jesters garb
his body is gnarled and hunched
he wears a stuporous ear to ear smile that looks like one continuous deep scar
it is eerily reminiscent of elizabeth shorts death wound
spooked bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby family photos two young women linked arm in arm
the other survivors
pretty arent they
she arrives next to him dusty with soil
like their mother
how old are they
twenty one and twenty three
are you finished in the study
tell whoever cleans it up to use pure ammonia
looking at the two girls mrs
jane do you know madeleine and martha sprague
the next block over
snorts those girls and that family
how do you know them
i did a little work for them once
consider it lucky if it was a brief encounter
how do you mean
the hallway phone rings
jane moves to answer it
back to condolences
thank you for being so nice mr
good bye jane
bucky writes up a report
vic pokes his head in
you finish working up the suicide bucky
whattya know about the husband
widow said he was depressed failing health
the terrible burden of all that moneyll get you every time
wonder how he made it
no mystery there
the garage door is open to the evening air
buckys heavy bag and speed bag hang on hooks
bucky leans against a stool a large box open on the work bench
bucky brushes aside a clutter of junk and pulls out a photo album
he opens it and begins flipping through articles and photos concerning elizabeth short
its like a man in a mid life crisis fantasizing about his high school sweetheart
screen test she rambles on almost oblivious of the camera
i had a fiance captain matt durand
he was in a tank battalion
the fiercest blue eyes
like the deep water you see from a fishing boat
shes lost in thought
were not sure whether this is a scene her real life or just a sad lie
bucky drops the album back in the box as kays car pulls into the driveway
he covers it back up
getting out whatre you doing
looking for the hammer
she points over his shoulder to the hammer hanging in plain view
bucky kneels on the ground near the closet toolbox next to him
he pulls on the floorboard it flexes and squeaks
he uses the hammer to pull the board completely off
he squeezes wood glue around the edges and is about to replace the board when something under the floor catches his eye
he reaches into the hole pulling out stacks of hundred he spies another scrap of paper in the hole
kay pours two scotches
she carries the scotches into the bedroom and finds dwight sitting on the floor staring at thousands of dollars in cash
he holds a paper money band inscribed
boulevard citizens bank
kay contd oh
always wondered where he kept it
a shotgun blast shatters the back window of the armored truck
in the front seat lee blanchard ducks down as the driver hits the gas
as bucky leans back against the bed
were you ever going to tell me
hed given all his money to ben siegel
beat he wanted to give me a home
lee and bucky their first day as partners
said id get a shot at joe louis if id take two dives for him
i said no
as bucky looks straight up into the ceiling light
were you ever going to tell me
he knew what bobby was doing to me
how hed used a razor on me
pimped me to his friends
as lee plants the incriminating bank bags in dewitts closet
bucky staring back into the hole in the floor
bobby know nothing about the bank job
he and lee they never even met
after lee and his driver got away lee figured framing bobbyd give me a way out
lee leads kay out of the courtroom
as kay leans down next to bucky gently putting her hand on his shoulder
then last year
the fourth man the driver he heard bobby was getting paroled
he threatened to tell dewitt that lee framed him
he wanted money we didnt have
ten thousand dollars
were you ever
promise me this forgive him for dewitt
forgive him for the bank
it doesnt matter anymore
not to us
who was the driver kay
hes in her face now
okay pal you asked for it
three black man and a white man get rousted by lee and bucky
chaos erupts as lee executes baxter fitch and bucky kills two others
on buckys anguished face kay contd he used you dwight
forgive him everything else
but dont forgive him for that
she reaches for his face and he pulls away
as the crumpled money drops down into the hole in the floor into the blackness
bucky stripped to bare chest attacks the heavy beg
fire and ice
the hero and the snitch
bank robber and his best friend the bumfuck detective
weak point in a fairy tale triangle
he lashes into the heavy bag with a series of brutal left hooks
kay stands in the door watching him
her eyes red from crying
voice over contd i would forgive lee the bank job
and i thought id forgive kay her role in keeping it from me
but the basic rule of homicide applied nothing stays buried forever
nothing stays buried forever
kay turns around and shuts the door behind her
bucky and jane drink iced tea
a glorious garden behind them
what brings you around again
considering a courtin the old rich widow
youre not that old
and youre not very widowed
you either are or you arent
you seem to be doing all right
eldridge had cancer
i half expected it
we werent that close anymore
little over a year
nothing better is there
buckys face betrays his difficulties
jane chambers contd sorry
so how well do you know the spragues
eldridge and emmett went way back
they served on the california real estate board together
but emmett was a bit of a crook
my husband got him kicked off the board for building dangerous buildings under phony corporations
your husband sounds like a good man
he had his moments
most of it was out of guilt
he owned slum blocks in san pedro
when he learned he had cancer he really started feeling guilty
he voted democratic last year
even went in and had meetings with the city council
im sure he gave them dirt on emmett
i read an article in the paper
same day eldridge killed himself
apropos i guess
maybe your husband my husband was rich and did a mean charleston
i loved him until i found out he was cheating on me
now im starting to love him again
its not so strange
they watch each other enjoying each others company
a strange emotional peace
youre very accepting of other peoples frailties
you should have illusions
im a cop
illusions arent standard issue
so howd a cop get mixed up with madeleine sprague
it was madeleine i assume
buckys gut clenches
i stopped her at a red light
one thing led to another
why do you assume it was madeleine
dont play dumb bucky
the girls a roundheels
always has been
dont be catty
she cant help it im sure
she probably inherited it from her mother
before bucky can press jane stands up with the tray of iced tea
the visit is over
you figure out the rest officer
he follows her back inside
as they stop momentarily in front of the scary clown painting
god that is spooky
eldridge bought it for my birthday a couple years ago
i hate it
want to take it with you
thank you then
you were my best condoler
and you mine
jane gives bucky a warm handshake
bucky pulls out of june street and passes muirfield
he slows for a moment squinting down the street trying to discern the sprague mansion
he drives on
we hang on the sign for muirfield avenue as the day turns to night
and down muirfield road we see buckys car parked in the shadows
watching the sprague house
bucky sleeps soundly as kay readies herself for work
she watches him for a moment considering whether to wake him
she decides not to and leaves
the minute she goes bucky opens his eyes
bucky spies on the spragues
he digs back into his seat as madeleine comes down the walk and puts mail in the mail box
just for a second it looks like she sees him
bucky dozes his tie almost catching on fire in a bunsen burner
bucky leans against the window propping himself up
madeleines packard pulls out and roars up the street
bucky guns his car to follow
bucky follows the packard into a crowded gi bar parking lot
he parks a distance away
but as he watches madeleine get out of her car he is staggered its elizabeth short
or more accurately its madeleine dressed up exactly like the dahlia in one of her famous portrait photos
slinky black dress upswept hair down to the yellow barrette
she strides into the bar
bucky ducks into a smoke filled gi bar where a commotion is already taking place
madeleine is surrounded by soldiers fawning all over her
other men simply point and whisper her dahlia act isnt lost on anybody
bucky slides into a booth in the corner to watch
he signals for a drink
four bourbons later
bucky watches as madeleine settles into a more intimate conversation with one soldier
bucky downs his drink as madeleine grabs the gis elbow and escorts him out of the bar
bucky sits in his car in the parking lot watching the soldier loiter outside of a motel room
madeleine returns from the office with the key and lets the two of them in
he watches as the light goes on and then off
bucky comes into the bedroom to find kay waiting up for him
dwight he moves to her pulling off his clothes as quickly as he can
kay contd dwight hes on top of her his bourbon stained kisses go and down her neck and her breasts
she responds but not quickly enough for him
he rushes into her before shes ready
still she tries to be there for him hoping to catch up with his lust
and they both know it
they embrace trying to cover up the hollow awkwardness with familiar affection
it doesnt work
bucky sits at thad greens desk penitent
sids not a bad beat bucky
at the time it was better than you deserved
thad green contd the blues hate you bucky
vogel was their pal
i do this for you you better be fucking supercop
bucky just sits silent
another lapd transfer order transfer order
to newton street division nightwatch
bucky back in uniform again
this time the black slums
heroin hookers hard core dealers gangs
newton street division
footbeat hacks carried metal studded saps squadroom dicks packed
automatics loaded with unregulation dum dums
bucky and a large black man come tumbling out of the liquor store throwing vicious punches at each other
bucky takes three to land six eventually knocking the guy out
he looks across the street to see to cops watching him measuring him
as bucky chases two men towards a chain link fence at the end of the alley
one of them gets to the fence and scrambles up it
bucky yanks the other one off the fence slamming him to the ground
for one month i escaped them all
as kay sleeps alone in the bed
a fucking supercop
bucky sits in his uniform listening to a jazz quartet
bucky sleeps on the couch as kay leaves for work
i escaped them all
bucky in his patrol car
the night a hot sweat
he listens to music on his radio and watches two hookers dance on the corner waving at cars
a scraggly old wino staggers up to the women stumbling around them dancing with them
they sneer at him tell him to beat it
bucky flashes his headlights at the bum
the bum ignores him
bucky flashes them again annoyed
the bum looks into the glare and flips bucky off
and suddenly bucky snaps jumping from his car
in three big strides hes on the bum clobbering him with roundhouse lefts and rights
the women are screaming
the drunk is screaming
bucky drops him staggering into a phone booth
he drops a nickel in the phone
dials a number
he hangs up
a womans voice answers
buckys just onto the porch steps when madeleine answers the door
shes dressed like the dahlia
he pushes her inside
it was a reunion of avowed tramps old rutters who knew theyd never have it as good with anyone else
afterwards wed talk through the night
crazy papa bleichert
sixth graders write in silence
kay sits at her desk sadness in her eyes as she watches the children
mostly though wed talk about betty
her utter malleability a chameleon eager to please anybody
and the disrupter of every life close to me
it would last a month
bucky stands in the living room examining family photos
a photo of two young proud wwi vets george tilden and emmett sprague
a photo of the dark haired ramona and the ruddy and fair haired emmett
photos of madeleine and martha the brunette and the ruddy blond
back to the first photo george tildens dark hair
madeleine wanders in bucky smiles at her
she runs her hands over his shoulders
bucky contd i thought the family came back from laguna this week
her scottish brogue you miss em laddie
your fathers georgie tilden war stories
he scans her for a reaction
if she has one it ripples through her almost undetectable
as bucky cruises by grinning
he salutes the house
in the scheme of things it wasnt much
rich old lady gossip as jane put it
as he drives onto his own modest street
voice over contd but combine it with banging madeleine in all twenty two rooms of their mansion it was good enough for me
a moving van in the driveway and kays plymouth stuffed with boxes
bucky double parks and bolts up the steps
the van pulls away behind him
to the van driver hey
get back here
the van driver ignores him bucky turns as kay walks out onto the porch
i didnt touch your things
you can have the furniture
babe did you think id let my husband disappear for three weeks and do nothing about it
ive had detectives following you dwight
she looks like that fucking dead girl so you can have her not me
he reaches for her and she backs out of grabbing range
she spins out of his grasp and makes for her car
she guns the engine and disappears
bucky stands in the middle of the living room cataloguing the little things
no periodicals on the coffee table half the record collection gone no candlesticks
he picks up the largest chair lees favorite and throws it at the wall
next kays rocking chair shatters the glass cabinets
the coffee table goes through the front window
bucky yanks out all the drawers turns over the bed
he takes a pipe wrench to the sink crushes the mirror with one blow
in a terrible ten rounder with the ghosts of his past bucky demolishes the dream house pulls his uniforms out of the closet and bolts out of the house leaving
the door open so scavengers can pick the place clean
bucky sits on the bed his back pushed up against the wall
eyeball to eyeball with elizabeth short betty liz the black dahlia
a collage of photos and file folders
it came on then big and ugly bye bye bleichert at the bus stop adios shitbird has been never was stool pigeon harness bull
bucky stands in the worst of slums his blue uniform a beacon to anyone who would do him harm
voice over contd you traded a good woman for skunk pussy youve turned everything thats been handed you to pure undiluted shit your i wills amount to the eighth round
at the academy gym when you stepped into a blanchard right hand pratfalling into clover that you turned into horse dung
no clapsticks this time
just betty short sitting an the couch
she reaches down and pulls off her pumps
now she reaches under her dress and begins unrolling her stockings
empty and resigned
voice over contd bye bye betty beth betsy liz we were a couple of tramps too bad we didnt meet before th and norton it just might have worked
maybe us wouldve been the one thing we wouldnt have fucked up past redemption
an apartment complex has been erected at the murder site
angle on the hollywoodland sign
as we watch the sign changes the d dropping off the end
it now reads bucky unshaven and out of uniform leans against his car on a working class residential street
he stares across at a modest victorian house and the garage behind it
we recognize it hopefully weve been here before
its cleo shorts apartment
or at least it used to be
bucky peers in a window and sees its filled with junk
he walks back towards the street intent on heading back to his car
on a hunch he walks up onto the porch of the victorian house and rings the bell
footsteps at the door
it opens to reveal another identical twin to elizabeth short
bucky is stunned and cant find his tongue
boston accent can i help you
take a hike you big sicko wait she begins to shut the door but someone behind her pulls it back open
cleo short elizabeths father
its all right dear
i know this pug
the two men arrange themselves in chairs while the betty look a alike makes herself busy in the kitchen behind cleo
bucky tries not to stare
he forces himself to focus on cleo who while five years older looks much better than last time bucky saw him
came into a little change a while back managed to trade in that shit shack out back for these digs
beat and i dont give a fuck what you think you and your partner aint much to look at now
i read the papers
bucky cant deny that
the young woman brings in two beers for bucky and cleo
bucky checks her out again
cleo knows why
cleo short contd my youngest christine
he squeezes her hand affectionately
cleo short contd best housekeeper of the bunch
cant cook a damn though
got her sisters star eyes for the pictures damn straight
thinks shes gonna be another goddamn jayne mansfield
get out of here chrissie
she rolls her eyes picks up a newspaper and heads out on the porch
cleo short contd used to be dozensd stop by you know
drive up from dago or san berdoo just to snap a shot of the goddamn garage back there
thought maybe theyd find one of bettys dresses in the garbage
you didnt move far
wouldnt a mattered if i did
beat whatcha here for mug
i know you aint smart enough to solve the case and you aint dumb enough to still think i did it
i had an alibi
tightern a popcorn fart
and thats air tight mug
bucky takes a swig of his beer
cleos eyes scour bucky
cleo short contd youre hooked on her still aint ya
thats a plug nickel you cant spend aint it mug
bettyll do that to a fella
especially someone like you
off buckys look like i said i know you mug
i just thought
maybe after all this time
theres something you might have forgot
anything she might have said
cleo studies him knows buckys a lost soul
he softens for the first time
leans forward elbows on knees
almost looking like a father whod lost a daughter
she was a terrible actress
im sure folksve told you that
shed practice in front of the john mirror
once or twice she got me in on it
reading parts with her for some audition
even a parent could tell
what beth was good at was writing
all her teachers used to say that
not that a grease like med know the difference
maybe she coulda written for the pictures
but she wanted to be an actress like every other silly girl
his gaze drifts outside to his youngest daughter
cleo short contd your folks still alive
poking he proud of his son the ace copper
or maybe he thought youd end up champ
bucky shrugs off any talk of his father
cleo gets it
she killed herself a long time ago
cleo takes a swig of his beer
probably better off then
cleo follows bucky out onto the porch
christine reads a copy of photoplay
the cover touts the current mack sennett revival in honor of the revised hollywoodland sign
thank you for your time mr
if get a life bleichert
dont dream it all away
dreaminll kill ya
to christine you too
get me a sandwich
he snatches away the photoplay and slaps it into buckys hands
cleo short contd clean up some dog shit with this for me willya
the man winks
bucky takes the magazine and salutes him with it
he heads back down the walk
behind him cleo short watches him go
bucky sits at a light staring north
scaffolding drapes the hollywoodland sign
movie lights have been set up capturing the event on film
his attention turns to christines photoplay on the seat next to him the weekly rag is open to an ad for the mack sennett revival a reproduction of the hollywoodland
sign across the top of the page and below it the words keystone kops at the admiral theater air conditioned
below that a still from a keystone kops movie registering huge and loud and wrong three keystone kops standing between pillars shaped like snakes swallowing their own tails a wall
inset with egyptian hieroglyphics was behind them
unmistakably the background that appeared in the linda martin betty short porn film
cars honking behind him
buckys transfixed by the image
the light is green
he jerks upright and squeals out of the intersection
bucky buys a ticket underneath a marquee which reads mack a keystone kop short in progress
bucky can barely sit down to watch
i tried to keep calm
i told myself that just because emmett sprague helped mack sennett build sets in the twenties didnt mean he had anything to do with a smut film twenty five years
and theres a shot of the porn set the keystone kops running around in it like theyre solving at crime back in ancient egypt
voice over contd duke wellington had admitted making it
linda martin had said it was shot in mexico
the short ends with a large pie throwing scene on the porn set
the credits begin to roll director mack sennett
scenarist mack sennett
assistant director emmett sprague on buckys face as one last piece of information hits him filmed in hollywood usa
as bucky bursts out into the evening the lights on the hollywood hill catching his attention
bucky at dinner with the spragues
helped him build that housing project he was putting up hollywoodland as bucky stares up at the sign
bucky tears through it pulling out files
the door opens its russ millard
i got your message bucky
i may have it
bucky whirls around gesturing to the room her
ive got a hot one padre
bucky flops onto the bed almost frantic
calm down son
bucky meets his eyes forgive me my sins
bucky drives with russ in the car next to him
i told him everything
me and madeleine the spragues
withholding evidence for her
after all of it he only had one thing to say on russ all right then
its your ball
what do you wanna do
i want to search every fucking inch of every goddamn acre of emmett sprague property if it takes the rest of my shitty career
and i know exactly where we start
as they inch their way up into a huge traffic snarl in beachwood canyon
the sign looms high above them as the a is taken dawn
between my time with madeleine and the local boom baron expose in the papers i was practically an expert on emmett spragues land deals
a huge area is cordoned off as people watch the sign being torn down
bucky and russ leave the car there badge the local blue doing crowd control and split off down a dirt side road into the woods
voice over contd for the first time since the beginning of the whole fiasco i stopped trying to figure out who killed elizabeth short
instead i focused on where
bucky and russ play a flashlight over a piece of paper like two men consulting a treasure map in the woods
in the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown out and the door hanging off its hinges
and if my hunch was right we wouldnt have to look any further than one of emmett spragues condemned bungalows
one that was isolated
they walk on leaving this particular bungalow behind
bucky shines the light in a running stream as they follow it deeper into the night
and most importantly close to a water source
where one could drain a body of its blood
bucky and russ round a bend in the stream and see teetering on the edge of the stream
empty window and doors hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death leer
bucky and russ feel it tensing up as they approach
they pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and step into the abandoned house
a scattering of trash in the front room animal shit a bicycle tire rags
they move through the house each roam each closet and corner creeps with potential violence
from the kitchen bucky
bucky joins russ at the back door the screen rotted off
through the empty window they see an aluminum gardening shed the door wide open
you know it before they even get there
but as soon as they step inside
they know something bad happened here
half the room is taken up by a mattress its blue ticking stained dark brown with blood
a gas lantern sits in the corner leaning against a stack of blood spattered books including a copy of grays anatomy and victor hugos the man who laughs along with
a clutch of pornographic pictures
god help her
buckys already pulling on a pair of rubber gloves from his sid days
for the first time we notice hes carrying his forensic kit
he opens it revealing the test tubes fingerprint powder tweezers etc
throwing russ gloves box up the books and papers
maybe light that lantern
russ grants bucky his take charge attitude
he snaps on a pair of gloves
bucky scrapes blood off a wall and into a test tube
russ flips through the pornographic material some of it very intense
bucky fills up another test tube with dark hair tweezed from the caked blood on the mattress
underneath the mattress bucky finds small pieces of rope
bucky measures a bloody sole print and traces it onto a piece of paper
bucky finger prints the whole fucking place pulling good prints from the door jamb the door and the wall near the head of the mattress
russ fiddles with the books making himself busy
finally he walks back inside
bucky sits on the floor his hands shaking as he holds a fingerprint plate in one hand and a piece of paper in the other
you all right
bucky hands him the fresh plate
russ studies it
bucky hands him the piece of paper with a blown up set of prints on it
the two sets of prints are identical
russ sees the name at the top of the paper elizabeth short
he exhales deeply
thing is russ
theres another set of latents up there on the doorjamb
and my handsre shaking so bad i cant transfer em
bucky sits on the ground outside
the last of the land letters has come down and a party has ensued
a marching band plays theres no business like show business
bucky and russ stumble out of the woods carrying the evidence of betty shorts death in their hands
bucky sits on the bed the evidence spread out around him
russ stands in the doorway
we finally have it russ
all of it
all of her
gesturing around the room all right here
are you sure you dont want to came home
millardll fix up the couch
ill stay here
re the doorjamb piece i want to get up early and confirm these prints
youre a very very bright penny officer
he closes the door leaving bucky alone with elizabeth
bucky lies on the bed staring at the ceiling
bucky contd that night i pictured myself the way i wanted elizabeth to picture me her knight in shining armor a reborn two bit harness bull who cracked the biggest
unsolved homicide in california history
a war hero a heavyweight champion
bucky flips through grays anatomy killing time
bucky contd i stayed with her that night and dreamed of all the bullshit that would never happen
not if i wanted to keep my job at all
because there was no way for me to make the arrest without admitting that id suppressed evidence years ago
the case would always be open
and so while it killed me to wait til morning in some ways
this was our last night together
bucky transfers the killers prints from the doorjamb to a plate
bucky pulls a fingerprint card from a cabinet
he shuts the cabinet
the tab on the outside reads city employees
bucky edges his way along the side of the house
a side window is open and he pulls himself inside
moving boxes fill the front hallway
bucky hears voices coming from the main hall
madeleine and emmett
bucky unholsters his gun from his pocket he pulls out a silencer and screws it on the muzzle
besides one of my foremen said the goddamn pipes are spewing gas
therell be hell to pay
its about time i showed the three of you good ol scotland
i dont wanna go to europe daddy
youre always talking about how dreadful and provincial it is
theyve got what you need lassie
bucky steps into the main room gun prominent at his side
and what is that emmett
saps like me
direct line to the straight dope
or is that what you needed
he eyes the gun
george tilden killed elizabeth short and the two of you covered it up
on the spragues trying to maintain their upper class cool
bucky contd to madeleine you helped linda martin and betty make that stag film
where was the set
in one of daddys old buildings
he levels the gun at madeleine
madeleine sits on a divan
georgie was always
sneaking around daddys properties
he saw them make it
got crazy about betty
she looked like his daughter
off emmetts shocked look bucky contd he fucked your wife
but i dont think you cared about that
but hes her daddy
and that must have made you crazy
he was a handsome bastard too
somehow i dont think he was disfigured in a car wreck
in the argonne georgie used to bayonet the dead gerries
i saw it
thrilled him it did
i think ramona found him
a good way to strike back at me
bucky points the gun at madeleine again
howd it all go down
he shoots a ming vase next to her
bucky contd so many pretty things here
it was sunday i remember
short of cash as usual
i put daddy on and he offered betty money to date a nice man he knew
georgied been driving daddy crazy wanting to get with betty ever since the movie
threatening to tell people he was my father
but we thought georgie just wanted her for sex
bucky blows away another objet dart
the two spragues huddle on the couch
he was a sick fuck and you knew it
emmett gestures vainly towards the stuffed dog balto
he was passive
he liked to touch dead things
his father was a surgeon did you know that
famous in scotland
what did you tell betty
what did you tell her
we said he was a war hero
because we didnt want her to feel like a whore
you know the rest
pretend im stupid
for old times sake
madeleine exhales hate
i went looking for linda martin and i found her at a motel in the valley
i gave her money and told her to say the stag was filmed in tijuana with a mexican crew
and then what
i come along
daddy tell you to fuck me or was that your idea
bucky two more shots from the gun destroy another fifty grand worth of art
bucky contd the whole family have a good laugh at dinner that night
pumping me for info about the case
throwing me georgie stories to see if id bite
a little hospitality and some cunt so i wouldnt check out your alibi bucky ramona didnt know a thing
martha what about sweet little martha
martha knew id been with betty
but that was all
but shes a demon you know
she even called the cops with a tip on la vernes just hoping id get smeared in the papers
i scratched her good for that
martha tell you this
she nods yes
then she lied to get your goat cuz no one ever called in a tip on lavernes
emmett clears his throat
what are you gonna do
emmett walks to a small desk
he reaches into the drawer bucky puts his gun to emmetts head dont insult me lad
he pulls out the four passports not a gun
bucky takes them
well ruin you in court you know
if you go after us well ruin you
some little slut bucky blows a hole in a vase some six inches from her
he cocks his head at her as if to say the next one will be closer
you know laddie
the rich dont necessarily own art just for themselves we safekeep it for future generations
the dig crosses through buckys mind for a moment before he shooes it away
to emmett i need to see it
just to be sure
i need to see it
im not sure i know
bucky puts the silenced muzzled half an inch from spragues brain
i need to see his grave you tightass kiltwearing motherfucker
whered you bury george tilden
bucky stands in front of a plain grave marker george tilden
war hero and loyal friend when id pulled georges print card that morning id already laid fifty down with russ that he was our guy
amateur taxidermist transient
if he was a cop th and norton woulda been right in the middle of his beat
bucky pulls tildens card and we see the close up george tilden
added by hand deceased but id be lying if i said i hadnt wanted to nail the sicko myself giving him ten rounds of bleichert rage
bucky watches as russ tips the gas lantern over on its side the gas leaking out into the tin shed
maybe hed have gone for a gun or probably a knife and the bleichert fists wouldve given way to a full load of
in the chest
bucky and russ step outside
russ lights a match and tosses it inside
flames begin to eat away the bloody mattress
voice over contd sprague said they found him croaked in a parking lot downtown just twelve blocks from where hed dumped betty short
natural causes if anything about crazy georgie was natural
i hoped the evil ate him from the inside out filling him with blackness like the sawdust in spragues goddamn dog
beat bucky kicks the tin door shut sealing the fire inside elizabeth shorts private hell
bucky and jane chambers drink some iced tea
and then eldridge said im sure thats the case mr
mayor but thats not my dog and those sure as hell arent my shoes
they laugh jane a bit more than bucky
she narrows in on him
jane chambers contd its so nice of you to stop by again
of course youve been staking out the sprague house
four nights in a row
off his surprise i walk my dog every night
and im almost as nosy as you
covering yeah well
old habits die hard
he gets up from the table
bucky wanders over and stares at the slash mouthed clown painting always transfixed by it
re the painting id been thinking about giving it to charity but its too valuable
i found eldridges receipt
she wanders into the study and fishes out some papers from her late husbands desk while bucky continues to stare at the clown
she returns reading from the sale slip
jane chambers contd its a frederick yannantuono original inspired by an old classic novel the man who laughs by victor hugo
a blood spattered copy of the man who laughs on the pile of pornography as the slash mouthed clown towers over bucky his head buzzing
jane chambers contd the clown in the painting is the books main character gwynplain
when he was a child he had his mouth slashed ear to ear and then sold to the th century spanish aristocracy to be used as a court jester
bucky steps back
jane chambers contd are you all right bucky
yes im fine
he focuses on her
bucky contd whered eldridge get the painting
youll appreciate the coincidence she hands him the receipt
received from eldridge chambers for the sale of the f
ramona cathcart sprague january
what is it hes out the door
bucky runs to his car pulls out his gun
he sprints off down the street
bucky waits outside watching from behind a tree
he watches as the last of the cars madeleines pulls out of the driveway
he crosses the street
he tries the front door surprised to find it unlocked
he goes inside
gun drawn bucky cases the downstairs
he hears a noise
im in here officer
a red wave of sweat washes over him
he walks carefully into where the matriarch sits on a tiny sofa her arms lost in a silk dressing gown
her face puffy and her eyes dark her gray hair frizzy
bucky trains a gun on her
i know what you did ramona
you and georgia
ive seen the painting
you sold it the day of the murder
you know ive got the book
and now ive got you
very slowly she withdraws one of her hands from the folds of her dressing gown
she holds a tiny ladylike revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet
when she speaks its with complete control
we see you out there you know
we see you
you dont fool us
you didnt hurt georgie
you didnt hurt madeleine
and as much as i wish you would you didnt hurt emmett
youre a voyeur
thats all the lesser classes have
pressing their nose up against the glass
so tell me
let me see
she smiles at him again loving his need
emmett slashed his face im sure you know
madeleine was eleven and she looked just like georgie
when he got out of the hospital i gave him the hugo book as a present
but he was afraid of emmetts rage
we rarely spoke
bucky eases himself into a chair opposite her
tell me about betty short
her face hardens
ramona contd with venom it was the cruelest of jokes
hed become obsessed with her
that filthy film
your husband bought her for george
emmett never stopped hating me
for george for being richer than he was
she looks over her nose at him
ramona contd i followed them to the bungalow
there was a baseball bat under
under a tree
she tried to run from me
but she was drunk
the first swing knocked her out
i made georgie tie her to the mattress
the second swing woke her up
you tortured her
she seems to drift
ramona contd she looked so much like my maddy
the cruelest of jokes
her thousand yard stare gradually returns to bucky
ramona contd martha mustnt know
shes all thats left of this family that isnt dying
you consider her when you decide whether were worth it
buckys not sure what to say next
she fills the space quite well
ramona contd honestly though
sometimes i thought martha was going to bring the whole family down around her by chance
her little stunt about tipping the police to lavernes she lied about that
to get madeleines goat
ramonas eyes brighten up
oh is that so
you poor boy
your life is worse than mine
maybe the cruel joke is on you
she speaks with such an insanity and calm it frightens him
and on buckys hungry eyes we buckys car peeling out of hancock park
kay sits at her desk grading papers
bucky bursts in
how much of the hundred grand did lee let you keep
bucky and lee sit at the tip desk while lee listens to a very long call saying nothing
kay and bucky stare each other down
he knew about madeleine sprague
he knew about lavernes hideaway
lee blanchard beats the hell out of emmett sprague while madeleines looks on
he blackmailed sprague dont come over
daddys having a business soiree bucky bursts in on lee washing his bloody fists
penance for junior nash buckys leaning on the desk
and you knew it kay
you knew it all
he took that hundred thousand and split to mexico and you let him go
kay fingers the edges of an exam
she looks him in the eye
you are so so good at some things
he absorbs the blow and waits for her to continue
he was going to leave no matter what
i didnt know if i was ever going to see him again and i wanted him to be comfortable if such a thing was possible
dwight he knew i was in love with you and he wanted us to be together
he didnt leave he ran
he ran from the bank job ran from the frame on dewitt
he knew who killed elizabeth short and fucking ran away
this whole time
you both knew everything kay slams down a book
that girl that girl
i dont give a damn about that girl
she ruined our lives
the room grinds to a halt
kay contd he loved us
dont take that away from him
and i love you
and if you hadnt seen so much of yourself in her youd realize how much you loved me
beat so if youre aware of something more important than that
id like to hear what it is
bucky looks like hes about to burst
he wants to go to her lock her in his arms and forgive
instead he just backs up three steps slowly turns on his heels and walks out
bucky sits in the back of the bar shrouded in smoke and loud music
he drinks bourbon and watches madeleine over at the bar
shes got her hand on a soldiers knee
madeleine sprague and the soldier boy walk from the office over to the now familiar room
they enter shutting the door and flicking on the light to reveal sitting on the back of a chair with his feet on the seat
he trains his silenced pistol on them
flashing his badge he points the soldier to the door quoting lee adios yourself back to the halls of tripoli shitbird
ive got business with the lady
you dont have to tell the soldier twice
he backs out and shuts the door
ive been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week
but i havent had much of a chance to shoot anybody
i think youd rather fuck me than kill me
but you dont have the guts to do either
youre a boxer
not a puncher
scotchmans burr aaaah lassie
you wanna sell me short to the very end eh
now shes curious
bucky contd its not as good as yours ill admit
but then again youve got an ear for accents
accents dressing up in costumes
maybe a trace of fear in her eyes
bucky contd do another one for me
play someone else
rich little slut
play someone else
i dont know what youre talking about he cocks the gun
how bout the mexican accent you used when you hired the private dick to track down lee
lets see the make up job
lets see the fucking dress mamacita that you wore when you chased after poor daddys money
tell me something you shoot lee yourself
she steps back against the door as he advances
bucky contd did you at least have the guts to shoot him yourself
he puts the gun to her forehead
youll never do it
i look like her
she grins wickedly
he pulls the gun from her head and shoots her in the kneecap
cap cars flashing lights an ambulance
we took the fall together
madeleine is interrogated by homicide dicks
ever the consummate actor madeleine sprague confessed to killing lee by concocting a love triangle from the three of us
the bleichert blanchard rematch fought over her hand with lee beating emmett and demanding he hand over his daughter when she preferred me
as madeleine dressed as a mexican woman in heavy makeup and a large hat tails lee back to his motel
voice over contd madeleine stalking lee
revenge killing him in ensenada to avenge the sprague honor
no mention of the black dahlia murder case at all
madeleine led away amongst a flock of photographers
her family linked arm and arm in the background crying only martha looking like she might survive
voice over contd her storys enough to get her a psych tag as a delusional schizophrenic and ten years at atascadero state hospital
bucky sits at a table staring into the one way mirror
so the brass girl took the fall for the whole family
and i took the fall for me
iad cleared me on the motel shooting a cops code make good for blanchards snuff
we pull out and see buckys cuffs badge and gun sitting on the table in front of him
voice over contd afterwards i was fired from the los angeles police department on grounds of moral turpitude and conduct unbecoming an officer
i thought of turning over ramona in hopes of pulling a grandstanders turnabout
the camera drifts through the one way mirror revealing russ millard standing on the other side
but i had people to protect
people who already knew that for the briefest of times and in the darkest of places i had been so so good at some things
bucky standing amongst the dahlia files
he begins pulling photos off the walls
the destroyed fairy tale house is in mid repair
kay is in work clothes painting a new trim in the living room
the front door opens
bucky stands in the doorway carrying a box of dahlia files
kay watches as he crosses the room without a word and dumps the box of files into the fireplace
he tosses on a match and the box goes up in flames
she moves to him
we arrive just as she exits the outline of her body quickly disappearing into the blackness beyond the office door
thank you elizabeth
