b if window
href b b the screen is black
when you hear thunder
a black bowling ball pulls away from the lens
the ball is in the hands of theo skinner an intense handsome year old man with sideburns dressed in worn bowling attire
god is bowling
he holds the ball in front of him wristbrace on his face a study in concentration
an empty causeway spans a bay somewhere along the south shore of long island
the sky is overcast
sheila a woman in her late twenties wearing a full length heliotrope pleather coat over a waitress outfit kneels in the middle of the road
a souped up vespa motor scooter stands nearby
sheila holds a bridal barbie and ken doll set
she sets them down on the road pulls out a can of lighter fluid and soaks the dolls
she pulls out a bowling pin shaped lighter and torches the nuptial tableau
theo drives his ratty old american car along a highway
the car has ohio plates
he sucks coffee from a eleven big swig cup and examines a map
a yellow plastic bowler on board sign is stuck to a side window
theos music plays
his eyes nod off then snap awake
the screen is black except for three circles in the middle of the screen
the light shining through them is snuffed out by three large pink objects
there is a loud pop like a thumb being pulled out of a tight hole
a slow motion low tracking shot of a bowling ball hitting a polished lane
close up of the milky white surface of two bowling pins on opposite sides of the lane a seven ten split
the rumbling ball is heard in the distance like a furious hulking steamroller of doom
the pins begin to tremble and then transform into a bridal ken and barbie
the dolls burst into flame
the ball blasts past the camera and metamorphoses into theos car
theos sedan blasts past the camera down the empty road
the flaming couple stand in the middle of the bridge
theos car hits the pair and they fly into the air in slow motion
a distant sound of pins scattering is heard
the two dolls smoke as they spin into the sky then hit the water with dual hisses
an american machine and foundry pin reset machine performs its functions like a mechanical ballet as the camera follows a bowling ball through its journey
the spare me
theme music similar to balboa blue by the marketts swells
title spare me
appears on the bowling ball
pins tumble across the back plate are loaded into the pin conveyor lifted up to the crown feeder distributed into the rotating carousel and then set down in perfect formation
upon the polished bowling alley
burn in principal player titles
titles appear on the pins
the ball trundles along the return trough straight into the lens
a muzak cover of broke busted and disgusted plays in the background as theo gingerly pulls a hot taco out of the microwave oven
alfie the rickety old man who runs the store shuffles up to the self serve island and begins wiping it down
theo pokes at the taco with a spork as steam rises
he pulls a disgusted grimace
alfie pours himself a cup of coffee and then attempts to open a tiny container of half half
because his hands are shaking so much the cream goes everywhere but into the coffee
im an addict
i cant go through a day without the stuff
theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand
youre not from around here are you
im from akron
alfie looks at theos bowling shoe attired feet
you a bowler
theos hand starts shaking uncontrollably
he puts down the cream
im looking for a man
what kind of man
alfie presses a matchbook into theos hand and then trundles off
theo looks down at the matchbook it reads bowl for health enjoy yourself
theo pulls into the empty parking lot of babylon lanes beside a cheap looking american sedan
theo walks into an empty run down forty lane bowling alley carrying his ball bag
it is dark
the fluorescent lights switch on and the pin re set machines whirr into action
sid and breeze two shady looking guys in a basement sale suits walk up lane dividers towards theo
lanes closed big fellah league night
im not here to bowl
gesturing to theos bag you drag that coconut around for your health or do you know how to use it
bristling at the challenge im looking for somebody
hey aint i seen you on the tour
no pinhead he aint here to bowl
im looking for buzz fazeli
sid and breeze look sideways at each other
i dont know no buzz fazeli
what do you want with old man faz
some unfinished business
if you wanna do business in this town theres other people around here got more weight than old faz
a lady dwarf walks by
evening sid evening breeze
good luck tonight tina
tina opens a door and goes down some stairs
you guys got something going on downstairs
we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community
breeze sniggers into his hand smirks yeah basement bingo
lemme see your ball
breeze grabs theos bag
let go of my bag
sid sidles around behind theo who tries to keep him in sight
ah come on lemme see your ball
you afraid were gonna steal it
breeze unzips the bag and pulls the ball out
theos temper is rising he breathes deeply
he is obviously making a herculean effort to keep himself in check
i said let go of my bag
with lightning speed theos hand shoots out and grabs the middle fingers on sids right hand
sid howls in agony
those are my bowling fingers
tell your little pal to let go
breeze give him his ball back
breeze astonished drops theos ball into the bag
sid cringes in front of theo
where can i find buzz fazeli
whoa cool your maples
over the bridge past the peter pan last house on the dead end
theo releases sids hand
sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand
havent seen a ball like that since
it belonged to my dad
theo turns and walks out
junior a dumpy man in his late thirties with a rat tail bad skin and wearing a white straitjacket and fluorescent orange pants runs desperately through dark woods
bloodhounds bark in the distance
theo drives over the draw bridge and past the peter pan diner with its huge neon sign
theos car pulls up in front of a modest suburban house
a rooftop weather vane in the shape of a bowler creaks ominously in the wind
theo rings the doorbell
the porch light comes on and millie a fifty five year old woman dressed for a night on the town in reno but with fuzzy slippers and a hairnet opens
a miniscule neurotic poodle leaps at theos bowling ball bag yapping and snapping at it
fazeli in please
who wants to know
to dog zeus
im a bowler
im sick of you people
why dont you leave him be
let him in millie
and dont frisk him
millie and theo with zeus hot on his trail enter the room
buzz fazeli a sixty five year old man shaped a lot like a compressed bowling pin slouches in a recliner
the room is decorated with trophies of buzzs bygone pro bowling halcyon days
let everyone in
from now on i leave the door wide open
let the parade begin
millie is silent
buzz gets up and approaches zeus
zeus growls at buzz as he comes nearer then clamps onto his sleeve and hangs from his arm growling ferociously
in one smooth motion buzz flings the rabid poodle through an open window and into the night
she heads outside
theo sits on the edge of the couch
buzz puts out his hand
theo shakes it
i know your face youre an up and comer
you bowl on the tour
im not on the tour this year
nods understandingly need some advice huh
fazeli the bowling congress says im a thorn in their side
dismissive wave dont worry about the congress theyre just a bunch of moralistic busy bodies
millies furry slippers protrude from the drivers side door
zeus chews furiously on the yellow plastic bowler on board sign
she rifles through the contents of the overstuffed glove compartment
she notices her dog
under her breath get that outta your mouth
they suspended me
whyd they suspend you
theos eyes glaze over the lights in the room dim and buzz seems to recede into the far distance
in ultra slow scan we see an image of two bowlers one is smiling cockily to off screen fans and waving the other is theo his face filled with hate
winding up to smash the other man in the head with his bowling ball
it wasnt really my fault
in the far background the hollow booming voice of a judge delivers sentence
the american bowling congress hereby suspends theo maynard skinner from all professional bowling activities within the jurisdiction of the american bowling congress and its international co signers
the ball mashes into the smirking mans head causing it to snap forward
the judges gavel bangs and the crowd roars
theo snaps out of it the room lights come up and buzz leans in
i got suspended when i was young too
i was pretty cocky in my day
they suspended me for years
knits his brow i can appeal in five
i was hoping you could help me mr
uneasy what do you think i can do
sweating slightly i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back
where i come from youre the king
sure around here any fat old bald guy could be king
it wouldnt do any good for me to talk to the congress
briskly changing subject hey you thirsty
you like orange whips
ive never had orange whips im from akron
millie and buzz are in the kitchen talking in loud whispers
millie fills a blender while buzz cuts oranges
hes the guy buzz
hes not the guy millie
just whip the whips
i looked in his car
hes got pictures of you clippings maps
bowlers dont go around killing other bowlers
hes only a fan millie
ill give him some tips and an autograph and hes outta here
youre in trouble arent you buzz
youre doing something dangerous in that alley
millie i know what im doing
we should leave this town
i cant take this anymore
im not gonna let him kill you in my house
buzz rejoins theo in the living room
remember the finals in akron in
you had a seven ten split in the final frame
yeah against that prick vandemark
ten thousand to one but you pegged it
the toughest shot on the last frame
that game was before you was born
my mom was there
she told me about it
the fazeli split
the blender is wailing at high speed as millie throws in a whole box of laxative a can of drano and a jar of pills
her hands are trembling
millie walks into the living room with a silver tray holding two orange whips one thick and deadly the other thin and safe
there is laughter coming from both men
and the irony is thirty years later that prick is bowling in the seniors on tv all over the world and look at me
the docs made me stop on account of my ticker
taps his chest i dont really miss it but then
chokes up i miss it
he spies millie approaching with the tray
orange whip nectar of the bowling gods
millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip
theo takes the other glass
zeus is on the sofa growling and tugging at theos bowling bag
the bag rips apart and the ball hits the floor
theo brings the drink to his lips
the ball rolls across the room
the ball rolls into buzzs feet
this your lucky bullet
buzz picks it up and reads the writing on the ball
he snaps a look into the kitchen seeing the empty drano and laxative cartons
buzz slams the drink away from theos lips
the drink explodes across the room
buzz is up on his feet
with intensity whered you get this ball
stunned looks at the mess on the floor then at buzz its mine
who gave it to you
astonished grace skinner
whos grace skinner to you
shes my mom
theo stands and takes the ball from buzzs hands
buzz is in shock staring at theo
regaining his voice who are you
who sent you here
im your son
youre a hard father to find
to millie millie please
to theo i dont have a son
i think you better leave now young man
buzz gestures towards the front door
calmly grace skinner fazeli you must remember her
buzz takes theo by the elbow to eject him from the house
i dont know no grace skinner
pulls his arm away you knew her
you married her in
buzz grabs a large bowling trophy and waves it at theo
youre a bullshit artist thats what you are
you got no right to be here
theo yanks the trophy away from buzz
i got a right
youre my father
i aint nobodys father
theo hurls the trophy at buzz
he ducks and the trophy sails into a large glass trophy case
broken glass and trophies fly everywhere
noticing zeus zeus is laid out cold near the spilled orange whip on the living room floor
millie hunches over her comatose poodle
my poor baby
to theo you see what you did
he picks up the ball take your ball and get out
theo takes the ball and exits the house
theo bathed in sweat practices his release form with obsessive determination
he is alone near the empty bridge
sheila spies on him from behind the bridge control booth
theo takes a long slug from a bottle of liquor
he hears a motor scooter start and roar off into the night
theo stands at the self serve island sipping coffee
a muzak cover of raindrops keep falling on my head plays
resignedly years days looks at his watch hours and minutes of no bowling
alfie shuffles up to the self serve island and begins wiping it down
find your bowler
yeah but it didnt go so good
he wasnt the man i thought hed be
theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup but his hands are trembling spilling some of the coffee
my father used to say to me never
love and hate are blood relations
maybe i should have left the ball in the car
millie kneels on the front lawn patting dirt down on a little grave marked by a wooden cross
theo walks up
hes not here
im sorry about zeus millie
points to grave this is a sign
someones coming to take buzz away from me
i dont know if youre the guy or what but im not letting it happen
im leaving him first
i couldnt kill buzz
i need his help
theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car
buzz fazeli never helps anybody but himself
hes my father millie
hes no father to you
theo lifts a box full of new bowling pins into the trunk
careful with that one
he wont tell me anything but i know theres something strange going on over at the lanes
if you ask me id say the old fart wants to die
where can i find him
looks at her watch the peter pan
millie gets into the car
you tell buzz i went to my sisters in ronkonkoma
oh im sorry about trying to kill you last night theo
it was nothing personal
millie puts on a pair of sunglasses and patches out in a cloud of gravel and dust
a blender whirrs
sheila in her waitress uniform carefully chops something
she watches an indoor motocross rally on the diners color tv
pack a hefty construction worker sits at the counter
hey sheila hows that orange whip comin
mimicking him under her breath hows that orange whip comin
sheila is dismembering a ken doll with a big knife
she scoops the parts into the blender and switches from purze to frappz
so i heard junior busted out again
sheila puts the glass down in front of pack with a thunk
hey sheila you can whip my oranges anytime
sheila puts a barbie head earring on her left ear
buzz comes into the diner and slides into a booth
sheila walks over with a pot of coffee
cup of joe mr
yeah and make it extra muddy i didnt sleep a zee last night
sheila fills a cup
buzz lifts it to his mouth his hands trembling
you dont need coffee mr
fazeli you need a vacation
sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot
she puts a ken head earring in her right ear
buzz follows sheilas gaze
groans some people will do anything for an autograph
theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz
millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma
you know what a mixer ball is
its like you you come out of nowhere and upset things scattering everything all over
buzz grumpily waves at him to sit
what are you doing over at the lanes thats so dangerous buzz
you shouldnt listen to her shes a nervous old nellie
she thinks someones trying to kill you
i couldnt pay someone enough to try to kill me
sheila comes over to take their orders
ill have my usual please sheila
buzz burger side of cues
you havent introduced me to your fan
leans in to theo sardonically i forget the name
this is sheila kastle my partners daughter
eyeing theo up and down you look like youre something on the lanes
theos bowled on the tour
oh a professional man
whatll you have
whats your specialty
then ill have the number four with one of your finest whips
how do you want it
their eyes meet the eggs
discomfited at the blatant double entendre uh
coming right up
sheila smiles and walks away
theo watches her slink behind the counter
watch out for that one
shes got a great average but shes looking for a prince
and believe me shes more kissed a lotta tadpoles
looking theo in the eye listen i been thinking about your problem
im not the guy to sponsor you
it would be unethical
but there is something i could do for you
leans in secretively putt putt golf
putt putt golf
buzz pulls a golf ball from his pocket flashes it and slips it back
its the next level the next dimension
deep conviction the small ball
in buzzs spell the small ball
its gonna be bigger than big
they dont have room for real golf courses in japan
snapping out of it not for me
miniature golfs for pansies
if the japanese are pansies then pansies are my kind of people
sheila steps over to the booth with their food
the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball
buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner
pondering the thought maybe i could bowl in japan
buzz stands up abruptly
i gotta wash up
buzz heads for the rest rooms
the door opens with a jingle
when you get a chance
sid and breeze walk over to theos booth and slide in
sids middle fingers are taped to an aluminum splint
the blender kicks into action
buzz watches the group from the bathroom hall and tries to catch the conversation
hey you still here
were looking for buzz fazeli seen him
i dont know no buzz fazeli
look sid a buzz burger
the fazs favorite lunch
sid reaches for the plate
buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid
get away from that burger
sorry faz we didnt know you was here
kastle wants to talk to you
to theo and buzz are you guys bruddas
the booth party is silent for a moment
no we aint brothers
you know why we call him breeze
sid puts a hand near breezes left ear and blows into breezes right ear
he makes fluttering motions with his hand as if wind was hitting it
breezes face breaks into a smile as he pushes sid away
hey cut it out sid that tickles
you guys are related right
hes my dad
buzz flashes a warning glare to theo
sid grabs some of buzzs french fries
slapping his hand get your own
see that toldja sid
i knew i seen a resemblance
why dont you clowns get your whips and get lost
look faz mr
kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you
gazing artfully upwards and rubbing his chin what was that he said
i remember sid
kastle says he dont like no sticky fingers in the till
dont just blurt it right out
sheila comes over and plunks down the three whips to go
to sheila your pop said to put these on his tab
sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door
so buzz lets skedaddle
kastle is waiting
as buzz gets up theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs
im coming with you
sid shies away from theo protecting his hand
i got business to do theo
ill come back and haunt you later
drops a twenty on the table pats theos cheek dont say i never gave you nothing
buzz goes outside with a sleazeball on either side
sheila takes the twenty dollar bill
theo grabs his jacket and makes for the door
to sheila do those two work for your dad or mine
mine and they never tip
the sleazeballs hustle buzz into the front seat of their car and patch out
do you know where theyre taking him
buzz runs the lanes there for my dad
everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad
junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush
junior slows down and drops to his knees gasping for breath
he looks up to the sky
the camera pushes up to his sweaty tortured face
shrieks miles kastle lounges in a cheap chair behind buzzs desk toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures they have in airport souvenir concessions
he is a carefully groomed middle aged low budget version of hugh hefner in an acrylic sweatsuit with miles o lanes embroidered on the front
sid and breeze push buzz into the room
buzz is poker faced
to breeze you got my whip
breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him
motions to sid and breeze lose yourselves
sid and breeze leave the room
buzz goes to a locker and begins changing into a flashy mc outfit
whats on your mind miles
weve been partners a long time now havent we buzz
kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag
this scam we got going here was your more brainstorm buzz
i admit i thought it was a rotten idea but i put up the scratch
pulls a smile and now we got a beautiful thing
its a beautiful thing
a beautiful thing
and you know why buzz
you know what we got
buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt
we got balance
kastle flicks the little wire man
it bobs and sways
a partnership is a very delicate balance
but lets say something tips the scales maybe one partner takes more than his share then
kastle tips the wire man off his perch
the little motor squeals pathetically
we got no more balance
buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat
and look at that both partners go down together
kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor stands up and crushes it under his heel
he goes over and puts his arm around buzz
simple math buzz
he holds up his fingers two plus two does not equal three
miles ive always been on the square with you
im sure you have buzz
wish me luck
buzz jogs out into a spotlight
break a leg
applause erupts as buzz appears in the spotlight
the dwarf bowling alley is a pungently smoke filled room peopled with shady washed up bowlers sitting in chairs behind a bowling lane
the old timers are shouting and pounding shots
over the pa greetings ladies gentlemen
the place grows silent my dentist told me this one the other day how many bowlers does it take to screw in a lightbulb
it takes three bowlers to screw in a lightbulb
one to hold the bulb one to turn the ladder and one to hold their balls
thank you thank you
just throw money
theo drives through the full parking lot of babylon lanes
he pulls around the back and sees dark figures slip into a back door
he parks his car walks over to the now closed door
theo finds another entrance and sneaks in
he creeps his way through the darkened alley towards the sound of raucous partying
welcome to buzz fazelis dwarf bowling folks where we bring you the finest in specialized bowling entertainment
through a crack in a door theo can see buzz standing in the spotlight
i would like to draw your attention to the top of the lane
a casio drum roll plays weighing in at sixty nine pounds and standing exactly three feet the diminutive dominatrix teeny weenie tina the terrible
the crowd cheers as the spotlight moves to tina a masked lady dwarf duded up in a combination black leather and cowhide western style s m outfit
she cracks a whip and leers at the bowlers
they howl with excitement
dont be shy folks
tina straps into her customized skateboard
a drunken customer forks over a wad of bills steps up and grabs hold of the mini human projectile
and bowl er
tina is hurled head first towards the pins
the crowd goes wild
the camera tracks low behind tina as she crashes into the pins
theo sneaks into an empty bathroom
he hears voices and ducks into a stall
sid and breeze shove buzz into the room
seems to me like you aint got much choice buzz
sid shoves buzz over to breeze breeze shoves him back
youre between miles kastle and a hard place
aaay hands off the tux
sid checks under the stalls sees theos feet and whips open the door
sid yanks theo out
get your hands off me you moron
theo tries to free himself from sids grip
he turns to buzz
what the fuck is this
whats it look like to you
it looks like dwarf bowling
very good busyboy
with intensity dwarf bowlings illegal
sarcastically what are you gonna do call the bowling police
heh heh heh
you said it would be unethical to help me
you call dwarf bowling ethical
i do what i gotta do to survive
you have no right to call yourself a bowler
buzz slaps theo in the face
im more of a bowler than youll ever be
i deal with my own shit
i aint asking anyone to bail me out
im your blood
theo pushes buzz up against a stack of boxes full of new bowling pins
sid and breeze hover behind them
you knew she was pregnant
buzz reaches inside a box and pulls out a pin
he waves it threateningly at theo
what makes you so sure it was me
she coulda had lotsa bowlers
theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm
the two men struggle for the pin
dont say that about my mom
i had a career
she wanted a little bowler of her own
sid and breeze leap into the fray prying the two men apart
they wrestle theo against a wall pressing his face into the tiles
fuck you and fuck bowling
thats a laugh
youre all strung out
youre a bowling junkie
i dont need the stinking pro tour
youre dead without the pro tour and you know it
get him away from me
sid and breeze punch theo in the face
theo is dragged through the dwarf alley crowd
he has blood on his face
half dazed he looks up at all the distorted leering faces that peer down at him
the crowd cat calls and laughs at theo
theo is thrown onto the asphalt
sid kicks theo
you shoulda taken our advice busyboy
theo sits in his parked car outside the peter pan diner
squinting in the bright light he examines the cuts on his face in the sideview mirror
he is looking scruffier
he sees sheila come out of the diner start her scooter and pull out into traffic
he follows her
he follows the vespa at a discreet distance as sheila drives over the bridge
the weather is windy and threatening
theo pulls in next to sheilas scooter under the big neon sign for miles o lanes bowling center
with a huge clap of thunder and the sound of falling pins the skies release a pounding downpour
sheilas vespa is parked in the handicapped space
the dolls are wired to the headset of the scooter
large droplets of rain roll down their faces
theo walks into an ultramodern eighty lane bowling center bowling bag in hand
a huge banner reads mothers and daughters bowl free tonight
the entire place is filled with pairs of moms and their daughters bowling away in matching bowling attire
a three year old girl stands staring at theo
a mom grabs the little girl and whisks her away
theo surveys the alley and catches sight of sheila bowling at the far end of the alley
sheila bowls with luna a ish black guy dressed in a miles o lanes jumpsuit and wearing extensions in his hair
sheila prods her friend when she sees theo
luna thats the guy
i saw him do this spooky bowling rain dance on the bridge
theo walks over
sheila presents theo with her ball
here theo its the fazeli specialty a seven ten split
theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing
im not here to i cant
sheila cant release the ball from theos now paralytic grip
knowing nod bowling block
kastle sid and breeze stare at a bank of video monitors their faces illuminated by the screens
think hell bowl it
nah he wont do it
weird comes into alleys and doesnt bowl
its not an alley
i hate when people call it a bowling alley its so common
i prefer bowling center
whats this guy here for anyway
maybe hes here to pay his last respects

sid and breeze look sideways at each other
i hired you rent a thugs to keep tabs on the faz

the two of them sit together behind the lanes

your dads one of the only nice people in this fucking town

kastle walks over
theo stands up and shakes kastles proffered hand
so youre buzzs boy
ive been expecting you
you hurt my feelings when you didnt come and see me sooner
you know who i am
nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it
you dont mind if i have a word with theo do you bunny
kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away
i heard youve been having a little trouble with the congress
waves at a mother daughter couple theo pulls his eyes off sheila
kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers
you might say im at the top of their shit list
maybe i can help you
calling to a young bowler try a lighter ball penelope youll get hurt with that big ball honey
to theo ive seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit
you got fazeli blood running through you
your pop was a genuine talent in his day
whats with the bad air between you two mr
dismissive gesture its nothing just a slight business imbalance
to a seated mother hows glorias thumb
the blisters worse than last week
no pain no gain

chin up sweetie
turning to theo this place is a bowling oasis
they pause and kastle waves to some bowlers
hows my favorite bowlerina doing

what do you think theo

to carmelita now go take out your big four darling
to theo come on were making her nervous
they continue walking
i get them while theyre young
she hit it mr
waving over his shoulder four or five years when a girl like thats bowling on the pro tour for team kastle shell pay a handsome profit on my investment
and the dwarf bowling
they stop and kastle pulls theo over to an enormous aquarium near the lounge
making sweeping gesture think of this business like a big aquarium
you gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top
more profits down there philanthropy up here
looks at theo besides it beats the pants off bingo
nice set up
if it springs a leak itll be because buzz is making waves
what if he wants to get out
chuckles hes earned an early retirement
sprays his mouth with binaca but enough about losers buzz fazeli is history
lets talk about your future
puts his arm around theo i wanna show you something
kastle and theo stand in front of the huge bank of video screens
r a c
renovate automate computerize
that my boy is the future
one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling
her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin
kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike
the little girl jumps with joy
what ever happened to just bowling
theres a lot of competition for amusement out there
you gotta adapt to survive
i like the sport the way it is
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling
you got ambition like a
you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way pssshht
puts his arm around theo maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good
pauses for effect i think i could help you theo
hes been waiting for this how mr
you need a sponsor i have influence
i could sponsor you
why would you help me
i like you theo
you bowl with soul
kastle turns to his video screens
but now that you mention it you could afford me one minor dispensation
theo follows his gaze to the screen
while youre in town i need you to keep an eye on my daughter for a couple of days
her big brother broke out of the mental hospital
theos eyes glaze over the lights in the office dim and kastle seems to recede into the far distance
as running footsteps are heard the camera whizzes down a darkened alley towards the pins
and i want someone watching out for sheila while hes uh loose
the heels of juniors running feet
juniors a problem child
he has a thing about wails theo snaps out of it the room lights come up and kastle points to her image on the tv screen
sheila turns and looks up at the video camera
theo and sheilas eyes seem to meet
theo freezes for a moment
i could do that
as the two men shake hands sheila flips the bird to the camera
one thing pointing to theos mid section keep the meat in the freezer
theo and sheila blast along the dark roadway on her vespa theo sitting behind sheila
shouting above the engine this is a vicious cycle
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do
isnt this technically a scooter
when im on my bike i feel like a wild person
she looks sideways at theo better than any sex ive ever had
kinda tough on the butt
everything has its drawbacks
where did your brother escape from
the mental hospital
what does he do
he follows me he tries to have sex with me and then they send him to the nut hut for a while and then he gets out and then he
follows me he tries to have sex with me they send him to the nut hut for a while
its a vicious cycle
sheila and theo motor across an empty beach parking field towards a lone station wagon
swing a delic music drifts from the parked vehicle
sheila pulls up beside the wagon
she leads theo towards a group of partying people at the tailgate of the car three white women three white men and luna
luna pulls a rubber hookah hose out of his mouth and offers it to theo
no thanks i dont hookah
theo you ever do the swing
theo shakes his head
these guys all work at the alley too
this is john susan jon suzanne jonathan and sue
everyone welcomes theo and sheila
screams dance break
luna throws himself into a wild body whip as the music throbs massively
luna and sheila do a wild jitterbug derived swing a delic dance surrounded by weaving white folk
one of the guys is on crutches has a neck brace a chest cast and one arm in a truss
he stands by the barbecue and flips burgers with his one free hand
theo walks over to him
hey man howyadoin
he wiggles his hand out of the end of his cast
theo shakes his fingers
dont tell me john
hey man welcome to our parking lot
lemme give you some advice if she asks you to dance make sure her brothers not around
somebody blew out juniors pilot light if you get my meaning
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks he breaks my arm tries to kill me
i swear man the guy thought i was a piata
if nobody else hadnt a been there he wouldnt have stopped
he woulda killed me
fuckin guy man just snapped
how do you like your burger
meets eyes with sheila uh
throws a blackened burger on theos styrofoam plate ill tell you one thing you wont see me around that alley with that freak on the loose
stay away from his ass and dont play any of his fuckin knock knock jokes
luna comes over to theo and grabs him
they start to dance
sheila wants me to show you a few steps before you two swing a delic
uneasily so youre the pinman around here
and one and two and yes i am
but no one gets them working like junior used to
and two and one
they call him the quasimodo of the lanes
hes the best pinman there is
and one and two
people used to say he got the machines working so well cause he lubricated them with blood
and two and one
but people just love saying things about junior
mind if i cut in
no not at all
theo pulls out his resin bag powders up his hands and goes for sheila
theo and sheila get low and nasty on the tarmac
sheila turns and does the freak to theo rubbing her rear end into his crotch
as theo and sheila dance over near john he makes a throat slitting gesture across his neck
theos hands leave white prints on sheilas butt
the swing a delic funks so hard it causes spontaneous audience dance riots and structural damage in theaters across the country
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party theo
the ladies in akron call them thigh ticklers
can i ask you something personal
id rather you didnt
do you have a girlfriend
not while im in training
do you have a boyfriend
not at the present
sheila and theo toast marshmallows over the barbecue as the rest of the party dances in the background
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates
nobody in this town really understands junior
when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family
actually hes the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants
unfortunately what he wants is you
so what about you
do i want you
well get into that later
alone kastle stares at the bank of video monitors and runs a battery powered fuzzball remover around his collar
the monitors are deserted
miles absently pans a camera over and then sits bolt upright
on the screen he can see buzz fazeli in a room at babylon lanes surrounded by large piles of cash stuffing rolls of bills into hollow bowling pins
with rising anger why that filthy slimey double crossing misbegotten two faced mangy son of a bitch bastard
the motor in the fuzz ball remover shrieks as miles squeezes it to death
it shatters in his hands
theo and sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon
devil with the blue dress by shorty long plays on the stereo
the rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the distance
theo what would you do if you couldnt bowl
i dont know
its all i ever wanted to do
i wanted to be a motocross champion
my folks didnt really care what i did
then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope
most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats i got bowling
i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously
i hope im not insulting you
no im fascinated
why were you suspended
i used to be kind of wild
they used to call me the bad boy of bowling
so youre hoping buzz can get you re instated
well that was plan a
whats plan b
plan b is your dad
what do you think my dads gonna do for you
he said hed sponsor me
and what do you have to do for him
my dad doesnt do anything unless theres something in it for him
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days
be my body guard
she laughs heres my body theo
for my dads sake
for your career
sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt
come on theo what about plan c
looking worried whats plan c
opens her shirt showing off her brassiere is me
sheila takes theos nervous hands and places them inside her shirt
torn look sheila i really like you but
sheila rolls on top of him and plants a hickey on his neck
stopping her forget it sheila
kastle hurries through the darkened bowling alley
he stops short as a warning alarm begins to sound from somewhere deep within the building
lane six lights up and comes to life
kastle walks slowly forward
is that you junior
dont be afraid
where are you
i wont hurt you
kastle stealthily sneaks along beside row upon row of silent pin reset machines shining a flashlight in front of him
come on junior
everyones waiting for you son
the beam of light catches juniors face
he is crouched inside the machine at lane six
his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy
were having a party for you boy
cake and shish k bob just like you love
junior cringes away from the light
you made me hurt him
kastle reaches into his pocket and pulls a gaudy digital wristwatch from his pocket
look what i got for you
he holds the watch up in front of junior
junior looks curiously at the watch
happy birthday junior
the watch begins to play an electronic version of raindrops keep falling on my head
juniors face lights up
kastle begins luring junior out of machine number six with the watch
i have someone for you to play with junior
someone wants to play with me
i have someone for you to play blueface with junior
blueface is my favorite
breeze and sid speed down a road in their damaged hulk
the tenor of enrico caruso can be heard from inside
sid gazes out the window
enrico caruso wails from the car stereo
bowling used to be so pure so
breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct
la da da dalala
looking heatedly disturbed i hate fuckin opera
how could you hate opera sid
opera has all the drama and excitement of real life to music
how do you know you dont even speak latin
you listen to the feelings not the words
you got an track tape player on purpose just cause you knew the only thing they had on track was fuckin opera
it was a clearance
sid seems to calm down
wistfully you know elvis bowled
bowling was the most incorruptible sport
no megalomillionaires no more gambling
and it was a safe place for kids a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome clean fun
sympathetically sure sid
becoming rabid but not no more
now people take advantage
bowling aint what it used to be
theres something evil spreading in this sport like a big gigantic puss ridden getting excited canker sore
apoplectic right eating at the core eating its way out
it makes me sick
sid starts pressing buttons on the tape deck how do you turn this thing off
thats an aria
sid and breeze struggle for the cassette
the music distorts into a warbling gurgle of an aria
sid yanks the cassette out but the tape becomes tangled in the player
he pulls at the endless yards of tape and throws the whole mess out the window
theo wearing sunglasses and dressed in a jogging suit similar to miles kastles steps out of the diner with a bag containing four orange whips
he goes over to his parked car
buzz walks up
in deadly serious theo i want you to get out of this town
im getting to like it here
did that porcupine say hed get you back on the tour
i gotta survive
shaking his head hell be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life
you got a better offer
i didnt think so
theo takes a long drag from his orange whip
not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television
bitterly thats right buzz and you know when i did it
last match last frame
all i needed was one spare for the crown and i get stuck with the seven ten the fazeli split
you never even took the shot
you couldnt do it
theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner
repressed fury in his voice i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad
the moment passes
theo turns and climbs into his car
he looks up at buzz
look kid gimme a break
im an old man
taps chest im runnin on a delrin aorta
im finished dead from my ankles up
i couldnt care less
theo starts his car
you know what i think
you didnt come here to find a father
you didnt even come here for help
you just came here to take it all out on somebody
well it aint gonna be me
theo pulls out of the parking lot
buzz yells after him
at the top of his lungs the kastle home is a huge nouveau riche brady bunch style house with a large deck jutting over the driveway
the doors are open on the spacious two car garage
sheila has the headset of her vespa disassembled
theo walks up the driveway orange whips in hand
i dont think your new outfit suits you theo
flicking dust off the suit really
i kinda like it
he sits nearby
do you talk with your mom
its been awhile
she didnt want me looking for my dad
my mom told me not to stay in this town
so why do you stay
im a credit card junkie
i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out
now im trapped in his easy payment plan
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers
yeah but theyre all little wannabes
im looking for a professional man
he ponders the thought i may not be a pro bowler but im no amateur man
sheila moves closer to theo
touches his lips how much would you charge me for the lips
more than you could afford
come on bargain with me
i could let them go for ten
she pulls away slightly you professional men drive a hard bargain
im afraid i only have five on me
sheila pulls out a dollar bill
smiles if you want a professional man you have to be willing to pay for him
sheila and theo stand on the deck
sheila scans the road leading to the house with binoculars
what are you going to do about your brother
what about the guy he put in the body cast
the road is empty momentary relapse
except for that hes been making progress
theo nervously pulls his collar up over the hickey on his neck
junior is like a faithful doggy
he loves his birthday so much that every year before we can go pick him up
kastles car appears driving hell for leather towards the house
he breaks out of the hospital and comes home on his own
here they come
she hands the binoculars to theo who immediately trains them on the road
my mom once had an affair
when my dad found out he had junior kill the man
the body was never found but i think junior took him to the alley
theo lowers the binoculars and looks at sheila
then its true isnt it
kastles car comes belly flopping to a stop in front of the house
kastle climbs out and gesticulates wildly to the couple
a loud whisper hes here
come on down
muffled ok hats on everybody
sounds of the group gathering outside can be heard
muffled dad this is ridiculous
just open it
now real quiet
the lid flies up and kastle sheila and theo stand there with party hats and party horns in their mouths
they all cheer and throw confetti
kastle takes a flash snapshot
junior lying on some folded blankets in the trunk looks at his family with a stunned expression
he is in a straitjacket
juniors new watch begins to play raindrops keep falling on my head
he struggles to pull his arm out but cant
kastle reaches in to untie the straitjacket
steady boy steady
untied junior presses the beeping watch against his ear
his face breaks into a beatific smile
kastle pulls shish kebab chunks off a skewer
he looks down to see that one of the chunks is a melted ken head
he throws it away in disgust
i bet you didnt know that you and junior have something in common theo junior cant bowl anymore either
isnt that right junior
kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on juniors right hand
the table settings jump from the shock
junior sits impassively his face a blank
tell theo what happened to your hand junior
after we eat dad
he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid
crushed all the nerve endings
junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand
its not so bad
when im alone it feels like someone else
sheila grabs the bottle from junior opens it and pours some on her shish kebab
she leans over and whispers furiously to her father
do you have to get your hooks into every guy im interested in
whispers back defensively youre just like you mother
thats why mom ran away because you had to control everything
she ran away to be with that
spits out his words that motocross champion
your turn theo
why cant you bowl
sheila and kastle sit up
i dont like to talk about it
youre prone to violent outbursts arent you
it feels good to let it out doesnt it
sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father
youre using theo for your own deviant purposes
look whos talking
leave him alone
just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you doesnt mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business
i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that
snaps his fingers sheila and kastle sit up
junior how bout a riddle
turns to sheila sheila
sheila glances nervously at theo
impatiently come on sheila knock knock
jyou and your friend do it yet
laughs laughing fantastic
caustically you still got the touch junior
a bowling pin shaped cake with candles ablaze is presented to a seated junior
he is wearing a paper birthday hat
the four orange whips are arrayed around the table
make a wish son
junior stares into sheilas eyes for several seconds
same wish as last year
sheila blows out the candles in a hurry
it wont come true junior
kastle places a gift wrapped box in front of junior and lifts the lid
he reaches in and pulls out a huge intricate claw like arm shaped device made of plastic and metal and covered with cables
its a bowling claw
you can bowl now junior
with the whole family
junior beams at the group
puts one arm around junior and one on theo pretty soon everybody can bowl
the two sleazeballs walk up onto the deck and over to the table
nods to seated party junior long time
i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro shock
junior looks from one man to the other breathing heavily his nostrils flaring
interrupting dont do it breeze
to junior you aint getting us into that
kastle gets up
hey enough fun and games
we have work to do
come on junior
kastle heads for his car
junior gets up and follows
the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands
to theo if junior thinks youre doing the bouncy bouncy with his sister hes gonna tap dance on your spleen
pokes theo in the side pulls down theos collar to reveal the hickey with cleats
the two men turn laughing and follow kastle
kastle huddles with sid and breeze jr
stands nearby fiddling with his new bowling arm
buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins
sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other
i want you two to pick up buzz and bring him to lane six
junior will take it from there
perks up at mention of lane six im gonna play blue face
buzz checks if the coast is clear and then stuffs boxes of bowling pins into the trunk of his car
theo and kastle stand on the deck watching the sleazeballs put junior into the trunk of their car
kastle lights an oversized cigar and hands one to theo
champ as soon as you get back on the tour we should do an instructional videotape
rambowl theo skinner teaches power bowling
you on the cover with a flame thrower
kastle lights theos cigar and they puff away
theo how would you like to be my new partner
you already have a partner mr
sheila walks over as the sleazeballs car pulls out of the driveway
i think buzz is retiring soon
in fact i think hes retiring tonight
kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila
why dont you two go and do something fun tonight on me
sheila is lured to the scent of the plastic like a junkie to a fix
one thing stay away from the lanes
if junior sees you two together hell swallow his tongue
she reaches for the card and kastle snatches it away from her with a chortle
what did i say
dont go near the bowling alley
enunciating clearly bowling center
kastle hands her the card and heads into the house
it wouldnt bother you if buzz was in danger would it
nope i couldnt care less
im sure you wouldnt care if he needed your help right
why should i help that old fuck
sarcastically yeah what did buzz fazeli ever do for you
and besides its probably too late anyhow
exhaling cigar smoke way too late
buzz fazeli is history
goes to take another drag then stops too late for what
she turns away
too late for what sheila
you know how people with broken bones know when theres a storm coming
you got any broken bones
no but somethings gonna blow in this town
i can feel it
are you fucking with me sheila
is something gonna happen to buzz
sheila seems to be trying to tell theo but is unable
faltering i cant tell you theo
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv
theo takes sheila by the shoulders
gently tell me sheila
what are you afraid of
sheila shakes her head
im afraid youll hurt him
its junior isnt it
starting to cry i cant i cant do it
she looks up through her tears at theo hes my brother
hes my father
sid and breezes car sits in front of buzzs house
track opera plays on the car stereo
a man screams and glass smashes
shot running desperately through the house knocking things over smashing things
we hear buzz screaming in terror
the scream is cut off
with a thud the camera falls over and hits the floor
the golf ball rolls slowly into view and stops
footsteps recede a door slams and a car drives away
theo and sheila walk her vespa up to the darkened alley
theo is wearing his own clothes again
the sound of a lone bowler is heard
theo straps on his wristbrace
sheila pulls out keys
these open the back door
dont let him catch you behind the machines if he does youre trapped
ill meet you at the bridge
theo takes the keys
sheila grabs his arm
you dont have to do this
we could just cut out of here go to akron or anywhere else
dislodging her hand gently ill be at the bridge
theo snakes his way along the rows of pin machines towards the only light source lane six
as he leans in to peer through the machine a ball explodes into the pins
junior wearing his elaborate bowling claw is working himself into a sweaty froth
junior picks up his ball and sends it crashing into the pins
stops and looks around whos there
theo remains silent
getting angry whos there
i say knock knock
you say whos there
i say whos there and then you say who who
youre not playing right
primly knock knock
junior walks towards theo
theo remains silent
boiling youre supposed to say junior who
im going to have to hurt you
theo and junior circle one another
you shouldnt touch her
no junior you shouldnt touch her
nobody touches her
i touch her
sheila told me you played bouncy bouncy with her
what did your dad tell you to do to buzz
theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees
junior catches him grabbing his ankles
he told me to play blue face with buzz
i like games
struggling to get away what did you do to buzz
you played bouncy bouncy with sheila so im gonna play blue face with you
he grabs theos throat hoarsely i dont want to play
theo stretches to get a nearby ball but just cant reach it by millimeters
to play i press my fingers on a throat like this
he presses tighter on theos windpipe and then the mans face would go blue and i should keep pressing
theos face goes pale blue and i did and then he stopped moving and he didnt play anymore after that
theo bends back a finger on juniors hand
junior lets out a howl of pain and releases theos neck
theo gasps for air
you didnt play fair
stands up you were almost blue
theo gets his fingers in a bowling ball and brings it up to bash junior in the head
go ahead theo i saw you on tv
im your biggest fan
junior offers theo his unprotected head
yelling come on theo give me your autograph
theo bashes junior in the head with the ball
it bounces off juniors head like a nerf ball and rolls down the alley
thank you mr
theo desperately but fruitlessly tries to get away
as he crawls over the ball return trough junior puts his foot on theos head
i can have her you know
looks around and whispers shes not my real sister
he flashes a lecherous smile theos pov a ball pops up at the far end of the return and trundles rapidly towards theo
the ball hits theos face with a pow
black out we hear raindrops keep falling on my head
theos bowling shoe attired feet being dragged down the lane
theo comes to and looks down his body to see the empty lane
he looks up to see junior pulling him towards the pin reset machine
the cut on theos forehead bleeds down the side of his face
junior pulls the dazed theo into the pin reset machine and positions him under the pins
as junior prepares the machinery a control cable on his claw becomes fouled
junior begins to thrash about as he tries to disentangle himself and his malfunctioning arm
theo rolls away as juniors flailing releases the machine
it comes slamming down on junior just as theo slips out of harms way
he gets up and staggers away from the machine
juniors howl echoes across the lanes
his twitching feet protrude from the maw of the device
lane six goes dark
theo limps up the lane
theo drives up to the erect draw bridge
he stops and gets out
the night is silent
loud whisper sheila
where are you
sheila pops out of the bushes and walks towards theo
angry you told junior that we did it
he tried to squeeze my fucking head off
what did you say to him
when they reach each other they stop
sheila seems to weigh her answer
i told him you were my boyfriend
very pissed off what the hell did you go doing that for sheila
we havent even gotten naked yet
we would have sooner or later
he tried to kill me
you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you
did you kill him
theo paces up and down in front of the upright bridge
how do you get this thing down
tell me what happened theo
theo backs sheila towards the bridge control booth
glares at sheila you wanted me to kill him didnt you
in shock if hes not dead hell keep coming back
hes dead sheila
i feel sick
are you sure hes dead
i didnt stop to take his pulse
theo boosts sheila up the ladder to the control booth
the hydraulic machinery of the bridge heaves into motion and the bridge begins to lower
theo walks over to his car
sheila jumps down from the bridge control booth and follows him
where are you going
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz
he gets into his car
can i come with you
i did your dirty work for you sheila now fuck off
theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone
she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression then turns on her heel
theo grips the steering wheel with white knuckles
he nods off at the wheel the roadway through his eyes wavering and distorting
he hits himself in the face in an effort to keep himself awake
the house is dark except for a light coming from the closed bathroom door
theo cautiously makes his way to the door
water is running inside
theo twists the doorknob and opens the door with a jolt
junior lunges out of the dark mangled and bloody with bowling pins sticking out of his chest
dont you knock
theo slams the door shut
theo jerks awake
his car is parked by the fazeli house
it is a clear blustery day
a gust of wind pulls the screen door open then slams it shut
he gets out of the car and walks unsteadily towards the house
theo walks into the house
the place is completely trashed
theo picks up a golf ball from the floor
he makes his way to the bathroom door and slowly turns the knob then pulls back
he picks up a nearby bowling ball and holds it over his head as he reaches for the doorknob
this time he thrusts the door open
the bathroom is empty
relieved he cradles the ball in his arms
thick crimson red fluid trickles down his forearm dripping off his elbow
horrified he pulls his fingers out of the ball
blood streams out of the three finger holes
he drops the ball to the floor
he goes into the bathroom and turns on the sink faucets
water runs as theo manically washes the blood from his hands and arms
he rinses the blood from the holes of his ball and looks up to the mirror
nok nok is smeared in blood across his reflection
theo waits through several rings
where are you
are you alright
i found dad
hes dead isnt he
pauses buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born
mom you know i had to do it
i just did it a little too late
you sure youre ok teddy
youre not bowling are you
i gotta go
love ya mom
theo hangs up the phone
alfie shuffles over
did you hear about that bowler who got smeared
i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley
i heard he was kacked but good
they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out
stunned the pin machine
just like junior did the last time lane six
alls i know is its gonna be a closed coffin
my advice to you is to lay low
he puts on a pair of dark eleven shades flips up his collar and skulks away
theo pulls into the parking lot
the place is cordoned off with day glo yellow emergency tape printed with bowling police do not cross
a black bowling police van its blue light spinning is parked in front
bowling cops herd dwarfs and customers into the van
mothers and daughters mill around behind the yellow tape
a group of little people brandish right to work signs
theo gets out of his car
the crowd moves in as kastle hands cuffed behind him emerges from the door
there he is
camera flashes pop all over the place
two black jacketed bowling cops step out behind him
they are sid and breeze
bowling police step back give him room
nothing going on here everybody stand back
let him through ladies
as they start to move through the female throng a little girl pops out in front of them holding her ball
kastle we know you wouldnt do anything bad
thank you sweetheart
turns to breeze see that you pinheads
with sweeping head gesture theyre all character witnesses
he sees theo thanks to buzz fazeli bowling is dead in this town
he killed it
the two officers hustle kastle towards the van
theo steps out in front of him
between clenched teeth you fool we could have done great things together
he killed your stoolie embezzler father and hes gonna kill you next
sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowds murmur increases
kastle turns and yells over his shoulder
shouting lock your daughters up ladies
juniors out there
mothers and daughters send out a cacophony of screams and scatter for their cars
the bp cops hoist kastle into the back of the van
sid slams the doors shut
the van screeches off sirens wailing
sid and breeze walk up to theo
sorry about your loss
shaking his head i shouldve pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one
you should probably hit the road
this place could get hazardous for your health
so buzz was stooling for you guys
you call it stooling we call it cooperating
breeze looks under theos car
did you know you were parked in the handicap space
kastles daughters been lookin for you
theo gets into his car and starts the engine
sid and breeze poke their heads in the windows
she told us you went after junior to save your old mans hide
you got some balls goin after that psycho
only problem is you didnt put his lights out you just got him mad
then he took it out on poor faz god rest his soul
theo patches out
think he bought it
id buy it
sid chews his lip worriedly
theo nods off for a second and then snaps back
his eyes seem hypnotized by the lines on the road which seem to swim and undulate unnaturally
he nods again
and snaps again
theo pulls up to the old party spot and gets out
he walks over the dunes and towards the beached station wagon
a huge flame rises down the beach
a woman is visible in its light tossing objects into the fire
theo walks towards her
sheila is stripping barbie and ken dolls and tossing them onto the pyre
each one goes up in an exaggerated whoosh of flames
she notices theo when he steps into the light
once my father walked in on me while i was making barbie and ken do it
i was seven
he took all my dolls away from me and cut them in half
he gave the top halves back to more me
then he made me watch him burn the bottom halves in the fireplace
theo kneels down nearby and throws a barbie onto the bonfire
it goes up with a i can see juniors face in the fire
theo puts his hand on sheilas hand
she looks at him
why did you come back
when im with you sheila i dont even think about bowling
theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately
she stops him and looks around nervously
if junior finds us hell kill us both
i killed him once ill just have to kill him again
you dont get two chances with junior
at least ill die smiling
sheila pushes him over
he falls backwards her on top
and you only get two chances with me
sheila yanks her shirt over her head and tosses it away
the shirt crackles and burns
she pulls theos head up to her breasts
whats it gonna be theo
a barbies breasts blister from the heat
theo bends sheila backwards down on her back
she grabs the tail of his shirt yanks it over his head and off his body
sheila rubs her hands up theos back
whats the plan theo
a ken back bubbles and melts
theo lifts sheilas back off the sand and works her jeans down her legs
say something theo
give me something
a dolls legs catch fire
theo stares into sheilas eyes
from now on its gonna be plan c
both bodies throb and grind their sandy hands sliding over each others sweaty skin
its gonna be you sheila
they humpty hump to the beat of scientists dematerialize
we hear theo and sheilas stereophonic moaning as a barbie and a ken doll collapse and vaporize from the blazing heat
we pan up through the flames the moans increasing in volume and intensity as they reach the you know what weve all been waiting for
a coffin moves slowly forward as a solemn dirge plays
the top is in the shape of a bowling alley with a miniature black bowling ball inscribed with the faz at the head
the pallbearers theo breeze sid tina and two other bowlers place the coffin on poles above the grave
a rotund priest sprinkles holy water
sheila stands next to theo crying
more theo wears a glazed look
the priest clears his throat with a loud ahem
with pomp and vigor bowling
pauses to reflect bowling is a little like faith
every now and then we are blessed with the ability and strength to send a full roller down
makes bowling gesture and scatter those babies like nobodys business
and every now and then we end up in the gutter
pauses and gets glum buzz fazeli found himself in the gutter of life
trapped in hook alley throwing nothing balls
but before he left us for that pie alley in the clouds he pulled himself out of that gutter
buzz fazeli died cleaning up the sport of bowling
now he lies at peace alongside his lane brothers here in bowlers field
makes sign of the cross he died so that we could bowl with dignity
millie decked out in mourning black lets out a wail steps up and throws a bouquet of flowers onto the coffin
sniffles i forgive you buzz
sid leans over to theo
in loud whisper the faz sure took care a her
points to millie does the cash rub with fingers breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger
sid trying to keep a straight face elbows him
sid and breeze approach the coffin
breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid
nectar of the bowling gods faz
see ya round faz
tina steps up to the grave with a handful of papers
these are all your perfect games
she drops scoresheets onto the coffin bowl with god buzz
mourners sniff and cry
the coffin starts descending into the ground
a stiff breeze scatters the scoresheets
sheila nudges theo who approaches and tosses a handful of soil into the grave
maybe you were right buzz
maybe i did just come here to take it out on somebody
but i had to find my father
the muffled beeping of raindrops keep falling on my head begins playing from inside the coffin
theos body jolts
he runs after sheila who is walking towards her scooter
buzz is alive sheila
the two sleazeballs gaze surreptitiously at him as they walk towards their car
theo grabs sheilas jacket
theo buzz is dead
i didnt come this far to bury a guy thats not my dad
he owes me
bitterly back to plan a
the vicious cycle all over again
theo lets go of sheila
ive been trapped by miles kastle my whole life
she walks over to her scooter and mounts it
now hes the one whos locked up and im the one whos free
if i gotta do this alone i might as well start now
she revs up and peals out
yells as sid and breeze walk up to their car theo catches up with them
why is juniors watch in that coffin
something stinks around here
your time is up busyboy
who identified the body
the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality
im the next of kin
i shouldve seen him
after we id we bury the body
case and casket closed
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place
juniors underground in that coffin you dicks put him in
its splitsville for you
sid and breeze back away from theo
you faked my dads murder
you used him
where is he
theo chases sid and breeze around their car
he catches sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand
doc said id be back on the planks in a week
show him breeze
breeze pulls a copy of new york bowler from his pocket
the headline reads rub kingpin with a photo of buzz fazeli
its official youre an orphan
happy now busyboy
theo stares at the newspaper
he lets sids fingers drop
sheila speeds along her vespa maxing out at mph
from behind her we see theos car approaching rapidly
he pulls up beside her
shouting and pointing frantically what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum
who said anything about an ultimatum
you want to find your father
get a shovel and start digging
hurry up hes probably in purgatory by now
sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo
he moves up beside her again
youre really pissing me off
im pissing you off
im doing what i said id do
what the hell are you doing
what about your word
my word is good and itll always be good
when did i ever give my word to you
what about plan c
fuck plan c
your word is so good youre never gonna give it to anyone
you think im dumping you to get back into bowling
well whos dumping who
im not dumping you im suspending you
suck my dick
she speeds ahead
theo thunders along in his car
he listens to his song over the stereo
theo digs into his pocket and pulls out the golf ball from buzzs house
the logo on the ball reads paradise
the white ball fills the frame
whispers to himself paradise
hmmmm the camera pulls back from the ball to reveal theo standing in flowery long bermuda shorts matching airbrush luau shirt and shades
the woman behind the counter looks like alfies twin
its actually alfie in drag
its the same store as before only with a tropical motif
instead of bowling magazines on the rack theres mini golf digest
alfreda examines the ball at arms length through her bifocals
you a mini golfer
might be one of the new putt putts off route
theo turns to leave
can i get you something for the road
you have orange whips
not from round here are ya
im from akron
the billboard fills the frame
it reads paradise putt putt and underneath a heavenly experience
a motorized cheesy looking smiling dwarf angel swings a golden club
miniature golf obstacles are bathed in the light of the setting sun
the camera passes a huge cement centaur surrounded by astro carpeting
i just hold it loosely with both hands
thats right sugar find the grip thats right for you
then grasp firmly
the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini green
line up where you want it
now swing it out a little to the right
no no thats too far
try a more gentle stroke
its all in the stroke
go ahead now honey stroke
as the camera comes around the side of the whale we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish
his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it
here goes nothin
she swings a club sending a golf ball puttering into a cup
hole in one
youre the queen of stroke
theo strides towards the couple
the man under the halo is more buzz
he raises the club at the approaching theo keeping the woman in front of him as a shield
the front of buzzs cap reads im no angel
get away from me
who the hell are you
you said you was single
we aint married no more
he says that to all his wives
as she tries to wiggle away from him the club conks buzz on the noodle squishing his halo
freeing herself to buzz geez maynard is he telling the truth
dont pay him any mind sweetheart
youre a nice guy maynard but if you got two wives i aint into no polybigamy
buzz is silent
he takes the club out of her hand
she steps away startled then turns and jogs away
buzz throws down his club in a fury
i was just about to make a love connection
you sure got a way with women
you show up women get away
laughs the whole world thinks youre underground
i am underground
buzz removes his damaged cap
it could just as easily have been me in that box
i told you to get lost
you forced yourself into this mess so the mess accommodated you
buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo
what about bowling
takes a practice swing bowling died for me years ago
besides im a living dead legend
im a hero
youre a scumbag
buzz pats his hair down and slips the cap back on his head
im a live scumbag
theo digs into his pocket and retrieves the golf ball
he tosses it to buzz
nice knowing you dad
theo turns and walks towards his car
buzz pauses and walks after him
so eh you never saw me
i never saw you
pause where are you goin now
im goin straight
no more short cuts
theo gets into the car
buzz leans in the open window
listen if straight doesnt work out you come work for me
hands theo his card just make sure nobodys following you
buzzs face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset his halo bouncing in the breeze
i didnt mean that stuff i said
i was trying to keep you out of this muddle
im glad i didnt have my tubes tied
oh and by the way i made a call for you before i uh retired
buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen
hands the card back you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call
taps the card tell him your maynards boy
hes expecting you and he owes me
hell getcha back in like flynn
pats theos cheek dont say i never gave you nothing
cracks a half smile see ya round maynard
buzz backs away from the car as theo peels out in reverse
buzz stands and watches as theo pulls away
the sign has been changed to sheilas alley
a sparkling new badass super chromed vespa is parked in the handicap zone
the barbie and ken dolls are wired to the headlamp
they look incredibly worse for the wear
a parking ticket is nestled between them
theos car pulls in nearby
theo walks through the doors and into the alley packed with serious bowling types
as he walks towards the back of the alley several bowlers stop bowling and stare at him in awe
theo walks on
others greet the conquering hero
hey theos back
hello there stranger
still crying waaaaaaaaaaah
at the far end we see sheila dressed in a fitted jogging suit bowling alone on her lane
bowlers stop and hold their balls at their sides
sheila notices the whole alley is silent
theo steps up to the lane bowling ball bag in hand
as he straps on his wristbrace he peers down the lane and sees a seven ten split mule ears
a loud zip and light spills in through three holes
three fingers approach the holes blocking out the light once more
with a pop the fingers leave the holes and the ball hits the lane with a klunk
the camera races towards the pins along the maple boards
two pins loom in the foreground one at each edge of the screen
the ball slams into the right hand pin in super slow motion with a roar
theos eyes slowly close
the pin lifts and hurtles slowly across the frame towards its unsuspecting fellow pin
theos eyes open
with a reverberating explosion the pin is taken out
theo turns to sheila and takes her in his arms
i am a professional man
touches his lips lips still for sale
nonchalantly you bet
for five bucks ill even throw in the tongue
she pulls away slightly can you change something this big
she pulls out a hundred dollar bill
i dont know
sheila stuffs the bill down theos pants
youll owe me
they smooch big time
one by one balls drop to the lanes again and pins start crashing
alfie hands trembling lays a tiny wreath on buzz fazelis grave
the headstone reads maynard buzz fazeli i never met a bowler i didnt like
a muffled watch beeper chimes raindrops keep falling on my head
the camera pulls up to show ten headstones laid out in a bowling pin set up with buzzs at the head
buzzs silhouette against an orange sunburst sky
he wears his halo hat
he takes a beautiful pga perfect slow motion fluid golf swing connecting with a thwap
as he follows through divots of turf dance at his feet
he holds the afterswing pose and gazes after the ball off into the distance
