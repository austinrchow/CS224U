fire walk with me teresa banks and the last seven days of laura palmer screenplay by david lynch and bob engels typed by deep thought lynch frost productions shooting draft
on screen it reads teresa banks body wrapped in plastic floating through hells canyon drifting along in wind river
on screen it reads establish
gordon cole talks on the speaker phone
a school bus
two very buxom prostitutes are being handcuffed by a plain clothes special agent chester desmond
another agent has his gun to the spread eagled bus drivers head
the kids inside the bus are screaming
the phone inside chester desmonds car starts to ring
desmond walks to the car
desmond picks up the ringing phone
little louder ok gordon
very loud okay gordon
desmond electronically lowers the aerial adjusting the volume
smell something fishy huh
small government plane lands
desmond exits the plane
cole and another man sam stanley walk towards him
motioning to the man standing there desmond and stanley shake
its a pleasure
ive heard a lot about you
i heard about that
plowing ahead lil walks to them from another room
she goes into a contorted dance
things we notice
she makes a sour face
she walks in place
she puts one hand in her pocket and makes a fist with the other
while she is doing this she blinks with both eyes
she is wearing a red wig
at one point during this cole adds a sentence
cole holds four fingers in front of his eyes
noticing the fingers federal
cole gives him the thumbs up
lil finishes her dance
turns to sam back to chet right gordon
well be in touch
desmonds car on the highway
as they barrel down the highway that was really something
that dancing girl
after a beat what did it mean
if you work with gordon you learn that right away
code ive heard a lot about this
desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out of his sleeve
sort of shorthand
missing the humor shorthand
were heading into a difficult situation
how do you figure
ill explain it to you
do you remember lils dance
as desmond explains we in slow motion
lil was wearing a sour face
what do you mean
her face had a sour look
that means were going to have trouble with the local authorities
they are not going to be receptive to the fbi
both eyes blinking means there is going to be trouble higher up
the eyes of the local authority
a sheriff and a deputy
that would be my guess
two of the local law enforcers are going to be a problem
desmond continued if you noticed she had one hand in her pocket which means they are hiding something and the other hand made a fist which means they are going
to be belligerent
desmond continued lil was walking in place which means theres going to be a lot of legwork involved
desmond continued cole said lil was his mothers sisters girl
what is missing in that sentence
oh the uncle is missing
not coles uncle but probably the sheriffs uncle in federal prison
so the sheriff had got an uncle whos committed a serious crime
right which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation
let me ask you something stanley did you notice anything about the dress
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her
i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in
it wasnt her dress or she must have lost some weight
gordon said you were good
the tailored dress is our code for drugs
did you notice what was pinned to it
a blue rose
very good but i cant tell you about that
stanley rides along quietly for a while
what did gordons tie mean
thats just gordons bad taste
why couldnt he have just told you all these things
he talks loud
and he loves his code
he does talk loud
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation
it must be a high priority situation
desmonds car drives off
desmond and stanley arrive
the sheriffs station is in a sorry state outside
they walk up to the old steps and enter
agent desmond and stanley walk into a very small reception area
at the counter desmond shows his badge to cliff howard the deputy
good afternoon federal bureau of investigation special agent chet desmond
id like to see sheriff cable
cliff just smiles for a long minute
why dont you folks have a seat
make yourself at home
its gonna be a while
desmond stays standing and stanley sits
after another long moment cliff joins the secretary in a conspiratorial giggle over the long wait they are planning to give the fbi
in the middle of a giggle cliff smiles up at desmond
cliff continued why dont you have some of that coffee
it was fresh two days ago
cliff has a good laugh over this and leans again over the secretary pretending to look at some paper work
they both laugh
okay thats it
ive had enough of the waiting room now
still smiling oh
desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to sheriff cables office
cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway daring him to do something
while they stare eye to eye desmonds hand goes up slowly towards cliffs face in a slow mesmerizing way
cliff tries to knock chets hand away
chet counters by grabbing cliffs nose and pinches a nerve to its side injecting cliff with a great amount of pain
cliff continued desmond spins the deputy degrees placing himself on the inside of the office and then still pressing the nerve guides cliff down into a chair
while the deputys eyes tear copiously desmond turns to the secretary
you can start that fresh pot of coffee right now
desmond stalks to sheriff cables office
stanley remains behind continuing to observe every detail
sheriff cable looks up from his work
how the hell did you
desmond shows his credentials
federal bureau of investigation special agent chet desmond
cliff still holding his nose appears just behind desmond who turns to him
desmond continued thats all right deputy sheriff cable can take it from here cable signals cliff to leave
desmond continued im here to investigate the murder of teresa banks
well little fella we dont need any outside help here
i dont like you people sniffin around my neck of the woods
in fact when the state boys called me about a j
edgar coming up i think i said so what
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government
youre lucky i am not wasting you
well little fella let me put it this way
the operative word here would be federal
with or without the semantics of all this i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks both while living and deceased
cable retrieves a box with the paper work and some personal effects
he throws it to desmond
a basic kill
banks was a drifter and nobody knew her
my boys have been all over this
its a dead end
thats why were here sheriff cable
wheres the body
out back in our morgue desmond starts to leave
cable continued its
we close at five
weve got our own clock
well lock up
as desmond turns to leave he notices on the wall a framed newspaper clipping with picture
the caption reads the newspaper shows a picture of cable in a he man pose bending a steel bar into a u shape
he turns to leave and stanley seems to have appeared right on time
desmond moves down the hall and stanley follows
as desmond and stanley walk to the adjoining morgue they see a pile of steel bars similar to the one they saw cable bending in the picture
stanley moves up to desmond and speaks confidentially
you know agent desmond i figure this whole office furniture included is worth dollars
desmond doesnt know what to say to him
they enter the morgue
teresas body is on the platform in the middle of the room stanley hangs his recorder on the hooks at the end of the autopsy table and puts on rubber
desmond opens teresa banks file
reading teresa banks lived at the canyon trailer park for a month
well check that
and worked as a waitress at haps truck stop
worked the night shift
good place for dinner when were thru here sam
flips to another page no one came to claim the body and no known next of kin
as desmond is doing this stanley takes out his special machine
desmond looks up from his work and notices
solved the whiteman case with this
thats what i heard
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this
and no one had a machine like this
yes it is good
looks around what do you think is in these other drawers
i dont know sam
maybe later we could take a look
sure but lets finish up with this first
getting to work stanleys face goes right over teresas
into his recorder crushed skull
probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object
subject looks to be between and years of age
cole said she was
stanleys eyes drift to teresas left hand
i wonder where her ring is
desmond notices the mark on her hand as well
looking into the personal effects personal effects include a watch under garments and a blue waitress uniform
the ring is missing
it says the rest of her things havent been removed yet from the trailer
lets hope its there
stanley picks up her left hand
in stanleys hand
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand
stanley peers underneath the fingernail
stanley brings over his whiteman instrument
works the left hand under it
agent desmond would you hold the finger for me
theres something up there
he gets whatever it is with a long set of tweezers
what is it
it is a piece of paper with the letter t imprinted on it
take a look
desmond comes around and takes a look
on a piece of paper
pondering what he has seen
we move across to a clock on the wall that reads
it now reads
stanley zips up a regulation body bag around teresa
desmond and stanley come out of the morgue
geez agent desmond its three thirty in the morning
where are we going to sleep
you and i are going to get some food
yes its been several hours since weve eaten
i didnt realize that so much time had past did you agent desmond
desmond takes a long look at stanley
stanley continued youve got your own m
dont you agent desmond
desmond gets in and starts the car
desmond and stanley talk with jack the manager who has black wavy hair with a black full mustache to match shiny silk shirt with silver strands sown in and an
indian turquoise belt
he has a sign on his shirt that says say goodbye to jack
a guy in the room is working on a light that keeps buzzing and shorting out
he doesnt really know what hes doing so he is poking at the wiring
had the fbi here once before
back in the fifties when hap was running the place
hes dead good and dead
sorry to hear it
he didnt suffer
id like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks sheriff cables already asked me a few questions about teresa banks
she worked nights for a month
ever see her with someone else
did she ever mention any friends
pointing ask irene over there
he gestures thru a door that leads out to the diner pointing out a woman behind the counter
jack continued now her name is irene and it is night
dont take it any further than that
theres nothin good about it
they sit at the counter and irene comes over to them
behind her is the coffee and she is working on a cigarette
lipstick smeared on the coffee cup
take a good look around
theres nobody in this place youre meetin the reason why
whatll it be
how come jack lets you work here
jack and i are united in holy matrimony
say no more
stanley is casing the restaurant as irene pours them a couple of cups of coffee
showing credentials federal bureau of investigation special agent chet desmond
id like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
jack said you knew her
she only worked here a month
never seemed to get here on time though
ask me she had a little problem with she makes a sniff to indicate a cocaine problem
irene continued came looking for a job with a friend of hers
couldve been her sister
what happened to her
there was only one job
teresa took the job
her friend took a hike
never saw her again
did you ever see teresa take cocaine
do you take cocaine irene
no i do not
i never took cocaine or any other drugs
i dont take drugs
nicotine is a drug
caffeine is a drug
those drugs are legal
hes with me
back on the track anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out
ive thought about that
i think her death is what you would call a freak accident
an old guy long and skinny smoking gets desmonds attention
you talking about that little girl that was murdered
you have something to tell us
i can tell shit from shinolah
gets me along way down that road
desmond moves away from him
you think we ought to question him
desmond looks down at the coffee cup in stanleys left hand
what time is it stanley
stanley checks his watch pouring hot coffee on himself
desmond guides his laugh into a cough
looking at his watch while his legs burn agent desmond its
its late sam
to himself as be dabs his pants with napkins its not late its early
irene comes up to them with her purse in her hand
she is going off duty
you know i never told anybody but once for about three days just before her time teresas arm went completely dead
what do you mean
her left arm
it was numb
she said she couldnt use it
said it had no feeling
probably from the drugs she was taking
after a beat i just thought i ought to tell you
stanley watches her leave
i doubt it was drugs more likely a problem with a nerve
i could recheck the arm for injuries but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland
i think thats a good idea
as desmond and stanley head towards their car
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park
are you speaking to me in a code
no sam im speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say
in that case we should go to the canyon trailer park
irene walks past them and towards the parking lot
catch themselves good morning
thank god it is morning
desmond and stanley drive thru to the managers trailer which is surrounded by a small white picket fence
they park and step to the trailer
desmond knocks twice on the door
from inside they hear a voice that makes coles voice sound like a whisper
just then desmond and stanley notice a sign on the door that reads
nines really late
we are really early
they both fumble for their badges as they hear the manager coming closer to the door
they meet the manager carl rodd
god damn this better be important
he stops in the middle of this when he sees the badges
federal bureau of investigation special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley
sorry to disturb you but we would like to see teresa banks trailer please
more popular than uncles day at a whorehouse
takes one step out of his trailer carl steps thru the little picket fences gate and leads them towards teresas trailer
carl continued mrs
simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town
teresa rented it about a month ago
did she have someone with her
she had a friend with her
the friend took off
was there an argument
not that i know of
but arguments do happen dont they
yes they do
did she have visitors
no hey i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff not quite able
heres the trailer now
he swings open the door
carl continued and this is exactly the way she left it
i never touched a god damn thing
frustration rising desmond and stanley go in
desmond smells the room
he and stanley look around
stanley leans over to desmond
whispers she lived alone
she must have known someone
desmond notices her personal effects on the dresser but no ring
desmond continued you better dust this place sam
ill get my kit
stanley walks towards the car
he writes in his note book
to himself dollars
desmond notices a picture hanging on the wall
takes the picture down and looks at it thru his magnifying glass
more teresa banks is wearing a ring
stanley returns with his equipment
desmond shows him the photograph
take a look at this
shes wearing a ring
stanley studies it
my guess is there isnt enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring but we should do a blowup of this anyway
squinting at the picture may i see the magnifying glass agent desmond
takes a look then looks at desmond there doesnt seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring
carl leans in from the outside
im gonna make myself some good morning america
you want some
both nod yes
stanley is finishing up his work
carl brings them their coffee
desmond tastes the coffee under sams watchful eye
you werent kiddin
this stuffs got the sting of the forty eight hour blend
thats the best coffee youre gonna get around here
watching desmond drink we really do need a good wake me up dont we agent desmond
after a long look from desmond we really do need a good wake me up dont we agent desmond
a woman sticks her head into the trailer
she has an ice pack over one eye and a load of idle curiosity
desmond notices her
did you know teresa banks
she just nods in the negative and leans back out
behind her is deputy cliff who looks into the trailer
hey hows j
to carl bet you appreciate them bustin your mornin in half eh carl
bet they woke you up
theyre only doing their job
what are you doing here in the trailer court deputy
maybe i just live here what do you think about that
can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered
you can tell j
edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin witnesses
maybe if you did a little less partyin that little girl would still be alive
is that right mr
did you know teresa banks
got a couple of cups of coffee at haps from her
by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman
i could ask you the same question
no you couldnt
chet steps towards cliff who looses his balance and has to step off the trailer steps
desmond stands in the doorway of the trailer and watches cliff get into his car and drive to work
stepping away from the trailer desmond spots something underneath
he bends down and retrieves a titleist golf ball
is there a golf course around here
not a lot around here no
got some clubs but not very many fellas with balls
desmond drops the ball in a plastic bag and gives it to stanley who puts it in his kit
desmond turns to carl
thanks for your help carl
sorry we woke you up
i was having a bad dream
i was dreamin about a joke with no punchline
desmond and stanley nod to carl and walk to their car
i couldnt help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer
you did think that didnt you agent desmond
hes not the murderer
after a beat but hes a bozo
yes he is like a clown
desmond walks around the car to the drivers side and gets in
the fbi mobile crime van sits outside as desmond and stanley pull up
cable and cliff meet desmond and stanley as they come in the door
the crime van driver sits nearby
the secretary is behind her desk
what the hell is that thing doing out there
youre not taking that body anywhere
were taking the body back to portland and theres not a thing you can do about it
maybe not a thing but maybe two things
teresa banks had a ring
any idea what happened to it
we got a phone here thats got a little ring
turning to stanley sam get the body and put it in the van
to cable sheriff cable where were you the night teresa banks was murdered
flexing the muscles in his arm my alibi is as strong as these bands of steel
he reaches out and stops stanley from going out to get the body
cable smiles menacingly at desmond
cable continued cliff told me you asked him the same thing
why dont we step around back and well have our final discussion out doors
cable exits followed by cliff and the giggling secretary
coming close to desmond when he says discussion how do you take that agent desmond
i dont take it sam
i give it
desmond cliff stanley cable the secretary and the fbi van driver all have stepped outside by the pile of iron bars
edgar im going to take off my badge here
do you mind
takes his badge off the only way youre going to get that body is over mine
he picks up a steel bar and bends it ala the picture in his office
to desmond you try that you little monkey
i think ill take off my badge as well
desmond takes his coat and badge off
cable takes his shirt off and desmond follows
cable is bare chested and desmond is in fbi issue underwear
desmond goes to pick up an iron bar and cable hits him with a sucker punch
as desmond bends away from this cable rushes at him
desmond stops him with a few well placed punches to his face
cable falls down and desmond stands over him
chet picks up the steel bar and bends it
he then tosses the bar away
cable stands up and rushes at desmond who flips and flops him around
cable tries one more grand roadhouse punch which desmond expertly ducks
eyeing cables glass jaw this ones comin from j
desmond blasts him in the jaw and cable goes over lights out all systems down
the no longer giggling secretary and cliff stand and stare
desmond looks at them
after a moment of unbearable humiliation they shuffle away
stanley and the driver finish loading the body into the van
desmond and stanley talk
take the van back to portland stanley
im going to take one more look at the trailer park
they walk towards the van until stanley stops
confidentially one thing that has been troubling me
that lamp at the diner
do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring
esthetics are subjective arent they agent desmond
extends his hand im sam stanley
if you ever need me
thanks sam for the good work
you have a good eye for detail
we do notice things dont we agent desmond
are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose
desmond smiles at stanley as they shake
as he enters the van desmond can barely make out what stanley says as he points to the driver
very muffled dollars
desmond is standing in front of teresas trailer with carl rodd
motioning behind and to the right of teresas trailer and thats deputy cliffs trailer over there
the red one
ill be in my trailer if you need me
carl walks away towards his trailer
desmond walks over and around cliffs red trailer
he gets a strange feeling
he looks past teresas trailer to the edge of the trailer park where he sees a hand appear in the window of a trailer
then the hand disappears
desmond walks to that trailer
he knocks on the door but no one answers
he looks under the trailer and sees a mound of dirt with a small indentation at the top
in the indentation is teresa banks ring
as he reaches out and touches it he disappears
cole and albert rosenfield talk
six to eight hands clapping
i was referring to the possibility of a little silence
the phone rings and cole answers it
agent dale cooper in the doorway across the hall talks to diane in the next room
while he talks he does some isometrics against the door frame
i know you havent changed your hair and ive seen that beautiful dress before but i must say diane you look sensational today
diane says something else that we cannot hear
enjoying this no i am not trying to buy time
its thursday and i know you have changed something in the room
and this time youve done very well
stalling and i am going to tell you exactly what it is
in a moment
you have moved
snaps his fingers got it
its the clock youve moved it inches to the left
a laugh another triumph for the dashing agent cooper
and you diane now have to clean the coffee cup get fresh ground coffee from sally and make a damn great pot of coffee
cooper with a triumphant smile walks over to join cole and albert
but coles stern look takes his smile away
what is it gordon
all around the walls of stanleys apartment are work benches with adding machinery sitting on top of them
in the middle of the room is a portable plastic pool with milky white water and crystallized salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks
from one odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend into the pool
coopers eyes go to the pool and back to stanley as sam talks about desmond
agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time
he had me drive the van with the body back here
which we did
it was miles
did gordon show you a woman named lil
im up to speed stanley
agent chet wouldnt tell me what the blue rose meant
and neither will i
understanding oh alright
reflecting you know i liked agent desmond
he had his own m
stanley turns to one of his work tables and shows cooper the whiteman machine
i cracked the whiteman case with this
trying to stop him stanley i heard all about it
no one couldve found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this
tell me about the letter
take a look at this
chet and i found it under teresa banks ring fingernail
cooper looks under the microscope to see the letter they found on teresa
and no one found the ring
no sir we did not
cooper straightens up from the microscope
stanley extends his hand
im sam stanley if you ever need me
carl rodd shows cooper to teresas trailer
im beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system
dont you folks talk to one another
thats her trailer there and i havent touched a god damn thing
agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howards trailer gestures to the red trailer which i showed him
i went back to my trailer
gestures back to his after that i never saw him again
thank you carl
cooper starts walking in the opposite direction from cliffs trailer picking up on the same odd vibe that struck desmond
turning back thats not the way to cliffs trailer
i told you
i am not going to cliffs trailer
well where are you going
i am going over here
coming along with him god damn you people are confusing
cooper reaches a pack of dirt which is now creased with tire tracks
what was here mr
a trailer was here
what the hell do you think
can you tell me whos trailer it was
and who stayed in the trailer
an old woman and her grandson
can you tell me what their names were
chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did
cooper kneels to examine the tracks left by the exited trailer
as he kneels and inspects the tracks he is overcome by the presence of something
cooper struggles to his feet and looks around
under a tree and close to the tracks is a car
is that agent desmonds vehicle
yep it sure is
cooper walks to it
cooper inspects the car
coming around to the front of the car he notices the windshield
on the windshield someone has written the words lets rock
cooper stares into the stream
dictating into his recorder diane its in the afternoon
i am standing here at wind river where they found the body of teresa banks
diane this case has got a strange feeling for me
not only has agent chester desmond disappeared but this is one of coles blue rose cases
the clues that were found by agent desmond and agent stanley have lead to dead ends
the letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again
but like the song says
who knows where or when
shot of the twin peaks sign
then on screen it reads laura palmer walking towards us
the picture of a homecoming queen
on screen it reads cooper talks with cole
gordon it is on february th
i was worried about today from the dream i told you about
not sure what to say cooper looks at the calendar in the room and checks his watch
he walks from the room
cooper stares into the lens of the camera for a moment
then sprints to the surveillance room
cooper stares at the monitor
sees nothing on the screen but an empty hallway
nice sunny day
the dity in all its glory
on screen it reads phillip jeffries checks into the hotel
heres your key mr
i hope you enjoy your stay here at the palm deluxe
grabs a note this is for you
she left it
rings the bell
a bellhop appears
young sweating and eager
jeffries hands him the key
he picks up jeffries bag and heads for the elevator
cooper runs out to the hall again stares into the camera
he stays there for a moment then runs back to the surveillance room
cooper stares at the monitor which still shows an empty hallway
he runs back out the door into the hallway
behind him at the end of the hall a door opens and phillip jeffries who moments ago was in buenos aires enters the hallway headed towards cooper but cooper doesnt
see him because he is staring intently into the camera as he has done twice before
cooper races into the room and stares into the monitor
this time cooper is amazed to see himself staring into the camera and behind him is phillip jeffries coming towards him and the camera
on the screen jeffries walks past cooper
cooper runs into gordons office
as cooper gets to gordons office albert and cole are standing there staring bug eyed at phillip jeffries
albert stands up
jeffries moves into the room
cooper steps into the office
jeffries stares at the threesome
im not going to talk about judy
keep judy out of this
cole calms cooper
pointing at cooper who do you think that is there
trying to calm jeffries suffered some bumps on the old noggin eh phil
pointing at cooper focusing on jeffries i want to tell you everything but i dont have a lot to go on
but ill tell you one thing judy is positive about this
i thought we were going to keep judy out of this
jeffries stumbles to a chair
listen to me carefully
i saw one of their meetings
it was above a convenience store
where have you been
it was a dream
takes albert by the arm we live inside a dream
and its raining post toasties
shouting no no
i found something
in seattle at judys
and then there they were
albert is about to say something but is stopped by coles gentle pressure on his arm
they sat quietly for hours
six people in a large barren filthy room
cheap plastic storm windows flap in the cold wind
in the foreground the man from another place mike and bob sit at a formica table
behind them on plastic torn chairs huddle mrs
tremond and her grandson
two big woodsmen with full beards sit quietly
subtitled we have descended from pure air
subtitled going up and down
intercourse between the two worlds
subtitled light of new discoveries
subtitled why not be composed of materials and combinations of atoms
subtitled this is no accident
subtitled this is a formica table
green is its color
he touches the table
subtitled our world
subtitled with chrome
any everything will proceed cyclically
subtitled yes find the middle place
bob begins to scream with anger
subtitled subtitled fell a victim
the man from another place raises his hand
subtitled fire walk with me
bob claps his hand and a circle of fire appears in the room
subtitled fire walk with me
we see the red room
bob crawls into the red room and mike starts to yell and leaps in after him
jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table
to himself the ring
hinting after a hesitation albert gets the message and discreetly leaves the room
cole continued cole tries to raise someone on the intercom but it doesnt seem to have any juice
cole continued into the speaker he is getting nothing
the static begins to build on the intercom
the wiring in the wall and the flourescent lights start to hum as well
cole continued pounds on the intercom hearing may jeffries turns and stares at a calendar on the wall
move into jeffries
staring at the calendar
cooper looks out of the room to see if anyone is coming to help cole who is still trying to get the intercom to work
the static grows even louder
cole turns back to jeffries
but there is no one there
jeffries is gone
papers from coles desk are now sticking to jeffries chair
coming back into the room what
on the phone ive got the front desk right now
he never was here
no record of him entering the building
and the doctors should be here any minute
frustration building whats going on
albert rushes back into the room
to cooper it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed
im wondering if the murderer will ever kill again
no offense sir but after a day with you it is mandatory
jeffries is suddenly standing in the second story hallway of the buenos aires palm deluxe hotel
the wall behind him is seared black and smoking
a terrified maid is whimpering and scampering away from jeffries trying to stave away an epileptic fit
she is looking at him like he is the devil personified
the bellhop had run further away but has turned back to see jeffries reappear
he is afraid to come any closer
to bellhop hey
half crying oh mr
de shit it come out of my ass
santa maria where did you go
they stare at each other as the blackened wall continues to smoke
cooper and cole sit in front of the monitor
cooper plays back the surveillance tape
it shows jeffries coming up behind cooper
then moving past him
cooper turns to cole
he was here
laura palmer continues down the sidewalk towards us
on screen it reads laura stops and turns
we suddenly find ourselves in front of the hayward house
donna hayward gathering her books and coming out the door
just a minute laura
donna joins laura

smiles youre just too adorable
smiles back you know i think youre right

donna grabs her and shakes her shoulders
sing song laura palmer youre just too adorable
joining her laughing im just too adorable
im just too adorable
they continue up the sidewalk laughing
on laura and donna as they walk in
five of their admirers watch laura and donna with love and worship
they sing a kind of pining but cool chant with knees bent and arms outstretched
on donna as they continue down the hall
a cool mike nelson snaps his fingers ala bobby for donna to come to him
without missing a beat donna changes directions
mike has to hustle to catch up with her
putting his arm around donna thats why you need a real man babe youre tough to handle
and youre the real man
james hurley moves up behind laura and pushes close to her
laura ill meet you at after phys
james smiles and walks off
laura enters the girls room
laura ducks into a stall and does a quick hit of cocaine
the school bell rings simultaneously
bobby briggs saunters into school late as usual
the corridor is empty
everyone else is in class
he walks to lauras portrait in the trophy case
kisses the glass protecting it
he continues on happy and ultra cool to his class
james waits for laura amidst the cleaning drums and brooms
the door swings open and laura slides in wearing only a towel
they embrace in the half light
laura do you love me
yes i love you
ive told you but it doesnt really matter
no it doesnt
just kiss me
it does matter
were in love
james you dont know what you are talking about
quit trying to hold on so tight
long gone like a turkey through the corn
youre not a turkey
a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth
small smile gobble gobble gobble
she kisses him and he responds
dont ever leave laura ever
ill never leave you
laura moves into him
a hopeless embrace
his eyes full of hope and lauras empty
she pulls him to the floor to make love
a bell rings and after a moment students and teachers start to move out
bobby catches up with laura and donna
where were you for the last hour
ive been lookin for you
i was right behind you but youre too dumb to turn around
laughing with donna if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down
bobby grabs her roughly and spins her around
students stop and stare
very angry get lost bobby
youll be callin soon and maybe im not gonna be there
very smooth cooing oh come on sweetie give me one of your smiles
bobby cant hold onto his anger
slowly a huge smile spreads across his face
smiling love ya babe
donna and laura
donna is stretched out on the sofa and laura is in a chair with her legs over the top
she is almost upside down
nothing going on
eileen hayward rolls through the living room in her wheelchair and makes a quick check of the nut supply
with a nod to laura to donna mom h
eileen motors out
donna continued to laura are you going to see james tonight
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night
nighttime is my time
youre telling me but only because you never let me in on any of it
youre not going to see bobby are you
oh god laura
well why not
because bobby is a loser you said so yourself
hes a goon
she sighs to herself james is the one
getting very dreamy he loves you with that lasting love
laura looks at donna
yes james is very sweet
why dont you get out your violin donna
god hes gorgeous
james is very sweet and very gorgeous
donna drifts off
i wonder if mike could ever write a poem
both of them drift off
donna continued do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster
faster and faster
for a long time you wouldnt feel anything
then you would burst into fire
donna studies her friend and thinks about what she has said
after a beat
maybe i better start our homework
okay i suppose i should go home
what do you want me to call you
call me anything just dont call me late for dinner
laura coming home from donnas
laura comes in the front door
no one seems to be home
no answer she heads up to her room
laura moves up to her bedroom
laura comes into her room and drops her books on her bed
she goes to the window and opens it takes a package of cigarettes out pulls one out and lights it
she goes to her public diary which she keeps on her desk
opens it to page one takes out a packet full of cocaine
like a pro she takes out her cocaine gadget from her purse and takes a snort
big sigh of relief
now she moves to her private diary behind her dresser gets a pen ready to write and starts to freak out
pages are missing
first she discovers one then more
dropping her cocaine gadget back into her purse and taking her private diary she sprints from the room
laura runs down the steps nearly colliding with her mom sarah palmer coming home with a load of groceries
a cigarette in her mouth
smoke going into her tearing eyes cigarette
laura takes it out of her mouth
can i take the car
sure honey whats the hurry
i forgot my books at school
laura runs from the house
laura looks back to see her mom dangling the car keys in front of her
laura comes back to get the keys still holding the burning cigarette
sarah sternly takes the cigarette from lauras hand
as they make the exchange
youll never be a smoker if you dont sarah continued start
i mean it
takes a drag
with barely a nod laura is gone
laura speeds through lotown in her moms roadmaster buick
laura skids up outside the apartment
then backs the car up to a darker more enclosed area amongst some trees
cautiously she gets out of the car and then hurries to harolds door
laura frantically knocks at the door
harold smith answers
laura rushes past him to the sofa opening the book for him to see
my secret diary
there are pages missing
who would do that
but bob isnt real
the pages are gone
bob is real
hes been having me since i was
stunned harold doesnt know what to do
laura continued the diary was hidden too well
hes the only one who could know where it was
hes getting to know me now
hes real he speaks to me
what does bob say
whisper he wants to be me
or he will kill me
strangely oh yes
laura starts towards him frightening harold
she allows the feeling of bob to come over her and she begins to scream
harold steps back but laura grabs him
to his face with a horrifying expression on hers
she buries herself on his shoulder
whispers the trees
laura continued you have to hide the diary harold
you made me write it all down
he doesnt know about you
youll be safe
she stares at harold
her eyes widen terrified with suspicion
youre not bob are you harold
if you are you can kill me right now
kill me right now if you are
laura no im not
im not bob
begins to shake and cry poor laura
i wish i could help you
he holds her
i hate him i hate it
sometimes i love it
but now im afraid
i am so afraid
but youre strong laura
so much stronger than i
how can i help you
i cant even go outside
laura reaches up and tenderly touches his cheek
harold continued what about james
cant james help you
you two are so in love
flat hes in love with a girl whos dead
handing him the diary it is dangerous for you to have it
thinking only of her im so sorry laura
she pulls him to her and kisses him passionately
i dont know when i can come back
laura slowly goes out the door
harold can only watch
laura goes out to the car
laura starts the car and takes a snort of cocaine
laura pulls out onto the highway
we stay with her watching her face struggling with the prospects of the terrifying future
laura rushes in to find her mom setting the table
sarah stops and stares at laura
you lied to me about those school books
i found them upstairs on your bed
suspicion and paranoia what were you doing in my room
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet
now why did you lie to me
where did you go
i had to see bobby
i know you really dont like bobby but there was a problem and i didnt think you would understand
oh honey you dont have to lie to me
you can tell me anything
im sorry mom
now hurry dinners almost ready
your father says hes starving
laura is already at the table
sarah puts the rest of the dinner on the table and sits down just as leland palmer enters from the kitchen
he is pretending he is a giant
using a voice like a giant
big giant voice hello laura
wheres my axe
singing im hungry
suddenly speaking norwegian hyggelig a mote dem
jeg heter leland palmer
translation is how are you
my name is leland palmer
laura and sarah stare at him
the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian
so you can talk to them
i want you to learn to say hello my name is leland palmer
but my name isnt leland palmer
neither is mine
and cant we talk about something serious for a change
this is serious
benjamin hornes got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself
sarah you first
leland repeats his phrase for sarahs benefit
hyggelig a mote dem
jeg heter leland palmer
sarah stumbles through it
hyggelig a mote dem
jeg heter sarah palmer
leland repeats his phrase back to her
extends his hand in a friendly handshake
well practice some more
laura now you try it
laughingly laura does the same thing
hyggelig a mote dem
jeg heter laura palmer
after laura is done
all together now
leland extends a hand to each of them
an air of insanity seems to come over the palmer dining room as they all begin to laugh hysterically and talk in broken norwegian
the clock reads
lauras hands open the window and release the screen
laura silently sneaks out the window and down the side of her house
a big semi comes to a stop at a wide spot in the road
laura climbs into the truck
the trucker smiles
friend of leos right
laura begins to unbutton her blouse
turns and sneaks a toot of cocaine
trucker continued catching her wait a minute
leo says this is my party
laura puts her hand between his legs
if you can fuck and drive the party starts right now
momentarily taken aback the trucker stares at her
laura takes his hand and puts it on the gear shift
laura continued you shift that one
this ones mine
she climbs over on top of him
the stack blows
the truck rolls away onto the road
we watch it as it moans into the distance the sound slowly diminishing and fading
natures nighttime sounds take over
finally we hear the hooting of an owl
albert and cooper
cooper the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads
do you honestly think coles practice of word association works
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association
the world is a hologram albert
yes its a great big psychedelic circus ride isnt it cooper
you said teresa banks so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder
either right now or right when i thought of it
the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me
lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again
because it is only a feeling i am powerless to stop it
and another thing albert when the next murder happens you will help me solve it
lets test it for the record
will the next victim be a man or a woman
what color hair will she have
tell me some other things about her
shes in high school
shes sexually active
shes on drugs
shes crying out for some help
youre describing half the high school girls in america
off coopers look what is she doing right now
closing his eyes to see a mental picture she is preparing a great abundance of food
albert lets go a small laugh of disbelief and shakes his head in exasperation
laura comes out of the kitchen stacking some of her meals on wheels on the counter
on screen it reads norma jennings and shelly johnson watch from the cash register
shelly is ringing someone out handing back their change
shelly would you give laura a quick hand with the meals on wheels
im kind of busy norma
youre not busy sweetheart now go
with a little squeeze of the hand and a gentle shove norma moves shelly towards laura who is at the end of the counter
the door opens to the diner and ed and nadine hurley come in
nadine stops when she sees norma
i changed my mind i dont want any coffee eddie
nadine goes out
as she walks past ed he looks at norma and makes a what can i do gesture
ed goes out
shelly approaches sheepishly
can i give you a hand getting the dinners together
thats alright shelly
i know you have better things to do
disregarding the jab norma asked me to give you a hand
you can help me carry them to the car
shelly gathers up a pile of the dinners and takes them out to the meals on wheels car
shelly loads her stuff in the back
she returns to the diner and laura follows doing the same
as laura places her dinners in the back something catches her eye and she turns
tremond and her grandson are standing in the parking lot staring at laura
tremond waves to laura to come over
when laura comes to them mrs
tremond holds out a framed picture
this would look nice on your wall
she hands laura the picture
it is a picture of a room with flowered wallpaper and a dark doorway in its corner
lauras study of it is interrupted by the grandson
hes looking for a book with pages torn out
hes walking towards the hiding place
hes moving under the fan now
shelly comes out of the diner with another load of meals
laura turns back to her and then back to the tremonds who are walking away from her and are farther away than they realistically could be
laura comes to shelly in a panic
shelly you really can help me
i cant do the meals on wheels today
i just cant
laura runs off
shelly puts her load into the car as she watches laura
shelly goes to norma
laura just took off
she asked me to do the run today
should i do it
whats with that laura
yeah sure take a look around
theres no one here anyway
theres no one here
theres no one here
norma are you alright
norma just turns away and picks up some dirty dishes
come back as soon as you can
if leo comes here he wont believe that i am out doing the meals on wheels
dont worry shelly ill handle leo
shelly leaves the diner
in the empty diner norma walks over and sits in a booth
she studies the empty diner
after a while the cook toad calls from the kitchen
a distant forlorn call
kind of quiet
she starts to cry
laura runs home
holding the picture from mrs
frantic whispers hes looking for the book hes going to the hiding place
she stops and stares
her house suddenly looks very frightening to her
she slowly crosses her front yard and enters the house
laura comes in the front door still holding the picture
she crosses thru the dining room
laura moves ever so slowly up the stairs the fan still and silent above her
at the top of the stairs she stops and stares at her bedroom door
her whole body is shaking
her hand goes out in front of her
she touches her bedroom door and inches it open
the opening of the door reveals more and more of her room
suddenly it reveals bob standing in her room at her dresser
he has pulled the dresser away from the wall looking for something
he is frozen
smiling at her
with a scream laura bolts from her room
laura races out of the house still holding tremonds picture
laura runs across two yards to a large tree and falls to her knees crying
she looks up and sees her father come out the front door of her house
she watches him cross to his car and drive away
frantic whisper what
it cant be
it cant be him
laura is coming apart sobbing
behind her on the sidewalk a neighbor has noticed her
a closer look reveals how upset laura is
laura are you all right
laura turns away so the woman cant see her crying
the woman takes a couple of steps off the sidewalk onto the grass
trying to hold it together i
lost my necklace
it must have fallen
laura mimes that she has found her gold half heart necklace
she pretends to be clasping her gold half heart necklace which was already around her neck
clumsily oh here it is
woman moves back to the sidewalk
well im glad you found it darling
slowly laura stands and moves away leaving mrs
tremonds picture on the grass under the tree
laura stands in front of her house
listens to the house
stands in the entrance way
she stops and stares at the fan then slowly makes her way up the stairs towards her room
no bob in her room
the dresser is back in its place
laura races out
laura runs down the sidewalk
donna answers the door
laura stands there out of breath
donna are you my best friend
laura dives toward donna and into a hug
what is it laura
i just want a friend
just one friend for just one minute
laura how about one friend for the rest of your whole life
yes thats what i want
looks into lauras eyes a step toward confronting something unspoken i am your friend
i feel that you dont like being around me because i am so uptight
off lauras look no i am uptight
i hate it
i dont want to be this way but laura i dont
im your friend no matter what way you are
you know even when i think about your face i get happier
they go in and sit down on the couch
do you want to talk
no i want to smoke
she digs for a cigarette in her purse
im in a mess today too
takes a breath im thinking about doing it with mike
what do you think
still looking for a cigarette donna you are such a crack up
you dont even like mike
is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight
this is about sex not like
yells to the kitchen mom lauras here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins
to laura you want a muffin
if i can smoke it
you want a muffin
donna you are a muffin
they hear doc hayward in the kitchen
he walks in with a magicians handkerchief
with a flourish he tries to pull something out of it
instead he stands there empty handed
the red rose
where is the red rose
frustrated you know the light at sparkwood and
it worked right there
i just did it right there
laura finds a cigarette finally and lights it
stands and stares at laura smoking why is it that you cant smoke at your home and im a doctor and i dont allow smoking in my home and i
let you smoke in my home
smiling her killer smile because you love me so much
i do love you you little smoking whipper snapper
eileen hayward brings out the muffins on her lap in her wheel chair
all four have muffins
these muffins each have at least seven full huckleberries in them
while eating doc takes out a piece of paper and stares blankly at it
the girls exchange glances about what dad is doing as they chew on the muffins
doc is struggling
dad what in the world are you doing
what the hell is this
donna peeks over his shoulder
its a prescription
my handwriting is so bad that now i cant even read it
you girls better hurry up and graduate from high school so you can take care of me
well take care of you
they go over to doc and give him a knuckle rub
eileen laughs along with the two girls
the phone rings and doc gets it
on the phone yep shes right here leland
to laura its for you
its your father
laura goes tentatively to the phone
time to come home for dinner honey
laura hangs up the phone
i gotta go
donna leads laura to the door
there is something wrong and donna is beginning to feel it
donna tries to cheer her up
no youre the muffin
as donna closes the door laura calls back to her
no youre right
i am the muffin
laura comes in the door and there is leland at the dining room table ready for dinner
leland sees her
hi honey hows donna
are you hungry
laura just plops into her seat
you didnt wash your hands before you sat down for dinner did you
from across the table leland looks at her fingernails
he stands to come for a closer look
let me see
your hands are filthy
look there is dirt way under this fingernail
sarah cigarette draped from her lips is delivering some mashed potatoes to the table
leland what are you doing
look at this finger here
he is looking at the finger
laura didnt wash her hands before dinner
noticing the necklace and look at this
he reaches for it
lauras hand flies up and stops him
lelands other hand comes up and she lets him take the half heart out
oh is this from a lover
laura has no response
leland continued did you get this from your lover
they dont call them lovers in high school leland
bobby didnt give you this
how would you know if bobby didnt give her that
leland starts pinching lauras cheek
as he is pinching did bobby give you that or is there someone new
leland leave her alone
she doesnt like that
how do you know what she doesnt like
a beat then a return to what is normal
oh leland sit down and eat you dinner
oh ill sit down but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands
leland sits stoically
laura rises from the table
as laura washes her hands she stares at her reflection
sarah and leland get ready for bed
leland stops stands frozen for a moment then begins to cry
what is it leland
leland can barely speak
i cant remember the last time i told laura that i loved her
sarah goes to leland
they embrace tenderly across the many years of their strained marriage
well honey go in and tell her now
laura stares at the hands of the clock
with a start she looks up
her father is in her room
he stands in the doorway
he moves to her and touches her face
leland continued i love you
i love you so much
laura can hardly speak
she squeezes his hand
he leaves the room
laura watches the door close
she sits frozen for a moment with a tear in her eye then she remembers something
the picture lies there in the night dew under the tree in the neighbors yard
laura goes down the trellises and runs across the lawn
laura hunts around the tree for the picture finally finds it
she runs back towards her house
laura climbs through the window and hangs the picture on a little hook on the wall and crawls into bed
she turns off the light and stares at the picture in the dark
she is asleep
we hold on the picture
as if by magic we suddenly begin to move into the picture into the room in the picture and thru the dark doorway in the room in the picture
on the other side of the dark doorway there is another room
tremond is standing in that room
she is beckoning us towards her and beyond her thru yet another doorway
we move thru the second doorway and on the other side of that doorway there is another room
tremonds grandson is standing in that room
he is holding his hands above him as if he is grasping an imaginary glass ball
as we move towards the space between his hands a ring of fire appears there and we move thru that into
the man from another place walks into the red room to a table
a ring lies upon the table
cooper enters the red room
the man from another place turns toward cooper
is it future
or is it past
do you know who i am
i am the arm
and i sound like this
the man from another place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an indian whooping sound
the man from another place picks up the ring and moves it very close to us
we recognize it as teresa banks ring
the symbols on the ring are identical to the symbols of owl cave
cooper seems concerned
to camera dont take the ring
laura dont take the ring
the man from another place moves the ring towards us till the ring fills the screen
laura in a somnambular state is half awakened by a noise
she tries to move her left arm but it has fallen asleep
she moves it with her right arm
it sounds as if someone is calling her name
she turns to her right to see who it is then turning back to her left she discovers annie blackburn lying in bed with her
annie has blood around her mouth
she tries to raise herself and strains to speak
my name is annie
ive been with laura and dale
the good dale is in the lodge and he cant leave
write it in your diary
her mother calls her name
the sound is distant and mournful
laura looks towards her door then turns back to annie but she is gone
filled with fear she looks down and in her hand is teresa banks ring
again her attention is drawn to her door and her mothers distant call
still holding the ring she gets out of bed and goes to her door and slowly opens it
it is dark on the other side of the door
in the doorway laura gets a strange feeling in back of her and turns to look at mrs
there in the picture is laura herself in the doorway looking back into the darkened rooms where mrs
tremond and her grandson were
laura is in the picture
in the picture laura turns around in the doorway of the picture and looks down at her room
laura sees herself asleep in her bed
asleep in her bed
she wakes up from her dream
trying to clear her head
looks at the photo and nothing is there looks like the day before
she looks in her hand and the ring is gone
laura gets out of bed and goes to mrs
tremonds picture hanging on the wall
she stares at it
she slowly takes it off the wall and places it in the trash
trembling she does two lines of cocaine
on screen it reads james comes by on his bike
he beeps out a signal on the bikes horn
after a beat laura runs out to him
where were you last night
we were supposed to get together
you didnt show up
you were supposed to show up
maybe i wasnt
we were supposed to be together
how can i be together if im not together
youre on somethin again arent you
when am i going to see you
leland comes out the door of the house
looks at laura and james
laura can feel him staring
i gotta go
james just looks at her then guns his bike and roars away
laura walks back to the front door where her father stands
who was that
a friend from school
a special friend
laura looks at her dad eyeball to eyeball for a moment
then she walks past him to the stairs
the fan turns slowly as laura goes up the stairs
lauras head snaps around
no go away
im glad you let me talk to you
you used to not let me talk to you
i am not talking to you
i want you
sarah palmer is at the bottom of the stairs
laura now i cant find that blue sweater
did you take it again
what are you wearing
sarah looks down
she is wearing the sweater that she is looking for
my god i am going to have another breakdown
mom take it easy
laura starts down the stairs towards her mother
this cant be happening
laura holds her mother
mom youre not having a nervous breakdown
sarah pulls away from laura and wanders into the living room
laura watches her go feeling helpless
leo johnson is ragging on shelly
he is down on his hands and knees showing her how to scrub the floor
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot
shelly i know where everything in this house is
sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is
lay off the bennies leo
continuing his tirade anybody can clean the surface of an object but dirt can find its way anywhere
to really clean you have to scrub below the surface
shouting he scrubs more
leo continued thats one thing you are going to learn shelly how to clean
it takes scrubbing shelly
there is no easy way
as if i didnt know
im going to show you how to wash this tile and then youre going to do it
come off it leo
im late for work
what did you say
leo goes over the top pulls shelly down to the floor
shelly i am not fooling around anymore
the first thing youve got to work on is a good attitude
thats the key
anybody will tell you that
gives her a good shot to the back of the head
shelly falls to the floor
the phone rings
leo gets up to get the phone
dont even think about going anywhere shelly
im not finished with you
he answers the phone
what are you doing calling me here
no way you already owe me money
five thousand to be exact
leo looks over at shelly suspiciously
did she hear him mention the five thousand
silently mouthing it five thousand
bobby is calling from the pay phone at the diner
we hear the end of the conversation with leo
bobby hangs up
he puts in another quarter and dials again
the phone rings on the other end
a nearly empty roadhouse
jacques renault answers the phone behind the bar
how come you only call me when you are desperate
are you desperate baby
you interested or not
maybe bobby baby
i have friend who has what you want
his stuff is the best
bobby starts to write information down on a napkin
you crazy canadian
this sounds big
donna drives up in her car and gets out
laura is having a quick shot from the family liquor cabinet
a knock on the door
laura pulls a jacket on and goes to the door
opens it and sees donna
donna looks at her coat
where are you going
no place fast
a warning and youre not coming
come on laura
im your best friend
they move back into the living room
change of subject isnt tonight the night you are going to do it with mike
laura arent you going to fix me a drink
laura shoots her a look
where are the cookies
you mean fred and ginger
donna looks around at all the ashtrays filled to the brim with butts
looking at the cigarettes if i had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked id be dead
gotta go donna
ill call you tomorrow
laura leaves the house
donna trails behind
laura gets into her moms roadmaster and takes off
donna watches her go and gets in her car and follows
at the first stop sign laura takes another hit of cocaine
laura parks her car and gets out
at the entrance to the roadhouse she meets the log lady who seems to be waiting for her
she steps close to laura
when this kind of fire starts
it is very hard to put out
the log lady touches her
her hand is cooling on lauras head
laura moves in behind it
pushing the cool hand into her face and forehead
the tender bows of innocence burn first and the wind rises then all goodness is in jeopardy
they look into each others eyes
the log lady turns and leaves
lots of bikers and the usual gang
on stage a singer sings
as laura comes in she makes eye contact with jacques renault who is behind the bar
laura sits at a table
jacques nods to a couple of burly truckers who come over to laura with drinks
one of them slides her a fifty with a packet of cocaine inside
lets go around the world babe
this isnt going to get you to walla walla
they all take a drink
you do go all the way dont you little girl
sooner or later
laura reaches below the table grabbing him hard by the balls
you willing to go all the way
you wanna do it for me
all the way for me means all the way dead
the trucker turns a couple of shades towards white
donna comes in just as a beautiful song of lost love begins
laura and donna see each other as the truckers toss down bourbons and beer chasers laura gets lost in the song and starts to cry
donna just stares at her from the other side of the roadhouse
donna stands and walks over to lauras table
she reaches down picks up one of the truckers bourbons and downs it
to donna you part of the deal
answering for her no she isnt
laura and donna stare at each other
for donnas benefit laura turns and gives a big juicy french kiss to one of the truckers
to the trucker what was your name again
buck that was really nice
donna grabs bucks buddy tommy and gives him the same type kiss
laura continued very serious all right donna
the car barrels down the highway
its a beat up chevy biscayne with a hot monster engine under the hood
tommy drives sitting next to a case of ice cold beer
donna and laura sandwich buck in the back seat
donna takes a long swig of beer
laura hides a hit of cocaine from donna
to laura a little afraid what are you doing
laura laughs at donna then holds a beer up to show donna then turns and french kisses buck
donna reaches forward to the front dash and turns the radio up full blast
buck and tommy start to whoop and yodel like cowboys
buck does an indian whoop in lauras face
laura freezes in horror
the man from another place the arm yodels
slowly laura reaches over and touches bucks face and arm
buck uncorks another yodel
the fear leaves laura
to laura im goin for it
donna starts making out with buck
tommy takes the car like a rocket into the parking lot and does a complete three sixty before rocking to a stop
several big rigs shadow the lot
they all pop out of bucks car sporting long necks
laura takes a hit of cocaine and looks up to see donna watching
buck circles donna with his big arm and puts a toot under her nose
turns to laura i dont need to take this to be you friend
yes you do donna
what a downer you are
pointing to skid marks behind a heat popping car hey tommy jacques beat us here
hold on im chokin the farm fed
tommy stands in the lot with his back to them pissing
the front room is a bar and restaurant with about three patrons
above the bar is a sign that reads can a do and u
of fuckin a the bartender presses a release underneath the counter that allows laura to take her three friends thru a door over which a sign hangs announcing in red
neon letters the group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet imaginable
in the back corner is a small stage
on it a three piece hell metal band is building up toward oblivion
the lead singer is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo head and horns
he wears spray painted day glow orange cowboy boots
some half dressed girls and cowboys are dancing to the band
in darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the band to oblivion
laura leans over to donna noticing her shocked look
dont expect a turkey dog in here
jacques renault comes up to the group
hey slow pokes guess what
theres no tomorrow
he grabs laura up and gives her a big sloppy wet kiss
baby you know why
cause itll never get here
slurred no jacques
i am the great went
for donna i am the muffin
and what a muffin you have
the two truckers laugh with jacques
he mimes a gun with his right hand and pointing it to his forehead pulls the trigger with a weak slack cheeked puff sound
slurred i am as blank as a fart
laura winks at buck as he secretly drops a red depth charge into donnas beer
hey donna chug a lug
as the cowboys gather around and begin to chant both laura and donna chug down their drinks
they finish and laura smiles and pushes donna out onto the dance floor
they start to dance expertly and smile at each other
soon buck and tommy cut in separating the two
buck dances laura over to another of his buddies
the two of them start to unbutton lauras blouse as they dance
the hell metal band kicks into high gear
in the pulsating red and black light donna sees laura now topless dancing and kissing with buck and his friend
jacques sweeps in
oh lauras friend
i am the great went
jacques holds her head in his huge hands
jacques continued there is no tomorrow
the room starts to spin
a completely stoned donna is being dances around by tommy who is falling in love with her
through some dancing legs and feet she spots lauras blouse on the floor
teetering she leans over picks up the blouse and ties it around her waist
ronette pulaski flying high makes her way through the crowd to laura
they spot each other and give each other a hug
you smell nice
havent seen you since i was thrown out of one eyed jacks
trying to focus on laura what else did we do together
oh i remember
tries to dance with laura hey you know what
its been a year

jacques comes up to them
the party twins
my high school sandwich

the three of them move around together
shes been dead a year
yeah a whole year
yeah she was going to get rich
she was blackmailing somebody
she called me
she even asked me what your fathers looked like
she asked about my father
but it wasnt him
she was after a huge guy six foot four with a broken nose
she said he looked just like a boxer
speaking of sandwiches
i think bobby was arranging something for you
gets the idea speaking of arrangements
louder speaking of arrangements
why dont you two come up to the cabin this week
leo and i know that santy claus is coming to town
ronette laura and jacques sway with distorted smiles
as they hug and almost kiss okay jacques
turning to kiss jacques the great went
buck and another friend move in on laura and ronette
buck pushes laura down on the carpet and gets on behind her
his friend does the same to ronette
the two girls find themselves face to face
here we go again
like were back at one eyed jacks
moaning with pleasure oh god
it sure is
ronette looks over lauras shoulder
shit is that donna hayward
laura looks across the rug through dancing legs and sees donnas head tilted way back with some new cowboy on top of her
screaming laura stumbles and runs to donna grabbing jacques on the way
laura continued screaming to jacques get her out of here
get her out
he doesnt seem to be listening
laura continued shouting laura falls full of panic to donna
laura continued donna what are you doing
rips her blouse off her waist
donna is completely gone
laura shakes her and screams into her face
laura continued dont ever wear my stuff dont ever wear my stuff
mumbling okay i wont wear your stuff
why cant i wear your stuff
jacques help me get her home
jacques lifts donna up and laura follows jacques and donna out of partyland
donna continues to mumble
i wont wear your stuff
then laughing i promise
crying holding donnas hand not you donna not you
on the screen it reads folks filing out of church
a couple strolling down the sidewalk
a happy dog bounds about
out in the yard of the hurley house ed hurley tries to skin a deer which is hanging off a branch of a tree
he is not having much luck and is not showing much enthusiasm either
nadine hurley comes storming out the house with her own very large butcher knife very upset with eds progress
pushing him away ill take over here
ed backs off and nadine dives in slicing
you were cutting this deer like a sissy
sit down and watch while i do it
ed slowly backs into the house
ed joins his assistant sparky and they stand in the living room gazing out the window at nadine ferociously skinning the deer
with a wink works every year
sure wouldnt work at my house
my wife couldnt take the wrapper of a twinkie
sheriff truman and josie packard break from a kiss
smiling truman goes back to gently strumming his guitar
josie i think we should go public
that would be wonderful but its only been a year since andrew died
what are you afraid of
what people think
i dont want to offend the customs of your country
believe me josie you would not offend the customs of this country
for instance i dont eat fish eyes
even if it offended someone i wouldnt eat a fish eye
why wouldnt you eat a fish eye harry
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle
he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat
i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble
his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing
and he couldnt swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his
eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldnt get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver
i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy
they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling
it just stuck up there and spread out
it was about the size of a half dollar
and thats why i dont ever eat fish eyes
he plays the guitar for josie
truman continued im not saying its right or wrong its just the way i feel
its the custom thing i was thinking of
in america we dont use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides
we throw away the tail the rest of the insides and the head
we throw away the whole head
philip gerard the one armed man in a deep sweat kneels in front of a circle of twelve lit candles fighting for air and struggling to hear something
donna and laura sit across from one another on the couch
i cant remember anything about last night
is there something i should remember
no you should forget about last night
laura i am your friend
i know you are and you dont have to do anything crazy to prove it
youre not mad at me

she takes donnas head into her hands and kisses her
leland is standing at the other end of the room
as he stares at the girls we move in on his face
leland looking into another room seeing laura and ronette sitting face to face on a bed
leland looking at the girls
excuse me honey
laura turns to him with a start
leland continued were late to meet mom for breakfast
to laura catch you later
leland and laura leave
leland and laura drive along
leland becomes preoccupied with something in his rear view mirror
laura turns to see a car erratically coming up behind them
leland slows down and stops for a red light at sparkwood and twenty one
in front of them is a huge logging truck
laura smells something
dad is the engine on fire
something is burning
leland turns and gives her a look
the car that was tailing them races around them races around the logging truck and comes back around stopping on lelands side of the car
leland spots gerard the one armed man behind the wheel sweating like crazy
laura continued something is burning
leland starts to rev his engine while holding the brake with his left foot
its the engine
you stole the corn
i had it canned above the store
leland is panicked
the car is slowly screeching towards the large lumber truck in front of them
shouting at laura miss the look on her face when it was opened
there was a closeness
like the formica table top
the car is now smoking and making a horrendous sound
gerard continues to yell but we can barely hear it
the thread will be torn mr
palmer the thread will be torn
leland turns to laura
sweat pours from his forehead
while leland is turned away gerard holds up his hand with a ring on the little finger
he is shouting over the engine noise and the horn which leland has begun to blow frantically
shouting its him
its your father
laura cant make this out over the noise
the light turns green
gerard takes off away from them
as soon as the logging truck moves leland lets go of the brake and the car flies into a service station on their right
everyone around there has been watching a commotion on a sunday afternoon
what was that all about
who was that
a young mechanic runs up to their car
you shouldnt do that to your engine
you ought to take it easy mr
youre going to burn your engine out
what the hell was all that
why doesnt someone do something about all of this
my god that guy came out of nowhere
he was harassing my daughter
leland stares at laura trying to compose himself
dad are you all right
the title fleshworld on a magazine
in the magazine we see leland find a picture of teresa banks
you look so much like my laura
leland dials the phone
she is talking on the phone
that sounds like fun
where did you see my picture
okay come to the blue diamond city motel
yes thats just your side of blue diamond city

room one two three
right as in get ready
on top of teresa in bed
smiling whens the next business trip big fella
how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about

i like that
he kisses her and covers her eyes with a hand
what are you doing
who am i

end of flashback
leland is still sitting and staring at laura
trying to get his attention dad
who was that
how do you know him
he looked familiar
have i met him
no you havent met him
have you met him
were late to get to your mother
just sit here for a moment
you seem very upset
mumbling to himself guy just pulls up out of the blue
what is this world coming to
open on a sign saying blue diamond city motel
leland comes down an outside walkway towards an open room
suddenly he stops short and jumps back
he cautiously takes a second look and sees laura and ronette sitting on the edge of a king size bed talking
leland is about to leave when there is a tap tap tap on his back
he spins around to see teresa banks who has come up behind him
moving further from the room nothing i chickened out
he shoves a wad of money into her hand and practically runs away
teresa cocks her head and wonders while she watches him hurry away
end of flashback
leland and laura are in the car
leland starts the car
are you sure youre okay
leland pulls out onto the road
after they drive for a bit
did you come home during the day last week
oh i thought i saw you
you know i did come home come to think of it on thursday
i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house
studies laura where were you laura
i didnt see you
i was down the street
laura studies the look in her fathers eye as long as she dares and then turns away
as he drives along
teresa watching with her head cocked as leland hurries off
what does ronettes father look like
a short guy
what does laura palmers father look like
wavy black hair
he looks like a movie star
into phone no this was a big huge guy
like he was a boxer
teresa hangs up the phone and redials smiling as though she has won the lottery
he answers the phone
hey handsome this is your little party girl
his jaw tightens
leland pulls the car into the double r
sarah stands out front waving
calling where were you two
laura sits at her desk staring off into space
laura remembers the one armed man yelling out to her
her attention now goes to his one hand
she remembers the look of the ring he was wearing
then she remembers the man from another place giving her the ring in her dream
it is the same ring
then she remembers being in the blue diamond city motel with ronette when teresa entered the room
the guy split
teresa sits down between them and brings them close to her in a sexual embrace
teresa brushes away some hair that has fallen over her face
as she does this laura sees the same ring
teresa continued as she moves her hair away i guess its just us girls
to herself the same ring
laura is jolted by bobs voice
thats not important
i will tell you what is important
the fan will soon be starting
who are you
who are you really
bobs voice continued i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth
leland pacing the living room
nighttime in the woods
we see leland crush teresa banks face and skull with a pipe until she is dead
we hear the gurgling of the wind river behind her
leland continues to pace
he wipes some sweat from his forehead
a sign on the screen reads laura sits at the dining room table eating her breakfast
leland pokes his head in
cheerfully dont forget its johnny hornes birthday today
lauras hands are shaking as she does a line of cocaine
it is the last stuff she has she puts the empty packet into her diary
laura corners bobby in a hallway

donna comes around next to james
together they watch laura walk away
establish open on lauras picture on top of ben hornes desk
then discover that leland is staring at lauras picture
wider we see benjamin horne trying to blow up a large rubber indian for his son johnny
sylvia and jerry horne stand nearby supervising
johnny comes up one inch in front of lelands face
happy birthday johnny
happy birthday johnny
johnny moves to one inch in front of jerrys face

ben reacts to a huge moccasin print in the middle of the birthday cake in the middle of his office floor

and look at the new decorations johnnys provided
they look down and see johnnys foot completely ringed in white frosting roses
frosted footprints trail behind him everywhere
johnny goes one inch in front of lauras picture

she moves in closer and kisses him
bobby roars thru the night with his radio blasting
her clock reads
we move across to get a glimpse of laura going out the window
bobbys car skids to a stop and laura jumps in
whipping down a country road
laura and bobby tooting coke as they fly thru the night
we got to wait till midnight

bobby continued pats the money that sits next to him for bobby and lauras big score

pete starts to clean the inside of his windshield while ed returns to work on the outside
as he cleans even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain
brother i hear you talkin
bobby and laura pull into a little clearing
bobby kills the lights
the doors open
laura and bobby start to make their way thru the woods
laura and bobby continue thru the woods
it gets spookier and spookier
they reach the meeting place
awesomely quiet until a twig snaps then a distant howling of a wolf
bobby and laura sit on the floor of the woods and do some more toot
laura picks up a leaf and shows it to bobby
whispers bobby i found a leaf
after a moment of staring at it they both begin to giggle
she picks up a twig
laura continued bobby i found a twig
they giggle twice as hard
laura picks up a pinecone and starts knocking him on the head with it
laura continued bobby i found a pinecone
they giggle three times as hard and start crawling around giggling
suddenly they hear footsteps
they freeze and try to stifle their giggles
here he comes
here he comes
they both start laughing again
they see a guy coming through the woods
we recognize him as the sullen deputy from deer meadow cliff howard
suddenly serious who sent you
the deputy takes out a very big bag of coke showing it to them
laura continued wow
laura just grabs it out of his hand
the deputy takes out his gun
bobby panics and pulls out his gun
bobby shoots the deputy in the shoulder but the deputy still prepares to shoot at bobby so bobby shoots him again
this time in the chest
the deputy spins and tries to run but bobby shoots him in the back
he topples over dead
they stand there frozen
absolutely no more giggles
laura continued god bobby
what did you do
they just stand there looking at the dead body
i shot him
oh my god i shot him
bobby starts for the dead body
bobby continued come on you gotta help me
with lauras help they get the body back to the clearing
they fall down to their knees out of breath staring at what they have done
their faces register the shock of having just killed someone
laura looks at bobbys stunned expression
look at your face
a laugh squirts out of laura
bobby turns to her in disbelief
laura continued bobby you killed mike
bobby stares at her for a second like laura has gone insane
this isnt mike
suddenly unsure surreal is this mike
you killed mike
they begin to laugh uncontrollably
the distant sounds of bobby and laura laughing
up closer the wind takes over and even closer the hooting of an owl
then the fans pov down on laura entering the stairwell
we drift down on laura
i want to kill thru you
laura stops cold on the stairway
looking up no
i want you to kill for me
youll have to kill me
i want you to kill for me
laura looking up petrified
the trophy case with lauras homecoming queen picture within
on screen it reads bobby catches up with laura in front of her locker
he shows her the ten thousand they were going to use to pay for the drugs last night
babe im on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product
put this cash in your safety deposit box
whispers its ten thousand dollars
acting real serious you killed mike
bobby is about to get really pissed when laura starts laughing again
bobby fights to stay in control
im not going to give you this if you dont stop laughing
its not one god damn bit funny
laura stifles her laugh with all her might
bobby hands her the money
after a beat laura starts to laugh but stops herself again by biting her lip
bobby is furious and scared
laura covers her mouth
bobby breaks again
bobbys car skids to a stop
bobby jumps out and pops the trunk
he unwraps the big bag of cocaine from a blanket
he tears a little hole in it to enjoy a taste test
the second it touches the tongue he panics and frantically takes a deeper test
screaming he sprays and throws the powder every which way in a rage
bobby continued laura lies in bed
she leans over to the bedside table and snorts a line
the phone rings and startles her
she answers it
jacoby on the phone
laura you didnt come and see me today
in a whisper i couldnt it was johnny hornes birthday
i promised id be with him
i told you not to call me here
a little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something i am certainly willing to put up with
did you make me a tape
i already made you two tapes
laura you have to deal with all of this
im dealing with it doc
maybe ill make you a tape tomorrow
send me a kiss
she hangs up
sarah at her vanity puts a cigarette out and walks to her bed as leland brings up a big glass of warm milk to her
sarah looks up at leland and they share a look as she drinks the milk
after sarah finishes her milk leland walks into the hallway
leland hits the fan switch
laura freezes when she hears the fan
she closes her eyes
sarahs head is nodding
her heavy eyelids close
her eyes pop open once more
sarah sees the white horse in her room
she falls asleep
the room is dark
laura is pressed up against the headboard of her bed staring at the window
the fan ominously whirls in the hall
bob appears in her window and enters the room
bob moves down on top of her
his hand moves between her legs
laura more august
fights with all her might to keep staring at his face
to know it
to unlock it
her hands go up
she holds his face
squeezes it as he moves on top of her
slowly what she always knew deep inside of her becomes clear
she screams and passes out into hell
on screen it reads sarah sits at the dining room table smoking
laura pushes her spoon around in the soggy cereal
leland stares at her
laura i would like to talk to you
is something wrong
laura gets up and leaves the room
leland stares at the empty door
he waits for a moment and then follows her
sarah nervously watches him go
laura is getting her school materials together when leland enters
whats wrong this morning
whispering threat stay away from me
never taking her eyes off him she works her way around him and leaves the room
we stay on leland
his face changes
he knows she knows and he knows what he has to do
laura walks to school
all the beautiful natural sounds of morning sound like hell to her
distorted chants from hell
laura studies the clock hand going round and round
every sound in the room is distorted
laura rises from her chair
camera stays on her empty chair
the chair she will never sit in again
a plate of asparagus
the mashed potatoes and the roast beef have been mostly eaten
on screen it reads laura and her mother sit eating alone
i hate asparagus
sure you do its good for you
they eat in silence for a moment
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians
if its okay with you im going to bobbys to do my homework
its a school night
back by nine
betty briggs lets laura in the front door
hi laura bobbys in the basement

garland briggs chuckles off screen
laura comes down stairs and sees bobby lying on the floor
his hands covering his eyes
concerned whats up bobby
laura sits down next to him
bad news kid it was baby laxative

laura stares at him
bobby continued its okay
he reaches in his pocket and gives her a nice bag of coke plus pills
bobby continued bobbys got it

looking at the packet and my little round friends too
they head upstairs
briggs is reading aloud to mrs
briggs from the book of revelations
as bobby hears this he turns to laura and makes a look of horror which says can you believe i live here
bobby takes laura to the door
he gives her a small kiss good night
after she leaves he cuts back thru the living room and just as he clears the room he lights up
looking up from the bible robert put out the cigarette
and briggs returns to the bible
sheriff truman and andy sit at the small table with doughnuts and coffee
andy monitors the radio
lucy moran cuts thru on the intercom
over the intercom sheriff truman
truman hits the intercom button
over intercom mrs
packard called and said she heard what she thinks could be a prowler outside her house

lucys voice continued thing

truman stands up puts on his gun and leaves
lucys voice continues as we watch andy sit there alone
lucys voice continued she couldnt get rid of her raccoons because she made the big mistake of feeding them albacore tuna

whispers frightened andy
where did andy go
she races from her station and collides with andy coming up from the interrogation room
they both scream
sarah sits smoking and reading a cheap magazine as laura moves thru the living room
good night mom
good night sweetheart
laura moves up the stairs
she does three lines of bobbys cocaine
trying to hold on
the phone rings
no james i do love you but
okay ill meet you in fifteen minutes
she hangs up the phone and does another line of cocaine then swallows down a handful of red round friends from bobby the pills
laura continued fifteen minutes
god why did i say that
what did i say
as laura sneaks out she sees her dad coming home
leland comes out of the car
laura ducks into some bushes and hides
leland stops in the middle of the yard sensing something
he looks right at where laura is hiding
she cant tell if he can see her or not
she hears james bike coming in the distance
frantically to herself go inside
james bike sounds closer and closer
leland turns opens the front door and goes into the house
james drives up
lelands face appears looking out the front window
laura jumps on the bike behind james and off they go
james and laura drive thru the night
james brings the bike thru the woods and stops in the little clearing
james tries to kiss laura she pushes him away

james grabs her trying to control her
she twists out of his arms
laura continued how bout this james
she lifts her hand and gives him the finger
james ignores the finger and kisses her but shes gone ice cold
laura continued i think you want to take me home now james
she leads him back to the bike
he wont start it
laura continued oh quit crying
ive had enough of your fucking caring
he kicks the bike to a start
behind him laura watches and silently starts to cry
laura and james on the bike make their way down to sparkwood and twenty one
laura leans way back on the bike
looking up at the trees as they fly by in a dark blur
laura screams with agony and tries to get off as they approach the light
laura falls off as they skid to a stop
confused and terrified laura
laura crawls back up and puts her hands around james neck
from far away she screams for a moment she focuses on him
she looks like the laura that james loves
innocent and beautiful
laura turns and sees the woods
it pulls her
she releases her hold on james and runs into the waiting darkness
the red light swings in the wind above james
it turns green but he doesnt move
when the light turns red again james guns the engine and lifts the bike up on its back tire
james screams then roars down the road away from us
off to the side of the road lies doc haywards wilted red rose
laura runs up thru the woods
at the packard logging road laura meets jacques leo and ronette all standing around leos red corvette
right on time baby
buy me a ticket to the great went
were on our way baby
lets go all the way
they pile into leos vet and peel down the dirt road
the foursome getting roasted and toasted very high
jacques starts to tie laura up with some light rope
drugged screaming dont tie me up tonight
dont tie me up
jacques and leo laugh
jacques starts to tie laura up while leo holds her
laura struggles and screams begging them not to do it
with laura tied up leo starts to tie up ronette
both girls are half naked and have been tied up
waldo the bird is screeching
jacques is straddling laura and is hurting her badly
leo puts a one eyed jacks thousand dollar poker chip in her mouth
bite the bullet baby
like a ghost leland appears in the window
no one sees him
laura continues to scream
leo gets up and goes for the bottle of bourbon
he takes a swig and then steps back to jacques and laura
referring to laura let me have a little of that
pointing at the bourbon let me have a little of that baby
leo holds the bottle tight
jacques stands up and decks leo with his big french canadian paw
he grabs the spilling bottle from the floor and stumbles outside
when jacques comes out of the cabin leland trips him grabs the bottle and breaks it over jacques head knocking him out cold
leo hears the crash and comes outside
he sees jacques bleeding on the ground
he panics and weaves down the hill to his corvette and takes off
leland goes into the cabin
his smiling eyes are on laura while he rapes ronette
laura watches as her fear drives her to hysteria
in the darkness the log lady holds her log and listens
she hears distant screams
the camera moves down her leg to reveal her tattoo beet red and burning
philip gerard the one armed man runs like a madman up the trail towards jacques cabin
with the face of the devil leland double time marches laura and ronette out the cabin door and thru the woods
screaming pleading for her life gasping for breath gerard arrives at the cabin too late
he stares at the open doorway
jacques lies passed out at his feet
gerard cocks his head straining to hear something
he hears distant screams
bob i can hear you singing
leland hauls the two girls into the train car
he slides the door shut and it is completely quiet
bob and leland going in and out like breathing
the two girls shudder in the corner as he circles them
leland grabs laura and begins to wrap the twine around her arms bending the arms back
whispers are you going to kill me
gerard tearing thru the woods
the wind comes up carrying with it cries and screams and the sounds of bob
leland hoists laura up so that she hovers facing the floor a foot off the ground
he places a mirror on the floor directly under her face
laura sees herself turn into bob
leland screams into space
i always thought you knew it was me
into bob in the mirror to leland gerard arrives outside
he bangs on the train door
the door opens a little bit because ronette is pushing it with her feet
gerard reaches up to help her when suddenly she flies over his head having been hit
ronette hits the ground her unconscious head bent back at an odd angle
he listens to the sounds of murder inside the train car
laura screaming knife entering flesh
bloody knife thru the air
gerard leans in to take a look and steps back laughing
he yells out for bob to hear
gerard continued he continues to laugh and runs away from the train car
a few moments later leland stumbles out of the car carrying the body of laura palmer wrapped in a plastic shroud
lelands shirt is puffed out a bloody towel inside
leland bob lowers the plastic shrouded laura into the river
leland stumbles to the centre of glastonbury grove and stops
a frightening wind carries haunting music
he digs into his pockets for the pages torn from lauras secret diary
he tosses them and the bloody towel to the wind
he goes to the centre of the circle of the twelve sycamore trees
the red curtains appear and he passes between them entering the red room
it is not empty
gerard is just leaving the other side of the room
leland walks thru the red room after him
he walks down a corridor and into the red room again
there on the other side of the room leland sees gerard and the man from another place sitting side by side in a chair facing him
leland stops when he sees them
one half becomes bob opaque
the other half floats up and becomes leland transparent
he reaches up and grabs lelands wound
bob heals lelands wound
gerard and the man from another place speak in unison
subtitled in unison bob youre not going home without me
i want all my garmonbozia
corn at high tide laura palmers body is floating up to and bumping against the logs
on screen it reads annie is being brought in on a stretcher
a nurse talks to a paramedic as they rush her towards the emergency room
i dont know
sheriff truman just brought her in from glastonbury grove
the man from another place stands with cooper
is it future
or is it past
do you know who i am
i am the arm
and i sound like this
the man from another place puts his hand in front of his lips and makes an indian whooping sound
looking at the table where is the ring
someone else has it now
that would indicate that its the future
the later events have never been kept a secret
where am i
and how can i leave
you are here and there is no place to go
shouts the man from another place begins to laugh uncontrollably
a nurse mops the sweat from annies forehead
annie tries to get thru to her
my name is annie
ive been with laura and dale
the good dale is in the lodge and he cant leave
write it in your diary
the nurse pats annies forehead and takes her hand
we see teresa lauras ring on annies ring finger
the nurse gently slides the ring off annies finger
the nurse enters
with an anticipatory smile then a selfish laugh she puts the ring on her finger
doc hayward and sheriff truman watch the door of the bathroom anxiously
cooper are you alright
not getting any response truman breaks open the door
cooper in his pajamas lies on the floor
the mirror above the sink is shattered with blood all over it and the sink
cooper smiles up at them strangely
smiling strangely i slipped and hit my head on the mirror
the glass broke as it struck my head
laughs it struck me as funny harry
do you understand me harry it struck me as funny
you are going right back to bed
doc and truman help cooper up
but i havent brushed my teeth yet
cooper smiles at the uneasy pair
laura is sitting in a chair
as the end credits begin
we move back to see that laura is sitting in coopers lap in the same chair
