wet clicking sounds
a beam of purplish ultra violet light reveals a mosaic of moving forms
they skitter restlessly under the beams intensity
series of shots the uv beam passing over various parts of the space
pipe webs walls girders all covered with the insects
thousands of them
innards of steel
a vast maze of tunnels
a group of figures advances through the tunnels with handheld uv lamps
the figures are dressed in gray air tight neoprene suits their faces hidden by skin tight masks and bug like night vision goggles
in the dense silence respirator valves hiss click at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm
the scene has a dream like choreographed quality
eerie aquatic green
the horde of insects appear to be some kind of sea life crawling over the floor of a dead ocean
from their midst appears another figure its neoprene suit a flat white
female clearly the team leader
she carries a stainless steel container filled with twenty small compartments each bearing a large heavy shelled roach with a different barcode on their back
she kneels and opens the tchk
a dozen of the judas roaches are released
they slide through into the area
in a rustle of tiny legs they begin to stream toward the judases
jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them
they even crawl over the team leader in an effort to reach the judases
the team leader makes no effort to brush them off
patient almost godlike she watches the mating
a manhole has been opened above
chains are dropped down and attached by a team member to a gallon disposal drum
reveal the floor of the tunnel carpeted with the still forms of the roaches now all dead
the team members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other disposal drums
at their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre the bar coded judas roaches
in a crunch of machinery the first disposal drum is lifted by the chains through the manhole to midtown manhattan
a cacophony of sound and light
dirty snow drifts over bryant park
emergency lights blink everywhere
a wall of cars sits on sixth avenue stopped dead
exhaust fumes hang in the air
jaded traffic cops send the cars on crosstown detours
mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near dozens of department of public health vehicles angle parked in a military phalanx
a monumental ribcage like scaffolding has been erected in the middle of the street sealing the area with amber plastic
inside uniformed workers take the disposal drum of roaches and toss it into one of a number of huge dumpsters
the team leader watches from nearby exhauster
her mask is off
we see her face enthomologist susan wyeth
an arm gently drapes over her shoulder
how we doing
she looks over at dr
peter tyler bespectacled
a headset around his neck a coat emblazoned with the department of health logo
he has the look of a man whos just fought a long battle and come out victorious
he offers her a bite of a pay day candybar
susan smiles shakes her head
she wearily leans against him
peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised by mechanical arms into the waiting maw of the dump truck
a voice a somber bas relief in the darkness
stricklers disease crept into manhattan like a thief in the night claiming its first hundred victims before it was even classified
we float through a long hospital ward
past rows of illuminated oxygen tents pulsating softly in the dark like cocoons of light
most were children under ten
track past tents
bodies of small children inside wrapped in white sheets hooked up to ivs or breathing apparatus
skeletal hands parched lips glazed eyes
bellows of respirators push in and out labored failing
pull back to reveal a number of screens each with a different set of images
we are in a news van
a technician and director sit watching
the voice belongs to an anchorman whos now overimposed
only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection
cut to three
the technician manipulates the controls
on another screen we see them cut to stock news footage regular cockroaches crawling on garbage
the common cockroach
to a runner tell them were ready for a live feed
the runner exits the news van
other such vehicles parked nearby
a crowd of onlookers reporters and a gaggle of protesters with handpainted signs
gliding past them we pick up sound bites
an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control
the announcement by the health department that an end to the nightmare has finally
reporter is interviewing a greenpeace protester who is holding up a photograph of susan
an ex colleague of doctor susan wyeth
susan has always been opposed to biological tampering
a real advocate for ecological causes its not
move past them to further inside of the perimeter
a news conference in progress
a packed house
monitors spaced ever seats or so
in the audience the mayor of new york and various city officials listening to peter speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of a public servant still untainted
while peter talks a news title appears at the bottom of the screen peter tyler
deputy director department of health
wrapping up in nature evolution is a long leisurely conversation between an organism and its environment
we however did not have the luxury of time
susan is waiting in the wings
she observes the audience
she notices that the entire front row is composed of children who have survived stricklers
leg and arm braces facial scarring
he nods at susan who takes the podium adjusting her jacket slightly ill at ease in her business suit
she clears her throat speaks softly
with the aid of genetic labs throughout the country we recombined cockroach dna with genetic information from termites and mantids
we were able to create a biological counter agent
a new ally if you will
she places a clear container on the podium for all to see
one of the judas roaches skitters about in the container
the judas roach
murmurs from the audience
the judas is a non carrier of stricklers with a short life span and heightened pheromone emission
on the back row she can see some ecological hand painted signs being raised in silent protest
she stumbles for a second then resumes her speech
the female is basically a sexual magnet common males travelled miles and fought for the right to mate with them
the audience is rapt
when they did they took away something else we added a hormone passed through sexual congress that causes their metabolism to go into overdrive
no matter what their food intake they starved to death in a matter of hours
now peter takes the mic
weve achieved almost total eradication of the roach population
as of today the disease has been officially contained
a standing ovation starts and is carried on as we
in a tub in a dark bathroom
her business suit crumpled on the bathroom floor
sound of a tv outside
sus come on
youre missing it
peter in his shorts at a tv with shitty reception
he adjusts the disgruntled cable box
he is seen over the tv giving his address
i hope someones taping this
susan come on
its really good this time
i got most of the lines out
he picks up an open bottle of champagne and two mis matched ceramic cups then heads for the bathroom
lifes a bitch
our minutes came and went and all we got was bad cable
susan doesnt answer clearly not in the same high spirits
hiding from the hard glare of publicity
he notices her crumpled garment on the floor
he picks it up puts it up on the hanger
you looked great tonight
he sits by the tub
do you think we did the right thing
taking a cab instead of hiring a limo
you know what i mean
peter pours some champagne into the cups
we did no impact evaluation
the consequences of
sighs is this a catholic guilt thing
we hear a newsreader on the tv
a flawless strategy which has stopped a potential epidemic in its tracks
you hear that
we just dont know
he offers one cup to susan
she doesnt take it
we know we saved lives
he sits closer to her
therere gonna be a lot of kids running around next year because of you
susan starts to relax
he kisses her
we get lucky maybe a couple of emll be ours
smiling now were down to a couple now huh
she pats the water beckoning
oh i dont know
people are beginning to talk about us
still partially clothed he steps into the bathtub
susan shakes her head laughs ruefully
dont worry ill save your honor
maybe ill even marry you
she reaches over kisses him
the williamsburg bridge dimly visible through the rain
traffic lights blinking on empty streets
everything seems doomed under the heavy layer of rain
a dilapidated building before us
a blazing neon cross made of the words jesus saves hangs askew from its facade
crane to see the rooftop
the door to the interior stairs flies open and a tall thin chinese preacher in his sixties lurches out eyes wild with terror
he looks back down the steps
somethings climbing up fast casting ominous complex shadows on the wall
too many footsteps for it to be just one person
the man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home
trembling he backs away as a booming thud makes the door shudder
raw frenzied pounding and scratching follows
something inhuman determined to break through
the metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges
on the mans white undershirt a blotch of blood starts to grow
needles of rain stab his flesh
he searches wildly for a possible escape
he reaches the edge of the roof its five floors down to the sidewalk
two of the hinges on the door come loose pulverizing the surrounding concrete
the door to the stairs bulges outward as something smashes against it again and again
the man sprints to the other end of the roof
there on the adjoining building
just one floor below on the building across the alley is a suspended painters platform crowded with paint cans under a tarp
a two story old eyewear advertisement from the s is being painted over
looks back to the door
a tremendous shattering sound
light spills from inside
two bolts fly in the air a hinge gives
he cries out in terror
the man gauges the distance between buildings can he make it
he takes a few steps back a few more
panting hard he closes his eyes his chest soaked in blood and rain
light from inside projects the shadow of wild busy things onto the curtain of rain
weeping with fear the man desperately tries to hurl himself to the catwalk
its too far
he hits the platform knocking boards loose and sending paint cans onto their sides rolling
he bounces slides off the edge barely able to grab onto a loose board to save himself from falling
the rain blasts down
the scaffold creaks
he hits the edge upsetting the cans of paint there
he holds onto the planks with all his might trying to push with his feet but they slide on the wet wall
cans bounce off the pavement
white pain blasts all over
the mans hands slip on the planks tiring
the chinese preachers feet bicycle in the air unable to find a purchase on the wet brick wall is hanging just in front of the painted eye of the forties
he looks up above him sees something no
please god no
a shadow crosses his face as something looms above him
suddenly there is a crack and the platform tilts completely on one end
the chinese preachers fingernails dig in then slip on the wet wood
his hands paw the air
for a moment his body silhouetted in the rain seems suspended in a void
then he falls backwards
his body cracks the pavement
small pools of rain form on his dead open eyes
we crane to reveal chuy a young latino boy
he stares out the window at the chinese preachers body with no discernable emotion
he works a small wire sculpture in his hands
its a small one bedroom apartment
an old man sleeps peacefully on a cot chuys grandfather
manny gaviola mid s white hair haloes his handsome benign face
all around him shoes shoes everywhere you look on the table on the chairs on the kitchen counter on the floor
a small altar is illuminated by votive candles
next to it standing by the window is we see a blurry vision of the chinese preachers splayed figure in a swirl of color
chuys attention focuses on the preachers shoes
a whisper oxfords
he looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the wire into shape
around the preacher reflects large shadows moving above and across the neon sign
hears a strange sound a rhythmic clicking
his head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to change there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in his eyes
we are behind whatever it is that has captured chuys attention
the strange clicking sound grows louder
the figure begins moving in some weird preparatory fashion
then it steps forward and drops out of frame
his eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow arc
chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get a better view
the chinese preachers body is now being dragged toward the rear of the alley leaving colored paint smears in its wake
we isolate the boys face and on the soundtrack every other noise fades away
chuy reaches for a pair of spoons nearby
he begins to click them together
imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago
is being pulled into a small ground level vent
the only problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through this hole
watches still clicking with his spoons
one of his legs is through the hole up to the thigh but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing against the wall next to the vent
there is a silent beat and then a series of incredibly violent tugs bam
shaking the paint soaked body like a rag doll
his spoons stop
his jaw tightens a little as we hear terrible cracking and scraping sounds
the chinese preachers head and hands disappear into the hole
bits of clothing paint and blood stick to the edges of the opening
watches still fascinated
very low funny funny shoes
he starts a new wire sculpture
peter is covered in sweat running at a good clip around the central park reservoir
a beautiful day dawns behind him the windows of the beresford sparkle in the morning sun
peter outperforms most of the other runners in the track his steady rhythm evidence of years of practice
keeping his stride he runs off the track and past a flock of old nuns
excuse me ladies
without slowing down peter retakes the path and moves past them
peter finally slows down
he checks his pulse and stops at a water fountain
as he drinks he sees a derelict drawing a figure on the sidewalk
the derelict spots peter
he picks up his chalk drifts off
intrigued peter goes closer to the drawing
an arrow points to a manhole cover set among the bushes
peter circles around trying to make sense out of the lines
then the painted motif finally reveals itself
a talismanic figure of raw archetypal power
a few jagged lines form the shape of a man in an overcoat
his face is little more than a malignant blotch
a room of half finished exhibits
a group of sculptors most of them undergraduates work on a gigantic piece representing a termite mound
theyre supervised by siri a punkish young indian research assistant
susan talks to some of the sculptors about a scale clay model of an insects head
she gestures to the models mandible set
no guys these have to fit perfectly
no spaces in between
let me tell you why
insects have no hands
all they have is this set of mandibles
she grabs the outer mandible set
this little piggy will grab the prey
then unfolds a second set
then this little piggy will tear it in half
and a third
and this little one will grind it to a pulp and push it in
all the way into the mouth
these are precision tools here
can you remember that
the guys nod
then get it right
a piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads revealing
peter at the entrance still dressed in his jogging sweats
he smiles at susan
peter and susan walk through
peter pulls something from a knapsack
a bottle of medicine marked metallinin
teasing baby in a bottle
he gives it to susan
around them workmen begin unloading crates of display stuff as a man on a ladder tacks up an architects of nature banner
susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a honeycomb
peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools
you know where they get this fertility stuff
they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns
laughs monks bottle their own wine
she gently touches her belly
ive never been this late
she shakes the bottle
if nuns pee is what it takes
peters cellular rings from his knapsack
susan grabs a larvae model from a pile on the floor
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear dont forget that
dont get kinky here
peter takes the call
susan cuts away the excess plastic on the lid around the honeycomb moldings
the larvae fits perfectly inside
okay meet me out front
to susan i gotta go
joshs picking me up in five
see you tonight
ill be late
he kisses her and leaves
susan turns to siri and the group working on that sculpture
siri sandblast that thing
it looks like trump tower
those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions
a wicked smile just like trump tower then
a department of health van honks its way through a traffic jam
peters right hand man josh maslow a young good natured can do guy drives
so i say buddy you have every violation in the book
gimme one good reason not to close you down
you know what the kraut says to me
in the back peter finishes changing out of his jogging sweats and into his worksuit
try the blintzes
distractedly selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates
not just any carbohydrates mind you
it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex
honks furiously we should get a strobe on this thing
maybe even a siren
yeah and a loudspeaker so you can yell epidemic
youre all going to die
the department of health van pulls up outside the flophouse where the chinese preacher died
peter and josh get out
cops push back a few onlookers
josh proudly flashes his doh badge
the cops let them pass
you really love flashing that thing dont you
im a short guy
two cops woychek and rice approach in no real hurry
peter tyler doh
you gentlemen were the first on the scene
gestures to rice we were both on patrol saw this paint mess
then i looked through that cellar window
we both did
you gone in
peter peeks through a narrow cellar window on the floor
through the oily smeared window a ghostly array of pale face and hands appears startling him
to josh get the emts in there now
paramedic ambulances rush in
sirens at full blast
stepping out of the building across manny walks next to chuy who holds his hand
the old man carries a box full of shoes
chuy looks back at the cop circus amused
cmon chuy were gonna be late
discreetly crossing himself cops are bad news
dont look at them
he gently pulls his grandsons hand and moves briskly away
uses an iron bar and breaks a padlocked cellar door
a heavy stench emanates from inside
the cops cover their noses
peter and josh enter a dingy dungeon like cellar illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights
every door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy duty padlock
peter and josh walk through the dismal scene
in sharp contrast with the dirt smeared walls we see shiny metallic sewing machines and swatches of cloth appliqued with a funny bunny cartoon character
josh examines the label stitched into the collar
it reads jesus
his light hits a group of quivering skeletal chinese immigrants standing in a tight group against a wall
from the outside they look real sick dont they
carrying boxes full of terrarium material susan and siri ride an antiquated cage steel elevator
no floor buttons just an old fashioned hand activated lever
as long as theyre ready for the opening i dont care just tell them that
im on it
beat look susan
i dont mean to pry but
i kinda overheard you and peter
smiles ironically watch your step siri
your grant could be on the line here
well i had this cousin in delhi
she was having problems too
she used a baster
susan looks at her
not a big one
i mean it was like a turkey baster
she tries to stop the elevator at the fourth floor but it rises just a little too far
come on darlin
susan has to jimmy the lever till the elevator falls level to the floor
continues she kept it under her bed
thing is it kinda worked
i mean she had to hide it from her husband but
a pair of young boys ricky and davis sit on the floor outside susans lab door
a crumpled paper bag and a shoe box sit beside them
they been here since noon
i told them youre real busy
susan smiles at the boys who stand when they see her
you the bug lady right
smiles i suppose so
ricky raises and shakes the paper bag
were here to deal
sunlight slants in to illuminate an incredible array of live and mounted dead insects trapped in turn of the century glass fronted cabinets
davis puts his nose up against one fascinated
metaxonycha godmani trigonopelastes delta
have you been upstate
she examines the boys findings mostly rag tag specimens of battered butterflies
sadly i guess they got lost in this city
so you wanna buy em
theres extra wings in the bag
siri lingers in the background
you guys have done a nice job
how bout five dollars
dismayed thats it
to ricky show her the weirdbug
he indicates the shoebox cost a dollar just to look
its a great bug
we kinda broke it a little
siri impatiently points at the wall clock fellas ill tell you what
ten dollars for everything
plus a killing jar some tweezers and mounts so the next bunch you catch will be in better shape
thats the best
bugs almost dead anyway
susan holds out two five dollar bills
the boys cant resist
davis grabs the money thanks lady
ricky gives a last possessive look to the shoe box then follows davis out
siri crosses to the window and wrestles to close it
susan places all the kids items including the shoebox in a wastebasket
alphabet city kids theres much worse things they could be selling
siri hits the window frame with a paperweight gets it half way down
i hate this fucking window
crane to a nearby alley
a gaunt man in an overcoat stands in the shadows looking up at siri working on the window
as a streetlamp lights up he backs up into the shadows
religious slogans and posters are hung everywhere in what used to be the lobby of a mens hotel
a hand lettered sign paramedics are leading a number of ill chinese immigrants up from the cellar door seen earlier
many are brought out on stretchers
doh staff put tags on their wrists
peter examines a pale old man on a stretcher while simultaneously talking to josh
to josh theres plenty of systemic infection already so as soon as we get a preliminary reading start them on anti biotics
you saw this
peter flicks on his penlight examines the old mans eyes
one of them is completely bloodshot
then he shows josh the gums
our of have it
no definite signs of tb but well quarantine them a week just to make sure
immigrations gonna love you for that
tell them to send flowers to the usual address
peter pushes back a sheet hung across a doorway
a tiled nightmare
concentration camp cozy
a pile of old rusting sewing machines clutter the floor spilling oxide to a central grate
two shifts people rotating from bed to work
were in wal mart hell here
josh swats a fly
did they get the sleazebag who owns this place
triad chinese mafia
they bring people from yunan
eyes his notebook reverend harry wong a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them
no sign of him
an overhead door is opened
daylight streams in
peter spots yang an asian cop talking to a chinese woman lying on a stretcher which hasnt been moved yet
she is hollow eyed near death
her hand weakly hangs on to the cop as if for dear life
tell her shes going to be alright
well take care of her
peter kneels next to her looking at her and nodding while yang translates
the woman mutters again tears of fear in her eyes
yang shakes his head
keeps saying the dark angels are coming for her
she says they took some of her people away
probably a gang
chinese people man
they come up with some wacky stuff
they pull the stretcher out through the open overhead door and into an the stretcher is rolled into a waiting vehicle its lights flashing
unseen by them on a brick wall nearly buried by graffiti is a crude drawing
it is of the same odd figure peter saw drawn earlier
the susan and siri both wearing walkman headsets deftly mount butterflies and other insects onto display boards for the exhibit
rain is blowing in through the half open window
their movements are precise and lyrical the colors and designs of the insects are beautiful
we understand how you can get lost in this world
susan works steadily a partially eaten pay day bar and the wrappers of several others are evidence of her dinner
a pager goes off in susans lab coat
she takes off her headset classical music leaks from her headphones
on the pagers lcd screen the message reads late susan puts the pager down
goes to close the window
there is a loud angry buzzing sound
siri pulls her headset off heavy metal music leaks from her headphones
the buzzing sound again
we pan across the various bugs and mounting implements till we come to rest
on the shoebox the boys gave susan
something rattles wildly inside
susan crosses to the trash bin picks the box out
it vibrates on her hand then becomes quiet something moves inside
she slowly opens the lid
the bottom of the box is littered with two inches of shredded newspaper
crumbs of bread and some rice krispies can be spotted here and there a kids idea of a comfy critters nest
she moves her free hand closer
to siri can you
suddenly and insect big as her hand springs out of the shredded paper nest and tries to grab on to her
minute pieces of paper fly through the air
susan slaps the lid back down
a scared whisper could you
siri comes over as susan grabs steel tongs and a cork dissecting board
im gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down okay
what is it
i have no idea
are you ready
siri nods pins in hand
susan opens the lid and grabs the nymph with the tongs
the creature goes berserk flailing its spindly limbs buzzing and croaking a milky substance foaming out of its body
oh my god
susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard
siri tries to get a hold of it but it twists out of the tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand
a spider trapping a sparrow
it bites her hand between index and forefinger
susan pins the insect into the corkboard
it spins furiously like a crazy lp record
susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs
siri uses more pins to secure it down
noticing siris hand it bit you
leans to get a closer look at the nymph deep dark brown flat as a pancake one rear leg broken lower tail smashed
it squirms helplessly now looking pitiful under the harsh overhead light
this wing configuration
looking at her injury fuck
it broke the skin
and theyre not fully developed
this things not even an adult
the nymph continues to hiss and foam struggling against the steel pins
susan looks closely at the insects belly
susan gestures to look
siri stares down at where a set of valves on its underside click in and out
shakes her head
picks up a scalpel help me get a sample
susan touches her scalpel to the nymphs leg
the nymph clicks nervously
hold on big guy hold on
she traps the nymph down and cuts the leg off
a painful agonized buzz echoes around the room
susan attaches the insects leg to a samll holder
it is frozen in a swirl of dry ice
the brittle leg is then mounted in a laser microtome
bit by bit the machine executes microscopic wafer cuts
siri is making slides out of each section
a series of microphotographic images flash onto the screen
in the background we hear the high pitched buzz we see the lights from the mounting room through a glass brick wall
we see the nymph slowly squirming in the fg then rack focus to the rain spattered window
suddenly the overcoat man is standing on the windowsill
the window is lifted effortlesly from the outside
prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear slide
reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving across the room
seen only through rippled glass and reflections moves through the lab
his body steams lightly from the rain
his movements are quirky spastic
the man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity
he comes to the nymph pinned and mutilated on the worktable
the nymph clicks and chitters excitedly as if communicating with the man
he looks up at the worklight
it seems to bother him
in a blur of motion he smashes the light bulb
watches the smear slide
the blue droplets begin to change color once in contact with the leg section
hold on a second
slowly turning a deep green
then three large beetles fly into the room
siri looks at susan
susan gets up hesitant signals for siri to stay
we follow susan into the mounting room
she walks in barely able to see her hand in front of her face
the window facing the street is wide open rain blowing in
something crunches under her feet
she bends down looks
shes stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb
the floor is alive with various insects crawling hopping flying away from their displays which have been opened
the nymph is gone from the board
she looks under the work table the nymph was on
we lower as we track back with her
something is folded up in the corner of the ceiling behind her camouflaged in the shadows clinging impossibly to the wall
he lowers himself with silent grace
susan gasps startled
we shift to see siri at the door
the last doh van takes off under the heavy rain
across the street chuy looks down from his apartment window
chuy sits at the window twisting wire into a human like figure
moving past him we see a group of other wire figures on the table backs of chairs lamps everywhere
manny sits at the kitchen table
he ignites a can of shoe polish with a match then lights a cigarette off the flame
he puts the cigarette in his mouth and proceeds to polish a pair of shoes
a silly show plays over the tv
not too little not too much
you rub it in around and around like this
let the leather take it
manny leans tiredly against the table
he looks fatigued and in pain
he takes a small pill and places it under his tongue
you should learn to work the shoes
youre good with your hands
manny shoots a glance over to his grandson
you gonna get all wet
chuy doesnt pay attention just stares out at the street
did you look at the story book i got you
manny lifts a brightly colored childrens book
our animal friends
can you say that chico
nothing from chuy
the building across the street
yellow doh tape at the entrance
a friend is the one you can trust
when you are with a friend no matter where in the world you are at home
a figure moves out of the shadows and totters in the rain toward the entrance
it is the overcoat man barely visible in the rain
in this city
a friend is a hard thing to find
his face shows a bit of animation
manny looks up from the book
manny comes over looks out
the figure has disappeared into the dark front of the boarded up building
no one is there
chuy doesnt respond
manny turns the boys face to his
chuy listen to me
they have jesus on the cross but that is not a holy place
chuy looks at him blankly
manny sighs he knows he doesnt
god only knows what goes on in your head eh
he pats the boy on the head then goes back to work
chuy turns back to stare at the street
van pulls up in front of a modest pre war building
josh and peter climb out
peter is reviewing a roster
josh what was immigrations countdown
josh hands peter a plastic bag with his sweat clothes and running shoes
thirty three workers
peter hands him the roster
there are thirty five listed in the reverend wongs roster
peter walks up the front steps
remember what that woman said about people being taken
check with the copsin the area
peter enters the apartment which has long since been remodeled with a nicer couch and a bigger tv with slightly better reception
he notices the dining room table is filled with yellowed files all marked judas traditor
looks around once again susan
peter comes in to find susan sitting in a chair before a dryer quietly watching laundry whirl within
regarding the laundry
thought it was my week for that
i needed to think
it was either this or the weather channel
peter walks over kisses her
he notices an open book of insect morphology on her lap
theres a full color photograph of an ootheca an insect eggcase
peter folds laundry into his her piles
this thing was the size of my fist peter
thats off the charts
so you lost a great specimen dont you get it
its more than that
peter takes a bedsheet
susan helps him fold it
you know why insects dont grow larger
because they dont have a complex respiratory system
what i saw did
it had lungs
peter walks backward with his end of the sheet
the two begin to fold it together
evolution doesnt work that fast
something pushed that thing to take the leap
we need to find another specimen
as they fold the sheet they move closer together
i did a ph test on its tarsal pads
the folding of the sheet has brought them almost face to face
susan finishes folding herself
theres only two species who match the enzymes i found
ones a leaf cutter ant in the amazon
she has his full attention now
the other we released here two years ago
a taxi cab makes a u turn and cruises on
susan ignores the yakking armenian driver as she scans the buildings and empty lots avenue b
maybe you got wrong letter uh
the cabbie looks up at a manhattan street map glued over his head on the roof of the cab
well tell you when to stop
maybe they lied to you
even if they did
thats all we have isnt it
the cab cruises past the tenement buildings nondescript stores junked cars and rubble strewn lots
it stops before a traffic light
a leering homeless guy with a greasy rag and greasier cleaning solution approaches the windshield
get away you turk
the homeless guy begins wiping smudging the windshield with his dirty rag
the driver sends him away
the light turns green
the driver accelerates turning on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by the guy
susan sees something
susan motions excitedly
the driver pulls over
susan gets out
susan rushes over removes something from the windshield wiper
a butterfly its wing pinned under the rubber flapper
she holds it in her palm then looks up at peter
susan looks around
just ahead is an empty lot surrounded by a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and performance artists
an identical butterfly perches on the edge of a board
susan and peter walk through waist high grass of a small urban wilderness
dozens of butterflies flutter around them from the weeds
if you want your money back forget it
peter and susan look up
the voice comes from a ramshackle clubhouse built of wood scraps and cardboard
we already spent it
susan walks forward
were here to deal
the door to the clubhouse swings open
a blur of subway cars goes by with an ear pulverizing sound
at the end of the platform davis untwists a wire around the busted lock of a locker room door
peter paces nervously nearby
here let me
he starts on it himself
meanwhile ricky stares at a photograph susan has given to him a ribbed tortoise brown colored eggcase
you sure you didnt see one of these
what is it
it probably had more uh weirdbugs inside
shakes his head no way
i see one of those id puke
davis opens the door with a click
a dark abandoned locker room once used for transit workers
susan and peter walk in with the boys nervous in the off limits area
it was in that corner over there
davis points to a bank of dented metal lockers
sucker was fast man
picks up a pipe
had to take it out with one a these
well take it from here
peter hands ricky some money
the boy looksdown at it slyly
make it ten an we wont tell the cops youre here
peter regards the little scam artist dryly
lets keep it at five and i wont condemn your clubhouse
peter hands him a couple of dollars more
the two boys take off
peter removes a penlight from his pocket
dust covers everything
a forest of copper tubing and pipes where the sinks used to be
inspects the floor
its littered with cheap objects chipped combs used rubbers soggy newspapers smeared heroin syringes
something shiny catches his eye
he picks it up
quietly look a broken tooth
something rustles nearby
he notices an old rotting poster on the back wall
it seems oddly textured somehow
he walks toward it
kneeling pushes aside a dented trash bin
behind it there is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors
a subway train rumbles by outside the sound echoes off the tile walls
susan forces the door back
she peeks through the opening
her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror
she starts pulling something out
at the oddly texture wall
he shines the penlight at it
and is met with a flutter of wings
moths perfectly camouflaged against the poster on the wall whiz past him
turns back to her locker
she withdraws a cheap plastic necklace from it
as she removes it it breaks
a coulpe of beads fall away
rolls under the locker
and bounce once twice thrice each time going deeper till they comes to a stop
susan peers where the beads fell
theres something under here
peter comes over kneels by her
susan takes a handful of beads and throws them at the base of the locker
camera tracks to follow one of them
it rolls all the way under
a moment later from some interior space the sound of it bouncing on cement
he shines his light inside
a highlight glints off a shell like surface
the light barely touches it
peter drops the penlight
it gets stuck in a jutting piece of concrete
peter tries to get his hand in but he cannot reach the light
it is literally inches from his fingers
let me try
my hands are smaller
she kneels and goes for it
her hand reaches for the penlight
she barely touches it
the penlight spins around
its light now illuminates
the face of a man
unseen by susan
terrifying in its doll like simplicity
in the darkness its features seem indiscernable inert almost frozen in a perfectly symmetrical pattern
it regards the spiderlike movement of susans fingers
face squinches with the effort
honey just leave it
as susans hand moves closer the strange face begins to susans hand is almost there
and suddenly a beam of light cuts through the darkness
their vision resolves
the figures of two mta cops stand before them ernest burly and bull necked and leonard african american more formidable than fat
wearily now dont tell me
susans hand withdraws
you lost a token right
shh shh shh
a felt rag is expertly being pulled across a set of pristine black shoes
reveal leonard sitting like a king in a chair getting his shoes shined by manny
he leans back laconically while arguing with peter
ernest examines the ootheca picture
look i showed you my badge
yeah and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there
thats the old maintenance grid doc
swiss cheese tunnels tracks
the department of public health
should know bettern to go sneakin around my turf
you want me to call your supervisor
hes a lonely guy
uninterested leonard looks over to susan and chuy
she leans against the wall inspects her dirty hand
ernest gives her his handkerchief
she looks down at chuy who sits nearby holding a pair of your shoes
she stares down at her shoes
gucci flat pumps all right
just then a subway train pulls up
the doors open disgorging passengers
chuy flips into action
he starts playing his spoons clicking them together slapping them against his knee
susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons to imitate the different rhythmical step patterns of the various commuters the rolling comical gait of a fat
man the lithe haughty step of a prim lady
what grade are you in
chuy doesnt answer
shoesre all chuy knows about
ernest discreetly points to his forehead
immediately hes special
he can imitate anything you just watch him
irritably to leonard excuse me im talking to you
no you talkin at me
leonard hands manny a
bill for the shine gets up and walks past peter as if he were invisible
discreetly to susan is there some reward for this
i guess that could be arranged
ernest smiles pockets the ootheca picture
you gonna lay a two bit bureaucratic territorial number on me
you wanna keep up the conversation you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude
leonard saunters away with ernest in tow
peter shakes his head angrily
he takes susan by the arm heads off in another direction
chuy without watching clicks his spoons to the imitation of their steps
susan and peter walk up the stairs peter still fumes
you give someone a fucking uniform and
did you hear how he talked to us
i heard how you talked to him
oh so im the bad guy now
susan spares him an ironic look
he was just doing his job
fine then im the bad guy
at the top of the stairs theyre completely engulfed by sunlight
he wants a permit ill get him a permit
a train blurs by
a flashlight beam over dirty gravel
tilt with the beam to see ernest walking his beat past tracks and girders
hulking out of service subway cars surround him
he shines his light on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls
a sound catches his attention
he notices something off to a corner walks over to it
a shiny brown lump in the corner covered in garbage
he touches the lump with his shoe
it stirs slightly
he touches it again
and a pair of legs suddenly lash out kicking at him reflexively
ernest jumps back
another set of legs emerges
oddly enough ernest relaxes
he grabs the surface of the lump and pulls it
we see that it was just a shiny brown tarp
underneath a group of three homeless people emaciated toothless sleeping intertwined for warmth
in the dim light they almost seem like a single organism
the homeless people stare back at him mutely
ernest starts getting annoyed
i told you to stick by the maintenance area
its private property now
ernest looks at her confused
he eats down there
the homeless man points
ernest turns his light
another silhouette of the overcoat man drawn on the wall
an arrow below it points east
graffiti artist uh
to homeless people look guys just get off my beat you hear
ernest hustles them out
the homeless people glare at him pick up their things and head into the gloom
ernest watches them go
he turns back to the graffiti painting of the stickman
ernest walks deeper into the tunnels
dusklight slants in weakly from grates above
he stops as a rumble is heard ahead of him he ducks into a recess in the wall
the rumble grows louder louder
a subway train curves around the bend up ahead its headlights raking the opposite wall to reveal
a figure crouched over something
we hear chomping and swallowing sounds
squinting to see over his flashlight beam
just the wet sounds of food getting chewed and ingested
ernest is revolted
get off my track
the crouching figure lifts its head and looks around in a unusually quick blur of motion
its the overcoat man
another distant rumble
ernests clothes flutter in the puff of hot wind that signals an approaching train
ernest pulls a can of mace from his belt begins to advance
the overcoat man stands up
ernest stops in his tracks
for he sees that the overcoat man is holding a large object in his arms
something wet and shiny with blood
a dead dog
the overcoat man drops the animal
it rolls slowly down his chest
and is briefly caught by another set of arms extending sweet jesus
the overcoat man lets the animal fall to the ground
he begins walking toward ernest
ernest backs away
the overcoat man leaps on him just as the subway train roars crack
ernests body is twisted and crunched by powerful arms
through the strobing windows we see ernest enveloped by the dark figure then raised above taken away
the can of mace rolls next to the track as the train clears
the track is empty again
we pan across the banner architects of nature
exhibits under glass set up throughout the room insect chambers and vaults of great complexity etc
an opening night crowd of affluent museum patrons
all tuxedoes and painted smiles
some peremptorily peruse the displays most just camp out at the buffet table
peter enters dressed in his worksuit
he scans the room sees siri leaning against a wall by the buffet table drinking an orange juice
he goes over to her
kisses her on the cheek
wheres the boss
siri gestures to the far end of the room
susan stands alone sipping a chardonnay by an ant mound exhibit
peter notices siri seems unusually weary
she covers one of her eyes
its just a headache
we were sandblasting trump tower here since four this morning
maybe you should sit
go talk to susan
she could use a good word right now
she nods for him to go ahead
siri closes her eyes
she rubs the bandage around the insect bite on her hand
shes staring through thr glass panes of the exhibit at the crowd of patrons
in the refraction their black tuxedoes and evening gowns seem to blend into one another
no such thing baby
she looks over at the crowd congregated around the buffet table
i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids
they dont know what theyre missing
peter looks at her
nothing that a little menopausals pee daikiri couldnt cure
least thats what i thought
peter looks at her notices that one of her hands is on her stomach
genuinely moved oh no you were i was just late
peter takes her hand
they sit by the ant mound
ironic dont you think
these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs right
and here we are
susan were not b susan
susan looks up to see siri standing on the other side of the glass case
one of her eyes is completely bloodshot
her mouth is bleeding
she puts her hand on the case to steady herself
her fingers leave a streak of blood on the glass
the exhibit tips over
peter pulls susan out of the way just as the exhibit siri
the room erupts into commotion
susan and peter run to siri who lies unconscious on the floor
peter gently turns her over
siris bleeding from the corner of her mouth
just like the chinese workers in the sweatshop
tuxedoed people encircle her next to the insect mounds
an ambulance races down the avenue toward a distant hospital
siri is rushed on a gurney toward the emergency room
peter and susan walk next to it talking to dr
chris raymond a year old er physician
i think its some kind of systemic infection chris
i saw a few cases like it yesterday
a sweatshop in canal
you better come in with me
help me through
raymond peter and several other er staff work on siri now lying on an operating table
to peter all hands on deck pete
remember the dril
itll come back to me
raymond inspects siris wounded hand
the bandage has been removed
the bite wound is infected and suppurating
a large red circular rash around it
looks like a lyme disease rash
its not consistent with the internal bleeding
any idea what bit her
peter shakes his head
i think were gonna need to have that specimen here
an assistant finishes inserting a catheter down her throat
blood and fluid leak up through the clear tube
staring down through the circular glass deck susan silently observes the procedures
salmon colored light slants in from sodium vapor streetlight
pan through the shadowy room past mannys sleeping form to chuy asleep under a tent made of an old star wars blanket
a rhythmical clicking sound is heard from outside
chuy pops his head out from under the blanket listening
wearing only his pajama bottoms chuy steps out on the fire escape with his spoons in hand
the clicking resumes from the building across the street
the barefoot little boy crosses the street steps through the center of the huge paint stain on the sidewalk
the clicking sound comes again
the clicking comes again from inside the flophouse
it continues a little bit then stops
chuy clicks his spoons together mimicking the sound
a clicking from within again almost an answer
chuy ducks under the yellow doh tape walks toward the front of the building
he comes to the boarded entrance
there is a hole narrow and low in the doorway
chuy squats begins to wriggle through it
chuy steps into the lobby
the clicking comes again from further inside
chuy moves to find it
bits of streetlight slant in
chuy walks slowly listening
he steps into the shadow of a looming figure
we start on bleeding nail pierced feet then tilt up the twisted body to the face of jesus looking down
stares without emotion at the plaster figure
movement to his side
he turns again
a dimly lit figure stands before him
shapes fold and regroup in the darkness resolving into the tall figure of the overcoat man
the man begins to emit the clicking noise from under his chin his whole head vibrating
he has a beautiful smile
he plays his spoons imitating the sound the figure made
he is answered
but this time its from the other side of the room
we pan as he turns
another overcoat man appears in the shadows
chuy giggles delighted
susan and peter
you dont even know what youre looking for
you said that thing was big as your hand
i dont think im going to miss
why take the chance
just let me go down there with you
susan glares at him
peter sits down by her
susan listen to me you handled that insect almost as much as siri
it didnt bite me
but if it was carrying something
theres a chance you could have been exposed
susan is silent
chris is going to run some blood tests on you
i want you to stay here till hes absolutely sure youre clean
then youll call me
youll catch up with us
susan looks up at him
finally she nods
well be all right sus
he leans over kisses her gently
but susan seems hardly reassured
the blue hours before dawn
laconic movement outside
new york dragging itself out of bed
we find manny fixing some melted cheese sandwiches on a hot plate
he addresses chuys tented bed behind him
my father saw me stay in bed hed go get a pitcher
cold water whoosh i tell you thats some alarm clock brrrrr
manny cuts the bread in four equal sections and arranges them in a star shaped pattern
a breakfast ritual of some kind
there you go
the way you like em chu chu
he pours a glass of milk
were low on milk you remind grampa to pick some up tonight okay
he walks over to chuys tent bed
he pulls the sheets aside
his grandson is gone
sewage water bubbles in huge tanks
a workman walks down catwalks above the tank disengaging the larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling hooks
shoes tires rags
a grinding sound is heard
the workman yells out to a control booth above
we gotta block on filter d
sound of the pump coming to a halt
the workman walks to the filter area
he sinks his grappling hook into the polluted waters
the grappling hook moves like a scythe to the filter
past long soft filaments of ragged tissue
and connects with a larger form
the workman feels the grappling hook connecting
he gives a yank hooking whatever it is
he begins pulling it up
a pale form bubbles to the surface
the workmans face goes pale
a grating voice from the control booth is heard over the p
whats the problem
it take the workman a moment to speak
i think its a baby
the workman pulls the form as if that will do any good toward the edge of the tank
he bends down and now gets his first good look at it
the workman screams
his grappling hook falls from his hand into the sewage
susan watches siri from behind a pane of glass
siri is connected to a respirator her vital signs monitored by several machines
raymond approaches susan two cups of coffee in his hands
how you feeling
you tell me
he smiles gives her one of the cups
your blood tests were all negative
you checked out
susan visibly relaxes
she looks back at the icu ward
what about siri
i dont think theres any immediate danger but well have to keep her under observation
you think its some form of stricklers dont you
pathologys still working on the tissue samples
if it is
it must be an errant strain
shorter incubation period
im sorry sue
we just dont know yet
at the sink susan runs water over her hands her face trying to collect herself
she looks up in the mirror
we see that her eyes are swollen tear stained
she walks out of the ladies room drying her face with a paper towel
sounds of a nearby argument catch her attention
how many times i gotta tell you man we cant accept this
well what the hell else am i suppose to do with it
susan heads in the direction of the voices
an orderly jeremy argues with an emt
their point of contention a small form lying on a stretcher
take it out back and throw it in the friggin dumpster
not unless somebody signs for it
susan walks toward them catches sight of the tiny form
her eyes go wide
oh my god
jeremy notices her
hey you cant
whats your name
go get dr
chris raymond will you
did you hear me
but if her tone wasnt enough the stare she gives him certainly is
jeremy backs away takes off down the hall
susan approaches the stretcher
to emt whered you find it
washed up at the filtration plant on bank street
some asshole there thought it was a baby
they called us
susan bends over it
she covers her mouth and nose at the stench
its a lobster right
but its not
what lies on the stretcher before them looks more like a demon from a brueghel painting
a three foot insect
its mephitic pink white body is rotten falling apart
the heads intact with strange large jaws thrown wide open
the chitin on one is half gone
josh deposits a backpack full of equipment on the floor along with a small acrylic cage
peter trains his flashlight into the bank of lockers
leonard weary and pissed looks at his watch
better hurry it up doc
my shifts almost over
josh hands him a piece of paper
guess someone requested you for overtime
peter braces his legs and tries to push the whole bank of lockers clear the locker section tips and falls with an enormous bang which echoes loudly off the tile
dust flies everywhere
when the dust settles and flashlights are focussed on the area of the wall where the lockers stood we see a large using a steel probe susan examines the dead
posterior sternites are gone
half the protonum rotted off
raymond lifts one of the wings
a clump of white larvae feasts on the flesh underneath
thing mustve died about three weeks ago
susan closes the mandibles and examines them
do you have a polaroid
water dripping from overhead echoing footsteps very spooky
leonard leads peter and josh down the tunnel you all watch your step
we got some burrows goin down seven stories here
you fall i dont wanna have to come pick you up
whisper to peter new yorks finest
monumental archways give way to naves as big as notre dame
josh flashes the ultra violet light over an abandoned underground encampment made of cardboard walls electrical wiring elaborate debris kitchens
the walls are completely taken by layer after layer of hand carved initials and messages
everything from kilroy was here to elaborate quotations from the bible
theres really people living down here
this section was pretty popular all the way to fulton street
their flashlights shine in a haze of brown dust
the air is heavy
substance abusers mental cases
then about a year ago poof
rumors got started
someone found a couple of stiffs
they work their way down a steep incline
theyre covered in sweat
down heres the land of talk see
so the wildest version goes the farthest
they mark that area with a sign or a drawing and its as good as closed
chuckles we had one fella
for years said he was bela lugosi
got him on geraldo
peters cellular rings
he picks up big static susans got the phone up on her shoulder clamped against her ear
raymonds cranking out a bunch of polaroids
color shots of the insect from every angle
can you hear me
phone barely audible yeah barely
we havent found anything down here
jeremy goes to the fridge for a beer
the fridge light plays over the large insects jaws
it makes out a few new ridges and valleys
raymond snaps a couple of polaroids
im on my way
ive got something for you to look at
susan notices something weird and undefinable about the contours of the claws
but she cant put her finger on it
well be back at the platform in
if you dont go sight seeing anymore
the call is lost
peter tries to change frequencies but its useless
peter replaces the phone in his pocket
he walks off
shoulda seen some track bunnies by now
theyre usually around
no one notices the overcoat man carving on the wall
on mannys dining room table a heap of unpolished shoes has accumulated
the radio is playing a sad elegiac tango
no no please understand
i cant wait that long
looking disheveled and tired manny clutches the phone listening intently
i write it down
what does this mean case number
so now what
when can you
he holds a color snapshot of chuy sitting on a mailbox
no i cant wait
manny slowly hangs up
he stares at his notepad at the number
hijos de puta
he crumples it up throws it away crosses to the window picks up chuys last wire figure another human looking figure long and thin but with something slightly off about
it has six limbs instead of four
frowns looks down at the dark flophouse across the street
distant thunder is heard
manny takes a straight razor from the bathroom cabinet opens the blade
susan arrives at the stairs leading down to the subway station
a couple passes her on their way up
a sign over the entrance says station will close for repairs at pm tokens only
susan looks around the area is semi deserted a bit creepy
she takes a deep breath descends
susan pushes through the turnstile enters the long corridors of gleaming tile a somewhat de humanizing atmosphere straight out of a george tooker painting
susans footsteps echo in the empty tunnel
she sneaks a nervous glance over her shoulder nobody is following her susan observes the locker room door impatiently
a small crew of repairmen are dismantling a row of fluorescent lights
she sits and waits
peter josh and leonard walk through a darker area
the floor beneath them suddenly changes becomes tile
sniffing smells like acid
peter stops looks around
josh walks to the right where the smell seems to emanate from
at last they come to josh lights a flare sets it on the ground walks ahead
the ominous rumble of a subway is heard in the distance
a cracked water main above
water dribbles to the ground
theres some weird shit here
take a look
leonard shines his flashlight ahead
revealed quite literally is a world of shit
large feces scattered everywhere on the floor hanging sausage like from the ceiling
one can almost taste the stench of old ammonia
peter puts on a rubber glove inspects one of the fecal stalactites
fecal matter unknown origin weird shit
beat whatever it is its not human
josh breaks off a sample drops it in a jar with a hard thunk
leonard turns away in distaste
and it needs some metamucil
its raining like hell
manny approaches the abandoned flophouse
he peeks through the boarded up front entrance
right there on the dusty lobby floor clearer than the larger shoeprints
he discovers a trail of tiny barefoot prints
he kicks experimentally at the planks but theyre far too strong
manny explores the opposite face of the building looking for a way in
a dog is barking incessantly
something moves in the shadows
something long and thin haloed by the rain
it moves again the streetlight touching it for a fleeting moment as it totters around to the rear of the building
its the overcoat man
the man hurries past
manny sprints after him
manny comes running around a pile of grocery crates
there is the overcoat man
cargo workers mill around a group of vegetable trucks unloading produce
the overcoat man attracts no attention
keeping his head down staying near the shadowed buildings
jumping and hopping he skitters into an alley
manny has to trot to keep up with the mysterious figure
he pauses to take a pill and place it under his tongue
once it takes effect he moves on
the overcoat man has moved past a chainlink fence
its too high
the old man squeezes through a jagged opening
the metal fabric cuts his shirt
on the other side a dead end
nowhere to go except for
manny lifts it
manny lands on his feet with considerable difficulty
he flicks his lighter flame and opens the straight razor
this pipe is carpeted with trash and a thick crust of dirt
something moves under a wet newspaper a thick mass of long legged spiders dissolve onto the walls and floor
the distant sound of spoons playing
manny pulls a rosary from his pocket wraps it around his wrist and crosses himself with the razor
then begins to move down the pipe
susan examines the polaroids
she pulls out a payday bar
the crew of repairmen are leaving
hey lady all power will be down in five minutes okay
she munches on the bar
she stops one snapshot has caught her attention
the fridge light illuminated this photograph
susan turns it around
trying to find something different in the lines
a train roars by
then she notices it the closed jaws
they look like a human face
gets up nervously and heads for the dor to the locker room
a whole row of lamps goes off
the rest flickers in and out
then we see now standing on her platform the overcoat man
he looks at her between a row of columns under the dead neon lights
susan tries the locker room door
carefully crosses the floor to the bank of lockers
she kneels to examine the hole in the wall
she nears a noise
the overcoat man is moving toward her
the mans face tips back
raising the complex glittering insect head from behind its multi parted mouth clicks open
the thing charges its coat opening to reveal
six leathery wings fully extended
the wingspan blocks the whole tunnel they vibrate rapidly
susan tries to run but the creature hereafter known simply as the mimic leaps onto her chest
shes dragged screaming into the hole
their silhouettes recede rapidly amidst a confusion of legs wings and pipes
peter and josh put the fecal samples into the back pack
leonard stands at the other end of the area
he inspects some old scaffolding set up at an opening which leads to fifteen feet below
ive never been this deep
this area here is the old armory station
they built it in the s
ran out of money half way through
its like grand centrals dead little brother
tiled mosaic walls columns monumental arches
spaces for shops
a group of abandoned turn of the century subway cars on parallel tracks
okay the fat ladys singing
time to go
everything is gray with dust
to josh i want a team in here by six tonight hands and knees with toothpicks
leonard squints down at the planks of the scaffolding
a nymph big as the one seen earlier emerges from a pile of nearby feces as if it were part of the mound
keeping his eyes fixed on the insect leonard coolly bends down picks up a rock
putting the last sample boxes into the back pack looks up and sees step onto the scaffolding raising the rock to crush the nymph
leonard tosses the rock at the insect crushing it
peter rushes to the insects corpse on the scaffolding
did you see the size of that thing
look what you did
you stupid sonofa a creak from the scaffolding at their combined weight
leonard grabs peter tries to pull him from the scaffolding
taking peter and leonard with it
both peter and leonard are thrown to the ground of the station below
the scaffolding falls around them
stir in the wreckage
peter rises shakily
he puts his glasses on
one of the lenses is badly smashed
im all right
he tries to help leonard up leonard knocks his hand away
get the hell away from me
peter looks up at josh
deadpan hes all right too
leonard brushes himself off checks out his walkie talkie
its been broken in the fall a tangle of plastic and wires
he curses under his breath
peter checks the wall for a handhold
but theres only smooth tile and dust
oh thats gonna work
you got a better way up
leonard removes his badge tosses it up to josh
show that to the station manager
tell him leonards gonna have his bubble butt he dont have someone down here in ten
h how do i get
way we came
take the first tunnel to your right
leonards voice echoes off the cavernous walls
josh hurriedly writes it down in his notebook
go left again till you hit the fork
then right again
you got that
i think so
one right two lefts
and a right
we hear a persistent beeping
a concrete room filled with glimmering debris
cans eyeglasses fake teeth chrome foil glass shards broken watches
susan lies unconscious half sunk in a mulch of decomposing food old newspapers plastic garbage bags
an inch of brown water burbles past her bloody head
something jostles her rocking her back and forth
her eyelids slowly open
its wingcase is drooped around her like a shroud
the creature furiously tears at her jacket trying to get at susans beeper
the beeper spills from her pocket along with several pay day bars
the mimic crushes the machine instantly then chomps up all the candy bars with a single move of its mandibles
susan watches in terror as the creature steps away
a sound from an adjacent tunnel
and sees another mimic pulling the remains of a man into the darkness
susan gropes around her in the soggy debris looking for some weapon
her fingers close around a three foot piece of rusty pipe
something dark drips on her hand
above her a badly decomposing human foot or what is left of it
all part of the excarnated corpse of the chinese preacher
his gold cross shines boldly in the dark
hears the sound
it immediately skitters back to her
jerks herself sideways
and stabs the pipe into the mimics thorax with a wet crrk
susan heaves herself up pushing the thing onto its back
the mimic buzzes furiously milky white foam pumping from the wound
its legs slash the air as it tries to right itself
susan runs for the tunnels debris falling from her clothing
comes to a t junction
he checks his notepad for the appropriate direction
he turns heads left
susan staggers through a dark passageway
water drizzles into her grimy face
she looks up
rain leaks from an overhead grate three stories up
she can see the shoes of people walking to and fro above
life as usual on delancey street
pedestrians crisscross the metal grate hunched under their umbrellas
traffic noise t
displays on street front stores boom boxes car horns
they drown out the tiny sound of susans voice
hears distant feet scurrying toward her punctuated by a metallic clang
the metal pipe still imbedded in the mimic bangs the wall as the insect moves down the dripping narrow tunnel
looks around frantically
she crosses to a metal lid on the floor lifts it
a hole is below dropping off into darkness
the mimics clanging grows louder
susan sits herself on the edge of the hole grasping the metal lid by handles on its underside
the mimic rushes into the chamber speeding toward her
susan jumps into the hole hanging onto the lid
the lid slams shut over the hole a fraction of a second before the creature reaches it
the mimic touches the lid with its antennae confused
the tick ticking of the mimics antennae scanning the lid
susan hangs from the handles on the lid her arms trembling
susans strength gives out
she lets go falls
susan crashes onto a juncture between two large pipes
she moans in pain
secures her position looks down
a seemingly bottomless pit below crisscrossed with a forest of pipes and ducts
the nearest pipe above her is well beyond reach
she is trapped
then she hears the sound of the lid opening above
she holds her breath
a faint yellow light of a lighter flickers down at her
josh cautiously enters a vaulted area
old pipes have been ripped from the walls
water gushes over the steel plated walls
he looks around this doesnt seem familiar
josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal plate on the wall
he yanks at the plate it gives a little bit
he yanks harder the plate falls down on one side hanging precariously from a loose bolt
it reveals a hole packed with dozens and dozens of oothecas
he leans close to examine them there is a noise in the tunnel behind him a curtain of water falls over the side of a pipe onto the floor
behind it something enormous crawls into view
multiple legs antennae an elongated body distorted by the water and the light of a flare
it stops holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways never taking his eyes off the thing josh begins to move away
he sees a narrow opening in the wall there seems to be dim light coming from something beyond it
he tries to squeeze through the opening the creature is immobile behind the sheet of water as if mesmerized by its flow with tremendous effort josh passes through the opening
he finds himself inside a bowl shaped mud hole
scattered around him he sees funny bunny patches that were sewn in the sweatshop
he trips on a half buried sewing machine
he looks up above him is a grate
hes come to the shower room of the sweatshop
empty now except for the rusting sewing machines in a corner
we tilt to see josh moving the grate away
he jumps no way he can grab onto the slippery tile josh puts the old sewing machine upright
suddenly the bolt hinging the plate gives way and
the steel plate hits the ground klangg
leaps into action
hears the clicking fairly close
he shines his light back down the hole he entered through moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed
oh shit oh shit oh shit
he stands on top of the sewing machine wobbling reaches for the floor above joshs head and one shoulder are in through the hole
his arms tremble
he makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab the power cord of one of the abandoned sewing machines
rushes through the opening without even slowing down
pulls himself up up wham
the mimic hits the lower part of his body blood spraying up through the hole
he screams grasps the cord with both hands
he is brutally yanked down into the hole the sewing machine tipping then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges violently in the hole
we track over to reveal one of chuys perfectly executed wire sculptures
sitting atop another sewing machine
a ring of flares burns in the darkness like an island
peter lights another one revealing a space buried in layers of dust and time
cracked mannequin faces stares out from an unopened tailor shop
a flower parlor decorated with cobwebs
a yellowed newspaper on the floor its headlines reading german troops peter looks up to see leonard approaching from the track
theres an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks
aint gonna be much use though
lines are dead
peter shines his flare up at a thick cord of cables which hum ominously with electricity
you said those cablesre still live
cant we rewire
oh man there you go again
those things bring juice to the new stations
you just cant rewire that shit
peter approaches him
for chrissakes whats the problem
you need a memo every time you fart
all right motherfucker thats it
he pushes peter violently
their eyes lock and meet
inches away from a fistfight
a sound rushing towards them its echoes increasing by the second
where is it coming from
peter looks at leonard
leonard unbuttons his holster clip places his hand on his
a shadow appears outside the archway
it steps onto the platform
the old man stumbles out of the darkness out of breath
a rusted crowbar in his hand
leonard walks over to him solicitously
my god what the hell are you
hurry the woman needs help
a shadow crosses peters face
outstretched hands in the darkness
reveal peter leaning across the void with one hand while manny and leonard grip his other
susan below balancing precariously on the crisscrossing pipes
a mess but still alive
she reaches up to peter
its too far
a whisper dont
listen to me were getting you out
leonard and manny pull peter back into peter undoes his belt
to manny and leonard give me your belts
peter buckles them together with his
he then loops one end around a bannister the other around his wrist
to manny as he ties them together what are you doing down here
he was taken
hes down here somewhere
to peter oh please hurry
i saw what was after her
peter takes his word for it
he uses the belts to lower himself to the nearest pipe
leonard lights a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery
peter works his way down
the web of pipes seem to recede into hades
the lifeline tightens
peter gets to the last solid footing lies down on his stomach and lets the belts down
im coming sus im coming
but then he sees something move below her
then a hollow no jesus no
to leonard toss the flare down
i only got
just do it
leonard lets the flare drop from his hand
it falls past them ricocheting off the maze of pipes spinning down to the pitch black below
and for a split second the flame illuminates
pipe in its thorax nimbly climbing the pipes toward susan eyes grow huge
just plain loses it
what the fuck is that
what the fuck is that
knows all too well whats coming for her
a desperate appeal peter
throwing caution to the wind peter reaches the belt down
wrap it around your hand
susan at last gets a grip
peter pulls with both arms
susan struggles for footholds on the slippery pipes ascending foot by foot
peter pulls her into his arms
peter bends down
get on my shoulders
susan steps onto his shoulders
he pushes her up
and leonard and manny yank her out
peter scrambles up slams the lid back on the hole
the four of them run
hold on the lid
it bursts from the floor rolls away like a coin
the four humans run down the empty platform
peter spares a look back
far down the tunnel there
he points to the open door of an ancient subway car
they sprint for the car get to the door
manny peter leonard then susan
tumble inside a repair car crammed with shelves and empty crates
get the goddam door
leonard and peter both grab its handle slide it shut
the mimic crashes into it
the door bulges out from the impact almost tearing itself off the hinges
susan jumps back
manny runs to cover her
the creature is caught half in half out antennae and forelegs waving wildly
the abdomen crashes through a pane of glass
dont let up
leonard and peter push harder barely keeping it pinned
white blood spatters everywhere
the mimic is now cut in the wings flap wildly the abdomen shatters the safety windows outer panels
but the front section is still alive
it scrabbles in spraying white blood
drags itself up on the ceiling then down onto the floor and under a row of shelves in a half circle around the car till it finally comes to a
the only sound is a skittering outside
susan looks outside the window
the mimics rear half is still trying to push through the door its feet blindly dragging along
what the fuck was that
peter says nothing
leonard grabs him by the shirt
you better tell me what the hells going on here
take it easy
to leonard we dont know
we dont know what it is
leonard releases peter and cocking his gun moves closer to the still thing
wait a minute fuck you wait a minute
im going to snap
the mimic pounces on him catching his leg in its front mandibles
a sickening crunch as the mimics mouth begins to work the leg like a grinder blender
peter and manny try to pull the thing off as leonard falls and writhes on the floor
the men flinch away as leonard empties his guns on it until the things shell finally cracks
but the thing is still locked onto leonards leg
peter tries to work it free from the creatures jaws
its muscles are locked
hoarse oh jesus
manny removes a can of shoe polish from his coat then starts smearing the stuff onto the mimics head and jaws
its hitting the bone man get it off
he lights a cigarette lighter goes to touch the flame to the flammable stuff
hey hey hey
is how we make loose the ticks back home
peter hesitates but lets him go
manny lights the polish
the mimics head is engulfed in a halo of flame
the peter and manny yank it free from leonard whos passed out from the pain
his leg is torn and bloody
we now see the car is s vintage
a poster of mickey mantle above an empty worktable
peter sits before susan
shes trembling understandably shaken from her previous experience
blood pours from a cut on her forehead
peter takes a bit of torn cloth puts it to the wound then tenderly raises her hand to keep the bandage in place
just keep holding it
can you do that for me
susan nods silently
her hand weakly presses the compress
he turns to manny who sits solicitously next to leonard
his wound is wrapped with makeshift bandages
he begins to stir
peter gets up but susans hand is closed tightly around his like the jaws of the mimic
he kisses her gently then slowly manages to release his hand
he walks to leonard inspects his wound
touches the sole of his foot
you feel anything
yeah i feel like ripping your fucking eyes out
i need to see if theres any nerve damage before we carry you back
look im trying to help you here
oh you helped me here all right white boy
you and your goddam memo
you needed to prove your point uh
but i dont think letting you bleed to death is the best apology
peter touches his foot again
leonard finally nods
manny gazes at the mimic carcass at the end of the car
where the helld that thing come from
peter looks at susan
she remains silent
quietly a mistake
whats that supposed to
it doesnt matter all right
how you know that
shit it was runnin around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart
quietly it doesnt have a heart
peter looks up at her
just inner chambers
but it look like a man
i saw it
she gets up finally moving
thats what it wanted you to see
the subway car sits at the end of the platform windows dimly glowing in the dark
the door opens and manny and peter snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car
the lower half of the insect has been moved into the car
susan is reassembling it
so youre saying this is like those bugs that that look like twigs or leaves or
shakes her head thats camouflage
susan displays the partly charred head
this is mimicry
they evolve to mimic their predators
a butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl
a catterpillar can copy a snake
susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self contained bud shape then pushes back the face mandibles
this has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator its ever had
she holds it in her hand like yoricks skull
the mimics head obscenely mirrors her own
she inserts it into the shoulder cavity
she stands back
camera cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like mantids can mimic
we gave the judas that code
and behold he will come that walks as a man yet is not a man
this is our baby peter
yours and mine
arent you proud
we see four shadows move fast scuttling on the walls and ceiling
heading towards the car
a subway map on the wall
red blue and orange lines branching through the boroughs like veins
theyre like tunnels of an insect colony
once these things hit a certain population density theyll have to move out form new colonies
the realization hits the others
we have to get help down here
burn the tunnels before
shes interrupted by a clicking from the tunnel ahead
its answered by clicking from the tunnel behind
get the doors
a brief glimpse down the car shows too many other doors to close in time
is there a switch
third rail is dead
to manny and susan
get me up
there must be a manual override in the booth
manny and susan help leonard up
whispering to peter the lights
peter turns off the flashlights
susan and manny help leonard to the cars control booth
peter looks where the silhouette of a mimic moves to the rear of the car
leonard opens a box on the side wall marked manual override
inside there is a large hexagonal shaped hole
starts looking around wheres the damn crank
the mimic is only yards away
other shadows emerge from the distant dark
manny leaves leonard and susan to look for the lever crank
he runs to help peter try and shut the doors manually
but its useless
many of the doors wont budge
hissing a whisper theyre coming
the shadows get nearer their clicking louder
susan looks under the dashboard finds a hexagonal shaped rod
the lever crank
i got it
susan gives it to leonard
he jams the rod into the hexagonal shaped hole
leonard begins cranking the thing
but its rusty and slow
the doors begin to swing shut very slowly
sees the moving doors starts heading for them
leonard cant crank fast enough
susan joins in putting her hands over leonards
both spin the thing as fast as possible
peter and manny each pulling on a door trying to speed up the closing process
shadows are seen approaching now very close
leonard and susan put all their effort into turning the crank one more time
come on you son of a
a soft click as the doors shut in unison
all four are stock still like a submarine crew awaiting the blast of depth charges
their eyes dart to the caked with soot irradiated by the distant glow of one of the red flares
something bumps against the door
a machine gun patter of footsteps on the roof
the car shakes
the dark platform is alive with phantom shapes
something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a nail over a chalkboard
impacts on the sides
an obscene symphony of sounds as mimics lay siege to the car
a buzz of wings catches his attention
his face is reflected in a security window
the window splinters destroying peters reflection
claws scratch the ceiling
it begins to dent
large forms clicking underneath looking for a way in
susan stares at the floor her eyes following the course of the clicking
which leads to leonards wounded bloodstained leg
looks at leonard
a mimic leg pierces the ceiling above them
susan pulls leonard out of the way just in time as klang
more legs break through the ceiling
emerge from the control booth leonards arm over susans shoulder
its driving them crazy
we have to mask the odor
but theres not time enough to discuss possible solutions
leonard pulls off his jacket
susan begins wrapping it around his wound to mask it
peter has upended one shelf jamming it against a broken window as a barricade
despite their efforts the mimics are not thrown off the scent
its no use
they know were in here
they dont know anything peter they just sense
hardwired to eat anything thats not like them
the whole car is now shaking and buckling
she looks over at the severed mimic corpse nearby
to manny give me your razor
manny looks at her blankly
susan just takes the blade
the whole car is now shaking and buckling
she runs to the mimics carcass
for a moment she hesitates
but the pandemonium leaves her little choice
she slices into the mimics corpse with the razor
what are you doing
sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow
and pulls out two fat amber sacs the size of softballs
she slices them open
orange goo leaks out its stench overpowering
covers his nose shit
peter looks up as susan slides one of the sacs over to him
rub it on the windows
what just do it
holding his breath against the stench he smears the crap on the windows the doorframe
looks to the roof listening
and remarkably the sounds of the mimics start susan comes over to leonard begins dabbing the goop on leonards wound
leonard makes a face at the stink
what are you putting that crap on me for
insects use em to identify themselves to each other
she smears the floor area behind leonard
the activity winds down gradually and finally comes almost to a halt
leaning against the dirtied window manny creates a streak for every mimic he sees
peter leonard and susan are hard at work
leonard has created a small model of the station using pocket debris and the wall map
mannys lighter represents the subway car
this track were on
goes down into the repair area
makes an x further down the elevators over here
leads up to the active tunnels
an oily soft abdomen brushes lazily up against the glass
manny moves away
can we get this car there
someoned have to go to the switchroom pull the coupling lever thatll send us left and to the elevator
but the power
hell i might be able to juice the whole area if i can get to the power box
its just a couple of cables
oh how you gonna get there leonard
to leonard just talk me through it
i can go with manny
it would take a minute or so
beat you wont last that long out there
peter you couldnt even fix our tv
he points at the glands on the floor
well cover ourselves with this
they can mimic us we goddam mimic them
peter it worked before
an edge in her voice the scent wont last
thats why we should do it now
susan knows they have no other choice
susan is stuffing leonards old bloody bandages into the thorax of the dead mimic
she ties a flare to its center
its just a regular old pump switch okay
right by the track signal board
manny is spreading the mucus like liquid of the gland sac on himself and peter as leonard instructs them the lights come up you pull the switch
you dont do that were on the wrong track
turns to peter you
the two men look into each others eyes
you gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires
think you can handle it
you got a memo
leonards hard feelings give way to an almost imperceptible smile
using a ballpoint pen he draws a schematic on the back of peters hand
all right then
you gonna find two wires
the others blue
approaches manny who looks distractedly out the window
hes out there
i heard him
how can he be
i didnt protect him lady
he trusted me
and i didnt protect him
i lost his father to the streets and now chuy
well find him
well be back and find him
manny doesnt respond
susan dabs at peters face with the last touches of the scent gland substance
she doesnt meet his eyes as she speaks
youre going to have to keep it really slow
their eyes react to sudden movements
peter barely nods his nerves clearly on edge
he instinctively goes to wipe his forehead
susan stops him
dont touch it
and for godsakes try not to sweat
they can sense chemical changes
try not to sweat
leonard turns to susan and peter
leonards voice comes through like a clarion
are we ready for this
susan has her hand on peters chest peter is taking deep breaths trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat
its an odd parody of lamaze exercise
whatever you do dont step on the third rail coming back
six hundred voltsll blow your leg right off
a final breath
hes about as calm as hes going to get
he looks at susan a long moment
he takes her hand
i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers
and i remembered where they are
overlapping thats it
a sad nervous smile appears on peters face
in the tool box under the kitchen counter
susan kisses him softly on the lips
susan steps away from peter
she looks toward the control booth
begins turning the lever crank slowly
gradually begin to open and stop half way
the darkness outside is alive with clicking
slowly move between the opening of the door and make their way to they step onto the dusty concrete
come to a stop
watches nervously for the reaction of the mimics large shadows pass far and near of peter and manny but none of the mimics seem to care about them one way
or the other
peter and manny exchange looks a moment of relief
peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby power manny goes left starts to make a longer journey across the platform to the switch room
susan moves away from the door goes over the mimic carcass filled with the bloody bandages
peter makes his way to the edge of the platform whispering to himself
he lowers himself slowly to the track
manny moves toward the door
a large window of dusty glass reflects his image
and the distant ones of the mimics
peter gets to the track
he turns and is met face to face with a mimic
its antennae move toward his head curious
its human mask face plate clicks apart and together
peter remains stock still
he starts breathing deeply
leonard has now fully opened the doors
pulls the tipcase of the flare tied to the dead mimics midsection
the flare sparks alive
the sudden light draws the attention of several mimics outside
susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of the car
and with a heave throws it onto the front track
the other mimics take instant notice
the mimic before him suddenly turns
in a flash of speed its gone heading toward stuffed with the bloody rage the thing sends its fellow into a feeding frenzy
the other mimics begin tearing into it ripping their brother to shreds in cannibalistic orgy
susan watches in disgust
choke on it motherfuckers
leonard turns the lever crank again
the doors begin to shut
breathes a sigh of relief
he goes to the powerbox opens it up
he shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand
the simple chart tells him what to wire blue wires to to himself green
he looks back up at the powerbox
his face falls
all the wires are a gross brown their colored plastic casings having long ago faded into goo
the space is even more dusty than the rest of the station
spiderwebs strung over old machinery
white doric pillars support the ceiling like skeletal bones
s style lamps are built into their side
manny looks around
off to the right right next to the rusted track switch board he heads for the coupling switch
once there he rests and through the murky windows he waves back to leonard
he pulls out his pills box and takes a pill
but his hands are shaking under enormous tension
some of the pills scatter on the floor
he puts the box away and leans against the wall
a clicking nearby catches his attention echoing from the entrance of another room
it is not the sound of the mimics but rather of metal
manny follows the sound
peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way
he wipes off the brown gunk tries to discern any semblance of color
he feels himself start to sweat
he tries to relax
the space is larger than the switchroom
the walls and ceiling have an odd shiny consistency
manny heads in further locates the levers and waits
something pale and small emerges from the dark a few feet away a face that seems to float in the eerie half light
a rustling behind him
manny turns around
he swings the light onto chuy sitting on the floor before the remains of a rusty column
that beautiful emotionless smile on his pale face
peter has made all the necessary connections
he turns now to the fuse section
a red throw switch is there and two big slots for fuses
one is still occupied
the other one empty
beads of sweat begin to form
susan watches the mimics at their feast
all of a sudden they begin to stop as if losing interest
horrified the scents fading
susan steps back looks around desperately for a flashlight
tense as hell whats manny doing
i cant see him anymore
manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture of come to me
in the darkness something that looks like a palm frond floats gracefully down from the ceiling making see saw gestures as it falls through the air
manny shines his flashlight on the floor
its not a palm frond
its a wing
manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls
the place is covered with mimics
they are in the middle of a vicious mating ritual
the males tear savagely at the females wings as they proceed to mount them
a chaotic clusterfuck
manny is sickened
manny shines his light ahead
mannys face falls
the white pillar behind chuy is moving
at last revealing
an albino mimic
another leap for evolution
its form is different from the other mimics
sleeker more supple almost beautiful
and while its movements are still not completely human there is a kind of unearthly grace to them that at the very least entrance us
the thing raises itself to full height dwarfing the tiny boy
it stands over him like a king over his court fool
chuy giggles happily
its all a game to him
the albino clicks in response a long leisurely sound as if trying to communicate with the boy
chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them making a perfect imitation of the sound
manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with huge expressionless eyes
he turns to chuy barely audible chuy
the albino clicks his jaws moving in toward manny
plays his spoons in perfect imitation
stands under an archway in a swirl of dust
he raises his arms like a prophet
he lets go of hsi razor and kneels
god has closed his eyes
this he cannot see
his vacant eyes fill with tears he prays quietly a strange serenity invades him
the albinos jaws open and charge
some mimics advance toward peters direction
susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window trying to attract their attention
peter breaks the arm off one of his glasses
he jams it at the empty fuse
the electricity comes on
the lamps on the columns burst into flames from the power surge
fire illuminates the station like a greek temple
peter climbs up onto the tracks
sweat staining his forehead
peter wipes it and removes the scent coating
clearly react sensing the chemical change like bees reacting to honey
to leonard looks at the now lit control panels tries to decide which button to press
he begins to press each one in turn
hears the sound of spoons playing
he turns to see chuy standing by the outside of the switch room
the boy smiles
a flashlight shines behind him
but the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human the albino steps into view moving eerily like an unstrung puppet
his claws and jaws are coated in blood
chuy joyfully announces the arrival like a little drummer boy
climb over the roof moving toward the rear of the susan runs in
slams her hand down on a button
the doors open
peter hesitates takes a step toward chuy
come on kid
chuy seeks shelter behind the albinos legs
the albino charges toward him
peter bolts for the car
jump and land just as peter squeezes through one of the doors
the doors dent
yelling to leonard susan presses the button
the doors close again
the kids with them
what do you
leonard throws the dead mans switch by the control board
jolts into action
the train lurches forward
wheels spark and kick into gear
the mimics scramble and re assemble quickly ready to attack
changes position and charges towards the car
reaches a y section
the car moves to the track to the right
leonards eyes go wide as he sees he didnt do it
manny never threw the coupling switch
were goin the wrong way
it keeps bearing right
further away from their destination
towards an old storage yard in their path
idle cars and repair equipment on the tracks
a crash seems inevitable
leonard pulls but they dont work at all
from below the car we see the wheels spinning freely heading for collision
susan grabs leonard from the control booth
to peter they rush back against the opposite door
the car bashes into a parked section of train in a grin of tearing metal
flips off the track
and onto its side
the car skids to a stop
sparks fill the air
all three are hurt
leonards leg wound has reopened
peter has badly damaged his right arm
you all right
peter nods painfully
susan to leonard
simply re his leg cant feel it
peter and susan sling leonards arms over their shoulders
they raise him up
they move unsteadily outside
across both tracks
they head off over a concrete island in the direction of the correct track
the mimics and the albino moving closer
try to hurry but its no use given leonards condition
quietly lemme go
peter and susan both disregard the order
were no leaving you
no way we can outrun em together
leonard suddenly grabs his police baton from his belt clip
he pushes the two away
get the hell off my beat
leonard turns away from them
peter goes to get leonard but susan stops him
this mta officer is staying put
come to poppa
reluctantly the two begin down the tunnel
takes a stand by the third rail baton in hand
peter and susan run
an open cage elevator on a platform nearby
a sign overhead they rush toward it
leonard stands like a guardian to the tunnel mouth
sounds of the mimics approaching
he glances at the third rail beside him then down the track
come here you mealy mouthed
the sound gets louder
leonard raises his baton in top mta form
maggot munchin motherfu
several mimcs slam onto leonard
leonard goes down hitting them futilely with his baton
they begin to tear at his limbs
kicks his good leg out
and connects with the third rail
an arc of electricity lights up the darkness consuming leonard and the mimics
the crackling sound echoes through to peter and susan
susan hits the elevator button again
i cant tell if its working
peter has unbarred the gate
looks up into the shaft
coming down but its taking its own sweet time
oh come on come on
peter pulls her into the shaft closes the security gate behind them
a skeletal framework on each side
just enough for a handhold
peter steadies susan as she climbs in beside him
she balances on the narrow ledge
peter slams the cage door shut latching it
you go first
ill be right below you
your arm you cant
we can do this
he shows her the first hand and foothold
susan grabs on
the albino amkes its way forward flanked by two mimics
turns toward the elevator
susan hauls herself up the framework handhold by handhold
peter is right below her
she can see his arms are starting to tremble dangerously with the effort
were gonna make it
peter grinds his teeth trying to make the next handhold
something hits the gate below them
the mimics are tearing at the metal gate
the albino remains still watching them work
susans arm and legs are shaking now
her breath starts catching in her throat with the effort
dont hold your breath
keep it going even flow
susan tried but cant
she tries to pull herself up to the next level
talk to me
susan pulls herself up
im really glad im not pregnant
we look down past them as they climb
two of the mimics and the albino have gotten into the shaft
the albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against opposite walls
susan is crying barely any strength left
peter does his best to stay in control but in truth is barely hanging on himself
light hits them from the shaft above now sounds of people talking and a muffled p
announcement filter down
rushing upward on the shaft wall higher higher
peters hands grab onto the grating of the gate on the next floor
is heard above them
peter looks up
now the elevator is coming down
hang onto me
peter pulls susan up till she can grab it too both of them able to get a foothold on the ledge hang on tight
he begins to kick on the gate trying to tear it free
susan looks back down
the mimics rush up closer closer
the albino opens its mandibles
both kick at the gate it gives peter pulls susan through to the come on
peter and susan stumble away
the albino sees the elevator approaching from above
it gives a few clicks to its minions
the two other mimics race up the shaft
toward the elevator
and wedge themselves in on either side
they are crushed instantly
but the elevator is stopped just above the open gate
with just enough room for the albino to get through to susan and peter run
there is light just up the tunnel
we hear voices
dont look back
they go for it
at last they make it to susan and peter stumble forward
light streams down from overheads
the albino spills out onto the track behind them
sleek streamlined light glancing beautifully off it
headlights hit them as we hear the roar of a subway train heading at them from the other side of the platform
we can do it
runs faster than any other mimic
the express train blows its horn rushing forward
weary late night commuters stand half asleep on the tracks
a sleepy eyed little girl points tugging on her mothers hand
mommy theres people
adrenaline pumping we can do this
the driver sees the battered couple
he reaches for the brake
they reach the edge of the platform the horn deafening as the train speeds toward them
peter pushes susan up leaps we rush toward his horrified face
the train still flying plows into it
flattening grinding pulverizing
until the windshield of the subway car is covered in white blood
the motoran leans on the brake his eyes screwed shut in primal horror
the train squeals to a stop
susan and peter collapse on the cement floor in each others arms
heaving and weeping
commuters turn to stare as peter and susan move across the floor
both bruised and bloodied leaning against each other heading for the exit
some derelicts observe them with curiosity
a trio of mta cops start towards them
itll be fine
theyre still down there
well seal the whole system go in with whatever it takes
but peters voice evidences a lack of conviction now hes trying to convince both susan and himself of something he doesnt fully believe
itll be fine
we nailed them before well do it again
he hurries to meet the mta cops
susan looks up
commuters move to and fro moving up and down and in and out of the illuminated areas of the station
in the crush of onlookers is one deadpan face a mimic hugging the shadows waiting for its moment
we pan degrees to the other side of the platform there briefly glimpsed is another and another
we tilt down to the throng below
barely audible theyve come up
the electrified voice of the train announcer suddenly fades up telling of departures and delays we raise above susans head the local to poughkeepsie boarding now track the connecticut local
making connections to south norwalk culminating in an overhead view of the main terminal
the movement continues
but from here the people are dots their importanec no greater than that of a colony of ants
