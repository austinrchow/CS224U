written by george nolfi based on a short story by philip k dick the sounds of a large crowd but muffled as if were inside and hearing the crowd through
a window or door
fade in on david norris is having a private moment looking down thinking
he wears a suit and tie
he seems relaxed and confident
completely in his element
in one of his hands hes absentmindedly twirling a couple of individually wrapped ricola throat lozenges
we hear the muffled voice of someone on a pa system outside thank you so much for coming today a man in a blue blazer walks up to david
now reveal that were afl the entry hall of the admin building at st
a thousand people crowd the quad out front
norris for senate placards everywhere
fred omalley with the dnc
ive never seen a crowd this big turn out so early in the cycle
charlie traynor arrives
just wait till you see how they respond to him
david pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens his lapel pin which is shaped like new york state
dont build me up like that charlie
hell be disappointed
the crowd many of them in their twenties roars with approval as david walks out to the lectern on the steps of the admin building
im david norris
and im running for the us senate
the crowd goes wild
david finishes a speech at the fdny academys graduation
the cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing ovation
david shakes the hands of workers entering a
con edison plant in buffalo
hes a natural at this
unlike most politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning
flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick up basketball with a group of bronx teenagers
charlie is nearby
david takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin redevelopment of an old military base upstate
he gives a speech at a harlem church
audiences watch david the way they watched jfk the way they watch obama today
he inspires makes them believe makes them want to follow him
especially young people
david walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their camera phones
people crush around him
he doesnt seem to mind at all
he welcomes it
he feeds off it
he pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers speaking into a bullhorn to compensate for his
charlie stands nearby watching him speak
david enters his hotel room
the silence contrasts starkly with the noisy energy of the campaign trail
he turns on the tv
scrolls through the channels
after a moment shuts it off
total silence again
it bothers him
he opens up his briefcase
pulls out a thick file his itinerary for the next three days
dozens of speeches and meetings across the state
he glances at the summary page on the top
glances down the page with his finger stopping almost at random on a speech hes giving two days from now at the westchester county open space initiative
karen woods founder
kids samantha painting and ricky little league
two year old loyita
knows this cold
his finger runs down to a realtors association breakfast in nassau county four days out
abagail abby best stuart broxterman chapel davis milan sabovic jim vargas
his ability to retain this sort of information is stunning
he doesnt need to review
its already all there
he closes his itinerary file
goes to the window and looks out at the trees
the silence back
charlie enters the lobby
stops suddenly spots david holding court at the hotel bar
fifteen strangers around him as he regales them with a story despite the fact that hes clearly losing his voice
charlie walks over pulls him aside
what the hell
what happened to im going to have softie tea rest my voice and go to bed early
you have diane sawyer tomorrow and you have to be up at four am for us to make it in time
david is holding a beer in his left hand
with his free hand he picks up a cup and saucer
i had some tea
sees charlies not in the come on man
were eight points up in the polls
ive gotta cut loose every once in a while and have a life
this provokes a quizzical look from charlie
fifteen strangers in a crappy upstate sheraton doesnt seem like having a life to him
latest poll has you ten points up
a slow smile spreads across davids face
the sound of a busy room
then one voice much louder county reporting for lynfield for norris
charlie traynor walks over to the aide who just shouted that
shes writing vote totals onto a map of new york by county
better than i thought i thought wed get killed in seneca
he turns to look at a large suite full of more than a dozen norris supporters talking on phones and typing into laptops
eddie call boyd
where the hell are the
weve got to get the suffolk numbers
a light snow falls
four men in conservative suits overcoats and fedoras walk across the roof of a forty story building
their clothing is more timeless than old fashioned
and somehow so is their demeanor
the men get to the edge and look down over the city almost as if its their domain
david watches the election coverage on tv
pundits are discussing the new york senate race which cnn has already called for davids opponent
congressman norris has a reputation for being very direct even blunt in his campaign speeches which is great until you say too many things you wish you hadnt
then you start to look like an amateur
thats bad for any candidate but its fatal if youre running for senate at the age of your opponent keeps calling you an impulsive kid and you almost killed your
entire political career five months ago with an act of immaturity that ended up on the front page of
the new york post
david winces slightly
this is excruciating
just then charlie enters
the nerve center
suite is visible through the open door behind him
why are you still watching cnn
they called this way too early
david doesnt share his friends optimism
a campaign aide with a phone to her ear shouts to the room suffolk county numbers
charlie and david emerge from the private room to listen
charlies energy and optimism disappear instantly
after long beat i really thought wed win suffolk
a senior aide walks over
kings county just came in too
he shows a piece of paper to charlie and david
well its over
and its going to be a blowout
david puts on a brave face
but this is the first moment that he realizes not only is he going to lose but hes going to lose big
its going to be a grand
nbc has us up next
charlie takes a clicker and turns the closest tv to nbc
turning now to the new york senate race nbc is now calling the election for rogerlynfield
after a shockingly poor showing in both suffolk county and in his home county kings it now appears that david norris will lose this election badly perhaps by as much
the four men in dark suits
the bosss name is richardson early s
his top aide is
this is a
is ever ything set
richardson notices his eyes you look tired
you should take a vacation when we finish with this
youll have earned it
im not sure the kind of tired i feel would be fixed by a vacation
sure it would
everybody needs a vacation
the staff and supporters in here have become very quiet
their candidate is standing in the middle of the room but no one can look at him
and david cant look at them either
im going to take a walk figure out my speech
four hundred campaign workers follow election news on big screens in the waldorfs grand ballroom
no one says a word
the mood has gone from
hopeful to funereal in sixty seconds
david slips through the lobby with only a few looks from the staff
but when he
gets to the door he sees that press vans line the front of the hotel
there will be no peace for him if he steps out there
he turns around
good evening congressman
youre in the grand ballroom if thats what youre looking for
actually just looking for a place to be alone for a minute before i head in there
none of the banquet rooms on the third floor are in use tonight
david stands alone looking out at the empty room
trying to get used to it
its not easy
david enters the huge ornate mens room and goes to the row of sinks
he pulls two ricola cherry lozenges from his pocket
he twirls them in his hands for a moment
then tosses them into the trash can
he looks at himself in the mirror fighting to hold himself together
a sound behind him
david spins to see a woman exiting one of the stalls
shes in a stunning ball gown and carrying an expensive bottle of champagne
i hope i didnt startle you
what are you doing in here
hiding from security
what did you do
crashed a wedding
one floor up
its almost midnight
theyjust caught on now
ivana trump finally realized i wasnt her niece
i think after the fifth glass of champagne my czech accent started slipping
spite of davids state that gets a grin
are you for real
life is short
hard to argue with that
youre that guy running for senate arent you
im that guy
the other guys a tool
maybe i should have made that clearer in my ads
personally i think mooning your friends at a college reunion is no big deal
and i dont think the post should have printed the photo
david just shakes his head
he will never ever live that down and he knows it
at least not full page
he cant help but crack up
listen ive done it
you werent running for senate at the time
do you still have a chance or is it over
he crushed me
she has beautiful eyes
and an exceptional gift for conveying empathy
i dont know what you must be feeling
winning would feel better
but losing has its advantages
the only time a politician is alone is when hes asleep
or in the bathroom
after eight years in politics that gets kind of hard to take
she tilts her head a little gives him a curious look
watching you youd never know it
the way she looks at him the way she says it david knows she sees what others miss in him even if he isnt even quite sure what it is
well everything happens for a reason right
god im really rollrng out the platitudes tonight arent i
its the champagne
brines out the hallmark in people
after it kills their czech accents
she offers him the bottle
he hesitates then takes it
i have to think up some good platitudes for my speech
he takes a gulp of champagne
why the hell would you do that
apparently even if i hadnt been caught dropping my drawers in the middle of a senate campaign i would have lost the election anyway because im too blunt
swig of champagne says who
the tv pundits
they just wish they had the balls to be candidates themselves
she hands him the champagne bottle again
and they work for the man anyway
you going to run again
tonights probably not the night to ask
no it is
look at me
you have to run again
do yo hear me
shes serious about this
otherwise the country will be run by tools
of f her look lynfield
then they lean toward each other
it turns more and more passionate
when they finally pull apart holy shit
she seems just as surprised
they look at each other and laugh
just then the bathroom door opens
he sees david and the woman
i better go
the woman comes out of the bathroom
david is right behind her
the woman turns to face david
suddenly two hotel guards turn the corner and spot the woman
they rush toward her
to david emphatically
dont let the bastards grind you down
she spins and sprints away
the hotel guards chase her
what the hell was that
im really not sure
david has a huge grin on his face
but i think im ready to give my speech
david as he walks out from behind a curtain onto the dais
his supporters start clapping
but clearly theyre heartbroken
david looks completely peaceful
i grew up in red hook and i dont want to shock anybody but i got in a few fist fights along the way
laughter ripples through the crowd
we dont know enough yet to get the joke
and we used to have a saying when you got in a fight its not whether or not you get knocked down because eventually everyone does its what you do
when you get back up
dont worry im not going to moon you
the audience explodes with laughter this time
but i am
waiting for the laughter to die down but i am going to get backup
i wanted to come out here tonight and give you a victory speech a speech ive dreamed of giving foremost of my life
but life doesnt always deal you the cards you want
the audience sobered now
my life changed when i was ten years old
my entire world turned upside down
knows exactly what hes talking about
and as i looked for something to hang on to something to help me cope with what had
happened the only thing that made sense to me was service
finding a way to do something with my life that left this world a little better than i found it
the audience is moved
tears begin to well up
people dab at their eyes
the sky is just beginning to turn from black to deep blue
the park is still and silent
a black mercedes pulls up on madison ave
richardson again in a dark suit gets out and enters the park
harry sits on one of the benches a fedora in his lap to complement a gray flannel suit
he spills his coffee when he steps out of starbucks
the moment he comes through the door
our models indicate between and am
harry nods but he seems distant richardson sees this
you planned that vacation right
richardson claps him din the shoulder and leaves
harry watches him go
an alarm clock reads airy
it turns to and the alarm goes off
a hand reaches over and taps the alarm off
follow the arm back to david norris in a king sized bed
he rubs his eyes stretches his neck and climbs out of bed
david works out
hes got the energy level of a year old
he runs on a treadmill
hits the heavy bag
does sit ups
examine davids spacious one bedroom overlooking madison square park
his desk and dining room table is covered with stacks of paper and files
a flat screen displays cnbc rsr capital announced yesterday that david norris would become its vice chairman
norris worked at goldman sachs for four years before running for congress at the tender age of
a desk is set up at one end of the living room
a new model blackberry on the desk next to another cell phone
he served four terms in the house the blackberry rings
prior to his unsuccessful bid for senate in last weeks election
david rushes over and
icks up the blackberry
he has to look for a second to figure out how to hit answer
rsr one ofthe countrys fastest growing hedge funds is run by no riss former goldman colleague and campaign chairman charles the blackberry rings again
its very loud
electrifying concession speech led commentators to finally david finds the answer button as he mutes the tv
tom frankel from the journal is calling you in five minutes
i just gave him this number
im not used to this phone yet
hes going to ask you about joining the firm
my compliance guys say all firm business has to be done on the blackberry
you voted for it pal
in fact you cosponsored it
through the window we see david getting his morning coffee
he exits and leaves frame
hold on the door of starbucks
harry is snoring on his bench
david walks past
david arrives at fifth just in time to catch the m limited stop bus arriving at the stop
through a gap in the buildings and falls on harrys left eye waking him
he bolts upright
checks his watch shit
he looks around quickly
spots david about to get o n the bus
harry leaps up as david pays he notices harry sprinting for the bus
sir theres someone theres another m right behind me
the bus pulls out
harry keeps running after it
as david walks down the aisle a couple of passengers recognize his face
but they dont say anything
david nears an empty aisle seat
a woman is curled up in the window seat sleeping
she wears a funky mini dress knee high argyle socks under leather boots and a clashing argyle bucket cap
david sits next to her
its the woman from election night
he leans around to try to see the front of her face
its definitely her
his eyes drift down at her legs
just then she opens her eyes
she recoils for a second
then her eyes soften when she realizes who it is
we ve met
you need a better line than that or ill have to assume youre a pervert who likes to stare at girls legs while they sleep
smiles game on your skirt was so short i couldnt help it
skirt dress same thing
if youre a pervert yeah
all that matters is they both show leg
so do shorts dear
yeah but theres that pesky piece of fabric right here that interferes with your fantasy life
she shuts her eyes and leans against the window
wake me when you have a good come back to that
i have one but unlike you i wouldnt say it in public
eyes still closed pussy
can not believe this woman
in a good way
his blackberry rings
her eyes pop open
david looks at his
the signal has gone to zero
the line cut
that ringer get any louder or do you pretty much have it maxed out
i never sleep through the night
i catch up on the bus
you going to run again
i just started a new job today
i saw your concession speech
i heard bill clinton called it the best political speech hes seen in years
david looks back at her
something got into me
he means her
they stare at each other
whats the deal with you and argyles
whats the deal with you and boring shades of blue
david is wearing a navy blue suit blue shirt and blue tie
at least my clothes match
thats easy if you
restrict yourself to one color
the belt and shoes are black
variety is the spice of
there you go with the platitudes again
i guess it wasnt the ch mpagne
his blackberry goes again
he shakes his head
its dead again
harry runs down broadway looking east on th to try to spot the bus on park
your phone sucks
dont guys like you get special phones that actually work in the middle of the biggest city in the country
depends what the telecom lobby thinks of your voting record
harry spots the bus passing on park
he jams his fedora on his head and stretches his arm out now
davids phone rings again
as he reaches for the phone he fumbles his coffee cup the lid comes off and a slosh of coffee crests the brim and splashes on the womans dress
hes looking at a leather portfolio
we catch a glimpse inside a complicated circuit diagram
harry shuts the book looks up to get a bead on the the bus then takes off down broadway again hoping to cut it off at union square
ill pay for the damage
he pulls out his wallet
hope your new job pays better than your old one
give me your number and ill send you a check
god that is smooth
spill coffee on me then ask for my number
she takes the coffee from his hands and casually takes a sip then turns back to him with a devilish look in her eyes
just let me spill some on you and well be even
she thrusts the cup toward his tie
its my first day at the office
tell your boss some crazy chick dumped coffee on you on the mi
its new york hell understand
she thrusts the cup back at him no
he grabs the cup with both his hands over hers
just a little
they struggle with the cup
david youre crazy
the phone on davids laprings again
she snatches it with her free hand
hes not here
she hangs up
who was that
he lunges for his phone but she holds it on the other side of her body
what is this third grade
you forgot what that was like didnt you
how fun it was
that stops him for a moment
until the phone rings again
oh my god
how do you stand it
she drops the phone into the coffee
he stares at her
they lock eyes
god knows what would come next if they were in private
the fourth ring gurgles up through the coffee
sturdy little fucker isnt it
she pulls the phone out of the cup and wipes it off with her scarf pushing the button which sends the call to voice mail
then she reaches out her hand as if to shake
by the way im elise
david stands at the bus door watching her
she turns back to look at him
the morning after
i lost i woke up thinking about you
that melts her
all her bravado drops
through the window david watches elise walking down the sidewalk
their eyes meet
she blows him a little kiss before she turns the corner
his heart skips a beat as the bus continues on down union square east
harry runs through union square bee lining for davids bus
david looks at elises number scribbled on a piece of paper
he carefully tucks her number into his wallet
then takes the most satisfying sip of coffee hes ever had in his life spotting david through the bus window harry thrusts his fedora back onto his head and points
at the bus just as david finishes his sip the plastic lid pops off the cup
a second earlier and the coffee would have poured all over his shirt
instead it spills on the floor
harry sprints out onto lark avenue now right behind the bus honk
harry turns just in time to see a
taxi skid into him
he rolls up onto the hood a big corner office
the phone rings
charlie picks up
guess who i just sat down next to on the bus
the woman from election night
a dazed harry lies in the road
the taxi driver who hit him jumps out of his car to see if harry is okay
the one you kissed
she kissed me
i just didnt fight it
harry sits up
hes bruised but okay
he looks around for something
spots his crushed hat under the taxis front tire
youre shitting me
just randomly you sit down next to hes cut off mid word
david looks at his phone
call lost on the screen
david hits redial
gets a fast busy
this is ridiculous
he pockets his phone
the taxi driver is with harry now
are you okay
harry is sitting now wincing but still searching intently for something
im fine will you hand me that
harry points at his leather portfolio on the pavement a few feet away
well come to know it as a planbook
are you sure youre okay
the driver hands it to him
harry flips to a bookmarked page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram thousands of interconnected lines
dozens of geometric symbols at intersection points
and written notations in a language as complex as sanskrit crossed with chinese
and maybe its just a trick of the light but several of the lines appear to re arrange themselves on the page
davids still grinning as he reaches his downtown office tower
he enters through the revolving door empty except for a bored looking security guard at the other end of the lobby
david gets into an empty elevator
david walks past the receptionist shes on the phone
he waves as he passes by
no wade back
she must not see him
daviddecides he doesnt need to announce himself
david enters to find the office suite quiet
not a soul in sight
not a single secretary is here
loud playful doesnt anybody bother getting in before eight at this place
david passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office marked charles traynor chairman
how are you today
when she doesnt move susan
david looks closer across her desk
her face is frozen
he leans across her desk touches her arm
she stays dead still
david rushes through charlies door call
somethings wrong with susan
and rushes in to find that charlie is frozen too with the phone up to his ear
like hes in a wax museum
he is surrounded by four men in bulky metallic silver protective suits
think airport firefighter gear
one of the men adjusts three metal
probes which are attached to the left side
of charlies skull
three men in business suits talking by the window spin to see david
richardson and two aides we recognize as the security guards who chased elise away on election night
what the hell are you doing
richardson blinks clearly surprised
then grab him
david bolts out of the office as they lunge at him david sprints toward the door he came in
it closes as he gets there
he grabs it
he sprints away into an internal hallway
richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway
david jumps a mile
its physically impossible that richardson could have gotten there that fast
you cant get away david
david spins and rushes back into the main office then down an internal staircase to the floor below
jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard
as he comes up he runs smack into another rsr employee who is frozen solid
david curses then dives around the frozen employee to find richardson coming out of another office
down the hall
again physically impossible for him to get there that fast david spins and a distorted wide angle shot of a chloroform rag shoved right at us
focus goes in and out
from davids pov blurry focus as hes carried toward one of the large corner offices on the th floor
the nameplate reads steve kincaid
richardson opens the door and ushers his men carrying david except when they walk through the door theyre not in an office floors above lower manhattan they step inside a
their movement completely violates the laws of physics
then voices come up slowly yes sir
i understand that sir
ill do that sir
what a goddamm mess
was that donaldson
what do you want to do
fade up blurry at first to davids pov of the warehouse david caught a glimpse of just before he passed out
a half dozen members of the intervention team the silver suits stand nearby
richardson and mccrady one of the men from the rooftops stand behind david about feet away
can you reset him
i dont think we have the authority in a situation like this
legal just arrived
reveal burdensky a year old in a pin stripe suit carrying a briefcase
walks to richardson
re settings off the table
this is our fault
richardson glances irately at harry who stands by himself off to the side clearly disgraced
david who is tied to a chair facing away from richardson cranes around to see whos talking
the suits stare back in silence for a beat then turn back to talking amongst themselves though at a lower volume
what are my options
you could bullshit him but youll never be completely successful
can somebody tell me whats going on
still ignoring him the questions will burn in him till the day he dies
youll have to monitor him constantly
he can hear little snippets of what burdenskys saying to make sure he doesnt talk
the endless ripple effects
reveal david untying the rope restraining him
if it were me id level with him
thats the only way to extinguish his curiosity
richardson turns and studies david
then walks over to him
an uncomfortable pause
who are you guys
were the people v ho make sure things happen according to plan
david stares back at him for a moment
then leaps up
his rope comes off and the chair falls
he sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse
richardson makes a little gesture with his hand it cracks
and displaces upward
so its uneven just as davids foot comes down on it
david trips and goes flying david is dragged back to the center of the room and placed back in his chair in front of richardson
did you really think i couldnt see that coming
david dabs blood from his lip which split during the fall
i can read your mind
david stares back
choose a color
barely a beat blue
choose a number
even less time seventeen
davids jaw drops slightly
richardson was clearly right
why are you still deciding whether or not to run
davids hands go to his head involuntarily an atavistic response as if s
omehow that will keep his thoughts from spilling out into view
you saw the futility of that back at the office
davids entire reality has finally been bent to the breaking point
he cant hang on any longer to an explanation for all this based in the world hes known to date
what the hell is happening to me
you just saw behind a curtain you werent even supposed to know was there mr
came to work
it wasnt your fault
your path through the world this morning was supposed to be adjusted
glancing bitterly at harry in the corner your coffee was supposed to
spill onto your shirt as you left starbucks near your apartment
you would have gone up to change and arrived at work ten minutes later than you did
by then we would have left
people call it chance when their coffee spills or their internet goes down or they misplace their keys
sometimes it is
sometimes its us
nudging you back on plan
david takes all this in
hes still shell shocked
whatever you were doing to charlie back there
it wasnt misplacing his keys
when nudging a person back on plan isnt enough we intervene directly
what did you do to him
you need to worry about getting back on your plan david not worry about us putting him back on his
david stares back still trying to get his bearings
only a handful of human beings know what you now know david
were determined to keep it that way
so before i let you go you need to understand something if you ever reveal our existence we will erase your brain
your memories your emotions your entire personality will be expunged
your friends and family will think youve gone crazy
you wont think anything because a blank slate cant think
do you understand what i just said
not a word
not one word about us
long beat as he studies okay
youre free to go
david stands there a monent
not sure its real
richardson points at the door
david walks toward it
just then another man comes up to richardson
theres always woman
richardson motions to his men
the door two men come through from outside and block davids exit
he said i could go
you wont believe who she is
he holds open a planbook for richardson to see
how is that possible
why didnt we get an alert
he wasnt supposed to be on that bus
he was supposed to be changing his shirt in his apartment
it was a controlled situation
it was supposed to be
the new man looks at harry
david looks back at richardson
you said i could go
richardson walks over to him
you ran into a woman named elise on the bus this morning
going very still why does itmatter
you werent ever supposed to see her again
why do you care
because david you cant be with her
and we didnt want to have to resort to this four big guys grab david and pull his arms backwards like prison guards incapacitating a prisoner
richardson reaches into davids pocket and pulls out his wallet what the hell what are you richardson removes the piece of paper that elise wrote her number on from davids
richardson places the wallet back in davids pocket then pulls out a lighter no
and burns elises number
david strains and tries to pull loose from the vice like grip of the four intervention team men
but he cant get free
what is wrong with you people
richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn
on davids reaction cut to david exits through a steel door
it clangs shut behind him
he stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts walking to the corner to orient himself
down one street he spots the manhattan bridge down the other the brooklyn bridge
hes in dumbo
david sits alone at the bar
his hand trembles slightly
youre david norris right
we should talk
but not here
go back to work and ill contact you later today with a place to meet
harry can see that david is still very shaken
the worlds exactly the same as its always been
you just understand it more completely now
hang on to what mattered before you knew any of this and youll be fine
a thousand yard stare on his face david walks toward downtown manhattan amid dozens of pedestrian commuters
stares at hisnew colleagues going about their business as if nothing happened
david stands in ftontof the corner office labeled steve kincaid
he hesitates then opens it
he sees an empty office with a killer view of new york harbor
its strangely disorienting for him
ikincaids in the finance meeting congressitan
main conference room
david turns to see her
david walks away still trying to get his bearings in the new reality he now knows
charlie comes around a corner
there you are
i called your cell ten times
you left me hanging
seeing the look in are you okay
off davids nod come on were late
happy first day by the way
they head towards the conference room
you sure youre okay
how about you
no headaches or i feel fantastic man
is it just me or is this an odd conversation
off david s non response
what the hell happened with the girl
after the meeting
long shot from outside the building
the firms partners sit at their weekly investment committee meeting
david watches charlie intently looking for whats changed
david and charlie walk back to davids office
please explain to me why you dont have an ear to ear smile right now
its like his friend is an alien
but then again hes totally normal
i lost her number
you lost her number
searching for something i was pickpocketed
you cant be serious
off davids look youre serious
im really sorry
david sits on a bench looking at the water
the wind picks up and he puts his hands in his coatpockets to keep them warm
his right hand feels something
he pulls out a ticket for the pm circle
line tourist boat cruise
circle line crutge day the boat pulls away front the dock
its misting rain so theres only asmattering of tourists on board
david stands looking back at manhattan
harry is next to him
a lot of people just collapse when they see what youve seen
their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them
life starts to feel pointless
i was raised to believe theres something behind the curtain
i just never pictured it quite like this
most people dont
harry looks over his shoulder scans for any signs of his colleagues
hes far from relaxed
how are you feeling
you should know
you can read my mind right
as if hes not sure how much to tell david how far to go with this
finally richardson was just trying to scare you
he knew what color i was thinking
because he set it up as a choice
choose a color
choose a number so
harry looks away
hes crossing a line
hes really putting himself out there we cant read your mind or hear your thoughts
but before you make a choice your brain weighs options and we percpite that
we know if youre going to go off plan or not because as long as were close enough we cansense it when its about to happen
it s like a sixth sense for you
what did they do too charlie
made some small change in the way he assesses risk
what type of risk
this is beside the point i dont know
something to do with mortgage backed securities
what would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me
this is precisely what harry has been worried about
thats why were meeting out here
theyre not following me
we dont have the manpower to follow everybody all the time
theyre checking in on you
just not here
not right now
on davids face considering this
they stand out of earshot of the few tourists up here
why are you helping me
i have my reasons
david studies him
ha rrys clearly not ready to go into why do they care if im with elise
your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman
why do they care
harry looks back at him
taken aback a bit by how much david seems to care
i dont know
you have no idea
all i know is given the amount of resources theyve used keeping you from her is pretty important to them
off davids silence youre going to look for her arent you
again david is silent
there are twelve million people in this city
on a slow day
youre not going to find her you do realize that dont yore
even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain no matter how many times you called it you d never get through
his face hardening they send you here to tell me that
you want my advice
forget about her
accept that you ll never see her again
move on with your life
on david as harrys words sink in
huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside davids apartment
the trees are blooming
its spring now
an alarm clock reads am
david lies alone in bed
hes already awake staring at the ceiling
after a long beat the alarm clock rings
david shuts it off
but then just lies there
its the same apartment except its bigger now
instead of two large windows on the park his apartment is now six windows across
he has bought the two one bedrooms next to his and knocked the walls down
three years have passed
no files on the table like there were the last time we were here
david is on the phone in a new park view study
how are you feeling about the speech
david has not noticeably aged and yet hes more tempered and subdued than when we last saw him
we hear it in his voice im ready
i changed a few things last night
tell me at breakfast
david finishes his call then looks out the window
there is a detachment in h s eyes that didnt exist before
after a moment he gets his coat and heads for the door
david exits starbucks with a coffee
he walks across the park toward the same fifth avenue bus stop he did three years ado
even his posture and gait are different
david enters the ml bus
he feeds his metrocard into the reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders
more out of habit than actual hope
he walks back to take a seat
david stares idly out the window
his blackberry buzzes with a text message
looks down at it
then looks back out the window
suddenly his eyes snap into focus
davids pov the bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk
davids head whips around only able to see her from the back now
she walks like elise
shes dressed in the same eclectic style
he slams the red next stop strip jumps to his feet and runs to the front of the bus
stop the bus
the next stop now
the bus stops
david jumps out on broadway
follow him as he takes off across the street and runs down th
he catches up to her at university place
the woman turns around
and its her
reeling from the adrenaline david takes a moment then from the heart i rode the ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day id run
into you again
shes amused rather than moved because she doesnt buy it
calling would have been easier
girlfriend wouldnt let you
she looks at him with continued skepticism
but his expression is dead serious
can we go somewhere and talk
it hurt when he didnt call
shes angry at herself for that but its the truth
re his suit dont you have to get to work
i just got sick
i havent seen you in three years you make me sick is not an ideal come on
for the record
his phone vibrates
he pulls it out of his pocket
charliet cant make breakfast
i might have to push the speech
are you crazy
i just ran into elise
he hangs up
you just hung up on your best friend
weve known each other since we were kids
we have a shorthand
hes not being flip or clever or smooth
hes being matter of fact
lets take a walk
his focus on her is absolute
but shes wary of getting reeled in again
we have a lot to talk about
i dont think you should cancel your speech
what if i dont like you at the end of our walk
ill take my chances
seri us y my number hasnt changed
just call me like you didnt last time
my speech will always be there you might not be
i was there david
you didnt callrie
walk with me and ill explain that
shes still dubious
his phone vibrates
this time he turns it off
a statement of fact im not losing you again
im not letting you out of my sight
can we walk
the moment she finally relents cut to polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders
richardson sits at a large desk
the design is art deco crossed with albert speer
downtown manhattan is visible out the th floor window
richardsons aide enters
we have a problem
david and elise walk north
its been years david
how do you know i dont have a boyfriend
he hasnt even had time to think about that
you have a boyfriend
would it matter
so all the stuff about me being in your mind constantly for the last three years was just talk
the truth is you dont have any real conviction
it wouldnt matter
so you dont care about being a home wrecker
if you were married it would matter
now youre just trying to say what you think i want to hear
she lets david twist in the wind
on davids face relief
now lets hear your bullshit excuse for never calling me
i didnt have your number
it was taken from me
i was mugged
oh come on
your number was in my wallet and they took it
what else could possibly explain my fawning all over you on that bus three years ago
and again today and not calling you in between
um you had a girlfriend and you felt guilty
i have a thing about being lied to david
i swear to god i didnt have your number
i swear on my parents graves
i didnt even have a last name to try to track you down
do you know how many pages come back when you type elise into google
and none of them were you
after a beat you really are smooth
thats not fair
i like it
i probably shouldnt but i do
mccrady holds open his planbook to show richardson an ever shifting diagram
tell me youre kidding
how could our path analysis miss this
mccrady just shakes his head mystified
richardson walks to the closet and pulls out his fedora
rlhek e are they now
david and elise walk past bethesda fountain
i read somewhere youre running again
i havent announced yet but
i hope i had a little something to do with that
that concession speech i gave sure did
you had everything to do with that
you know entirely too much about me given how little i know about you
according to cosmo im supposed to keep it that way
according to maxim im supposed to maintain eye contact and ask you what you do for a living
its the first witty comment h s made this time around
hes just barely starting t alooa en up
im a dancer
not like that you pervert
in a dance company
manhattan modern ballet
i think you have the wrong idea about me
i think it was the first thing that crossed your mind
is there a performance of this company coming up that i could watch
actually we have a show opening tomorrow night
you hungry yet
he points at the boathouse restaurant a few hundred feet down the path theyre on
but im not putting out just because youre buying me brunch
we could wait an hour and call it lunch
i bet lines like that work wonders with the dancers you normally hang out with
richardson and mccrady step out of a small outdoor bar structure
they spotdavid and elise walking in the side door of the restaurant
somehow richardson and mccrady have travelled from downtown manhattan to the middle of central park in the time it took david and elise to walk feet
david and elise are at atable next to the lake
its good to see you again
pulling it from the recesses of his brain paul right
how did you remember that
its been a year
richardson surreptitiously watches david and elise while mccrady consults his planbook
a richardson aide steps out of the same door richardson and mccrady came through
morris is on the artistic director
melton is on charlie traynor
this whole thing will be over in an hour
disturbed by something he sees in his planbook we may not have that long
thewaiter leaves david and elise
how do you do that
i cant remember the names of people i just met
points at himself david
her decision tree is diverging from our models
hours without contact and shell never speak to him again
ive studied her file
her deepest fear in life is
no something is wrong
im already seeing inflection points
off richardsons surprised look davidand elise eat brunch
ballet is basically impossible to do correctly
you just do absurd things
with your body
the movement is completely unnatural
it requires incredible strength in all sorts of random muscles
and you have to be born with ridiculous amounts of flexibility in your hip or youll never be an y good
mccrady examines his planbook diagram
with each new update of the diagram red inflection points move across the pages toward a heavy black present time line on the right side of the right page richardson
points at the red point closest to the present tithe hrie
if they kiss
a kiss thats all it takes
a real kiss
but once they do that every possible adjustment thats strong enough to break them up will cause ripples over your limit
if melton and morris do their jobs right well be okay
but richardson is clearly worried
david and elise
in the history of ballet thereve only been a handful of people who actually did ballet the way its supposed to be done
forme that just made it completely addictive
do you ever get nervous when people watch you
do you get anxious when you make a speech
i get more anxious alone in my apartment than in front of an auditorium full of people
everythings backwards for me
i hate to interrupt
they turn to see charlieaynor
boathouse patio day richardson turns to a colleague melton who steps through the bar house door
re charlies arrival nice work
how did you find me
does it matter
elise pleasure to see you again
theres a crowd of people standing around downtown waiting for you
hes announcing today
at the speech
its not okay
the one thing you cant be this
time around is impulsive
thats why were announcing the way we are god dont skip this for me
i told you im not letting you out of my sight
david what the hell
to elise realizing a way out of his dilemma come with me
come and watch
her phone buzzes with a text message
to both of them great
now lets pay and get you over there
charlie waves the waiter over to give them the check
the speech is in minutes
i cant then
indicating text message they just moved my dress rehearsal to noon
davids own sixth sense kicks in
has he been discovered
we can reschedule the speech
david looks around for anything out of the ordinary any sign of richardson or his men
they stay out of view
he thinks theyre not on to him yet
ill meet you right after the rehearsal
where does your company perform
were n in our space
there was a apower ot outage or something
checking the text were using a space on murray and west broadway today
thats four blocks from where youre speaking
david reacts richardson cant be behind that
you can literally walk there after the speech
david nods his suspicions fading
but weve got to leave right now
richardson and his team watch as david convinced now hes still undiscovered stands up and heads to the door with charlie and elise
the four blocks thing was a brilliant move boss
putting his hat on were not out of the woods yet
he looks down at the inflection points in mccradys planbook
david and charlie and elise walk toward the side
ive got to go that way
to stop by my apartment and change
david and elise stop to say goodbye to each other
you know the speech on election night you said i inspired you
i wish i could do that again now
richardson makes a small hand motion in charlies direction
charlies iphone buzzes
its an alarm reminder
a text appears minute sound check
hes a few feet from david leans toward elise
david the speech starts in minutes
we have a minute drive
richardson makes a gesture at the tv by the bar
the picture changes though we cant see to what
he then moves a water glass ontheir table
the sun hits the glass and reflects into the bar area where the reflection catches the eye of a year old woman having a coffee at the bar with her
year old mother
turning so the sun is out of hereyes causes the daughter to notice the tv an image of davids famous concession speech from three years ago
a screen graphic reads announcing today
as the daughter turns back to look at her mother she notices david over her moms shoulder
david squeezes her hand
and leans in again just want to i hope the rumors are true congressman
david pulls back fr bm elise suddenly self conscious turns to see the year old woman richardson just manipulated
she points at the tv report on davids announcement
you have my vote
and i usually disagree with her
thanks a lot
david turns back to elise
well youre really just a hit with women of all ages arent you
on the phone
im wrangling him right now whatever happens
im not going to let anything stand between us this time
its such an odd thing to say if you dont know what david has gone through
she gives him a quizzical look
but shes also moved by his tone okay
i believe you
of course i tend to believe in the wrong people
its the kind of quip thats more truth than jest
not this time
he leans in to kiss her a horrified look from richardson david kisses elise on the cheek
but he lingers
away without going further
ill see you in two hours
richardson and his colleagues all breathe a large sigh of relief
as they watch david leave
that was way too close
what the hell is going on with this case
david and charlie ride in the back
charlie looks at david
ive just never seen you like that
david cant possibly explain
im going to postpone my announcement to have brunch with a woman
postpone any speech
i know she made an impression on you but this is
charlie just shakes his head unable to comprehend
what is it about her
i dont know
david pulls up outside
hundreds of his supporters and the press are waiting for him
he gets out of the car to cheers
richardson stands with mccrady on the upper level of a two story lobby looking out at david arriving for his speech
elise changes into her dance gear
big smile on her face
she spots something on her bookshelf we cant see what and her smile fades
she takes it and puts it in a drawer
her phone vibrates
she has a text message power back on at mmb
rehearsal at noon
mccrady hangs up a silver cell phone and nods at richardson its done
just then richardsons phone buzzes
the caller id says mr
believe me it was a surprise to me too
but i think we have it under control
elise and her friend lauren s stretch between routines
an unexpected smile spreads across elises face
oh youre clone
a half dozen news organizations film the speech
im here today to honor that and to announce my intention to run for the united states senate
just tell me if he disappears one more time youll never take his call again
the audience applauds energetically
david nods thank you and steps away from the lectern they set up
he shakes two or three peoples hands but then heads inside the building
david huddles inside with charlie
reporters outside are in front of their cameras filing their stories amidst the lingering crowd
good morning america at am tomorrow then you have the bankers group
david are you listening
davids staring out the window
the sunlight has caught the building across the street just right to illuminate richardson and mccrady on the second floor
i keep you posted sir
richardson hangs up the phone and turns
t look out at david
as he does he real zes david can see him
richardson steps back out of the sunlight
get out of the sunlight
mccrady notices david looking jumps back out of the light
i cannot get a break on this case
charlie is trying to understand what davids staring at
i have to see elise now
after you go back out there and talk to the new york channels tomorrow
he heads for the door
no we need this on the nightly catching up to david and david
charlie looks at him for a moment searching for the right words to say to a friend
every time we get close
you do something to derail it
theres a truth to that
david knows it
but this is different
trust me its different
david looks at thepiece of
address on west broadway for nyman studios hes standing at the locked front door
no one inside
richardson is on to him
the surprise on his face turns to anger
he dials elises number on his cell
i doubt youll ever get this message but david dials
can i have the number for the manhattan modern ballet
he looks down to see his phone has zero bars
david goes to the saleswoman
through the window we see he saleswoman dial a number
then look at the phone and shrug
she and david go to her computer
she looks at it puzzled
its dead too
pull back to reveal richardson and mccrady
hes going to go next door
just then david exits the furniture store and goes next door to a clothing store you cant keep
thephones and internet down on the whole block for too much
longer without running into ripple problems
and goes to an agent
thagent googles manhattan modern ballet
nothing shows rtal estate agent could itbe called something else
do you have a phone book
david gets to the phone book page that ends with manhattan mobile phone company
the next page is torn out
david slams his fist down
david exits the office to find richardson on the sidewalk
with mccrady nearby
there is an entire world of women out there
i thought i made it clear this one was off limits
david takes off walking
i must have forgotten
its been a while
doesnt change the fact
david looks around trying to figure out his next move
why are you so
determined to keep us apart
you know why
if there is a pi ri you misread it
theres no misreading what the plan says about you and elise
then your plans wrong
do you realize who wrote this plan
i dont care
richardson grabs him and pushes him against a brick wall
well you should
you need to learn a little more respect
david shoves him off
looks like he might take a swing at richardson
then his eye catches the complex diagram that mccrady is looking at in his planbook
why are you keeping us apart
because the plan calls for it
you put us together three times that was chance
that wasnt us
if im not supposed to be with her then why do i feel like this
it doesnt matter what you feel
it matters whats in black and white
davids ready to explode at him when he sees something in richardsons eyes
then his whole expression changes
you dont know do you
you dont know why theyre keeping us apart
its not something your mind could comprehend
youre in a nice suit but the reality is youre just a minion arent you
david pushes past richardson and walks into a busy restaurant
mccrady quickly consults his planbook
hes deciding how to uh
oh david strides in and goes right to a chair
stands on it
excuse me ladies and gentleman as people turn and look im sorry to disturb your lunch
i have a bit of an emergency
is there anybody in this room whos ever seen a performance of the manhattan modern ballet
from outside richardson and mccrady watch
son of a bitch
hes very smart
david exits the restaurant from another door
he hurries toward west broadway
not a taxi in sight
david looks for one in vain
suddenly richardson emerges from a storefront and goes to david
maybe you should try the subway
david holds him in a steely gaze
dont all those cab drivers youre diverting have plans too
what about all the other people looking for cabs in this part of the city right n t
what about their plans
the ripples must be endless
richardson is taken aback that david has figuredthis out
i dont care what you put in my way im not going to give up
david walks off leaving richardson standing there
richardson and mccrady watch david looking for a taxi at a very busy intersection
youve got two more minutes keeping taxis off west broadway before i need something thats going to keep him in place longer on foot david heads west towards hudson st
several taxis pass with their roof lights off
suddenly down the street he sees one with his roof light on
he runs for
it when crash twenty feet in front of him two cars collide
metal crunches and glass breaks
this is no fender bender jesus
looks for richardson is this how far you people will go
he rushes toward the accident an hour later
four police cars and an ambulance
they treating one of the accident s victims for minor scrapes avid is getting intervie ved by a police officer
unfortunately youre the only witness congressman
how much longer
a few more minutes
i know you have to meet somebody
i didnt say i had to meet anyone
i just assumed
richardson is watching david get interviewed amateur
thats an amateurs mistake
youre not a real cop are you
youre one of them
somebody could have been killed in that crash
doesnt that make you sir calm down
but davids already walking away
he goes to the highest ranking guy on the
i know you heed a statement from me but do i have to stay here to give it to you or no sir we know ow to get in touch
is this man under your command
david turns to see that the police officer who was interviewing him is gone
david gets into a taxi
th street between th and th
and sir you might have to break some traffic laws getting there
so take this
he hands him a bill
a light that just turned green go through that the driver blows through it as it turns re richardson and mccrady are in front of a hip cafe arguing
i want more red liuhtss consulting planbook there are too many ripples in the system
lative effects are
coming into play
a traffic jam
thats even w r
we have to get more localize
richardson looks at the taxi disappearing up hudson
hes getting out of range
richardson and mccrady rush through the cafe and into the kitchen surprising the chef so completely that he cant even manage a word before they throw open the insulated door
to the cold pantry and run inside
the chef charges over and pulls open the door to find refrigerated food
and nothing else
richardson and mccrady have disappeared
the chef blinks
richardson and mccrady rush from a storage room to the showroom of a fancy art gallery
patrons stare as they rush straight out the front door and onto gansevoort street
davids taxi is hitting all the lights iiow
richardson and mccrady move swiftly down the block
richardson heads up the stairs of a brownstone
opens the door to see a street in chinatown
he slams the door shut
two doors down
god i hate downtown
davids taxi heads down th from th avenue
richardson and mccrady step out of the service door of a l ilding on the corner of th avenue and th
they can see a taxi pulling up in front of the manhattan modern ballet buildig down the block
they run towards it
ive got inflection points
all they have to do is catch sight of each other this time what
david opens the door to elises dance company oblivious to richardsons pursuit
lauren is nearby as david speaks to the receptionist
music comes from a door across the room
is she expecting you
i hope you realize how lucky you are
im the friend
richardson dons his fedora as he races toward the studio
can i block the front door
hes already through pit
the next one
lauren walks david toward the door with the music behind it
it goes without saying that ill kill you if you hurt her
and by the way congratulations on your announcement
richardson and mccrady down the street
re diagram confused there are several next ones
im blocking them all his hand stretches out as harry did early on in film wait hes music pours out as david opens the door
a quarter of the way open the door stops dead
richardson grabs the front door and pulls
its sealed shut
it wont budge
mccrady is behind him he points
at richardsons fedora which is on the sidewalk
fell off when he ran
richardson sprints to grab it david looks through the narrow space of the open door and sees elise dancing
the piece shes practicing fuses the gra e ballet with the raw emotion of modern
shes i xl eattaking
im in serious trouble here
richardson dashes back to the door forget it
hes already there
richardson charges into the lobby to see david staring through the partially open door to the rehearsal room
mccradys phone buzzes
he pulls it out and looks at the caller id
richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in his hands
david turns just in time to see this
at the same time david realizes the door is no longer stuck
celebrate while you can
theyll just kick it upstairs now you have no idea what youre up against
david just looks at him
hell deal with that when it comes
richardson grabs the phone and answers
going outside to talk
david turns back to the dance studio
he opens the door to get an unobstructed view of elisee
she spins arches dips
david cant take his eyes off hey when the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes elise gives david a
then they start again
david looks back out at richardson on the street but hes gone
a defeated richardson trudges up a long flight of stairs
richardson walks down a hallway with an impossibly shiny black floor and enters a doorway marked mr
two secretaries look up at him
hes waiting for you
much larger than richardsons office and on a higher floor
donaldson sits at his desk reading a document
after a moment he signs it at the bottom and looks up revealing richardson who is standing awkwardly in front of his superiors desk
donaldson motions for him to sit down
david talks to elise whos showered and dressed youre incredible
how did you get that good
its all i do
its the only thing i ever wante to be
and i started young
by third grade i was going every day after school
thats a lot of motivation for an eight year old
she waves to the other dancers and receptionist in the lobby and they exit on to we moved around a lot then
dance was kind of my stability
it was the only constant in your life aside from your parents
really more the dance
she doesnt make a big deal of it but we get it
davids phone buzzes
caller id shows its charlie
i take it this is an unauthorized social break
im a candidate for the us serrate
i dont have to punch outwhen i leave
david sends the call to voice
couple houtrs while im out of touch wont ill him
couple hour huh
well we better make them count
a taxi pulls tpaa stop
bavid leans over elise to look out thew n ow as he waits fot change from the driver
whats this pi whats it look like
we see the reflection of a dance club in the window
im a terrible dancer
i dont dance
elise climbs out
you dont now
by the end of the night you will
they walk towards plan b a hip joint with zebra wallpaper and fake palm trees
salsa music pulses from inside
youre going to teach me to dance in one night
are you doubting me
she spins and shoves him against the wall
forcefully kisses him
then pulls free
she turns and walks into the club
david stands there
richardson sits across from donaldson
the disciplinary rules requ te me to
demote you in rank and re assign yot to a less desirable post
donaldson aingers the document he just signed
im going to interpret those rules loosely
im going to go easy on you because i feel the deck was stacked against you
in a wider shot we see that both burdensky and donaldsons aide sit nearby
im talking about the intense chemistry between them the constant inflection points and the kicker of course you pulling them apart only to have chance put them back together
that seemed impossible
so i asked burdensky to do some research this morning which he just completed
it seems like these two were meant to be together because they were meant to be together
were in the past in an earlier version of the plan
actually a dozen earlier versions
god knows how many artifacts pushing them together are left in the current plan
a live salsa band has just started
elise demonstrates mambo for david
couldnt be farther from the style of dance he just saw her rehearse
but shes amazing at it
salt patron lime
and two glasses dotin on the bar
she yanks him onto the dance floor
donaldson richardson burdensky
why was it changed
they went from meant to be together to red letter denied relationship in a single plan revision a few years back
as for why specifically thats apparently above even my pay grade
david and elise dance
he sucks but doesnt care
a couple of people in the club recognize him and give him thumbs up
burdensky and a dejected richardson walk down the hall
you spend your whole career hoping that one day youll get a red letter case
something you can really make a name for yourself with
finally i get one
another set of shot glasses hit the bar
up to reveal david and elise
okay weve al ready used up an hour we etter hurry
she pills him toward the exit
elise does a sexy street variation on a two step to an up tempo pop country ballad
david tries to follow along mostly by bobbing his head with the beat
sort of with the beat
youve got to let yourself feel the music
ive been told i have trouble feeling
whoever said that hasnt seen you speak
i mean what
with women although that might be changing
is there any style of dance you can t do
david and elise walk from the waterfront to the street
next stop the best s club in the city
to make an ass of myself for the third time in one night
race me to that light
you lose you dance i watch
you win i dance you watch what arethe rules of the race no rules
hmmm could get ugly
he looks down an alley as if hes noticed something
when she looks he takes off like a bat out of hell you bastard
hes got a good lead so he flips around and runs backwards
quit complaining and run
she catches up
he spins and digs it out
he cant dance but he sure can run
he pulls away and wins
he pumps his arms in a victory dance
that was good
that was very good
you said no rules
she punches him in the stomach
he crumples completely unprepared for it
christ on a crutch
you said you had trouble feeling
need a cab
helaughing through thepain
youre a maniac
you should come with a warning label
you just cant see it with my clothes on
off david biting his lip
and pre lapping the music david and elise walk into the synthesizer prelude to i cant wait by nu shooz
doesnt this song make you feel like youre at your high school prom
i was six when it came out
so not really
david just shakes his head and smiles as she pulls him to the dance floor
i i cant wait as the song kicks in and david and elise start dancing
a couple of kids next to them notice david and start pointing and signaling their approval the kids who first spotted david have alerted a few others
more people in the crowd cheer him on
donaldson stares pensively out the window looking down over the city
so were going operational
this is exciting
its been a while
we r t no ti go p etational no one ever
mad to my job by taking stupit i aris s
were going to kick this case upstairs
to someone with the latitude to clean up this mess without breaking into a sweat
were going to walk this upstairs to thompson
are we even allowed to go to him directly
hes a senior
isnt he the one
when he was in the field his nickname was the hammer
hell crush this romance with the flick of his hand
and hell thank me for giving him the opportunity
david and elise dancing
cause i cant wait
is what ive been waiting for people on the dance floor are literally screaming in support
david and elise stand on the pier outside the dance club
you grew up over there
she indicatesa residential area just behind the docks
i spent any entire childhood three blocks up carroll street
t move around a lot
what were you like as a
before sixth grade i spent about half my time in the principals office
the only person who spent as much time down there as me was a girl i had a huge crush on so i didnt mind too much
a smile spreads on elises face
re the docks did your dad work here
my dad filled vending machines
and youre going to be a senator
after my brother died my dad wanted to get me out of town for a while
we went to washington and the day we arrived he took meto the
we ended up sitting in the senate gallery all day
re financial district across the river we could see that from the end of my block but be never once encouraged me to go to wall street
his idol was jfk
he thought business guys were selfish
areyou doing all this f
i want to matter
i dont think thats just forrhim
tucks her head into his shoulder
i dont want tonight to mess anything
up for you for the campaign
just make sure i make it to diane sawyer on time and ill be fine
elise looks at him for a long beat
somehow you make me believe
push in on the window of an apartment
david and elise make love focus so shallow that even their faces are not always sharp
david and elise lie together spent
vulnerability we barely glimpsed before this i dont let people in david
and i never let them in this quickly
david pulls her close
he cant see her eyes
but we can
shes struggling with something more
i haven t lead a perfect life i
dont want perfect
emotion wei ing im trying to say
im not sure somebody running
for office can have me in their life
david turns her around so he can see her face so he knows for sure she hears this i havent stopped thinking about you since the moment i met you
i want you in my life there are skeletons in my closet david
the kind that listen to me
the kind that people use against elise listen
i dont care
well work it out
ive spent my whole life wondering why it takes auditoriums of people to fill the empty space inside me
then i met you
and realized it doesnt
she looks at him
he means it
you scare me
after a beat that wasnt the effect i was going for
then laughs out loud david and eliseirsleep peacefully
thompson late s standing next to the bed in a suit with a fedora on
exits through the frt door
three aides are waiting for him
tho mft ns aide what do you aiat to do
let it happen again
thompsons aides seem surprised by the answer
david wakes to find elise looking at him
you been up long
did you wake up in
the middle of the night
slept straight through
i thought you never sleep through
i told you you scare me
he kisses her
i wont hurt you
they kiss more
and then get swept up by it
they lie in bed post coital drained
until the phone rings
early for a call
why are you calling
look i have to go
she hangs up
david looks at her
that was my ex
i didnt i guess we hadnt gotten to that stuff yet
he hasnt called since we broke up
was it serious
an awkward beat
elise opts for complete honesty
we were engaged
david can feel this in the pit of his stomach now
what an idiot
you dont know me that well yet
youre still in the wishful thinking phase
truth is i should
have left him a long time before he left me
it was a ain l relationship
it hurt tb be i h it every day
but it was hard to leave
h knew what buttons
dttid paints at pica re of elise with an attractive man arms wound each other
lise looks surprised shocked even to ty e photo on her b okcase
its over between us
i want to be clear about that
im pretty sure yesterday was the most perfect day ive ever had
david looks at the clock
i have this diane sawyer interview
it comes out awkward
so did that
they look at each other
then david reaches for his clothes can i come
my dress rehearsals not until nine
davids face lights up
im afraid if i let you out of my sight
i might never see you again
a smile creeps across his face
diane sawyer interviewsdavid
youve overcome enormous obstacles in your life and risen to such heights so quickly
people are fascinated by you
only people who havent spent enough time with me to know the truth
elise watches the nterview on a big monitor
a soundproof window allows her tb see directly into the studio
as a speaker and politician youve been repeatedly compared to jfk
by my campaign manager mostly
youre the youngest person ever elected to congress
which you celebrated by getting in a bar fight on inauguration night
with a childhood friend
so i dont think that counts
and truthfully thats how we celebrate things were im from
grinning bigger now lets just say you have a habit of getting into the press for
other uniquely human things as well that a euphemism diane
run aw ay from the embarrassing things theyve done yoti crack jokes about them
you embrace them
especially since your
concession speech thr ee years ago which started as a sstd up routine and brought tears to my eyes by the end when you talked about losing your mother to
lancer and then your older brother pdt to an overdose both whei
you were only ten years old
i think americans are tired of electing automatons whose every word and move is stage managed so as not to offend anyone
i think they want somebody who doesnt hide who he is or what he really believes
i guess im hoping they want to elect someone whos actually like them
but i could be very wrong about that
and if you are
youd be surprised at the number of underwear companies that have approached me to be their spokesman
diane bursts out laughing
the floor techs are laughing too
and so is elise
shes completely smitten
on the tv diane turns to the camera trying to stop laughing
unfortunately were out of time
david norris announced his candidacy for us senate yesterday
thanks for stopping by
it goes to commercial
david stays to speak to diane for a moment as we move to find a stagehandwho is shifting the position of one of the big video cameras sed to tape
we catch a glimpse of his face and see its thompsons aide
maam congressman norris asked me to give you a message
we move up from his id to reveal that the man is another one of thompsons aides
he was just called into a meeting that he says is urgent
he says hell call you later and see you at your show tonight
david and diane say goodbye to each other
he salutes the floor staff who actually applaud
they love him
to david re earpiece theyre saying your girlfriend can we call her that
is this one going to last more than a month
you can call her that
david is looking at a text from elise as he speaks
it says i want to go to bed with you
theyre saying shes getting a tour of the control room in studio c
can somebody take congressman norris to studio c
thompsons aide signals david to follow him
they walk through a couple thick doors into the corridor
thompsons aide leads him through a heavy door marked studio c into a vestibule and then through another heavy door into a partially built set in the center of an
elise isnt here
thompsons aide feigns surprise
they said she was here
david pulls his blackberry out sees there is no signal
he looks up to see thompsons aide exit through the stage door
it suddenly clicks for david and he rushes to the door
yanks on it
through the thick window of the outer door we can see david pounding on the window of the inner door
but we cant hear a sound
pull back to reveal thompsons aide removing the studio c placard
beneath is the true designation studio d
pan to reveal three thompson aides removing a false wall that was hiding a bunch of construction equipment and setting up no entry construction zone signs
david across the room tugs on another exit
david pulls a fire alarm
david slams on the door with a two by four
diane sawyet talks about the issue of the day as we pull back and show her
co hosts on the couch
elise arrives in the lobby of the manhattan modern ballet for her companys dress rehearsal
his jacket off
he glances at his blackberry
the time reads pm
he yells in frustration
if people could hear you out there it wouldnt be a very good soundstage would it
david turns to see thompson in the now familiar dark suit and fedora
my names thompson
what happened to free will
who said anything about free will
david stares back at him
you know we actually tried free will before
after taking you from hunting and gathering to the height of the roman empire we stepped back to see how youd do on your own
you gave us the dark ages for five centuries until finally we decided we should come back in
the chairman thought maybe we just needed to do a better job of teaching you how to ride the bike before we took the training wheels off again
so we gave you the renaissance the enlightenment the scientific revoluton
i we spent six hundred years tempering your passions with reason
then in we stepped ba i c again
within fifty yearsi you brought us world war i the lepression fascism the holocaust ani capped it off by bringingtheentire planet to the brink of destruction in the cuban missile
a decisiofl was taken atthat point that we should stop in again before aou did soittething even we cduldnt fix
you ont have free will david you have the appearance of free will
you expect me
to believe that
you have free will over what tie you pick in the morning or what beverage to order at lunch
but humanity just isnt mature enough to have control over the important things
if youre in control of the important things then youre incompetent cause when i look around at the world these days it seems pretty fucked
its still here
if wed left things in your hands it wouldnt be
why are you trying to keep me from elise
or are you just another lackey who doesnt really know
thompson studies david for a long beat
then decides its time to level with him
we put elise in front of you three years ago to inspire you to
g ve that speech the speech that pulled you back from the brink of oblivion and overnight itiade
you the front runner for this coming election
the intervention on charlie was to prevent the hedge fund you had just become vice chairman of from going belly up in the sub prime crisis bringing two major banks
with it arid in the process making you unelectable
tries to process this
bavid are you s aying you warit me to win this election
this one and six mom after it
and tm not just talking about elections for senate
lowly dawns on david what thompson is saying
you can matter david
what you wanted your whole life
what your father wanted when he took you to the senate gallery when you were ten
what your brother wanted when he made you promise the day before he overdosed that you wouldnt be like him
dont tell me this
why do you think you have that yearning to be in front of people
and that terrible emptiness when youre not
david you are meant to change the world
but that doesnt happen if you stay with her
why does it matter to you who i love
some skeleton of hers is so bad i wont get elected
i dont believe that
its not about her
its about you what being with her does to what does that mean
im better with her than i ever was alone
you just said it
that speech yes
put it this wad in small doses elise was the cure
but in large doses
when youre enthralledwith someone she rubs off on you
david the president cant be a stop talking
its not working
im a politician
i spend my life with professional liars
with people who decide what they want and then figure out the story they have to tell to get it
why do you refuse to accept what should be completely obvious by now
youve seen what we can do
you cant doubt we are who we say we are
i dont care who you are
i dont care whos orders youre following
you cant outrun your fate david
who said anything about running
maybe we should just reset you
we both know if you could have we wouldnt be standing here having this conversation
thompson stares back
hes never dealt with such temerity
you fight us we will take everything from you
you already did once
and im still standing
always knew you were out there
we all do
its the one thing we have in common
whether we call it god or the devil or fate we all know youre out there fucking with us
youd still be living in caves if it werent for us
you crush our dreams because they dont fit with your plan
your plan that has no space for me falling in love but somehow has room for tsunamis and cyclones and darfur and aids
fuck your plan
i reject it
i reject you
the only thing we have in this fucked up world are the choices we make
and theres nothing you can do to me that will get me sign them away
or erase me
or let me go
thompson stares back at him dumbfounded
a long silence its
if you leave now youll make elises show
davids eyebrows go up
thompson is letting him go
david jumps into a taxi
david sits in the back seat taking everything in turning it over and over in his head
elise and twb of her colleagues finish a dance piece
the audience explodes into applause
the house lights come up half way as the stage is readied for the next piece
david is startled to see that the man in the aisle seat next to him is thompson
shes a beautiful dancer
what do you want
theres one more piece to all this i havent told you
i guess i didnt have the heart
if you stay with her it doesnt just kill your dreams it kills hers
elise is about to become one of the most famous dancers in the country
and eventually one of the greatest choreographers in the world
if she stays with you
she ends up teaching dance to eight year olds
i dont believe you
i thought we already established that
when you look back at all this david just remember we tried to reason with you
thompson gets up and leaves
just as the lights go down for the next dance
david watches him go
then turns around just in time to catch elises entrance into the dance a graceful jump
when she lands her ankle cracks and she falls
the audience gasps
insert a floor board tilted oddly
it goes back to normal
find thompson his hand slightly outstretched
the audience instantly knows something is wrong
david jumps up and runs down to the
a dancer comes from off stage and helps elise off the floor as the show continues
a company staff member is examining elises ankle while the show goes on
sees elises face
tears streaming down her cheeks
if its broken
my careers over
dont say that
the taxi rushes to the hospital
david holds her
silently trying to comfort her
but he cant look at her
david carries her from the taxi into the emergency room
david sits in a black chair alone staring at the floor
elise lies on an exam table as a tech x rays her ankle
david is still staring at the floor
he looks up to see thompson
i always hear people saying you yourself for what cant bla m hpens fih other people but in this case really you can
david stands up
and punnhesthompson in the face
h t ompson is knocked onto his ass
people in the waiting room stare at david
almost everyone here knows his fade
he looks at them unable to summon his usual wit
this is what you do david
this is what you did the first night you got elected
this is what you did at that college reunion
we give you opportunities people would kill for and you squander them with impulse
it doesnt take a genius to see elise isnt exactly going to help you with that
you want to know why you cant have her
look in the mirror
more x rays of elises ankle
an orthopedic surgeon enters and examines the images on the computer screen
elise her face still red and tear stained tries to read the how bad is it
the surgeon turns to her with a classic doctors detachment david sits alone on a bench
youre an educated man
youve read the greek tragedies
in the end fate always wins
david looks back at him in steely silence
it a sprain
do you really want to watch her lose the only thing shes ever cared about
you just got the tiniest taste of what that looks like
the thought makes david ill
if you truly love her walk away
shell hate you for it
but that way shell be able to let you go quickly
you can give her that at least
david stands alone
stares at the floor
finally confronting the fact that he cant beat the forces arrayed against him
finally ready to make the choice being forced upon him
david enters to find elise with a huge smile on her face
its a sprain
its just a sprain
david gives her a tight hug
its going to be okay
the doctor said it would heal in a month
maybe even less
youre going to be fine
they want to do an mri
to assess the ligament
they break from them hug
its going to be fine
and as incredible of a dancer as you already are yotre just going to get better and better
davidv embraces her again so she wont see the tears welling in his eyes
i have to go make a few calls
his voice cracks
happy for you
david walks down a long corridor away from elises room
david exits the building
thompson is waiting by the door
youre doing the right thing david
not just for her and the world
but for yourself
david looks at him for a beat then turns and walks away into the night
close on a tv screen then pull back to reveal the diner
david norris whohas spent the last two days campaigning in the tri lakes area got some welcome news yesterday when the latest new york times poll gave him a sixteen
point lead over his opponent less than
a month before election dg t
he sits at a booth eating breakfast as he watches tv behind the counter
charlie glan ces out the window ad we find david standing on the back of apickup truck speaking to eighty people in the parking lot
its autumn now
so etthing about his speaking style has changed
hes not as ima ea or passion te
hedoesnt seem to enjoy it as much is he adid three years ago
just then a campaign aide arrives at charlies table
hows he doing
they still love him
the aide hands charlie a stack of papers three local papers the times the journal and the three big nyc tabloids
the aide leaves
charlie glances at the front page of the times then reaches for the new york region section
as he does the front page of the arts section catches his eye
there is a big photo of elise doing an airborne split accompanying an article titled dance takes a quantum leap
charlie glances through the window at david who is climbing down from the pickup truck to applause from his parking lot audience
david shakes hands with people in the aftermath of his speech
they really do love him
charlie reads the new york times
it begins once in a generation a piece is created of such astounding originality and virtuosity that it single handedly reshapes
world of dance
as he makes his way towards the dinerf tom the parking lot shaking handb and allowing his picture to be taken
david sits down with charlie
im going to show you this because youd find out eventually and because i want to be here when you do
charlie turns the arts section around for david to see it
elises photo has a noticeable impact on david
he glances at the article for a moment
then charlie points down near the bottom at a particular
the shows choreographer adrian troussant and lead dancer elise sellas are partners on and off stage and plan to marry in new york next week
david stares at the words
off no response david
i think i need
take a day off
take a couple
were sixteen points up
even i cant blow a lead that big
its pouring rain
david walks down carroll street
most of the row houses display norris for senate signs
most of the housing here is run down but this block is clearly in the earlystages of gentrification
david pays particular attention to one row house as he passes by
was this his house
theres a norris for senate sign prominently displayed in the window
david enters this classic dive bar and goes to the bartender
do you still serve neighborhood guys here or just the tourists
the bartender smiles big
a couple people at the bar notice him
then others notice and they start whooping it up for him
he doesnt know any of them but they sure know him
david sits under the huge aluminum roof on one of the piers holding a bottle of beer in a soaked paper bag
there are no walls to this structure so rainwater pours off the roof on all four sides forming virtual walls
a figure in a suit approaches david from behind
he turns to see the man
why are you here
reverse to reveal harry in a suit and raincoat
i would have come earlier but i had to wait for the rain
off davids confusion water interferes with their ability to sense your decision tree
thats why we met on a boat last time
i guess im here to set the record straight
thompson was lying when he said they couldnt let you be with lise because it would bring out your reckless side
why do they care so much
shes enough david
if you have her r tau rtt
ght not need to fill the d side you with votes and ataplauseand dreams of one day becoming p sident
if harry has looked straight into davids soul
ive watched you a long time
theyre right to want you in the white house
it would be good for the world
thats important but it cant be the only thing that matters
why are you so different than they are
a long beat then you know your dad was a smart man
he could have been a lot more and he wanted to be
so did your brother
but the plan didnt call for that
this hits david hard
in my job you implement the plan
and most of the time
you dont even know why
that wasnt me
that wasnt us at all
david takes all this in
after a long be t he takes a drink
then he offers the bottle to harry who h a esitates then takes a drink as well
when thompson told methe choice as elise or the white house i barely hesitated
but the trt t i is after making that choice i went into a free fall
dont get me wrong it killed me to see thompson hurt her
but i used it as an excuse
i think i left her more to save my career than hers
thompson wasnt lying
the press is already talking about me as a future president
im phoning in my speeches and im still sixteen points up in the polls
the public loves you
before i met elise that was all that mattered
now i hardly notice
shes all i think about
do you know where shes getting married
front of a judge
is she happy with him
tell me she is and ill walk away
thompson wont let you get near that courthouse
is she happy
i have to get her back
harry knows how unlikely that is
will you help me i just help me get to her
theyll sense tou coming a mile away
what if icould move as fast as you can
what do you mean
teach me about the doors
how do you know about that
the first day after they caught me they carried me through one
i thought it was a hallucination at first
eventually i realized its how you move around so fast
off harrys reluctance if you dont want to help me because of what theyll do to you
okay thats your choice
but if this is about protecting me then shouldnt the choice be mine
do you have any idea how complicated it is to navigate through those doors
how many thousands of permutations there are in even a simple several block journey
you know when i do town hall meetings i usually get introduced to forty or fifty people between when i walk through the door and when i start speaking
but when im done with the speech i can call on each one of them by game
ive seen you do that taking tl leap the rain is supposed to stop in the nexthour
were going to need all night to do this
and were going to need aplace surrounded by water to do it
harry and david stand outside a door to a dock office at the end of the pier
harry dons his hat
put your hand on my shoulder
and dont let go until weve crossed the threshold
harry opens the door
are they ever locked
maybe if you have a defective hat
they step through the door and onto harry notices as the rain slows to a drizzle
harry runs david to the front dooraf a brownstone
opens the door
they move through i into harry stops
david takes his hand off harrys shoulder
still amazed by what they just did
were underneath canal street which c as a canal before rt was a street
this is the jcitys pumping station for downtown manhattan
were ten blocks from the courthouse
elise enters smiles at the receptionist
seeing elises red eyes you okay sweetie
i just feel like being on the floor
everything still on for tomorrow
elise nods trying to cover her ambivalence
music begins something that recalls the sensei pupil scenes in martial arts movies but at the same time something fluid and lyrical e
yoshida brothers beyond the deep sea
harry rolls out a block by block map of lower manhattan
there are intricate red pen markings all over the map
lower manhattan is a nightmare
layer upon layer of substrate thats what we call the system of doors has been added over time
that makes it a lot more complex to navigate down here than it is uptown
and a lot slower
harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors interior and exterior all below canal street
harry smiles and hblds
up a photograph of
the manhattan county court building in foley squa e
the music continues
source music here
elise dances to it freestyle
the fluidity and extension of ballet but none of its formality or stiffness
struggling to remember north moore st
just south of the coffee shop
i come out on broadway near leonard st
harry looks at a photo of what david just described
elise continues to dance
eyes closed trying to theres an alley in front of me
third door on thompsons there
thinks then has it i hightail it east to lafayette no its crosby street there
dance company nit ht elise dances
one wearing a hat is
h e rea lizes w hat g oin g on thompson is gong to pull out all the stops
h going to get reinforcement jots of them
i dont care if usee a auv wearing a yankees ca a yarmulke or a bowler as hes working for them
okay you said hes right in front of me right
id knock the yankees cap off his head and go through the door before he has a chance to pick it up
a thinsmile forms on harrys face and grows
we have trouble with that
how am i doing
dont get cocky
you know ten permutations out of ten thousand
get back to work
harry drilling david with photdafter photo of manhattan doors intercut with elise dancing
until she finally quits from physical and emotional exhaustion
david rubs his head
hes exhausted too
yourbrain can only put so much in at once
take a brreak
his eyg s to harry s leather planbook
he btio ts to it a question can he look at it
harry opens tt up to a page in the middle
davids eyes look over the impossibly complex circ t diagram
could i ever learn to read that
harry shakes his head
no matter how hard i tried
for the same reason you cant breathe underwater or flap your arms and fly
youre not built to do it
re circuit diagram is that me
her decision tree
what it was a few hours ago before the rain before we were down here
david looks at it then looks away
i want to ask you what it says
what shes thinking
bit somehow that feels
you know what shes thinkin g david as much as you need to know
youre built to feel that
elise exits to the street pulls a scarf around her neck
david closes the p nbook
ready to get back to work
sometl ing about that strikes harry
your father used to say that
off davids reaction elise enters turns on the light
she picks up the computer printout of her court appointment to be married
a post it note on top of the printout reads our last night apart
david and harry examine photos of a blue door at the side of a tribeca restaurant
the fastest path is getting to the blue door right off the bat
but youre exposed the whole way there
its a lot riskier than leapfrogging through doors but if i can make it
il have caught them completely bysurprise
assuming you make it
elise turns out the light curling up in her bed
fade music the early morning sun slices through the urban canyons
adrian the guy fromthe photo in elises apartment dtands at the court f egtstrpsr s window
do you have your license
adrian hands her his marriage license
is your fiancee here
getting out of a cab downstairs
the registrar glances at the license to make sure its in order
then stamps it judge williams docket
harry comes down from topside with his planbook in hand
david is waiting anxiously down here
you got lucky
its raining again
the marriage is scheduled for ten minutes from now
you cant jump the gun on this
getting there too early is almost as bad as getting there too late
harry looks at his updated planbook and consults his watch
elise and lauren step into a polished brass elevator from new yorks tammany hall days
her look is distant disconnected
not what youre suppoeed to look like on your wedding day
david is rearing to go
finally harms watch alarm beeps
david breathes a sigh of relief
harry takes the hat off h znrhead wand hands it to david
im going for the blue door
music cue something with relentless pounding energy of the verve remix of sarah vaughns fever
david blows through a drab utility door into an alley
he careens around a corner onto greenwich street and starts an all out sprint rain pelts the window as thompson reads the newspaper
thompsons aide rushes in
it was a momentary flash and given the weather we cant be sure but it looks like mr
norris may be david runs through a puddle as he races down greenwich st
through the pouring rain
out of his office followed by his aide
do we have a proctor at the wedding
adrian kisses elise
notices her face you okay
just a little queasy
im not sure
i just need a minute in the bathroom
big old marble sinks heavy wood doors
elise enters tears welling in her eyes
thompson rushes down the hall
three aides with him now
from here its faster in the cars
david can see the blue door
he races toward it
thompson rushes out the front
door of a perfect ar t deco tower and jumps into his black mercedes
to his assistant where is heribw
they jump in and the car peels out followed by two others
hes through it like liihtning and comes out he comes out of a building directly across from the courthouse from harrys photos
thompson and mcmanus speeding north
thompsons aide is speechless as he stares at his planbook
he just went into the substrate
off thompsons reaction a soaking wet david blows through the front door and skids to a stop at the security line adrian and lauren wait in the courtroom
docket please come forward the guy next to adrian stands up
adrian throws a panicked look at lauren
will you check on her
tht epeople in lima in front of him
hes not going to ke t
david goes to the front
its an emergency
we all have emergencies pal

lauren wipes tears from elises face
am i making the biggest mistake of my life
i cant answer that question for you elise
but i will say pulling self together if you have doubts im okay
im just nervous
you havent done this yet
im going to clean up
tell adrian ill be right there
david throws his keys on
x ray belt goes through the metal detector then bi s ts without waiting for his keys congressman
your lauren returfs to sit next to adrian
she holds up one finger one more minute
move to reveal a suspicious looking man stepping into the o aartroom in a fedora
he scans the room in en y t tl then suits his planbot k
k ba ihff ma k h es all re mov e his hat david races up the stairs docket please come forward
adrian looks at lauren
motions urgently for lauren to get elise from the bathroom
thompsons three mercedes skid to a stop outside
lauren exits the courtroom just as david bounds up the last few stairs to reach the fifth floor
where is she
water drips from his clothes onto the marble floor
you want to explain to me where is she
explain to her lauren points at the adies room
david nods thanks and elise turns to see him and stops cold
why are you doing this to me
just then the door bursts open
the suspicious man from the david elbows him in the face
the man drops
david calmly turns back to her
youre not supposed to be weeping on your wedding day elise
elise fights the emotion again welling inside
you were never happy with adrian
you told me that
elise puts her head in her hands
this is so screwed up
i love you
i know ive acted strangely
but i love you
dont do this to me
ive never felt anything like
this in my life
if you care so much why the hell did you disappear on me in that hospital
what are you ha
d g from me
why did you dis pp ear again
you fucking bastard
tears are streaming down her face
theyll reset me
theyll scramble my brain david stop talking like this
david looks back at her
just looks at her
then he leans over and wipes a tear from her face
and he decides
he just decides
but at least youll know the truth
i saw behind the curtain elise
i saw this
he opens up harrys planbook
elise sees the intricate wiring diagrams
sees the lines shift on the page
it startles her
its not in their plan for us to be together
so theyre trying to stop us
thompson and minions rush up the stairs
he just revealed us
elise stares back at him
stop talking like a crazy person
stop making things up they said if we were together they d take dance from you and politic s from me
they hurt your ankle that night
they the door flies open again
david picks up a trash can and clobbers the fedora wearing man who enters
thompson spins to his aide finger in his face
call the intervention team
tell them its a square one reset
an nypd shield on the belt of one guy david knocked out
the cops are after you
david grabs the shield and uses it to wedge the door closed
kicks it in so its jammed tight
hes not a cop
hes one of them
another body slams into the door now
but the shield holds it shut
the door cracks jesus david
whats going on
david is impossibly calm
he puts his hat back on
im going to show you
he takes elises hand opens the bathroom door and walks her across the threshold into davidand elise step
a door onto a street in soho
unable to speak
we need to lose them
david walks her across the street and picks a door at random david and elise exit through a door
her jaw drops
reverse to reveal central parks sheep meadow spread before them
theyve exited from the building on its north edge
elise steps out onto the grass touches it falls to her knees in the rain completely overwhelmed
a bevy of men in hats push the ladies room door open and rush in
theyre shocked to see its empty
eliselooks at david the rain slows them down but they can track us
we have two orthree minutes
elise is still speechless
he takes her hand
the ten year old in me always mixed up winning elections with being loved
then i met you
the thing is if theyd let me be with you i wouldntk have left politipe
t just would have beef in it or
all the right reasons
david pauses for a moment
he can see this so clearly in his head
how can it notbe right
now you know
and you have to leave mitie
theyll take dance from you
you saw what they did before
fihe foundations of her world have just collapsed
but somehow she pulls herself together to say this no
youre not safe with me
if you she puts her finger to his lip
it doesnt make any sense but right now i feel safer than ive ever felt before
the chairmans office is the size of the reading room at the new york public library
thirty foot high
a dozen assistants perform various tasks very quietly giving it more the feel of a papal court than a corporate office
we see the chairman from behind only
but we can still tell he is utterly calm and in complete control
an aide comes to the chairmans desk
sets two open leather folios in front of him
thompson has made an emergency request for the intervention team
one of the folio
documents is titled reset authorization
a dressing room door opens
david and elise both soaking exit past a startled attendant
they walk through the store and out onto tiey look for another door
as they walk into another
thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the rain scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry
the chairman holds a silver pen as he flips through the case file
david and elise head towards a door across the street from the banana republic
they emerge through a door on the th street metro north platform
run down the stairs to street level
thompson and a half dozen minions emerge from the same dressing room david and elise did
the seventeen year old attendant presses back against the wall totally freaked now
david and elise head toward a storefront church
thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing nypd badges and asking questions
david and elise enter the church and exit from a metal door in a stone facade
pull back to reveal that they are standing at the base of the statue of liberty
elise looks out at the harbor and the city
rain pelts her face
and she smiles
like a prisoner who has just broken her chains
rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by thompson and his men
a black suburban with under grill police lights pulls up fast
the intervention team has pinpointed an interception point
thompson circles his finger in the air to tell his men to saddle up theyre moving out elise isstill smiling
we cant keep running forever
if they find us
theyll take you from me
i wont let
theyll take you from here
david touches his head
no i wont let them
over and kisses his forehead
david and elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it
david picks a door
he tries another
its locked too
he tries a third
elise tries shakes her head
theyre not supposed to be locked
david hears sounds coming from the buildings central staircase
he looks down it to see four men in silver suits climbing up the stairs
the elevator door down the hall opens
more men in silver suits
this ones open
elise is standing at the door to the roof
david runs to her and they go up the stairs together to david pushes the roof door shut barricades it with some concrete blocks sitting on the roof
rain pours down on them
they rush to the edge of the roof
three con edison vans are parked haphazardly on the street below
and a dozen civilians on the sidewalk are frozen
david grabs elise and they go to the side of the roof the roof of the building next door is ten feet below them
they hang their legs over the edge and jump
they sprint across the roof of the building next door except somehow they find themselves running across the same roof they were just on
david sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a moment ago
the door bangs against theme being shoved open from inside
david and elise run back in the c pposite direction
at the buildings edge they climb over again and
only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were on
its like theyre in an
they stop and look at each other
david takes her hand as adjustment team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent roofs
theyre completely surrounded
tears well in her eyes
close your eyes and kiss me
and they kiss in the rain
i love you david norris
they hold each other for a long beat
and then finally open their eyes
ready to accept their fate they see an empty roof
the silver suits are gone
and the rain has stopped
a strange silence envelopes them
they spin the other direction to see the chairman standing there alone
good morning elise
his voice is gentle paternal
who are you
i think you know
david and elise stand in awe as they realize
you cant oti rn fate
tft chairman its
more complicated t an that fate am free will coexist theyre in tension with each other
and pure chance
david looks back at him
i hat rman i could control everything
youd be ha ou d be puppets
i try to
keep things from getting too out of control
but that has a cost
most people go through life like pinballs reacting predictably to the stimuli i apply
they accept the path they find themselves on
and perform accordingly
but every once in a while someone comes along who refuses to be bound by his fate someone who understands that free will is a gift most people are too
afraid to use
which you see is partly the point of all this
the chairman contd or maybe you dont see it
maybe you just feel it
and thats even better
because thats the other part
david and elise take it in
and all the misery all the pain
i sit up there and i watch it and it hurts me
but if you could see the incredible courage people show the random acts of kindness the love
if you could see huitan beings choosing every moment every day to be better than i made them you would know its all worthwhile
good luck david
and good luck to you elise
youre a beautiful dancer
and so much more
the chairman turns to his aide who we didnt know was there
their case isclosed
but sir isnt this a majtr
deviation from the plan
the chairmen turns to another aide who is holding a folio open and signs a document on ery heavy paper
not anymc e
david and elise watc i the chairman walk away still awed by what theyve just experienced
as he disappears around a corner the sun comes out from behind the clouds
after a long beat elise turns back to david as if to say what do we do now
maybe we should go dancing
a smile slowly spreads across her face
