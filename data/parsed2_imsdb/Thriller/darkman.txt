written by joshua daniel goldin sam ivan raimi and chuck pfarrer february a shock chord as we cut from black to a harshly toplit a man is talking into a
he is a paunchy but powerful looking black man bald with a gray fringe
his baldness makes his head look muscular he is a tough man whose life has been shaped by the violence of the docks
his name is eddie black
in the distance a foghorn moans
we are pulling back
cause hes an asshole
tell him no
tell him no too
him tell fuck you
the continuing pull back shows that we are inside a huge empty pier building
black is leaning against the roof of his car which is parked in the middle of the vast empty space
the room is lit by bare bulbs its farthest reaches falling into darkness
no ill be a few minutes here
guy comin up thinks hes gonna muscle me outs my property
does it matter
just another tough guy
another hard looking man is approaching
theyre drivin up
get their pieces
we got a surprise for those fuckers
we are tracking towards a chain link fence which is swinging open to admit two midnight blue lincoln continentals
the cars stop in the foreground and eight men get out eerily backlit in the mist of the riverfront
is a well dressed and immaculately groomed man of forty
wears a powder blue polyester leisure suit
his nose has been broken several times from his years in the mexican boxing league
he was almost a contender
walks with a pronounced limp
is a large black man with a quiet studied cool
is a wiry twenty year old who looks about in short jerky motions
he huddles in behind the others
he is stylishly dressed with slicked back black hair
his protruding adams apple bobs as he swallows
wears a permanent psychotic smile
is middle aged and balding
his spare tire hangs over the edge of his suit pants
he subdues a belch
he raises a bottle of maalox and slugs down fifty cents worth
a ring of white chalky fluid coats his lips
has a thatch of blond hair he spits out tobacco juice between his wide spaced front teeth
they are approached by a group of fifteen dock workers blacks men with massive shoulders and grain sack bellies
looks like they just got off their shift and now theyre ready to kick some ass
okay against the car ladies
youre c gonna stand for a search
the eight visitors assume the position placing their hands on the roof of their car
the dock workers pat them down and haul off iron lots of it
bunch a cuties
put skirts on em id marry one
from the other dock workers hearty male laughter
the visitors bare up in silence
as the visitors are led in into the beams of the car headlights escorted by the dock workers
the dock workers take up positions around durant and his men
stands waiting for them
he eyes skip the limper
i was engaged to a girl with a wooden leg once
i hadda break it off
the dock workers laugh
black indulges his wens laughter then cuts okay lets cut the crap here
durant i got just three things to say to you
one he holds up a chubby finger
i aint selling my property
he flashes a second finger
nobody muscles eddie black especially a bunch of fucks
he flashes a third finger
number three if you guys is unha with that which i can already is then we can cutcha balls of f if thatll be more satisfactory
the last shot echoes away to leave silence except for the arhythmic echoing scuffle of skips one shoe as he continues to hop in place for balance
smiley after a watchful pause to make sure everyone is dead sticks out his left arm at waist level
skip grabs the arm for support stops hopping and there is now
the elegantly suited leader takes out a cigar and a gold plated cigar trimmer
snip he trims the and of the cigar and sticks it in his mouth
as he walks towards the dumbly apprehensive black now lets consider my points one by one
puts a full nelson on black
trumayne grabs blacks right hand and holds it out fingers splayed towards durant
he slips one of blacks fingers into his cigar trimmer
try not to let my anger get the better of me
as durant goes for another finger two i dont always succeed
reaching for another finger three ive got seven more points
looking down on the lonely waterfront building we hear blacks screams
making jerky little movements this way and that
we pull focus through the nose then back to sharp focus again
the nose fills the screen every pore a cavern every blemish a mountain
the nostrils flare slightly
suddenly it is hit by a flash of light as b deeee we hear the automatic wind of a camera and its strobe recharging
we get rapid fire left and right nose profiles
we are in a lab
peyton westlake an earnest scientist in his early thirties is straightening up from behind a futuristic looking tripod mounted camera
he front the camera and instantly hits a button nt of ut
thenfro eof o the nose belongs to yakitito yanagita a japanese graduate student wearing a lab smock and glasses with thick coke bottle lenses
now if everything goes according to plan in a couple of months your nose will be on the lips of every american
he is feeding the prints into the input slot of a computer
the nose is broken down into thousands of points
as each point of the nose is removed from the screen a number is assigned
weve finally got the imager working how we want it
we pan to the holographic imaging cylinder
the glass cylinder wired to the computer glows to life
p a three dimensional holographic image of yakatitos nose p rotates within
peyton glances from the imager to the computer
he types on the computer keyboard
bio press checks out okay
he glances to
as it hums to life
it is a box containing linear rows of densely packed pins
tiny servo motors beneath the pins allow each pin to rise or fall individually per computer command
a smooth synthetic substance is being sprayed evenly atop the surface of the pins
the sprays halts the wet substance glistens
the densely packed pins rise to programmed heights molding the solidifying synthetic substance into an exact replica of yakatitos nose
no more bunching
i dont know about perfect but it looks like your nose
down to the millimole
no the bio press wont be a problem
its the synthetic skins instability
if the just hold up y give me victim and a photograph of his old face hell get more than a nose
were talking complete reconstruction damaged skin tissue
make him better looking
hey whats the time
fumbles for the stopwatch that hangs around his neck
ninety eight minute and change
lets check in our friends
moves to a microscope
cells swimming in an agar protoplasm bath
that is connected to the microscope
amino acid content
membrane potential millivolts dna content
millimoles collagen congeners
peyton punches in some data and
on the left half a rotating three dimensional computer generated image of a protein molecule
beneath it the on the right half of the screen another image forms
it is a second molecule
beneath it the words the molecules rotate in synchronization
a loud beeping tone
suddenly the synthetic molecule begins to waver and spin randomly
the unstable cells fragment
peyton shoves himself away from the microscope
yakitito checks his stopwatch
ninety nine minute
he stares dumbly at the stopwatch frozen
he repeats ninety nine minute
cells always break up at a ninety nine minute
he punches away at a keyboard and takes the readout
electrolytes temp and glucose concentration
but still this ninety nine minute
yakitito makes a notation of the time on a lab sheet
pacing thinking why
what is destabilizing it
vivification process was cake
we licked that
were smart guys
so why cant we make these cells stable
lets try a ten percent alkalinity
get those suckers too drunk to fragment
posts the completed lab sheet on a wall covered with hundreds of similar sheets
we already try ten
he pokes at a section of lab sheets
and twenty two
we try all phase of alkalinity
he punches the wall
but still a ninety nine minute
three month ago ninety nine minute
ten month ago
ninety nine minute
yakitito punches the wall again and again
peyton calmly taps a plastic dunking bird that slowly bobs
a word of advice yakitito
dont get emotionally involved
remain object he is cut off as yakitito punches the wall again and again to punctuate his speech
maybe i am lousy scientist
listen to father get in anaheim
get drunk on sake nightly forget i am failure
a basketball appears in peytons hands
he tosses it to catches the ball
the most striking characteristic of thermionic emission
throws the ball away
no always you ask me question to ma me calm down
i no want to calm down
catches the ball dribbles and throws it back to yakitito
the answer yakitito
snags the ball angrily from the air
it is most strongly depending on temperature
he throws it at peyton who grabs it and pump fakes yakitito not letting him have the ball
again he pump fakes
this means the temperature of the emitter is not critical as long as it is sufficiently high and as long as pure metals with high operating temperatures such as tungsten
or tantalum are used
peyton tosses him the ball
yakitito catches it
it work every time
louis strack sr
a no nonsense octogenarian and his son louis strack jr
a powerfully built debonair fifty stride into the lobby
they are accompanied by a couple of aides
julie hastings a young attractive woman who has apparently been awaiting their arrival rises from a chair and crosses the lobby to greet them
she is dressed in a conservative business suit and carries a briefcase
strack my name is julie hastings
im here from pappas and swain to represent you in the von hoffenstein negotiation
how do you do
and please call me louis
this is my father who strack sr
interrupts his sons introduction
i dont want some fancy ass woman to do my negotiating
wheres herb gorson
gorsons tied up in litigation this week
dont worry ive done my homework
scowls ungraciously accepting her
ill stop worrying when you get von balibreakers price down to sixty million
he turns and starts striding down the hallway the others following
if he goes that low lock him up
the stracks and julie are seated at a table next to a large picture window that looks out on the bridle path
jodhpured equestrians gallop past in the distance
seated across from them are baron hugo von hoffenstein a bald hook nosed austrian aristocrat with a patrician air and cold beady eyes
he is accompanied by his attorney myron katz
liveried waiters are just clearing the table and serving coffee
we want to be reasonable here
we said we were interested in selling the pier frontage and we are interested in selling
but frankly mr
von will not be robbed
seventy five strikes us as a fair price for this parcel
were ready to conclude a deal here and now at that price
then i guess were only missing one element here
an interested party
tries to suppress a smile
waiters bring in the wine and pour a tasting portion for von hoffenstein silent coldly watchful
he rolls the wine in his glass eyes appraising julie
he takes a sip cocks his head nods
wine is poured around
katz ive found that in the real estate business three factors determine a propertys worth
katz leans forward listening
frankly you have none of the above
your fair price is fair for midtown commercial not for riverfront
its worth more to your client given his plans for the area
if my client can spin straw into gold hell still pay market price for straw
as a matter of fact business is business
deals vill come and go but ze velt vill pause for a beautiful voman
and a fine wine
our offer stands at forty eight
smiles a worldly smile
let us toast a zale at ze price of zixty millions
he starts to raise his glass preparing to toast
beneath the table to reveal julies high heel as it digs into strack srs toe to silence him
to von hoffenstein continued
youre moving in the right direction but our offer stands firm
i believe if anyone had offered you more than us youd sharing this wine with them
she sips the wine and then frowning turns to the wine steward
theres been a mistake
we ordered a bottle of beaujolais maison reme
is that not correct
beaujolais maison reme
is what i have serve
julie pleasantly but firmly corrects him
you have served us a or
pleasant but hardly worth charging
frowning examines the wine
its news to him
i serve the reme
mine tastes okay
the wine is fine
youre way out of your league here
im sure the wine steward plucks the california
the wine steward whispers sharply in french to the waiter then turns back to the table
please forgive us
we bring the bel reme
julie addresses the baron
at any rate our offer stands at forty eight
as she rises and if we cant toast we prefer not to drink
these gentlemen and i have other business to attend to so if youll excuse us
he turns to leave with her murmuring under his breath i told you to make this deal
von hoffenstein calls after them his wine glass held permit me madame
too fine a vine not to use for a toast
as julie and the stracks are leaving julie
accidentally brushes against the steward and exchanges a few words
had been watching
he approaches the steward
how much did she pay you
monsieur i dont know what you are talking about
for that little trick with the labels
he takes the stewards fist in his and unfurls the stewards fingers
revealing a hundred dollar bill
turns to julies retreating figure and smiles
filled with clear fluid
above it is another beaker filled with a brown crystalline substance
above that is an empty beaker
the fluid disappears from the bottom beaker and instantly reconstitutes in the top beaker as a steaming brown fluid
a pre measured amount flows down coiled tubing into a coffee mug a hand enters to add a dollop of half and half
he raises the mug of coffee to his lips
he looks down into his microscope
ninety eight minute
a light goes out leaving the lab in darkness except for the glow from the computer screen
is a bulb
i get a fresh
as he rummages in a drawer so did you ask her
out of habit peyton glances back to the microscope
this is unbelievable
you been saying tonight for weeks and still you dont ask her
maybe i ask to marry you
your father would never approve of me
yakitito stares at him in puzzlement
then no i ask he if gbg marry you
i peyton looks through the microscope the cells still pulsate with life
one hundred minute
peyton grips at the table with excitement
the cells are holding yakitito
okay yakitito you made your point
yakitito yakitito is out of control
westlake punch the wall
westlake punch the wall

the basketball appears in yakititos hands
you punch you answer the quesiton

trolling through the city
in the back strack sr
and strack jr
both reading financial papers
we hold on the two men for a long time
their utter stillness and silence grows unsettling
finally gold kugerands are looking attractive
another long pause
are those the ones with the chocolate centers
gold currency father as you know
and yet another pause
sounds like a frog trying to burp
strack industries will stick with real estate
you remember that
suddenly glides into a rundown texaco station
what the hell
we have a flat sir
you should be
thisll come out of your wages
the driver gets out and stoops to examine the tire
discretely removes a straight razor from his coat pocket and approaches the tire
after a pause strack sr
rises heavily to his feet
time i took a leak anyway
theres only one thing i gotta do myself and i gotta do it twenty times a day
exits the car
bends to examine the tire
is now deflated
camera moves scowls and heads ltoward taaf him r eveal coming toward him about twenty feet away walking hurriedly head bowed to the wind
who hobbles directly toward the man
camera swishes in front of strack sr
to again reveal
a one quarter view of the mans downturned face
he looks up revealing durant
a terrible malevolent grin as he lifts his newspaper
we make out the muzzle of a silencer
camera swishes to
a muffled pop as he jerks backward clutching his chest
the two men pass
glances out the window
crumbling to the ground atop a black cable
a bell sounds continuously within the service station
races out of the car and rushes over to his father
lies motionless on his stomach
turns him over revealing that strack sr
s chest is flooded in blood
revised scene numbers
as a midnight blue lincoln continental races away from the scene
lifts his father
emotion etched on every line of his face he cradles the old corpse in his arms lifting him off the black cable and the ringing sound is finally silenced
a cab pulls up in front of an industrial building
julie gets out and goes through the front door
julie ascending a flight of shadowy stairs
the steps creak as she climbs them
we hear the eerie drip drip dripping of a water pipe
she halts halfway up the stairs to listen
we hear only the scurry of cautiously
julie reaches the landing and knocks
causing the door to open with a creak
julie moves tentatively through the lab increasingly frightened sensing the presence of another person
as she starts to back towards the door she brushes against a table
something rolls and shatters on the floor
a test tube
extends from one wall to the other
reacting to the shattered test tube julie steps backward into the beam
a photic sensor picks up the disturbance
corrugated steel coverings slide down the windows blocking out all light from the laboratory
theres a whirring extrude slowly from slots over the windows
fills the room
it is a hollow voice that echos about the lab
please be seated
a spotlight snaps on illuminating a chair behind her
numbly she sits in it

a westlake yanigita presentation
a smile spreads across julies face
a slide is projected on the screen
it shows a sunset over the ocean
very corny distorted music over this shot
science is perplexed over this great mystery
shot of peyton and yakitito in white lab coats identical looks of perplexity on their faces
what are the causes of love
how do we detect its presence
what are its effects
these are some of the questions we will investigate in this lesson
again the sunset and distorted music
je origins ve
the sunset is replaced by split screen photos of peyton and julie age twelve
peyton peers into a test tube through glasses too big for his face
julie assumes a mock debonair pose for the camera
these lovers first met on a seventh grade field trip to the planetarium
shot of the night sky rich with stars and galaxies
while the narrator discussed the origins of the universe peyton held julies hand
shot of a somewhat nerdy peyton with his arm stiffly around julie
you were so slick
our test subjects were soon to use the jargon of teenagers going out
this going out period can be as short as a single date or as long as a lifetime
montage of peyton and julie throughout the years
in the case of these two a rare phenomenon it lasted twenty years
although we broke up sixteen times
sunset and distorted music
mating rumpled bed the sunset is replaced by a shot of julie on a working on legal briefs a camera faced shadow crossing the image
certain objects develop a special shared meaning to lovers
here are some objects significant to our test subjects
shot of coffee rings on a table
the coffee rings peyton tends to leave
they irritate julie and he leaves them everywhere
coffee rings on a lab report
coffee rings on a book shelf
coffee rings on a wall and ceiling
yet such minor irritations can strangely become endearing to the other mate
not just yet they havent
the slide changes to a shot of a bottle covered in wax
the bottle of dom perignon champagne julie gave peyton for his twenty first birthday
now it serves as a candle holder
i never gave you that
the champagne bottle is replaced by a shot of a record album turning on a player
the music plays over the image
finally the single love in the ark the song continues
julie smiles swept away by it
this song was playing when the two first kissed
a high school prom picture comes up on the screen
peyton in an awkwardly fitting tux and julie a blossoming beauty
in the slide they have been caught kissing
now let us leave our test subjects
the sunset again
ov in the dark theme plays over it
and eventually fades away
its fundamental nature still eludes modern science
yet researchers across the globe continue to study this ancient and powerful phenomenon
hoping one day to unlock loves mystery
credits come on
a westlake yanagita presentation
peyton the lights in the lab come on
julie turns around
steps out from behind the slide projector
pretty stupid huh
i thought it was beautiful yakitito helped
i just wanted you to see it
it was just something i wanted you to
peyton wraps his arms about her
julie moves close and they kiss
the test tubes vibrate we pan along racks of test tubes like wind chimes fall still then vibrate again

he strokes her hair
sunshine streams through the sheers of the window onto julies shoulder
she sits on the bed going over some papers her expression increasingly disturbed
julie punches a number into the phone
dale gorson please
peytons hand enters with a mug of coffee which he sets on the papers in front of her
julie takes the mug away it has indeed left a brown circle on the topmost memo
julie smiles at him
yes julie hastings
yes i found some memos researching the von hoffenstein deal that i dont think i was supposed to find
from the late mr
strack to a guy named claude bellasarious
theyre records of payments to various people on the zoning commission
peyton behind her massages her back
they look like payoffs
suspicious at the very least
well the way id like to proceed is to talk to stracks son first
give him the benefit of the doubt
under the circumstances its the least i can do
she hangs up
peyton kisses her
she leans back into his arms and closes her eyes blissfully
reluctantly she rises and slips on her shoes
peyton watches her admiring everything about her
she gracefully lays her legal papers in her briefcase and heads for the door
half way out the door she turns to peyton
revised scene is
ill call l you tonight
maybe we can get together
the sound of the closing door echos
he sits alone on the ksd looking about the empty apartment and lab beyond
in an impressive corporate power suit briefcase in hand walks briskl y down the sunny sidewalk stopping at the intersection to sig nal a cab suddenly running up behind her
dressed in jeans and sweatshirt hurries to catch up to her
she is opening the cab door when she turns to him
whats the matter
ive been thinking
maybe we should get married
freezes half in and half out of the cab door
marriage well we could do that of course theres our careers i men im just starting to get things going at the firm
and you know i kind of like having my own were practically living together now
all marriage means is you answer the phone in the and if you to pretend grandmother its a wrong number
the poor womans beginning to think she has alzheimers
i i cant talk about this now
she starts to get into the cab when peyton stops her
julie im asking you to marry me
leans out of the cab to julie
he got a ring
peyton you didnt go ou anp d you
lot of money on a ring di ring
oh no i dont have a ring
motions for julie
she leans close
he dont show much sense of commitment
bends down into frame and gives the cabbie a look that would stop a wristwatch
responds by starting the meter running
i mean i just now finally i love you peyton
she climbs into the cab closes the door
realized how much through the open but i guess im not ready
julie leans close to kiss him but the cab pulls into traffic
watches peyton grow smaller as the cab moves off
julie looks longingly back at peyton
did she make the right choice
she back once more for peyton but he is only a tiny dot in the distance
from many many stories up
we are pulling back
yes go ahead put a buy on the kugerands
thank you for your sympathy franz
he was a great man
and as long as strack industries flourishes my father lives on
the pull back shows strack behind his power desk talking nd strack into the phone
waves the person on into his lush corporatecoffice very good
he hangs up
have a seat
thank you for seeing me mr
im sorry about your father
i heard last night
my father was a great man and his loss is felt by you something
no thank you
strack ive been going over some documents and i came across something that puzzled me
its a memo from your office to a mr
claude bellasarious it went out over your fathers signature
it detailed strack has gotten up to pace
yes yes i know the memo
julie continues hesitantly it seems like the payments
were they were pay offs
to the zoning commission
bribes to call a spade a spade
he gives her an appraising look
does that shock you
in fact id surmised as much
but it disappoints you
well its hardly my place to thats right its not your place
yet i value your good opinion
surely you dont expect me to endorse it
im sure my father never intended for you to know about it
im sorry if hes compromised you in any way
but i am asking you to understand
im not going to bore you with that old speech about how we all have to swim in the same pond
but you know as well as i that
not so much as one mini mall ever went up in this city without some grease being laid into the palms downtown
youre not naive you know its a cost of doing business
ordinarily you dont have to face it
well i face it and a lot worse into acynic thats the easy way out and im tougher than that
strack gestures towards a table top architectural model of the riverfront development
take a look at that model julie
that was my fathers dream
now its my dream
acres of riverfront reclaimed from decay thousands of jobs created a building block a very large building block laid for the future
not such a bad dream as dreams go
and if the price of realizing that dream is the occasional distasteful chore well
the point is my father is well beyond the reach of the law but that memo could embarrass strack enterprises
all right youre point is well taken
but the fact remains that im in possession of evidence of the commission of a crime
you can no more ask me to destroy it than i could ask you to destroy one of your buildings
let me suggest this
you excuse yourself for a few minutes go to the ladies room leaving your briefcase here
what happens to the memorandum while its in my custody is my responsibility
i wish it were that simple
first of all i dont have the memo with me
even if i did it isnt safe to have that document
are you threatening me
moves closer touching her arm
im trying to protect you
he hesitates pursing st her
his lips wondering if he can tru does the name robert durant mean anything to you
hes an underworld figure racketeering drugs
and real estate
robert durant is competitor for the river front and knows about that document
he is a criminal julie
and he will freelyat resort to criminal methods to get he wants
theres a pause
well youre very eloquent frankly im not certain what i should do
youll have to trust me for a day or so to figure this out
is that the most i can extract from you
i believe it is
well then my dear im in your hands
julie exits the office area and gets into an elevator
descend in the elevator
music is piped in from overhead speakers
it takes a moment before julie realizes what shes the song im ir e dare haunting
as julie listens she becomes more and more affected
and you know he never said one bad word to that girl
he never done wrong by her
shes sure sorry now
he was a rare one
well you find someone who loves you like jim loved her you shouldnt give em up so easy
the womens remarks are not lost
peyton stands over the projected microscope image on the computer monitor
ninety six minute
so did you ask her
not yet yakitito not yet
this is unbelievable
every day time yakitito
it still ninety six minute
sounds to me that maybe you didnt ask her
maybe your afraid
look i asked her
she said no okay
well she actually said i dont know
peyton stands and stretches
the telephone rings peyton moves to answer it
ill get it
is beaming as she stands at a pay phone waiting for peyton to answer
please be there peyton
reaches for the phone when
juts out of the shadows and clutches at peytons wrist
we hold on his shocked face as the phone rings and then stops
a light hits peytons face
he turns to look
paulys chunky outline flashes on in the back of the lab
the middle aged balding man raiseshasboitleare of maalox to his lips
hiteafluid coated with the chalky w comes on revealing trumayne
reveals the entire gang corky corcoran and a grinning smiley stand side by side
near them skip
in the very back is rick looking a little green around the gills
revused scene is
looks wildly about
panning from skip to rudy to trumayne to paulys fist being launched directly into the camera
is knocked back across the lab table
glassware and equipment fly
pulls him up and slams him into the wall
sags down then hauls himself to his knees to behold snip
trimming the end of a cigar which is then brought to the mouth of
no foolish heroics if you please
we have come only for documentstell us where to find the bellasarious memorandum and we shall disappear like a nightmare before the breaking day
i dont know what youre talking
bam bam pauly has grabbed him by the hair and rams his head into the wall twice
looking sadly down
the bellasaurious memorandum if you please
i told you i dont know what youre talking about
crackle yakatito yanagita is thrust into frame his mouth stretched wide under the plastic bag that covers his head
should your houseboys predicament not jog your memory you may bid him godspeed
let him breathe
you heard the doctor ventilate him
rick steps forward unholstering a gun
pointing it at the spot where yakatitos mouth gapes under the plastic
surges forward but a vicious backhand blow from pauly sends him back to the floor
he raises his face just as bam an orange flash plays on peytons horrified features
yakatito drops into frame in front of him
revised scene is
with a trembling hand he holsters the gun
he withdraws a bottle of pills from his jacket
he shakes out two and swallows them dry
emerges from the bedroom
he waves the coffee stained document that he has found
grab peyton and ram him into the two electrodes that lead to a reservoir of blue fluid
s connects and is electrified
unable to lot go he shrieks a s his body his skin peels away from the bone under the intense electrical charge
omit peyton opens his mouth but no sounds come out
twitches in horror
he screams as his hands burst into flame
the electrodes that he clutches snap and fall into the reservoir of blue fluid which instantly crackles revised scene s
o flashes of white current light up smileys beaming face
collapses to the floor atop his flaming hands smothering them
calmly puts out his cigar and opens the valve on a green tank labeled oxygen
then another acetylene
he places his electronic lighter under the beak of the drinking bird
like an oil rig the birds beak bobs closer and closer to the switch on the lighter
pulls himself to his knees cradling the smoking claws that were his hands
durant lifts him to his feet
please remain calm
lets keep this orderly
resistance now would only prompt acts of pointless cruelty
durant gestures with a quick movement with his head
grab firmly ahold of peytons legs
they rush him forward and dunk his head into the electrified bath of blue fluid
face upside down eyes bulging
underwater electrical sparks course past him
scream bubbles erupt from his mouth
the charged blue fluid eats into his skin
grins with delight
the scream subsides as the electricity short circuits and shuts down
peytons limp body falls out of frame
surveys the wrecked lab then hands trumayne his cigar trimmer
softly bring the asians fingers
aloud to his gentlemen
hiss filling the room with the explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene
beak inches closer to the ignition button on the lighter
stirs slightly his breath a twisted wheeze
slowly he comes to his knees
head and hands trailing smoke he crawls toward the bobbing bird and lighter
revised scene is
a midnight blue continental pulls away
a cab pulls up
julie emerges from the cab and fishes in her purse for the fare
the headlights of the limo sweep over her and away
drags himself past the bay windows to within a foot of the bobbing bird
the hissing of the gas is loud
dips closer to the electronic lighters ignition button
crawls to the base of the table which holds the bobbing bird and lighter
fumbles for the lighter
the lighter clicks
e close shot slow motion frames a second
a tiny spark is born
revised scene s
widens in fear then contracts responding to a bright silent flash
one thousand lab sheets ignite
on the screen flash the slides from the peyton yakitito presentation
images of peyton and julie
the split screen picture of the two lovers melts as the screen directly between us and the blast
an intense blue light fades up brilliantly backlighting peyton
his stark shadow burns into us
as he is thrust off of his feet and rocketed through the wall
intense blue light flashes out of the windows and up the chimney into the sky
a peytons rag doll body spins end over end upward towards the stars
b it takes a moment for the sound of the explosion to catch up with the blast kaaaboooommmm
noise that makes the earth shake
revised scene s
is knocked to the sidewalk by the shock wave
a flaming chair and large bricks rain down around her
peytons flaming body plummets toward the earth like a comet
peyton splashes to the fire lit water
he floats like a dead man flaming debris from the building splashing down around him
with a groan he sinks beneath the murky water
julie pulls herself to her feet
she stands in utter shock in a downpour of forks knives and spoons
lke a hay stack
offscreen sirens wail
she stands in shock as
float past her and the burning building beyond
night turns to day as tombstones appear on either side of her
the falling bits of paper change to falling leaves
revised scene ss
a falling bits of paper super against black slow motion a change to falling leaves
she remains in the exact same position
her business suit becomes a black suit of mourning
her expression of shock has not changed
in front or her a marker
it reads peyton westlake
camera pulls leans against his limousine looking bored
he turns to the gravedigger an older man dressed in soiled work overalls who props himself up on his shovel
didnt see you workin out there
never found the guys body just an ear
dont take long to bury that
now sometimes when this happens folks
be lookin for a discount
but see it aint the diggin that your payin for its the real estate
they watch as
buttons her coat and straightens herself attempting to gain resolve
she will put this behind her
she walks toward the limousine but is suddenly hammered by grief
her gait wavers
racked by sobbing she falls
tears stream from her eyes as she clutches at the grass
helps her to her feet
raises her tear soaked face and we see the extent of her suffering
the tiny figure of the priest as he places a consoling arm around her
they walk off to the waiting car
the undifferentiated blue resolves itself as a ripplin blue fluid resembling the acid bath in peytons lab
a form emerges from its depths a completely bandaged head breaks the surface of the fluid
a patient is lifted from a hydro tank the complex water vessel in which burn patients are treated
he lies perfectly still hands and face swathed in gauze a th century mummy
tubes and wires
poke from his body
we hear the steady beeping of a cardiogram
carefully strap the mummy onto a hydraulically powered multi axied burn platform
behind him are other bandaged patients some rotating on burn platforms some still submerged in their hydro tanks
saunter over to the hydraulic bed where nurses adjust the patients i
here we have a year old male no i
no medical history
fished the guy out of the river with burns covering over forty percent of his body
his hands and
face were the most severe
pushes a button
motors grinding the hydraulic platform rotates slowly spinning the mummified man
for a brief moment he is upside down
ten years ago pain from the burns would have been intolerable
the guy would have spent the rest of his screaming
now we use the rangeveritz technique quite simply we sever his spino thalamic nerve
he extends a telescoping steel pointer and to ns bandaged ear
indicates a spot just above pey here
which as you know transmits neural impulses of pain and vibratory sense to the brain
he collapses the pointer and returns it to his pocket
continues its slow rotation with the mummified patient now turned sideways
no longer receiving impulses of pain you stick him with a pin
he jabs a sterilized needle deep into the bandaged knee
the resident leaves the pin in the knee for dramatic effect
and he cant even feel it
with a sharp practiced motion he plucks out the pin
his eyes still closed
of course there are serious emotional side effects to this operation
when the body ceases to feel when so much sensory input is lost the patient becomes alienated
the mind cut off from its regular diet of input has a never satisfied thirst alienation gives rise to loneliness anger uncontrolled rage is not uncommon
and the rage problem is exacerbated by the chemical effect of severing the nerve
now surges of adrenaline flow unchecked through body and brain giving him the strength of dozen men
hence the leather restraints
the resident turns and heads for the door
the interns follow behind like ducklings
but as it rotates into frame and clangs to a halt
between the bandages the eyes pop open blue and fiercely lucid
he has heard everything
the resident speaks over his shoulder to the interns as they walk
naturally we give him every chance of recovery
he waves his hands about in futile circles letting the interns know that this is the party line
talk to him about rehabilitation potential
i give him a nine on the buzzard scale
emit a loud warning tone

freeze for a half moment turn and race back the way they came
as they race pell mell down the hallway rubbing conductive jelly between the defibrilator paddles

her jaw drops in disbelief
doctors and technicians rush into the room and freeze

he cant see above the heads of the technicians and interns

he pushes his way to the front of the crowd and blinks stupidly at the camera
loose bandages torn leather restraints and tangled e
wires dangle aimlessly in the wind a bright flash of lightning illuminates the empty hydraulic bed
is suddenly blown back by a gust of wind
confused he looks up from the bed and out the open window
dark storm clouds billow over the city
thunder rumbles and it begins to rain
a delirious peyton now wearing a ratty black overcoat staggers and falls into an oily mud puddle
he slowly raises his bandaged face from the mud
desperate eyes peer out from a slit in the muddied bandages
he forces himself to stand and move onward
he stops in his tracks
julie steps from the stylish foyer and opens her umbrella
he staggers across the street after her
terrified at the sight of
clutching at her shoulder
scarred tendons and hand bones poke from unraveling bandages
they grip tighter seeking help
repulsed julie spins to see
a vague unrecognizable shape in the shadows
from it comes the awful sound of an inhuman voice an unintelligible guttural rasp juuuuulieeeeee
a gasp caught in her throat backs away
removes his offending recoils from her behind his back
horror hand andtuck eitlshamefully its meeeeeee
moves quickly away her hand protecting her throat
her fear is mixed with pity as she turns away from this monstrous man

it snags on a stick revealing the pictures headline scientist dies in accidental blast body still missing
lying in the alley staring at the whirlpool
the charred door falls toward us and into the ashes of peytons lab apartment
stands in the doorway wearing the black tattered overcoat and bandages
he gapes at the wreckage of his former world

the bandleader wraps up the song
reveals the beaming face of governor bryant a red faced man in his late forties
he sits at the head of a crowded table
a huge cake elaborately constructed in the sleek shape of a sleek modern skyline
the same as the model on stracks desk
cuts one of the skyscrapers neatly in half with the knife
the governor passes the piece to louis strack jr
who sits at his side
as usual louis you get the first piece of the action
strack takes a bite from the buildings top floors
louis i want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude my extreme gratitude to the crowd hes talking about my campaign loud laughter
the governor waves it away
im talking about the riverside development program
louis youve breathed new life into a neighborhood long ago lost to the democrats
the band is faintly heard
julie stands before the mirror and practices a convincing smile
beside her a young woman pouts to the mirror as she applies lipstick
the woman exits through the tiled archway
her shadow meets that of a mans
julie watches the happy shadows embrace kiss and move off
she stands immobilized overcome
a beautiful woman floats down a set of marble stairs
wearing a tight fitting formal black dress
she forces a smile
she looks unhappy but she looks good
she sits at a bar a little away from the party area
vodka and lime please
a business man flushed with drink observes her
he moves to the seat beside her
drowning your sorrows eh
just giving them something to swim around in
she drinks the vodka quickly
why don ya tell all your troubles to old jimbo
please remove your hand
the businessman has his hand on her thigh it crawls upward
clamps firmly down on his shoulder and spins him around
hey what the stands before him
distinguished and dapper looking better than ever
he gives his famous grin
its worth a million dollars
ferguson youve had too much to drink
right away mr
chastened he beats a hasty retreat
strack turns to julie
thanks for getting rid of that guy
thank you for coming
im glad youre here
he takes her by the arm and starts to lead her across the crowded floor
i havent wanted to bother you during your period of grief but i have to know whether youve come to a decision regarding the belasarius memorandum
the decisions been made for both of us
the papers were destroyed in the fire
i want to forget all about that the fire the whole thing
im quite disturbed by it
i cant help but wonder
do you remember when i mentioned a certain competitor of mine robert g
ive considered it
but the police ruled out arson
it burned hot
a gas fire
there was an acetylene leak the tiniest spark she breaks off getting choked up
stracks manner is sympathetic and solemn
believe me i am no stranger to the frustration and anguish that comes from the loss of a loved one
he forces himself to rally his spirits
my dear theres no cure for grief he takes her by the hand
but there is something that eases the symptoms
he sweeps her out onto the dance floor
julie i was quite impressed with yo performance in the von hoffenstein negotiations
i believe in instinct
i like yours
i want you to think about something
no need to decide now
but id like staff
you as a member of my permanent thats very flattering my commitments to pappas ive already spoken to ed pappas
you had no right dont be childish i had every right
he doesnt want to lose you said hell fight tooth and nail to keep you at the firm

just consider that i wont be outbid

i know you hastings
yoyoure why ready for something g we understand each other
takes her arm because we both worked for it
we both sweated for it
he increases his grip and lowers his voice taking her into his confidence
we both know what its like to bethe o the bottom
well now im o ridt ut
top and i m offering you
resents being gripped and lectured to and yet
she senses in strack a power and magnetism that holds her
ill consider it
as he sweeps her around her eye catches something
her face tightens
strack i dont want to alarm you but who is that man speaking with the governor
turns to look
whats bg doing here
swish pan from stracks frozen expression
through a blur of dancers to chatting with the governor
he catches stracks eye
holds eye contact for a moment

in the shadowy lot

he fishes about in his breast pocket and removes a bottle of prescription pills

then lets out an julies eyes open
she reels back
bolting up from sleep sweating though his facial bandages
the vein in his temple throbbing eyes livid as a beasts
professional hands busily performing the process of durant cradling a taxidermy
camera pans up to
telephone to his shoulder talking as he works
he grasps a offscreen object with the tweezers andit removes it from the formaldehyde solution
he pats dry with a white cloth
get rudy on the phone
just shut up and listen
you get a little gift from chinatown today
well that coney that pauly took is really stingin my ass
we do it my way
you tell hung fat that im coming by tomorrow to make the pick up personally
either he coughs green or he becomes part of my collection
he places the object in a box lined with red velvet
he takes a long admiring look
we get only a glimpse
and arranged in neat littl e rows professionally preserved box h he closes the cover s someestill wi a shadowy form lurks by a telephone pole by the front of
an electronic bug attached to one of the terminals gives off a flashing red light
a wire from the bug leads to
its microcassette spins
filtered through it we hear durants phone conversation continue
it would be a nice addition
jew want me to be at your place
that would be just fine for me
we are tracking off the cassette up a long cord that leads to a pair of headsets worn by darkman
his eyes glisten through the slits of his bandages
a set of hands enter frame and crack him viciously across the head
he sprawls backward caught off guard
is shoved against his bandaged throat
hey shithead give up the radio
and the money
like lightening a skeletal claw lashes out
snaps closed upon mugger s wrist
the pincer twists sharply and we hear the awful crack of the muggers wrist shattering
gleam like a shark as it bites
screams dropping the switchblade to the pavement
turns to mugger as he pulls down the bandages from around his mouth revealing a terrible maw of black and crooked teeth attached to a lipless jawbone
and words come out run for your life
flee in fear
contorts his face into a ghastly interpretation of a smile and slips back into the shadows
sit at a table drinking coffee and sharing a slice of pie
but why do you have to stay at this burn center
you can stay at my place now
closes around peytons real skin on synthetic skin
no its best for now till all the kinks have been smoothed out
peyton glances at his watch
peyton i still dont understand
why didnt you come back to see me before now
its like i told you
the burns left some scars and
i was ashamed
i was afraid that you wouldnt want me anymore
of course i still want you
what if i was
so horribly burned that you couldnt stand to look at me
couldnt stand to have me touch you
if that were the case
i dont know
but why even ask me that
the point is youre fine
just like always
peyton is filled with the warmth of being accepted and wanted once again
i am back arent i
just like always
we pan past the lab table cluttered with empty pizza boxes and a tangled mass of used bandages
from offscreen we hear durants recorded voice that would be just fine for me
we hear the garbled chatter of the audio tape being rewound
we are panning past the walkman which is wired to the computer
the tape stops then as programmed plays again
that would be just fine for me
we pan past the back of the darkmans head
the bandages have been removed
although his face is not visible the singed hairless back of his skull is
it is not a pretty sight
the darkman swabs a thick white paste silvidine burn ointment upon his skeletal fingers
that would be just fine for me
the darkman switches off the desk lamp and removes a mask from a black lightproof bag
he examines it returns the mask to the bag then slips it into his coat
the camera arcs around to see the bottom half of his skeletal face
that would be
click the darkman stops the tape mid sentence and his own hideously charred mandible finishes it just fine for me
f revised scene is
the impression is good though slightly thick
the darkman strokes his jawbone thoughtfully
we are looking at a convenience store from the high angle of a video camera
the harshly lit store has aisles of cheese whiz twinkies shampoos and various other things not found in nature
a digital readout at the bottom of the screen blinks her sets them on the counte before the lone erk
wanna bag for that
that would be just fine for me
the clerk bags the pizzas as durant pulls out a revolver from his suit coat
the clerk takes a fearful step back
hey hey take it easy buddy
name aint buddy
he waits for the video security camera to pan to him and stop
he cheats in toward the lens for a good clear close up that fills the screen
durant matching the previous shot except that it is in color
he is speaking to someone just off camera
m robert g
the camera is pulling back to reveal that he is standing in the open doorway of his home facing cops
he glances at his watch
but im in a hurry
got a meeting at nine
youre gonna be late
as cop slaps a pair of cuffs ondurant
trumayne is driving
we pan from him to rudy to
snipping a cigar
we follow it up to the mouth of robert g
his temple pulsates faintly
a large sign above the entrance reads the mandarin
the continental pulls up to the curb
trumayne waits in the car as guzman and darkman durant step out into the bright morning sunshine
hesitates calculating the intensity of the sunlight
he sneaks a glance at his watch
it reads minutes
revised scene is
followsaluzman into the restaurant
the real durant moves angrily down the steps
his mouthpiece marvin katz accompanies him
had it all on film
i almost didnt get em to post bail
just keep em out of my hair
hey where you going
jumps into a waiting taxi cab and bellows at the mandarin
the cab peels out
hung fat dressed in a finely tailored white linen suit and smoking a long brown cigarette smiles in greeting
so good of you to favor me with your venerated presence
please honor me by seating yourself in my shabby chair
darkman durant remains impassively standing
or do me the greater honor of remaining on your feet
how i tremble with shame
how i hide my face
he elaborately does so with his hands
studies durant darkman with uncertainty
after another beat of uncomfortable silence he decides to begin for his boss
we no here for de bullshit we here to pick up de money and thas what we do
glances up at the harsh fluorescent light
he runs a
hand across the artificial fleshof his face checking for signs of decomposition
he sneaks a look to his
how i regret having to burden you with my miserable difficulties
i have no money
the darkmans eyes shift
he was not expecting this
hung fat is waiting for an explosion
there is none
sensing an advantage he presses on
the white powder no longer flows in iis former volume
all a members of in poverty
studies the darkman hard
how can he tolerate this
and of all your unworthy servants hung fat is the most destitute
as if in response to some silent signal four enormous and muscular chinese men enter and stand arms crossed in a threatening posture
even hung fats own minable slaves sometimes ignore his wishes and attack those people whom hung fat cherishes most deeply
wahbuht they know nothing of our golden friendship
is looking from hung fat to durant darkman whats wrong
why doesnt he do something
so until that shining day may it soon come
when i shall once again be able to honor you with bounty i bid you goodbye
good bye wahbuht
he is shaking his hand pressing his advantage invading his physical space and making mockery of him
cant believe his eyes
letting hung fat pump his hand like an idiot
hung fat drops his hand
it dangles lamely at his side
the darkman walks over to a bamboo chair and slumps
closes his eyes and sighs
he removes a cigar from his breast pocket
with his eyes closed you will bring me the five million dollars by the time i finish this cigar
hung fat flinches at what he sees
the camera pans to the sound
the cigar to a third of its the darkman has just snippe d and puffs
he lights his mocking smile disappears as he sees
it fills the bottom of the frame
above filling the top half of the frame the darkmans evil eyes through the rippling heat of the cigar
their intensity pierces the shroud of smoke and burns holes into hung fats soul
without a trace of an accent okay bob you win
durant fps from his taxi stalled in morning traffic
he pushew his way roughly through the crowd toward hung fats mandarin cuisine at the end of the block
is extinguished in an ashtray as a briefcase is set down alongside it
placed there by who takes a step back alongside hung fat
grabs the case
as he exits the office with guzman he sneaks a look at it reads minutes
ant dart an and guzman head for the revolving doors
a tiny skin blister has bubbled up on his light sensitive facial mask
his hand comes up to smooth it out
approaches quickly pointing at durant darkmans face
he reaches into a pocket pulls out
durants monogrammed lighter which he hands to durant darkman
as he runs up to trumayne and smiley who are waiting in the continetal
where is he
i thought he was with you
sprints for the restaurant
clutching the briefcase as he follows guzman through the revolving doors
guzman exits onto the street
but as durant darkman revolves through the door he slams suddenly to a halt
in the next chamber of the revolving door he sees
whose disbelieving face moves closer to get a better look
dressed identically stare at each other through the glass in eerie confrontation
stands upon the sidewalk gaping in wonder
aye que papa
shoves the door forward dislodging the stunned real durant
he rotates past guzman and points to the real durant revolving behind him
draws his gun and waits sweating
spins past the incredulous him to the durant shoot him
real durant points the revolving doors whirl faster
round he goes
nods recalibrates his orders and stands ready to fire
spins past him
doesnt know who to plug
leaps out onto the street
leaps out onto the street
they face each other
its impossible to tell
only the briefcase of cash distinguishes one from the other
go directly for each others throats
the briefcase falls to the ground
they call to guzman
real durants face is spun out of frame and replaced with durant darkmans exact replica
waves his gun back and forth from one durant to the other
revised scene s
slams durants face against the brick wall of the restaurant
one durant falls to the pavement clutching his head groggy
raises an uncertain gun to the standing durant
backhands guzman viciously across the face crack
son of a bitch set me up with the cops and you practically hand him the cash
watches warily as standing durant picks up the briefcase
what the hell you lookinat
shoot retrains his gun on the fallen durant who covers his face
but before he fires he gives a final glance to standing durant
the sunward side of his face is bubbling and blistering revealing glimpses of a skull beneath
what are you deaf
he notes a wisp of smoke and knows the jig is up
he slams the briefcase into guzmans face thwack
knocking him to the ground
the darkman sprints down the sidewalk through the crowd
climbs to his feet holding his bleeding head
he backhands guzman across the face crack
he grabs guzmans gun and runs after his alter ego
woozily pulls a snub nosed
from his ankle holster and gamely follows
races down the street leaving a thin trail of yellow smoke
he halts at a busy intersection
cars speed past
no way to cross
he turns to the sound of gunshots
gun in hand and closing fast
a cart filed with crates is wheeled directly in his path
real durant gracefully leaps atop the crates and never letting up his rain of fire springs from them
while in free fall he ejects the spent cartridge and snaps in a fresh clip
in a shower hear the frightened scatter
is in the process of cellular fragmentation
his mask emits tiny jets of blue flame
he runs for a subway entrance
they are gun follow after the th em fire e at nce
toting t umayne
dalll three of o darkman takes a bullet in the arm
although he cant h feel it the knocks away bloody
his wound he touches his smoking face reveals no pain only puzzlement
he vaults over the turnstile and races down the platform
note the blood as they reload
they ju p the turnstile with guns drawn and look about for the darkman
durant spots something lying on the platform
he picks it up
is slims and translucent
durant holds it to the light
its the mask of his own face
it smolders and melts
he f ligs it away
sticks to the tiled wall of the subway next to guzman and trumayne
durants nose and cheeks melt together into a sickening goo
step back sickened
me cago en dios i can no believe dis shit
notes drops of blood which lead off the platform and down into the dark subway tunnel
we aint going in dere are we
durant pulls a tiny penlight from his pocket and leaps from the platform onto the track bed
dark dank spooky
durant carries the penlight
guzman and trumayne follow reluctantly
goddamn it man
we follow some pendejo without a face
into a goddamn hole in de ground
holds up his hand commanding silence as they come to an intersection of subway tunnels
both lead into darkness
they listen but all is quiet
they speak in hushed tones
you go that way
well take this one
doesnt look too thrilled by the prospect of being alone in the tunnels
take a fucking squad of marines with you
tosses him the penlight
casually he lights a cigar and continues forward
watches durant and guzman disappear down the tunnel
the sound of their footsteps recedes
trumaynes breathing is shallow
he loosens his necktie and unbuttons his collar
he takes a breath
he advances silently through the tunnel
he points the penlight in the direction of the clanging sound
an empty wine bottle at his feet is illuminated
rolls to a stop against the tunnel wall
a faint cough comes from the blackness ahead
raises the penlight
cannot pierce he darkness
trumayne bends down and picks up the bottle keeping his fearful eyes on the darkness ahead
the cough again
heaves the bottle at the sound
as it tumbles end over end into the darkness
waitsr the crash ready to fire at anything that moves
still waiting nerves on edge
wheres the crash
the oppressive dark
shudders something in the darkness has swallowed the bottle
he begins to back out of the tunnel the way he came
he freezes in the center of a tunnel intersection at the sound of footsteps
crunching on gravel approaching
he fingers the guns trigger
empty tunnels on all sides
the footsteps quicken
panicked trumayne shines his light in front of him
the footsteps come faster closer
he jerks his penlight to the tunnel behind him
revised scene s
to his right
to his left
hes trying to see all the tunnels at once
he spins desperately firing into each of them
spits flame blam
is illuminated by the brilliant flash of the gun
the light fades
spins and fires boom
are lit up
crazed with fear
the illumination fades
spins and spits sparks beam
the light fades
p tunnel melting the split second flash has caught him pouncing in mid air
for the first time we see the complete nightmare
only the uppw right quarter of peytons face remains intact
but as for the rest
the i a is a hairless skull covered with random bits of scaranf char
without the benefit of gums or lips the entire ength of his teeth are exposed down to the root connec g crookedly to the jaw bone
one ear remains intact the other a burnt hole
only the rudimentary cartile forms the nose
but it is the wild eyeballs protruig obscenely from the bone of their sockets that tell tba story
there lies madness a dark river of evil rage
they hear trumaynes throaty scream then silence
they run toird the sound
when they arrive they see only the penlight laying upon the track bed
its dull glow shines upon the wet walls of the tunnels
nearby they find the gun and one of trumaynes shoes
look like saucers
even looks a little scared
oh shit man
what did he do man
from the tunnel ahead footsteps approach
the two men squint attempting to pierce the blackness
the footsteps grow louder
hey amigo dat chew
from the darkness a figure emerges and runs at them
raise their rods and blast the dark figure lurches and collapses upon the ties
a shaft of light reveals it to be
gagged with his hands tied behind his back a wild look of terror in his dead eyes
gape stupidly at the body before them
they glance fearfully to one another through the fog of gunsmoke
looks about gets control loads a fresh clip into his gun with an echoing snap
waves his arms in surrender
im outta here
durant grabs him
where the hell are you going
revised scene waters
durant looks wildly over his shoulder as he runs for his life
two thousand tons of unforgiving steel is barreling down upon his
one hundred feet away and closing
thirty feet ten
roar atop the track
durants feet slower moving enter view just ahead
lit by the flying blue sparks it emits an evil laugh
tunnel walls zip past in the background
he runs the train gigantic behind him
durants face is stretched in panic
the cigar is still in his mouth between clenched teeth
he fixes on something ahead
in the middle of the track a shallow depression
running only a shoes length ahead of the sparking wheel
as he desperately leaps for the depression in the tracks
he appears to go down right under the train
hugging the shallow depression
is he low enough
the underside of the train comes roaring over us
the train begins its long roar past
we hear an agonized scream that is either the train or durant or some ungodly combination
is illuminated with a flash of light
from the light pouring out the passing train windows
throw blue sparks into the darkness
the long subway train rolls into the distance
its rumble fades
durants cigar smoulders on the tracks
rises quietly into frame
his suit is still clean
he appears remarkably unscathed
he runs a hand through his hair turns and walks slowly along the tracks
thats when we see his back the train has raked off the fabric of his suit and pants exposing bare back and buttocks
somehow maintaining his dignity durant picks up the smouldering cigar from the tracks
he takes a puff and moves off
darkman sits with the phone faintly ringing against his ear
something frantic about him the vein in his fore head faintly beating
while he waits for the other party to answer he cuts into the painless wound on his arm with a surgical instrument digging for something finally julies voice comes on
we cut from darkmans ravaged monster face to beautiful as ever
where have you been
why havent you called
back to the monster face can i can i see you
the bullet is dislodged from the wound and drops on the table
various close shots of screaming patrons on the tilt a a whirl their faces hideously distorted by wind centrifugal force and their mouths stretched wide to scream
various close shots of leering horses bobbing up and down
we are at a carnival
laughing his face restored walking down the midway one arm draped over julies shoulder
she laughs with him
peyton glances at his watch
put away that watch or ill think you dont like me anymore
oh peyton lets spend the whole day together the whole week
ive got to tell you julie
ive got to tell you something about about me how ive changed
in the fire i i a voice offscreen rises above the general noise see the mutant man half man half beast
witness this prodigy of science with your own eyes
peyton whirls around
soliciting pedestrians to a side show
whats going on peyton
what are you keeping from me
peyton ares at julie
he cant bring himself to tell her
cmon im going to win you the biggest fuzziest pinkiest animal doll on that rack
something youll be truly embarrassed to own
and then ive got to run
they have stopped in front of a booth where softballs get tossed at bottle pyramids
peyton lays down a dollar and is handed three balls
why do you always have to run
peyton looks at the pyramid avoiding her look
he throws the first ball misses
have my treatment
im not a hundred percent cured yet but i soon will be
he throws the second ball misses
can i take you back to the burn center
peytons vein begins to throb faintly
i dont want you to see me there
i dont want you to think of me as
an invalid or
some kind of f ff fff freak
on that word he throws the last ball with great force
the pyramid explodes
peyton breathing heavily takes a moment to collect himself then says quietly to the booth attendant
the pink elephant please
the bored attendant a cigarette dangling from his lower lip shakes his head
it dont count if you aint standing behind that line
i was behind the line
i was standing right here
next to my girlfriend
the pink elephant if you please
julie tugs at his sleeve
peyton it doesnt matter
peyton is fighting to contain his rage
in clipped words between gasps for breath it matters
i won a pink elephant
for my girlfriend
get lost buddy
people screaming on the tilt a whirl
merry go round horses bobbing up and down
calliope music gets louder and louder
shaking under the pressure of contained rage his vein bulging throbbing
under his breath the elephant
the attendant unwisely pushes two fingers into peytons chest
we rocket into a close shot of the offending digits
from of fscreen we hear the attendants voice you heard me weirdo
the counter dissolves into a million fissures as do the stuffed animals on the shelves above
twitching violently vein swollen to bursting
the camera races into an eyeball to find screaming
a skin blister bubbles on his cheek
against peytons chest
peyton grabs them and crack breaks them
the attendant screams
peyton screams with him
julie screams as well
peyton reaches for the attendant lifts him into the air hurls him into another pyramid which collapses
is yanked violently from the shelf
shoves it at julie
in a voice hoarse with rage take it
another skin blister opens
his face is starting to send off wisps of smoke
she is looking at him frozen in horror
his face is erupting into boils which simmer and pop giving off bursts of smoke
peyton stares at her
his eyes become haunted
hoarsely forgive me
he runs off the fuzzy pink elephant still clasped forgotten beneath one arm
julie runs after him
disappears around a corner trailing thin wisps of smoke
darkman rushes down the darkened alley unlocks the warehouse door and rushes inside
camera pans to who has seen it all from the shadows
theres a horrible ripping noise
darkman is destroying something flailing his arms
roll toward the noise
he steps back into the shadows
julie slips through a warehouse window
she is confronted by rack upon rack of clothing shoes body padding and wigs
the place looks like the wardrobe room of a major studio
she cautiously advances
her eyes fall upon something that makes her gasp
ripped to shreds its white stuffing all over the place
he moves forward towards a darkened corner of the lab
i need to talk to you
she halts at a site in front of her
beams of light cut through the darkness to reveal it the charred holographic imagers computers and the rebuilt bio press all sit atop large wooden crates
beyond two lab tables made chains
oldoors them hang suspended from the ceiling by tubes and beakers of liquid skin
in the place of i the bge af rdpmustangcserveseas salvaged bucketeseathofean o the lab chair
eats from a discarded pizza box
despite its eerie nature the layout and feel of the lab is hauntingly familiar
backs away frightened right into
hanging from a hook
her hand trembles as she lifts the eyeless face into frame
she forces herself to examine it closely
her the revulsion gives way to pity
she brings it into beam of light
revised scene ambers accomparaed by the sound of buzzing flies and sizzling skin blisters boil furiously
she drops it she steadies herself against the computer table there are tears in her eyes
trembling she turns to face the darkness
presses bimself into the shadows
turns his head sharply
only the upper right corner of his face falls into the light
the handsome undamaged portion
why didnt you tell me
if you loved me why didnt you tell me
shamed to be both coward and monster clutches his bony hand to his skull
you had no right tears stream down julies face but she is too upset to brush them away
she moves forward
she angrily shoves the computer off the table
it crashes to the ground sparking
do you think it was the face i cared about
is that how little you think of me
why didnt you come to me
he is shaken by a silent sob
more of his face falls into light illuminating leathery neck muscles and hideous bone
julie looks about the dark and desolate warehouse
the sight of the bandages
the liquid skin
the charred peyton julie photograph
her face softens
she feels the darkmans pain
i would have helped you
she stares into the shadows a long time without speaking
dont you know i love you peyton
and no matter what no matter what youve become ill always love you
his eyes expressing a ray of hope he didnt think possible until now
we hear the sound of too quietly to julie
then louder in julie
but juba is gone
strackaz naked except for a monogrammed bath towel wrapd around his thickening midriff walks across the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment
a mahler symphony plays in the background
he bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that rests on a marble stand then grunting under the strain of the load he staggers back across the room to
the king sized bed
with a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest out onto the bed
a torrent of golden icrugerands
they wash over the bed so many that some spill over the sides and clatter to the floor
strack pauses for a beat staring down at the booty then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the floor
like a swan he dives
he rolls luxuriating in the feel of gold against flesh laughter bubbling from his lips
gold coins stick to his flushed sweating flesh then slough off leaving their imprint
strack makes swimming motions with his arms laving himself with the golden coins a knock at the door
julie hastings to see you mr
strack eyes dart nervously to the door
he clears his very well
a coin or two falls from his dimpled ass as he reaches down for his pants
strack enters tying his tie
julie how sweet of you to come before our appointed hour
but i expected you in something a little more formal
didnt ruth inform you that we have tickets to der fliedermause tonight
i cant go louis
we have to talk
i love to talk
thank you no
ill have one as he walks to a bar and pours himself a drink
fair warning its napoleon and its quite good louis i cant see you anymore
darling settle down
dont be rash
as you say lets talk
you know about peyton the man i was louis hes alive
he was burned horribly horribly burned i dont understand what happened but i know he needs my help
strack is visibly taken aback
he sets the brandy down
your news has a bittersweet flavor
of course im very happy for you
if theres anything i can do the finest medical care can be at your disposal burn therapy recon structive surgery
how badly was he
julie has broken down
she sits down on stracks sofa her body wracked with sobs
where is he julie
hes living in an abandoned warehouse
he needs me
the phone rings
strack crosses to the desk and picks it up
all right ill take it in the other room
he looks up at julie
i wont be a moment
he walks into an adjoining room
he picks up the phone
and the closing price
she reaches for a tissue
next to it is
stracks briefcase sitting on top of his desk
wipes a tear from her eyes
she moves closer
i feel sufficiently diversified
franz it is immaterial to me what the market is doing
i want you to buy
a sheaf of papers stick up above the mouth of the briefcase
a dark coffee stain
as she pulls the papers from the briefcase
yes you did hear me correctly
i want you to buy
ten thousand krugerands
the belasarious memorandum
whirls to face him
he stands looking down over her shoulder
im sorry you had to find that dear
our relationship didnt need this further strain
it wasnt an accident it was you
not me personally
i have an employee who does certain things for me unofficially off the books
robert doesnt like to pay taxes
and now youll kill me
strack spreads his arms
you have nothing on me my dear and youd find the extremely expensive police department quite unsympathetic
consider the big picture
i suppose this is goodbye then
julie stares hatefully at him for a beat then hurries out the door
strack moves quickly to the briefcase
he taps his fingers idly on the coffee stained document
then he hits a button on his desk top intercom
send robert in
strack strolls over to the window and stares out at his rising city
os the door clicks open
enters the room
i have good news and bad
custom dictates that you render the bad news first
you recall the little difficulty with my father and how you resolved it
we have a similar situation with miss hastings
it seems miss hastings has uncovered some unflattering information about us
no problem at all
and the good news
your wife died
im joking of course
no the good news is that i know whos behind our little troubles of late
when you retrieved my memorandum you failed to excise the good doctor
i saw to it myself
i dont like loose ends robert
where is he
i believe we have a guide
a cab stops across the street from the warehouse and julie emerges
as she crosses the street
the street is silent desolate
suddenly from out of nowhere races toward her about to run her over screeches to a stop only inches from her
turns to run
screeches to a halt behind her sandwiching her in
she tries to make a break for the warehouse
guzman races out of one continental smiley out the other
darkman rushes to a window just in time to see julie hustled into one of the continentals
the car roars off
he races toward the door
shatters the three windows and doors of the warehouse
darkman climbs a steel rung ladder and heads for the roof
the bandaged darkman climbs up onto the roof from the service ladder
the rooftop is riddled by bullets
rises suddenly into frame over the edge of peres a roof
leaning o undin h h machine gun p g t e roof with gunfire
hovering over the roof of the warehouse
durant skip and corky inside
darkman rushes to the service ladder and climbs quickly down into the warehouse
is kicked open as smiley and guzman enter guns ps blazing shooting the lab to hell
the gunfire sto and the lab is quiet
guzman speaks quietly into a walkee talkee
from the walkee he just went down from the roof
glances above to the darkened rafters ofathence one to warehouse
then signals for smiley way
he will go another
they split up
the place is eerily still we hear only an occasional computer beep
holy san juan de fuckeen capistrano
hang on parallel clothes lines
durant pauly skip and smiley
in the shadows their eyeless heads are wrinkled and grotesquely life like
guzman moves through the gallery of faces
a breeze through the open window makes the clothes line squeak as the faces bob and nod to him
he stops suddenly
his body shudders at the sight of
hanging on a hook
panics backs into a rack of clothing knocking it over
he races past the wigs the faces
running for his life
emerge from the darkness and latch around his throat
guzman is yanked backward into the blackness without so much as a peep
moves through the dimly lit lab area
gun out checking every crevice
coming closer through the darkness
from the walkee come in smiley come in
come smiley turns off the walkee talkee
are almost atop him
he takes a racing out of the darkness at him
is hip to the darkmans game
the gun belches flame at the masked figure
crumples to the floor
the bottom portion off fece smiley mask is wrinkled exposing a portion beneath
peejz back the mask with the barrel of his gun revealing
loses his smile
a third smiley stands slowly into frame behind the spooked smiley
looks from the dead smiley to his short as the shrieks
but its mercifully cut darkman is upon him
durant yells into the walkee talkee with increasing urgency
guzman come in
what the fuck is going on down there
a burst of static
then i am
durant drops the walkee talkee as if it were something hot
take her down
revised scene s
the pilot lowers the throttle stick and a the chopper swoops down
as the helicopter descends on the roof of the warehouse
i want that son of a bitch eliminated
and i dont want his fingers i want his fucking head
run out onto the roof assault rifles in hand
skip and corky burst inside freezing into combat crouches
they advance slowly across the room
not a sound in the darkness except their footsteps and the occasional beep of a computer
the air is tense with danger
skip and corky whirl around as iron shutters slam down over the windows and doors sealing the lab into an airtight prison
hiss filling the room with the explosive mix of oxygen and acetylene
static on the walkee talkee then revised scerm s
where are you
and durant look toward the entrance of the warehouse
the door is closed
whompi a bandaged hand slams into durants chest grab bim and start hauling him towards the door
the darkman is dragging him out towards the roof
durant mashes the darkmans arm with the door the helicopter starts rising
is yanked from his feet
climbs lifting the darkman clear of the rooftop
skip and corky stand frozen
a small sound
they turn it bobs up
the same toy that destroyed peytons lab
durants lighter lies on a platform just under the beak of the drinking bird
it bobs closer and closer to the switch on the lighter about to make contact
revised scene ms
dives for it snatching it
the hand clenches empty air
the bird is a transparent holograph
skip turns in horror
his pov nearby is the real bird bobbing insynch with the holograph
dips closer to the electronic lighters ignition button
gropes desperately at the floor of the helicopter for a handhold
his fingertips barely touch a rope ladder
slides open the steel door and kicks viciously at his face knocking him overboard
rising straight up as the darkman tumbles backwards in free fall back towards the roof
his overcoat flapping as he somersaults down he throws out one arm and
revised scene s
catches the last rung of the rope ladder that trails from the copter
it snaps taut as ka boom
the roof below him blows
the arm is by the snap of the force of the explosion rocks the helicopter
the pilot loses control and the helicopter spins wildly in rapid s like the speeded up arms of a clock
is barely able to hold onto the ladder
below him p the tiny city is a spinning blur of metal and asphalt and p glass
he pulls the stick
gradually the helicopter rights itself
banks sharply through the concrete canyons a deadly game of crack the whip
is hurled through the window of an office on the th floor of a skyscraper
the darkman still holding the rope finds himself on solid ground
the executives stare in shock at the darkman standing on their table
the faces of the executives whirling in a circle like numbers on a roulette wheel
suddenly the faces start to recede
the darkman is yanked back out the window breaking the remaining glass
pedestrians scurry from the rain of falling glass
camera swishes up to reveal
as it roars away from the skyscraper at an insane angle the pilot having finally managed to regain some control
angles sharply toward a busy freeway
is dipped into oncoming traffic
he barely clears the roof of a cadillac by swinging his legs above it
dangle six feet above the ground whizzing over the asphalt at miles per hour
the legs part as they pass over a motorcycle then close again
swoops lower slamming the darkman to the pavement
he drags for a moment a pack of motorcycles whizzing past his head
like a marionette hes jerked back up right in front of an oncoming delta oldsmobile
he is grazed by the cars hood
his body bounces off the windshield
is lifted straight into the path of a fast moving truck
truck honks furiously
darkman strains his legs
close up tracking over the trucks aluminum roof
run miles an hour along the roof of the truck
darkman manages to loop the bottom rung of the rope ladder to a steel hook on the trucks cab
revised sc g
looking forward over durants and pilots shoulders
the pa at has the stick
we are rushing directly town an overpass
the ladder snaps taut against the hook
we are about to be obliterated
pilot is yanking on the collective the chopper whines
wind whipping at his coat looking up at the doomed helicopter the darkman bellows in triumph
b wind whipping at his coat looking up at the doomed helicopter the darkman bellows his triumph
taking up the entire screen
b darkman laughing on the truck races through the darkness a flaming debris from the helicopter cascading over the mouth of the tunnel
strack sits behind his power desk talking into the phone
weve consolidated the waterfront governor
yes im aware theres been some unpleasantness but thats over now
yes im sure
you sound a little nervous bryant
have a brandy watch a cop show
the door opens
a security officer appears
robert durant sir
send him in
everythings taken care of
he hangs up
we hear the door open and close
stracks smile vanishes
he looks awful face scorched and bruised severe limp
you look like hell robert
the son of a bitch malfunctioned my helicopter
revised scene numbers
f ie mans a cockroach
you think you tall him and he pops up someplace ise
g expect hell pop up here soon
if westlake calls kindly refer him to strack towers
come robert let us kill the girl
rattling up the steel skeleton of a skyscraper p stars all around us
im glad you survived robert
id hate to see your kids deprived of a role model
they do look up to me
the elevator grinds to a halt and the two emerge
the lights of the city tremble over the water
a glitter and breadth to the landscape an urban grandeur
kids need an example robert
when i was a young man my father made me work high steel
thats how he started out and in his view what was good enough for him was good enough for me
strack gestures broadly with one arm
it was just me and the indians no one else crazy enough to run around up here against the wind four fifty an hour
sure i resented it but now call me crazy sometimes i miss it it sharpens your wits
life on the edge
five inches wide
two hundred fifty feet down
he turns to face durant
theres a gun in his hand
you dont have any kids robert
what are you talking about
or should i say doctor westlake
then im going to make a mistake
theres a long beat
the vein begins to pulse on durants temple
his eyes grow predatory evil
wheres the girl
strack hops nimbly out onto a narrow girder
he smiles back over his shoulder
you want to see the girl
follow me ill take you to her
durant darkman follows taking the first few tentative steps
revised scene is z
i must say dr
westlake youve certainly worked some mischief
pretty much wiped out the security arm of strack industries
im a good sport
he leaps from beam to beam durant darkman following cautiously behind
and i can handle my own problems
i do whatever i have to do
in fact thats how i got my first properties
my wife late wife held certain deeds
i sent her on a plane trip over the smokies and well lets just say landed on my feet
as for my father well he was old i spared him a few miserable years
yes we all have dreams dr
westlake but we dont all have what it takes to realize those dreams
all i have are nightmares
then share my dream
after all you and i are pretty much the same
we should be working together
both smart fellows
same taste in women
i could use a man like you
go to hell
he proceeds nimbly along the beam
revised scene s
i guess you just dont have what it takes
i gather you run around wearing other peoples faces now since yours is so
see i could never do that
the world has to take me as i am
and all this tit for tat stuff youve been up to
living in the past
only destroy to build something better whereas you
a ah here we are
julie stands out on the end of a projecting girder at the furthest extremity of the growing building
wind whips at her hair and dress she clings pathetically to an upright
bring on the strings
separated by ruthless forces larger than they
what a banal tale
in it i suppose i play the villain
but wait julie which of us is the monster here
with this he reaches over to durant and squishhhrippp
tears his face off tossing it over the edge
the face spins down whooshing end over end the wind flapping it this way and that
on the way down it slaps against the occasional girder momentarily flattening out into the recognizable face of durant and then peels away again
it spins downward towards a forest of reinforcing bars that form a pungi pit of steel spikes in the open foundation below
finally it lands splat pierced through the eye by one of the rusty re bars
gazes at darkmans ghastly visage for the first time overcome by horror and repulsion
darkmans vein pulses like csa y
strack s tone is almost admiring you truly are one ugly son of a bitch
strack shoots darkman in the shoulder hurling him off the bean
the darkman tumbles limbs flailing bellowing with rage
spinning upside down stars abyss stars abyss as darkmans fingertips clamp onto the upper lip of an i beam
barely hanging on vein pulsing
strack looks down wind whipping his hair
his pov nothing
darkman has been swallowed up by the night
pocketing his gun strack proceeds toward julie
recoils as strack stops in front of her
he touches her hair
first my wife then my father and now he places his hands on her shoulders preparing to push her off the girder
it is the tragedy of my life that i always have to kill the ones i love
as hes about to push her iduis
strack turns around
stands behind him glaring angrily
i shouldve snuffed you out at birth
with that strack sr
rips off his own face exposing the enraged visage of darkman
strack reaches for his gun
darkman mashes his face and the gun flies out of his hand into the darkness below
battle it out on the narrow girder hundreds of feet sure death on either side of them
savage punches send strack reeling bam
he falls onto the girder
nearby are a bunch of tools
strack crawls toward them
conti rn d only a few inches from his grasp
swoops onto strack pummelling him
inching painfully toward the rivet gun
pummelling lost in the act of his final revenge
he steps back to give a final blow
and slips on some loose rivets flailing for balance
darkman slams into a vertical bar
the rivet gun shoots a bolt through darkmans wrist then the other wrist pinning him to the i beam
strack takes a step backward exhausted
now you get to watch your girl friend die
he moves toward a terrified julie
shrieks and reality melts around him as he tastes the hot soup of rage
gigantic fissures appear on all the girders
we spin into darkmans eyeball to find nightmarish flashes of laughing faces jeering into the camera julie and strack kissing naked
stracks face bobs attached now to the body of the dunking bird his nose nearing the ignition of a huge lighter
as contact is made the lighter explodes in a shower of gold krugerands
the gold coins fall away to reveal peytons unscathed head bobbing on a freakish and deformed dolls body
atop a circus platform he does an angry jig
he wears a funny little hat
peytons face liquefies and flows off his head to reveal the face of the darkman
a drop of liquid peyton falls upon
a cube of ice
it bursts into flames
the camera races back from darkmans eye
his vein pulsing madly
insensitive to pain he pulls every sinew concentrated on the task
a horrible grating sounds as the first rivet rips through steel
one hand is freed
the other is freed
with his back to him doesnt have a chance to turn as
he lifts him full into the air
stracks legs and arms flail impotently
darkman hurls him up up into the air
strack rises helpless flailing his limbs
then begins to fall yards away from the girder
he spins end over end to pphhhhfffthhmp
be impaled on the rebars many floors below next to durants face
humming at the cut
darkman and julie are inside
darkman remains turned from julie facing the shadows
gently julie touches his shoulder to draw him toward her
peyton i can help
no one can help
i dont care how you look peyton
the burns dont matter
theres a long pause
then darkman turns the twisted remains of
his face toward her
julie sees them in close up
the elevator jars to a halt on street level
take my hand
julie stares at the charred skeletal fingers
she overcomes her repulsion and puts her hand in his
it disgusts you
darkman stares at her a long time anguished torn
it used to caress you
now it can only tear rip away at things
but youll perfect the skin
youll get rid of the scars
its not just the scars
ive changed he grips his skull
he pulls the elevator open
i can live with it now but i dont think anyone else can
tears in her i want it back
the two of us the way it was
darkmans voice breaks
what we had our life together it belonged in the light of day
he disappears into the darkness
darkmans voice floats back as he stalks away peyton is gone
he heads into the shadows
at the edge of the darkness he pulls a mask from his coat and disappears behind a construction trailer
a pedestrian reappears on the other side
julie knows its
she chases after him but he slips into the pedestrian traffic
the camera hurries down the street with julie as she desperately searches for him turning people around staring at their faces
it begins to snow
she rushes from pedestrian to pedestrian staring into alien faces in search of the man she loves
the camera pulls back into the crowd of pedestrians any one of who could be darkman
we continue to pull back down avenues and side streets byways courtyards wherever the crowd spills into an alley
as a street person shuffles into view snaps open a switch blade
a second set of arms grabs the street person and spins him around revealing
wild half mad eyes gleam wickedly from boney sockets
