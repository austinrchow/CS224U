written by mark boal october rd we hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by world trade center office workers to police and fire departments after the planes struck on
just before the buildings collapsed
we listen to fragments from a number of these calls
starting with pleas for help building to a panic ending with the callers grim acceptance that help will not arrive that the situation is hopeless that they are about to
i own you ammar
you belong to me
look at me
this is daniel stanton the cias man in islamabad a big american late s with a long anarchical beard snaking down to his tattooed neck
he looks like a paramilitary hipster a punk rocker with a glock
explaining the rules if you dont look at me when i talk to you i hurt you
if you step off this mat i hurt you
if you lie to me im gonna hurt you
now look at me
his prisoner ammar stands on a decaying gym mat surrounded by four guards whose faces are covered in ski masks
ammar looks down
instantly the guards rush ammar punching and kicking
look at me ammar
notably one of the guards wearing a ski mask does not take part in the beating
daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation room into the light of day
they remove their masks and we see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid twenties
she has a pale milky innocence and bright blue eyes thin and somewhat frail looking yet possessing a steely core that we will come to realize is off the charts
this is maya a cia targeter and subject matter expert on her first overseas assignment
to the guard are we gonna board up these windows or what
just off the plane from washington youre rocking your best suit for your first interrogation and then you get this guy
its not always this intense
just so you know its going to take awhile
he has to learn how helpless he is
lets get a coffee
no we should go back in
something about the strange intensity of her expression makes daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation room
you know theres no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor
she shakes her head
at the door daniel hands the ski mask back to maya
you might want to put this on
youre not wearing one
is he ever getting out
ammar bruised from the beating is restrained with ropes
maya stands a few feet behind daniel attentive wary of what is to come
this is her first interrogation and she is on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room
she looks around at the sound proofed walls the puddles of water on the floor
right now this is about you coming to terms with your situation
its you and me bro
i want you to understand that i know you that ive been studying you for a very long time
i could have had you killed karachi
but i let you live so you and i could talk
you beat me when my hands are tied
i wont talk to you
life isnt always fair my friend
did you really think that when we got you id be a nice fucking guy
youre a mid level guy
youre a garbage man in a corporation
why should i respect you
and youre a money man
daniel paces around ammar anger rising
a disgrace to humanity
you and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people
i have your name on a five thousand dollar transfer via western union to a hijacker
he leans into ammars ear
and you got popped with kilograms of high explosives in your house
and then daniel smiles laughs
im just fucking with you
he laughs again
i dont want to talk about
what i want to focus on is the saudi group
daniel shows him a photo
that there is hazem al kashmiri
and i know this dude is up to some serious shit and what i want from you is his saudi email
feel free to jump in
ammar bro i know that you know this dude just give me his email
and i will give you a blanket
i will give you a blanket and some solid food
no response from ammar
daniel starts putting on his gloves
i know that you know him
i told you before i wont talk to you
have it your way
to the masks lets go
it all happens in a flash in one swift motion daniel pushes ammar to the floor the guards pin his limbs and daniel smothers ammars face with a towel
daniel considers his next move
grab the bucket
maya follows daniels gesture to the corner of the room where theres an ice chest filled with water and a plastic put some water in it
she dips the pitcher in the water hands shaking
cmon lets go
the stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings the bucket back to daniel
daniel starts pouring the water on ammars face which is now covered by a towel
ammar thrashes with rising panic
hazem was a friend of ramzi yousef you guys met in tunisia back in the s
gasping for breath i dont know you asshole
maya shakes her head no
thats not credible
why are you doing this to me
youre a terrorist thats why im doing it to you
daniel pours water over the towel so it hits ammars nose
i want emails of the rest of the saudi group
give me emails of the rest of the saudi group
give me one email and i will stop this
ammar doesnt speak
whos in the saudi group and whats the target
where was the last time you saw bin laden
where was the daniel throws the pitcher rips the rag off ammars mouth and water spurts out ammar nearly drowned
he gasps for air
this is what defeat looks like bro
your jihad is over
get him up
the guards bring ammar to his feet
daniel shifting his persona yet again touches ammars face and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist
try to understand the concept here
i have time you dont
i have other things to do you dont
its cool that youre strong
i respect it i do
but in the end everybody breaks bro
dan and maya exit
theyve learned nothing
a colorful dusty city
meanwhile across town national flags
the outpost of a superpower
maya drives through the checkpoint and up to the main gate
descending the lobby staircase with daniel is joseph bradley chief of station pakistan a smooth vain sophisticated former case officer who hasnt quite buffed all the blood out of his
how did it go the other night
it was good
the local cops need tactical help
but hes tier fucking one baby
theres your money maker
this is the guy thats ksms nephew
whats his issue
hes being a dick
if hes trying to outsmart you tell him about your phd
i am going to have to turn up the heat
he needs to give us the saudi group now
they reach the lobby where they can see maya sitting in the holding area
they walk towards her as bradley considers what daniel is asking for
hes gotta have that given the family ties
permission granted daniel reassures his boss
tight with his uncle prints all over the money
daniel knocks on the glass for maya to come in
to bradley clocking her good looks was i lying or what
the guard opens the door and maya comes through not many females come through that door
maya this is joseph bradley our illustrious station chief
as they shake hands joe and i did iraq together
and we continue our christian mission here
nice to meet you
you too sir
how was your flight
they walk down the lobby towards the secure wing
shes been having a great time ever since she got in isnt that right
how do you like pakistan so far
its kinda fucked up
you volunteered for this didnt you
he knew she didnt volunteer
they reach a secure area and bradley checks maya through an electronic door
third floor northeast corner
she goes through and daniel and bradley watch her walk away
dont you think shes a little young for the hard stuff
washington says shes a killer
the childrens crusade
they want the next generation on the field
listen i have a meeting with isi in twenty minutes
theyre slow rolling us in lahore you might want to bitch about that
did you see the cable from london
dude ive been in a dark room with another man for the last two days
maya finds her desk
its covered with grime
she tries to clean it as best she can then sits and looks at the blank log in screen of her computer
a group of thirty somethings filing in for a meeting chatting comradery taking seats around a conference table
we will get to know jack mid s a scruffy teddy bear the liaison from the national security agency nsa
jessica s an experienced targeter and the only woman in the station who wears a skirt
some dude tells the malaysian station that his nephew works with a guy who knows a guy here we go
hold on he goes to a big feast in bangkok about a year ago
the guest of honor
usama bin laden
laughter in the room
so i say was tupac there too
right but you forgot you forgot mullah omar
and jeremy two case officers continue the banter this is worth million bucks
you know were going to have to chase it down
thats me man
no job too small
thats why i have a gift for you my friend
jack hands jeremy a piece of paper
daniel and maya enter a little late
everyone this is maya
please dont ask how its going with ammar because shes not going to fucking tell you
ammar is withholding
reading from her washington assesses that abu faraj is officially our new number three jessica moves to a wall chart of aq leadership and repositions abu farajs mugshot to number
three in the line two down from usama bin laden
meanwhile in the background the riffs continue best man for it
london station is already asking if we think hes in contact with anyone in the u
like were just keeping it from them
jessica sits back down and gets down to business
the jordanians are being really helpful with ammars transit papers
jessica passes daniel a file
any imminent threats in here
they want the consulate the marriott its low security
and theyve got majid kahn talking about gas stations in the us
and thats a conversation
at this point she believes that it is merely a conversation not a fully realized plot
there are six hundred questions in there
id concentrate on heathrow
does it matter what faraj thinks about heathrow
how much latitude does he get to pick targets
i think hell give up the saudis
but heathrow is gonna be tough
anything from last night
quetta base thinks they have a bead on the arabs that escaped and theyre going to meet with the isi this afternoon hopefully to set up a raid down there
and lahore reporting isi down there was painfully slow last night
im beginning to think its not incompetence
i agree i spoke to the chief about that
anything on bin laden
reading from a cable a farmer on the afghan border near tora bora reports a diamond shaped pattern in the hills tall male in the center of the diamond flanked
by four guards
its consistent with ubls movements
thats supposed to be his royal guard
thats pre behavior
jessica doesnt appreciate the challenge
we dont have reason to believe hes changed security tactics
we invaded afghanistan
thats a reason
and so the rivalry begins
hey boss i got a guy for five thousand bucks he can set up a taxi stand and snoop around a bit
no dont need him the diamond sighting is bullshit
see if the paks will send someone to talk to the farmer
we need to be putting runs on the board against faraj
speak to the case officers who didnt see fit to make it today
and thank them
the loud wailing of the early morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes maya on the couch
daniel and the guards enter ammars cell with maya
daniel switches on a floodlight awakening ammar
lets take it easy today huh
daniel hands ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of falafel
the food in here sucks so i got you some of this
ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels
richard reid wow
i was thinking about him
the guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane
you know him dont you
slowly ammar nods
im glad you said that
i have an email from you to him
ive had all your coms for years bro
who else is in your saudi group
i just handed out some cash for them
i didnt know who the guys were
when you lie to me i hurt you
i believe you
i do i believe you
do you want the water again or do you want something else
just give me a name
daniel jumps up
i dont know
daniel kicks out the chair from under ammar
the masked guards walk to the rope pulleys
you see how this works
you dont mind if my female colleague sees your junk do you
daniel pulls down ammars pants
maya flinches at the bare nakedness
dude you shit your pants
daniel turns to maya you stay here ill be back
daniel goes out leaving maya standing alone in front of the naked chained man
ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his eyes
your friend is an animal
please help me
a long beat
you can help yourself by being truthful
the door handle turns
it occurs to maya that perhaps daniel was testing her resilience too as daniel re enters with a dog collar in his hand
this is a dog collar
daniel unhooks ammar snaps the collar and leash around his neck as ammar cries out against the humiliation
daniel is relentless you determine how i treat you
now daniel drags ammar on all fours pulling him by the leash
im going to walk you
maya watches in horror as daniel walks ammar to a far corner of the room then leans down to address his victim what the fuck do you think is going
wahleed has already told me that you know
at last daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a large wooden box resting on a platform
this box sucks
im going to put you in it
ammar tries to speak but cant get a word out
when is the attack
this sunday or next sunday
ammar mumbles almost inaudibly
is it sunday or monday
ammar doesnt answer
the masked men approach
which day is it
partial information is treated as a lie
the masked men open the box
the guards grab ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb
he shouts with his last reserve of energy monday
ammar which day
monday tuesday beat
daniel slams the box shut
once again hes learned nothing
ecu a magazine clicks into the receiver of a black assault rifle
the weapon carried by a bearded arab man dressed in street clothes rises to shoulder height
the man enters the hallway of the khobar residential towers and immediately opens fire on two western men he happens to find inside killing them both
the crack of the shots sends the rest of the residents into a panicky screaming dash for cover as he strides quickly down the hall he finds three other residents
scrambling for safety and shoots and kills them all
cu tv news footage of the massacre
daniel jessica and maya look on in defeat
the saudi attack they tried to prevent by pressuring ammar has occurred
dont worry about the saudis theyll take care of business
you warned them they didnt take you seriously this is what happens
its not on you
who said that
this is on me
ammar is on me
and its on her
pointing to maya we cant let this be a win win for no no no
you had what days brief custody and an unresponsive ally
the way you do this is you look ahead
that plan is still active
ammar doesnt have a clue about what happened
you have to be really careful with people in ksms circle theyre devious
hes not going to talk about attacks on the homeland
hes going to withhold operational details on the ksm network and probably on bin laden
flipping her argument but hes been in complete isolation he doesnt know we failed
we can tell him anything
he hasnt slept dan
you dont remember do you
you me same same
while guards move in the deep b
daniel and maya are seated at a picnic table with an appetizing spread of arabic food
short term memory loss is a side effect of sleep deprivation
it should come back to you
the guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood ammar
he stares weakly at the table
i dont know
how can i remember
after we kept you awake for hours you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people
which is the smart thing to do youre starting to think for yourself
ammar is lost
but the food is tempting
you earned it
so you flew via amman to kabul to hang out with your uncle
how did you know that
i told you man i know you
alright you got me flight manifests
it mustve been pretty fucked up for you guys after
what did you do after the invasion and before you went back to pesh
after i had to choose fight to protect our turf or run
you chose to fight
ammar looks daniel right in the eyes
i wanted to kill americans
we tried to get into tora bora but the bombing was too high
we couldnt cross
sorry who is the we in that sentence
me and some guys who were hanging around at that time
i can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling
hamza rabia khabab al masri and abu ahmed
maya makes notes on her pad
whos abu ahmed
ive heard of the other guys
he was a computer guy with us at the time
after tora bora i went back to pesh as you know and he went north i think to kunar
whats his family name
abu ahmed al kuwaiti
abu ahmed means father of ahmed its a kunya
ammar i know the difference between a war name and an arabic name
she got you there dude
i swear to you both i dont know his family name
i would have never asked him something like that
its not how my uncle worked
my uncle told me he worked for bin laden
i did see him once about a year ago in karachi
he read us all a letter from the sheikh
what did it say
daniel offers ammar a smoke
daniels lights it
it said continue the jihad
the work will go on for a hundred years
we fade into a dimly lit research room where maya is alone watching interrogation video recordings on an array of monitors
some of the videos are rough but most simply depict two people talking
the video shes watching now shows a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room the walls smeared with red stains
you and i are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps yeah
the prisoner sits in a chair
hes hooded but relaxed
some of these brothers have done some bad things and what i want to do is i want to separate them from the people like you
there was a guy called abu ahmed from kuwait
yes i remember him
a nice guy
how close was he
what was his relationship to the leadership
i dont know
did he eat with you guys did he eat with the good guys or did he eat with the leadership
i dont know sir
i have no idea about things like that
yes you do you dont need an idea maya hits pause and we see that her desk is filled with open windows of interrogations she is analyzing ten videos simultaneously
comparing them to each other
she plays another video showing a turkish prison
when you met with khalid sheikh mohammed was this one of the facilitators
the interrogator flashes a picture
the prisoner moans
is this abu ahmed
she fast forwards a video shot in a polish facility
the prisoner appears to be cold
ksm your boss
mukhtar potato you say potahto
i say fucking ksm but yeah mukhtar
after mukhtar was captured what did abu ahmed do
abu ahmed i believe he went to work for the sheikh
maya is still in the research room
shes been going at this for hours and looks fatigued
cu screen a different interrogator from the previous video prisoner is an older man chained to a desk
the exchange is in arabic with an english subtitle on the screen in karachi in or
he was carrying a letter from bin laden
still going looking exhausted now maya manipulates the controls of yet another video clip with a different interrogator and prisoner
were now in a moroccan facility
the interrogator shows him a photograph of a bearded man
henceforth the photograph
is that him
the interrogator holds the photograph right in front of the prisoners face allowing us to see it as well
a yemeni prison the dialogue is a mix of french and english abu ahmed is he the courier for bin laden
who knows who works directly for bin laden
lets say hes part of the mix
were there other people who carried messages from bin laden
how many other people
four or five
lets talk about them the image freezes
maya stares at the screen
maya is in the kitchen grabbing something to eat
jessica the only other person working this late walks in pours herself some coffee
hows the needle in the haystack
facilitators come and go but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money
the rivalry is in full bloom
sometimes its friendly
sometimes its not so friendly
youre assuming that al qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards
youre assuming that greed wont override ideology in some of the weaker members
money for walk ins worked great in the cold war ill give you that
just not sure those tactics are applicable to the middle east
maya hastily throws her clothes and a wig into a suitcase the worlds fastest packing job
a sprawling shipyard in an industrial area
a large military frigate sits in the harbor
a dark haired woman and a man board the ship
at first we dont recognize the woman with heavy makeup walking down the narrow corridor and then we realize its maya in disguise
she enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle aged afghan man thick shouldered with years of hard experience in his kind somewhat sad eyes
this fatherly man is hakim a former political prisoner in afghanistan and one of the cias most important assets
in the galley a prisoner is chained to a table
hakim slides him the photograph
the prisoner speaks in arabic
he says he looks like abu ahmed
who did he work for
then the prisoner speaks
it was mostly with abu faraj they were always together
what did he do for faraj
he carried messages from faraj to bin laden and from bin laden back to faraj
maya leans into hakim
we need to ask him something to see if hes telling the truth
we dont know if he really knew faraj
hakim speaks to the prisoner
he just told me the names of all of farajs children
i think hes telling the truth
maya is pitching bradley in his office
bradley sits with his feet up on his desk holding the photograph
daniel is slouched on the couch in back
jessica is perched on the arm of the couch bare legs crossed
twenty detainees recognize that photo of abu ahmed
they say hes part of the inner circle of guys who were hanging out in afghanistan pre
a lot of them say that after he went to work for ksm
when ksm got captured he went to work for abu faraj primarily as a courier from faraj to bin laden
well thats good
you still yeah we dont know if abu is on the outside of the network part of a series of cutouts and dead drops or if he has a direct
connection to bin laden
does bin laden invite him into the living room and hand him a letter directly
or is abu just the last guy in a long line of couriers so thats why everybody knows him
thats not all you dont know
you dont have his true name and you dont have a clue of where he is
we know that hes important
the fact that everybodys heard of abu ahmed but nobody will tell me where he is suggests that
detainees could withhold his location for any number of reasons
perhaps they dont know perhaps this abu is just a cover story and hes really a fucking unicorn
the withholding doesnt reveal what you want it to does it
and if you did find him you dont know that hed be with bin laden
we dont know what we dont know
what the fuck is that supposed to mean
its a tautology
back to maya listen not one single detainee has said that hes located with the big guy just that he delivers messages
am i wrong
its still good work
let me know when youve got some actionable intelligence preferably something that leads to a strike
the city is in full swing on this bright mid summer morning
cars and buses roll through the crowded streets
passengers inside the bus read newspapers listen to music
another ordinary day
then the bus explodes
file footage of the aftermath this is what remains of the bus which was traveling through tavistock square
joseph bradley sits at his desk
the weight of the world on his shoulders
on the television in the background the news report continues showing disaster footage of people bloodied screaming
the war on terror is growing and spreading like an octopus throughout the base
we trace the new tentacles of the cia facility more hangars vehicles people moving to and fro
all around groups of londoners are standing on corners asking themselves
what has happened here and who could possibly have done this
we find daniel trying to catch a moment of solitude
eating an ice cream cone and standing in front of a makeshift cage filled with wild monkeys
the monkeys are watching daniel intently their hands gripping the wire cage
daniel playfully feeds them some of his ice cream
a cia guard approaches daniel re the monkeys you agency guys are twisted
the detainee is ready
daniel nods weary
then a monkey reaches through the bars and steals the remainder of daniels ice cream cone
he looks at the monkey and laughs
rain pelts the brown city turning the gutter water black
i want you to understand that i know you
i have been following you and studying you for a long time
i chased you in lahore
we find maya entering the gates of a pakistani prison
the weather makes the place seem especially bleak
hassan ghul al qaeda financier sits manacled to a desk
i had you picked up instead of killing you because youre not a violent man and you dont deserve to die
but you do have deep ties to al qaeda that i want to ask you about before you get sent to your next location which might be israel
ghul looks ashen
however depending on how candid you are today i may be able to keep you in pakistan
what do you want to know
im going to ask you a series of questions based on your knowledge of al qaeda and your position as key financier for the organization
i have dealt with the mukhabarat i have no wish to be tortured again
ask me a question i can answer it
what can you tell me about atiyah abd al rahman
he works for zawahiri
hes in charge of military tactics
in what context have you ever heard the name abu ahmed
he works for faraj and bin laden
he is his most trusted courier
maya works hard to hide how pleased she is to have this confirmation
shes not entirely successful
what makes you say that
he brought me many messages from the sheikh
where did you last see him and where is he now
you will never find him
why is that
even i couldnt find him
he always contacted me out of the blue
he is one of the disappeared ones
pakistani families enjoy a fine summer day
a bomb is being strapped to a mans leg by a pakistani you know how this works
the man is terrified
just act naturally
the policeman finishes securing the bomb and sends the man out the door who we will later deduce is abu farajs courier
farajs courier walks past playing children
while from a nearby tower daniel observes
after a moment abu faraj who we recognize from his photograph appears at the south end of the park
faraj walks in the direction of his courier noting his children playing
several people in black burkhas
at last faraj reaches an open area where he can see his courier face to face
they exchange a nervous glance that conveys the danger its a trap
faraj spins to flee but its too late
the black burkhas descend on him
it turns out they are heavily armed pakistani agents
from on high daniel watches his captured prey
daniel and an armed guard escort a hooded and handcuffed faraj to his cell
what do you like
just let me know if theres music you like i can make a call
daniel and the guards take faraj to a cell laced with barbed wire and lock him inside
can i be honest with you
im bad news
im not your friend
im not gonna help you
im gonna break you
ive done it before
faraj dozes weak hey wake up
you havent eaten in hours weve got to keep your energy up
guards force feed faraj through a feeding tube
bradley approaches maya at her cubicle
youre in luck i got you a one on one with faraj
dont thank me until you hear what i want for it
he drops a folder on her desk
i want you to take care of all of this before your favorite subject
dont you want to see whats in the folder
you want family ties financial networks media sources disgruntled employees imminent threats homeland plots thank you
foreign cells health status trade craft recruiting tactics anything else
both maya and faraj look tired
this has been going on for hours
a lot of brothers told us abu ahmed was bin ladens courier and that he worked very closely with you
youre thinking of abu khalid
my courier for the sheikh
okay so youre telling me that all the other brothers are wrong and theres some famous buluchi guy that is working for you and bin laden that ive never even
why should you have heard of him
what does this buluchi guy look like
tall long white beard thin
he uses a cane
kind of like gandolf
when was the last time you saw him
a month ago in karachi but i dont know where he is now
sometimes i wouldnt even see him he would just tell me where to leave the messages
i dont believe you
the guard in the room with them leans forward and slaps faraj across the face
farajs expression doesnt change and maya herself remains flat and steady unmoved by the violence
shes not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago
youre not being fulsome in your replies
you cant force me to tell you something i dont know
you do realize this is not a normal prison
you determine how you are treated and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information i need
the guard slaps faraj again
faraj is impassive
maya looks on impassively as faraj is subjected to harsh treatment
maya is retching in the stall
maya walks around the facility quiet at this hour and finds another insomniac daniel by the monkey cage
the cage is empty
faraj is completely denying knowing abu ahmed and thats using every measure we have
hes either going to withhold or die from the pressure youre putting on him
do you want to take a run at him
you know ive been meaning to tell you im getting outta here
ive just seen too many guys naked
its gotta be over a hundred at this point
i need to go do something normal for awhile
go to washington do the dance see how that environment works
you should come with me
be my number two
youre looking a little strung out yourself
maya looks at dan
no longer the man he once was
she doesnt hide her disappointment
im not going to find abu ahmed from they both look at the empty cage clocking the irony
they killed my monkeys
something about an escape
can you fucking believe that
look maya you gotta be really careful with detainees now
the politics are changing and you dont want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes
and watch your back when you get back to pakistan
everyone knows you there now
back in pakistan the country has indeed changed to a more militarized police state and as we establish the new environment we find mayas grey sedan
the car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by pakistani police
the policeman look at the car look at the plate the plate is diplomatic they walk around the car and stop at the window shine their bright light right into
a policeman motions for her to roll down her window
where are you going
to the marriott
i assume you noticed the dip plates
but you have a bag the policeman motions to a duffel bag resting on the rear seat
its a gym bag
maya does not get out of the car
she stares at him defiantly
he advances forward a bit
she rolls up her window flicks the door lock and starts dialing her cell phone
the policeman walks away to rejoin his group
the police confer
the original policeman returns this time with several other cops
they knock on the glass
maya stares straight ahead
jessica is waiting at the table in a beautifully appointed room
maya walks in flustered
maya sits down absorbed in her blackberry
maya puts away her blackberry
look i know abu ahmed is your baby but its time to cut the umbilical cord
no its not
so faraj went south on you it happens
there are still cells in london and spain planning the next round of attacks
i can work on it at the same time plus i think its a good thing that he lied
no not at the expense of protecting the homeland you cant
wait a minute why is it a good thing
you sound just like bradley
he doesnt believe in my lead either
its a good thing because the fact that faraj withheld on abu ahmed is revealing
the only other thing he lied about was the location of bin laden himself
that means faraj thinks abu ahmed in as important to protect as bin laden
that confirms my lead
or its confirmation bias
were all just worried about you okay
is that okay to say
maya rubs her eyes not liking where the conversation is going
she forces a smile
hes probably stuck in some check point somewhere
you two hooked up yet
hello i work with him
im not that girl that fucks
a little foolin around wouldnt hurt you
so no boyfriend
do you have any friends at all
jessicas phone rings its jack
hey thats okay
as alarms wail maya struggles to her feet grabs jessica by the arm and they stumble to safety
toward the destroyed kitchen helping each other over obstacles twisted metal gaps in the concrete etc past injured workers and burning flames
they continue moving through the debris as the smoke intensifies
they find each others hands and grab tightly
the destroyed marriott
the blast left a crater meters wide in front of the hotel
the marriott one of the most popular destinations for locals and westerners
were high above the wild hinterlands of the hindu kush gliding over the rocky slopes and the pine forests
we move from peak to peak until we find a remote valley and we zoom down
and nestled in the valley we can just make out the barest outlines of a tiny village of mud huts
now we are inside a hut and weve shifted to the perspective of a hand held camera as if someone inside this stone age interior is filming on our behalf
and we see a hard floor thin gaps in the walls and five tribal elders talking casually eating and drinking tea
we pan across the weathered faces long beards and see a video recorder resting on a ledge
jessica strides excitedly almost breaking into a run through the warren of cubicles that lead to mayas desk
jessica beaming as she approaches maya
the jords have a mole
jessica pops a cd into mayas computer loads a file that plays the same video clip we have just seen
he made this video to prove his bona fides
shut the fuck up
the camera stops on one man balawi
humam khalil al balawi hes a jordanian doctor
hes really motivated
maya practically bolts out of her chair
together they start walking towards bradleys office this could be it
this is it
bradley has just finished watching the video
maya and jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict
hes right there in the inner circle
i dont buy it
didnt you tell me yourself nobody turns on al qaeda
the jords worked him for a year
theyve convinced him that its his patriotic duty to turn on al qaeda and get rich doing it
yeah so the jords say
we cant rely on the jords
we have to evaluate him face to face
he may not be that smart
he may be full of shit but we have to talk to him to find out
the key is to meet him so we can figure out for ourselves what he can actually do
he really asked for a dialysis machine
you can fill the damn thing with poison
maya and a few analysts are watching tv president elect obama is being interviewed on minutes when jessica comes into the room with disappointing news the meeting with balawi is
he cant come here to islamabad
cant or wont
hes not going to travel security the tv interview with obama reaches the subject of enhanced interrogation and the women pause to listen to the president elect declare america does
then they continue he wants us to go to him
hell meet in miram sha or the tribals
he knows were white
youll get kidnapped up there
david an analyst adds his two cents to the conversation we could do it somewhere else germany or the uk
hes got a clean passport
hes not going to travel out of al qaeda territory
and youre not going to him
what about camp chapman
that could be safe territory
we survey the sprawling base from above
helicopters and humvees traverse the base
jessica applies icing to a birthday cake as she cradles a
this may be going overboard but i baked him a cake
muslims dont celebrate with cake
dont be so literal
everyone likes cake
its not too late for you to come you know
it will be fun
maya sits in front of a series of monitors
she watches a live predator feed
i dont want to be a straphangar
its your show
you were the first to see the potential in this
weve got lots of wine
the target on mayas monitor disappears in a puff of smoke
bring me back a bottle
jessica pours two glasses of wine and raises a toast to her colleague john
not to get technical but this guy is actually the first big break weve had since
to big breaks and the little people that make them happen
so far everything hes said weve cross checked and its proved legit
and i think the money is persuasive
that buys a new life
do you think he might be exaggerating his access
but al qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise
in six months to a year if he doesnt fuck up he could be called in to treat bin laden
and at that moment with mil on the table i think he gives up the big man
and if he doesnt we kill him
the same gathering as the day before waiting under the merciless sun
jessica turns to her crew which includes lauren a young operative zied a jordanian intelligence agent and the bases cia security guard among others
they rehearse the impending meeting
john turns to her when he arrives ill set the tone and then ill flip it to you and youll talk about asset protection
then lauren i know you want to get some questions in there but give balawi time after john speaks
well cover the basics and have his birthday cake then well get to the nitty gritty
jessica turns to zied
is that order okay or do you want to introduce everyone
ill introduce you and you introduce your team
he knows this is a high level meeting
quick question all is taking place inside our main building
washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that
the director is in the loop
and i wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt update the president
yeah im on it
they take in the possibilities
now i just need to get balawis ass down here
waiting and waiting
no cars approach
the sun beats down
several hundred yards before the camp entrance is a beat up sedan
the car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesnt proceed
to the security gyard why are there gate guards there
we talked about this no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives
you might have spooked him already
procedures only work if we follow them every time
this time is different im sorry i cant explain but its for a good cause
look im responsible for everyones safety okay
its not just about you
i just need them to go away for a minute
you can search him as soon as he gets here
the security guard pauses then into his radio all stations go ahead and stand down
the guards move away from their post
the sedan drives past the gate into a maze of barriers
we follow the car as it navigates the maze of hesco barriers kicking up a cloud of dust
jessica runs back to her team and flashes a thumbs up
she smiles and pulls out her phone sending a text
the car navigates the second set of barriers
maya types on her computer wassup you talking yet
jessica looks up to see the car approaching and puts the phone back in her pocket
the sedan is now yards away
okay hes coming
were gonna search him when he gets here
the car gets closer and closer a driver in front and a passenger in back
maya texts again answer when you can
the sedan pulls to a stop
a blackwater guard taps on the backseat window
balawi exits on the passenger side
his free hand is in his pocket
to the other guard is he supposed to limp like that
take your hand out of your pocket
allahu akbar allahu akbar raising his m get you hand out of your pocket
jessicas smile fades and balawi detonates a suicide vest hidden under this jacket and the resulting shrapnel storm pulps the crowd massacring them all
maya looks at her computer screen
she sees her last instant message
and waits for a response
maya looks up concern on her face
the explosion smoke still hovers over camp chapman
news reporting of the attack plays over the horrific image
maya huddles on the floor under the corner of her desk
the office has thinned out and most people have gone home for the day
maya is crouched in the corner
a wounded animal
jeremy the case officer from the conference room approaches and gives maya a computer disc
i didnt think this day could get any worse but bad news from saudi intelligence
the courier guy abu ahmed is dead
its a detainee video
maya still fighting to contain her grief takes the file as an almost welcome distraction
she puts the disc into her computer and hits play
cu computer screen a prisoner being interviewed by a cia case officer holds the photo of abu ahmed weve seen so many times
hes dead in afghanistan
i buried him with my own hands
maya stares at the screen
i dont believe this
sorry maya i always liked this lead
jeremy leaves maya at her computer
she continues to stare at the screen
maya is still by herself
her friend jack approaches hey
sorry i just got here
what are you gonna do
im going to smoke everybody involved in this op and then im going to kill bin laden
off the darkness in her eyes we the staff has gathered to hear a word from the boss in a large conference room its packed shoulder to shoulder with dozens
of people including maya jim jack hakim and bradley at the front
george wright chief of the afghanistan pakistan department has just flown in from d
a big man striding quickly into the room with the street roll of the bronx projects he grew up in george looks ready for a brawl
i want to make something absolutely clear
if you thought there was some secret cell somewhere working al qaeda i want you to know that youre wrong
this is it
theres no working group coming to the rescue
he stares at his staff
theres nobody else hidden away on some other floor
there is just us
and we are failing
were spending billions of dollars
people are dying
were still no closer to defeating our enemy
they attacked us on land in by sea in and from the air in
they murdered three thousand of our citizens in cold blood and theyve slaughtered our forward deployed
and what the fuck have we done about it
what have we done
we have twenty leadership names and weve only eliminated four of them
i want targets
do your fucking jobs bring me people to kill
the office has grown bigger and busier and the cubicle maze is filled with many new faces of young agents excited to be in pakistan
sitting alone at her desk we find maya just as shes finishing a report
she gets up crosses the room and goes to the desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic enthusiasm of the way maya was six years ago
this is debbie
i painstakingly combed through everything in the system and found this
she hands maya a file
he was one of ten names on a watch list sent to us by the moroccans after ibrahim sayeed
they told us to watch out for him apparently they think his whole family and extended family is bad and has ties to ksm
he was picked up for fake papers and a doctored exit visa leaving afghanistan traveling through morocco en route to kuwait
abu ahmed al kuwaiti
this must be abu ahmed
doesnt matter but i wish i had that five years ago
how come i never saw it before
nobody saw it most likely
there was a lot of white noise after countries wanting to help out we got millions of tips and
things got lost in the shuffle
maya turns her attention back to the white board and as debbie keeps talking we follow mayas gaze across the row of mug shots of al qaeda personnel
while a few of the men are african or are distinctive looking for other reasons most of them look fairly similar in that theyre all wearing the same type of
clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly beards
anyway i thought you should know about it
i just want to say ive heard a lot about you
you inspired me to come to pakistan
mayas eyes narrow
she keeps looking at the white board maybe youll let me buy you a kabob sometime
dont eat out
its too dangerous
maya stares at the al quaeda mugshots a thought crosses her mind
maya on the speaker phone to daniel
daniel is now a suit in langley
dan debbie found abu ahmed
he was in the files this whole time
the family name is sayeed
ok but hes dead
so doesnt that make him a little less interesting to you
he may not be
we now know that abu ahmed is one of eight brothers
all the brothers in the family look alike
three of them went to afghanistan
isnt it possible that when the three eldest brothers grew beards in afghanistan they started to look alike
i think the one calling himself abu ahmed is still alive
the picture weve been using is wrong
its of his older brother habeeb
hes the one thats is dead
okay what are you basing this on
we have no intercepts about abu ahmed dying
we just have a detainee who buried somebody who looked like abu ahmed
but if somebody as important as abu ahmed had died theyd be talking about it online in chat rooms all over the place
plus the detainee said that habeeb died in
we know that abu ahmed was alive then trying to get into tora bora with ammar
that means its probably one of the other brothers thats dead
in other words you want it to be true
yes i fucking want it to be true
maya slams the desk
i am calm
state your request
move heaven and earth and bring me this fucking sayeed familys phone number
a dark window shades down executive office where in the shadows a white american man in a nice suit is kneeling on a prayer rug and saying the islamic daily
daniel waits as the man recites the prayers and presses his pale forehead to the carpet
this is wolf
he is the head of the agencys counter terrorism center georges boss
as salamu alaykum
i need a couple hundred thousand
where you gonna get that
you think so
this could crack open the facilitator mayas been looking for by giving us a phone number
shes your killer wolf
you put her on the field
reciting a phrase from the koran in arabic then loosely allah rewards those who strive and fight over those that sit behind a desk
if the blatant attempt to play on his muslim belief bothers him he doesnt show it at all
as you know abu ghraib and gitmo fucked us
the detainee program is now fly paper
we got senators jumping out of our asses and the director is very concerned
they will not stop until they have a body
there it is
the quid pro quo
theres a reason hes called the wolf
daniel considers all that hell go through if he volunteers to be the fall guy for the controversial program
i ran it
ill defend it
daniel and a kuwaiti business man in a suit are drinking and ogling the russian girls prowling the place
after a few sips of his drink
its good to be back in kuwait
its good to see you again its been awhile
the businessman doesnt answer
i need a favor
why should i help you
because were friends
you say we are friends
how come you only call me when you need help
but when i need something you are too busy to pick up the phone
i dont think we are friends
how about a v lamborghini
hows that for friendship
they wait while a lamborghini salesman disheveled clearly just awakened unlocks the door of the dealership
to the kuwaiti the poor fucker had to get out of bed
to the salesman as salamu alaykum
thanks my friend
they step inside and the salesman flicks on the lights revealing shiny cars displayed like jewels on rotating
while the kuwaiti businessman peers inside a silver model daniel confers with the salesman like hes bought twenty of these cars
is this a balboni
this is nice
what are you thinking
i think ill choose this one
the salesman retreats to a back office
thats a nice choice my friend
daniel gives the kuwaiti a slip of paper
who is it
who do you think
the guys a terrorist
his mother lives here
i just need her phone number
there will be no repercussions in kuwait
somebody might die at some point in pakistan
they shake hands
sound graphs of phone calls fill the screen
we cruise through rows upon rows of server facilities a single monitor in front traces a call to rawalpindi pakistan
maya chews on a peanut butter jelly sandwich
jack calls her on her cell
youre not gonna like this hes on the phone but theres no team to deploy right now
she dashes out runs down the hall to an exit sign bursts through the door to a staircase flies down the staircase down to another floor barges through the door
the stations surveillance team leader larry unstraps his flack vest
he looks like the kind of guy you dont mess with
so of course maya barges into his space like a locomotive
how come you havent deployed a team to stay in rawalpindi
for one thing its dangerous
for another the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence
thats why you should forward deploy so you can shorten your response time
still it wouldnt work
the guy never stays on the phone long enough
you havent tried
look i dont have the personnel
as it is my guys dont get any sleep tracking the threats within pakistan
larry pushes past her to leave and she follows him
right i understand
but i dont really care if your guys get sleep or not
maya looks at larrys team sleeping on the couch
the conversation continues in the bar for maya has not relented although the tone is softer now
she offers larry a beer
he takes it
this guy youre obsessed with whats his name again
abu ahmed al kuwaiti is the nom de guerre
his true name we think is ibraheem sayeed
his family lives in kuwait
wasnt it like eight brothers and a million cousins that we know about anyone could be calling home i know its not like hes saying hey mom its me the
over the course of two months hes called home from six different pay phones from two different cities never using the same phone twice
and when his mother asked him where he was he lied
he said that he was in a place in the country with bad cell reception implying he was in the tribals but he was in
a market in peshawar
im sorry but thats not normal guy behavior
maybe he just doesnt like his mom
look if he talks about an operation or refers to anything remotely fishy ill get on him
look abu ahmed is too smart to tip his hand by talking about ops on the phone he works for bin laden
the guys that talk about ops on the phone dont get that job
larry looks away
a lot of my friends have died trying to do this
i believe i was spared so i could finish the job
the girl is a true believer as pure as they come
larry looks at her
her sincerity is persuasive
and just like that he decides to help her
hakim walks through a crowded call center
larry joins him from a back entrance
they look around nothing
hakim parks in front of the rawal call center
the call center is arranged into two rows of cubby holes each separated by a privacy wall
hakim searches the place finds nothing
cu tv screen news reports of the attemped nyc bombing
it is in surveillance video and pictures like this of the explosive laden vehicle just moments before it was parked that police hope to find the man who wanted so
badly last night to leave a body count in times square
the tv news report continues playing in the bg
bradley is moving as fast down a hallway
coming towards him like a shark from the other end of the hallway maya
bradley looks determined not to deal with her right now and lowers his head but she spreads her arms slightly and basically blocks his passage through the hallway i really
need to talk to you about beefing up our surveillance operation on the caller
we dont have a surveillance operation on the caller
turning to maya someone just tried to blow up times square and youre talking to me about some facilitator who some detainee seven years ago said might have been working
with al qaeda
maya is practically shaking with zealous rage at her inability to bend bradley to her will
hes the key to bin laden
i dont fucking care about bin laden
i care about the next attack
youre going to start working on american al qaeda cells
protect the homeland
bin laden is the one who keeps telling them to attack the homeland
if it wasnt for him al qaeda would still be focused on overseas targets
if you really want to protect the homeland you need to get bin laden
this guy never met bin laden
this guy is a free lancer working off the fucking internet
no one has even talked to bin laden in four years hes out of the game he may well even be dead but you know what youre doing
youre chasing a ghost while the whole fucking network grows all around you
for a moment she is silenced by bradleys reprimand but then mayas obsession speaks for her and like a woman possessed she recklessly goes at him you just want me
to nail some low level mullah crack a dulla so that you can check that box on your resume that says while you were in pakistan you got a real terrorist
but the truth is you dont understand pakistan and you dont know al qaeda
either give me the team i need to follow this lead or the other thing youre gonna have on your resume is being the first station chief to be called
before a congressional committee for subverting the efforts to capture or kill bin laden
youre fucking out of your mind
i need four techs in a safe house in rawalpindi and four techs in a safe house in peshawar
either send them out or send me back to dc and explain to the director why you did it
maya despondent sits at the bar drinking a beer
fuck the mom we got the man himself
jack puts a cell phone down on the counter
yesterday your caller bought himself a cell phone
and every time his phone rings he taps the cell this phone will ring
did i hook you up
maya throws her arms around him
i love you
larry drives his team around the narrow streets of rawalpindi
in the backseat the computer tech studies his laptop like tracking device
my guess is that he lives close to where hes making the calls and it makes sense hed be living in rawalpindi because theres an al jezerra office there
we focus on a map of pakistan on the wall
maya is indicating neighborhoods in rawalpindi
shes briefing bradley hakim larry and a few other people
it would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if hes sending either from bin laden or from an intermediary
when he wants to make a call he leaves the house walks a few blocks then switches on the phone
we need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him
larry is at the wheel moving slowly through a dangerous part of town
the streets narrow
two motorcycles suddenly pull around in front of larrys van and stop
the riders pull out guns
we got a shooter
larry tries reversing but a compact car wheels in right behind them and larry slams on the brakes
the tech raises an m
let me talk to them
hakim gets out of the car and walks toward the men
we cant hear what theyre saying
at last hakim comes back to the car
they said white faces dont belong here
if they dont move shoot them
a tense beat while the men stare then finally leave
on a large wall map maya circles peshawar in red
larrys suv speeds onto a highway weaving in and out of dense traffic
in the backseat the computer tech is getting tossed around trying to hang onto the geo locating device in his lap
the geo locator starts to beep a blinking red light
hes east of us
try the market
the congestion thickens
they slow to a crawl
the suv stuck in traffic
larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market its packed
all men most with traditional beards worn by al qaeda members many talking on cell phones
impossible to tell who is who
impossible to find this needle in a haystack
the search continues
hakim prowls a back alley
then goes up on a rooftop to survey the activity below
hakim is on a street corner conducting surveillance
we follow him into a crowd and then lose sight
we find him again another street another fruitless search
as hakim goes from street to street we hear we got a signal on tipu road for ten minutes
then he went to umar road for five minutes
thats in the umar road area
in rawalpindi haider road roomi road
he went to the convoy road which is near the hospital
so thats haider roomi road said no gaza taimur
he made a call from haifa street thats the spice district
jack and maya click through the tracking maps on her computer screen
lahore street which is also in pesh thirty minutes
wazir bag road five
phandu road five minutes the grand trunk road forty five seconds
theres no pattern
sometimes he calls every two weeks sometimes every three theres no consistency i cant predict when hes gonna make another call because the guys erratic
do you think its intentional
it might be
maybe it just looks erratic to us
i just cant tell
wearing a black burkha maya walks into her house and sinks into the couch
she pulls off the head covering but doesnt bother to remove the burkha
she switches on the tv
if you didnt know her better youd think shed gone native
find maya driving up to a check point mobbed with protesters carrying signs joseph bradley is a cia spy
kill the spy
bradley is cia etc
meanwhile our chief foreign correspondent richard engel confirms the cias top spy in pakistan has been pulled out of there
the protesters have blocked the embassy check point
its going to take a long time to get through
hes been receiving death threats after being named publicly in a lawsuit by the family of a victim of a u
several protesters notice her they move to her car and start banging on it
maya and bradley and several other staffers watch the protest through a window the crowd grows larger and more unruly
isi fucked you
im so sorry joseph
its the first time shes addressed him by his first name
startling to hear kindness in her voice
joseph turns to reply then thinks better of it and walks away
larrys minivan chugs through the crowded markets
still on tower three
signal getting stronger
larry continues driving straight down the main road
signals getting weaker
we lost him no signal
the van passes horse drawn carts men on cell phones fruit stands
the tech studies his screen
hes up at five again
weaker now hes shifted
were back to five
i dont get it
hes driving in circles
larry now drives very fast back to the main road
and now larry stops in the middle of the market
lets hope he comes back around
fifty were within ten meters of him
larry scans the street sees a half dozen guys on cell phones
hes really close
look at the cars
hes in a vehicle
larry spots something the guy with the phone in the white they snap a photograph of a white potahar suv
is that him
you got him
i got him
im breaking off the grey minivan pulls away
larrys photograph of the white potahar suv plops on mayas desk
is this what i think it is
the guy youve been looking for geo located on his cell phone in his white car
if youre right the whole worlds gonna want in on this so you gotta stick to your guns now
the new chief of station tim alexander barely looks up from his desk as maya enters
im amazed that youre still here
looks at his watch when can we grab lunch
he sees that maya who hovers annoyingly over his desk isnt gonna wait
i need a picket line along the gt highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit
maya i know so you agree with me now
this is important
no ive just learned from my predecessor that life is better when i dont disagree with you
a two lane highway
tucked on the side of the road is an old man with a cart of mangoes
our current hypothesis is that he lives somewhere along the highway in one of the towns or a medium sized city called abbottabod or up near kashmir
ecu mango cart
nestled among the fruit is a black radio
squatting in the dirt near a bus stop is another old man watching passengers disembark from a bus
kashmir is interesting because its a way station for the tribals
we stay with the old man for a while
at last the white potahar suv drives past
he makes a note in his pad
a nut seller another cia look out scoops a handful of nuts into a bag for a customer as he keeps an eye on cars exiting the highway
he takes note as the white potahar passes him
abbottabod is interesting because we know from detainee reporting that faraj stayed there briefly in
the street is filled with compact cars
the good news is hes driving a white suv
suvs are actually pretty rare in pakistan
if he was driving a sedan or a compact wed be fucked
obviously this assumes he doesnt change vehicles
maya at her desk working and we realize that she has been typing all this in a cable she will email to washington
the building guard sees maya heading out to her car
good morning amad
maya gets in her car
the gate opens
as she starts pulling out onto the street suddenly a car drives up in front of her and three shooters come out and hammer mayas toyota
bullets spider webbing the glass as maya slams the car into reverse mayas guard starts returning fire but his aim is terrible
shooters bear down on maya pumping bullets into her armored car
the gate closes saving her at the last possible moment
maya shakes inside her vehicle
any american in pakistan is a target they dont necessarily know im cia
youre on a list
next time there might not be bulletproof glass to save you
and you of all people should know that once you are on their list you never get off
well keep up on the surveillance as best we can
hakim paces on a street as the potahar weve been following drives past him
hakim watches the vehicle enter a gated the langley predator bay is an impressive sight a command center bristling with high tech equipment
the room is filled with technicians
george is in the center where he belongs directing traffic
people come up and give him new pieces of information
the big screen displays a single image the overhead satellite image of the compound in abbottabod
from the back of the room maya enters and watches the activity unfold without her
without her input
george notices her gives a thumbs up and then turns back to his troops
steve early s a senior manager and one of georges top deputies joins maya
basically we had a guy who rolled with al qaeda and did services for them
we lost him for seven years and now we found him again and boy does he have a really nice house
is that it
okay lets go talk to the boss
maya and steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled conference room
a detailed table top model of the compound sits in the center of the conference table right next to a poster sized satellite image of the compound
she starts to sit in one of the chairs
you should sit back there
steve points her to the back of the room
theyre gonna ask if bin laden is at the end of this rainbow is the pak military with him
the question isnt are the paks protecting bin laden
the question is would he allow himself to be protected by the paks
i mean why would he trust them
he tried to kill musharaf
steve considers a reply but the meeting principals are filing in including daniel and when steve sees the cia director enter the room he clears the head of the table
if you take a right out of islamabad and drive about forty five minutes north youll find yourself here in abbottabad
a middle class community some ex military not particularly interesting to us
except we did find this compound which is unique
we got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter the windows are blacked out
its a fortress
cant you put a camera somewhere in the trees to get a look into the main house
it will probably be discovered
we have to get a look into the house
the director moves to the satellite image
alright whats this
this cluster of buildings down here
the pma the pakistan military academy
its their west point
and how close is that to the house
about a mile
a womans voice from the back of the room
its closer to eight tenths of a mile
who are you
im the motherfucker that found this place sir
the boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the model
i want to know more about whos inside this house by the end of the week
the brass files out leaving steve and maya
maya sits at her desk frustrated then walks down the aisle of cubicles to the glass wall of georges office
she grabs a red marker
through the glass morning george
in red magic marker maya writes the number on the glass
then circles it
george looks up
twenty one days
its been twenty one days since we found the house and nothings happened
we see a drone fed overhead image of the bin laden house in real time with a resolution of feet
maya stares at the screen trying to decipher the shapes moving beneath her thousands of miles away
the blips move in increments shadows lengthen
ecu maya erases the on georges wall and replaces it with
george looks away
maya sits at her desk
her phone rings
steve stares at drone image of the compound which is under the joystick control of an imagery technician
swing by i want to show you something
maya jumps up from her desk
maya walks in
steve shows her images on the large monitor
this is from a few minutes ago
weve got two males two females and seven kids
maya points to one of the shapes in the courtyard
im saying thats bushra
the brothers wife
how do you know the gender
points on screen to a thin line this is a clothes line here for laundry
men dont mess with the wash
we watch that shape move away from the clothes line and back to the house
it takes her about four seconds to move from there to the front door
so shes on the older side
whats that up there
pointing to the other those are kids
theyre shuffling around sword fighting or something with sticks
you can see their height relative to this these are cows so theyre probably between seven and nine
another figure comes out of the house and moves to the clothes line and grabs some laundry
your female is moving fast
thats what i wanted to show you
to the imagery can we pause this please
thats not the same lady
so you found two males three females
maya suddenly gets it
youre missing a male
yes we are
george is on one side of a conference table on the other side is the deputy national security advisor the special assistant to the deputy national security advisor and the
if there are three females there ought to be three males
observant muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands
we think theres a third family living in the house
so this third male that youve identified as possibly being bin laden do i just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him
hope is not a targeting layer
you give up your hope right now
we scanned for heat signatures but we cant validate if its a man or a woman up there
we found a safe house but we cant get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall
a doctor comes to the compound offering immunizations
one of the women lets him in and he offers polio vaccines to the children
we talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but theres a high risk of discovery
we have explored the possibility of digging tunnels of sending hot air balloons of re routing supply c s to take a peek but that might be too alerting
weve looked for ways of collecting available dna from his trash you know looking for his toothbrush but they burn the trash
we started a vaccination program we sent a doctor to the house to see if he could pull blood
a lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away
that didnt work out
we thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter
what was wrong with that exactly
he looks up
what was wrong with that
the sample would be too diluted
and its asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone
they dont make telephone calls from the compound
we pulled the cell tower nearby
and im also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white suv and drive around a bit and we could see him
dont they get groceries
the unidentified third male does not get groceries
he does not leave the compound
he does not present himself for photographs
when he needs fresh air he paces around beneath a grape arbor but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views
this is a professional attempt to avoid detection real tradecraft
the only people weve seen behave this way are other top level al qaeda operatives
the national security advisor nods to his special assistant who slides a big folder across his desk to george
we did a red team on your analysis
according to them this behavior could belong to someone other than al qaeda
they did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior al qaeda operative
but they also said theres a thirty five percent chance hes a saudi drug reading from the a fifteen percent chance that hes a kuwaiti arms smuggler a ten percent
chance that hes one of the relatives of the brothers
basically we agree with you the house screams security it screams someone who wants privacy it even screams bad guy but it does not scream bin laden
you get the point
if you cant prove its bin laden at least prove its not somebody else like a drug dealer
the meeting is adjourned
as they walk out
you know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program
who the hell am i supposed to ask
some guy in gitmo who is all lawyered up
hell just tell his lawyer to warn bin laden
youll think of something
maya is back at georges office keeping track of time for us by writing each passing day on the window of georges office
we watch as she erases the numbers in red and writes new ones
she underscores the numerals in thick magic marker
the same group around the same conference table
hed be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs
he has no internet access to the house
he makes no phone calls either in or out
whos he selling to whos he buying from hows he making his money
and if youre going to say hes retired id say wheres his swimming pool wheres the gold cage with the falcons
and why does he send his courier to the two cities in pakistan we most associate with al qaeda that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production
the national security advisor taps his pencil impatiently
the president is a thoughtful analytical guy
he needs proof
the national security advisor and his team file out
i have to admit i just dont get the rhythms of politics
you think this is political
if this was political wed be having this conversation in october when theres an election bump
this is pure risk
based on deductive reasoning inference supposition and the only human reporting you have is six years old from detainees who are questioned under duress
the political move here is to tell you to go fuck yourself and remind you that i was in the room when your old boss pitched wmd iraq
at least there you guys brought photographs
you know youre right i agree with everything you just said
what i meant was a man in your position how do you evaluate the risk of not doing something the risk of potentially letting bin laden slip through your fingers
george shakes his head with an aww shucks kind of shake
that is a fascinating question
george walks away
after a beat the national security advisor calls after him
george turns around
the national security advisor approaches him
lowering his voice im not saying were gonna do it
but the president wants to know if we were going to act how would we do it
give us options
doors of a hangar open in front of a large crowd that includes several white house guys a general and a squadron of navy seals including patrick justin jared saber
two soar pilots and some members of the af pak department george daniel hakim and of course maya
the doors grind open to reveal two stealth blackhawks i actually tried to kill this program a couple of times
theyve gone through an initial round of testing and they have excellent radar defeat we just havent tested them with people in them yet
the general continues his briefing
youll notice these stealth panels similar to what we use on the b pointing to the rotors the rotors have been muffled with decibel killers its slower than a blackhawk
and lacks the offense
but it can hide
can i ask a question
what do we need this for in libya
gaddafis anti air is virtually non existent
maya looks over not sure what to say
gentlemen can i have your attention
my name is george
i run the af pak division at ctc and im primary on this for the agency
this is a title fifty operation
some of us have worked together before
this is a good one
maya do you want to brief them
maya looks at the seals
folds her arms
this isnt going to be easy
there are two narratives about the location of osama bin laden
this registers on the seals
the one that youre most familiar with is that ubl is hiding in a cave in the tribal areas that hes surrounded by a large contingent of loyal fighters
but that narrative is pre understanding of ubl
the second narrative is that hes living in a city living in a city with multiple points of egress and entries and with access to communications so that he can
keep in touch with the organization
you cant run a global network of inter connected cells from a cave
weve located an individual we believe based on detainee reporting is bin ladens courier
hes living in a house in abbottabod pakistan
and we assess that one of the other occupants of the house is ubl
you got an intel source on the ground
okay so how do you know its bin laden
weve been on this op before you know
bin laden uses a courier to interact with the outside world
by locating the courier weve located bin laden
thats really the intel
quite frankly i didnt even want to use you guys with your dip and your velcro and all your gear bullshit
i wanted to drop a bomb but people didnt believe in this lead enough to drop a bomb so theyre using you guys as canaries on the theory that if
bin laden isnt there you can sneak away and no one will be the wiser
but bin laden is there and youre going to kill him for me
bullets are cheap
george is shaking his head as he talks to wolf
they are nervous downtown
i dont think well get approval this decision cycle
they look up and notice that maya is standing outside georges office staring at them through the glass
she angrily wipes the number off the window and changes it to
its her against the world
george is pulling his tray away from the food service court when maya ambushes him
weve spun up the seals weve done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound and the collection is not going to get any better
we have to keep working it
youre going to come into work one day and theres going to be a black moving van and a for sale sign in front of that compound
george drops his tray down
maya you didnt prove it
sitting around the table are the cia director jeremy wolf the deputy director george daniel steve and a few other people we dont know
at the far end of the table are back benchers including maya
im about to go look the president in the eye and what id like to know no fucking bullshit is where everyone stands on this thing
now very simply
is he there or is he not fucking there
he looks to the deputy director
we all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences
i remember iraq wmd very clearly i fronted that and i can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case
yes or no
we dont deal in certainty we deal in probability
id say theres a sixty percent probability hes there
the cia director points to wolf
im at eighty percent
their opsec is what convinces me
you guys ever agree on anything
well i agree with sixty were basing this mostly on detainee reporting and i spent a bunch of time in those rooms who knows
maya shoots daniel a look
what a traitor
id say its a soft sixty sir
im virtually certain theres some high value target there im just not sure its bin laden
the cia director leans back in his chair
this is a cluster fuck isnt it
id like to know what maya thinks
were all incorporating her assessment into ours
maya cant take it anymore one hundred percent hes there okay fine ninety five percent because i know certainty freaks you guys out but its a hundred
the cia director walks with jeremy towards the elevator
theyre all cowed
what do you think of the girl
i think shes fucking smart
as the door closes
were all smart jeremy
maya is eating lunch by herself when shes startled to see the cia director standing by her table
may i join you
she nods gulps
how long have you worked for the twelve years
i was recruited out of high school
do you know why we did that
i dont think i can answer that question sir
i dont think im allowed to answer
what else have you done for us besides bin laden
ive done nothing else
he evaluates her
weighing her certainty against his decades of washington experience
well you certainly have a flare for it
jalalabad airfield nestled against the rugged mountains of the pakistan border
everything in motion soldiers contractors aviation assets patrols coming and going
patrick and justin are playing horseshoes
maya happy for the first time since weve met her watches them so patrick be honest with me
you really believe this story
what part convinced you
patrick motions to maya
maya smiles laughs
thats the kind of concrete data point im looking for
he shakes his head
if her confidence is the one thing thats keeping me from getting ass raped in a pakistani prison
i dont know
im gonna be honest with you though i guess im cool with it
they bump fists laughing
mayas cell phone rings
she moves aside to answer it
we intercut with george in his langley office
maya i wanted you to hear it first
you know that thing we talked about
its going to happen
she hangs up turns back to the seals who are still playing horseshoes with the grace of young guys in their prime
their lives are in her hands
the small space is filled with personnel and telecommunications gear
at the back of the room maya sits quietly adjusting a headset and speaking calmly into a secure line
from the corner hakim watches her
testing testing a seal with his com set on gives her the thumbs up
she looks around at all the impressive technology in the makeshift command center
she walks over to hakim and they leave together
thank you for coming with me
ill go with you where ever you want
a few hundred feet in front of them they can see seals preparing their gear
fuck hakim what if im wrong
i wish we could have just dropped a bomb
please dont drop it while were in the house
dont drop anything while im inside
off her anxious smile blinding white lights rigged to chain link fencing like a space shuttle launch silhouetted shapes behind the lights and the thump thump thump sound of high
dollar helicopters now push through the glare and the fence into a top secret lz
where twenty two seals in full battle rattle and an attack dog load into two stealth blackhawk helicopters moving fast wordlessly loading weapons and gear under the intense bright white
light then doors slam engines whine fifty yards away maya stands alone looking on
and the helos rise above the lights and disappear into the night
hands feather the controls as the pilot one the famed nightstalkers from the special operations aviation regiment soar th flies without lights using only his nods for night vision
flying in formation barely visible in the moonless sky no flying lights
the helos near the tora bora mountain range dimly visible bulks rising in front of the helos
the seals gently bounce inside the bellies of the churning beasts
thirty seconds to first turn
hey justin what are you listening to
you should listen to it
i got plans for after this
i want to talk to you guys about it
its not selling
you become a representative
the stealths take a sharp turn
skimming the mountain
who heres been in a helo crash before
everyone raises their hands
okay so were all good
technicians track the helos on an array of computer screens
now entering pakistan
maya is here too working
shes always working
pakistani coms no chatter
find the helicopters navigating tight mountain passes
note throughout the flying sequence that follows the helicopters fly very close to the ground with a margin of error less then twenty feet
the terrain zooms by as we travel through a twisty mountain looming straight ahead on a collision course is a giant mountain
they zoom closer
we can see individual rocks now big left
seconds before impact the helicopters bank into a hard left turn
dust blows off the mountain
the dog pants sitting in its handlers lap in the dim cabin ten minutes
three mikes to target
standby for doors open
inside the dim interior illuminated by only blinking instrumentation the men are tense quiet
we pass slowly from face to face noting each seals contemplation of the mission that lies ahead
some of them are anonymous soldiers
many weve come to know justin joyfully bobbing his head grooving to his ipod
sabers eyes fixed on a thousand yard stare
hakim struggles to get comfortable and control his anxiety wipes away sweat
patrick checks his gear for the hundredth time
just a thump thump thump
and then we see them flying in tight formation the oddly rectangular helos with their black stealth panels and sharp edges like two alien spaceships advancing
should be coming up just off our nose oclock
everyone grabs onto their gear getting ready to fast rope
patrick flings open the side door
night wind rushes in small cottages mixed in with larger suburban homes
among them swimming pools
the water shimmering
then rows of green fields
a stand of trees
it appears ac
it is massive six or seven times larger than any other nearby structure with sixteen foot high walls and a gated interior
patrick leans out for a visual as the wind rips his face the helos circle the compound kicking up dust and begin to descend
cross cutting all that follows at thirty feet above the ground the helicopter begins to shudder and lose stability
instead of descending in a straight path the bird drifts sideways shouting to pilot hey
then lurches down falling to within feet of the swirling ground rotors churning the dust creating near brownout conditions a dust hurricane cu pilot finessing the controls not good enough
ecu rear rotor blades edging closer to the wall inch by inch
engines straining loudly in the thin hot air the bird loses control spins to a hard landing ecu pilot thrusts stick tail crashes hard on the wall in a awful
screech of twisting metal and sheared concrete
tossing the men inside the helo around like rag dolls
the command tent watches the helicopter crash
prince is down
blackhawk down in the animal pen
maya stands crestfallen
the dust settles to reveal
a twisted wreck
prince has crash landed into a precarious position with the back half of the helicopter wedged into the top of the wall and the front of it in the ground
leaving the passengers inside suspended more then ten feet off the ground
although hes wearing a heavy pack and carrying gear patrick jumps down landing with a knee shattering combat roll
several seals follow him
patrick pulls out of his roll and turns around to face the house looming ominously ahead of him
this mission is still a go
off mayas relief the second helo passes over but a storm of debris and garbage from the rooftop creates another flight risk and the helo banks away
patrick justin and six other seals cluster near the first gate in the animal pen
one of the seals places a charge on the gate while others check the prayer room
the charge partially blows open the metal swing doors of the gate leaving a very narrow gap
the seals muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening in the jagged metal as the sniper climbs up on the roof of the prayer room
patrick and jared arrive at the guest house but cant see inside the windows and doors are covered with sheets
patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle when the door erupts with gunfire bullets fly out of the wooden door
one skims patricks shoulder as he kneels lower
patrick fires back at the house putting a dozen rounds inside
a moment passes
they wait for a response
the door handle unlocks
abu ahmeds wife appears at the doorway and walks out
ir fah ee dek
you killed him
the seals peer inside and see abu ahmed lying dead in a pool of blood
patrick and jared pump safety rounds into the body
four kids are cowering in the corner
jared moves them out of the house
the rest of the p seals breach a gate to the courtyard of the main house
the gate flies open in a fiery ball
seals jump out of p rush to the outer wall and set breaching charges on a gate
while hakim the dog handler and another seal peel off down the block saber and his team stand by as boom
the gate charges go off
only to reveal a brick wall behind the gate
thats not a door
they hustle to the next entry way and prepare another breach the commanding officer hears that the seals outside are preparing a charge
seal mike radios in this is echo were going to breach the main gate
im internal ill let you in
the commanding officer opens the gate and the other seals walk inside
as a group they move towards the main house arriving at the south side front door
the door is open and they enter piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights the seals advance slowly into the first floor hallway
piles of household clutter stacked high in bizarre shapes greet them like the innards of a haunted house
one of the seals catches movement a figure with an ak scrambling through clutter then disappearing around a corner
the figure abu ahmeds brother abrar re appears at the end of the hallway
he pokes his head out
and is shot by justin
he falls out of view whimpering in pain
justin walks quickly to abrar
abrar is down bleeding
justin fires another round into abrar as abrars wife comes flying in from the sleeping quarters and shields him with her body
justin shoots her
abrar is underneath her he is still breathing gasping and justin shoots him again silencing him then looks to his wife and assesses her condition badly wounded faint breathing life
fading from her eyes
justin turns away justin and a breacher proceed down the hall to the heavy gate that blocks access to the stairway while another seal stays behind
somewhere children are screaming
shut those fucking kids up
the kids quiet down
talk to me
theres no fucking way we want to blow this thing
the gate is solid
this is echo were at our primary set point prepping to breach
wait echo were internal on the south side this is a negative breach
were ready to make our entry out here
roger that were coming to meet you
to the breacher stay with these kids
dont let them in the back room
in the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house justin and patrick find themselves side by side and the old friends take a moment to reconnect while
the rest of the team places charges and prepares for the next phase of the assault
were we supposed to crash that helo
patrick allows himself a smile
ibrahim tried to shoot me through the door
i popped him from the outside
i fucking smoked abrar and his wife
alt i think she was still alive
shes gonna bleed out
what a fuckin mess the door blows and they keep moving
the seals reach the staircase which is sealed off by a separate metal gate than the one inside the hallway
a charge is prepared
justin who is now inside one of the side rooms sees jared standing close to the door
hey man move
jared moves just as boooom
the door flies like a missile right into where jared had been standing
saber goes up the staircase patrick following closely behind him climbing up to see a man ducks out of sight
saber calls to him
saber waits with his carbine raised
anxiety crosses his face
hes vulnerable here an easy target if khaled were to come out blasting
khaled hears his name being called from below
a few feet away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded ak
he goes to the gun and picks it up
he hears his name again khaled
and the voice sounds friendly urgent
perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully khaled puts the gun down resting it against a wall and turns and heads back to the sound of his name
saber sees khaled poke his head around the corner of the stairway and fires killing him instantly
saber pushes past the body patrick following and they climb the staircase leading to the third floor
the neighborhood awakened by the crash and gunfire stirs to life
hakim and the seals notice lights flipping on
and down the block a group of several young men appear on a roof
raising his weapon this is echo ive got unknowns gathering on the southwest rooftops
hakim move those guys back
speaking in pashto go back brothers this is official government business and there is nothing to see here
im going to start wasting them
they will kill you
the onlookers pause
seal aiming lasers dance across their chests
they will kill you
they turn and go
seals clear the second floor as women and children flow into the hallway
a seal grabs one of the wives and pulls her out into the hallway while another female disappears behind a large refrigerator and he grabs her too
justin opens a file cabinet stuffed with documents
saber is climbing the stairs gun up towards the third floor when he sees a flash of movement across the landing above him
he stops climbing and osama
sweat on sabers face osama
a man appears at the end of the third floor hallway
a bullet strikes him in the head knocking him back into a bedroom saber fires again missing and proceeds down the hallway going full speed now patrick right behind him
sprinting into the bedroom two women stand at the entrance of the room
saber rushes them and with a football tackle slams them into the wall
patrick enters the room and fires several rounds into the man on the floor
the women saber is restraining are wailing struggling to get to their husband as a ten year old boy rushes up to the body
patrick pushes him away and kneels down to get a better look at the body
dude do you realize what you just did
jared questions the wives
who is he
he is al noori hasan
shouting back to she says its not him
talk to a kid
jared kneels down next to a nine year old girl huddled in the corner and snaps open a chem light
he gives her the glowing green wand
daughter what is his name
the girl makes no reply
through the radio for god and country geronimo
the commanding officer issues orders
all stations target secure target secure
target secure commence sse
justin flicks on the lights
moving fast he picks up a computer tower and throws it to the floor cracking it open rips out the hard drive and tosses that into the bag
as we pull back and realize the enormity of the task in front of him the lights show an organized office crammed with information stacks of files disks video equipment
twenty years of jihad
to his team do not leave a hard drive
the seals gather everything they can
saber walks down the staircase in a daze
we stay with him as he descends noting the faraway look in his eyes saber walks into the office where the sse sensitive sight exploitation is underway
i shot the third floor guy
good for you
you want to help
justin tosses him an sse bag
the command team studies their monitors
the commanding officer is talking on two radios at once one to his men the other to brass back at jalalabad base
echo this is red how long do you need for sse
at least ten minutes
you have four
this is a gold mine i need more time than that
if youre not at the lz in four im going to leave your ass behind
justin yells to his team
hakim arrives at the crashed helo
he crawls into the interior and finds a black body bag
we follow this bag hakim jogs into the main house with the body bag and through his pov we see slow down for the first time since the raid began
noting the destruction blood stains on the walls bodies pierced with bullets wailing children
where do you need the bag
seals roll the body into the bag as patrick and another seal collect articles of interest
two seals zip up the bag and carry it out
justins team leaves the office
the body bag is laid in the courtyard
the eod seal slides into the belly of prince
while he places charges another seal climbs up to affix charges to the roof and rotors
and like a tight roper he walks out on the tail of the helicopter when suddenly his foot slips piercing the tails thin skin and he nearly falls off
he manages to place a last charge but the remainder of the tail piece will not be detonated
back at the whirling helicopter the seals shove the body bag into the interior compartment and jump in after it
the helo rises into the night
prince explodes sending shrapnel and a fireball high into the air the seals watch the flames as the compound shrinks beneath the fire of the exploded crashed helo blazes in
the seals sit silent in the cabin body bag at their feet
bathed in the bright white lights maya waits for the helo
concern on her face
at last she hears it
a moment later prince hovers into view and lands
patrick and several seals run out carrying the bag
the place is swarming with soldiers seals and fbi agents with large bio metric scanners loud shouting everywhere mark media first floor who has a pen etc
maya makes her way towards the hangar tent
she pushes through the busy seals
maya sees it now way in the corner of the hangar
she walks and walks towards the bag
she is alone with it now
she unzips the bag cu maya
seven years telescoping to this moment
the end of a journey
she stares at the body for a moment then turns to look across the room where admiral mcraven meets her eye
sir the agency expert gave a visual confirmation
yes sir the girl
maya gazes at the bloodied face then turns away and zips the bag
and leaves the tent
her eyes afire
maya waits on the tarmac alone
a c one of the largest most impressive planes in the american fleet rolls to a stop and the hatch opens
she climbs the ladder the cavernous cargo plane is empty of passengers
the pilot motions to the seats
are you maya
thats the only name they gave me
you can sit wherever you want youre the only one on the manifest
maya sits down buckles in
the pilot heads back to the you must be pretty important you got the whole plane to yourself
where do you want to go
finally she lets go
those luminous eyes become pools of relief and pain
