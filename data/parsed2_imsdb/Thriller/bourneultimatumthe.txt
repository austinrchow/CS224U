motion flat out its us were running stumbling breathing rushed blood in the snow
we are jason bourne and were running down an alley
supered below moscow blue lights from the distance strobing through the night rushing toward us police cars three of them sirens howling as they bear down closer faster until they
whip past the alley
up against the wall bourne is hidden in the shadows
bourne is badly wounded shot through the shoulder bruises and broken bones from the final car chase in with a groan he lifts himself up staggers across a park toward
rows of medicine and first aid supplies and in the background a door being jimmied
the alarm goes off
vicodin as bourne grabs it
then surgical supplies scalpel
bourne finds a large sink
rests his gun there
lays out surgical supplies
checks out his back in the mirror
opens the capsules of penicillin and pours the powder directly into the wound
begins treating himself
a police car pulls up to the curb lights flashing
one policeman goes to the jimmied door
second policeman sees blood and footprints
he motions to his partner to follow
bourne finishing up splashes water on his face he seems a man on a mission
he looks up his face
written on a building
welcome to the program
pov bourne walks down a corridor corridor
the cops approaching
daniels leading bourne down the corridor
youll be saving american lives
a black sack is thrown over bournes head then stock a torrent of quick shots of bournes kills the professor jarda the blonde guy in paris mr
bang marie hit in the head
the car off the bridge
she sinks away dead
the police enter the back room guns drawn
put your hands on your head and turn around slowly
bourne snaps out of it doesnt move
policeman older approaches him
when bourne doesnt respond to his questions the policeman starts forward
bourne turns and in one motion grabs his gun from the sink and disables the bourne freezes policeman with his gun and a look
in russian give me your gun and radio
policeman s gun and radio skittle across the floor
in russian my argument is not with you
bourne smashes the radio and takes the gun
a title fades in super six weeks later establishing shot cia headquarters a workman installs a nameplate that reads ezra kramer director cia
kramer listens to a recording with landy and cronin
there are unhung pictures and a few other items that indicate he has just moved into this job
two other senior cia officials sit in on the meeting
kramer looks at a file on bourne and abbott
so we got in the way
is that why neski died
is that why you killed marie
kramer glances at a photo of marie in the file
you killed marie the minute you climbed into her car
the minute you entered her life she was dead
kramer looks at abbotts official photo
i told you people to leave me alone
i fell off the grid
i was half way around the world
theres no place it wont catch up to you
its how every story ends
its what you are jason
you always will be
we think thats bourne hitting him on the head and then he makes a gun with his hand i
bourne putting his gun to abbotts head
she wouldnt want me to
thats the only reason your alive
the tape clicks off
cronin puts a picture of marie in front of kramer
his girlfriend marie
she was killed in india three weeks ago
kramer looks down at another image
abbott dead after his suicide
a dirty section chief in league with a corrupt russian billionaire commits suicide when confronted by jason bourne
you couldnt make this stuff up
holds up the photo of abbot dead you watched this happen
kramer shakes his head in disgust at the whole situation
bournes last confirmed location is moscow three days ago
so what does he do now
i think hes looking for something he hasnt found
whats he after
im not sure
maybe he hasnt gotten his memory back yet
not all of it
a look from kramer
pam what i need to know is what kind of a threat is he to us
if he just wanted to hurt us he could have sent this tape to cnn
maybe he still will
maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan
i dont know
i just know my number one rule is the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst
as far as im concerned bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise
ross interviews daniels a tape recorder on the table between them
ross shows daniels some of the evidence hes assembled
wanted posters of jason bourne
with poster this ones three years ago had half of interpol after him disappeared
turned up in naples berlin moscow disappeared again
daniels says nothing the girl he was on he run with marie kreutz she turned up dead halfway around the world from a snipers bullet
beat what connects the dots
is it treadstone
turn off that tape recorder
the charm of old paris captured in the workings of an elevator operating in a wrought iron shaft
a work table covered with sheet music music paper pencils
and sitting on the upright piano against the wall a framed photo of marie
a knock on a door beautifully heavily lacquered with centuries of paint
martin kreutz late s opens the door and finds bourne
a long look between them like two lost brothers who recognize each other each has been waiting for this moment for a long time
martin looks out the window
where is my sister
she was killed
i knew it was going to end this way
it was always going to end this way
i didnt believe that
why did she die
she was shot
a man came for me
and then you killed him
someone started all this
and im going to find them
bourne looks at him for a beat and leaves
bourne climbs the stairs
bourne rounds a corner and stops sees a bodyguard at a door up the street hail a car then go back inside
bourne walks up to the door the bodyguard comes out again
bourne knocks him aside
grabs the man behind him in french who started treadstone
the bodyguard comes back gun out in french to bodyguard its ok
in french to bourne theyre still looking for you
you are taking a big risk coming here
bourne shoves him against the wall hard
in french just tell me what i want to know
in french i just provided them weapons
i dont know who started in french you know something
tell me where to start looking
in french theres a journalist in london
he seems to know a lot about you
he has a source inside the program
someone there from the beginning
what should i tell them if they contact me
in english they give me the name i want or i burn their entire house down to get it
ross hurries to catch a taxi as he talks on his cell phone
this is big a skein of lies you pull at it and it just keeps coming ill fill you in when i get home
and its not finished either
beat theyre calling it blackbriar
follow this sequence as
a listening station in england scoops up millions of cell phone calls
sifts through billions of words
one word emerges from the chatter
a technician sends the data to nsa back in the states
where another computer gathers up the rest of the phone call
as we listen
blackbriar echelon hit

and there in the cri hub another technician receives the data
stops supervisor and reports

and a sneak and peeks on their way to his apartment

marie fades into the depths dead
bourne burns maries stuff bourne comes out of the flashback
he is still carrying the pain of her loss bourne finds rosss name on the masthead then goes to the name just below it in the news department
ross crosses a busy london street heads to guardian office building
a cri team watches from a parked car

ross hails a black taxi
the silver van pulls out behind him
vosen watches as the feed from the silver van comes through
over radio we have the subject confirmed
where is he heading
bourne arrives on the eurostar
enters the station
as the taxi moves away the silver van pulls out behind it
a cycle courier momentarily blocks its path
looking in on ross sifting through documents in the back seat
stand by at waterloo
bourne moving toward the rendezvous
ross pays the driver exits
checks his watch
isnt sure what his next move is technicians searching for ross on the busy street
mobile one give us eyes on the subject
mobile one two people from the van take up a position in an open stairwell three floors up
they focus a camera down on ross
bourne buys a cell phone
activates the sim card on the new phone
dumps the pay as you go package in a bin
rounds a corner
out of sight
screens come alive with a pov of ross
vosen studies the monitors
ross arrives at waterloo pays taxi
sir subject just arrived at the south entrance to waterloo station
ross moves to the entrance
behind him inside the tube station portico bourne arrives
sees the two survey teams
mobile one up the stair well and mobile two at street level
commuters coming up the escalators
bourne joins them moving towards ross
right on him
looking out onto the street
bourne brushes past him and puts the phone in his pocket
ross feels the contact
checking himself hes okay
but now a phone is ringing looks around must be someone else
but the vibrations coming from his jacket pocket
ross takes out the phone not his puzzled
ross hits answer

ross looking around

the london bus approaching
ross begins to move

ross standing next to the hoody head down
trying to play it cool ross in clear view of the cameras

just then a bus pulling up to the bus stop blocking both surveys views
rifle mics picking up the bus chatter instead of vosen

the crackle of the survey teams as they try and reframe
pov screen survey one seeing the bus clear
the hoody has gone
pov another screen survey two camera finally catching up picking out the hoody on the bus as it begins to pull away

techs giving orders
survey two three men racing across the road on foot
weaving through heavy traffic
bourne watching his plan unfold
only a few seconds to get ross out of there

ill meet you at the newsstand
ross rearing this moving away the bus moves up to the traffic light
the agents moving across the street
vosen looking at the screens
no no look
ross is not on the bus
split up the team get the guy on the bus and send someone to stay on ross
one agent peeling off to keep ross in check
the other two agents racing to the bus as it pulls away from the lights
kicking the doors open leaping on

pushing the hoody to the floor
driver stop the bus
on the hoody
the hood is pulled back
an innocent young man terrified bewildered
ross on the move across the walkway
survey one moving up the steps only to meet bourne coming down
three quick moves and hes down slumped against a wall just another drunk to step over in the rush hour
pulls the feed
takes the earbud
then back up and falls into step behind ross
listening in to the chaos he has caused an ocean away
techies scrambling to restore the feed
weve lost signal
what happened to survey one
i dont like this
patch me through to met surveillance
paz parked up gets the call pulls out into the traffic
slicing through to the target area
waterloo up ahead
a second survey team out of their vehicles
furtively they lock and load their side arms
fanning out towards the station
bourne stops ross surprising him
why do you know so much about me
you talked to someone from treadstone
someone there at the beginning
whats his name
i cant tell you that
whos following me
whoever they are its trouble
are they blackbriar
blackbriar whats blackbriar
i dont know
i heard the name this morning for the first time
whatever it is my source said it started with you
what are you talking about
look just help me get away from these people
and we can talk more
we can spotting approaching operatives we have to move
bourne moves ross toward the concourse
answer your phone
screens coming alive again
they are through to met surveillance the area around waterloo
last sighted heading to the west entrance
hes got to be close
seal the entrances
the new survey team moves towards different entrances ready to beat out the quarry
cameras suddenly alive
movement across the footbridge
the nets been thrown
into the station concourse
ross moving fast
fighting through the crowds of faces
each one a killer in ross tormented mind
bourne on the periphery looking out across the throng picking out the inconsistencies
one agent then another approaching
blonde black top
has she seen me
dip left past the photo kiosk
ross spinning round
black top passing in the background missing him
bourne crossing close behind marshalling the pieces at breakneck speed
weaving through the commuters
bourne seeing cameras turn
ross heading into their path
change of plan
tie your shoelace
bourne seeing ross dip out of view as a group of tourists block the cctvs line of sight
that same scene scores of tourists from vosens point of view
the techs try to get another angle
ross looking through the sea of legs as he finishes tying his laces
cameras sweeping past
are we clear
ross on the move
seeing a bin man coming toward him reaching into his trolley
straight toward me
hes got a gun
keep straight ahead
but ross swerves out of his path as the bin man pulls out a bunch of keys
cctv cameras turn zooming in on ross
ross face on all screens
we got a hit
middle of the concourse
were losing him
we cannot afford to lose him
frenzied teching as they capture and transmit an image of ross to
paz flipping open his phone
a voice crackling in his earpiece
subject heading east
paz jamming the wheel hard right
doing a high speed u turn
heading towards the east side of the station
bourne realizes ross has been seen
sees the agents starting to form the box
get into cover
ross moving faster
h whats the status of the asset
h in place in one minute
alright i want to take him now
get him out of there and have the asset cover it
wills gives orders
paz pulling into a side street
out towards a series of arches that lead underneath the terminal
in his ear
target moving towards the stores
asset in play
eta thirty seconds
all exits covered
paz through the archway
grabbing a station plan
through a subterranean maze of corridors
on his way to the kill zone
ross moving through crowds around the departures board
bourne hearing that last exchange in his earpiece too
asset in play
bournes pov agents closing the box
the departures board
a train waiting
commuters waiting for the platform the front
suddenly click platform displays
a wave of commuters flooding away sweeping the agents back with them towards platform
bournes bought them thirty seconds
paz on the move
through a door
taking a left down another tunnel
opens another security door and moves up some steps
towards a ladder
the agents regrouping
speaking into their radios
voice hes in the store still moving east
ross out into the open again
in front of him another store bourne searching the concourse
something bothering him
the threat level clicking another notch
paz heads up some stairs to a service platform
climbs a ladder
ross into the store complex
to one side is a service doorway
bourne sees the agents approaching
looks the other way up at the hoardings above
somethings not right
service doorway now
an image of ross as he enters the store complex appears on the screen
three means of egress
close him down
ross through narrow store corridors
sheer panic now
two of the agents move in after him
bourne behind them
bang takes the first out silently
ross moving out to the light as another agent follows
through the store room
ross travelling through
the second agent right behind as bourne steps out from behind the store room door
the dull snap of bones as second agent falls to the floor
on a screen vosen watches transfixed as bourne takes out all his agents and then grabs robb
jesus christ thats jason bourne
maybe hes the source
it doesnt matter the asset now has targets
take them both out
wills taps in the order
paz moves cross a narrow walkway
now hes behind a mechanical tri panel hoarding
the kind that displays a different advert every seconds
he waits for the change and then a huge field of vision across the concourse stretching out down below him a snipers heaven
paz pulling open the motor casing from the side panel goes to work on it
slowing the rotation
rearranging the large triangular prisms to give him just the right time gap to pull the trigger and just enough cover to disappear
he takes out rifle parts from his rucksack
starts to assemble them
im going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what i say
fear induced autopilot sure okay
no listen to me exactly what i say this time
ross snaps to focus
looks bourne in the eye
stay here while i look for an escape
paz puts together the rifle
bourne exits from the silver door behind threshers
he stays on the phone with ross
hidden from the view of the cctv cameras by the thick crowd bourne sees the approaching agents abruptly pulling back
i can see the entrance from here i can make it out no stay behind that door
cctv view of the silver door behind threshers that ross is behind not bourne
wills is on phone
that silver door
bournes behind that door
okay pull the agents back and give bournes location to the asset
on his cell phone paz receives a text indicating bournes location
paz finds the silver door and aims his rifle at it
a shape barely visible moving behind the window
its ross but paz and the hub think its bourne
bourne spots the agents pulling back per wills orders
if i run now i can make it no
somethings not right
paz awaiting his shot the door comes open slightly but from this angle paz doesnt have a clean shot at his target who he thinks is bourne
bourne searches the rafters looking for any threats from above
im going to go for it okay
dont move until i tell you
bourne is distracted by the last of the agents disappearing
something is definitely wrong im going to go for it
no no not now
ross suddenly sprints out from behind the door paz sees the shape emerge paz fires but its ross not bourne
ross is hit by pazs shot
he falls inches from the silver door dead
blood has splattered on the door
paz snaps his head back to the scope realizing hes shot the wrong person
then he catches a glimpse of bourne bourne ducks behind the gathering crowd out of pazs line of sight and goes to the body
vosen and wills stare at the screen
at the image of ross dead on the concourse
the room normally full of chatter has gone dead silent
vosen puts his head in his hands
this is a monumental screw up and everyone here knows it
he just had the wrong man killed
then suddenly vosen snaps back to focus get the asset out of there
what about bourne
on the hub monitors we see police moving in
vosen doesnt need to see anymore
get him out of there now
bourne feels ross body for something
paz is frustrated by the order
hes itching to get another shot off at bourne but after a beat packs up quickly as ordered
back in waterloo cops run in from all sides
on the screens and in real life the aftermath of the hit
paramedics try helplessly to deal with ross killed instantly by the head shot meant for bourne
police arrive and seal off the crime scene
bourne on the move
fast past platforms
on his way up to the tri panel
on to a walkway
to his right he sees a figure disappearing
bourne hammers down the walk way in pursuit
bourne tailing paz down on to a parallel platform
paz dipping down into the underground entrance
paz moving deliberately through the evening rush hour blending in
bourne in pursuit
chasing on instinct
a glimpse of paz at the bottom of an escalator
bourne fights past people
paz disappears into the crowd
bourne rushes to catch him
rounding a corner
a long walkway at the end two staircases lead to different tube lines
bourne hesitates measures the choice
the sound of a train fills the station bourne fast downstairs
watches just as paz gets onto the car at another door
bourne lunges to get on the train
but the doors close
watching paz from the platform as he sags down onto a seat nauseated his skin clammy his head pounding
he takes out the pills and dry swallows them
as if hes looking in the mirror at his old self
the self before the bourne identity
he looks straight ahead just another commuter
watching paz as the train pulls away
then bourne is immediately in motion
we have a situation
establishing sewell and marbury
daniels watches news of ross murder on tv
daniels panics opens his safe packs up papers takes blackbriar file
bourne sits at a computer the ross notebook open in front of him
he pages through it finding names places how did this all start
he googles sewell and marbury finds paris berlin madrid
bourne continues to search and finds receipt from madrid
landy steps out of a taxi
to waiter sparkling
and a heart healthy omelet with goat cheese and peppers
handing her the menu maam
nothing for me
vosen looks at her surprised
she shakes her head no
she sits without taking her coat off
shes not staying long
when the director called it was suggested we bring you on suggested
beat are you sure it was just a suggestion
funny how different things look depending on where you sit
i look at this as doing a favor for you
giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business
it was finished the moment i realized i was chasing him for something he didnt do
the case is closed
so what do you make of this
handing her surveillance photos of bourne in paris french intel picked up bourne meeting pierre elattrache on tuesday
he threatened to burn our house down if you didnt tell him who started treadstone
thats a big problem wouldnt you agree
this doesnt feel like bourne to me
whys it so hard for you to believe
probably because its coming from you noah
lets try and be adults okay
we all thought he was done off the grid
but bournes back
maybe hes a threat
we both want the same thing here
so what happened at waterloo
we have a leak
bourne showed up in our surveillance
we had very little time to react
and the reporter ended up dead
bourne saw us coming
landy looks at him suspicious
so what was he doing
we dont know
but just the fact that he was there means hes up to something dont you think
maybe hes the source
the real question is how you managed to get in a fire fight in the middle of a public train station
dont second guess an operation from an armchair pam
its not fair
im going to the office now
ill make my own introductions
an ave train pulling into the vast station
bourne stepping out walking up the platform
moving out through the station
two new techs plus the three we met before
all watching vosen lead landy and cronin into the room
this is pamela landy
shes gonna be quarterbacking our search effort
i think what we oughta do just to get started lets go around the room say who you are and what your spec is
landy stepping in before this gets going lets do names later
shes got the floor whats bournes last fixed position
twelve hundred zulu
where are your grids coming from
you have an echelon package
why isnt it on
we were waiting
no takers youre nine hours behind the toughest target youve ever tracked
i want everyone to sit down strap in and turn on all youve got
beat that would mean now
that lights it
i want everything youve got on ross on screen one
landy watches as the screen lights up with ross information
bourne arrives begins to recon the area
he goes to the front door finds sewell and marbury and rings the bell
two cops come around a corner
bourne sees them notes the side of the building and leaves
sir we just hacked rosss email account at the guardian and found a round trip ticket to turin yesterday
i think we can be pretty certain that bournes not your source then
rosss call to his editor where he said he just met the source on blackbriar took place just after his flight landed
his met his source in turin
so what bourne met ross for breakfast and then at noon the same day bourne calls ross to demand a meet at waterloo
needling wills maybe they were even on the same flight
cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with blackbriar sci clearance against all calls in and out of turin during the morning ross was there technicians start pounding
the guy youre after is a cia operative with clearance above top secret
he was committing treason by talking to ross
do you really think while doing that he used a cell phone he knows we can track
zero results on the cross check
vosen stares daggers at her
do you have a better idea
yeah id look at all the people whose cell phones were switched off the entire period ross was in turin
do it jimmy
technicians start tapping
looks at cronin i mean if your people use their cell phones as much as mine do the list should be pretty small three names tom brewster jack boulin neal
the names display on the screen tom brewster jack boulin neal daniels
the hub employees cant help but be impressed by landy
wills and vosen notice their response
now check everything in rosss apartment against those names
look for common patterns look for initials
bring that up on main
cronin is leaning down in front of a computer screen
point to something for the tech who puts it on the big screen blown up
in a set of handwritten notes by ross it says per n
next to several scrawls
hes station chief in madrid now isnt he
call the rso at the embassy and have them take daniels into custody if hes there
if hes not get a grab team to the calle norte safe house
send them in heavy and tell them well assist with entry
daniels isnt im worried about bourne
if hes not rosss source then he must be after rosss source just like us
bourne in a taxi turning a corner into a narrow street
the rain has slowed but the streets are still quiet
bourne gets out and walks past the sewell and marbury front door picks the lock and gains entry
bourne up the stairs
finds the office
jimmies the door
disables the alarm
all the signs of a hurried exit
a half filled cup of coffee cigarette burned down in an ashtray but not snubbed out a light left on files and documents some shredded some not
vosen paces back and forth
the hub is much quieter than it was in the waterloo scenes
parque vasquez is clean
no sign of subject
team two eta callee norte
a black car moving briskly through traffic and hammond at the wheel
kiley with the map
shutting off his phone
bourne checks the office
soon he finds a photo of daniels with albert hirsch
bourne arrives at a nondescript steel door with two cctv cameras covering it
he sees written above the door
the flashback overwhelms bourne
pov shots of bourne walking down the long corridor with daniels
other shots revealing that bourne is in army dress greens without hat
daniels knocks and leads bourne into bourne is driven to his knees
bourne is dragged into a room with a large water tank
his hands have been bound behind his back the sacks drawstring pulled tight and he has been weighted down
bourne is shoved into the water
bourne falls into the water
he starts to sink
the wet sack allows us to see the outlines of his face
also povs as bourne sinks
bourne struggles wildly at first
tries to get out of his restraints
but to no avail
srd men watch him from the edge of the tank
perhaps also on monitors
bourne fights every human instinct to draw a breath
also shot from bournes pov youre going to drown
there is nothing you can do to prevent this
stop struggling and accept it
finally bourne cant hold his breath for an instant longer
his mouth opens
water rushes in
he convulses begins to drown
bournes body goes limp
srd men watch
bourne goes limp
pov of him blacking out
bourne comes out of the flashback
as he staggers across the room he notices a car arriving on the monitor
a car approaches
bourne snaps out of it and sees the car on a security monitor
agents get out of car and approach building
sir theyre at the front door
hammond and kiley enter the building
bourne runs water into the tea kettle sets the trap
hammond and kiley enter
bourne listens from his hiding spot
okay put it live
hammond moves quickly into the room gun raised
hammond at the alarm box
that has to be bourne
vosen already moving to the monitor
hammond and kiley move cautiously from room to room theyve done it before
into mike safes cleaned out
vosen pacing impatiently around the speakerphone shit
track the passports
kiley gestures to a light moving under a door
hand on the knob and pulls the closet door open nothing
a small kitchen
on the stove
a tea kettle and a spoon
which is the last thing theyll remember because
bourne coming around the corner fast full stop and bourne lays out hammond
kiley turns to find bourne who takes him out too
then it stops
bourne yanks the headsets
closes the phone
the screens go black
get a back up team in there
tea kettle payoff
how long till back up arrives
the hub scrambles to answer that
landy paces in the background
suspicious of vosen
beat loud to the entire hub stop
i have an idea
on a security monitor bourne sees another figure moving up the stairs
checking his watch reloading his gun
twisting into the path to shoot as the door opens hesitating because its nicky
a beat long unbroken
what are you doing here
i was posted here after berlin
the office phone goes
bourne waving her to it
she picks it up
he hits the speaker phone
who is this
this is nicky parsons
landy reacts to her voice
both vosen and landy strongly suspect bourne is there and listening
vosen reads her duress challenge identity check off the screen
it reads challenge sparrow response if under duress ruby response if normal everest nicky i need to do an id challenge first
code in sparrow
vosen looks at the screen to check her response
nicky this is noah vosen
how long have you been on site
i just walked in
we have two officers on site
are you in contact with them
unconscious but alive
is there any sign of daniels
nicky this is pam landy
we have reason to believe there is a connection between neal daniels and jason bourne
bourne are you still looking for bourne
i thought the case was closed
no some people are convinced hes still a threat
i disagree but to find out i need to talk to him
vosen seething because landy has interrupted him
hold on nicky
vosen hits the mute button
what are you doing
you know bournes probably listening
landy doesnt answer
vosen to wills how long till back up arrives
wills holds up three fingers
into microphone again listen nicky
i want you to stay put and secure the premises
it could be an hour until another team arrives
landy piercing vosen with a look
bourne continues to hold the gun in her face nicky is very calm considering the predicament she is in
dial tone as the line gets closed at the other end
they know youre here
how long do i have
flash two sedans squeal around a corner
minutes to safehouse
my cars outside
i know where daniels is
bourne lowers his gun grabs the phone and dials emergency operator
where is your emergency
bourne answers her in perfect spanish with a perfect madrid accent but worked up like a civilian would be
i hear gunfire
and men shouting
i think theyre americans bourne pushes the phone off the desk fires four shots into the ceiling calmly moves nicky towards the back door
you disagree hes a threat
he just took out two more of my men
not to mention his ultimatum to ellatrache
the only way this has a happy ending noah is if we find a way to bring bourne in voluntarily
he wants revenge pam
the only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat
bourne and nicky rapidly descend
okay where is daniels headed
oclock this morning he wired
to a numbered bank account in tangier
okay tangier is about miles away we can make the morning ferry
and then what
bourne and nicky exit on to the street
suddenly they hear tires squealing nearby
they continue to walk down the street towards nickys car
vosen and landy are watching this live
as they cross the street two madrid police cars come around the corner the wrong way and screech to a stop
four cops jump out and take aim at the agents
more sirens closing in
a third police car appears
then a fourth
vosen cant believe it the agents drop their guns and surrender
bourne and nicky continue around a corner they get in her vw golf and drive away
vosen stares at landy
a beat then she walks out
issue a standing kill order on jason bourne effective immediately
vosen on the phone
we lost bourne
you still think hes after daniels
nickys just the means
but if we find daniels well find bourne
daniels knows way too much
daniels knows everything
we cant let them meet
ill take care of it
beat and fill hirsch in
just in case
bourne and nicky sit over coffee
a long silence
then what are you after jason
why are you looking for daniels
do you know who this is
bourne puts the photo of daniels and hirsch on the table between them
she looks at the photo points
points at hirsch i dont know who that is
i have to get back to the beginning
or ill never be free of this
who is he
i think he started treadstone
i remember meeting him
i remember the first day
beat daniels brought me to him
nicky looks back at him
not sure what to say
quick flash bourne head in sack is held underwater struggling desperately for breath bourne comes out of the flashback
nicky is looking at him
that wasnt some one off initiation
daniels said they did that to you over and over again
thats how they
she doesnt finish
and bourne doesnt ask her to
just a long pause
why are you helping me
it was difficult for me
bourne looks up
another long pause
you really dont remember anything
two spanish cops enter the cafe
we should move
they get up and leave
vosen goes to his safe
to voiceprint mic noah vosen
then he puts his thumb into a print reader
the safe door pops open
he pulls out a file marked top secret
cronin makes his way down the hallway
landy works at her desk
they tracked daniels passport to a hotel in tangier
theyre holding up a bank transfer he made to keep him in place while they move an asset in from casablanca
this just keeps getting worse
landy enters without knocking
since when do you have authorization for lethal action against daniels
since he cleaned out a blackbriar safe and fled to morocco
so grab him i dont have the people on the ground to do that and im not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands
whats going on
whats daniels got
whats he got
he ran all of blackbriars operations in southern europe and north africa
i think the worlds well aware we have a rendition and lethal action capability at this point noah
for christs sake pam hes got our entire playbook
names dates ghost sites how we train our assets
you still dont have the authority to kill him
oh yes i do pam
vosen holds up the file we saw him pull out of his safe
it is labeled blackbriar lethal action protocol
thats what makes us special
no red tape
no more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order
landy opens up the file
sees the words instantaneous lethal action is authorized when
you just decide
no checks and balances
come on pam youve seen the raw intel
you know how real the threat is
we cant afford to have our hands tied like that anymore
bourne and nicky ride the ferry from gibraltar to morocco
they arrive and pass through customs
desh arrives grabs a taxi
bourne and nicky enter a shabby room
turn on the fluorescent lights
bourne tosses his backpack on the bed
nicky plugs her laptop into the usb port
on the screen as nicky hacks into the system
landy on the phone

the phone buzzes
kramer picks it up

nicky sits desh walks up and snatches the phone off of the table
a scooter is pulling up and the driver walks toward bourne
he brushes past him taking the key
keeping desh in sight as he returns to his vespa and pulls out in to traffic
sir the asset is on the move in route to subject
sir the asset is back on course
vosen looks up
sir we have an unauthorized breach
someone with active system knowledge has penetrated out protocols

vosen looks over at landy
his wheels turning
a series of cuts between them
where did the course deviation occur
south to rue belgique

thats where parsons is
he pauses deciding what course to take
when were finished with daniels send the asset after her
we find parsons we find bourne
going to vosen firm noah what are you doing
i want to know whats going on
im asking on what basis youre continuing this operation
on the basis that nicky parsons has compromised a covert operation
she is up to her neck in it
this is about daniels not nicky
she has betrayed us
you dont know the circumstances
shes in league with jason bourne for chrissake
you dont have the authority to kill her or bourne
yes i do pam its right here and its legal
vosen slams a document on the desk
insert shot blackbriar lethal action protocol
shes one of our own
you start down this path
where does it end
it ends when weve won
landy turns and storms out
notify the asset of the additional target
bryan codes in a kill order on nicky
as he rides his vespa desh receives additional target information
pictures of bourne and nicky
desh glances in his rearview mirror spots bourne
have the bank release the funds
a tech calls daniels
daniels answers phone
daniels bank of tangier
your funds are now available
desh parks the motorbike and walks around the corner bourne follows
daniels car coming down the street
bourne stops and sees the car realizes the danger
bourne turns back to see desh with the detonator in his hand
bourne locks eyes with desh
before bourne can react desh detonates
daniels is dead
bourne is thrown across the street by the blast
he lays desh pov
he looks back to see bourne not moving lying in the street
desh gets on his motorbike and heads off to kill nicky
nicky still at that cafe waiting
taking out her phone puzzled
no reply code in
just the noise of traffic
desh on the move towards petit socco
on the cell making that silent call
bournes too late hearing the line busy tone
knows this tactic
and those policemen are getting closer
a screen comes alive
we have a trace
target heading north
rue des chretiens
intercept eta six minutes
okay thats it
bar her cell
tie it off
desh is disappearing from view
and the policemen are surrounding bourne
demanding to see his papers
bourne speaking in spanish fishing for his papers
looking back up the street
forming a plan
checking his watch
more police arriving now
and desh has disappeared out of sight
no time for this
bourne breaks away
through the crowds into the traffic
police whistles shouting
the chase is on
three policemen turning into his path
bourne taking them down
sprinting out across the road
a kid and his moped
caught up in the police dragnet
bourne leaping on the bike kick starting it
away into traffic as two squad cars turn and make chase
bourne weaving through traffic
one hand on the bike the other on the cell desperately trying to call nicky
but now at least hes got a dial tone
nicky grabbing the cell
listen to me
you need to the line goes dead
looking at the screen service really spooked now looking around
time to move
dismantling the phone instinctively scattering its components
she starts to make her way out of the square
desh through the streets getting closer heading towards the petit socco
bourne picking up the pace
three more police cars out of a side road just missing him
bourne choosing his exit
up ahead a narrow alleyway taking it
the squad cars crunching to a halt behind him
desh crossing the square weaving through a sea of push bikes
parking his vespa at the corner of rue des chretiens
travelling on foot
nicky trying to keep calm
checking each alley
bourne arriving seeing nicky has left
seeing deshs vespa parked up
more police on foot now
bourne parking up
seeing the crowded streets
looking up to the rooftops
he needs to get higher
starts running up steps
bourne into a riad
through a courtyard up more stairs up a ladder
out onto the rooftops
scanning the skyline
has he misjudged
no there in the distance at the top of a narrow street nicky walking slowly and behind desh
bourne tailing him trying to close the gap
dipping down through another riad through an alley
up more stairs
back up onto another roof
hes gained a few metres on desh goes up to the rooftops now
bourne has him in sight desh is prepping his gun with a silencer
desh speeding up
bourne sees nicky down below amongst the crowds
in deshs sights
bourne knows he has to gain more ground
cable cam shot two trained assassins leaping across the narrow streets silently effortlessly the cops down below searching the alleyways oblivious to the chase unfolding above them
bourne nearly on terms with him then desh dipping down again into the street below
avoiding the police he melts into the crowds
steadycam shot following bourne as he heads downstairs
through a corridor then a courtyard bursting out of a door into the street a police checkpoint
right in his path
bourne forced to dog leg and take another route
bournes lost him for the moment
nicky walking fast up the rue des chretiens
wondering why there are so many police around
suddenly stopping seeing desh knows instantly that he is coming for her
now we see nickys skills
has to think on her fee t checking the alleyways
slipping out of sight
nicky looking to the rooftops taking the advantage
up some steps into a riad
desh tracking her
bourne seeing desh again further up the street
heading in that direction
nicky through one hallway then another
moving up all the time
desh arriving at the steps
looks up to where nicky is going
takes the entrance to the next building
anticipates her next move
aiming to cut her off
nicky up steps
out onto the rooftops
looking for a path across them
scrabbling across the roof of this crumbling riad
knows she cant go back down
she makes it across to the next building
where desh is
bourne up high
seeing nicky on that other roof
he cant get across to her
moving fast now
into the riad courtyard
bourne entering the hallway
moving up the stairs
and towards desh
meanwhile nicky moving down
looking out into the courtyard below
the sound of police getting nearer
bourne hearing the police too as he moves up onto a landing
bourne into a main room something stirring on a couch a girl and her little sister having a siesta
in another room two small boys fast asleep
a noise on the stairs above
quickly arranging a mirror getting line of sight bourne dipping into a corner
she gives him a look desh is in here somewhere
the door goes below them
the noise of police entering the riad
nicky signalling to bourne this way
they climb narrow stairs to the next floor
down below police begin searching rooms
waking the sleeping family
bourne and nicky creeping up the steps
then suddenly nicky spinning round as two silenced bullets speed past her and desh bursting out of a landing toilet
on to bourne
full on treadstone fighting in the narrow stairwell
crashing into a tiny disused lift cage silent constrained vicious
downstairs a young policeman hears the noise heading for the lift
nicky seeing the handle turn
she sends the lift up to the next floor
the policeman stepping back from the door directing the other cops out to the courtyard
people are spilling out into the atrium
bourne and desh spill out of the elevator and onto the roof
bourne kicking the gun spinning across the floor he and desh facing each other
desh with bourne straight over the edge
desh still on top just
a brutal exchange
matching each others moves like shadows
rolling falling onto another roof level
the two men tiring now
desh grabbing for the bag
bourne kicking them away
bourne has the upper hand now
deshs reactions slowing
no longer the match he was
bourne drags him to the ground
desh shivering convulsing
in the struggle bourne strangles desh
bourne and nicky hide deshs body
alright we need to be dead
you need to code that in
nicky codes into deshs pda both objectives achieved
in the cri hub the message comes up
vosen and landy believe nicky and bourne are both dead
the code from desh remains on screen both objectives achieved like an epitaph for bourne and nicky
vosen packs his briefcase
turns to wills
i want to be sure
have the station chief in rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub rosa check
and keep and eye on landy
the hub just got word bourne and nicky are dead
landy looks at him
landy looks away
get me a copy of bournes personnel file
bourne and nicky enter
bourne scrubs the blood from his hands
reveal nicky watching him from the bedroom
landy sits at her desk reviewing files on treadstone
open on her desk we see the file she will be looking at in the supremacy phone call
the way she examines the papers we get the sense she thinks something is missing some piece some file
bourne scrubbing the blood from his hands
nicky comes in touches his shoulder
theres a tenderness to it a re assurance
for a moment it looks like bourne might react
but the moment passes
landy opens a new file
bourne is toweling off
i can see all their faces
but i cant remember any names
landy looks at bournes kills
the faces bourne remembers
but there names are here and who they were why they were killed
bourne and nicky sitting together
i was starting to remember who they were
its just going to lead to more killing jason
are you sure you want that
bourne takes her words in
but who he is is eating him alive from the inside
ive killed people and ive tried to apologize for what ive done for what i am
none of it makes it better
another moment passes between them
then theyre going to come for you again
you are going to have to run now
she gets up
nicky dies her hair black
starts cutting it shorter
bourne walks with a now dark haired nicky
they exchange looks for a long beat
she turns towards the bus
it gets easier
landy finds a denotation in bournes file that he was recruited to treadstone by neal daniels
further down the page it says bourne was inducted into treadstone at the special research department facility at e st new york ny
then facility closed by order of director june
bourne looks at the tattered remains of daniels body and belongings
he goes through his briefcase and finds a nearly destroyed piece of paper with noah vosen director of operations cri written on it
bourne slips the morgue attendant a bribe
vosen is shaving
station chief in rabat just called they found a body
on final approach to jfk
bourne looks out the window to see the verizano narrows bridge
and beyond it manhattan
bourne is coming home
pam you need to see this
landy follows cronin into bournes passport is displayed on the computer monitor
this passport just cleared immigration at jfk ten minutes ago
its an early treadstone identity registered to jason bourne but he never used it and it never went to the grid
they dont know
no if they knew vosen wouldnt be in his office right now
bourne moves through the airport
its a hell of a risk
maybe bourne wants us to know just like naples maybe hes communicating
maybe hes trying to communicate with you
maybe we should communicate back
because i think i know what bournes looking for
bourne over the th street bridge arrives at cri goes into the adjacent building bourne uses his monocular to zoom in on a file vosen is looking at he sees
the word blackbriar
vosen puts the file back in the safe
landys cell phone rings
she answers it
i hear youre still looking for me
landy puts down her pencil
his phone rings
he picks it up
get in here
bourne called landy
vosen jumps up sprints toward the hub i guess i owe you an apology
vosen rushes in is that official
are we triangulating
off the record
you know how it is
trying good bye
she opens a file on her desk
bourne listening david webb
thats your real name
why the hell did she give him that
you were born in nixa missouri
why dont you come in and well talk about it
get some rest pam
you look tired
vosen realizes rushing out hes got line of sight on us
she spins to look for bourne vosen moving across the floor
this is a national security emergency
we have an imminent threat
landy takes out her gun
jason bourne is alive and at large in new york city
we believe in one thousand yards of this building
i want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area
send a flash message to langley prep for local backup assistance
high angle landy leaves cri
wills walks over to vosen
the look in his eye indicates that he thinks theres something odd about this landy just left the building
vosen looks at wills
a beat vosens suspicion building though he cant quite put his finger on what he suspects
check landys phone
is she using it
landy receives a text message
vosen leans in to the hubs back monitoring room
no calls since bourne wait a minute
she just got a text
landy heads for someplace now with purpose
vosen confers with wills
what the hell do you mean we cant read it
working on it frustrated how do you know a text came if you cant read it to wills are we on landy
more on the way
i want that goddamn text
we need to get out in front of her
vosen paces anxiously
tech points at big screen tudor city pl nd
come on foot
anyone not on landy goes to tudor city
to wills get the trucks
were going mobile
landy walks east toward tudor city
she looks around her for any signs of surveillance but finds nothing out of the ordinary
vosen and agents come running out of the front door
others leave through a side entrance
they jump in sedans
landy still being trailed by foot
vosen and agents race to tudor city
an electronic map on the dash
copy were going to take a left at st
one block settle at the corner
get the map up
its a bad place to pick its too exposed
he wouldnt have chosen it if he didnt have a reason
landy walks east through the crowded streets
bourne walks down the street enters a building
spotter on a rooftop
landy is on the east side now walking toward tudor city
an agents trails her on foot
another parallels her from across the street
series of shots cri cars arrive careful to stay several blocks from the meet site
they jump out and try to set up surreptitious surveillance posts
okay folks here we go box at two hundred meters
lets lock it down
bourne climbs stairs
landy walks agents are everywhere looking for her
vosen is still in car
as soon as you have eyes on landy i want to know
she becomes clear to agent
okay here we go
bourne climbs stairs
walks down a dank hallway
copy that i see her
landy stands on a corner waiting for bourne
any sign of bourne
tight shot on bournes face
fast tilt to tight on his hands pulling up what seems like a piece of clear tape
we cant tell where we are or what hes doing
landy looks around
tight on bournes hands placing the clear tape on a piece of clear plastic
again we cant tell whats going on
agents watch landy
vosens cell phone rings
this is jason bourne
vosen reels for a beat
then quickly scans the streets trying to see if he can spot bourne
how did you get this number
you didnt actually think i was coming to tudor city did you
no i guess not
but if its me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet
where are you right now
in my office
i doubt that
if you were in your office reveal that bourne is inside vosens office
wed be having this conversation face to face
bourne hangs up
puts a portable dictaphone up to vosens safe and his play noah vosen
as he places the plastic slide we saw in the ecus into the fingerprint reader
the safe pops open vosen stunned
is it possible
is it a trick
from the safe bourne scoops out the treadstone blackbriar folder bourne saw vosen putting into his safe
he flips it open
he scans down the page
his eye stopping at the words us citizen
he flips to another page another photo and again us citizen
bourne shoves the folders in his backpack and leaves
this is a code ten abort i want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort
back to the vehicles immediately back to cri immediately
bourne rushes down with his back pack
wills grabs the phone and hits a speed dial bourne got into your safe
bourne onto the street with back pack
series of shots vosens suv races lights and sirens across town
other cri cars race back across town
bourne walks out of a building backpack over his shoulder
bourne walks around a corner near cri
he hears a siren turn on a few blocks away
he starts to run
a sedan pulls to a stop as a door comes open
reveal landy on the sidewalk
she jumps in
what just happened
bourne got into vosens safe
cronin pulls out
east st street
cronin puts it together
bourne walking away from cri
agents leaving a building
getting into unmarked sedans and peeling out
as vosen races across town
i want the entire building searched
every goddamm airduct
do you understand
i want him found
the passenger side agent sees bourne points bourne cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger side agent doesnt have a shot while controlling the car makes
it almost impossible for the driver to fire accurately
the westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk
but bourne is too fast
hes already past them
the passenger side agent jumps out
but hes still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on bourne
the other cri car races the wrong way on the street but gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel traffic
vosen and wills race west on st
cri cars close in on nd on th on th ave
bourne races through the tunnel traffic and onto th street
he rushes east toward the spaghetti of concrete ramps leading into and out of port authority
he runs across th avenue as a third cri car screams up the street at him
several radios blare
hes heading for port authority
subject up the ramp eastbound into port authority
to tac team leader lethal force is authorized
i told tell them again
bourne runs up a one lane outgoing ramp
the driver pilots his car up the ramp behind bourne
he jams the accelerator down
hell be on top of bourne running him over in seconds a new jersey bound bus exits the complex and heads around the corner of the ramp it skids to
a stop when it sees bourne and the cri car giving chase heading right at the bus
the driver has to skid to a stop to avoid hitting the bus
bourne slides between the side of the bus and concrete guard rail
the driver calls it in cops and cri cars close in on port authority
one agent jumps out of his car on th avenue and rushes for the stairs
block every exit
i want a full perimeter on port authority bourne races up a set of stairs the rooftop parking lot
he surveys every aspect of his environment on the fly which includes his taking a quick peak over the concrete railing at the east end of the roof
next bourne rushes toward the parked cars
smashes the window of one to set off its alarm
then a second and a third setting off their alarms
the fourth window bourne smashes in doesnt set off an alarm
bourne pulls the door open and climbs in
inside the car bourne reaches under the dash and yanks handful of wires off the steering column and starts to expertly hotwire the car
into radio box him in
box him in
agents race up stairwells
two cri cars careen up the ramp to the passenger parking a separate ramp to the bus ramp we saw bourne on earlier
a third cri car races through the parking level just below the roof and up the circular ramp to the roof
to vosen hes on the roof
bourne works to hotwire the car
a cri car gets to the roof
two agents come from the elevator lobby
the three car alarms distract them
they search for bourne but cant find him at first
bourne gets the car engine on but given the wonders of modern anti theft technology his steering wheel is still locked
a second cri car arrives
bourne slams the car into low gear and backs up at high speed
he smashes into the car across the aisle from him
with a sharp metallic snap the wheel in bournes car is suddenly free he jams the car into drive pulls out into lane and stops
three cri cars here now
two head straight for him
a third blocks the exit ramp
bourne checks the rearview and sees two more agents pour from the elevator lobby one carrying the serious firepower of an m an m variant whose bullets can penetrate metal
they move into position to get a bead on him
but he doesnt move
the agents swarm toward him
what the hell is he doing
why is he waiting
weve got him
hes got nowhere to run
take him out
the agents clear their obstructions and drop their barrels toward bourne but before they can get a bead bourne slams the car into reverse again
petal to the metal in reverse the agents open fire
bourne ducks the lead slugs ripping through the windshield
but theres no dodging the shower of broken glass
as bourne disappears below the dashboard the cri agent adjusts his fire into the cars grill
virtually blind bourne races the hard pressed vehicle backwards as the agents fire decimates the cars driveline
bourne slips the car into neutral and takes a quick peek behind him
steers still speeding but quickly dying car towards a small gap between two parked cars at the edge of the parking structure
bournes car splits the gap between the parked cars hits the base of a low angled wall that slams the back of his car up and over the wall
bourne is pounded as his car jounces onto the wall a second later the front end seesaws over the top the sudden angle change exposes for an instant the bottom
of bournes car to the shooters
several rounds rip through the floorboard and tear past bournes head just before his car drops upside down for feet and slams onto a row of parked cars
the impact rips bourne from the seat and slams him hard against the roof
bourne struggles out of the car knowing he has only a moment before the armed agents will fire down into his over turned car
ho ly shit
practically screaming into his handheld he did what
the cri agents race to the spot where bournes car disappeared over the railing and reflexively fire into bournes car but theyre too late
bournes already out
he disappears from sight under the covered parking structure
get down there
as it speeds toward the spaghetti of ramps leading in and out of port authority two blocks away
who has eyeball on him
who has eyeball
one of the agents scrambles over the edge and starts to climb down
other agents race for the stairs
dont tell me youve lost him
whos on street level
street level backup
clearly there is no one down there
bournes car jump from the roof has completely flat footed them
to wills get nypd backup
and fbi dea any other federal assets we can draft
two cri cars race down from the roof to try to get to the level bournes on
bourne cuts off a guy cruising for a parking space and pulls him from his car and races away as the agent from the roof lands hard behind him
bournes race to the exit is cut off as a rd cri sedan slides into view and its occupants open fire on bourne in a head on charge
the just stolen vehicle takes heavy fire as bourne reacts instantaneously thumbing on the cruise control shouldering his door open and slamming the gas pedal to the floor as he
dives out of the car
the agents react as bournes sedan torpedoes them head on
hit hard theyre taken out of the fight as metal collapses glass shatters and airbags explode
bourne tumbles to a stop at the rear of a parked car as his car implodes against the oncoming agents
instantly bourne is on his feet moving between the parked cars to engage another cri sedan traveling parallel to the course of the wrecked one
the agents in this sedan are distracted by the still echoing crash and are caught off guard as bourne steps out and points his gun at the driver
the driver ducks and floors his gas pedal in a desperate effort to save his own life
as the sedan suddenly accelerates bourne deliberately shifts his aim to the sedans front tire and fires
the tire explodes and the car suddenly veers left and slams into a parked car pitching the driver violently against the unyielding interior of the sedan
an instant later bourne rips the radio off the dazed drivers belt just before he cold cocks him with it
with the wreck still echoing through the garage bourne has to deal with the arrival of the first nypd sedan
bourne takes on the persona of an alarmed witness as the on edge cop climbs out of his car but bournes performance is cut short as the agent running from
his drop from the roof arrives and opens fire
the police officer goes down in the hail of gunfire as bourne turns and expertly drops the gunman with a single shot
the increasing volume of squealing tires alerts bourne to a new threat he pulls the officer into some cover and grabs the officers radio
port authority parking lot
bourne rips a piece of his sweater off and ties a makeshift tourniquet for the officer
then he hands the cop his radio back
stay out of sight until one of your own arrive
we pick him up as he jumps into the cops car and guns the engine and heads for the exits
cri agents are confused for a second until they pick up the nypd car exiting port authority on one of the ramps
but thats all the time bourne needs bourne turns on his lights and siren and speeds east followed closely by a cri sedan
as cars yield to bournes siren a taxi tries to jump into bournes wake but a cri sedan punches the taxi back to the right
it ricochets off several parked cars before regaining control
bourne struggles to keep his over matched vehicle ahead of the more powerful cri sedan which tries to spin bourne out by hitting his bumper
bourne tacks right quickly and barely avoids a stopped car
the cri sedan flanking bournes slams into the rear of that car spinning it degrees into the path of the trailing cri sedan which destroys itself in the resulting collision
and blocks the path of the other cri sedan
bourne is home free
he looks around and spots a sign that indicates a right turn and says to holland tunnel us
bourne turns right suddenly the window next to his head explodes as two more shots rip through his door to tear a jagged wound into the top of bournes leg
reveal paz his suv racing along the curb lane
as bournes car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the intersection paz swerves his car into that car and punches it into the side of bournes car
bournes car is knocked spinning paz keeps charging forward and slams into the back of bournes car
with his front tires spinning wildly bourne fights to straighten his car as another cri sedan appears and tries to box bournes car by sliding into his path
bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the cri sedan and race down the avenue with paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit
paz gains on him and bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny paz the kill shot he is all too capable of
just ahead of bourne two government suvs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path
bourne instantly spins his car degrees and continues on barreling into the roadblock backwards
as bournes car plows through the suvs he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse as paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in bournes
paz and the cri sedan are all over bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto south st
as paz and the cri sedan overwhelm bournes battered vehicle
on his police radio bourne singles out an nypd officer call sign alpha racing toward the intersection just ahead
bourne slows then speeds up quickly to time it right the cri car almost hits his bumper then has to accelerate through the upcoming intersection
as he does the cop car bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into the cri sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car
swerving wildly paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy suv into the back of bournes car pushing him into the oncoming traffic
several cars swerve left and right as paz pushes bourne sideways onto the ramped end of a k rail dividing the street ahead
the nearly upended car grinds down the k rail until the rear of bournes car strikes an obstruction which punches it back into the lane as it slams against the
front of pazs suv knocking the suv sideways into a row of parked cars
bournes car hits parked cars on the other side of the road
smoke and steam sirens chaos bourne kicks the window out of the police car
ready a paz in the car
bloody from the crash really a fucked up
he comes to
and bourne is there
gun pointed at his head
the two assassins look at each other
then bourne lowers his gun
on paz as the wheels start to turn
the asset lost bourne

vosen reacts bourne exits from the subway
bourne walks north
bournes profile is up on screen

he dials a number bourne reaches st street and nd ave
he looks up at the sign
hirschs office is located in the srds front office which is located covertly on a floor of the new building of the hospital
he is the longtime head of srd and a powerful behind the scenes official at cia
hirsch is put simply not a man to be trifled with
hes a year cia veteran
one of the great brains in the agencys history but also a man who knows how to wield power silently invisibly and to tremendous effect
his phone buzzes
vosen at the other end of the line bourne knows everything
i think hes heading for you right now
hes coming home noah
theres a wistfulness in the way he says it
but also the sense that this was absolutely inevitable
and hes calm about it doesnt show any fear doesnt reach for a gun

thats what he knows
ill keep him in play until you arrive
bourne arrives at the johnston medical center
he looks up to see
the image of that has been haunting his dreams
this is the place
when he looks down landy steps out of the lobby to meet him on the sidewalk
theyll kill you for giving me this place
isnt much of a code
my guess is vosens already on his way
whyd you do it

bourne hands her the black bag and enters the hospital
come in with me
its better if we do this together
shakes head this is where it started for me this is where it ends
she watches the doors close behind him
landy lets him go
quick shots of six different cri sedans and suvs rushing toward the hospital
landy looks in the backpack
she unzips the backpack and looks in at the the blackbriar operations file
a cover page inside utmost secrecy
potentially explosive public reaction would jeopardize the program
another page terminated stamped across the photos of victims
next to the victim from the inciting incident the words us citizen
oh my god
a third page more photos no terminated on these
us citizen stamped next to each one
bourne uses the card reader he took from vosens safe to enter a restricted access elevator
a guard comes
bourne aims his pistol at him as the elevator door closes
landy walks down the street
she looks up to spot two black sedans speeding east on st turns south two suvs coming up york
shit a block south of the hospital stuck in traffic vosen points
shes got bournes backpack
bourne flips up the elevator stop button and uses the access card to enter a secure corridor landy runs across the lobby
vosens suv careens to a stop behind a bunch of traffic
still a half block from the entry door but its close enough bourne rushes down a nondescript corridor vosen and cri agents rush into the lobby
to a group of six agents ill find landy
you get to the training wing and get bourne
a security guard comes over
do you know who i am
the guard nods wheres your security room
landy looks around
finds an open office
she pushes open the door and runs to the fax machine
she starts faxing the blackbriar documents bourne took from vosens safe
i want to see all your footage for the last three minutes
bourne stares down the corridor from his dreams the corridor daniels lead him down in his flashback
we see bourne go into that first day bournes pov being led down this corridor by daniels
bourne moves down the corridor
bourne reaches the end of the hall
he looks around flashback style bourne was standing at this door
vosen enters the room
the last pages have been faxed
you better get a good lawyer
then spins gun up hirsch is there halfway down the corridor behind him
put the gun down
i wouldnt be here if i didnt want to talk
ive spent three years running
three years trying to find out who i was
hirsch moves toward bourne completely unfazed by the gun
you still dont have it all back do you
you havent filled in all the pieces
lets start with the moment you found out i wouldnt execute wombosi
the amnesia wasnt the issue it was the fact that i didnt pull the trigger
one lapse meant your conditioning had failed
bourne grabs hirsch and slams him against the wall it was always you behind conklin behind abbott
they were just following orders
bourne grabs hirsch and pushes him to the wall
searches him for weapons
completely calm im unarmed jason
shoving hirsch hard against the wall david
im david webb
close on bournes face you were david webb but not anymore
bourne stands with hirsch
why did you pick me

hirsch uses his free hand to hit the keypad on the wall
the room in use sign lights up
bourne looks up flashback style bourne remembers that keypad that room in use sign from the first day
bourne and hirsch enter
you volunteered right here

hirsch removes a pair of dog tags from his jacket pocket
holds them out to bourne
bourne takes the dog tags
stares at them
insert of the dog tags webb david o negative catholic bourne hands over his dog tags

you were a soldier ready to serve his country
just like thousands of others except you were a prodigy with languages
and a perfect shot

bourne raises the gun to hirsch
you could have left at any time

bourne sitting in a chair looking terrible
hirsch looks at him from behind the desk
you havent slept for a long time have you david
have you made a decision
this cant go on you know
you have to decide

youre not a liar are you
or too weak to see this through
this is it
let go of david webb
will you give yourself to this program
bourne looks down a gun in his hand
he gets to his feet swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded figure
the man slumps over
bourne stares at what hes done
youre no longer david webb
from now on youll be known as jason bourne
welcome to the program
daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is dead
just then kramer walks through the door
send him to operations
and now in real time bourne comes out of the flashback
he stares back at hirsch

bourne lowers the gun
i remember everything

you made yourself into who you are
im done running
thats why im here
to end you to shut this down
im no longer jason bourne
so now youre going to kill me
you dont deserve the star they give you on the wall at langley
just then bourne spins agents arrive at the door
the agents fire at the door handle to get it open
bourne looks out a window
sees the layout of a roof several stories below
then he turns and shoots out the rooms mirrored observation window
bourne dives through it just as agents rush in and open fire at him
bourne races through corridors loosing the cri agents
bourne runs out onto the roof
rushes across it to look over the edge
its a straight drop to the fdr stories down
he races to another ledge the east river below him
but he has to clear a foot supporting wall at the base of the building to hit the water
he backs up to get a running leap
as he does he turns and sees paz who is holding a gun on him
why didnt you take the shot
bourne looks at him
do you even know why youre trying to kill me
look at what they make you give
bourne turns and runs off the roof
paz fires into the air
follow bourne as he drops fourteen stories into the freezing river multiple angles bourne goes into the river
bourne in a dead mans float
as his clothes soak through he begins to sink
farther and farther from bournes dead still sinking
as overlapping interweaving voice overs begin fbi agents arrested several senior cia officials today in connection with the broadening scandal enveloping washington today assassination program code named blackbriar was exposed
by a former assassin named david webb program reportedly targeting us citizens in some cases
cia director ezra kramer produced explosive documents for the senate committee indicating blackbriar was authorized at the highest levels of government
nicky goes to the bar of at a low end tourist bar with several other customers
she stands there eyes fixed on a tv behind the bar webb who was known inside the intelligence community as jason bourne jumped from the fourteenth floor of the cia
facility where he was trained in new york into the east river below
while experts say it would be nearly impossible to survive the fall despite two weeks of efforts his body has still not been recovered
push in on the smile that develops on nickys face
as we cue the moby extreme ways sting bournes body sinking toward the bottom
when all of a sudden it comes to life arms together legs kick powerfully and bourne swims away
