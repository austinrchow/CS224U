chandor july the frame is filled with the face of peter sullivan a year old risk assessment analyst
he has a doctorate from mit and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens
an elevator door opens and four human resources people come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes
they walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor
the scope of the floor now comes into frame
there are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers
peter gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him seth bregman a young analyst in his early twenties
is that them
nods yes jesus christ
the human resources people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches
seth contd are they going to do it right there
will emerson sitting next to them leans back in his chair
whispered have you guys ever seen this before
best to just ignore it
keep your head down and get back to work
and dont watch
the hr people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person and asking their name
it is brutal
the camera follows one hr woman heather with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees she walks right past the three guys then stops
a bit down from them
im afraid we have to speak with you
tim gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman
peter puts on his headphones and very loud rap music drowns out all other noise and peter tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen
the sequence follows the hr people walking around and firing people intercut with peter just staring at his computer screen
it runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind peter and taps him on the shoulder
he takes off his headphones and the music stops
he is shell shocked
heather contd eric dale
im not eric dale
im so sorry
hes my boss hes down that hall
eric dale is sitting at his desk he is years old and looks exhausted
he looks out through the glass of his office as she walks over to the door
eric walks out the door first
they walk along the full length of the trading floor to reach one of the conference rooms
everyone left on the floor is watching
there is a more senior looking human resources lawyer lauren bratberg already sitting at the table
they all sit and look at each other for a beat
dale im obviously sorry that we are here today but these are extra ordinary times as you very well must know
i run risk management
it just doesnt seem like a natural place to start cutting
i hope you understand that this is in no way personal
a majority of this floor is being let go today
bratberg is now going to run through the details of what the firm is offering
lauren bratberg slides across the table a very thick severance contract agreement
dale the firm is offering you six months severance at half your salary
you will keep all unvested options that you currently hold
health will be extended through that period
you have till tomorrow at
she looks at her watch
lauren bratberg contd to either take the offer or it will be revoked
do you understand
now unfortunately mr
dale due to the highly sensitive nature of your work here the firm has to take certain precautions for security purposes that may seem punitive in nature
i hope considering your
she looks down at the piece of paper in front of her to fact check
lauren bratberg contd over years of service to the firm you will understand that these measures are in no way a reflection of the firms feelings towards your performance or
shes apologizing for whats about to happen
your company email access to the server access to the building and your mobile data and phone service will all be severed as of this meeting
she points behind him and a smallish benign looking security guard is standing in the doorway
lauren bratberg contd will take you to your office so that you can clear out your personal belongings
what about my current ongoing work
im right in the
the firm has worked out its transition plan and is prepared to move forward but we appreciate your concern
we understand that this is very difficult and here is my card
please contact me over the next few weeks if there is anything that i can do to help you through this transition in your life
they all stare at each other in silence for several long awkward beats
eric finally stands up and walks out with the guard and back over to his office
eric walks into the office and sits at his desk and begins to clear his things out into a file box
the guard stands at the door
eventually erics sympathetic yet still energetic immediate superior will emerson comes to the door
im very sorry
are you still alive
its a total bloodbath
if there was anything i coulda done you know i woulda done it
one more thing
who was it
was it rogers
you know me
im not gonna say
will emerson just looks back at him in silence
eric contd that cunt
i knew it
i never should have gone to her last year
look it wasnt anyone
its just bad luck
they look at each other with respect but do not shake hands as will emerson starts to leave the office
you know i was just in the middle of a bunch of shit here that someone should really take a look at
eric they are telling us that everyone has got to get out of here and leave everything behind
while we appreciate your concern this is not your problem anymore
eric looks straight ahead as will leaves the office
he packs up the last of his things which does not take long then stands and gets ready to walk out
he looks around and heads out into the cubicle area
outside his office peter and seth are standing to say goodbye
eric i am very sorry
did they say what was going to happen with us
no it will be ugly around here for a while but you guys will be fine
well take care eric
well ill be seeing you around
eric turns and begins to walk out towards the elevator
peter walks out behind him
they both stand there in silence waiting for the elevator then
i just wanted to say thank you
thats not necessary
well it is
you were the person around here that i
eric looks at him and understands
peter turns around and begins to walk back toward his desk
peter turns back and eric reaches into one of his boxes and takes out a small key chain portable hard drive and hands it to peter
eric contd i was close to something here
but they wouldnt let me finish it
take a look
the elevator doors open and eric gets into the elevator
just as the doors are closing he says
eric contd be careful
the doors close
sam rogers a year old executive is sitting behind his desk looking out the window
will emerson gently knocks on the door enters then sits on the couch
well that was fucking hideous
its gonna get worse before it gets better
got any nicorettes
im out of nicorettes which means im gonna kill someone in about minutes
my dog is dying
just spoke to the vet its some fucking tumor on her liver
im paying almost a thousand bucks a day to keep her alive
and i dont have a clue what to do about it
they both sit in silence and look out the window
well theyre all gone
how many do we have left
make sure everyone is out there i need to say something
they are ready for you
will leaves sam in his office
sam looks as if he may not move then snaps out of it
sam rogers walks out of his office and stands in front of the trading floor that just an hour before had seated people
now just thirty three are scattered throughout the vast mostly empty space
they all look up in silence at him
long pause then sams face begins to glow a bit
his posture straightens he fills up
he speaks slowly at first then builds
you are all still here for a reason
most of this floor was just sent home
we have spent the last hour saying good bye
they were good people and they were good at their jobs
but you all were better
now they are gone
they are not to be thought of again
this is your opportunity
on every floor of this building and in every office from hong kong to london the same thing is happening
before this is all done of every ten guys who were standing between you and your bosss job are now gone
that is your opportunity
ive been at this place for thirty four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this
but you all are survivors
and that is how this firm over years has always continued to grow stronger
so hold your heads high
and get back to work
he looks out at them then turns and heads back into his office and closes the door
sam falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated daze
his eyes no longer believe what he says
eric dale walks out the front door carrying the file boxes
there are other people streaming out the door doing the same thing
eric stops turns and looks up at the building then tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it has been shut off by the
he looks up to the sky and cant believe his fate
as he looks down he sees a woman sarah robertson serious classically beautiful and dressed in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into the building
he cant help himself
sarah does not respond
eric contd sarah robertson
this time she looks up
when she sees him she debates if she should stop
he slowly moves a little closer to her still carrying the slightly tattered box with his personal belongings in it
eric contd you shut off my phone
i didnt do anything
they stare at each other
they look at each other for a longer beat both a little shocked that eric was so openly confrontational
she turns and heads back inside quickly
eric drops the phone to the ground and walks away
most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting ready to go home or out for the night
peter is sitting at his desk holding the portable hard drive
seth is getting ready to leave behind him
peter stares down at the drive in his hand trying to decide whether to proceed
just a little freaked out
you want to get a drink
nah i need to clean up a few things around here
everyone is going out
nah im fine
well give me a call if you change your mind
where are you going
ill call you when im done
be glad youre still alive
seth walks out and peter puts on his headphones the music kicks in again
he picks up the portable hard drive looks around and sees no one then inserts it into his computer
he has four large screens in front of him and as he begins opening window upon window of mathematical models his face begins to soften and he gets into his
the frame is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers flying by
sam is sitting next to the exam table his dog is on the table lying down very sedated
they both stare forward
in a locked off shot seth and will are sitting on a couch staring forward
figures cross frame and occasionally another banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of
they are celebrating but it seems a little forced
peter is still working on the numbers although his face starts to carry a more serious look
he is now wearing glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them
the numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes
sam is still sitting next to his dog on the exam table
peter is still in front of his computer he puts his glasses back on looks at the screen then quickly picks up the phone and dials
to himself as he dials come on come on
the number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service
peter hangs up the phone
he looks back at the screen
then picks up the phone again and dials
i cant hear you
go outside i cant hear you
give me a sec
where are you
are you with will
i think hes still here
you have to go get him and get back up here
you want me to get our bosss boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at on a thursday night
our boss just got axed so technically he is our boss and yes
just do it seth
alright well be there in ten
seth and will walk through the door and into the empty main trading floor
the lights are down and there is a cleaning person vacuuming in the far background
they walk over to peters desk
hey look who it is burning the candle at both ends
there arent anymore cuts planned though so you can stop kissing my ass honestly i dont even understand what you guys do
will i am so sorry to call you back but i really think
dont worry about it
will is a bit drunk but seth looks at peters face and realizes something is up
seth contd whats going on
look at this
seth comes around and sits at peters desk
peter contd eric gave me this file before he left
and he told me he couldnt quite figure it out then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is be careful
so im obviously a little curious
so i get into it a bit and i realize that all he was missing was
well its not good
seth looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the pages
what is he doing here
go to model four and it makes more sense
will is now paying closer attention standing over their shoulder
what is this
this is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time
but what eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard var model
what are those levels
well its a fairly complicated
the volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another
so whats happening
we are starting to test those historic patterns
peter starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on his screen
monday last friday last wednesday and monday
two fridays ago
i get it
seth scrolls the final page on the graph
once this thing gets going in the wrong direction
the losses are greater than the current value of the company
wait and this is just our floor
they all look at each other long and hard
where the fuck is eric dale
i cant find him they cut off his phone
will starts off towards his office and is suddenly quite sober
peter and seth follow him
they turned off everyones phone who they axed today
and hes got no other cell
how does he not have his own cellphone
i tried its been turned off
i think i have his home number
youre going to call his house
do we even know if hes right
will looks at peter and seth standing in front of his desk
it seems pretty fucking right to me
the phone starts ringing
we never see mrs
dale but we can just make out her responses through the receiver
this is will emerson calling
im fine thanks
i was wondering if eric was there
yes we tried but his cell doesnt seem to be working
will emerson contd ok could you have him call me the moment he gets home the moment he arrives
thank you very much
will hangs up the phone
will emerson contd where the fuck is he
doesnt he have like three kids
im just saying would you go home
i know where he is
you two need to go get him
will writes the address on a piece of paper
hands it to them
will emerson contd there will be a car waiting for you downstairs
get him back here
what are you going to do
im calling sam
sam rogers is driving in his car home from the vet trying to stay awake when his blackberry starts ringing next to him
he looks down at it then out to the road then decides to answer
its at night
i know im sorry
i wouldnt have called
whats the problem
i think you need to get down here
i am well aware of the fucking time sam
but you need to see this
email it to me
i dont think that is a good idea
wills last words hang in the air
im on my way
seth and peter sit in the back of the plush car as it struggles through traffic up town
seth reaches into his bag and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag
their conversation is quiet as if they are afraid someone might be listening
you want one
peter gives him a bit of a look
what we got them on our way to meet you at the office
we didnt know what the fuck you wanted to talk about
almost to himself thought you mightve gotten some chick pregnant or something
i havent gotten laid in so long thats not possible at this point
i guess thats true
peter looks out the window at all the people on the street enjoying the thursday night
look at these people
we are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending and theyve got no idea whats coming
seths demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesnt seem to project much in the way of stress
peter contd right
i try not to let work get to me
ive noticed that about you actually
look we are twenty three years old
whatever same thing i made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year
pushing some numbers around on a computer screen so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it and then make a bet against
some other jock half way around the world who if he wasnt doing this would probably be in some otb somewhere putting it all on number seven
and at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins
peter continues to look out the window in silence for a long beat
then with a little sly humor and a smile to seth you do know its a little more complicated than that
seths phone starts playing a ring tone
he looks down at the text
he wants to know if weve found him
what do i tell him
tell him that we havent found him
sam rogers comes through the door from the elevator looking quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading floor
he looks around then heads over to will emersons office where the light is on
sam lightly knocks on the glass
sam looks at will for some hint of what is going on then eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair
they wait for who goes first
before he was escorted out of the building by security
i had nothing to do with that
im sorry go on
so as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to peter sullivan
whos peter sullivan again
one of erics guys
and tells him that he was almost on to something but hasnt been able to figure it out
so he gives him the disk and says give it a try
but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is be careful
take a look
speak you know i cant read those fucking things they put together
basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk nice job by the way and he seems to have nailed it
the kid figured out what eric was missing
will gives him a long pause
it isnt good
wills look gets sam up and he comes over to stand behind will at his desk and look at the computer
will emerson contd as far as i can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits
which i guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily
and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry
and how close to those limits have we gotten
oh were beyond close
we broke through five or six days over the last two weeks but weve managed to stay on the upside of it
well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it
what am i looking at
will takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole lot of zeroes after it
sams look says it all
and that wouldnt even be that bad a day for us
is this right
i dont know
where is eric
we shut his phone off
of course we did
and he hasnt come home yet i spoke to his wife
hes probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere
wheres the kid who did this
out looking for eric
do we think he knows what hes doing
i dont know
what do i know
well get him back here
peter and seth are sitting at the bar each with a drink facing camera
there are women dancing in the background and one dancing in front of them peter and seth look up occasionally
we should probably tell will hes not here
they both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks
what do you think this girl makes in a night
peter keeps looking forward
all things considered thats not bad
eventually seths phone starts to ring
he picks it up
seth contd will
no no we asked and no ones seen him
they exchange a look and slam their drinks
this time they are really stuck in traffic the car is not moving at all
eventually the car starts moving and seths phone starts buzzing with a text again
hes freaking out
we need to get down there
they look out into the city
finally seth reaches into his bag and takes out the forty in the paper bag and starts drinking the beer again
he takes a big sip
seth contd whata you think rogers makes in a year
i have no idea
come on play along
i dont know what year
three quarters of a million bucks
not even close
will emerson made two and half million bucks last year
seth looks at him showing he is serious
peter contd fuck you
how do you know that
he told me
he just told you that
well i asked him
do you think thats true
thats fucked up
does that seem right to you
so what do you think that means rogers puts away
i have no idea
they both just look straight forward seth takes a big gulp of the beer
peter contd this fucking traffic
we should have taken a the subway
the doors of the elevator open and peter and seth look up as will emerson and sam rogers are standing in front of them about to get onto the elevator
will and sam are now dressed with fresh shirts ties and suits and look as if they are ready to start a new day even though it is almost one
in the morning
seth is still holding the forty in the paper bag
will looks at it
they share a glancing smile
will and sam step into the elevator keeping the guys in it
youre coming with us
sam this is seth bregman and this is peter sullivan
they all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until will
where are we going
going to get a second opinion on your work peter
peter and seth look at each other growing more concerned
the doors open and they exit
seth looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but cant find a trash can
they follow sam and will down a long hallway that is crowded with assistant cubicles
eventually they turn into a small conference room that has no windows
it is claustrophobic
there are four people sitting at the table
everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands
slight hellos etc
they all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper a pencil and an empty binder
sitting at the head of the table is jared cohen
he is a blond boyish looking year old although carries himself with intense confidence
he is the head of all fixed income securities and oversees roughly employees
next to him is his chief risk management officer sarah robertson the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with eric
next to her is her right hand man ramesh shah a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer
they are all dressed sharply for a new day
all present look down at him
so sam what do you have for us
it should be here in a minute
finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge
well why dont we start by introducing everyone then
this is sarah robertson who you know our chief risk management officer ramesh shah from upstairs and david horn one of the firms in house counsel
nice to meet you all
this is will emerson my head of trading and this is
peter sullivan and seth bregman
they work in our risk department
where is eric dale
he was let go today
jared cohen looks at sarah robertson as it would have been her call to let eric go she nods yes
so whos left in your risk department
as of today that would be peter and our junior analyst seth
everyone looks down the table at peter and seth
their inexperience glares back
jared looks back at sarah then the room goes silent again
finally a copy room staffer knocks on the door
please just give one to everyone thanks
the copy room guy hands out the packets to everyone in the room
so apparently eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to peter
here and told him to see what he thought
peter figured a few things out that eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out
where is eric dale now
hes been unreachable since he left the office
jared cohen and the others open up the printout in front of them and start reviewing
sam will peter and seth just sit in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as they all read
this goes on for a full very long minute
finally peter this is your work
but this draft is yours
again derived from mr
dales original model
and what is your background
i have been with the firm for two years working with eric that whole time
but i hold a doctorate in engineering specialist in propulsion from mit with a bachelors from penn
whats a specialty in propulsion
in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads
so you are a rocket scientist
the whole table looks over at peter with some awe
how did you end up here
well its all just numbers really youre just changing what youre adding up
and if i may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here
jared looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his tone suddenly switches to serious testy even
what time is it
sam and jared just look at each other in silence for a bit
what do you have in exposure right now tonight
i dont know
sullivans numbers are correct
ramesh looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through the numbers and takes a beat too long
ramesh checks his number
and im guessing by the fact that you two havent said anything that the math checks out
jared looks over at sarah and ramesh
sarah then looks to ramesh
she looks back
look wed need a little more time to go over this but mr
sullivan here seems to know what hes doing
and i dont have to tell you that this is a problem
thank you for that
what time is it
jared stands up and walks around the small room
the rest of the room goes silent
finally jared cohen contd sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books
all of it
i dont know a couple weeks
but as you certainly know our business is selling and buying
it doesnt work for very long without both components
if we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesnt hide under the rug it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end
and right quick
how many traders do we have left between your floor and petersens
i dont know sixty
ramesh has been looking down at the numbers while this conversation has been taking place
jared ive just been looking here a little closer and its these var numbers that are really setting this thing off
jared holds up a hand to interrupt ramesh
jared nods his head his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing
excuse me i need to make a quick call
jared calmly stands up and steps out of the room for a long moment
the room stays completely quiet the whole time he is gone
we hear nothing
it is awkward to say the least
he comes back in and sits down without missing a beat
jared cohen contd please
i was just saying and just speaking completely off the record here it wont be long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we
are looking at here
if they havent already
and sarah what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books if they had to be
why would they still be on the books
because suddenly no one wants to buy them
oh fuck you sam
give me a fucking break all at once
without an active market it could take weeks months for me to value them correctly
youd have to go block by block
its a very simple business jared
you and i talked about this last year
jared turns around suddenly and cuts him off
will peter and
seth could you please excuse us for a few minutes
they stand up and start to exit the room
jared cohen contd oh and peter
who else has seen this
peter thinks that through
besides us here
and can it really be that we dont know where eric dale is
im afraid so
his wife tells us he hasnt come home yet
and the firm shut off his phone today
well i need to know where he is
will seth and peter leave the room and close the door behind them
they cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring out the window
they talk very quietly
jesus fucking christ
who is that guy
hes sams boss
he looks like hes fifteen years old
how old is he
hes like forty
how does that happen
oh it happens all the time
except to me
kids a fucking killer
what are they talking about
it aint pretty
what aint pretty
if people suddenly stop buying the shit were selling
they all look out the window
will emerson contd you guys smoke
well you should
jared you cant do what you are thinking about doing
what if we dont have a choice
what does that mean
you dont have a choice
have you looked at these numbers sam
yes but what the hell do i know
jared cohen comes back over to the table and picks up the packet
shah tell me if im wrong but to me these numbers dont add up
if i may id like to take some time before we
jared we cant answer that yet
are you fucking kidding me
this is exactly what weve
sarah now cuts him off abruptly
we need a little time before we can give you our conclusion
sarah closes the issue off with another look to jared
we meet in minutes
sam do you have this file
yes here it is
sam slides him the hard drive across the table they all take a second to follow it
and sam we need eric dale its making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while hes not even
aware hes holding the knife in his hand
sarah and ramesh leave the room as sam is left alone with what are you going to do
are you going to call him
they both look at each other for a long beat
i already did
sam puts his hand on jareds shoulder briefly
they walk over towards the edge
it is a very clear night
shit thats a long way down
yeah it is
they sit down on a girder then light up
wills look and tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the night
sarah and jared wait for the elevator alone in silence
the doors finally open and they get in
still not a word
is this really where you want to be taking this at this point
we dont even know if hes right
how long should this take you to confirm
silence except for the ding as it comes to the floor and the doors open
they are all still smoking and looking out over the city
finally will stands up and goes over to the edge and looks over
he jumps up and sits on the edge
did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall but instead its the subconscious
fearing that they might jump
its a fear of losing faith
well thats a little deep and depressing thank you
yeah well i can get a little dark sometimes
will come on
will jumps down and comes back over to sit down
they stare out again
beat so it looks like they are gonna have us dump this shit
yeah you watch
a trillion bucks
im just saying
how would they even do that
but theyll figure out a way
ive been at this place for ten years and ive seen some things that you wouldnt believe
and when all is said and done
they dont lose money
they dont care if everyone else does but they wont
did you really make two and half million bucks last year
what do you do with all that money
i dont know really
it goes pretty quick
you learn to spend whats in your pocket
two and a half million goes quickly
well the tax man takes half of it up front
so now you got what
million and a quarter
mortgage grabs another k i gave to my parents to live off so now you got what
i bought a car last year for
probably another eating
on clothes put away for a rainy day
and whats that
will emerson takes a long drag off his cigarette
i spent dollars on booze dancers and whores
yeah kinda shocked me although i was able to write most of it off as entertainment
with that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive corporate helicopter comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their
they are now yelling above the rotor noise
will emerson contd what time is it
oh here they go
they are bringing in the cavalry
we better get down there
jared and sam are sitting in the office silently looking out the window
the office is very large and has a full sitting area with two couches
jared is intensely going over the papers in front of him
sam is just looking out the window
how old are you
jared stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares out the window as well
this is a very
very bad dream
sam looks over at him directly
i dont know seems like we actually may have just finally woken up
sarah robertson comes to the door
sam sits up
how do we look
her look says it all
sam rogers contd i should go
no you should stay
dead calm delivery its all legit
the kid killed it
the formula is worthless
they all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost
what do you mean
there are eight trillion dollars of paper around the world relying on that equation
we were wrong
you mean you were wrong
dont even start
this was discussed
im heading to the conference room
id like you to hear this
i dont want to hear this
sam stares at them both
sam rogers contd how do you think ive stuck around this place so long
he walks out of the room
sarah and jared look each other over
ive called tuld
is there a contingency plan here
a contingency plan
we went all in on this one
so weve got ourselves quite exposed here
to tuld or the market
they both stare at each other
jareds phone buzzes
he takes it out and his face says it all
sarah robertson contd hes here
his face says yes
sarah walks out
jared stands up and straightens his tie in the reflection of the window
tracking shot of sarah and jared walking through cubicles
they cut through a short cut near the freight elevator
will peter and seth are coming down the stairway from the roof
we were just grabbing a cigarette on the roof and a very spiffy looking helicopter dive bombed us and then landed
come with us
i dont know
do you want all of us yes
jared ushers the whole group towards the conference room
all five walk in silence
finally just one piece of advice to everyone here before we go in there
this could get a bit ugly but whatever you do
tell the truth
dont try to change a word of it no sugar coating
no one here is smart enough
including the rocket scientist
he continues on
the guys are taken aback because standing right outside the opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for
the day ahead
they are already in there waiting for you
they come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city
it is filled with people along one side of the table
there are a team of five lawyers three compliance officers a couple of key board members twelve in all
on the near side of the table sits ramesh shah surrounded by empty chairs all alone
the head of the table is empty
they all file in and sit down
they all sit in silence
finally from a side door john tuld comes walking into the room
he is dressed in a average suit and tie is not tall late fifties and doesnt have a hair on his head
he carries himself without much exception
his eyes however tell a far different tale
intense even at rest
he walks the length of the room everyone half stands up
please sit down
he then seats himself at the head of the table
everyone in the room has the printout in front of them
jared is seated immediately to his left then sam then sarah ramesh will peter and finally seth
john tuld contd welcome everyone
i must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what ive been told this matter needs to be handled urgently so urgently in fact
that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago
john tuld contd but that is spilt milk under the bridge
so why doesnt someone please try to explain to me whats the problem here
everyone looks around the room a bit and finally jared speaks up
tuld as i mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout
he cuts him off
jared its a little early for all that how bout in english
actually id like to hear from the guy who put this thing together
sullivan is it
does he speak english
id like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess
well thats peter sullivan here
jared looks down the table to peter as does everyone else in the room
jared gives him a go ahead look
ah there he is
how old are you mr
im twenty seven sir
please call me john
sullivan why dont you tell me what you think is going on here and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever i didnt get
here on my brains i can assure you of that
peter is very nervous
as i guess you may or may not know i work for mr
rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at mbs now you lost me at m
i was joking mr
well as you probably know over the last months the firm has begun packaging new mbs products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security
this has been very profitable as i imagine you noticed
well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day
the problem which is i guess why we are here tonight is that it takes us
almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint
sullivan that challenge is
we have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to
but the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing or allowed to do
in any other circumstance thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags
and how far have we pushed that profile tonight mr
we have pushed it to
at mbs alone
give or take
give or take
sullivan what i am guessing and give me a little rope here what i am guessing that your report here says is that considering the shall we say bumpy road
weve been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past dont seem to make much sense anymore considering whats taking place today
actually not taking place today but whats already taken place over the last two weeks
so what youre saying is its already happened
sullivan what does your model say that means for us here
well thats where it becomes a projection
peter looks down at jared for approval to go forward
youre speaking with me mr
if those assets were to decrease by just percent and remain on our books
that loss would be greater than the current market capitalization of this company
the room goes silent
john tuld looks at peter long and hard
he then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into the city
so what youre telling me mr
sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the biggest bag of stinking shit ever assembled in the history of
everyone looks back at peter
john tuld contd mr
well sir im not sure id put it that way but let me clarify using your analogy what this model shows is the music so to speak just slowing if
the music were to stop as you put it then this model would not be even close to that scenario
it would be considerably worse
well let me tell you something mr
do you want to know why im sitting here in this chair with you all why i get the big bucks so to speak
im here for one reason and one reason only
john tuld continues to look out over the city for a long beat
john tuld contd im here to guess what the music is gonna do a week month a year from now
thats it nothing more
and im afraid
standing here tonight
that i dont hear
the room falls completely still for at least half a minute
then john tuld spins around quickly with a considerably more upbeat tone and looks up and down the table
john tuld contd so now that we know that the music has stopped what can we do about it
john tuld contd mr
robertson im afraid this is where you are supposed to step back in
lord knows we relied enough on mr
jared and sarah come to attention and gather their thoughts
john tuld contd what have you got for us
john tuld contd what have i told you since the first day you walked into my office
pause that there are three ways to make a living in this business
be first be smarter or cheat
well i dont cheat and even though i like to think we have got some pretty smart people in this building of the two remaining options it sure is a
hell of alot easier to just be first
the room goes silent again as mr
tuld stares back out the window
sell it all today
john tuld smiles just a bit
is that even possible sam
sam looks across the room at john tuld they have known each other for years
it is but at what cost
john and sam look and read each other
i think so
almost a trillion bucks of paper
where does it come back to us
sam i dont think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said
if i made you
how would you do it
sam rogers looks down at the table for a long long beat
you bring the traders in for their normal meeting and you be honest with them theyre gonna know its the end either way so youd have to throw them a
bone and a pretty big one
youd have to come out of the gate storming
percent done by and percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven cause by lunch the word will be out
no swaps no nothing and by two oclock youll be getting cents on the dollar if youre lucky and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and
trying to slow us down
he looks to ramesh shah down the table
theyll slow you down but its yours to sell
they cant stop you
lets just say we pull that off which is saying something
the real question is
who are we selling this to
the same people youve been selling this to for the last two years
and whoever else will buy it
they look at each other to see if they understand each other
if you do this youve killed that market for years
and you are selling something you know has no value
cuts him off cold we are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price so that we may survive sam
youll never sell a thing to any one of them again
this is it sam this is it
the rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it
john tuld contd its
jared youve got till to break this down and draw me up a plan
john tuld contd is there anyone else who actually knows whats in there right now block by block
where is eric dale
as of today he is no longer with the firm
we have been trying to locate him
so he is just out there with this information
john tuld looks down the lawyer side of the table to a secret service looking guy
get me eric dale here by
ok meet back here in an hour
everyone stands up and begins to scatter
john tuld contd sam
john tuld leads sam through the back door
they are now alone looking out over the city as the light from the soon to be rising sun is starting to show on the horizon
hell of a town isnt it
never really did it for me actually
always been kinda a grass and tree guy
ive always loved this place
ever since i arrived
everything about it
i cant say i feel that about anyplace actually
are you going to be able to come on board here sam
they look at each other
im not sure john
this is really ugly
you and i are salesmen sam we sell
thats what we do
its not complicated
and you damn well know that you dont make a sale unless you think the guy is gonna come back for more and tomorrow we are done
john looks out and then over at sam and decides whether or not to proceed
this is it sam
you keep saying that what is that supposed to mean
its the big one
most of us arent gonna make it out of this one
what are you talking about
this wont be the last situation i will be having this week
its just the start
its only the start because we are starting it
but i dont think thats true not this time
the numbers just dont add up anymore
well i agree with you there ive been saying that for years
i mean if this kid can come up with this
i dont think i can go in knowing what i know and put the hammer down on these guys like this
oh please when did you become so soft
fuck you soft youre panicking
the word panic slaps john tuld in the face
he then calms
if youre the first one out the door sam its not called panicking john tuld stares aggressively at sam
look i obviously dont have all the information that you do
but i think this could destroy this firm
sam rogers contd youll never be trusted again
you are knowingly putting people out of business
john tuld turns away from sam and heads over to a phone
you let me take care of that
sam heads out the door
sam heads into the hallway where everyone is mingling
he walks over to will peter and seth
howd that go
this is a fucking shit show
they are going to do it
remember this day boys remember this day
sam walks out of the room
an assistant comes into the room
gentlemen there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry
will looks at the guys
seth someone is going to have to get breakfast
and lets face it its you
jared is waiting for the elevator again as sarah walks up and waits with him in silence
there is a housekeeping person standing next to them as well
the doors open and all three get in
so whats the strategy here
thats where im headed right now downstairs to work on it with my guys
no you and i
im not sure we need one sarah
thats not the way ive ever done this
with distinct sarcasm please
he knows where we both have stood on this all along
theres nothing more to do
this pushes a button with her
thats exactly my point and knowing what was discussed by both you and i with him i dont see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense
im not looking for a sense of comfort here sarah
i dont think there is one to be found
the elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off
sarah walks after her but turns to tuld first
so again whats the strategy here
on this particular front im just not sure theres much left to do
sarah looks at him trying to judge the situation
sarah holds the door open
its very simple
dont even think of fucking me on this one because if we are going down
you damn well know its going to be together
jared looks at her for a long beat
no im not sure i do know that
the doors close
will is sitting at his desk with a large plate of food eating
seth and peter are sitting on the couch
seth is stuffing food in his mouth while peter eats nothing
what do you think tuld made last year
would you shut the fuck up
will speaks with food in his mouth
in salary and bonus
yeah its public record
thats a lot of fucking money
he was worth a billion
i think im going to go get a coffee does anyone need anything
slight head shake no
i need a little real air
probably a good idea
will is that alright
if i get out of here for a minute
are you kidding
its not a prison
do you want me to hold your hand
wills phone rings
will stares at it and finally picks it up
we only hear his part of the conversation
will emerson contd will emerson
oh thank you
sam comes to the door of wills office
he looks at everyones faces
that was erics wife
hes alive hes home
he doesnt want to talk to us
and he doesnt know she called me
they all look to sam to see what to do
wheres he live
sam rogers looks at his watch
will emerson contd should we call tulds guy
the last thing we need is those guys going over there you two go try to get him
sam points to will and seth
sam rogers contd but youve got to be back here by
sarah is sitting behind her desk looking down at something
john tuld comes to the door and knocks lightly
she looks up surprised to see him
may i come in
john tuld closes the door and sits in front of her desk
looks around then looks right at her
we are going to do this thing
its going to be tight
is sam on board
john tuld contd sarah i need a head to feed to these traders
and the board
sarah looks up
is it me or cohen
they stare at each other she does not flinch
of course you are well aware i filtered several warnings for you and cohen over a year ago on this
im not sure thats the best path for you to be taking at this point
youre going to be taken care of here
nods obviously its quite complicated
john i was told that in no uncertain terms
it was all a very grey area
it was actually made very clear at the time by you and i and cohen
id really prefer that you didnt fight me on this
tuld pauses they look at each other
john tuld contd we all fucked this one up pretty good
we need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close
theyll go over the numbers with you downstairs
john tuld looks at her
there is a security person standing at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks out
will and seth are sitting waiting for wills car to be brought up
as they wait they see jared cohen come out of the elevator and walk towards them
ah fuck its jared
hes coming this way
what does wonderboy want
will stands up and walks over to jared
do you have a minute
were heading to get eric dale
i just need a second
they walk away from seth
what is it
tuld and i have concerns that sam may not be willing to step up and do the right thing here
will looks around the garage than back at jared
i dont think thats ever been a problem
of course it hasnt but during acute situations such as this often what is right can take on multiple interpretations
they look at each other for a long beat as will sizes up the question
in the background the squeals of tires on concrete are heard
sam will step up
i know he will
but if he doesnt
as the question stands unfinished wills convertible flies into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to jared and will
the attendant gets out and before will has a chance jared hands the attendant a tip
jared then looks back at will who is waiting to get in the car
jared cohen contd contd but if he doesnt we need to know that you will
that i will what
will climbs into the car and shuts the door
he looks at jared through the open window with seth now sitting next to him within earshot
i have no doubt sam will make the right choice
and if it makes you feel any better he and i have always had the same interpretation of whats right
no matter how acute the situation
will puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage leaving jared standing there
the floor is totally empty
slow guitar music playing
the camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer screens
it turns the corner and then finally enters sams office
he is totally asleep
he has headphones on and looks like he could be dead he is so passed out
the music suddenly changes pace and the volume change startles him up
he looks around
he takes the headphones off music stops
he finally stands up and mildly limps his way out the office sam mildly limps down the hallway into the mens room
sam rogers comes across the room and over to the sinks to wash his hands
he looks in the mirror and then decides to wash his face as well
he stares at himself in the mirror
the water drips off his face
he looks old
just then the door opens and john tuld walks into the room
he does not go to use any of the facilities
he stops and looks to talk to there he is
sam walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and face
finally he looks up
sam rogers contd so whats it look like john
the line is delivered a bit too lightly for john tulds liking
cohen has done a nice job
it can work
what does that mean
it means as you very well know that you are a very important piece of this puzzle
they look directly at each other
john tuld contd here
john tuld hands sam a single piece of folded paper
sam opens it and looks at it
thats very generous
its not a gift
i need to know you are with me on this
im with the firm john
john tuld is now taking a far more forceful stance almost blocking the doorway
i wont get what i need out of your boys today unless they believe you
unless they believe in you completely
he stares at sam
john tuld contd are you in
i told you i have my reservations
well you cant have any reservations
they both stare at each other
john tuld contd and i need to know now
sam looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his hand then long and hard at john tuld
im with the firm completely john as i always have been
sam slightly moves john out of the way and then he exits the door closes
there is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings
peter is walking through the streets with mid size headphones on his ears
the music is all we hear
he wanders around the almost completely empty city and the further he walks the less his face changes
peter finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart
he takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops
the wind blows
peter turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him
it is immediately obvious that he knows her
he stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him
they stop in front of each other squarely
its really good to see you
she has a very sweet face but looks tired
she appears to be a bartender or something she is not dressed for banking
you look tired
what are you doing here
i never left work
just had to get out for a walk
youre still working there
this cuts him a bit why wouldnt he be
yes of course
how are you
are you happy
you look happy
well i should get back
hows your father
she is pleasantly surprised by this gesture
thanks for asking
he starts to leave
you got any inside tips for him
this stops peter dead in his tracks
his world tightens yet clarifies
she looks at him with concern as he doesnt even hint at a smile as he says this
they then give a small kiss on the cheek and part
sarah is sitting at her desk staring out the window
she calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes it
then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass wall separating her office from the floor giving herself total privacy
she walks over to her desk and sits down
she reaches over and grabs a box of tissues methodically preparing to cry almost like a surgeon preparing to work
she sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected
her face starts to tweak just a little but it just will not give way
again she tries
she can not cry
she cant believe it
the deeply tragic look of total failure floods her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face
still no tears
finally she makes a forced noise like a sob but it isnt real and she knows it
then she tries to laugh to herself she tries again to laugh but it too is not real
she does feel something but she simply and very sadly can only openly express even to herself
will and seth pull up in front of a very nice large townhouse
they both look up at the house dreading going in
jesus nice place
he just bought it
i hope it was with cash
you are such a prick and it wasnt
i think i should stay here
get out of the fucking car
i just dont think it would be appropriate
get the fuck out of the car
youre probably right
and dont touch any of the fucking buttons
will gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs
he is about to knock on the door when from behind him he hears eric coming walking up the block
he is still in his work clothes and it looks like its been a long night
what are you doing here
peter finished that model you were working on
its created a bit of a shit storm
yeah i bet
do you want to see it
but im pretty sure what it says
do you think hes right
im sure hes right
they both sit down on the stoop
jared cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight
john tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position
eric looks over at will will emerson contd today
erics face doesnt show much emotion
but he is surprised and sincere
well i am very sorry to hear that
they want me to get you back there they are worried about you being out here
with pleasant disgust please
im just saying
cuts him off cold not a chance
will lets it sit for a few beats
this is serious shit eric
you dont think i know that
ive been warning that cunt robertson about this shit since last march
i signed my papers man im out
theyve got nothing on me anymore
eric looks over at will
will lets him know with a look that they mean real money
ive already been paid enough by them
eric looks back out onto the empty street
eric contd did you know i built a bridge once
no i didnt
i was an engineer by trade
it goes from dilles bottom ohio to moundsville west virginia
it spans feet over the ohio river
steel through arch design
people a day use the thing
eric contd it cut out miles each way of extra driving to get from wheeling to new martinsville
thats a combined miles of driving a day
and miles a month and miles a year saved
now erics mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he goes
eric contd i completed that project in
over the life of that one bridge thats billion
thousand miles that havent had to be driven
at lets say
miles an hour thats hours
so that one little bridge has saved the people of those two communities a combined years of their lives not wasted in the car
give or take
one thousand five hundred thirty one years
they sit and let it sink in
thats what i did
you better get back over there
dumping the whole fucking motherload in one day
thanks for stopping by
will looks out down the street as a black towncar comes pulling up to the house
who the fuck is this
id guess its the firms people
tuld doesnt want any loose ends
they fired me will
just come back with them take the bonus and youre home tonight by five
either that or they are going to fight you on everything the package the options
eric drops his head
will walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of erics house
the windows are tinted but they know who it is
will walks around to his car
will emerson contd youre a better man than i
well thats always been true
yes it has
will is about to climb in his car
the house looks great by the way
dont beat yourself up too bad over this shit
who the fuck knows
will emerson contd some people like driving the long way home
he gets in his car and drives away
will and seth are driving slowly towards downtown manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield
there is a long silence and finally
so am i getting fired
i dont know
very long pause then he looks over at seth and decides whether to tell the truth
will emerson contd probably
this clearly hits seth but he recovers quickly
its not personal youre just in the wrong place at the wrong time the young guys are always the first to go
nothing i say is gonna make you feel any better
i get it
seth looks over at will and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city
seth contd contd when did you know this is what you wanted to do
he thinks that through
the first time i made million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day
it was a perfect trade
i saw it coming from three days away
i took my time
i was in i was out
and it was beautiful
how did you learn to do that
im not sure and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow
will looks out again at the city then to seth
will emerson contd contd look man im sorry about this
dont be youre not doing it to me
but im still sorry
at least youll have some decent cash to walk away with
only if we can get this done right
well get it done
im trying to figure that out right now
there arent really enough willing buyers out there right now
im trying to think of every last one of them i can and then ill make them willing
this line sits there for a minute and will looks out onto the city
are you ok with that
im about to completely fuck guys ive been doing business with for fifteen years so no im not exactly ok with it
but look every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second
so it is what it is
and what about everyone else
what are you a socialist
fuck me seth
will looks over at seth sizing him up looking to see if he has what it takes
will emerson contd look if you want to do this with your life and do it well you need to believe that you are necessary
and you are
if people want to live like this
with their big cars and these houses that they havent even paid for
then you are necessary
the only reason they can continue to live like kings is because weve got our fingers on the scale in their favor
and if i were to take my finger off
will emerson contd then the whole world gets really fucking fair really fucking quickly
and no one wants that they say they do
but they dont
they want what were giving them but they also want to play innocent and pretend they have no idea how we get it
and thats more hypocrisy than i can swallow
so fuck em
long look out at the city ahead
will emerson contd and tomorrow if this all goes south theyll crucify us for being reckless but if we are wrong and everything gets back on track
theyll be laughing their arses off at us for being the biggest bunch of pussies that god ever let through the door
he is trying to convince himself as much as seth
they both look out the windows
are we gonna be wrong on this one
will looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above them
theyre all gonna get fucked
peter is still walking around on the street with the music playing
he crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza
as he approaches the building he sees sam rogers standing in front having a cigarette
he walks towards him and then finally decides to take off the headphones
the music stops and the wind kicks in
silence you want one
i dont smoke
but peter holds his place comfortably
i dont much either
its kinda beautiful out right now
they both look out
yeah i guess it is
almost surprised ive never really liked this town much
how long have you been here
i think its beautiful
the whole place
forty years thats something
are you tired
remember i dont work as hard as you do
thats not true
no it is actually
are we all getting fired after today
sam looks out and thinks about it for a while
theyre going to fire you
thats not what theyll call it
itll be a mercy killing really
sam looks at peter
sam rogers contd you dont have to stand out here for me
i dont really want to go back in there just yet
i understand that
i think i know your son
but he always seemed like a nice person
he is a nice person
a taxi honks and flies by
sam rogers contd i guess you could say alot worse about a guy
have you told him whats about to happen
they look at each other to check the nature of the question
what do you mean
this whole thing
i hadnt even thought of it
i guess its illegal anyway
who the fuck knows anymore
and even if it was youd sure as hell never get caught
hes already pretty rich anyway though right
he doesnt need the help
sam rogers laughs quietly
thats very true
he works with a friend of mine
hes a hell of alot richer than me i know that much
but you are taller
its not much
but its something
what did your father do
hes a doctor
now thats something
did he want you to do that
he was always a pretty miserable guy actually
another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building
peter looks up
peter contd theyre all coming in now
yes they are
have you ever done anything like this before
not even close
sam takes a deep drag off his cigarette
peter looks down at his watch then thinks about what to say next
do you really think this is the only
right thing to do
im not sure
now sam looks around and thinks
im not either
so this is gonna make a pretty big mess of it then
i dont even want to think about it
just doesnt quite seem
takes another long drag
very slightly shakes his head
i guess we should get back
they both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn and head into the building
the camera follows them through the long marble lobby
they comfortably dont talk to each other the entire time till they get into the elevator
staring ahead in silence
well good luck you know in the future
seems like youll probably be just fine
the doors open
a very tight shot of seth sitting fully clothed on the toilet with the lid on
he is crying very very intensely but almost silently
he puts his head in his hands and just once or twice lets out a loud noise
eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the person go over to the sink and start running water
seth tries to stop himself from crying
eventually he accepts that the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and walks over to the sinks
jared is standing in front of the mirror with his shirt off shaving
his new shirt and tie are on a hanger next to him
seth walks up to a sink next to him and it is very obvious that he has been crying
he undoes his collar and starts to wash his face
finally jared speaks
seth sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in the mirror
you just fired me
this is all ive ever wanted to do
this hits jared just a touch
i am sorry
jared does up his tie perfectly looks at seth again in the eye
then walks out
sarah robertson is sitting in a club chair staring out the window
the coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of fruit and cheese and pastries
she is not eating
she sits and stares
eventually the door behind her opens and a security guy walks in with eric
they are almost ready for you ms
couple of minutes
security guy leaves the room
eric looks over at sarah then sits in the chair near her
you as well
sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well
long awkward pause
eric looks around for something anything to talk about
eric contd are you still dating that tall guy
from the christmas thing
she looks over at him with a slight smile giving him credit for trying to break the ice
he was very tall
i did pass on your concerns last year
just so you know
it doesnt matter
the door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a cart with another large tray with more food on it
she places it on the table next to the other food
the abundance is overwhelming
sarah robertson contd thank you
the caterer leaves
eric looks around
have they taken all the phones out of this room
sarah nods yes
eric contd jesus
i didnt think they were going to be able to get you back here
eric stands up and goes over to the window
they told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or i come back and make
he looks up and does a little math in his head
an hour to sit in this room quietly
it wasnt much of choice
it never is
eric goes back and sits in the chair
sarah robertson contd obviously looking back the point was expressed with insufficient urgency
sarah robertson contd but your point was passed on
i need you to know that
i understand there was nothing you could do
now sarah questions herself
at the time
it didnt seem like there was much of a choice
it never does
they both look at each other with miniscule smiles then out the windows onto the city defeated
you have kids yeah
long pause as he lets her alone
what is your package going to look like
i dont know thats what im waiting for now
should be pretty good no
it better be
there are young male traders jammed into the conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly with one another
they are oblivious to what is about to happen
eventually sam will jared and a firm lawyer come into the room
everyone quiets down a bit
they go silent as they notice sam standing at the head of the table
jared and the lawyer are standing off in the corner just to observe
sam looks somber
thank you all for coming in a little early this morning i know yesterday was pretty bad i wish i could say that today is going to be less so
but that isnt going to be the case
now i am supposed to read this statement here to you all but how bout you read it on your own time and ill just tell you what the fucks
going on here
the lawyer looks at jared then they look at sam he continues
sam rogers contd i have spent the night here meeting with the executive committee and the decision has been made to begin to unwind a considerable portion of the firms
holdings in several key asset classes
the crux of it is
in the firms thinking the party is over as of this morning
there is going to be considerable turmoil in the markets for the foreseeable future
they believe that it is better to have this turmoil begin with us
as a result the firm has decided to liquidate the majority of its position of fixed income mbs today
an assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the traders in the room
sam rogers contd you should be getting a breakdown right now you will see the accounts you are responsible for today
im sure it hasnt taken you long to understand the implications of this sale on your relationships with your counterparties and as a result on your careers
i have expressed this reality to the executive committee and they understand
as a result if you are able to complete a sale of your assets you will receive a
million dollar one off bonus
sam rogers contd if the floor as a whole is able to achieve a sale we all get an additional
million a piece
because of this if you burn through your allotment by noon get moving around the floor and start picking up other guys leftovers
sam stops for a second and looks around the room
sam rogers contd for those of you who have never been through this before this is what the beginning of a fire sale looks like
i dont have to tell any of you that the first hour and a half is going to be very important
i want you to hit every bite you can find
dealers clients brokers and your mother if shes buying
and obviously no swaps its outgoing only today
this is obviously not the way any of us would like for this to be going down but the ground is shifting below our feet and there appears to be
no other way out
sam looks around the room again person by person and sees that they indeed know what needs to be done
sam rogers contd obviously
this is a very unique situation
if we are successful today we will have been successful in destroying our own jobs
i can not promise that each of you will be repositioned within the firm but i can tell you that i am very proud of the work we have done
together here i have been at this here for years and i know
from experience people are going to say some nasty stuff about what we have done here and what you have devoted a portion of your life to
but have faith that in the greater picture our skills have not been wasted we have accomplished much and our talents have served some greater good
he looks down at the ground then back up around the room
then he walks out
there is a very quiet energy on the floor
a low murmur
then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the ceo john tuld is about to come onto the floor
he appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent
john walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor
he looks around and stands in letting the drama build
then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general
by the end of today almost everyone else in the world including me will have considerably less money than they began the day with
you in this room are the exception
you will leave here today richer
you will fire the first shot i wish it didnt have to be but at times the market must eat its weak and you all
are not the weak
we must strike quick with no doubt if you hear pause on the line attack
by noon the sec is going to be in here getting in your faces sniffing around you let us take care of them and you just keep going
we own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it
years ago this firm was founded today we secure our place for next
youve got two minutes before we get started
lets finish this so we can get on to the next one
john tuld climbs down from the table
sam who is standing off to the side walks along the entire floor slowly and then heads into his office
he shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes almost silent
through the glass you see the trading floor go wild then he walks over to his desk turns around and stares into the four large computer screens as the charts
and graphs begin to move
we just see the back of his head
several actual individual trading sequences throughout the day
the market has closed
sam sits staring at his computers
there is a knock on his door
he turns and as it opens we hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration
he looks up and jared cohen is standing in his doorway
they did alright
i wanted to give you a heads up
they are going to start sending some people home out here
he nods yes sorry
no loose ends
for what its worth youre good
guess somebody upstairs must really like you
sam stands up and walks past jared without another word
he heads down the hallway and passes the heather and lauren bratberg from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people
sam heads off towards the elevator
the room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond
the room is empty except for john tuld sitting at the last table
tuld looks a little surprised to see sam but waves him down
sam please sit
congratulations are clearly in order
our guys did what they could
you did a hell of a job today and i thank you for it
sit excuse me for eating but its been a long day
can i get you anything
no no thanks
they just sit in silence for a long beat as tuld takes a few more bites of his meal
so what can i do for you
i want out
im done i want out
its been a very difficult day for everyone
i need you to release my options that is if theyre still worth anything after today and i need the bonus
youll get the bonus the options and keep your current base but i need you to stay with me for another months
they look at each other sam seems to know its not actually a question
sam is a shell of himself as tuld takes another hearty bite of his meal
he finally looks up
tuld contd for gods sake man put a smile on your face you did some good today you said so yourself
im starting to feel a little better about this whole thing
youre one of the luckiest guys in the world you couldve been digging ditches all these years
sam pushes back his chair stands and prepares to leave
thats true and if i had been at least thered be some holes in the ground to show for it
im just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly
this pushes tuld a bit too far
he also senses he may be losing sam
he drops his fork and his tone changes
jesus when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself its unbearable
what you think we may have helped put some people out of business today
that its all just for naught
well youve been doing that everyday for almost forty years sam
and if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there
its just money its made up a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we dont all kill each other trying to get something to eat
but its not wrong and its certainly not any different today than its ever been
god damn did that motherfucker fuck me up good and whatever this is gonna be called
theyre just the same thing over and over
we cant help ourselves and you and i cant control it stop it slow it or even ever so slightly alter it
we just react
and we get paid well for it if were right
and get left by the side of the road if were wrong
theres always been and theres always gonna be the same percentage of winners and losers happy fucks and sad sacks fat pigs and starving dogs in this world
yes there may be more of us today
but the percentages
they always stay exactly the same
they stare at each other for a long beat and then tuld looks down and takes another bite
he looks up again
ill do it john but not because of your little speech but because i need the money
im not sure how it could possibly be after all these years but i need the money
they both look at each other again then look over and see jared cohen walking down the dining room aisle with peter sullivan next to him
sam rogers contd youre keeping the kid
hes getting promoted
its all hands on deck now sam theres going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess were going to need all the brains
we can get around here
they look at each other one last time then sam starts walking away and as he passes peter he just gives him a slight nod
we hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel
fade up on sam rogers standing in a hole in the backyard digging
next to him is a large black medical looking bag
he continues to dig
eventually the flood lights from the house come on and the whole back yard lights up
then the door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and slippers comes out onto the deck
it is sams ex wife
she squints towards the back of the yard
ive called the police
sam stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel handle
what are you doing
she comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next to the hole
mary rogers contd what are you doing
mary looks down and sees the large canine body bag
tumor on her liver
it was horrible
well im very sorry
i really loved that dog i know but sam you dont live here anymore
i was driving home from the vet and this is the only place i could think to bury her
this is where she belongs
she looks at him deeply
you should have called
are you alright
you look terrible
tough day all around
i heard sammy called
is he alright
he said they got hammered but got out alive
good i was going to call him this morning
well i am going to go back in to bed
the alarm is on so dont try to break in
sam smiles well you take care of yourself
is it alright if i finish up here
mary walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off the lights
sam starts back in digging the ditch and starts humming a song
he keeps digging as the song he is humming then kicks in with the full version
