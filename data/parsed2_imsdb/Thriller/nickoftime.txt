written by ebbe roe smith patrick duncan march union station that gorgeous fifty year old monument to art deco california mission architecture
a sign at one of the departure arrival gates in the main concourse says the san diegan number is due at
set above the gates a big clock six feet in diameter
we see the big hand slam into
a loudspeaker you can just about understand this guy
amtrack the san diegan from san diego del mar
the san diegan pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow grinding stop
san clemente san juan capistrano and irvine is now arriving at gate nine
doors are opened
steps set down
passengers pour out
amtrack will be departing in fifteen minutes from gate nine for oxnard ventura
a man and a woman stand with a view of the arrival doors
hes a blue collar tough guy dressed for church
shes his beefy counterpart
santa barbara lompoc
the guy mr
smith checks his watch
santa maria san luis obispo
then he looks up to the big clock
the minute hand slams into the
and points north
he resets his watch as disembarking passengers pour out of the gate
people run forward with kisses and hugs
they stand like a couple of rocks their eyes scanning the crowd
hates his wife
theyre talking about a couple in their forties
she motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband follows with the suitcases
a couple of teenage boys on rollerblades zip by
i hate rollerblades
a pretty six year old girl lynn who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is climbs down the steps
she reaches the platform looks around
from within the train lynn
gene watson thirtyish a regular joe in appearance and inclination appears above carrying a couple small suitcases
he takes a relieved breath when he sees her
lynn dont walk ahead of me ok
as he comes down the steps im serious honey
dont get out of my sight all right
i want you to stay right by me
will you do that for me
gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh
we made it
lynn nods back
we made it
a security guard approaches the two rollerblading teens
they circle him toss off a few taunts and roll away laughing
smith and ms
jones continue trolling the passengers as they come through the gate
skate boarders i dont mind even though they dress like fuckin idiots but when i see some pin head on rollerblades i get the definite urge to grease the grill
of my car with em
keep your eyes peeled
what about them
theyre talking about a couple in their sixties warmly greeting each other
if you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition
first those blue hairs then some spic
leave this to me
i know people
its my job
im a people person
smith laughs at his joke
what the fuck are you looking for
smith has spotted someone
im looking for them
he starts walking towards the exit gate
gene has emerged with lynn
they pause there getting their bearings
next to them a young couple is kissing
they cant keep their hands off each other
i gotta make a phone call lynn
do you see a phone
lynn has seen the young couple
she secretly points to them covers her mouth and does a tee hee hee number
come on you
they start walking across the concourse towards mr
smith and ms
to lynn havent you ever seen anybody kiss like that
you never saw your mom and me kiss like that
lynn suddenly gets very sad
she looks at the ground slows down
he stops crouches down to her level
smith and ms
jones nearing them split apart move around them and keep going
to lynn hey its ok to talk about her
you can talk about her all you want
you know that dont you
so come on
you never saw us kiss like that
how did you see us kiss
lynn gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss
that little peck of a kiss
oh brother you missed some kisses
lynn laughs and throws herself on her dad
he holds her to him looks to the sky for help
he finds himself staring at the big clock
ooh im gonna be late
i gotta call
smith and ms
jones are making a beeline for their target the young kissing couple
the rollerblading teens almost collide with them
jones wants to do something about it but mr
smith pulls her along
they have a mission to complete
they close in on the couple
look at em
hed do anything for her
the couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses
the words themselves are unclear until mr
smith and ms
jones are only a few feet away
they are speaking french
smith makes an instant one eighty turn
sotto voce foreigners
they copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in kuwait where the fuck are they
smith looks at the partner hes been saddled with
gene has found a pay phone
he keeps an eye on lynn who has wandered a few yards away
hello is mr
i have an interview with him at twelve thirty
conners this is gene watson
sorry to call you at the last minute like this but
he reacts to the rollerblading teens who swoop past lynn one on each side too close for a fathers comfort
lynn come here
he keeps an eye on the teens who having found a victim are circling around passing mr
smith has noticed gene
gene at the phone
theres some crazy kids on skates
listen the train just got in im afraid im going to be a few minutes late
the teens make their pass flip him the bird engage in other objectionable behavior begin to circle again
smith watches gene watch the teens then notice a sturdy sand filled ashtray next to him
ok ill get there as soon as i can
he hangs up
keeping one eye on the circling teens
to lynn ready
let s do it
he picks up a suit case and accidently on purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray just as the teens approach
the ashtray spills its load of sand into their path
when they hit it their skates stop they dont
they sprawl doing nasty things to knees and wrists
he stands over them with lynn
now see this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads
you never know when youre going to fall down and go boom
he starts forward
not so sure perfect
they intercept gene
smith flashes a badge
could i see some identification sir
ditto with the badge i
could we see some
whats whats the problem
will a drivers license do
thatll do just fine
gene pulls out his wallet surprised and confused
smith looks at it
is this about those kids
look im sorry about that
but they darn near
youre from santa maria mr
near lompoc north
come with us sir
id like to know what
dont cause a ruckus sir
he pulls open his coat putting his hands on his hips not so coincidentally revealing the butt of a holstered gun
you dont want to cause a ruckus with the little girl and all
come with me honey
jones swoops lynn up and heads for the station entrance
ill take the girl
ill take the girl
shes good with kids
gene hurries after ms
smith grabs up the suitcases
jones nears a souvenir stand
the owner is looking the other way
without breaking stride ms
jones reaches out snatches a childs coloring book and crayons
you stole that
no i didnt
i confiscated it
theres a difference
and theyre out the door gene hurrying after
the big hand on the big clock moves
jones heads for a van with smoked windows
she gets inside with lynn
gene stops a few feet away
what is going on
smith prods him in the ribs
into the van mr
gene looks desperately around for help
there is none
he lets mr
smith push him toward the van
lynn and ms
jones are in the back
lets get your seatbelt on
always gotta wear your seatbelt isnt that right
i want my daddy
gene climbs into the front passenger seat
theres your daddy
were your daddys friends
smith climbs into the drivers seat
the policeman is your friend
isnt that right daddy
gene looks down
smith has pulled his gun
he points it casually so its aiming through the seat in the general direction of the little girl
its ok lynn
these are our friends
hey would you look at this crazy car
everybody has their own radio
what do you think of that
and you can listen to it without anybody else listening
lets try it out
she puts some ear phones on her
she holds up the plug in end
this is what they call the jack
it goes in that little hole
let me do it
she plugs the jack in
jones turns on the radio
lynn gets a big smile on her face
loudly its loud
she goes to work playing with the radio changing stations etc
oblivious to all else
removes a pro label machine from under the seat
she begins to type in several characters
lets get down to business
who are you
youre not the police
ms jones presses print on the labeller
a strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a name tag
he looks back to her
smith whacks him on the knee with the gun
pay attention mr
pay attention and your daughter wont be hurt
he looks back
she is caressing lynns hair
get your hands off her
he makes a move
smith whacks his knee again harder
watson youre not paying attention
your daughters life depends on you
do you understand that
gene looks from mr
smith to ms
jones and back
hes having a hard time focussing
she slips the nametag into a manila envelope beside her mr
smith do you understand
yes yes i understand
he takes the manila envelope from ms jones tosses it in genes lap
this is for you
in it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary
it is her itinerary
she is presently are you listening mr
yes im listening
she is presently at the bonaventure hotel
thats right near here
the glassy bonaventure hotel is glimpsed surrounded by taller newer high rises
when you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the bonaventure hotel
then you will take this
smith holds up his hand snaps his fingers
from the back ms
jones hands him a cloth wrapped bundle
he puts it in genes hand shows him what it is a gun
and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there
not just shoot her mind
id recommend you empty the gun into her
got all that
it takes a moment for it all to sink into genes brain
youre out of your mind
whats your point
i will do no such thing
yes you will mr
from the back seat
jones has broken a carrot stick
she breaks another
well take good care of the kid
she gives half the carrot stick to lynn pops the other half in her mouth and grinds it to pulp
smith is checking his watch
it is now
if the woman in the picture is alive at
holds up a walkie talkie i call my partner your daughter is dead
he looks in the rear view mirror to ms
and what happens if i dont call you
i kill her anyway
did you hear that mr
do you understand
he taps the manila envelope
the woman in the picture
he indicates the back seat with his head
or your daughter
gene looks at his daughter
oh my god
smith reaches over puts the gun and manila envelope into genes pockets
god cant help her mr
only you can help her
youre wasting time
he reaches across gene opens the door and pushes him out then follows him
lynn takes off the ear phones tries to undo her seatbelt
where is my daddy going
jones wraps a big arm around her
hes going to help the police
your daddy is going to be a hero
my daddy is going to be a hero
like power rangers
just like power rangers
smith activates the walkie talkie speaks into it
lets test this thing
he holds it up for gene to hear
filtered reading you
smith still has genes wallet
he opens it pulls out some cash puts it in genes breast pocket
you need some cash
re the wallet ill hang onto this for the time being
he grabs one of genes hands
youll need these
he dumps six bullets into genes palm from a cloth chivas regal bag
get moving mr
times a wastin
gene just stands there transfixed by the bullets in his hand
smith reaches out turns him around and gives him a shove away from the van and into the midst of
a large crowd of tourists that have just exited an arriving mini bus
gene is caught up in the crowd and carried along like a leaf in a stream
amid the chattering crowd gene is pushed along as if in a trance
he touches the pocket with the gun
he looks at the bullets in his hand then at the people around him
its like a splash of cold water
he quickly pockets the bullets turns and pushes against the tide of tourists
they resist him pushing him along until he breaks free and can see
the van is gone
he stands there a lost man
fear sweeps over him
he looks desperately around
he is within himself oblivious to his surroundings his mind racing his face a tangle of emotions
he is a man alone in a crowd
he takes a step
a little latino girl chased by her brother runs into genes legs
he instinctively grabs her before she can fall finds himself crouched down holding her by the arms
his heart plunges she isnt lynn
his intensity scares her
she pulls away flees to her mother who hoists her up reprimanding her in spanish
gene stays crouched watching the little girl staring at him over her mothers shoulder
until a cop crosses his line of sight
a los angeles transit policeman foot patrolling the station
its like a gift from above
relief floods genes face
he is saved
he stands hurries toward the cop each step more confident
then just beyond the cop mr
smith casually slides into view pointedly holding the walkie talkie
gene walks right past the cop heading towards a cab stand
smith falls in behind him speaking in his ear
you talk to a cop you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead
into walkie talkie do it
filtered go ahead sugar die
filtered lynn calling daddy
lynn calling daddy
come in daddy
gene grabs at the walkie talkie like a drowning man
filtered i can hear you good
can you hear me
yes i can hear you
filtered daddy has to go now
filtered he has to say over and out
daddy you have to say over and out
over and out
smith clicks off the walkie talkie
look at your watch
look at it
at one thirty your little girl is dead
say it with me
at one thirty my little girl is dead
softly at one thirty my little girl is dead
unless you do what youre told
go do it
he pushes gene on toward a cab
and dont forget ill be watching you
gene looks back at him full of impotent rage
smith raises the walkie talkie
gene reaches the first cab at the stand
the cabbie talking to another driver throws away his cigarette ambles over to the driverside of the cab
where to sir
the bonaventure hotel
do you know where that is
the cabbie is disappointed but he nods and gene gets into the cab
the cabbie gets in and they take off
gene stares at the manila envelope in his hand
he starts to open it is stopped by amtrack
you just come in on amtrack
business or pleasure
whered you come from
oh san diego
ive thought about moving to san diego
its hard to make a living in this town
these short hops
cant make a dime on em
to lax pasadena then i can make a buck
these little hops cost me money
what do you think
better in san diego
more opportunity there
i really dont know
i dont live there
i was just visiting
aw too bad
they lapse into silence
gene starts to open the envelope again
we were separated
she was thinking about a divorce
gene notices the dashboard clock gene leans forward
ive got a problem
a big problem
he hits the horn and swerves to the left
watch it buddy
gene looks out his window and finds himself staring at mr
smith staring back at him driving the van next to him
he throws himself back in the seat
the cab pulls into the drive front of the bonaventure hotel and stops
id love to hear about your problem but the rides over
gene looks out the back window watches the van pulls up to the curb on the other side of the street
i hope your problem doesnt have anything to do with my three fifty
gene looks back at the cabbie waiting for his fare
gene digs through his pockets and comes up with one of his business cards
he hurriedly writes on it help
van kidnap child
he wraps a five around it pushes it into the cabbies hand gives him a meaningful look and gets out of the cab
gene stops a few yards from the cab watching the cabbie
the cabbie finds the secreted card but looks at the wrong side
what do i want with an accountant
a doorman leans down at the window
i got one for the airport
the doorman plants a passenger in the cab
as he pulls away the cabbie again glances at the business card crumples it up
gene watches the cab leave
as it exits the cabbies arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash
gene knows what it is
he looks around
valets bellmen arrivals and departees cars coming and going
no one pays particular attention to him
gene looks at the van across the street
smith gets out and walks across the street towards him
the van drives away
gene watches the van disappear around the corner desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it
smith takes the walkie talkie out of his pocket
gene goes into the hotel
its like another world
a busy humming air conditioned planet
people hustle around the restaurants waterfalls a definite ant farm ambiance
suddenly we have cut to a video image of gene looking around this hotel complete with scrolling time and date
shot by someone high above
gene is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd
he breaks free to a clear spot looks up and freezes
then he starts tracking all around him seeing
oh my god
he desperately fumbles in his pocket
facing and above him some workmen on ladders are securing a huge rolled up banner
gene finds what hes looking for the manila envelope
he rips it open
as he pulls out the photograph that is inside the workmen let their banner unfurl
we do a simultaneous reveal
the woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner
written across the bottom of it in your best red white and blue and an addendum oh shit
it dawns on him
he looks around him again
this time we see what he sees
campaign posters and banners everywhere
on some of them she is posed with a handsome man several years her junior
these have the caption governor grant and husband brendan
oh sweet jesus
his eyes fall on mr
smith standing inside the entrance walkie talkie in hand watching him
gene looks at a poster at mr
smith who smiles nods and gives gene a move of the head get to it
gene shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him then slides out the itinerary
the itinerary says california educators association noon emerald bay room opening address governor eleanor samara grant
gene checks his watch
he looks around him at the confusion and spots a bellboy gustino whos cleaning out ashtrays
could you tell me where the emerald bay room is
gustino points up
follow the signs
gene turns away without a word starts to walk then turns back
thanks a lot
gene mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor
smith follows him as he climbs
the whole lobby and entrance of the hotel are seen as gene ascends
gene forces himself not to look at mr
smith behind him
his nerves are rising in anticipation of his destination
gene sees the arrow and sign for the emerald bay room
he walks that way
gene and mr
smith pass gift shops snack bars
the walkway is crowded and gene is going against the tide of reporters politicians supporters and just a lot of people with name gene plows on through
and runs smack into brendan grant
the two men reel back from each other
a security man earphones and gray suit steps immediately between them
brendan grant is a charmingly smooth man
nice body check
he continues on talking to an attractive wcman companion
brendan grant what the governor really admires mrs
wentzel and eleanor has said this to me on more than one occasion are pecple like you who take a personal tragedy and turn it into a positive force
he slides a familiar hand around her waist
you know my wife has a deeply personal reason for going after repeat drunk drivers
they are felons and they should be treated as such
a drivers license is a privilege not a right
and he is hustled away
right past an election poster featuring him and governor grant
still stunned by the encounter gene turns back and watches the governors husband but keeps walking
it is emptying thats where the crowd came from
gene comes in
a woman is heading for the door with a centerpiece shes just copped
excuse me is the
you didnt miss much
eleanor grant is gone
but its the same at all these
but gene has turned away
the woman gives him a face grabs another centerpiece and exits
a clean up crew is starting to go through the room
gene leans against a wall breathing through a combination of relief and agony
smith is suddenly next to him
check your itinerary
gene gets out the itinerary
hors doeuvres buffet w friends of eleanor samara grant invitation only bona vista lounge
this says invitation only
of course youre invited
youre a big donor to the campaign
they love you
mr smith digs into the manila envelope comes out with a handful of security badges name tags invites
he plucks the name tag that ms jones printed earlier
it has a red ribbon signifying a major donor to the campaign
he fastens it to genes lapel
this get you in anywhere
thirty fifth floor
where did you get these
who are you
im the guy whos going to kill your daughter if you dont get moving
he notices a flurry of movement a small group of people moving determinedly through the lobby
it is governor eleanor grant with a small entourage
she is a handsome woman in her fifties
the entourage consists of krista brooks eleanors late twenties assistant a few assorted political aides and a couple of people with name tags
gene is not sure what to do
the group reaches the elevator
krista pushes the button
they didnt hear a word i said
the mike was too low on the podium
how much did we pay for that room
krista turns to an aide
a have nolin pre check the pa systems
the elevator doors open
they crowd in
the doors start to close
gene looks around where did mr
gene springs forward thrusts his hand between them
the doors stop then bounce open
gene is startled finding himself face to face with a cold eyed bodyguard
excuse me sir this car is for the governor
you can take the next one
dont you dare franco
this is one of our biggest supporters
she smiles charmingly offers her hand to gene
eleanor grant gubernatorial incumbent
thats a mouthful isnt it
i love saying that
gene steps aboard shakes her hand
the elevator begins to rise
whose idea was it to have a lunch right after the brunch
im about to bust as it is
well just walk through do a little grip and grin then get ready for the press con
we are on the third floor
the doors have closed and the elevator begins to rise
it comes out a little louder then he intended
he has turned his back to the door
everyone looks at him
i need your help
what can i do for you mr
about my daughter
the elevator slows and stops on the next floor above
we are on the fourth floor
behind gene the doors open
room for one more
i think we can accommodate you
she offers her hand to mr
smith as he steps on board
eleanor grant gubernatorial incumbent
a pleasure to meet you governor
the car begins to rise again
grant turns back to you were saying
what to do now
wanted me to
be sure to get your autograph
i wish everything were that easy
ive got the pen if youve got the paper
gene looks at her
she smiles back
how about that
he looks at what she refers to the manila envelope he holds the one mr
smith gave him
is that something precious
thats fine he gives it to eleanor grant
krista hands over the pen
genes eyes flick over to mr
smith who is staring at the envelope
whats her name
gene looks at the governor only inches away back to mr
smith who raises his eyes nods his silent message curt do it
gene pulls his eyes away
her name is lynn
eleanor grant writes the autograph
smiths eyes drill into him
gene looks over
smith raises a hand to his face pretends to scratch an itch
his other hand taps his wristwatch
genes hand slides toward his jacket pocket
sweat beads on his forehead
hes barely aware of krista talking to him
i dont even keep a pad of paper with me anymore everythings gone so electronic
he gives her a quick weak smile
his free hand wipes the sweat from his face
if it wasnt for double a batteries id be in big trouble
he is slowly reaching into the pocket with the gun but stops when he notices mr
smiths hand slide into his jacket where his gun is
he looks at the other mr
smith earphone crewcut security
there is the hint of a gun on his hip
genes eyes widen dart to mr
smiths face his hand sliding into his coat
his hand hovers over his gun trembling
is the security man staring at him
eleanor grant hands over the autograph
are you all right
elevators make me queasy too
gene gives her a sick smile abruptly turns away
he takes his hand out of his pocket
he clenches it to stop the shakes
the doors open startling him
eleanor grant and her entourage exit to greetings and applause
gene stays in the elevator frozen alone with mr
the doors close and the elevator descends
smith is fuming his face red
she was right in front of you
whats wrong with you
his fists clench
he seems about to lose control
he backs gene into a corner physically terrified
are you fucking with me
what about the gun
it wasnt loaded
i didnt put the bullets in it
he raises a fist
struggles with the impulse to smash gene controls it
angrily he takes the gun from genes pocket expertly loads it with bullets from his own pocket
you wont get many chances like that mr
thats the way life works
dont blow the next one
he indicates the glass wall of the elevator with his eyes
gene looks out and down
its moving into a parking spot across from the bonaventure on flower street
lynn is coloring a picture in her stolen book
jones takes a look
thats pretty good
ive done much better ones than this
you have huh
ill show you
i have much more colors at home
checks her watch thats good sweetie pie
the elevator continues its descent and the van disappears from view
gene strains to see it again but its impossible
smith jams the loaded gun into genes pocket
there all loaded
ready for the hunt
the elevator doors open into the lobby
smith walks out
smith suddenly becomes self conscious walks away from gene
the object of his shyness a japanese tourist couple nearby
the man is taping his wife with a video camera
we see what the camera is seeing the wife smiling
behind her we see gene looking confusedly after mr
he turns walks out of frame
in the corner of the picture a read out of the time
back in real life gene walks toward a shoeshine stand outside the mens room
hueys polished act and below that hand lettered disabled veteran where huey himself a fiftyish black man reads a smithsonian magazine
he sees gene and perks up a customer
having a rough day
down at the heels as they
but gene goes right past huey and into the mens room
calling after him you dont see your face you dont pay
huey gives up goes back to his magazine
gene goes over to one of the sinks runs the cold water splashes his face looks in the mirror into his own eyes
he tries to find an answer a way out
a pay phone on the wall behind him comes into focus
then a hand reaches in grabs the receiver
and yanks it snapping the wire
gene spins around
it is mr
smith of course
gene exits the mens room and walks back the route he came
huey sets down his magazine again
having a rough day
down at the heels as they say
what you need is a shoe shine shoe shine shoe shine today
its hueys usual patter hes said it a thousand times
gene looks around
smith is in the lounge area facing the flower street entrance able to keep the mens room and gene in view
take ten take a break take a seat take a load off
put the world in perspective
gene lets huey usher him into a chair
the gun in his jacket pocket clunks against the arm of the chair
a grim reminder
he pulls out the itinerary
governor eleanor samara grant pacific rim multi cultural conference pool deck fourth floor gene looks at his watch
the minute hand clicks to as he watches
he works away at genes shoes
so are you a visitor or lucky enough to live in the city of angels
its more of hueys patter no real substance to the inquiry
gene watches mr
smith frown and amble toward the shoeshine stand
what do you do if i may be so bold
looking at mr
smith im just an accountant
dont denigrate yourself my friend
where would the government be without accountants
they wouldnt know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop isnt that right
he takes note of the conversation and wanders back to his chair
now you take tips
time was a tip was between a man and his customer
not any more
theyve figured out what they call a formulae dont laugh it aint for babies
they take your sales see and slap a percentile on there figuring that somewhere between your lies and your bad luck theyll hit on the mean amount mean meaning in
the middle but if you ask me it means just plain mean
why you can have uncle scrooge wring a nickel over your poor out stretched palm or daddy warbucks dropping pearl stick pins like manna from heaven dont make no difference
theyll tax your behind according to that same figure
doesnt seem quite right
no it doesnt
the bellboy gustino walks by calls out to huey
hey huey hows it hangin
its a load my friend but somebodys got to carry it
gustino laughs waves
i have to do something
you have to speak up
taps his ear im a little deaf in this ear
between that and my wooden leg im a mess
compliments of the united states army artillery corps
i said i have to do something
ill have you out of here in two shakes of a lambs tail
is within himself
gene i keep wondering what she would do if she was here
shed figure it out
shed run it down like a column of numbers
pros and cons
thats the way she was lists all over the house
hueys manic shoe shining slows down who has he got in his chair
drove me crazy
there must have been one on me
i didnt add up so she left
thats what attracted me to her in the first place
she made up her mind and she did it
she wouldnt sit around waiting for
shed do something
shed do something
huey keeps his eyes on his work
hes afraid hes got a live one
yes well you know for a quality shoe you cant beat a good wingtip
wears like iron
youre a wise man
there ya go
huey gestures for gene to get down
gene steps to the floor
he pays huey with a twenty
you got anything smaller
its a twenty
gene is thinking about something
gene looks around the lobby at mr
smith the flower street entrance the rest of the area feeling the gun in his pocket
can i get out to flower street from here
go down past the bar
take you right out there
huey nods toward the bar
gene walks toward the bar
huey shakes his head time for the boys in white
gene looks towards the flower street entrance
the van is still there
a bus pulls up
gene walks past mr
you get another chance in ten minutes
then i have time for a drink
he heads up to the bar
all right mr
watson but make it just one
i dont want you
but gene is long gone
gene walks into the area of the bar
the bartender is just returning to chat with a customer a reporter who is getting sloshed
gene moves slowly along the bar into an area where mr
smiths view of him is blocked
so where was i
i dont know
something about the governors new regime
gene hears this and glances towards them
shes dumping the good old boys like yesterdays newspapers
gene sees that mr
smith can no longer see him
he scans the lobby sees a smaller door that leads onto flower street
the white boys are in for it
when they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the governors office look like the united nations
the bartender laughs
gene quickly cuts across the lobby and out the smaller door onto flower street
were talking custers last stand here
the only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the rain forest
gene comes out the door dashes across the street weaving through the traffic
once across he heads up the sidewalk toward the van keeping low sneaking up behind it
he crouches by the front door one hand sliding into his pocket for the gun the other on the door handle
he raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab
jones up front at least
he takes a breath braces himself
with one motion he jerks the back door open yanks out the gun
the first thing he sees fixates on is lynn
she is stretched out on the seat eyes closed mouth open
she appears dead
a gasp lynn
youll wake the baby up
jones is sitting on the seat behind the one lynn is on
gene points the gun at her face
softly what we have here is what they call a mexican standoff
the thing you gotta ask yourself is whats behind the seat
now a twenty twod go right through it but even a button will throw a twenty two off so theres a good chance itd get screwed up somewhere along the
way miss the target
maybe a thirty eight
a thirty eight drill pretty straight unless it hits metal then itll bust up in little bitty pieces
theyll keep going but theyll be slowed down quite a bit
hows about a three fifty seven
itll go through the seat her you the dashboard shit itll go through the engine block before it knows its hit anything end up in some pedestrian three blocks away
what do you think
whats my poison
gene look at lynns sleeping face the gun in his own hand
he lowers the gun defeated
well its a comfort to know youve got the co jones to pull that thing out
whether youve got the balls to pull the trigger weve still got to see
gene climbs out of the van shuts the door leans there
the gall of his defeat is hard to swallow
he realizes hes holding the gun hurriedly tucks it away
jones puts her gun down raises a walkie talkie
into the walkie talkie hes coming back in
filtered ive got him in the crosshairs
smith near the entrance eating some food
he watches gene walk past him
their eyes meet
gene looks at his watch then checks the itinerary once more
governor eleanor samara grant pacific kim multi cultural conference pool deck fourth floor gene addresses another bellboy hector who is moving luggage out to the street
take that escalator
gene thanks him and moves across the lobby mr
smith follows gene heads toward the escalators
ahead of him he sees eleanor grant and brendan grant surrounded by aides and security men facing a crowd of press people
the governor and her husband have an arm around each other
they are smiling relaxed quite the happy couple
they give each other a warm kiss
camera flashes recording the moment
gene heading toward them has to thread his way through a large wedding party tuxedos and bridesmaid gowns
when he clears them he has neared the impromptu press conference
he is now alone in front of a campaign poster fielding questions from a few remaining reporters
farther on eleanor grant and her entourage can be seen taking the escalator up
gene heads that way passing brendan grant
my wife is not interested in negative campaigning
she wants to accentuate the positive
i dont know about you but i find that refreshing
have you ever thought of running for office yourself
smiles charmingly me
a pretty young woman walks by
the governors husbands eyes follow her appreciatively as he says im just a business man
he nears the escalator
its crowded and gene is pulled into the midst of news people tv radio press
he joins the flow and lets it pull him along
gene rides the escalator to the second floor and follows the crowd up two flights of the circular stairs
down a short tunnel and out onto the pool deck
about an acre of grass on the fourth floor
skyways connect the pool deck to the office buildings across flower and figueroa
a platform has been set up with chairs and microphones in front of a podium
gene blinks in the sudden bright sunshine
when his eyes adjust he finds himself in a line that is approaching a security man with a hand held metal detector
he panics turns trying to escape but finds himself bumped along trapped
the line shuffles forward
he turns determined to make a supreme effort to escape and finds himself facing a nd security man who waves him to one side
nd security man excuse me sir you dont have to wait
i can take you over here
gene is dragged forward
he looks around no way out
he stands expectant as the detector slides down one side of his body is lifted over to the other
down it slides toward the pocket concealing the gun
gene waits for the alarm which doesnt come
the security man operating the gizmo deftly switches it off as it passes the weapon
gene is pushed on looking back confused alarmed finds himself among press by the dozens
eleanor samara grant supporters by the hundreds
security men and cops in uniform
gene moves through them trying to figure out what just happened
he glances back to the nd security man and bumps into one particular police officer plain clothes badge in pocket who reacts with a quick laugh
police officer easy sir
got to watch where youre going in a crowd like this
he is a handsome solid looking guy
youd trust him
call him officer trust
officer trust seems to be in charge
he moves off through the crowd giving local police orders in an easy way
gene looks around
he cant see mr
he edges his way after officer trust who reaches the wall beyond which is the drop to the street
he leans there comfortably scanning the crowd gene reaches the wall a few yards away from him
he looks out at the city getting his courage up
just as he turns to approach officer trust i know what youre thinking
smith appears from the crowd joins him
he smugly flips his walkie talkie into the air catches it
what would you do in my place
he flips the walkie talkie catches it
the bitch would be dead
course i aint sayin which bitch
he flips the walkie talkie
gene lashes out smacks the walkie talkie
it sails over the edge falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below
smith goes ballistic
gene walks away from him right up to officer trust
theres a plot to kill the governor
if you dont believe me check that guy right there
he has a gun
officer trust looks at mr
smith and then at gene
so do you mr
and officer trust reaches in his hip pocket for a spare walkie talkie that he tosses to mr
you got this under control
it doesnt look like it
its under control
it better be
officer trust walks away
smith stares at a devastated gene
he sticks the walkie talkie into his pocket grabs gene under the arm drags him to an isolated corner
i oughta throw you after that walkie talkie but im going to give you a break because youre an amateur
the waiter offers a tray of hors dhouvres
have a cracker
gene shakes his head
have a cracker mr
gene woodenly takes one
the waiter moves on
there was this guy
red faced black haired jolly son of a bitch
we see them from a distance just a couple guys chatting
nobody could make me laugh like him
we closed more bars together than i can count
he was my pal
i loved that crazy mick im not ashamed to say it
but he was fuck up
he had this image of himself
thought he was con man
always trying to shave the edge
nickel and dime
ill always miss him
tell me why
tell me why i miss him
tell me why
how should i
tell me why hes dead
gene stares at him for a beat
you killed him
thats right i killed him
he fucked up one too many times so i put a bullet in his eye
then i put two more into him just to make sure
now that was somebody i loved
he moves in on gene crowding him
he breathes hard looks like one insane piece of work
i loved that motherfucker but i got the call and i put him down like a sick animal
so if youve got any doubts about whats going to happen if you dont deliver let me tell you something
id make gravy out of your little girl just to season that black irish cocksuckers meat
a wave of applause catches their attention
she and her entourage enter the pool deck and walk toward the platform
eleanor grant gladhands people on the way
he turns back to gene
do what youre supposed to do
do it now
he grabs gene and gives him a push
there is a general movement in the crowd toward the platform
gene is buffeted along
smith follows him keeping him in sight but then a pack of photographers move in start snapping lifting their cameras high to shoot over the crowd
smith instinctively turns away hiding his face
he moves around the photogs and finds himself separated from gene by the mob
he searches trying to spot him
in the crowd gene is bumped this way and that
his face displays an inner devastation
his eyes focus desperately on something ahead it is the back of eleanor grants head
she is turning this way and that greeting supporters
genes hand slides into his pocket grips the gun
he is at the end of his rope
he is going to do it
a local politico mounts the platform taps the microphone
local politico can i have your attention please
please welcome a man who was for years the distinguished mayor of los angeles
the honorable tom bradley
the crowd reacts loudly yells and whistles
gene pushes his way forward
it is my extreme pleasure this afternoon to introduce to you
he is now a few yards from eleanor grant
he comes up against the security man who gave him the once over with the metal detector
the mans eyes slide over him then he looks away
he nonchalantly steps aside moves off through the crowd
a woman who can only be characterized as a one of a kind
gene is close to eleanor grant
she is just a few bodies away visible between them
his hand moves in his pocket
the impulse sweeps over him and
krista brooks the young woman from the elevator is next to him smiling
he looks at her in confusion
an iconoclast with class
you werent feeling well
gene looks at eleanor grant
a genuine lady whos not afraid to get into the trenches
are you better now
gene turns scans the crowd no sign of mr
and go to the mat with greedy special interests
gene looks at krista studies her intensely
shes a bit unnerved
the finest governor our state has ever had
again gene looks at eleanor grant
shes turning around facing the crowd facing him
my friend and yours governor eleanor grant
eleanor grant raises her arms
a perfect target
the crowd roars as gene turns back to krista
he leans into her speaks
my wife always said i had a problem trusting people
well you can trust eleanor samara grant
you dont understand
im going to trust you
and you have to trust me
krista looks at gene
yes youre right i dont understand
shes going to die
unless you can help me
krista assesses gene his desperate tone of voice
obviously a nut case
a well dressed nut case but a nut case nevertheless
krista nervous looks around for help
sure sure ill help you
let me get mr
im sure he can assist you hes our
gene pulls the gun holding it in kristas sight only unnoticed by anyone else
sotto voce no
you have to listen to me
krista stares wide eyed at the gun at gene
im listening im listening
eleanor grant takes over the microphone from the beaming my friends my good friends
gene and krista are gone
hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the crowd gene confronts krista covering her with the pocketed gun
in the background eleanor grant delivers a ringing speech accented with applause
you have to believe me
they have my daughter
they want me to kill eleanor grant or theyll kill my daughter
krista tries to edge away
all right lets just
lets get security in on this
theyre in on it
i dont see how they could be in on it
theyre the best
theyre hand picked
i dont know
one of them is following me
if he knew what id just told you theyd
gene pulls the gun from his pocket
she recoils thinking hes going to shoot her
look how did i get in here with this
krista stares at the gun
she cant deny the fact
i dont know
youve got to trust me
im putting my daughters life in your hands
shes only six
shes just a little girl
please please trust me
its a little hard to trust you under the circumstances
gene looks at her intently
youre right it is
gene offers krista the gun
she is surprised to say the least
she takes it gingerly with only the tips of her fingers
will you trust me now
she stares at the gun at the strange man
i guess ill have to
come on theres one person we can go to
the man following me has a walkie talkie
if he sees im not here hell call his partner
i do anything out of line and hell send the word to kill my daughter
hell think youre in the crowd until the end of the speech
wait a minute
she steps closer to the platform listens
eleanor grants voice is heard
i remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday
a phone call pulling me out of sleep the terrible news
krista checks her watch
my husband and child senselessly killed by a drunk driver
weve got about ten minutes
are you sure
ive heard this speech a lot
well take care of him
you asked me for help
let me help
she starts to lead him away
he stops her points to the gun she still holds
i think you better put that away
i think youre right
she pulls out a handkerchief covers the gun and tucks it out of sight as she leads him behind the platform and away
smith still roams the crowd looking for gene
but tragedy if it doesnt destroy us has a curious way of giving us strength
he sees officer trust who gives him a questioning look
he ignores it
i doubt if i would be before you now if i hadnt been put through that crucible of loss
mr smith notices the japanese tourist couple we met before
the man has the video camera pointed at a sharp up angle
smith glances up toward what the man is shooting
consternation and anger fill his face
what he sees is one of the exterior elevators rising
krista stands at the glass looking down
behind her just glimpsed is gene
and though i can never forget william and bill junior or the love i felt for them
smith cuts a wake through the crowd
i have found joy again in serving this great state
i have found love again in my second husband brendan
the elevator doors open
gene and krista bolt out and hurry down the hall
where are we going
krista leads gene past the security guard stationed in the hallway at a small table
gene tries to keep his face turned away
the guard glances up
is he in
they walk past him
hes a bit curious about gene but shrugs it off
gene and krista reach a door and knock
who is this
are you sure we can trust him
its her husband
hes her campaign manager
the door opens
brendan grant is framed there
what is it
is there a problem
we need to see you brendan
she grabs gene and pushes inside
brendan grants coat is draped on a chair
krista moves past him pulling gene
to krista we have to hurry
brendan listen to me
someone is trying to kill eleanor
what are you talking about
we need people we can trust
we only have a few moments
this is insane
how do you know this
i know it because im the one whos supposed to kill her
to krista you brought this man here
you brought this man to my room
i had to
her security people may be involved
there is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom
the door opens and a man emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel
he is late middle aged white mild looking perhaps wearing glasses
is there a problem brendan
there certainly is
this man says hes been hired to kill eleanor
theyre blackmailing me
who is this they
i dont know
they have my daughter
im not some lunatic
your wife is in trouble
someone is trying to kill her
someone is trying to make me kill her
and on the strength of this story you bring this man to brendans suite
does that show good judgment ms
im just a friend of brendans but it seems to me
he brought a gun onto the pool deck
he got onto the pool deck with a gun
how did he get past her security carrying a i see
where is this gun
well is it real
do we know anything about it
it looks real
i dont know anything about guns
could i see it
krista gets out the gun wrapped in the handkerchief hands it to him
it lays in the palm of his hand
he unwraps it awkwardly examines it
it certainly looks real
he looks beyond them towards the entrance to the suite
whats your opinion
youre the expert in these matters supposedly
gene turns to see who he is talking to
smith stands by the open door
before gene can speak mr
it is fluid and cohtroled and fast
he marches across the room detouring to grab a pillow from the couch
he takes the gun shoves it into the pillow and goes face to face with krista
she just has time to wonder what is going on there is a double muffled gunshot
shock fills her eyes she slides to the floor
gene can only stand there unbelieving freaked to the gills
calmly staring at yeah id say its real
are you out of your fucking mind
the door opens
officer trust slides in quickly
somebody mind telling me
sees kristas body what the hell happened
help me get her off the rug
officer trust checks the hall shuts the door
they begin to drag her body to the bathroom
the mystery man watches
what have you done to me
genes eyes follow them
as if rousing from a sleep he comes to life
he tries to rush to the bathroom but mr
smith is right there gripping him
gene struggles frantically uselessly watching the bathroom door close
smith is beyond anger
he grabs genes throat muscles down
gene grips the iron hand thats cutting off his air
you fucked up
the mystery man grabs mr
smiths arm tries to pry him loose
smith is beyond reason
you want me to kill your kid
you want me to kill you
genes eyes begin to roll back in his head
everything begins fading to black
the blackness retreats in a rush and gene finds himself staring at the butt of mr
smiths gun visible under his coat
he reaches for it yanks it out fires point blank into mr
smith again again
smiths shocked face falls away
gene heads for the door
dont let him go
officer trust steps between gene and the door
gene shoots him down and is out the door
gene stumbles out in the hall gun in hand
he hurries down the hall looking back to see the mystery man and a wounded officer trust spill out of room
the hall officer pulls his weapon mystery man get him
gene fires at the hall officer who goes down
gene rushes down the hall
one of the guest room doors opens and a man staggers out
it is a bloody wounded mr
gene stops in shock
i killed you
you fucked up
smith grabs him by the collar and throws him over a railing
gene is falling falling
he passes the ascending elevator and gets a glimpse of ms
jones and lynn pressed against the glass her face a mask of terror
the floor rushes up to meet gene and
he hits the floor thrown there by mr
his escape has been a dream
a wrist watch fills the frame
it is genes
we are seeing his p
hes laying on the floor his watch hand in front of his face
you nearly killed him too you idiot
nearly doesnt count
lose the p
im on record
i never wanted this
i wanted simplicity a telescopic sight a powerful rifle but no
what was good enough for oswald wasnt good enough for you two
you had to get fancy
drag some shmuck in off the street stick a gun in his hand
its academic now
she had to be killed
what were you going to do brendan
lock her in a closet
youre in the fucking kitchen now
get used to the heat
hes been seen all over the hotel looking like some loony tunes
we even got him on video
dont worry about it
gene stirs on the floor
about gene is he awake
he yanks gene to his feet
why dont we just give him our home phone numbers while were at it
it doesnt matter what he hears
he pulls gene over to the bathroom door
throws it open
gene reacts to what he sees within
thats what it looks like
she was alive a minute ago
now shes dead
because you wouldnt do what i told you to do
youve only got a few minutes to pull it together
smith takes gene out of the suite into the hall
the door closes
brendan the mystery man and officer trust are alone brendan grant i dont know if we should go through with this
its too late for that
there is a dead woman on my bathroom floor
what about it
shes eleanors assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun by the same lunatic
some anonymous loser who went over the edge
breathing easier only thing better would be if he were a postal worker
he wont be doing any work once i get through with him
and in a few months youre in the governors mansion
the peopled make you king of california if they could
brendan grant laughs
officer trust exits from the room and engages the hall officer in conversation down the hall
gene and mr
smith turns the other way walk
in an undertone im not stupid
i know how this is supposed to work
do you now mr
i kill her and you kill me
keep your voice down
even if you dont her security men will
they reach the elevator
smith punches the button
gene turns on him
how am i supposed to get away
thats not my problem mr
watson he gets out the walkie talkie keys it
into the walkie talkie come back
how do i know you wont kill my daughter once im gone
into the walkie talkie come back
smith is getting nothing but static
he angrily keys off hisses at gene i told you shed be alright if you do your job
and im supposed to trust you
what choice do you have
the elevator doors open
smith gestures graciously
they step into the elevator
stare at each other
the doors close
he grabs gene slams him into the outside window
genes face is smashed into the glass by mr
his body presses gene against the glass wall and he speaks his mouth an inch from genes ear
look out there
you see the van
the van can be seen below on flower street
you see it
he slams genes head against the window
he lifts up the walkie talkie
he jabs the walkie talkie next to genes ear
and then a scream
the horrible sound of a little girl in terrible pain
it cuts through gene like a stab in the heart
he struggles to turn around
smith kidney punches him hard
gene goes down on one knee
the car stops
someone starts to board it stops in surprise
smith sticks a badge in their face
take the next car
they back off
the doors close the car continues its descent
smith lifts the walkie talkie
a gasp no please
another bone chilling scream from the walkie talkie
gene is ripped to his soul
smith hauls him to his feet shoves him against the glass
you got one last chance
half an hour and that kid is dead
ill kill her myself
ill rip her fucking head off right in front of you
smith releases gene who goes limp
the elevator doors open onto the lobby
smith gets out straightening his tie wiping the sweat from his face
gene gets out of the elevator almost getting caught in the closing doors
he cant even fight back at the doors
they pound him a couple of times before he is able to step clear of the elevator
gene stifles a retch hurries away
smith is standing there
childish giggles erupt from the walkie talkie
filtered giggling daddy did you hear me scream
jones holds the walkie talkie for lynn
she told me to scream as loud as i could
did you hear me
gene staggers over to the row of sinks
leaning on one sink with both hands his body shudders violently
and he throws up
a man exits a toilet stall and walks toward the sinks
he sees gene retching turns away in disgust and leaves quickly
gene turns on the faucets
to wash the mess away
he tries to clean up but catches his reflection in the mirror
he has trouble looking himself in the eye
smith is fuming
into the walkie talkie the next time i tell you to do something you goddamn well do it
jones tries to be private on the walkie talkie
hey fuck you
you want to baby sit a screaming kid in traffic come out here and do it yourself
he got the message didnt he
lynn watches her knowing somethings not quite right
gene comes out of the mens room stands there at a loss
having a rough day
down at the heels as they say
what you need is a shoe shine shoe shine shoe shine today
gene looks around
huey has his nose in his magazine calling out his patter for whoever drifts by
gene walks over climbs into a chair
still not looking up take ten take a break take a seat take a load off
put the world in perspective
gene has settled into the chair
huey tosses the magazine aside swings into action
so are you a visitor or are you lucky enough to
and freezes staring at the familiar pair of shoes
as he looks up you got a complaint
gene looks down at him

huey kneels down gets his cashbox starts to open it up
from behind him come on lets get some privacy
it spills out of gene almost without volition
theres a note of pleading hidden in it
gene slowly points a thumb at hueys disabled veteran sign
he cant hear a word were saying
smith looks at the sign
huey stops what hes doing what the fuck
he almost says it aloud then you wouldnt be kidding me now would you mr

gene lowers his head covers his mouth with a hand
huey pretends to work on his shoes

they say theyll kill her if i dont do something for them
in twenty five minutes in the california ballroom
there was a woman
she was trying to help me
i watched him murder her

huey checks his perimeters then i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty
what am i supposed to do about this situation
one of them is in on it
he might even be in charge
her security is in on it
theres only one person i know for sure isnt in on it

gene gets down
if nothing else someone heard my story
he gives huey a twenty
keep the change

gene just stands there
huey has to give him a little push
gene turns and walks across the lobby toward the bar
his mind is racing
as he passes mr
i need a drink
smith rises immediately looks back at huey
huey gives him a symbolic tip of the hat
smith follows gene
gene finds a stool at the empty part of the bar
the place is half full noisy
the television is showing a game show
the bartender comes over
over television and time is running out
give me a
smith sits at the other end of the bar
the bartender gets him a beer
gene and mr
smith lock eyes in the mirror
between them a couple of t
news technicians are grabbing a quick beer
a video camera resides on the bar by them
gene notices officer trust walking by on a level above watching him
man i thought she was going to get out the violins
if i hear that stop the violence routine one more time im going to shoot somebody
a waitress appears suddenly at genes elbow surprising him
she puts a basket of pretzels next to him and a coaster next to his drink
heres your ginger ale sir
news technician politicians
theyre all the same
the waitress is tapping a long fingernail against the bar
gene looks down and sees it
a note on the coaster
mens room huey
the waitress turns the coaster over and leaves
gene looks down the bar at mr
smith drinking unaware
you know what bothers me
gene looks at his watch
when they get all weepy eyed about the ordinary citizen the regular joe the normal american
gimme a break
there aint no such animal
were a nation of two hundred forty million special interest groups
well im just a regular guy
news technicians stare at him
is that right
yeah thats right
but ive built a good solid business out of nothing
dont underestimate the regular guy
he heads for the open lobby
sir you havent paid
its on the special interest at the end of the bar
gene jerks a thumb at mr
smith and is gone
smith starts to follow him
the bartender is right with him
hey sir dont make me call a cop
smith slaps some money on the bar and leaves
left field bleachers heard from
smith scans the lobby trying to spot gene
officer trust comes up behind him
where is he
did you lose him
elsewhere gene circles around the lobby
there seem to be clocks everywhere
set of four clocks over the registration desk with the time for tokyo los angeles new york and paris
the souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display with the logos of various la sports teams
the restaurant the travel agency the newsstand all have clocks
everywhere he turns
gene has to look at his watch
genes watch and all the clocks tick over at once
gene winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick over one number in a thunderous chorus
hes near the mens room
hueys stand has a sign on the chair gone to lunch and there is a clock face with moveable hands
well be back at
sotto voice lets all hope so
and he enters the mens room
across the lobby mr
smith spots him heads that way
gene enters to find huey and gustino the bellboy
huey runs to the door keeping a lookout
quick off with the shoes and pants
trade with gustino
the big guys coming
smith marching towards the mens room
huey turns to see gene and gustino just looking at each other uncomfortable to say the least
no time to be shy
gene kicks off his shoes shucks his pants
he trades his pants and jacket with gustino who has done the same
gustinos pants are too big for gene
his pants are too small for gustino
gustino goes into a stall and closes the door
huey comes back from the door
gustino has taken a seat inside the stall but with genes pants still up
he drops them
and cover up them socks
man who dresses you
huey leads gene to another door
service personnel only
he taps on it
it is opened by a latino janitor
huey and gene slip through the door shut it
the janitor begins mopping the floor as mr
smith comes in
his eyes come to rest on the stall
all he sees are genes shoes and genes pants crumpled around the ankles
smith smirks and leaves
the janitor raps on gustinos stall with the mop
huey and gene move down a drab service corridor
boxes stacked on both sides floor buffers at rest shelves with cleaning supplies
gene notices for the first time that huey has a pronounced limp
they come upon irene the cleaning woman
she joins them moving down the corridor
irene is going to help
irene takes genes hand and leads him along at a half trot
where am i going
they come through a short corridor and onto the service elevator
you said there was only one person you knew wasnt in on this thing
youre going to go see her
the elevator doors close
irene punches the button for the twenty fifth floor
you sure shes asleep
i took up extra pillows
she take a nap before her big speech
what am i supposed to say to her
itll come to you
see if you can stop this thing fore it gets started
save us all considerable embarrassment
huey takes a pillow and a blanket from irenes cart and puts it into genes arms irene you dont have to save me
i got nothin to do with it
you aint gettin no key from me
the service elevator stops
irene pushes her cart out into the hall signalling them to stay put for a second
she starts moving out into the hall the card key falls on the floor
at the other end of the hall the hall officer turns when he hears her approach
gene and huey hover in the door of the service elevator
gene reaches down and snags the card key at his feet
the hall officer has to move his table aside so irene can pass with the cart
as he turns huey pushes gene across the hall to the door of the governors bedroom
the service elevator door closes
hall officer turns quickly at the noise
gene holds totally still in the alcove outside her room
hall officer looks suspiciously and finally sits back down
gene uses the key to let himself into lit only by a bedside lamp
eleanor grant is laying on the bed dressed towel across her eyes bare feet elevated on a pair of pillows
gene edges over slowly to her
he stands over her not knowing how to begin
softly excuse me
eleanor grant lifts a hand moves the towel from her eyes
who the hell are you
she sits upright reaches for the phone
gene moves putting his hand on top of hers on top of the phone
they stare at each other for a beat
she bolts for the door
gene beats her to it
she backs up to the bed
eleanor grant is a strong tough woman but shes not fearless
i wont hurt you
my security people are right next door
i appreciate that
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly
you wont get very far
think it over
if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already
a comfort to hear
i have a problem
only you can help me
im also sorry to say my problem is your problem mrs
she studies him
i remember you
in the elevator
you were very nervous
it was because i had this
in my pocket he slowly pulls out the gun
she takes it in
i need you to listen to me
three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what i have to say
friendly as can be of course
but suppose we set up an appointment
i have an important speech to deliver and youre cutting into my nap time
very slowly she moves to the table lifts the phone eleanor grant my assistant krista brooks takes care of constituent
krista brooks is dead
she freezes slowly replaces the phone
how do you know that
i saw her die
she was shot
with this gun
she turns to him
you shot her
i dont know
the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband
and your husband works for somebody else
what the hell are you saying
gene glances at the bedside clock
he looks back to the governor
an increasingly edgy mr
smith is looking at the mens room door
he glances over to officer trust whos keeping an eye on him
he looks at his watch again then gets up and heads for the mens room
hector is at the urinal
smith checks out the feet under the stall
he has to bend over to check properly
genes shoes gene s pants legs
hector notices mr
smith is aware that hes been noticed but he is very suspicious
hector flushes the urinal
smith stays by the stall
he is going to look over the top of the stall
he rises on his tiptoes
but hector is staring at him like hes a pervert
smith is suddenly embarrassed
he backs away from the stall
hector washes his hands watching mr
smith in the mirror
hector dries his hands
he walks over to the stall and knocks on the door
and gustino tosses a bellboy jacket over the top of the stall
hector puts it on
hey gustino what takes you so long
you need to eat more fiber
you got anything to read
the clock on the nightstand
eleanor grant sits against the headboard
gene sits on the edge of the bed the gun all but forgotten held loosely in his hand
i knew you wouldnt believe me
i said id listen to you not necessarily believe you
youre telling me my people are in a plot against me
youre telling me my husband wants me killed
what do you expect
i dont blame you
i dont have any proof
but nothing like this occurs in a vacuum
you cant be totally oblivious
you must suspect something
youre doing things which are making people angry
people who have been in power a long time are losing their jobs
you know them better than me
how much does it mean to them
how far would they go to hang onto it
her eyes go inward reflecting a vague doubt
gene sees it hurries to follow up on this possible chink in her armor
excited by it he gets up forgets to cover her so closely
theres only one way to find out for sure
try to cancel the last speech
smiling covering her inner thought id prefer we didnt refer to it as my last speech
its the last chance they have for me to kill you
try to get out of it
they wont let you
try to change the schedule and youll know im right
what have you got to lose
it comes down to who you trust them or me
i love it when pistoleros talk of trust
gene across the room looks at the gun in his hand
he takes the plunge
ive never even fired one
eleanor grants hand sweeps the lamp off the table plunging the room into blackness
in the blackness franco
gene slips out into the hall as the connecting room door flies open
light from the other room spills in
franco rushes in pulling a gun
the hall officer jumps from his chair and runs into the suite gene quickly moves to the service elevator and pushes the button
eleanor grant stares up at franco back lit by the light coming from the next room
it gleams off the gun he holds in his hand
she stares from the gun up to his hulking frame
what is it governor
im afraid ive had a bad dream franco
the service elevator opens and gene rushes out
he hurries down the dim service corridor
suddenly an arm snakes out of the blackness and grabs him
huey steps into the light
i dont know
what are you going to do now
i dont know
i have to get back
gene keeps moving fast
huey limps to keep up what are you going to do
this is about power and you havent got any
theres nothing more you can do
thanks for trying
huey watches him disappear
smith sees the t
technician and reporter leaving the bar with their equipment
alarmed where is he
smith looks at the man who has appeared behind him
in the john
he looks at his watch
you oughta learn to relax
i told you ive got it under control
its time now
smith scowls and heads for the mens room
a different watch
the minute hand moves to
it is ms
she is in the drivers seat
she looks back at lynn who is trying to amuse herself one way or another
she checks her gun
she pulls out her walkie talkie puts it on the seat beside her
she starts the car
where are we going
not very far honey pie
not far at all
she pulls the van out into traffic
smith bursts into the mens room
he goes to the stall and lifts his fist to pound on the door
out of there mr
your times up
the stall door opens and gene comes out zipping up his pants
he brushes right past mr
smith heads for the door
smith reaches out grabs him
you forgot to wash your hands
he throws him against the sinks
gene washes his hands
smith leans against the sink next to him in the mirror above the sink gene sees the stall door swings open
gustino is huddled in the corner feet up on the toilet
smith doesnt notice
ive got faith in you mr
i know youre not just a regular guy see i know that
even if you dont know it yourself
maybe thats why i picked you
gene steps between mr
smith and the open stall door
i know what i have to do
ill do it
andthey exit the mens room
gustino slumps with relief
other lights have been turned on
eleanor grant is fixing her hair in the mirror
franco is cleaning up the broken lamp
there is a perfunctory knock on the hall door and it opens revealing brendan grant
the mystery man hovers in the background
hey el hows the head
she turns locks eyes with the mystery man
she nods turns back to the mirror
and i have siesta hair
im thinking of canceling the speech
its an important speech
id say critical not that its any of my business
its just another speech in a tower of babel so high that nimrod himself would be put to shame
make my apologies
in the mirror she takes note of brendan grant and the mystery man exchange a look
ill trot along
nice to see you eleanor
brendan steps into the room shuts the door
during a campaign every speech is important
this is free media exposure
primetime news coverage that we couldnt buy
whats he doing here
hings have changed brendan
i thought you understood that
hes my friend
and he did help you to get elected after all
dont remind me
re the broken lamp what happened here
i broke a lamp
brendan steps behind eleanor and puts his arms around her affectionately
ill put it this way
this speech or a half dozen rubber chicken fund raisers
what do you say
truth is besides the headache ive come down with a little lower intestinal havoc
make my apologies
come on el youre a trooper
ill get you some pepto youll make one of your patented tributes to the common person then back to sacramento
this is no time to lay down on the job
i dont care what the polls say you cant afford to relax
look what happened to bush
tell you what if you want to blow off the sacramento speech fine
but do this one and well get out of the smog
eleanor grant looks at him almost sadly
she steps toward the dressing table to fix her hair all right ill do it
thats my girl
but i want to make some changes
get krista in here right away wont you
brendan looks at her for a beat then snaps his fingers like he just remembered something
i sent her on an errand
you sent my assistant on an errand
trying to look sheepish ive been a bad boy
it was not what she wanted to hear
smith pushes gene toward the escalators
all sorts of media people hover around campaign workers wearing political buttons and regular folks round out the crowd
people are eating drinking and talking
there are a couple of bars one at each end of the room
dessert tables are strategically placed around the room
on the speakers platform at one end is a podium with some chairs arranged behind it
one of the politicos takes the podium microphone
ladies gentlemen it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our governor
lets give a big l
welcome to mr
the crowd applauds warmly
gene and mr
smith move down the hall following the signs to the california ballroom
the entrance to it looms ahead
brendan grant at the podium
ladies and gentlemen of the press campaign volunteers and those of you who were looking for any excuse to take off work for the afternoon
gene is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our friend the security man with the metal detector
he gives mr
smith a nod over genes shoulder and sends gene to join the crowd beyond
the video camera clumsily tracks past the crowd and comes tosettle on gene who is walking into the room not quite sure where he is going
we have with us today the first woman governor of our great state
gene is pushing forward into the crowd
he looks back seems surprised begins turning searching for someone as governor eleanor samara grant
what can i say about her
that wont get me in trouble when i get home tonight
lose the video camera effect
gene in the midst of the crowd cant locate mr
confusion clouds his face
he finds himself near the t
technician from the bar
the technician is talking into a walkie talkie
charlie are you reading me
he gets nothing but static
genes eyes move to the back of the room
shes a woman who loves our great state
gives it up i cant get shit on this stupid radio
gene looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back
a brilliant legislator
gene sees the glint of something
his eyes widen
is that mr smith there
he looks from the spotlight booth to the stage
who will soon win her second term as the greatest governor california has ever seen
somebodys going to ave to run down to the truck
tell them this radios fucked
gene looks away from the stage and locks eyes with officer trust
hes at the front of the ballroom to one side of the speakers platform
officer trust stares at gene like a hungry wolf clutching his gun in his pocket
they both hear i cant get through
walkie talkies dont work from here
theres too much concrete and stuff
realization floods genes eyes
he looks back at mr
smith in he booth
the camera pans along the barrel of the weapon until it comes to mr
smith who is settling into firing position
ladies and gentlemen
nothins getting out
officer trust presses forward hand in pocket
gene is his target
i am honored to present to you our esteemed governor and my beloved wife eleanor samara grant
the crowd erupts in
applause and cheering as eleanor grant comes from the rear of the auditorium and begins to work her way down the center aisle
she waves and nods to all the lyal supporters who surround her
thank you all
ballons are released above her onto the center of the floor
he is pushing a large high cart filled with hundreds of finished plates back towards the kitchen area
gene looks at mr
smith and officer trust and the impending disaster
he has to do something
gene begins frantically clawing his way toward the podium
but it is lost in the uproar
fighting to be heard above the noise gene clawing forward screaming hopelessly
he pulls the gun out
she spots gene in the crowd pushing toward her gun drawn
her eyes widen in fear
brendan grant follows her gaze
his eyes widen in something other than fear
gene aims his gun at the ceiling and fires
the gun in the booth swings from gene to eleanor grant
smith fires but his target is blocked by a panicked guest who is hit
from behind her franco runs to protect eleanor grant as more gunfire erupts
smiths aim is clear and he pulls
franco is hit in the center of the back and in the shoulder
he falls onto eleanor grant and they both fall down hard on the steps
blood is everywhere
he looks over and sees eleanor grant beneath franco looking very dead
he careens toward a door
on the dais brendan grant crawls over to where franco lays half on top of eleanor grant
they are both still eyes closed
brendan looks down at his wifes face splattered with blood
my god he did it
the governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath
her eyes snap open and burn into brendan
she has heard her worst suspicions confirmed
brendans a great liar but even he cant hide the shock and fear on his face
gene bursts through a door
he is followed speedily by officer you little son of a bitch
his attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness
the huge dish plate cart fully loaded comes flying toward them pushed by gustino
the cart smashes into officer trust throwing him against a wall dishes clatter and smash
gene raises a hand to the darkness and takes off
franco takes a shuddering breath
eleanor grant pulls herself free leans over him
she rips opens his shirt revealing a slightly used bullet proof vest with a bullet hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm
his eyes flutter open
are you all right franco
painfully id be better if theyd put sleeves on these damn vests
she touches his face looks over to where her husband stands
their eyes lock
its curtains for brendan
the van pulls into a waiting area
huey turns and spots a van arriving outside the hotel
he realizes who it could be
gene bangs out of a door comes to a failing and sees mr
smith has reached the spiral stairway
he starts down it two and three steps at a time
gene moves along the railing
smith is a whole floor below him
he looks up sees gene and lifts the walkie talkie to his mouth
gene pockets the gun climbs the parapet
gene lands right on top of mr
the walkie talkie flies over the railing and into the water of the central fountain
on the walkie talkie its time
you read me
i dont hear from you im going ahead now
smith and gene roll down the steps fighting
smith basically beats the crap out of him and gets up to continue on
gene somehow pulls himself up and tackles mr
he gets in a few lucky shots before mr
smith overpowers him beats him again finally
sending him flying into the fountain pool
ms jones looks to the back seat at lynn
why do you keep looking at me
thats my job
im your babysitter
as they talk ms
jones screws a silencer on her gun
im not a baby
youre a big girl huh
im not a big girl but im not a baby
ms jones turns to face lynn
close your eyes
ive got something for you
you ask too many questions
you want the surprise or not
lynn closes her eyes
jones makes to do the deed
suddenly huey appears behind her at the windshield
good afternoon madam
hello there little girl
with a crumpled up newspaper he begins vigorously rubbing the window
lynns eyes pop open
hey hey what are you doing
just giving you the gift of a clean windshield
only cost you a dollar
i dont want my windshield cleaned
you just think you dont want your windshield cleaned
no i know i dont want it cleaned

for the last time i dont want it cleaned
now get the hell out of here
its already done
ive already done it
you have to pay me now
i dont have to pay you nothin
youre going to deny me a lousy dollar after ive sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild
i dont think so
he reaches in the passengers window
i think this is worth a dollar
he snatches the walkie talkie off the seat
she lunges across
huey dangles the walkie talkie before her
oh well have to do better than that
you worthless piece of shit
she throws open the passenger door climbs out
huey backs away taunting her with the walkie talkie
she is caught between the van and huey trying to keep her gun under wraps
goddamnit you fuckin bum come here
gimme a dollar
she loses it hauls out her cannon
hueys leg is shot out from under him
he ends up on his back
jones swoops down on him trying to grab the walkie talkie
gimme that thing
hueys wounded leg is twisted under him
lynn is terrified by the gunfire and looks for someplace to go
jones jumps on the wounded huey who is stunned but bravely clutches the walkie talkie under him
goddammit give it to me you sunnavabitch
she sticks the gun in hueys face
he tries to take it away from her but shes really tough
the gun fires wildly hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing a chain reaction of collisions on the street
lynn tries to open the van door to escape
the vans door flies open
smith stands there gun in hand
daddy blew it
he points the gun
lynn jumps back in terror and clambers back in the van
she goes over the seat as he fires
the back window shatters
mr smith steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat
this time he wont miss
lynn has nowhere to hide
but it isnt his gun firing
he stands staring surprised wide eyed
and stares at gene soaking wet holding the gun
smiths gun slides from his hand
i told them
i could make a killer out of you
he drops to his knees pauses then tree falls onto his face
he rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to pick lynn up
she has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from huey to gene
she raises her gun and aims at gene and lynn inside the van
huey reaches down grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered artificial leg out of the pants leg and applies it to the side of her head
she is knocked aside and out
theres nothing like a good wing tip
at hueys shoe shine stand gene and huey sit in the shoe shining chairs
they are variously bandaged
lynn is on genes lap
she clings to him
her face buried against him
they are guarded by cops
what time is it
gene looks at his wrist gives an ironic smile
lost my watch
a hub bub catches their attention
a handcuffed brendan grant is lead out by state police
press flock around them shouting questions
eleanor grant watches her husband taken out
the press descends on her like ducks on bread crumbs
questions litter the air like confetti
any comment at this time would be most premature
please well have something for you in a couple of hours
eleanor grant finally makes her way toward gene
cops keep the press back
eleanor grant looks at gene for a long moment
would like to
thank you mister wat
i would also like to apologize
for not believing you
believe me i dont blame you
to lynn this is the governor lynn
lynn lets go of her father with one of her hands gives a shy little wave
the governor reaches out strokes the little girls hair
you have a very brave father lynn
lynn looks up
hes a hero
yes yes he is
dads are like that
she goes back to clinging to her father
gene looks like he might cry he loves her so much
can we go now
ill get a car to drive you
we dont need any help
well be just fine
wont we lynn
eleanor grant offers her hand to gene
same to you
eleanor grant walks away
the press renews their assault
huey and gene look at each other
then thanks for the shine
thanks for the tip
to lynn come on kid
i gotta make a phone call
he gets up wearily carrying his daughter grabs his briefcase and heads away
lynn peeks back over his shoulder at huey shyly waves
huey points at her
kisses to you
lynn laughs comes to life
no kisses to you
no kisses to you
across the lobby genes watch lays on the ground
the crystal is smashed the hands stopped
a shoe steps on the watch crushing it further
it belongs to the mystery man
he stops checks his perimeters and walks slowly toward the exit
