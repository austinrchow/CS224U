written by joe penhall based on the road by cormac mccarthy the intense buzzing of summer insects and the song of songbirds
a birds eye view of a bucolic mid west farming landscape corn field blue skies sunshine a farmer ploughing a nearby field with a tractor grain silos and a hay
a man with a horse
a clapboard house with a strawberry field a womans hand picks strawberries a woman lying in grass lazing
next to book shelves and an upright piano with sheet music on the stand chopin
there is also a dining room table with leftovers from an abandoned meal strawberries and cream
month later a warm night the man is asleep with the same woman now pregnant no sheets on the bed
the man is restless and wakes
a distant rumbling indistinct the man swings his feet off of the bed and goes to the window anxious
the man is in his shorts sweating putting a plug in the bath and turning on the taps as far as they will go
the woman appears in the doorway in a nightdress and leans against the door frame watching blearily cradling her pregnant belly
why are you taking a bath
the woman takes off her nightdress and goes to the bath
youll sleep better
he looks at her surprised shes misunderstood
put your clothes back on
she sees hes looking out the window now theres an eery rose colored glow of distant fire through the glass and distant shouts and screams
what is it
a man of about forty and a boy of ten are asleep camped on a tarp under a rock ledge the blackened chasm of a burnt valley spread out below
it is the same man seen earlier but ten years older thinner malnourished with a thick beard
they are both emaciated and exhausted their faces and hands coated in grime and soot from the burned blackened landscape around them
ash falls on the tarp which is bright synthetic blue the only color in sight
the man is woken by something he instinctively reaches out to touch the boy his hand rests on his chest and rises and falls with each of the sleeping boys
there is a low rumble the ground starts to tremble and the boy wakes
what is it papa
they listen as it grows nearer and louder everything shaking tree roots groaning and splitting until it passes between them with a roar like a subway train right beneath them
the boy is now clinging to the man and crying his head buried against his chest in fear
its all right
its all right
what was it papa
it was an earthquake
in the burnt barren landscape through swirls of soft ash and smoggy air the man appears dressed in a filthy old parka with the hood up a knapsack on his
back pushing a rusted shopping cart with a bicycle mirror clamped to the handle and the blue tarp now covering its load
the little boy similarly dressed with a knapsack on his back shuffles through the ash at his side like depression era dust bowl homeless
there is a flicker of lightning over head then more but no thunder
the clocks stopped at one seventeen one morning
there was a long shear of bright light then a series of low concussions
broken asphalt the earthquake has caused a large fissure to open up alongside the road with a sheer drop
the man and the boy edge past burnt trees and scrub
within a year there were fires on the ridges and deranged chanting
the screams of the murdered
by day the dead impaled on spikes along the road
they trudge past a vast lake filled with dead trees
i think its october but i cant be sure
i havent kept a calender for years
they truck along with the trolley through the fog the ghostly shapes of dead trees on either side and the shapes of barren mountains in the background
each day is more gray than the one before
each night is darker beyond darkness
the world gets colder week by week as the planet slowly dies
no animals have survived
all the crops are long gone
a tree falls behind them with a whump and they jump
someday all the trees in the world will have fallen
the man forages for petrol checking the nozzle of the pumps rummaging through empty oil cans he upends a bin to get at the empty oil bottles
the boy picks up a phone on a wall and listens to the dead earpiece
the roads are peopled by refugees towing carts and road gangs carrying weapons looking for fuel and food
they head down a long straight road towards a dark forbidding looking tunnel a turnpike
there has been cannibalism
cannibalism is the great fear
they emerge before a view of a deserted city state
they forage in a deserted mall
there are skeletons and human bones here and there
mostly i worry about food
food and our shoes
cu the boy examines the head of a moose mounted on a wall in a sears hunting store
sometimes i tell the boy old stories of courage and justice difficult as they are to remember
all i know is the child is my warrant and if he is not the word of god then god never spoke
they are camped high up on the ridge of a mountainside
there is a camp fire with wet clothes hanging to dry on sticks beside it
the man is erecting the tarp over string tied between two sticks stuck in the ground
the boy is sitting lighting a lantern using the scavenged oil inside the makeshift tent his shadow stark against the illuminated tarp
now you can read me a story
he gets out a book and looks at the pictures in the lamplight
the man reads him a story
the man awakens bathed in firey light as if the sun has come out
there is pale gray snow all around him with a quivering orange glow
he gets up to investigate looks to the line of trees up the ridge where a forest fire is burning crackling in the distance
he stands staring at the fire the warmth and light moving him enlivening him and not frightening him at all
the boy has got up and appears at his side yawning
he looks at the sky at a single gray snowflake drifting down
its like it used to be when the sun came out
the boy catches the snowflake in his hand surprised
they travel along the road through drifting wood smoke smoke pouring off the ground like mist and thin black trees burning like candles on the snowy ridge
they reach a spot where fire has crossed the road melting the tarmac
their feet stick in the molten tarmac it sucks at their shoes and they stop
just ahead they see a set of foot prints in the tar and study them
who is it
i dont know
the man looks through a pair of binoculars and sees a stooped figure up ahead a dying man dragging one leg slightly limping along
he stops and stands uncertainly then continues
the boy sees him too
what should we do papa
were all right
lets just follow and watch
take a look
take a look
the dying man is getting slower and slower as they climb a slope following until he finally stops and simply sits in the road
the boy hangs onto the mans coat anxiously as they approach
pov boy the dying man is burnt his clothing scorched and skin black with soot
one eye is burnt shut and his hair is a nitty wig of ash
his shoes are bound with wire and coated with road tar
as they pass by the dying man looks down averting his eyes
the boy keeps looking unable to take his eyes off him
papa whats wrong with that man
hes been struck by lightning
cant we help him
we cant help him
they keep walking away and the boy tugs at the mans coat
cant we help him papa
theres nothing to be done for him
they are camped under the bridge ash and slurry drift by on the river a dull sulphur light from the fires glows against the sky
the boy sits in silence with his back to the man
theres nothing we could have done
hes going to die
we cant share what we have or well die too
so when are you going to talk to me again
im talking now
are you sure
they come to a barn beside the road
they look at each other
lets take a look
the man picks up the revolver and they go inside cautiously
three pairs of feet wearing different shoes a mans shoes a womans shoes and a childs sneakers hang above three carefully placed chairs
the boy looks at the ground
you dont need to see this
the boy takes a few steps exploring he eyes the empty hay loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies
there could be something here
there could be corn or something
no they ran out of food
maybe we could find some hayseeds in the hayloft
now the boy goes over to the swinging corpses oddly curious
its not what you think
they committed suicide
what does that mean
you know what that means
the man goes outside while the boy thinks about it a moment
they walk away from the eerily silent farm stopping at an abandoned tractor by a weathered paint stripped letter box
the boy goes over and the man takes out his revolver opens the magazine and shows him two bullets in the chamber
you see that
one for you and one for me
he places the boys thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol
he curls the boys index finger around the trigger
you put it in your mouth and point it up
just like i showed you
he puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the boy nods wide eyed
he takes the pistol out of his mouth and uncocks it
you got it
is it okay
the man puts the gun away and cuddles the boy close
they set off again
flashback the woman is sitting by the window staring out at the garden which is barren now the sky gray but tinged with the same fireglow seen earlier a film
of gray ash covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy and colorless now a lot of the furniture gone
a pile of broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are stacked up next to the fireplace
in the fireplace the scorched ashen remains of piano keys
the woman is now heavily pregnant
the man sets down chipped old plates and spoons spoons beans from a pot and sits to eat
as the woman starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look of horror spoon halfway to her mouth
she looks down and pov woman water and blood running down her legs
its okay ill help you
just like we said
no no no
ill heat water
we can do it
as he goes out she moans in despair
the man rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard
instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears a bottle of antiseptic worn but clean towels and a pair of worn out yellow rubber dish gloves all laid
out in readiness
the woman appears at the door blood running down a leg
we dont have to
well i think we probably do
what kind of life is this
its the only thing left
he takes the woman back into the other room
the woman lies on the dining room table screaming as she has her first contractions
the man is wearing the rubber gloves one gloved hand resting on the womans leg about to deliver his own baby
he wipes his brow and leaves a smear of blood as the screaming goes on
inside a badly damaged trailer home one wall half fallen off a pan of water boils on a small fire
the boy sits shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin scraping around for the last one or two
the man opens his knapsack by the fire and produces a packet of cocoa
he fixes a cup of cocoa for the boy
he hands the boy the cup of cocoa and as the boy examines it and drinks the man surreptitiously pours himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it
the boy realises the man has left him all the cocoa
you promised not to do that
you know what papa
i have to watch you all the time
i know im sorry
if you break little promises youll break big ones
thats what you said
the man relents pouring the hot water back into the pan and taking some of the boys cocoa into his own cup
the boy wipes his finger around the inside of the empty bean tin and licks his finger
watch your finger
you always say that
thats because you always do it
the man spreads bits of a worn out road map on the boards and studies them
what are you doing
we have to keep moving
we have to go south to the coast
itll be better at the coast
because were going to freeze here
he picks up the map pieces carefully
the man and the boy truck along the blacktop
at the crest of a hill they come to faded billboards advertising motels and stop
the boy notices a sign in the distance which has words painted over a faded advertisement odd nonsensical biblical ramblings about bones and the dead
the man follows the boys gaze and reads behold the do you remember your alphabet
can you read that
good lets go
the man takes out a large revolver cocks it in readiness and places it on the tarp as they move
the boy eyes the man nervously eyes the gun and they move off
they trudge along the turnpike towards the opening of a deep black tunnel and the boy suddenly comes to a stop increasingly upset unable to face the yawning mouth of
i cant i just cant
theres no other way
we could go over
we cant take the cart over
we dont know whats in there
theres nothing in there
its just the same as it is out here
the boy sticks close to the mans side
the man has the revolver in his belt now and his parka unzipped ready as they nervously walk towards the mouth of the tunnel
the man has his arm around the boy as they push the cart cautiously ahead acutely aware of all thats around them
they pass footprints in the dried sludge on the ground
ash and litter blowing about and a handful of mummified dead refugees appear along the sides of the tunnel sitting and lying on camp stretchers their bags and supplies long
they are shrivelled and drawn like latterday bogfolk shoeless a couple of men a woman a small child and a dog
the man stares at the group
the boy stares at the small child and then at the mummified dog transfixed
the man puts out his hand for the boy to take the boy takes his hand and the man moves him on
just remember that the things you put into your head are forever
but you forget some things dont you
you forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget
the man and the boy are asleep inside an abandoned car amongst a line of other abandoned vehicles littering the turnpike
now the boys hand rests on the mans chest as he sleeps
the man breathes stertorously wheezing a little and the boys small hand goes up and down on his chest
suddenly the man wakes and rolls onto his side listening the revolver lying beside him
he slips his hand onto the revolver and raises his head slowly
he looks around nothing but the sound of a distant diesel engine
he looks at the boy fast asleep
when he looks back at the tunnel he sees a nightmarish vision
pov man exiting the tunnel shuffling through the ash a group of hooded men some in gas masks and filthy biohazard suits slouching along coughing casting their heads from side
to side and swinging clubs and lengths of pipe a road gang
the man listens to the sound of a diesel truck behind the gang
the boy jolts awake as the man shoves his pistol in his belt grabs the boy by the hand
they slide out of the car and crouch on the ground the boy is frozen with fear
its all right
its all right but we have to run
dont look back
their backpacks are still left in the back of the car
the flat bed truck rumbles into view men from the gang standing on the flat bed looking around some holding rifles
the boy falls and the man pulls him to his feet with such force he lifts him clean off the ground and has to dangle him back down again
its all right
they rush down the embankment into the trees alongside the turnpike
they run through the woods
the truck is heard in the background the motor missing and sputtering coils of black diesel smoke coiling through the woods
the motor dies with a flapping rattle and theres silence
the man and the boy crouch in frozen silence the truck now on the overpass nearby dangerously exposed to the view of the gang
they listen to the gang talking and raising the hood of the truck the man puts his arm around the boy and draws his pistol as they see the truck
begin to roll the gang pushing it
but it coughs and stalls again
the man sees one of the gang members coming down the embankment unbuckling his belt
he is emaciated in dirty blue overalls and a gas company cap and has a long beard cut square at the bottom and a bad tattoo of a bird on
he doesnt stop just keeps coming closer and closer until hes just feet away almost on top of them
he unzips his pants and takes a piss
as he stands pissing his eyes roam around at any moment he could look to the side and see them crouching there
the man is wide eyed gun ready eyes darting from the gang member to the boy to the gun
the gang member rolls his shoulders and exercises his neck
he looks down and studies the steam coming off his piss
the man silently trains his pistol at the head of the gang member who as if by instinct rolls his head around and looks right at him
just keep it coming
the gang member sees the gun and stops pissing looks back at the truck zips his fly
dont look at them
look at me
if you call out youre dead
where you from
does it matter
where you from
whats the truck running on
where dyou get that
i dont know
you dont know huh
the gang member just stares not answering
you got ammunition for those rifles
the gang member looks back towards the truck
i told you not to look back there
where dyou get all that stuff
what are you eating
whatever we can find
whatever you can find huh
now the gang member looks at the boy causing the man to raise the revolver and cock it
pov gang member he looks down the barrel at the magazine and sees empty space
you wont shoot that thing
you aint got but two shells
maybe just one
and theyll hear the shot
on the over pass the road gang are looking around murmuring as they notice one of their number missing
but you wont
itll be through your skull and inside your brain before you can hear it
the man steps closer and aims the gun at the mans forehead hammer back ready
to hear it youll need a frontal lobe and things with names like colliculus and temporal gyrus and you wont have them anymore because theyll just be soup
are you a doctor
im not anything anymore
we got a hurt man
itd be worth your while
the man glances in the direction of the road gang then back at the gang member who is still eyeing the boy
the boy is sitting with his hands on top of his head peeking out through his arms terrified as the tension escalates
if you look at him again ill shoot you in the head
ill bet that boy is hungry
why dont you all just come onto the truck
get something to eat
aint no need to be such a hard ass
you dont have anything to eat
i aint going nowheres
you think i wont kill you but youre wrong
you know what i think
i think youre chickenshit
you never killed a man in your life
he drops his belt on the ground with a clatter a canteen and army pouch hanging from it
the man eyes the army pouch eyes the gang on the road and notices for the first time some of them are wearing the same army pouches
one is banging his stick on the side of the truck to call their lost member
the man is distracted by this and when he looks up the gang member has taken two silent steps and is standing between him and the boy holding a knife
what do you think youre going to do with that
without a word the gang member dives and grabs the boy rolls and lands on his feet holding the boy against his chest with his knife at his throat
simultaneously the man drops to his knees trains the pistol and fires from six feet away shooting the gang member in the forehead
he falls back and lies with blood bubbling from the wound eyes open the boy lying in his lap in shock deafened expressionless covered with gore and mute as a
the gang hear the loud shot and freeze they start looking around them more urgently now
the man grabs the dazed boy by the hand and yells but in his deafness the boy hears only a muted soup of words move
the man shoves the pistol in his belt hoists the boy onto his shoulders and sets off down the road at a run
they crash through the woods the man straining to keep the boy aloft and find a path through the trees the boy clutching the mans head with both hands
theres a sickening thud and the man falls the boy flying off with a cry
the man struggles to gather his wits unsure whether hes been felled by another man
get up get up quickly
the man swings the boy onto his shoulders and runs
the man and boy stagger through trees and the man drops to his knees letting the boy down
they are back by the turnpike again
they listen and watch utterly exhausted and out of breath the man is wheezing the boy at his side holding his hand staring in shock still
its okay now
youre going to be ok
pov boy the boy can still hear nothing temporarily deaf
but he sees the man talking and looking around through degrees trying to work out where its safe to go
he grabs the boys hand and they take off again
the man pulls out blankets from his knapsack
the boy sits staring shocked as the man tries to wipe the blood and gore from his face but its thick and congealed now
his hands tremble as he tries to pick it from the boys hair
its okay now
frightened by the boys muteness he wraps him in a blanket unzips his parka and holds him close under the parka
the man picks up his revolver checks the chamber only one bullet left
he eyes the flickering shadows in the distance and then eyes the boy making minute calculations of distance calibrating the space between the road gang and the boy
he holds the revolver up and cocks it
i try to look like any common traveling killer but my heart is hammering
when it comes to the boy i have only one question can you do it
when the time comes
there is no moon but not far away perhaps yards a firey torch makes its way through the woods
about yards away from that another torch is being used to search
shadows flicker ominously
the sounds of twigs snapping underfoot and branches being broken as the road gang searches wordlessly just breathing heavily through their masks and beards
the man clutches the boy tighter and stifles a cough
they remain frozen like this unable to budge
they are by a thin toxic rust red stream slushy ice at the edges and gray froth
the man leans down and pushes ice away and scoops up a hand full of gray water
he runs it through the boys hair to wash it and the boy flinches with cold
he rubs more icy water into the boys hair roughly quickly with a sense of panic as he helplessly tries to wash out lumps of flesh and blood
the boy is weeping silently and shivering from the extreme cold as the man picks out the dried gore and washes the hair clean
its no use crying
you have to talk to me
he takes the blanket and dries the boys hair as he talks
im not going to let anything happen to you
im going to take care of you
im always going to try and be here for you
and im going to kill anybody who touches you
he smooths the boys hair down with shaking fingers clumsily trying to brush it out of his eyes a fatherly instinct to make the boy neat
because thats my job
do you understand
when hes through the man lifts the boys thin arms puts a vest over his head then a ragged sweater then he folds the boy into his parka zips it
up to the neck and kisses him on the top of the head
the man grabs his knapsack tips it upside down rummages inside its empty
come on we need to get the cart back
approaching the embankment the man walks quickly and stealthily wired listening to the silence straining to hear sure hes being watched
the boy stumbles along behind slower fatigued makingthe man anxious
the man leaves the boy hiding wait here
he starts to climb the embankment and hears little running footsteps as the boy comes after him he turns to face the boy urgently exasperated
no i need you to wait
ill hear you if you call
ill just be a little ways and ill be able to hear you if you get scared and you call me and ill come right away
he walks off but hears
the little boys footsteps running after him again he turns around
i said wait
the boys face crinkles up and a tear rolls down
i need you to do what i say
take the gun
the boy freezes refusing to take the gun
just take it will you
the boy shakes his head
we dont have time for this
we need our food
the man shoves the gun into the boys hand
he creeps up the embankment
the boy just stares at the revolver
the man searches for the cart
he comes to where theyd left it in between the abandoned cars
their backpacks lie open on the ground next to the cart on its side its contents spilled out mostly plundered just a few childrens books and toys old pots and
pans shoes and ragged clothing remaining
nearby are the remains of a large campfire in the middle of the turnpike
the man collects up the few remaining possessions and puts them into the backpacks
pov man he sees charred billets of wood ash and
the bones of the shot road gang member
nearby is a pool of his blood and guts still gently steaming the head decapitated and rolled under a car
he nudges the bones with the toe of his shoe
below down the embankment the boy is waiting obediently with the gun
the man heads back to the boy trying to think what to say
the boy hands the gun back and takes the mans hand and they walk away into the woods the man tucking the gun back into his belt
lets get out of here
the freeways too dangerous
find the back roads
flashback now the house is in considerable disrepair no furniture the skirting boards falling away large cracks in the walls cornices and lamp fittings pulling away from the ceilings water
marks from rain the windows covered with corrugated iron sheets
the man and the woman are sitting across from each other with a lamp illuminating the dark
between them lies the revolver seen earlier
the woman picks up the gun and swings open the magazine
there are two bullets in it she takes them out and places them on the table one after the other
thats all thats left
i should have done it when there were more bullets in the gun
the man shuts his eyes unable to take it
in the corner the boy is standing in the background drawing on the walls
sooner or later no listen they will catch up with us and they will kill us
they will rape me and they will rape him please no just no they are going to rape us and kill us and eat us and you wont face it
youd rather wait for it to happen
ill do anything
such as what
she picks up the revolver and puts the two bullets into the chamber
i thought about not even telling you
just doing it
id empty every godamn bullet into my brain and leave you with nothing
dont say that
dont talk this way
theres nothing left to talk about
my heart was ripped out of me the night he was born
please dont do this
i wont let anything happen
i dont want to survive
id take him with me if it werent for you
you know i would
why cant you face it
will you listen
youre talking its not crazy and you know it
its the right thing to do
they glance at the boy
other families do it
she goes to the boy strokes his hair kisses him makes a reassuring display of being motherly
time for bed theres a good boy
she picks him up in her arms and carries him off to bed
the thunder of a waterfall the river disappears into space the boy and the man stand staring up at the waterfall feet above shrouded in gray mist
a color spectrum is visible rising from the waterfall like a rainbow the boy is transfixed clutching the mans arm for safety
what is it
the man looks at the boy surprised hes talking again
its a waterfall
there used to be color everywhere
you dont remember
it was before you were born
there used to be so many thnings
the boy approaches the waters edge shallow and clear with gravel and pebbles sparkling at the bottom
he scoops up some water surprised that it seems clean
do you want to go in
i dont know
sure you do
is it okay
just dont swallow any
the man unzips his parka and slips it to the ground
the boy eyes the man surprised then does the same
naked pale filthy dirty and shivering with cold the boy frolics in the spray of the waterfall
the man watches him enjoying himself by the waterfall clutching his shoulders hopping up and down he joins him
the man has strung the tarp against a rockface to make a shelter
he meticulously filters water through a rag into a pan
in the background the waterfall can be heard rumbling
the boy has painted his face with crayons drawing a bizarre set of fangs and dripping blood around his mouth
the man studies the boys painted face a moment
that man back there
theres not many good guys left thats all
we have to watch out for the bad guys
and we have to talk
we have to just
keep carrying the fire
the fire inside you
the boy is thoughtful a minute and then are we still the good guys
were still the good guys
and we always will be no matter what happens
he eyes the boy uncertainly unsure if he can promise this
always will be
the man goes back to tying the tarp
the man and the boy are trudging along away from the waterfall now
we have to keep moving
other people might be attracted to the waterfall just like we were
we wouldnt hear them coming
they stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the do you think there could be fish in the lake
theres nothing in the lake
they move on
they come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the roar of river rapids
up ahead they see a bridge with a jack knifed truck on it
they walk out onto the bridge over grey frothing water and inspect the truck
the tyres are flat the cab jammed against the railings
the trailer end has swung across the road knocked out the railings and lies with its last few feet hanging over the side of the bridge blocking the bridge off
the man climbs up onto the gas tanks wipes the glass and peers into the cab
he swings the door open and climbs inside pulling the door shut behind
he looks around at discarded detritus old magazines and trash
he checks behind the seats where there is a mattress on a bunk and calls out
come up here
snow continues to fall on the dusty windscreen
outside all around snow falls silently covering the truck and the bridge transforming it
they are both still awake unable to sleep staring at the transformed world carpeted by snow
so am i
can i ask you something
are we going to die
and were still going south
so well be warm
and there might be food there
everything depends on reaching the coast
the man draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight it is now pitch black
go to sleep
i wish i was with my mom
they are silent a moment until you mean you wish you were dead
you mustnt say that
its a bad thing to say
i cant help it
i know but you have to
you have to stop thinking about her
we both do
how do i do that
the man is silent lost in thought
the man gets down from the cab and walks a few feet in the dark and snow
he coughs a bit takes a few breaths of air and walks away from the truck vanishing into the mist
the man is alone now by the road
he takes out his wallet and sifts through money ancient cards drivers license and a picture of himself and the woman on their wedding day which he studies a moment
she was gone and the coldness of it was her final gift
she died somewhere in the dark
there is no other tale to tell
he lays everything out on the grey slushy ground then flings the wallet into the river and walks back to camp leaving the photo and cards to blow away
flashback the woman kisses the man
will you tell him goodbye
will you at least wait till morning
stay with me through the night
i have to go now
they kiss again she turns and walks away out of the yard
what am i going to tell him
what are we going to do without you
you should move south
you wont survive another winter here
the man follows a few steps and she stops and turns to him
why wont you help me
i cant help you
dont you understand
this is how im helping you
where are you going to go
you cant even see
i dont need to see
im begging you
the man stares
she goes vanishing into the darkness
the man stares
in the distance a dead city
the man and the boy approach the edge of the city
up ahead a cluster of three tall buildings a dozen or so floors of concrete and glass the upper floors of one illuminated by the flickering fire glow of candle
the man stops and stares and the boy follows his gaze
in one of the illuminated windows a silhouette figure stares back at them somebody in the building
in another window another silhouette figure is staring out motionless they could be refugees cannibals or more mummified dead for all we know
who are they papa
i dont know
what if its more bad guys
it wont be more bad guys
he takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different direction now giving the high rises a wide berth
well be okay
when they get to the end of the block they stop and the man checks around the corner before they cross the street
in the distance three men appear emaciated slow moving
they step forward stop and watch the boy and the man
the man now carrying the revolver and the boy head off down a railway track that leads away from the city
in the country along the railway they see past a small road to a once grand house on a rise
it is tall and stately with white doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that curves up from the road through a field of dead foot long grass
they stand there staring at it the boy still holding the mans hand
the man listens nothing but the wind in the dead bracken a creak of a door or shutter rattling
i think we should take a look
theres nothing to be scared of
the man sets off up the drive
he stops and faces the boy who is rooted to the spot
you want to stay here
the boy joins him and they set off slowly up the drive through patches of melting snow
there is a tall dead privet fence with a deserted birdsnest in it
they climb the steps to the porch the boy clutching the mans hand
they notice a window is slightly open
the man goes to it opens the window wide looks inside
they climb through the window onto black and white marble tiles and the man carefully shuts the window a little so its the same as when he found it
they regard the room binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair
an elaborate staircase in front of them william morris wall paper water stained and sagging plaster moldings and cornices sagging from the ceiling
they cross back to the other side where there is a great hall of a drawing room high ceilings huge fire place with raw brick around it where the wood
has been stripped a pile of warm weather clothing boots and backpacks on the floor by the hearth
they creep in and find blackened pots and pans a cord with a bell for servants trash piled on the floor and work tops a rusted sink covered in mould
in the floor is a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate
the man examines it while the boy tugs at his arm frightened
papa lets go
theres a reason this is locked
the boy is now panicky hopping about close to tears
dont open it dont
i need something to pry it open
the man goes out abruptly and the boy follows wringing his hands in fear
the man comes out the back door with his revolver drawn looks around and sees an old station wagon with flat tyres on the dead grass
beside it is a gallon cauldron on the blackened remnants of a fire
there is also a wooden smoke house with thin wisps of smoke coming off it
the man studies it nervously sniffing the air then goes to the tool shed and starts sorting through tools
he finds a long handled spade and hefts it in his hands
the spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch
the man hacks away then prizes up the hatch lock and all revealing a gap of darkness
listen to me
just stop it
do you understand
i have to do this
i dont have any choice
the man opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor
just wait here
im going with you
just stay close to me
nothings going to happen
they descend the rough wooden steps
there is a terrible stench and they have to cover their mouths and noses with their parkas
the man gets out his lighter lights it and tries to light the way
pov man blackness except the small area illuminated by the lighter as the man searches part of a stone wall then a clay floor an old mattress with dark stains
the glow of the flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the man steps closer then plays the lighter along from the corner to huddled against the wall
all trying to hide shielding their shining eyes from the light naked men and women thin as skeletons like inmates in a death camp
the boy jumps shocked and the man freezes staring dumb struck by on a mattress on the floor lies a naked man with his legs gone to the hip their
stumps blackened and burned cauterized
the boy covers his eyes
the man on the mattress turns to them and whispers a low indistinct murmur at first
please help us
the others join in an eerie chorus of whispering help us
please help us
the man turns and grabs the boy and rushes for the steps
the man drops the lighter as he tries to push the boy up the steps
out of nowhere a bearded face appears at the foot of the stairs blinking
theyre taking us to the smoke house
the bearded face reaches out and feebly tries to grab the mans arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the boy up the steps following in a blind
panic fumbling and missing his footing
they scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as the bearded face reaches out and tries one last time to grab at the mans feet but he
the man scrambles out slams the door shut and drags a solid table over the door
he looks around for the boy
the boy is near the window dancing up and down in terror pointing out the window to coming up the path toward the house are four bearded men and two
women all suspiciously well fed and healthy looking
one of the men holds hands with one of the women as if they were returning from a stroll before dinner
the man stares a moment frozen with horror then grabs the boy by the hand and jerks him away
they tear through to the front door the man fumbles to get it open but it has a well maintained deadlock on it
he stares out the window next to the door and sees pov man the well fed people are climbing the steps of the porch
the man grabs the boy and they rush through into kitchen
in the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and the table elevating inches
they rush back out again
as they reach the stairs a key turns in the lock and the man picks up the boy in his arms and they sprint to a door under the stairs
as they get through the door the front door swings open and the well fed people drift inside
they are in a small rest room under the stairs just a toilet and a basin
the boys face is level with the basin and while the man is holding the door shut the boy comes face to face with the contents of the basin pov
boy bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and tallow in the basin
around the basin are bloody red hand prints on the white porcelain
pov man through a thin crack he sees the well fed people on the far side of the foyer chatting casually
he is not close enough to hear everything they say but close enough to see that the mens beards are trimmed and they wear well repaired clothes
im going to freshen up
i need a drink
im going up to change
he hears one of the women stomping across the old floorboards and up the stairs to change while the other woman takes a few steps towards the rest room then
turns back towards the window as the conversation lurches on
who left this window open
i leave it open for the smell
you dont smell it anymore
who wants a drink
they hear the sound of the window being closed and latched
as all this goes on the man is frozen eyes wide with fear he slips the pistol from his belt cocks it and squats on his haunches so hes close
to the boy desperate unable to decide what to do unable to think straight with fear
the boy is staring from the door to the pistol to the bloodied basin as if hypnotised in shock babbling somewhat
there are foot steps outside the door as the well fed people drift closer and then away again
the man starts to cough but he has the revolver in one hand and the boys hand in his other
the man tries to stifle his cough but cant
then the boy notices and holds his own small hand to the mans mouth stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside will you help me with the dirty
as the coughing subsides a little the man takes the boys hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it
the boy tries to resist shaking his head terrified mute
the man puts his left arm around the boys tiny thin shoulders and holds him close
dont be afraid
if they get hold of you youre going to have to do it just like everybody else
do you understand
do you hear me
the woman turns from the window and one of the bearded men pours whiskey and hands her one
the boy is weeping and shaking his head as the man shows him again what to do with the gun
you have to be a brave boy
you know how to do it
i think so
say yes i do papa
he stares down at the little boy who just holds the gun feebly
he realises the boy wont use it
after a moment of torturous contemplation the man very gently takes the gun from the boys hand and the boy sits forlornly staring down at his hands afraid to look
at the man now
when the boy looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol the man aiming the large revolver at the boys forehead
what are you doing
the mans hand shakes his thumb trembles on the hammer as he cocks it
im so sorry
will i see you again
when will i see you
the mans finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly squeezes it
at that moment theres a loud thump from the kitchen and the well fed people stop and listen then rush through to the kitchen and immediately theres a commotion as
they see the state of the hatch with the table over it
what the fuck do you think youre doing
what the fuck do you think youre doing
dont look at me like that
what are you doing
the man gathers his wits and opens the door a crack
follow me take my hand dont let go
the man bursts out of the rest room with the boy and they make a dash for the open window
he sticks his gun in his belt and wrestles with the window an old colonial style frame which sticks
from behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled grunts and shouts until the man wrenches the window open stuffs the boy through and follows
the man picks the boy up and they rush down the steps
they rush down the driveway and the man drags the boy through a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road
they hesitate a moment on the road deciding
come on keep running
they rush across the road to the woods on the other side the boy ahead as the man checks behind them
the man looks back towards the house and two of the well fed people have come outside looking around suspiciously
he hits the ground and takes the boy with him they lie flat at the edge of the woods and the road
they are wildly out of breath chests heaving the man coughing
keep your head down
pov man the well fed people walk a few steps down the drive and a bearded man looks through binoculars at the road and the woods but not directly at
the man and the boy hiding
the well fed people start looking around the side of the house walking away
the man and the boy get up dash through the treeline and disappear into the woods
a dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees as they set off through the woods sleepy stumbling like drunks now
they hear a hideous shriek in the distance coming from the house
they stop hearing another shriek and a mans screaming
the man holds the boy close and tries to cover the boys ears as they stare and wait for it to pass
well be safe soon
theyre going to eat those people arent they papa
the man does not answer
they are back in the city trudging through the parking lot of a huge shopping mall just outside what used to be sears department store
a dull moon hidden in the ashen sky illuminates the ruined store front as the man looks up at the mall thinking
the boy is just staring into space still in shock
the man and the boy have set up camp in the mall outside the sears entrance
the man is building a big fire
the boy stares through the glass at the deserted department store
nearby strewn across the doorway are bunches and bundles of cash in notes and coins
the boy looks closer and finds expensive items of jewelry still in their boxes looted from the store and discarded
the boy sits he looks like hes given up and then papa
papa we wouldnt ever eat anybody would we
of course not
no matter how hungry we were
even if we were starving
were starving now
because because were the good guys
and were carrying the fire
the man takes the boy in his arms
in a moment the boy starts blinking sleepily and drifts off to sleep and the man strokes the sleeping boys hair and kisses him on the forehead
they walk through the parking lot until the come to a supermarket around the other side
a few old cars in a trash strewn parking lot
the man heads through the defunct automatic doors
theres nobody here
the man and the boy trudge the empty aisles only litter remaining the once brightly colored packaging strewn around its contents long since looted
in the empty gun section there is a deers head mounted on the wall
the boy stops and stares mesmerised while the man searches the empty shelves for ammo finding only empty boxes
the man glimpses a womans face staring dolefully from an aisle an emaciated dead beat scavenger watching them vanishing as quickly as she appeared
on their way out they come to a pair of vending machines tipped over the sodas looted coins scattered around in the ash
the man sits beside one and feels inside the gutted machine eventually producing a single unopened can of coca
what is it papa
its a treat for you
he helps the little boy off with his knapsack and sits him down and opens the can of coke ceremoniously
the boy looks startled and sniffs the fizzing can as if its the strangest thing hes ever seen in his life
the boy takes the can
the boy takes a sip and considers
its really good
you have some papa
i want you to drink it
but i want you to have some
the man reluctantly takes the can and has a tiny sip hands it back to the wary boy
its because ill never get to drink another one isnt it
the man doesnt know what to say
they head out of the mall now towards the road lifeless traffic lights at the intersection town houses and apartment blocks on the other side of the road
the boy stops to listen stares around suddenly energised bobbing on his toes
whats wrong with you
what was that
i didnt hear anything
i dont hear anything
they listen more until very faintly we hear a dog bark in the distance
the boy turns around degrees to listen alert with anticipation
its a dog
where did it come from
i dont know
the man walks across the road past the apartments and the boy follows bouncing up and down over excited now
were not going to kill it are we papa
no were not going to kill it
why did you say that
you still got one bullet left
were not going to hurt the dog i promise
were not going to kill it and were not going to eat it either
maybe itll eat us
i doubt it very much
can we look for it
its gone okay
they trudge through the suburbs on the edge of the city past what used to be the local ball park now barren dead a vast flat expanse of ash and
cracked scorched earth forlorn stands and bleachers blackened by ash and soot
what is it
i used to watch the ball games here with my father
they walk up a once tree lined suburban street barren now ash and dust layer what used to be front lawns post boxes picket fences porches crazy paving
the man stops outside a typical suburban clapboard house with a dead cracked yard where the lawn used to be and a bare flag pole
the boy eyes the man enquiringly
what is this place papa
its the house where i grew up
they go up to the house clapboards have been removed for firewood leaving studs and insulation exposed
the boy stops reluctant to go further and the man takes a few more steps then turns around to check on him
i dont want to
dont you want to see where i grew up
there might be somebody in there
theres nobody there now
the man takes the boys hand and they approach a basketball hoop by the garage
the man is momentarily overcome with emotion as he recalls the details but it doesnt mean much to the boy
after a moment the man goes up the steps frightened but horribly compelled at the same time
the boy follows nervously
weve got to find something to eat
im not hungry
the man takes his revolver from his belt and approaches the front door warily pushing it open
well be all right
he goes through the front door the boy stays where he is rigid with fear
the boy notices a stuffed toy dog in the window staring out at the garden and his curiosity takes over
the boy goes inside carefully
the pine panelling is stripped from the walls there is some broken furniture but much has been taken for firewood
they go over to the fireplace and the man examines it
he runs his fingers along the mantle where there is an old drawing pin still stuck in the wood nostalgia overcoming his fear
this is where we used to have christmas when i was a boy
wed hang our stockings right here
the man examines the yellow tiled surround
the boy watches the man as if hes gone mad
my mother scrubbed these every day
its still spotless
much of the woodwork and the floorboards have been stripped and taken for firewood there are gaping holes
by the fireplace is a small pile of bones and in the grid are more burnt bones and the skull from the family cat
the man takes it all in sadly but the boy is unmoved
i dont think we should do this
you want to wait outside
the boy nods vigorously
he takes the boys hand and leads him out
the come out onto the porch
sit here on the stoop and dont go away
the boy sits quietly and the man goes back inside
after a moment he starts going through his knapsack less afraid now
the floorboards creak horribly swollen from rain or ripped up as he creeps into the living room
the timber cladding is stripped from the walls the ceiling plaster is collapsed beams exposed
the man pads through to the kitchen
the kitchen is similarly dilapidated the cupboards stripped bare
on a shelf by the window are dusty jars of fruit preserved
he grabs a jar prizes open the lid and finds a an oily slick of black mucus floating in the top like rotted mushroom spores
he sniffs it suspiciously holds it up to the light
in the light small black fish hook shaped spores drift from the top of the jar to the bottom
he replaces the lid appalled
the boy is sitting on the steps of the porch drawing with crayons on a pad taken from his knapsack
across the road is another big old house much of the clapboard missing swathed in dead brambles the boy suddenly looks up and stares at it distracted
the man comes outside and regards the deadened yard old garden hoe and spade gardening equipment and several dead apple trees
he goes over and examines the ashen ground and digs about to unearth several small dark brown shrivelled spheres spaced several feet apart apples
he bends down and picks one up examines sniffs
he gathers up the strange apples and stuffs them in his pockets
the boy is still staring at the house across the road when he notices a ghostly face completely still in a window
the boy drops the pad and crayon and stands surprised not believing his eyes it is the face of a small boy roughly his age which disappears almost immediately receding
back into the gloom like a ghost
the man is in the looted pantry
he finds some shrivelled raisins that haves spilt and hidden in the back of the shelf
he puts them into a handkerchief folds it and pockets it
he stop stop
the man freezes then charges out
the man rushes out and stares about frantically for the boy hes gone
the boy has run across the road to another house
pov boy peeping around the side of the house is the other small boy the same age similarly grimy and thin wearing an outsize woollen coat
the other small boy disappears down the side and the boy runs after him
i wont hurt you
the boy runs to the bottom of the yard where there is various suburban garden detritus a dusty lawn mower a clothes line a shed bikes with no tyres
where are you
the man comes sprinting up the side of the house and seizes him by the arm
what are you doing
what the hell are you doing
theres a little boy papa i saw a little boy
theres no little boy
whats the matter with you
yes there is
i saw him
a boy just like me
the man takes the boy by the arm and drags him back through the yard up the side of the house the boy resisting crying and looking back all the
why cant i go and see him
out the front of the house the boy digs his heels in and the man has to drag him his feet slithering through the dirt
i need to see him
i need to
i just do
the boy has gone limp weeping bitterly resisting being moved
the man gives up and squats beside the sobbing boy
okay im sorry
he holds him wipes his tears from his cheeks
in the failing light they come across a late model chevy abandoned under an overpass
will there be other boys like me at the coast
i hope so
the man goes to the car wipes thick dust from the windscreen and peers in its empty
they try to get comfortable in the leather seats the man spreading the blankets over them and tucking the boy in
they are quiet a moment as they watch darkness start to fall
i got you something the man produces from his pocket one of the tiny hard brown apples and holds it up to the remaining light
what is it
its an apple
he hands it to the boy who examines it curiously
the man takes out a pocket knife takes the apple back cuts the apple in half to reveal a woody brown interior
they regard the mahogany apple uncertainly the man is the first to take a bite with some difficulty
the boy bites his half and makes a face
suck it a while and itll soften
they sit sucking and chewing the ancient apple
did you ever have any friends
the man eyes the boy curious at the sudden question
lots of them
do you remember them
i remember all of them
what happened to them
all of them
all of them
the man and the boy make their way out of the ruined city
he yearns for his own friends and imagines how things will be different at the coast and that there will be other children there
when i have nothing else i try to dream the dreams of a childs imaginings
the man and boy walk along a desolate road in what was once farmland grain silos loom ominously still standing
do you know where we are papa
i think were about two hundred miles from the coast
as the crow flies
as the crow flies
it means going in a straight line
pov man in the background something catches his eye and he a frieze of human heads dried with taut grins and shrunken eyes perched on wooden poles
some are tattooed with targets and runic slogans
some are skinless with signs and words inked onto them
one has suture marks etched on it like a blue print for assembly
there arent any crows are there
just in books
yeah just in books
the man stares at the heads as the boy continues his conversation distracted and not seeing the heads
do you think there might be crows somewhere
i dont know
but what do you think
i think its unlikely
they keep walking and talking the man grim faced but the boy intent on whats ahead
could they fly to mars or some place
no they couldnt fly to mars
because its too far
the man discretely hurries the boy on with a guiding hand towards the woods and off the road
what if they tried and and and they just got halfway or something and then they were too tired
would they fall back down
on the edge of the wood the man and the boy stop to examine footprints in the snow
the man listens and hears the low thudding of bull drums in the distance
he looks at the exhausted boy a moment
we cant go back on the road
i think someones coming
the boy stares at the tracks
the man stares in both directions examining the road in the distance
he moves a few paces and notices tied to a dead sapling a thin red neckerchief
he takes a few steps and through a gap in the trees sees a clearing snow and a mass of blood red footprints the icy snow stained blood red like
a killing floor
will they see our tracks
well cover them
the man moves the boy away and kicks snow over their tracks then lays fresh ones going in several different directions
the boy copies him leaving his own maze of tracks
they run off keeping parallel with the road but staying off it
pov man in the distance two figures appear on the road
here they come
the man now looks over his shoulder for a good look then grabs the boys hand and takes off
two men come prowling on the road they are militants from some sort of army wearing the same red neckerchiefs and carrying weapons searching predatory
wider we see that only feet away concealed amongst the trees the man and boy are crouched in blankets watching
the two militants stop and look around as if they sense the boy and the man who freeze frightened to breathe
the militants sniff the air menacingly
one of them walks over to a stone by the side of the road leans down and starts sharpening his lance made from a the straightened coil spring of a
the man and the boy watch wide eyed
eventually the militants walk off up the road
what are we going to do
there is a thick carpet of gray snow
the man lays out a tarp on the ground and blankets on top
out of the murky sky more gray snow is falling
the man is distracted by a sudden noise the loud crack of sheering wood this time very close
he looks around just as out of nowhere a tree branch sails down barely missing them landing with a heavy whump just feet away
he tries to get the boy to his feet but he is limp staring around blearily exhausted
they hear another loud whump
then the groan of timber and another whump as trees start to keel over around them
the man grabs the boy and runs as best he can through the snow and falling trees
they have abandoned their blankets tarp and backpacks
just keep moving run
they rush through the woods as more and more trees fall one after the other whump whump whump great loads of snow falling from limbs to the ground with a
boom setting the woods shuddering
the boy is getting bogged in the snow and the man stoops and scoops up the boy and they cram themselves under a fat fallen tree to shield themselves
they are huddled inside a huge sewer pipe sheltering
the boy is wrapped up inside the mans coat wet and shivering wide awake nerves shredded too anxious to lie down and sleep now
the man boils water in a car hubcab
he takes from his pocket the handkerchief filled with raisins offers them
thats all there is isnt it
theres nothing left anywhere
they sit eating raisins saying nothing until theyre finished
can i ask you something
are we going to die now
the man just looks at the boy then looks away
what do you think is going to happen
were just going to suddenly keel over and die
it takes a long time to die of starvation
the important thing is water to stop you dehydrating
weve got water
well be all right
snowed in farmland in the background a rowoffallen and crumpled high tension electrical towers
atownin the far distance ahead of the boy and the man
theboyis hunched over with a hunger cramp
they are both wetandshivering
the man eyes the boy anxiously
the man stands on the back patio of a house on the edge of town the boy at his side fields stretching out before them the land flattened and dead
ravaged fences running the perimeter
in the yard are a few dead trees a fence a metal tool shed an old barbecue on the patio made from a gallon drum
the man slides the patio door open and peers inside gingerly
the man is in the bedroom looking around for useful things it has been stripped the wooden frame gone from the window the bureau ransacked and chopped up only a
summer dress on a wire hanger on the back of the door remains
he glances at empty drawers on the floor and a cupboard before turning his attention to the bed
he blinks and sways a moment trying to focus on pov man underneath the filthy dusty blankets a thin dried head pokes out the blankets pulled up to the chin
on the pillow are long hunks of rotted hair
every day is a lie
but i am slowly dying
that is not a lie
i am trying to prepare him for the day when i am gone
he takes hold of the lower hem of the blanket and tows it off the bed revealing a desiccated corpse
he ignores it shaking the blanket out and folding it under his arm
he notices the boy at his side watching wide eyed
nothing you havent seen before
they go out
the man opens and shuts empty cupboards slamming the doors increasingly desperate close to tears of frustration now
eventually he feels dizzy and has to sit on the floor
he just sits there alone on the kitchen floor clenching and unclenching his fists his head in his hands when he hears papa
the man draws his pistol and goes out alert again
the boy is staring at himself in a dusty flyblown full length mirror
as the man comes in he sees the boys reflection and his own and jumps
the boy stares at his reflection he looks like an alien skinny with giant staring eyes on shaky legs
we look skinny
we are skinny
the man puts the blanket around the boys shoulders
he notices an old upright piano covered in ash and dust
the boy stares as he goes to it lifts the lid and plays a chord
the boys eyes light up and he is magnetized instantly coming over and waiting for the next note
the man plays another chord
what is it
its a piano
whats it for
for making music
your mother played very well
i dont remember
before you were born
we had one just like it
it was beautiful
what happened to it
chopped it up for firewood
he stares into space slumps suddenly overcome with emotion as he remembers flashback just the man and the pregnant woman alone in the house just before the boy was born
some of the furniture has been broken up for firewood there are broken pieces by the fire and a huge axe propped on the hearth
the woman stands at the piano and tries to play
she plays for a moment and the man cracks a rare smile the piano is out of tune and she stops
she plays a bit more but soon starts to bang the keys atonally in frustration
the man just lets her get on with it until shes spent
i used to worry what would happen if there was a fire
what would i save
what could i bear to lose
there used to be so many things so many beautiful things
things people made
things nature made
who knew we would lose it all
ill strip the floorboards
you cant live without a floor
you cant live without a piano
she starts to dismantle the piano opening the lid taking it off its hinges its heavy she hands him the heavy lid and he reluctantly dumps it on the floor
its my piano
i bought it for you
it needs tuning
whos going to tune it
can you tune it
they look at each other sadly
they take the front piece away and dump that
the woman picks up the axe and hands it to the man
he swings it at the frame
the man walks toward a tin shed and crosses the dead grass
he stops suddenly
he stamps about a bit listening
he continues on into the shed
beside the shed sits an industrial garden trolley
the man reappears spade in hand
he digs the spade into the dead grass and hears it chomp into wood
he digs more urgently increasingly exhausted until a door is revealed in the dirt
he is so engrossed he hasnt noticed the boy standing a few feet away watching with saucer eyes scared
dont open it papa
itll be okay
please papa please
no its not
what if theres people hiding down there
the man ignores him focussed as he chops the plywood around the lock gets the spade under a corner and levers the door open
the boy has his fists bunched up to his chest bobbing up and down with fear
the man starts to descend a hand made wooden stair case in the bunker
he takes another disposable lighter from his pocket gives the child a kiss on the forehead and then disappears into the bunker leaving the worried boy staring after him
the boy looks around at the deserted yard as the evening draws in now even more frightened
oh my god
oh my god
what is it papa
oh my god come down
the boy is in the hole and down the steps like lightning
the little boy clatters down the steps
the man is busy lighting up candles
what did you find
i found everything
stored in the bunker are crate upon crate of canned goods tomatoes peaches beans apricots canned ham corned beef hundreds of gallons of water in ferry cans and in boxes
paper towels toilet paper and trash bags stuffed with blankets
the man takes the boys hand and helps him down then goes back up the steps and draws the door shut and jams a pair of metal pliers through the
heavy inside hasp to stop the door being opened
he goes back down the steps to the boy and holds up a candle to illuminate the shelves
can you see
what is all this stuff
can you read the labels
the boy stares at the brightly colored packaging hes never seen anything like it before
the man hands the boy a tin
it says pears
oh yes it does
they inspect the shelves chilli corn stew soup spaghetti sauce the boys eyes are like saucers
is it real
oh yes its real all right
the man pulls a box of butane lighters from the shelf and tests one it doesnt work
he tests another which works it has a large flame he uses it to read the labels
why is it here
because someone thought it might be needed
but they died
what would you like for breakfast
pears it is
the man claws open a box and pulls out a tin of pears
he gets paper bowls from a stack plastic forks and spoons lays them out
he finds a camping lamp
he puts a butane cannister in and lights up the lamp
he finds a can opener and opens the pears while the boy watches silently wrapping a blanket around himself and sitting on the soft bunk bed
is it okay for us to take it
theyd want us to
the man dishes up two bowls of pears and they sit side by side on the bunk with spoons and pears
these will be the best pears you ever tasted
you just wait
they eat in silence
they lick the spoons and drink the syrup from the bowls
the man feels inside his mouth with his fingers the sugar irritating a sore tooth
the boy smiles amused and the man opens another tin
ham and powdered eggs frying in a pan on the camping stove
the kettle is boiling on another ring of the gas stove
the boy just stares at the bubbling food as the man cooks
nearby a breakfast table is set out on a stack of boxes acting as a breakfast bar biscuits a plate of butter condensed milk salt and pepper plates and utensils
the man brings the pan over and forks over chunks of ham onto the pates then spoonsfull of scrambled eggs from a second pan then baked beans from a small
the boy just stares as if drugged uncomprehending the food alien to him
dont let it get cold
what do i eat first
whatever you like
the boy eats a hunk of ham as the man pours coffee
is this coffee
careful its hot
he hands him coffee
we did good didnt we papa
yeah we did good
the man puts the boy to bed in a bunk and smooths his filthy hair tenderly smiling with relief until the boy shuts his eyes and nods off
he covers the boy with a blanket and kisses him
he just sits watching the boy sleep suddenly on the verge of tears
the man folds the boys tiny clothes noticing the bulging pockets of his pants
he empties them creating a small pile of collected artefacts a smooth stone a marble an old house key bottle tops a smooth hand made indian arrow head fashioned from
stone lastly a broken piece of a womans mother of pearl hair comb
by the boys bunk he unfolds the crayon drawing hes been working on and examines it deeply moved
pov man an eccentric childlike drawing of the woman skinny like a stick figure but inexplicably with a brightly smiling face and big laughing eyes labelled simply mom in spidery
stirring classical music fades up and into flashback close in on a pair of legs in stockings a summer dress a womans hands holding a mans hand in her lap
the man feels the tops of the stockings with his fingers
wider the man is with the woman in a concert theatre at a recital
the woman wears the mother of pearl hair comb
the seats are velvet gold scrollwork adorns the boxes an illustrious fortunate world
the boy wakes blearily and immediately notices his collection of artefacts turfed out by the bed
nearby the man is dressing as the boy starts gathering up his collection crossly especially protective of the arrow ahead or just embarrassed
they look at each other
dont touch my stuff
the hatch opens and the mans face appears as he looks around
he opens the hatch more and clambers out with a couple of jerry cans of water the yard is quiet
next the boys face pops up and peers around
he clambers out carrying a big pot with a camping stove in it
they empty the jerry cans into the huge pot light the stove and put the pot on the stove to heat the water
the boy is in the bath filthy and scrawny as the man bathes him rubbing him with soap scrubbing an oily film of scum from his dirty neck to reveal
clean pale skin underneath
what do you think
nice and warm
he washes the boys hair lathing water over him with the pot
he has a sudden thought flashback the man watches unseen from the doorway as the woman tenderly washes the boys hair he is perhaps a year younger than at the
start of the film she appears lost in the task enjoying it chatting away to the boy momentarily unburdened
she sticks a finger in the boys ears giving them a good soaping which he likes
you could grow potatoes in these ears
end flashback now the man is in the tub also scrawny and filthy lost in thought as he soaps up the boy helps
the man trims his beard off with scissors in a mirror
he lathers up with shaving cream and starts to shave with a plastic safety razor
when the man is done he turns to the boy wiping away the foam
how do i look
wont you be cold
now the man is cutting the boys hair with kitchen scissors and a plastic comb
the boy has a towel around his shoulders and long locks of hair decorate it
the man finishes takes the towel off wipes the boys neck and face with a flannel holds up a mirror for the boy to see
i look funny
they sit on the bunk bed with a checkerboard between them sipping thick hot chocolate made with condensed milk from plastic mugs and concentrating on the board their worn out
wet blue jeans drying on a drying rack in the back ground
they are both wearing new sweaters too big for them plundered from the stores
the man watches the boy fondly absorbed in checkers
heavy rain slashes down on the lawn already pools of water are flooding the lawn
a shiny new quart of whiskey is slipped from its paper liquor store bag and opened with a soft crack
the whiskey is poured into a glass with a satisfying glug
wider another feast is laid out ham and powdered mash potato and biscuits and gravy
the boy is eating while the man pours a whiskey
the boy stops eating to watch the man drink the whiskey
the mans eyes glaze as he sips the strong liquor dizzy already
can i try some
you wont like it
makes you feel funny
the boy stares curious wanting it
you think i come from another world dont you
filled with all these strange things youve never seen
well i do i guess
the man just stands in the middle of the lawn coughing his guts up in the dark rain again the phlemy wet cough
he bends over sweating listening knowing its the sound of fluid on the lungs
as he listens he hears something above the rain he keeps shifting position as if hearing different sounds from different directions
nevertheless he anxiously looks around then goes to the porch and drags an old mattress over across the dead grass to the hatch
he lays it half across the hatch crawls through the remaining gap and hauls the mattress the rest of the way over the hatch then pulls the hatch closed with
the old mattress lying on top
it just looks like an old mattress lying on a lawn in the rain
the man listens to the patter of rain and hears another sound
something or someone rustling around the mattress above
he hears the sound of the mattress being dragged off of the door
he hears scrabbling and scratching on the door and freezes staring at the lock waiting for the inevitable
he quietly picks up the revolver
he looks across and sees the boy is now wide awake too staring wide eyed
what is it
maybe its a dog
its not a dog
its a dog
the man listens anxiously as the pawing and scratching continues the wood over the bunker amplifying the noise
he cocks the revolver and positions himself under the hatch ready
if its a dog itll be with someone
i dont know
after a torturous moment the sounds die away
im not waiting to find out
lets get out of here
i dont want to go
i know but its not safe anymore
the man grabs his gun and cocks it rushes about turning out all the lamps and they sit anxiously in the darkness
later its now lighter outside the mattress lifts as the man opens the trap door and very carefully peeps out
he looks around all angles checking the coast is clear then shuts the hatch again
the man starts loading cans and packets into a carton
he gathers a couple of large jerry cans of water
the boy helps
what are we going to do with all this stuff
well just have to take what we can
i wish we could live here
and we could keep the dog and the dog could catch food for us
look there is no dog okay
im sorry but there just isnt
well what is it
i dont know what it is
just say its going to be all right papa
just say it please
the man doesnt know what to say losing patience
listen trouble comes when you least expect it
so maybe the thing to do is to just always expect it
do you always expect it
i do yes
you always think bad things are going to happen but we found this place
maybe well find another place like this at the coast
the man dumps the carton of food on the floor and packs another organising jerry cans of water
the industrial trolley is loaded up and tied with a grey tarp
what are you doing
well have to cover our tracks from now on
the man drags the old mattress back over the entrance to the bunker
he carefully covers the surrounding area with debris
the man pulls the new trolley across a bridge stagnant black water underneath the trolley is now laden with jerry cans of fresh water and cartons containing as many tins
of food and supplies as they could manage
the boy trails along behind
they are a strange sight clean clothed clean shaven short haired in their new jumpers and now both wearing new surgical masks which they raise off their faces to speak
the man keeps checking behind him
pov man he sees the glint of glass perhaps a pair of binoculars watching them
the boy watches anxiously as the man gets out his own binoculars and looks through them
pov man a mysterious winking glint of light which quickly disappears
pov through a different pair of binoculars a completely different pov we see the man looking through his binoculars at us
i think theyre following us
i dont know
you think its bad guys
what if its good guys
i dont think were likely to meet any good guys for a while
we have to be careful now
weve got food
as they round a bend in the road they see a hunched figure walking ahead of them
the man stops abruptly gets out the binoculars and watches pov man a distant hunched figure hobbling away from them
they come up behind an old man hunched over withered silent as he hobbles ahead
he wears layers of torn clothing and his feet are wrapped in rags and cardboard tied with green twine
they slowly approach and the man stops turns and watches them suspiciously as they draw level
i dont have anything for you
you can look if you want
i got nothing
were not robbers
the old man leans an ear forward deaf
i said were not robbers
what are you
were just like you
what are you following me for
were not following you
weve got food we could give him
hes not getting any food
the old man looks away avoiding their eyes
hes scared papa
the man eyes the road to the left and right then draws his revolver
if this is an ambush he goes first
he goes out to the trolley and rummages in it while the boy and the old man stare at each other
the man comes back with a tin of fruit cocktail and a tin opener and opens it and hands it to the boy
the boy places the tin of fruit on the road in front of the old man
the old man doesnt move
what about a spoon
hes not getting a spoon
the boy urges him on miming with his hands as if feeding a raccoon
the old man picks up the tin and his filthy long nails clatter on the tin as he tips it to his mouth the juice running down his chin his
head jerking as he swallows
i see it
and i know what youre going to ask me
and the answer is no
whats the question
we cant keep him
they watch him eating painfully slowly
the old man finishes and sits down in the road holding the tin staring at it as if it might refill
when did you last eat
the old man just stares
do you want to eat with us
i dont know
what do i have to do
tell us where the world went
you dont have to do anything
can you walk okay
they help the old man off the road and hand him his cane but he pushes it away
i can walk
they walk off the road towards the dead blackened woods
as they leave the road the old man studies the boy
the boy goes to take his hand
dont hold his hand
he cant see
the trio walk into the woods
how old are you
ninety my ass
is that what you tell people
so they dont hurt you
does it work
whats your name
whats wrong with ely
theres a camp fire now
the old man sits wrapped in a quilt eating with a spoon and licking his plate clean
in the far distance the faint glow of fires
the orange light bounces into the night sky eerily
how come youre still alive
what do you eat
i dont know
people give you things
no they dont
the old man eyes the boy closely half blind
are you a little boy
what does he look like
i dont know
i cant see real good
is that right
can you see me
but i can tell somebodys there
you need to sleep
he gathers up the boy and takes him a few feet away settles him down in blankets while the old man stares into the fire
i had a little boy once
what happened to him
i cant talk about that
leastways not with you i cant
when the man returns he has his gun which he surreptitiously places on the ground in full view of the old man
you can see that right
tell me now
youre not a shill for a pack of road agents
im not anything
ill go if you want me to
i can find the road
the man stares at the old man cynically but the old man just stares back blankly
i live like an animal
you dont want to know the things ive had to eat
when i saw that boy i thought id died and he was an angel
i never thought id see a child again
i never thought that would happen to me
he is an angel
to me hes a god
well i hope thats not true
to be on the road with the last surviving god would be a pretty frightening experience
why do you say that
where men cant live gods cant either
the road gangs would tear you limb from limb both of you
the low rumble in the earth is heard again an earthquake this time in the distance
they listen a moment
i knew this was coming
this or something like it
there were warnings
people thought it was a con i always believed in it
did you try to get ready for it
what would you do
even if you knew what to do you wouldnt know what to do
suppose you were the last man left alive
how would you know if you were the last man alive
i dont guess you would know it
youd just be it
maybe god would know
if there is a god up there he would have turned his back on us by now
whoever made humanity will find no humanity here
the man pours hot water into mugs to make coffee hands one to the old man
do you ever wish you would die
its foolish to ask for luxuries in times like these
the boy and the old man are standing by the trolley
the man is watching from further away
the old man is fitting another can of peaches the boy has given him into his knapsack
you should thank him you know
i wouldnt have given you anything
maybe i should and maybe i shouldnt
i wouldnt have given you anything
the old man looks around orientating himself and goes tapping his cane without a glance back at the boy or the man
the man gives the boy a reproachful look and the boy looks defiant for the first time a new distance between them
hes going to die and you dont care
i care enough
maybe when were out of food youll have more time to think about it
you always say watch out for bad guys but that old man wasnt a bad guy and you cant even tell anymore
the man and the boy are camped inside an old church dusty faded stained glass is the only colour startling after all the monochrome
the man and boy are wrapped up in blankets a small fire going
the boy is asleep but the man is awake coughing
he sits up still coughing
he gets up and walks outside trying to stifle the coughing
he wanders into an antechamber coughing uncontrollably falls to his knees in a shroud of morning mist flooding the church and coughs up a gob of something dark and nasty
spits it into the misty ground
pov man the mist before him clears to reveal a spattering of dark blood on the pale ash
he stares shocked knowing what it signifies
the boy opens his eyes he hasnt been asleep listening to the man cough worried
the man returns and eyes the worried
i had a bad dream
i dont want to tell you
what happened to me
the boys face crinkles up he starts to sob
the man coughs again and the boy shoots out a hand puts it over the mans mouth to staunch the coughing
i tell him when you dream about bad things happening it shows youre still fighting
youre still alive
its when you start to dream about good things you should start to worry
they are trudging along the blacktop adjacent to a railway line
there is a shotgun blast in the distance and the man and the boy stop and look around
the man checks behind him instinctively
pov man a thin spike of smoke from a campfire rising up in the woods behind
the boy notices and looks behind
do you think theyre still following us
i think theyve been following us for a long time
maybe its ely the old man
on a broom stick
the boy thinks about this for a moment as they approach the railway line
the man and the boy are swaddled in blankets up amongst the rocks with a birds eye view of the road and a railway bridge they can see along the
road and the dead trees for half a mile
the boy is nodding off his head lolling as the man keeps watch increasingly paranoid
as they come down from the bluffs the man is staring into the dead woods where another thin stem of smoke is rising
what is it
i think we should take a look
i dont want to
lets just keep going
whoever it is i dont want them behind us
what if theyre bad guys
what if theyre good guys
they look at each other a stalemate
the man stands and starts to pack up the tarp
whoever it is out there its better to know about it than to not know
because we dont like surprises
surprises are scary
they could sneak up on us further down the road
you need to learn this
the man folds the tarp and sleeping blankets and starts heading down the slope to the trolley the boy following
a deserted campsite a campfire recently abandoned
the man and the boy look around disappointed
open country now completely blackened landscape under heavy ash
they are stopped
the boy unfolds the threadbare map on the ground a crayon in his hand
you know where we are
where do you think
the boy points to a place on the map
were closer than you think
he takes the crayon and points on the map
this is us
this is all sea
is it blue
i dont know
it used to be
the man picks up a desiccated pine cone from the ground and stares at it hollow eyed hungry
he squeezes it and it crumbles to dust
he takes a few steps sniffing the air
can you smell that
it smells different
everything is going to be different
the landscape has changed dead salt bush and sand at the side of the road and finally as they come around a bend in the road dead sea grass sloping
up to sand dunes up ahead
they look at each other and head for the dunes excitedly
the man hides the trolley discretely so the boy doesnt see his concern he takes their bags tarps and blankets with them as they head off for the dunes
pov boy gray beach lead gray sea and waves rolling in slowly with a distant roar
on the beach a tide mark of wet gray ashy sludge and a skirt of glistening bones fish skeletons bleached white on the sand
they take their parka hoods down and just stand there staring at the beach the wind howling around them dozens of bleached whale and fish bones and skeletons of humans
who have made it this far only to die
the man looks at the boy and sees the intense disappointment
im sorry its not blue
they sit on the beach wrapped in blankets staring at a surreal wall of impenetrable smog not far beyond where the waves are breaking
the man eyes the silent boy buffeted by wind wrapped in a blanket staring at the empty ocean
there is nothing and nobody there
they keep staring out to sea filled with disappointment
the boy impassively surveys the wall of smog which is like an iron curtain
whats on the other side
there must be something
maybe theres a father and his little boy and theyre sitting on the beach too
and they could be carrying the fire too
they could be yes
the man sees the boys hopefulness reappearing and strokes his head his heart breaking for him
the man and the boy stand with their shoes off the black sea washes up the sand at their filthy blistered feet
what are our long term goals
what are our long term goals
where did you hear that
i dont know
you said it
a long time ago
when your mother was here
and what was the answer
i dont know
well i dont either
they stare at the water charred quotidian household objects rolling back and forth in the surf
can i go swimming
youll freeze your nuts off
i dont want to have to come in after you
the boy lets the blanket fall and strips out of his parka and clothes
he runs along the beach naked skinny and white leaping screaming into the icy surf
the man watches until the boy comes out of the water gasping with cold shuddering
he wraps the boy in the blanket and dries him off
the boy is wrapped in blankets by the fire as lightning flickers in the distance illuminating the empty beach
the man drapes another blanket over them
he puts his arms around the boy who is shivering and sweating looking a little wild eyed babbling a little
how many people do you think are still alive
in the world
i dont know
not very many
there could be people alive someplace else
besides on earth
i dont think so
they couldnt live any place else
not even if they could get there
if they had a a a spaceship
the boy stares shivering thinking
are you all right
what is it
he cups his hand to the babbling boys forehead
i dont feel so good
the boy bends away and vomits and the man helps rubbing his back and wiping the boys mouth when hes done
thats okay you didnt do anything wrong
the man is very worried now
the man covers the boy in more blankets and constructs a makeshift tent with the tarp as the rain falls all around
youre going to be okay
dont leave me here dont go away papa
not even for a minute
i wont go away
im right here
he sits holding the boy tightly
he feels for the boys heart
he drops droplets of sugar water from a bowl into the boys mouth
as the boy shuts his eyes and dozes he checks the pulse at his neck and wipes his mouth with the blanket
the boy is sleeping fitfully across the mans lap he is still awake staring in horror as the boy sweats and shakes in his sleep
he wipes the boys brow looks up to the oh no
jesus christ what have you done to us
what have you done
the boy is fast asleep motionless but for stertorous breathing through his mouth
the man lies beside him just staring at him watching him sleep
the boy opens his eyes and focuses weakly
im right here
the boy shuts his eyes and goes back to sleep
the man strokes the boys hair tenderly takes the pistol from his belt and carefully hides the pistol under the blanket by the boys side
he stands takes one last look and walks away
the man is alone now staring at the hull of a wrecked boat keeled over in ten feet of gray water a few yards out from the spit a sixty
footer twin masts
closer to shore in the shallows between the boat and the sand is a grey lifeless form
the man steps closer and sees pov man bobbing about in the tide the bloated rotting cadaver of a giant squid eyes like dinner plates translucent grey skin like an
old light bulb
the man eyes it uneasily then starts stripping off his clothes
he stares anxiously into the darkly roiling water near the boat
he looks back along the beach to the distant figure of the boy sitting up wrapped in his blankets looking around confused and scared enough to make the man wince
he collects himself and wades cautiously into the gray soupy water
he takes a breath and starts swimming to the boat
the boy is confused as he watches pov boy the man swimming away
mystery pov over the shoulder of a mystery third person camera pushes in slightly on the boy sleeping
a figures feet enters the scene behind the boy carefully walks in close around the boy
the figures long knife drops into the scene held at the figures side
the boy senses the figure and wakes up to see pov boy a dark hunched figure standing over him
the boy looks up at the face and whatever it is hes terrified
the boy shrieks terrified scrambling away tripping over pots and pans by the fire he gets to his feet and runs
the man struggles from the water and scans the beach no sign of the boy
he dumps a medical kit and flare pistol hes found on the boat and heads for the sand dunes
the man runs over the sand and reaches the spot where he left the boy the blue tarp blowing away across the beach the campsite and campfire disturbed
he runs up the dunes
pov boy as he looks back he glimpses ragged feet rushing through the sand after him a pair of hands reaching out
pov man he catches up with the boy grabs his shoulder with one hand and the gun with the other
reverse angle the boy sees its the man and stops stares still frightened feverish wild eyed confused
its okay a man
there was a man
i saw a man
its okay hes gone now its just me
the boy collapses exhausted into the mans arms
the man and the boy return to examine the disturbed campsite
you stupid ass
you stupid ass
he stole our shoes
he stole everything
the boy goes quiet forlorn staring around at the desolation in despair
i dont know what were doing
i dont know why were doing this
look there are
he trails off lost for words
there are people
there are other people and well find them
the boy just shuts his eyes and slumps onto the sand in despair
the man eyes him anxiously
listen to me
dont lose heart
the man seizes the flare gun takes it from its case hurriedly loads it with shells the boy now watches wide eyed
the man rushes a few paces up the dune and looks over to where the trolley was hidden he fires a flare into the air
the flare arcs up into the murk with a long whoosh and breaks in a cloud of light hanging there hot tendrils of magnesium drifting down to the sand
the boy watches curious despite his despair
the man strains his eyes to see the dunes bathed in pink light from the flare and the sand pock marked with the footprints of the strange man in a
trail leading to the spot where the trolley
the trolley marks trail off into the distance
mystery pov from a distance a third party is watching the man and boy bathed in the light of the flare
camera pushes in on the face watching them bearded and scarred with a wandering eye and a crushed cheekbone a veteran of many skirmishes
the man and the boy stand in their bare feet
we have to get our shoes back
we dont need them
we wont get far without them
they set off hurriedly in their bare feet
on the road in the middle of a desolate landscape the light is dying the strange lattice of lightning flickering across the sky the man and the boy are barefoot
on the tarmac
pov man way up ahead is the hunched figure seen earlier the thief his back to us trundling the loaded trolley along the road
they take off after the thief bare feet thudding on the tarmac the man in front the boy trailing trying to catch up
the thief looks back at them and speeds up head bent down over the handle running for his life
when he looks back again the man has drawn his pistol and is aiming it directly at him
the thief stops the trolley pulls a carving knife from his belt and turns to face them standing behind the trolley
his face is emaciated and twitchy a mouth like a bombed grave yard not the face of the man watching them in the sand dunes
the man trains his gun on him stock still holding the boys hand
get away from the cart and put the knife down
the man spits and brandishes the knife desperately hes scrawny sullen bearded and filthy
if you dont put down the carving knife and get away from the godamn cart im going to blow your brains out
the man cocks the pistol and theres two loud clicks
god damn you
papa please dont kill the man
come on man i done what you said listen to the boy
the boy starts crying the thief looks at the boy and then the angry man this seems to be sobering
he puts the knife in the trolley and steps away hands in the air his thumbs are missing
how long have you been following us
i wasnt following you
i saw the cart on the sand an i just took it
take your clothes off
take them off every godamn stitch
come on man dont do this
ill kill you where you stand
dont do this man
i wont tell you again
all right all right just take it easy
the thief looks at the boy who is now covering his ears and the man takes an intimidating step closer with the gun
the thief starts stripping and piling his rags in the road
come on man
he sits naked in the road and unlaces the rotting shoes
put them in the cart
the thief stands and drops the shoes in the trolley
put the clothes in
the man drops the clothes in and stands there covering himself shivering
dont do me like this man
you dont need to do me like this
you didnt mind doing it to us
im begging you
come on listen to the kid
you tried to kill us
im starving man
youd have done the same
you took everything
ill die out here
im going to leave you the way you left us
the man grabs the trolley by the handle pulls it around puts the pistol on top and holds his hand out for the boy
the boy doesnt take his hand but they set off along the blacktop the boy snivelling and crying leaving the thief shivering and whimpering
i cant stop it
what do you think would have happened to him if we hadnt caught him
youve got to learn
i dont want to learn
i wont be here forever
sooner or later youll have to look after yourself
the boy just looks at him and keeps crying
some distance away the boy looks back at the thief still crying
you have to stop crying
the boy looks back one last time as the thief disappears from view still just standing there utterly lost
the man stops and puts his shoes on
he walks back up the road to the bend but the thief has gone
hes not gone
the man looks helplessly at the tearful boy as he fits his shoes on for him the tears streaking the soot on his face
what do you want to do
just help him papa
just help him
the man looks back down the road weighing it up
he was just hungry papa
hes going to die
hes going to die anyway
hes so scared
do you understand
the man tries to look the boy in the eye but he keeps his head bowed sobbing
youre not the one who has to worry about everything
the boy mumbles tearful and snotty
what did you say
yes i am
i am the one
the man stops and faces the innocent boy angrily stares then relenting summons all his strength turns the trolley around and they start wheeling it back the way they came
the man takes the boys hand and puts it on the trolley handle
as the light fades to darkness they look for the thief to give him his clothes back and call out hallo
after a moment they stop
hes afraid to answer
is this where we stopped
i dont know
i think so
they keep walking hands cupped to mouths hallooing mindlessly
the man stops to rest and watches the boy a moment he has stopped crying as he calls out for the thief
finally the man piles the thiefs shoes and clothes in the road
he puts a rock on top of them
we have to go
the boy eyes the clothes sadly silent now
they find a spot to stop and sit exhausted
the man opens the first aid kit he took from the boat selects various pills crushes them up pours a cup of water from a ferry can in the trolley
and hands them to the boy
i dont want it
i have to get your temperature down
the boy swallows the pills and the water shivering
can i ask you something
of course you can
what would you do if i died
if you died id want to die too
so you could be with me
so i could be with you yes
but thats not going to happen
they look at each other a moment unsure the boy shivering and sick looking
the boy lies down and shuts his eyes
the man puts a blanket over him
the man walks away a few paces and coughs endlessly a nagging cough that wont go
the mans dream a dream and a memory of an early summer day the man and the woman are in an orchard lying in the sun on a picnic blanket
an array of food bread fruit and wine beside them
the man lies back and the woman cradles his head in her lap stroking his brow
she brings her face down and gently plants a simple kiss on each of his eyelids then on each of his lips
pov man the womans face smiling a dazzling radiant smile framed by sunlight and the indistinct shapes of leaves and blossom and petals against the sky to him she is
then he kisses her on each eye and on the lips too their ritual caress
the man awakes distressed he wipes a tear blinks in confusion
pov man the boy is kneeling beside him watching him calmly no longer sweating and shivering recovered
the man rouses himself sits up and just stares at the boy amazed as if he has arisen from the grave how are you feeling
i feel kind of weird
are you hungry
the man gets up and fetches water from a ferry can in the trolley pours a cup hands it to the boy who drinks thirstily
the man reaches out and strokes the boys hair as he drinks
the man and the boy head towards a seaside town off in the distance
they enter a small beach resort with a faded welcome sign across the road the boy holding the mans hand now
they are down by the water
small pleasure boats are half sunken in the grey water
faded colored bunting and painted signs advertise ice creams food and a fun fair
the boy helps the man push the trolley through the sand until they can go no further they stop and drop onto the sand exhausted
can i tell you something
you tell me i shouldnt cry but ive heard you crying
i hear you coughing and crying to yourself in the night when you think im asleep
what of it
so if i shouldnt cry you shouldnt cry either
they look at each other
on the port side of town the man wheels the trolley through the deserted docks past rotten piers a row of empty wooden warehouses and a rusty red tanker washed
he is coughing and the sound echoes off the warehouse walls
the boy is trailing a few paces behind theyre not speaking now
as they pass the last of a row of deserted warehouses the man slows down to let the boy catch up
but the boy is now studying the ground intently
he bends down and picks up pov boy an old cardboard match box its decals faded
he pushes the match box open to reveal a perfectly preserved beetle
what is it
its a beetle
suddenly the beetle twitches then activates its wings and flies out of the box with a buzz and upwards into the sky
the boy and the man stare up at the flying creature amazed without warning something whistles over their heads very close and hits the wall beside them with a loud
the man lunges at the boy landing on top of him to cover him and tries to grab the trolley which tips over spilling everything out
the man desperately tries to take cover while he looks over his shoulder and sees pov man in the upper window of a warehouse a man is drawing a bow
and arrow aimed right at them
in desperation the man covers the boy and tries to scrabble away but theres a dull twang of bowstring and an arrow thuds into his leg
oh you bastard
the man claws the blankets from the upturned trolley aside and scrabbles around for the pistol but it has fallen from his belt onto the cobbles and scattered out of
he spots the flare gun and seizes it resting it on the trolley and aiming carefully at the empty window
when the lone archer appears again he squeezes off a shot and the flare goes rocketing up towards the window in a firey arc ablaze with color clean through the
they can hear the archer screaming inside and see the colored light still flaring from the window
stay just like you are
he gets up and runs limping across the street the arrow still embedded in his leg
he limps up the stairs of the old warehouse as quickly as he can flare gun at the ready arrow in his leg
he bursts into the main room and trains the gun
at the far end a woman is sitting with the prone form of the archer
the floor is burnt in a huge patch left by the flare and is still in flames
you son of a bitch
who else is up here
you fucking asshole
the man looks down his leg is bleeding heavily now and the arrow is still sticking out
wheres the bow
i dont have it
why are you following us
were not following anybody
you were following us
the man stares at the woman looking her up and down she looks sick and thin and desperate
he looks at the archer lying there dead his chest and one arm and his face burnt still smoking
the woman covers his face with the blanket and the man doesnt know what to say ashamed
pov again from a distance as if a third party is watching we watch the boy and the man hobble into a cafe
one wall of the cafe is merely a pile of rubble opening out to the sea
the opposite wall is a photographic mural of lush green woods
the man tries to pull the arrow out but just pulls the wooden stem out
he takes off his bloodied trousers and examines the gaping wound with a flap of flesh and the arrow head made from a spoon buried inside
see if you can find the medical kit from the boat
the boy rummages in the trolley finds the kit and hands it over
he stares as the man slowly extracts the spoon wincing in agony
the man dowses the wound in antiseptic from the kit and searches through the kit for a needle
he finds a suture needle in a sterile envelope rips it open with his teeth and using the light coming in through the parlour windows he threads some silk thread
into the needle
he starts to suture up the wound grimacing in pain as the boy watches in silence until eventually offering does it hurt
the man just looks at him in disbelief beat
what does it feel like
the man eyes the boy amazed at this inopportune chat
at least youre talking to me now
they have a campfire in the cafe by the jetty and sit overlooking the bay through the missing wall silent until do you want me to tell you a story
your stories arent true
they dont have to be true
in the stories were always helping people
but we dont help people
we just shoot people
and in the stories good things happen but we just get sick
the man thinks about it stuck for an answer
were still here arent we
doesnt that mean anything
the man pulls the trolley slowly finding it a great effort
the boy helps pull eying the man with concern
the man stops and rests on the trolley and the boy pulls on a few more feet then stops and looks back as the man coughs for a long painful
he takes the bloodstained surgical mask from his face his breath foggy in the cold he wrings out the blood and saliva puts his head between his knees and coughs
until he can cough no more gasping for breathe bloody drool unspooling from his lips into the sand like scarlet twine while the boy watches weeping silently
we have to leave the cart
i cant push it anymore
they are trudging along a concrete boat ramp by the beach road the beach below the boy carrying a small suitcase now the man carrying sacks and bags
they stop and the man leans impossibly breathless his lungs packing up
they stop at the water edge where the road reaches the sea
the boy takes his hand gently
what are we going to do papa
the man cant answer for breathlessness
well what are we
the man sits heavily on the ground totters as the boy stands watching him eyes welling with tears
oh no papa
the man is drifting in and out of consciousness in the sand
the boy comes over with a cup of water and holds it to the mans lips he drinks
the boy has also lit a fire
he spreads out blankets
dont get comfortable
you need to keep going
you dont know what might be down the road
we were always lucky
youll be lucky again
its all right
this has been a long time coming
just keep going south
do everything the way we did it
youre going to be okay papa
you have to
keep the gun with you at all times
dont let anyone take it from you
you need to find the good guys but you cant take any chances
do you hear me
i want to be with you
i want to be with you too but i cant
you have to go off on your own now
you have to carry the fire
i dont know how to
yes you do
you know everything about it
is it real
yes it is
where is it
i dont know where it is
yes you do
its inside you
it was always there
i can see it
the boy stares at him not sure what to believe
you have to let me go
just take me with you please
what should i do
just hold my hand
the boy grips the mans hand bouncing up and down agitated
you said you wouldnt ever leave me
the boy falls on the man hugging him tight face pressed to his chest sobbing
you have my whole heart
you always did
youre the best guy
you can talk to me and ill talk to you
how will i hear you
you just will
how do you know
you just have to practice
just dont give up okay
youll be okay
youre going to be lucky
i know you are
the man closes his eyes and takes deep rattling breaths
its okay papa
you dont have to talk anymore
camera pulls back and the boy is sitting with the man saying nothing
its starting to grow dark
the boy crouches down on the mans chest and goes to sleep there rising and falling with his fathers breathing
darkness all around the boy is lying across the man his hand rising and falling on the mans chest slowly irregularly as the mans breath rattles in his lungs
flashback or the mans last ever dream the man and the woman snooze in the car an ordinary young couple nestled together in the early morning sun light
the man wakes and looks at his sleeping wife smooths her hair tenderly very much in love as she sleeps
his hand on her wakes her she looks at him surprised and pleased smiles
she kisses him and they look at the blue ocean and the white sand and green sea grass and she puts an arm around him
if i were god i would have made the world just so and no different
and so i have you
i have you
the boy is awake but doesnt move his hand still on the mans chest now motionless
he looks at the man who is cold and stiff now long dead
the boy gets up and holds the mans cold stiff hand
tears course down his face silently
the boy is building a campfire
he lights it and sits there watching the mans motionless body
the boy has slept beside the man he wakes blinks bewildered
the boy is zipping up the mans parka carefully and heaping blankets on top talking all the while
can i tell you something
i had a bad dream
i had this penguin that you wound up and it would waddle and flap its flippers
and we were in that house we used to live in and it came around the corner but nobody had wound it up and it was really scary because because
he goes quiet as he finishes tending to the body and puts his own parka on zips it up
the winder wasnt turning
he takes the gun checks the magazine shuts it and stands shoving the pistol in his belt
the boy is standing at the waters edge looking out at the smog and the emptiness
out of nowhere a man in a gray and red ski parka with the hood up appears carrying a shotgun over his shoulder and a belt of shells
he goes over to the boy he is the same bearded and scarred man seen earlier watching them in the sand dunes
the boy doesnt flinch but his hand goes to the gun at his side
when the man speaks he has some sort of speech defect possibly caused by missing teeth
wheres the man you were with
was he your father
he was my papa
i dont know what to do
well i think maybe you should come with me
the boys finger tightens on the trigger of the gun
are you one of the good guys
im one of the good guys
why dont you put that pistol away
im not supposed to let anybody take the pistol
no matter what
i dont want your pistol
i just didnt want you pointing it at me
the boy lowers the gun to his side and the veteran comes a few steps closer causing the boy to back up a step
wheres your stuff
i dont have much stuff
what have you got
my papas wrapped in them
the boy doesnt move
the man holds out his hand for the boy to take the boy sees he has a thumb missing and hesitates wary
the man squats leaning on his shotgun
you got two choices here
you can stay here with your papa or you can go with me
if you stay you need to keep off the road
how do i know youre one of the good guys
youll have to take a shot
the boy weighs it up eyeing the veteran
do you have any kids
yes we do
do you have a little boy
we have a little boy and a little girl
how old is he
hes about your age
maybe a little older
and you didnt eat them
you dont eat people
we dont eat people
are you carrying the fire
am i what
carrying the fire
youre kind of weirded out arent you kid
well are you
im carrying the fire
and i can go with you
yes you can
the boy hesitates
they go over to where the man lies dead and the veteran squats and lifts a blanket to take a look
are these all the blankets you have
is that your suitcase
the veteran stands and studies the boy
why dont you go up onto the road and wait for me
ill bring the blankets
what about my papa
what about him
we cant just leave him here
yes we can
i dont want people to see him
theres nobody to see him
can i cover him in leaves
the wind will blow them away
could we cover him with one of the blankets
ill do it
go on now
the boy waits and in a moment the veteran emerges from the dunes carrying the suitcase with the blankets slung over his shoulder
he sorts through them and hands one to the boy
wrap this around you
the boy eye the blanket uncertainly holds out the pistol for the veteran to hold
you hold onto that
do you know how to shoot it
what about my papa
theres nothing else to be done
i think i want to say goodbye to him
will you be all right
ill wait here for you
the boy turns around and heads down to the beach
the boy trudges through the sand over to the corpse of the man which is now neatly wrapped up in a blanket from head to toe
the boy kneels beside him and starts to cry silently and whisper
ill talk to you every day
and i wont forget
no matter what
no matter what papa
the boy dries his eyes takes a breath gets up and walks back to the road
as the boy walks out of the dunes holding the gun a motherly woman who is standing with the veteran comes towards him
i am so glad to see you
the boy just stares at her bemused a short distance away stands the rest of the family a boy his age and a girl
the boy stares at the other boy and recognizes him its the same boy he chased earlier
then the boy notices a threadbare mongrel of a dog waiting with them
the motherly woman goes over and puts her arms around him
weve been following you
did you know that
we saw you with your papa and we tried to catch up but you were too quick for us
there was some discussion about whether to even come after you at all
as shes chatting the motherly woman gently takes the gun from the boy and hands it to the veteran
were so lucky
we were so worried about you
and now we dont have to worry about a thing
she kisses the boy on the forehead and holds him at arms length and looks at him
how does that sound
is that okay
he stares but says nothing
