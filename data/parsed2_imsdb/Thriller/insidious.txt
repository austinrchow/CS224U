written by leigh whannell the universe is deathless is deathless because having no finite self it stays infinite
a sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead of himself by not confining himself to himself sustains himself outside himself
a spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface
white like the moon
in the darkness the towers metal skin is barely visible
we rotate around revealing the tower to actually be a lamp not rising up from a surface but hanging down from a white ceiling
the bulb unlit
directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence a sleeping child
chest rising and falling with each breath
we hover over the young boy
a blanket emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs
his mouth is slack eyelids twitching to dreams unseen
the truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for
we move away from him exploring the dark room
strewn with toys
the door is slightly ajar
we float through it into a long hallway
even darker than the bedroom
and without the boys rhythmic breathing even quieter
a window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach
someone is standing in front of it
the murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away
we follow it tentative
turning a corner we see the figure
standing in a doorway
now we can make out the edges of the person
it is an old woman
hair in a victorian bun
a corseted dress
she stares at us
let me in
opening titles play out to the shrill screams of george crumbs black angels i night of the electric insects
eyes flick open
a woman blinks awake gazing around the room
just a bed and a cabinet
her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark
his heaving snores have woken her up
she is renai pronounced renee lambert
with a quiet determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks but the lines of age are creeping in
she has settled into the comfort years of a marriage hair pinned up messily wearing dowdy pajamas
she beholds her husband taking him in
he snorts and smacks his lips
she climbs out of bed
spanish style windows
renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living room
no matter careful she is there is a loud creak with each step
a grandfather clock in the corner ticks steadily
there is barely any furniture in here only a bookcase and a piano
what there is a lot of
large moving boxes
renai plops cross legged onto the floor and rips open one of the boxes marked books
she plucks out a handful of books and lines them up on the bookshelf
then another handful
they are all self help and self improvement books
titles like be the better you and inch by inch its a cinch a guide to achieving your goals pop out
she spots a sealed box labelled photo albums
she strips away the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos
smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages
the happy couple
sadness washes over her
she snaps out of it and turns to see dalton lambert
he approaches her rubbing his eyes
it is not the boy we saw in the opening scene
what are you doing up kiddo
i dont like my room
youll get used to it
its only your first night
he climbs into her lap
she bites on his ear playfully
argh im going to eat you
what are you looking at
just some photos
she hefts another album from the box prying it open
a photo of a grinning young girl greets them hair in pigtails
do you know who that is
it doesnt look like you
im so happy there
but its me
when i was your age
i was a kid once too you know
no you werent
renai bursts out laughing
she is famous for her big laugh
maybe youre right
i dont remember being this person at all
i hope she smiled like that all the time whoever she was
she sizes up her son
the living embodiment of the photo
this is a terrible thing to admit dalton but sometimes i get jealous of you
that youre so young
that you havent made any of your decisions yet
i dont wanna grow old
well it starts happening to us from the moment were born
she points to the hands on the grandfather clock
every time that clock ticks we all get a little bit older
she turns the page in the photo album seeing an old man
thats your grandpa
you wouldnt remember him
he smells like smoke
he did smoke that god awful pipe didnt he
show me a picture of dad when he was a little kid
i dont even know if we have any
hes hopeless with keeping photos
show me a picture of me when i was a little kid
your pictures are all in the computer
nobody keeps photo albums like this anymore theyre ancient relics
i like being able to touch something instead of it floating around in cyber world
if the laptop breaks your whole existence is erased
what was i like when i was a little kid
you are a little kid
she kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes
if only you knew what i know
we hear a baby crying off screen
you certainly didnt cry as much as your little sister does
boxes of dinnerware have not been unpacked yet and it is turning the usual morning routine into a nightmare
renai is on the phone as her kids buzz around a kitchen island at top speed creating a high energy manic pace in the room
her son foster tugs on her leg holding a box of cereal
i need a bowl mom
renai rips open a box rifling through newspaper phone wedged against her shoulder
she holds out a cup flustered
its too small
make it work
speak to an agent
speak to an agent
speak to an agent
foster slumps on the floor pouring cereal and overflowing milk into the cup
a baby girl in a high chair cali squeals
josh lambert gapes into the mirror face covered in soap
he washes it off
now hes awake we see that he is a handsome clean cut guy a former high school nerd who got revenge by growing into his body
he sorts through a box labelled joshs bathroom stuff
he takes out two bottles toner and moisturizer
he dabs the toner on then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and around his eyes
he suddenly notices a grey hair
michael corleone voice every time i think ive pulled you out
you grow back in
he plucks it out wincing melodramatically
josh strides in tie hanging open around his neck
renai is still on the phone
josh points to his tie
well id like to keep the old number if i could
you really need to learn how to do this honey
she threads the tie into a knot for him
dont eat on the floor buddy
foster stays where he is slurping cereal from the cup
dalton is playing a handheld videogame
okay well please let me know by the end of today i have to give the number out
she hangs up pissed
foster get up
foster frowns and obeys
how come you were up so early
was cali crying
you woke me up
what do you mean
you were snoring
no i wasnt
yes you were
i dont snore
yes you do
my father snored
i do not snore
how would you know what you do
renai marches out of the room
daltons game unit beeps loudly and he pumps his fist
i made it to the last level
ever amiable josh high fives his son
good one champ
i dont snore do i
renai sees that all the books she unpacked earlier are now scattered across the floor of the living room
where are my bleeping pills
renai charges in
josh snatches an apple out of a fruit bowl biting into it
he quickly gags and spits it out into the sink
what the heck is this
let me get this straight we have no actual fruit but we have wax fruit
that is dangerous
it could kill one of our kids
where are my pills josh
probably where you left them renai
she finds them on the counter snatching them up
thats not where i left them
mom i need my lunch
take last nights dinner
she opens the fridge
it is bare except for a box of sushi
aw thats weirdo food
its all we have
just for today honey
check it first dalton
its probably made out of styrofoam
and while ive got you if youre going to look at my books please dont leave them all over the floor
i didnt touch your books
josh streaks past kissing renai on the cheek
i gotta go
are you taking the boys to school
well can you pick them up after school
but i have stuff i wanted to
she trails off
can i have another cup mom
noisy students settle into their desks
inner city kids mostly hispanic
josh is their teacher scribbling on the blackboard
one student a lanky boy alanso hovers near the door
alanso please sit down
sientate por favor
alanso takes a seat
josh is having trouble getting control
come on guys quieten down
a pretty girl in the front teri is annoyed at the class
you better all shut up
she commands respect
except for one kid
just cos youre in love
thank you teri
today we are going to talk about darwin
its a city in australia but its also the last name of which famous naturalist
does anybody know what he is famous for
he said that people descended from monkeys
he wrote a seminal book that explained his theories on natural selection and how the different species on this planet including humans evolved
i know i didnt evolve from no monkey
humans actually have a lot in common with monkeys or more specifically chimpanzees
maybe you do but i was created in the image of my dios
he takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his shirt kissing it and holding it up
that gets another laugh
i respect your right to believe that alanso
but i want to give you all possible theories
i want this class to go out into the world with an informed opinion
the theory is incorrect mr
how can it be incorrect
its a theory
a scientific theory
yeah well science is bullshit
we didnt get here cos of no test tubes
alanso if you keep talking like that im going to ask you to visit the principal
he gets up and leaves as the class jeers and boos
peace and quiet at last
renai gropes in behind the bookcase plucking a hidden jewelry box free
she pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it
she sits down at her piano feeling the keys warming her fingers up
sunlight streams in through the windows
she takes out a notebook filled with scribbled handwriting
she places the notebook on the sheetstand then sets a small mechanical metronome in motion and begins tapping out a sombre melody in time with it
yeah im looking west always been looking that way gonna get it all happening just cant do it today
she stops and makes a note in her book
she starts over rising to the emotion of the song
shes got a good voice
yeah im looking west always been looking that way im gonna be somebody i just cant be her today she is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying
she stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor the source of the noise
renai deflates her shoulders sagging in defeat
she closes her notebook and leaves the room
renai scoops up cali rocking her gently
a scratching sound interrupts
like a dog pawing at something
renai steps into the hall curious
she can still hear it
she follows the sound to a door
grabs the door handle
the sound abruptly ceases
the door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of stairs that descend into a gloomy basement
renai stands at the top of the stairs squinting into the inky blackness straining to see
she reaches up and yanks a light chain illuminating a bare bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space
the basement is large and completely bare
renai takes a step down
she is still carrying cali
further down below her we see that there is one step that is cracked and broken
she takes another step
the broken step is right below her now
one more step and she will fall
cali squeals happily
then turns around heading back up the stairs
stops when she sees something
deep violent scratch marks
running downwards on the inside of the door
as if someone were trying to claw their way out
a spanish style home
this is not the suburbs
more of an inner city neighborhood
theres history here
josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his subaru
the house almost looks liveable
foster is watching loud zany cartoons on tv
cali is in a high chair
renai is folding boxes
she has unpacked most of the living room and is very tired
josh ambles in sees the work renai has done
look at this
foster bolts over and crashes into his dads legs hugging him
josh wheres the box of my lamps
i dont know
they should be here
we packed them up
yeah i packed them
theyre not here
i remember the movers bringing them in and putting them right there
well theyre not here
i would know ive been unpacking this stuff all day
dalton wanders the hall sporting a red superhero cape and carrying a plastic glowing light sabre toy
he reaches a door
the basement door
he pulls it open
dalton holds up his light sabre the glow allowing him to make out the murky corners of the basement below
he takes a step down the stairs
then another step
the broken step is right below him
he steps again and falls
flails forward tumbling down the steps all the way to the bottom
his light sabre shatters
he hits the ground his head smacking the floor
all is dark
josh sits with foster zoned out in front of the droning tv
dazed dalton sits up
his head is cut and bleeding
he is alone in the dark
he stares into the corner of the surrounding cell
his eyes adjust making out a shape
josh and renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a scream
they spring into action scrambling to their feet
where are you
he doesnt answer
just keeps screaming
renai and josh whip the door open glaring into the basement from the top of the stairs
dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps sobbing his red cape gathered around him
renai flicks the light on
her and josh scamper down the steps propping dalton up
dalton you have to be careful
you shouldnt be coming down here in the dark
where do you hurt the most
my knee and my head
i cant stand up
josh lifts him to his feet
a severely grazed knee is dotted with blood
you scared us champ
josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs
renai glances around the basement her eyes landing on the lone object that resides in it
it wasnt there when she saw the basement last
it is a box
one of her large cardboard moving boxes
it is marked lamps
dalton is lying in bed a band aid slapped across his forehead
renai tucks him in josh standing over him
youre lucky you dont need stitches
if i catch you falling down the stairs again im gonna break your neck
that doesnt make sense
there are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall all drawn by dalton
josh taps one a drawing of dalton flying through the night sky wearing his cape
you might be a superhero but youre not invincible
be more careful bud
renai kisses him and gets up
sleep tight honey
they wave goodbye and turn out the light
renai flops into bed beside josh exhausted
weve gotta lock that door
hes such a boy
he goes off exploring
sometimes i wanna keep him on one of those child leashes
why bother with a child leash
ill stop at the pet store tomorrow
she laughs and cuddles up to him resting her head on his chest
im sorry i was pissy when you got home
i was trying to work on a song today and then cali woke up and wouldnt stop crying
i didnt even notice
i feel guilty for wanting my own time
its normal to want your own time
my mother gave up everything for me
i keep waiting for the completely selfless parent gene to kick in but im exactly the same person i was when i was only now im married with kids
youre a great mother
no im not
they like you so much better than me
thats not true
youre the cool dad who comes home with presents and im the one who yells at them all day
now youre being crazy
they love you
at least you get to connect with them
i work so much
believe me youre their hero
they try to play us off against each other
theyre master manipulators
i guess they really are my kids
a lull settles over them
is this it josh
is this so bad
she doesnt answer
they sit in silence for a long beat
thank you for letting me take some time off to work on my music again
well get by
i want you to do it
theres a couple of songs
i mean not all of them but theres a couple of them that i think are really good
and i think maybe i could do something with them
i love all your songs
it is am
all the remoteness of that hour is present here
we can feel it
as still and quiet as deep space
the formerly bustling kitchen is now a museum at midnight
a long dark thoroughfare
a ticking clock its only occupant
stairs swallowed up by darkness
the groan of settling wood
the soft breathing of a sleeping child
hanging toy birds dangle over the baby tinkling in a breeze
dalton is sleeping too
lying on his back
renai and josh are entwined together
josh is snoring
they are both blissfully asleep
another day another chaotic breakfast
foster waves a stuffed toy around
josh charges in bits of tissue on his face from shaving cuts
cali flails her arms in her high chair
renai is at the sink whisking eggs
foster sit down honey
she whips a look around
hey josh could you go wake up dalton
we follow josh as he marches down the corridor to daltons bedroom poking his head inside
josh knocks on the wall
time to get up my man
nothing from dalton
he doesnt even stir
josh rolls his eyes and walks in
nudges dalton with his knee
youre making me look bad here
outta bed before your mother comes in and kills both of us
hes really out
josh reaches down and shakes dalton vigorously
dalton get up
youve gotta get ready for school
josh waits for a response but none comes
dalton is as slack as a puppet
something resembling concern crosses joshs face
he kneels down shaking dalton hard
he listens for breathing
his scream takes us into the stern sterility of a hospital
josh and renai eyes lined by dark circles stand in front of a dour neurologist dr
renai dabs her eyes with a tissue
they are red with tears
beyond a window in front of them lying on a gurney in an icu chamber is the unconscious body of dalton
as of yet our tests have not drawn any conclusive answers for you
repeated blood and csf cultures are normal making an infective origin highly unlikely
tests for lyme disease and repeated polymerase chain reaction are negative
systemic vasculitis was ruled out
dalton remains in an areactive coma without focal signs or abnormal brainstem reflexes
josh and renai struggle to follow the cold multi syllable medical terminology
like stranded tourists keeping up with a foreign language
weve looked for bacterial pathogens like meningoencephalitis but havent seen anything
i wouldnt say weve exhausted every single angle
but were close
the underlying cause is still unknown
josh and renai look in at their boy
the good news is that hes breathing without the use of a mechanical apparatus and there are no lesions or hemorrhages in any of the ct scans
theres no brain damage or
none that weve detected
technically hes in a coma
he doesnt respond to stimuli he has no sleep wake cycle but theres no brain trauma or infection
his scans are normal
to be honest ive never seen anything like it
that fall he took
i mean it looked like he hit his head pretty hard
we definitely exhausted that possibility but it was always doubtful
the cut was superficial there wasnt even a skull fracture
he cant just not wake up
theres got to be something
renai sobs tears streaming down her face
josh looks like a deer in the headlights
sercarz clears his throat
this part of the job isnt his specialty
so what do we do now
does he stay here
well conduct some further testing but beyond that
i really dont know
his pager goes off
he checks it
excuse me for a minute
i have to step out
a nurse will be with you in just a moment
he leaves quickly
josh and renai press on the glass separated in body and spirit from their son
a ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom
dalton lies on his bed a heart rate monitor hooked to his chest
iv tubes run into his arms a nasogastric feeding tube into his mouth
a young nurse adele chalfin checks the various tubes as renai watches on
are you having any more trouble with the feeding tube
renai looks broken the life drained from her
a wilted flower
she shakes her head her voice a low rasp
alright well ill be back soon
ill bring some new books
youre probably sick of the ones you have
did he respond to any of the tests
no he didnt
but we have to give it time
ive seen coma patients with a much longer inactivity time suddenly start making noises
hes not in a coma remember
they dont know what to call it
they dont know what to do with him so theyve given up
no they havent
were going to figure it out
adele hugs her then exits
renai slumps down on a chair next to her son
the heart rate monitor pings
dalton is as still as a statue
renai shuffles down the corridor
she passes a bedroom door then stops and doubles back pushing it open and going into the babies room
she stares into the crib
at her other sleeping baby
she sets the baby monitor and walks out softly
renai slumps in front of her piano
taps one of the keys
she plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand not present enough to hear it
she stops and buries her face in her hands
then she hears it
its so low you would miss it if the house wasnt absolutely silent
renai looks up scanning for the source of the murmur
it is coming from the baby monitor
confused renai picks up the monitor turning up the volume all the way up
the hissssssss of static fills the room
she presses her ear to the device then hears it again a hushed whisper almost indistinct from the static save for the whistle of sibilants
they see us
all of us
we have to be quick
this life begs us to come back
the whisper trails off
renai drops the baby monitor leaping out of her skin at the sound of the scream
the monitor smashes on the floor
all is quiet
renai moves to the door staring down the corridor at the door to calis nursery
it is open only a crack
she hears crying
cali is crying
we follow her as she bolts towards the nursery smashing through the door eyes filled with terror seeing nothing
renai stalks into the room
the room is empty save for cali crying in her crib
renais eyes land on the closet
through a slight crack we see renai approach
her hand reaches out
she flings the door open
it is empty
the family is eating
its very quiet
foster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence
suddenly cali breaks the quiet squealing happily
josh looks up smiling
she said dad
neither renai nor foster even look up
a bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow
renai gathers up scattered toys from the floor relocating them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment
foster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar system
renai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate crumpled next to a school bag
it says in recognition of science whats this
thats todays date
you got this today
foster nods meekly
why didnt you tell us honey
she sits on the edge of his bed
he stares at the wall
she strokes his hair
i know its hard right now
but things will get better
im going to show this to your dad
she plants a kiss his forehead and stands up
im scared mom
scared of what
renai sits back down
were all scared
its normal to be scared for him
but we cant give up why do i have to sleep so close to him
cant i change rooms
why would you wanna change rooms
i dont know
renai stares at her son
she kisses him again
your brother needs you
josh lies in bed reading fosters award
renai is beside him
something happened today
i didnt want to tell you in front of foster
i heard something coming from calis room
a mans voice
on the baby monitor
it scared the hell outta me
i went in there and no one was there
could it have been interference
i dont know
it was so clear
i was sitting at the piano and i heard this
whispering on the baby monitor
so i held my ear up to it
suddenly a noise interrupts
an arrhythmic knocking sound like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing
it is the front door
who the hell is that
josh knows its his job to check but he doesnt want to
he gets up
josh approaches the front door flashlight in hand
he peers through curtains at the front step
its too dark to see anything
only the wind replies
he aims the flashlight at the glass shining it into the thick darkness
there is no one on the front step
josh presses the flashlight against the window arcing the beam across his front garden
leans in close to the glass
theres no one there
he makes sure the door is locked then flips open a security system panel on the wall pecking at the buttons on it
renai sits up in bed listening
until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the baby monitor
renai hurls the sheet aside
renai pads down the hall tentative
she reaches the open door to calis room
sees the silhouette of josh standing over calis crib
exhales with relief
who was it josh
josh appears at the opposite end of the hallway
what did you say
renai screams as the silhouette recedes into the shadows
theres someone in there
she runs towards josh
theres someone in calis room
josh bolts down the hall flicking on the light terrified
the nursery is empty
cali is sleeping
terrified josh enters the room
only toys and colorful wallpaper
he steps in further
hes not cut out for this
the house alarm screams to deafening life shaving a few years off joshs life in the process
he jolts whipping around
grab cali and foster
josh charges down the hall into the snatching up a fire poker from the fireplace and continuing to the front door which is swinging open
holding the fire poker aloft josh scans the area
renai races past carrying cali and dragging foster behind her
they barrel toward daltons room
josh scans the kitchen
it is empty
the alarm wails in the background
josh inches his way up the hall hand shaking
renai holds foster and cali close to her
dalton is lying behind them
directly across from daltons room is the laundry
the door is ajar offering a view into the darkened room beyond
renai sees something in the dark
it looks like dalton
he reaches out to renai until another hand
a pale hand
reaches across and shuts the laundry door sealing the boy off from her view
josh bolts up the hall panicked
he reaches the laundry door grabbing the handle
he propels the door open with a shove flicking on the light
the room is empty
no windows no doors for escape
just a washing machine and a dryer
a home security officer trudges down the steps of the house
renai josh foster and cali all stand outside in their pajamas shivering in the frigid night air
theres no one in there its all clear
if someone was there theyre gone now
renai steps away from the children out of their earshot
i saw somebody
maybe it was a shadow
it wasnt a shadow it was a man
he was tall and he long greasy hair
he was wearing a grey jacket
he looked right at me
well like i said
hes gone now
renai looks to the others
sees only disbelieving faces
joshs students scuffle about on stadium seating arranging themselves for a class photo
theyre not doing a great job
a male photographer does his best to compose them not doing a great job of hiding his bitterness about the fact that hes shooting school photos instead of vanity fair
okay face the front ladies and gentlemen
muttering to himself im trying to record the peak of your pathetic lives here
josh stands off to the side lost in his own thoughts
lambert would you like to step in please
josh snaps out of his own head
could you step in so that we can take the photo
just take it without me
we need you in the photo sir
no you dont
just take the damn photo without me okay
the class settles down shocked by the outburst
chastened the photographer turns to the class gripping the camera trigger
i cant believe this is my life
beat to class ready kids
say asshole teacher
the students file out of the gym
josh sits in the bleachers head buried in his hands
i hear things
josh looks up seeing alanso
i spend so much time in the office i hear things
i heard about your son
thank you alanso
times like these
people realize that science doesnt have all the answers
there is a higher force at work
i wish i had your belief
things would be a lot simpler
things are simple
you just cant see it
put your faith in him
he places his gold cross necklace in joshs hand then leaves
josh watches him go then takes out his cell phone
i just found out i have to stay back tonight and finish off mid term grades
it could be a while theres a lot to go through
dont wait up
josh sits on a park bench staring into the distance
he takes out a flask of whisky swigging from it
renai lies in bed staring at the ceiling
renai shuffles in pouring herself a glass of water
then she hears it
a low muttering
it is coming from daltons room
unnerved renai peers through the open door
josh is sitting beside daltons bed reading to him
the men all walked down to the waters edge
and they stood there and asked the beast to come forth
and the beast roared back no
and so they dived in after it
in the sunlight the house looks like a happy place
daltons face is a picture of serenity
a new day shift nurse kelly checks on his feeding tube
renai watches from the doorway
i was going to head off for an hour or so
are you alright here
anything from dalton
her eyes brim with tears
the cracks are showing
keep providing him with stimuli
ive seen it work time and time again
read to him
even if youre doing something else you can play him music that he likes
dont give up
she throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands
i wont i just
i havent slept much the last couple of nights
i feel like the universe is trying to see how far i can bend before i break
the universe picked a fight with the wrong chick
youre a saint
no im not
im doing my job
i chose to be here
you didnt choose any of this
youre the strong one
renai surveys the living room
it is a total mess
water cascades out of a faucet
steam rises from the water
renai lets bath salts fall into the tub
she almost looks relaxed just smelling them
she starts to undress then turns and yelps in fright
a person is standing behind the distorted glass window staring in at her
the shape of the persons head and shoulders can clearly be seen but the glass is too opaque to make out any features
renai slips grabbing the sink
when she glances up the figure is gone
trembling renai opens the window
very very slowly
it is fifteen feet off the ground with a sheer drop below it
renai sits on the front steps alone
it is late
she looks somehow tired and wired at the same time
smoking a cigarette
josh pulls in
fumbles out of his car tipsy
what are you doing up
its midnight josh
when did you start smoking
youve been coming home late every single night
youve never had to do that in all of the years youve been at the school
now all of a sudden you have to stay back late
i dont like it either but im grading tests
what choice do i have
weve gotta pay daltons bills
your mother is paying daltons bills josh
i know because she reminds me every chance she gets
jesus i cant win with you
thats my son in there too not just yours
he paces the anger sobering him
ive always felt like less than good enough for you
i feel it every time you mention our bills
that subtle voice that says cant you get a job that pays more than a teacher
and now i cant even look at you without feeling it
youre projecting that onto me
youve written an entire story about im how im feeling without once asking me how im feeling
i dont need to ask
i know you
i am losing my mind here in this house josh
im scared and i need you and youre not here
where are you
i told you im grading tests
i dont mean that
i mean youre not here
in this situation
youre avoiding it like you do anything stressful whether its this or a parking ticket
christ i should have stayed at the school
there you go again
renai stands up and walks inside the house
the door closes
josh tosses a pillow onto the couch setting himself up for the night
he curls up on it pulling a blanket over himself
the witching hour
save for the omnipresent clock
dalton is as still as weve seen him
a slight facial twitch but we see it
josh snoozes head arched at a bad angle
his back will regret sleeping on this couch
renai tosses and turns restless in sleep
her eyes open and she sucks in a breath
she blinks and looks around the room surprised to be alone sitting up in fright
until she remembers why
she eases back onto the bed
then she looks over at the window
there is a man standing outside it
he is not looking in at her
he is pacing back and forth furiously smoking a cigarette
back and forth back and forth
he has long black greasy hair and a grey jacket
every muscle in renais body freezes
she becomes a glacier
her eyes are drilled to the man unable to move
by sheer will she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door
opens her mouth but no words will come
she glances back at the window
he paces back and forth between the bed and the window just as he was outside ignoring renai
smoking like a fiend
and then suddenly he stops pacing
straight at renai as if just realizing she was there
for a moment their eyes are locked in silence
and then the mans face contorts in anger and he charges towards her arms outstretched growling in fury
renai lets out a shriek of terror that could strip paint
a cry from the depths of her soul
she propels herself backward falling off the bed and scrambling back into the corner
josh charges into the room flicking on the light seeing only renai huddled in the corner screaming
what is it
what is it
renai is incoherent
she cannot stop screaming
josh grabs her by the shoulders
renai what is wrong
the man he was there he tried to there was a man there
foster runs into the room visibly terrified
he sees his mother and instantly begins crying
he runs to his dad holding onto his leg
in the background cali begins crying her screams contributing to an overwhelming din
theres no one here
i saw somebody
theres no one here
dont you dare not believe me
i believe you okay
i just dont know what you want me to do
i want you to tell me that we can leave this house
i will not spend one more night here
i wanna leave i wanna go
i dont want the man to get me
the realization that her child is terrified quiets renai
all is suddenly silent save for the cries of cali in the background
josh holds his son tight
youre okay buddy
ive got you
he and renai exchange a look
i want to leave this house
i cant be here anymore
to move now would be
we would have to rent somewhere
its not please josh
an agreement passes between them
a moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home
movers mill about hauling boxes and couches
renai unpacks boxes
an elderly woman lorraine helps to unpack
this is joshs mother
she has a curt disapproving manner about her that doesnt always make her easy to love
she is actually moving more quickly than renai who groans as if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books
lorraine you shouldnt have to do any of this
im perfectly capable of putting a few things away
i did it for josh his whole life
he never was good with tidying up
i know but i just feel so bad
i think its you who should be sitting down by the looks of it
she boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes
it is a portrait of renai dalton foster and josh
in happier times
lorraine seems taken aback by it
i cant believe you got josh to sit still for a photo
renai reclines against the wall surveying her new living room
her new new house
i cant believe were doing all this again thats what i cant believe
beat looks at her i know you think im crazy
lorraine stops unpacking and fixes renai with a stare
theyve never really gotten along before
adversity has brought about a truce
nobody not me not anybody knows what youre going through right now
whatever you have to do to get through it do it
and never apologize for it
renai hugs her
its a new thing for them and a bit awkward
bryce trimble sits opposite renai and josh
spread out in front of him are a series of x rays labelled dalton lambert
his office is big and expensive
renai looks hopeful
josh looks like a shell of a man
we just wanna say
thank you so much
for helping us out with this doctor
we cant tell you how much it means to have you involved
im glad to help
these recent tests have proven inconclusive
theres absolutely nothing abnormal here
josh and renai deflate
if youre the top of the food chain with this stuff where does that leave us
i dont know
there is a research team in boston who specialize in a new form of treatment
they try to stimulate the patients brain with electric pulses
it has a good success rate with victims of brain injury
we could try that
so theres hope
there are more things we can try
the hope part is up to you
renai sits beside dalton
staring at him
she runs her fingers through his hair touching his skin
a needle touches an lp
the pops and crackles of record hiss spit forth followed by the lilting guitar strums of tip toe through the tulips
the quavering falsetto of tiny tim accompanies the guitar
tip toe by the window by the window that is where ill be
renai walks away and we follow her down the hall into a mess as only a child can make
renai picks up a plate and a fork and knife from the floor
she walks out and we dont cut tracking with her back down the hall towards the kitchen
the records continues warbling in the background
oh tip toe from the garden by the garden of the willow tree
renai passes the living room
what she doesnt see is the child standing in the middle of the room facing the record player
the boy is dressed in clothes from another time but childrens clothes just the same
he is dancing awkwardly shifting his weight from one foot to foot the other sheepishly as if trying it for the first time
renai keeps walking and we stay with her as she moves past the child following her into the mess of the kitchen
she sets the plate down in the sink on top of a stack of other dirty dishes
with a sigh she runs the hot water over the dishes
with a sudden pop the record starts skipping
renai shuts off the water heading back to the living room
she marches in annoyed
her bookshelf is empty
the books that once sat on it are now scattered across the floor
renai scans the books
she pivots her head towards the darkened hallway
there she sees a child hidden in shadow standing in the hall
staring at her
renai doesnt move
and then suddenly the child turns and runs down the hall disappearing into daltons bedroom
oh my god dalton
summoning every ounce of strength renai troops down the hall towards daltons room
renai pushes the door open
dalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney
the only sound is his breathing
renai surveys the room
it is empty
she steps inside glancing over at a cabinet
in the foot high space beneath it a small white shoe protrudes slightly
a childs shoe
heart pounding renai bends down peering into the darkness under the cabinet
the shoe does not have a foot in it
it is simply a discarded shoe
there is no one under the cabinet
the cabinet doors explode open as the child bursts out giggling
only we see that it is not a child
it is a dwarf
a man in childs clothing
the dwarf runs past renai as she leaps back
he runs out of the room giggling
all is quiet again
renai gets up unsure of what to do
numb with terror
suddenly the record pitches back to life the volume startling
renai jolts falling backwards
a darkened class room
an older janitor ned shoulders the door open carrying a mop
he starts when he sees josh sitting at his desk in the pale light of a desk lamp
didnt see you there
sorry to scare you
what are you up to this late
josh holds up his flask of whisky
hes a bit soused
where did all the bartenders who listen to your troubles go ned
ned nods sagely
he sets down his mop and grabs a chair sitting in front of josh with a sigh
he takes the flask
never drink alone
if you take the dirty jokes out of drunkenness all youre left with is the self loathing
he downs a hit from the flask then hands it back
i dont need whisky for that
you people think too much
used to be if life threw a shitstorm at you youd grab the nearest umbrella
your generation would spend a day googling what brand to buy
josh laughs despite himself
i probably would too
beat takes a drink its funny ive always known i was the type of person that things didnt happen to
i made peace with it
i thought to myself its okay ill never win the lottery or climb mount everest
but ill never get a rare tropical blood disease either
it works out
now im the guy whose son is in a mysterious coma
things happen to everybody
even to good people like you
and theyre gonna keep happening the older you get believe me
no use sittin in the dark drinkin over it
be with your wife
tell her your whats on your mind
he takes the flask and has another swig
there sure as hell isnt any umbrellas round here
josh pulls up to the house
turns off the car
an old cadillac is sitting in the driveway
josh clambers out of his car and peers in through the window of the cadillac quizzical
renai is huddled on the couch in the living room gripping her knees to her chest
a man is sitting next to her a handsome soft spoken anglican priest father nathanson
there are subtle changes in his coordination and speech from the booze
this is the first line of a joke
guy comes home to find his wife with a priest
father nathanson stands as does renai
josh this is liam nathanson
a very old friend of mine
nice to meet you
ive heard a lot about you
cant say ive heard the same liam
at least i know youre not sleeping with her
dont be rude josh
josh turns to see his mother holding a tray of tea
what is going on here
i should be going
thank you so much for the tea
he clears his throat and exits quickly and quietly
okay would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here
please sit down joshua
the melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me so just tell me whats wrong
nothing is wrong
we want to talk
nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong
if a doctor calls you into his office and asks you to sit down youre fucked
theres no use lorraine
hes been drinking
i have not been drinking
not enough that we cant talk to each other renai
and dont judge me in that bitchy tone okay
he would never speak to me like that before
youre acting like im some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt
at least im speaking to you
you suddenly have to speak to a priest
or my mother who up until a couple of weeks ago you couldnt stand
youre an asshole
your wife needs you
now sit down and listen to her
i wont ask you again
his mothers tone can still shut him up
go on renai
thing that was in the other house
it followed us
josh shifts in his seat
let her speak
i saw someone again today
in the house
it looked like a young boy
i followed it into daltons room
but it wasnt a child
this thing is here
i know it
you called in a priest to get rid of it
i didnt know what else to do
are you kidding me
was this your idea
it was mine
youve never been to a church in your life
now youre inviting a priest into our home
i feel like i dont even know you right now
this is a fantasy and you need a therapist not a member of the clergy
i told you
whats happening to renai is real
ive seen it for myself
i came here today because last night i had a dream about this place
we are floating through the corridor looking through lorraines pov
we are inside her dream
i was in this house
but it was late at night
the pov keeps moving out of the kitchen and into the hall
i tried to be quiet
i didnt want to wake anybody
i was afraid
the pov floats down the hall reaching a door
the door opens revealing josh and renai sleeping
i looked into your bedroom
you were both asleep
the pov keeps moving down the hall
i knew that i was asleep in the dream
but i could feel that someone was awake in the house
we keep pushing on reaching the door to daltons room
i went into daltons room
the door pushes open
in the dark we can see dalton in bed
there was someone in there with him
the pov turns to see a dark figure standing in the corner
a man was standing in the corner of the room
i asked him who he was
he said he was a visitor
i asked him what he wanted
he said dalton
lorraine is clearly unsettled by the dream
i can still hear that voice
she looks up at josh and screams
over joshs shoulder crouched down behind the couch and peeking up over the armrest at lorraine is a diabolical figure
his face is pure red with smeared lipstick
his scalp is completely bald yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears
other than his face his skin is charcoal black
lorraine recoils back utterly petrified
what is it
lorraine stares eerily into his eyes
renai looks to josh who is at a total loss
she is crying
his anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms
i dont know how
i know somebody who can help
if youre willing to ask for it
a battered van is parked in the driveway of the house
renai and josh stand in front of two men
they are silent
the shorter one is a wiry young man who looks like he spends most of his time in dark rooms
not a member of the beach volleyball team
this is specs
the other is tucker a larger man with scruffy facial hair
he is eating a hot pocket
so you must be josh
that wasnt psychic
lorraine told me your name
beat spooky voice im here to solve your problem
im just kidding with the voice
we take this very seriously
so is elise coming or
she wont be joining us yet
usually we handle all the background stuff then she gets involved when we have the facts
helps weed out the nutjobs
this is a little uncomfortable
speaking for myself
im not used to this kind of stuff
we understand completely
ninety six per cent of the people we deal with have had no experience with this type of phenomena before
he takes out a notepad and pen
i would like to start by interviewing you both
can we record your answers
my assistant will check different areas of the house for electrical anomalies
ill get him started
tucker would you follow me
specs leads tucker into the kitchen
could you not eat that in front of the clients
finish it in here
this industry gets laughed at enough as it is
specs is halfway through interviewing josh and renai
do you or any of your children suffer from epilepsy or autism
i mean our son
i heard about this from lorraine
he is in a coma the cause of which is unknown
do either of you habitually use drugs or alcohol
no drugs at all
i take anti depressants sometimes
do you have a history of clinical depression
not a history
ive had bouts of it
in the past
renai is uncomfortable
specs makes a note
the camera beeps
tucker could you check the camera
im still assisting in the other room
whenever youre ready then
a long beat
tucker finally enters adjusts the camera
to renai and josh he handles administration i handle technical
its an even split
he couldnt change a light bulb and im no good with paperwork
it bores me senseless
specs clears his throat peeved
do you have any history of sexual abuse in the family
im sorry i have to ask how this relates to our problem
nine times out of ten when someone comes to us with a problem like this its because of an inward cause within the family unit
not a physical force outside of it
specs and tucker mill around the room
tucker is carrying a small electronic device
he holds it against the wall
what is that
tri field meter
it measures dc fields and the natural electro magnetic environment
sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere
it can cause hallucinations changes in energy
its a little more complicated than that but you know you get the general idea
its basically that
not really but whatever
the tech stuffs not relevant to you anyway
its very relevant but its all good
tucker edges into the corridor
he switches out the light then takes what looks like a modified view master toy out of his shoulder bag holding it up to his eyes
he stalks down the corridor with it
all is quiet
tuckers pov through viewmaster different filters highlight different degrees of uv light
each slide changes the readings
he approaches the grandfather clock
another slide clicks into place showing us two figures
standing beside the clock
in the negative light they look like females
tucker lowers the device
there is no one there
specs packs up the video equipment babbling to josh and renai
epilepsy in one of the children mostly
its very common
if we approach things academically it lets us find the genuinely interesting cases
tucker backs into the room
he is afraid
i think we can call elise now
josh opens the door to see an elderly woman elise rainier who despite her years maintains a sprightly energy
there is absolutely nothing morbid or dour about her
no my mother couldnt come its just me
you must be lorraines son
youve grown since i last saw you
last saw me
your mother and i have been friends for a long time
elise steps inside
renai tucker and specs gather around her
everyone becomes very subservient like the queen just arrived
re specs and tucker theyre very good assistants but i cant get them to dress any better
pleased to meet you
elise takes her hat off and scans the room taking a deep breath
tucker jabbers eager to please
we took tri field and emf readings of the whole house
all the wiring alarm clocks radios toasters tv record player fuse box
nothing went off the charts
and the previous home
tucker and specs look at each other
tucker hadnt monitored that yet
i could jump on that this afternoon if you like
make up for lost time
yeah but who would work the equipment
ill need to be there
you know what dont even sweat it
ill make myself available
no thats fine gentlemen
she stares up at the ceiling as if seeing something they cant
i dont think bad wiring is the problem here
she drifts over to the bookshelf her hand landing on the stack of photo albums renai looked through in the opening scene
renai and josh exchange a look
may i walk through the house
steven do you have your sketchbook
specs hurriedly fishes a sketchbook and pencil out of his bag
yes i do
yes i do
were going to need it
what is it for
she tells me what she sees and i draw it
its the most important part of her process
his drawings and my photos comprise her visual records
especially the drawings
its not debatable
it is but whatever
onwards and upwards
find me a ghost
elise begins walking through the house
tucker and specs trail her and we follow them into the hallway
renai and josh stay back sheepish
elise stalks forward at the front surveying every nook and cranny of the house
elise stops suddenly
she is staring straight at a corner of the hallway next to the grandfather clock
what is it
there is something here
this is where i saw it
elise calmly mutters something to specs in a low voice but we have trouble hearing it only snatches of key words
her eyes are
he immediately starts sketching
his line drawings are fast but detailed
he outlines the wall the ceiling lamp the grandfather clock
and then something else
two young women
standing next to the grandfather clock dressed in amish garb
even in the roughness of the drawing we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin
tucker takes out a camera snaps some shots
josh and renai step forward seeing the sketch
elise keeps moving heading straight for one door in particular
she stops running her hand over the wood
do i have permission to enter this room
maybe you could wait back there
josh and renai hug each other
tucker lowers the camera
elise grips the door handle and turns it
the door groans open
dalton is lying on his gurney surrounded by the sluggish drone of hospital equipment
the curtains are drawn and the room is dark
then steps inside
leave the lights off
elise steps closer to dalton
she runs her hands over his prone body
she shivers as she does
a ripple of fear passes through her
her breath quickens
very very slowly
she gazes up at a corner of the ceiling
her eyes widen and the look on her face her arm raises up her finger extending and pointing at the corner she is glaring at
what is it
what do you see
elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to specs keeping her eyes glued to the far corner of the ceiling
we cannot hear what she is whispering
hand shaking specs feverishly starts to sketch
we cannot see what he is drawing
what do you see
the strokes of specs pencil become faster and rougher keeping up with elises whispers
sweat dots his forehead
tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively
he holds up his viewmaster
pov through viewmaster we see the far corner of the ceiling change color as tucker rotates the lenses inside
but nothing out of the ordinary appears
just a ceiling
suddenly renai charges forward snatching the sketch book
the drawing is of a hideous form crouched in the corner of the ceiling staring down at dalton below
it is the red faced demon lorraine saw earlier
his naked body is charcoal black
whilst also strangely translucent the veins visible underneath the flesh
a corpulent stomach juts out as if he were pregnant
terrified renai flicks on the light revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling
elise holds court in the living room
renai and josh hold each other struggling to comprehend it all
im not sure if you are ready to hear this yet
but unfortunately i cant waste any time easing you into it
there is no time left
she takes a deep breath preparing herself
i want you to know that this is what i believe and it may contradict a previous medical diagnosis
however you called me here and i am taking that as an acceptance of my readings
is not in a coma
his physical body is here but his spiritual body is not
the reason these disturbances followed you to a new home is because
it is not the house that is haunted
it is your son
this is too much for josh
renai however wants to listen
i dont understand
elise considers what she is about to say carefully
have you ever heard of astral projection
out of body experiences
i call them travellers
these are people with the ability to leave their physical body and travel to different places in an astral form
to some degree we all have the ability to do it
but most of us subconsciously suppress it or dont know how to access it
josh shakes his head agitated
renai leans forward desperate for an answer to her terror
a very accomplished astral projector
he has been since he was very young
hes not afraid of his ability
and that lack of fear has led him to travel too far and become lost
elise gazes up at the ceiling as if looking into another world
in the further
what do you mean
the further is that place beyond our perception beyond our understanding of the physical world that we can see and touch
it is a place without clocks or measurements without past or future
an infinite realm that holds all of our dreams
and all of our nightmares
she turns to look at them
that is where dalton is
renai cries unprepared for what she is hearing
the problem is that with his astral body gone he has left a physical body with us
an empty vessel
josh cant meet her gaze
and there are entities that know this
they can smell it the chance to live again
that is why they have gathered around him
how many are there
there are five benevolent spirits
five different entities for whom dalton has become a most prized possession
they are trying to get inside his physical body
and they get closer with each passing day
her words hang in the air like gunsmoke
pure fear courses through joshs eyes
he fidgets agitated
then there are two entities who are
one of them takes the form of a man the other
she holds up the drawing that specs di
they work together so desperate are they to possess dalton
they are the closest of all the entities to getting inside him
i dont want to scare you but i have never in all my years of doing this experienced anything as terrifying as their presence
is there a way to bring dalton back
there is something we could try
a way of calling him back
i would need your complete trust
josh cant take it any more
he stands up
this has gone too far
you said that youd give her a chance
i have given her a chance and i did that because i wanted to help you
but i cannot have somebody telling us that the reason our son is in a coma is because his soul is floating off somewhere in another dimension
i know this is hard to hear
no its not fair is what it is
youre preying on peoples grief and vulnerability which is really easy to do in a situation like this
why did we go to all the trouble of bringing them here if youre just going to reject what they say
because i wanted to help you
to put your mind at ease and if this helped then great
but to drag dalton into this
josh youre not being fair
how did the voice of reason become the bad guy here
dont you see
you want to believe
of course you do honey anybody would
the room goes quiet
josh turns to elise
look i appreciate what youre trying to do
i really do
but i think its dangerous to start throwing out false hope like this
i have to put my foot down
my wife is not
mentally well at the moment and i have to keep at least one of her feet here in the real world
you never believed me
honey im on your side
but i genuinely think this is dangerous and frankly a little exploitative
he turns to elise specs and tucker
you come into a home with a seriously ill child you make a tenuous connection between him and these experiences renai is having and viola the client starts crying because
theyre desperate to believe the tears validate your power thank you thatll be six hundred dollars please
we reject more cases than we take
were not out for money sir
i know i know
look i appreciate your interest and your time
thank you very much
he goes to the front door opening it
i completely understand
and i honestly dont blame you for reacting like this
she walks to the door followed by specs and tucker who sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly
thank you for your time
the door closes
they are gone
renai lies in bed awake
a broken shell of her former self
a bottle of anti depressants sits on the bedside table
josh enters the bedroom
sits down beside her
look at me for a second honey
look at me
she doesnt look up
did you really believe what she said
in your heart of hearts did you actually take what she was saying literally
a long beat of silence passes
i dont know
do you think i dont want to believe in that stuff
of course i do
it would make life a lot easier if i did
if i believed that some supernatural force was responsible for whats happened to our son
i dont believe anything anymore josh
i used to
i used to believe that i could keep my children safe
i used to believe everything would be okay
to believe in something you have to know it to be true
she turns and looks at him
the things that have happened to me havent confirmed any beliefs theyve done the opposite
theyve made me question what i believe
theyve made me realize that maybe we dont know as much as we think we do
josh paces at his wits end
you ask me if i believe what she said to be true and the answer is i dont know
but let me ask you this in your heart of hearts can you say for certain that it isnt
josh lies beside renai who is sleeping
he is wide awake staring at the ceiling
he gets out of bed
the door opens
all is mute as josh enters skulking carefully through the darkness
the curtains lull in the slightest of breezes
josh stands over dalton
he stares down at his sons body then lets his gaze drift around the room
past the closet past the drawings pinned to the wall and the toybox
all the way to the corner of the ceiling that elise was so frightened of
joshs eyes drill into the shadows
is there something waiting there
finally josh sits down beside dalton
he grips his sons hand
where are you
where did you go
can you hear me
im begging you to show me that you can hear me
i dont know how to help you
please tell me what to do
joshs torment fills the air
but dalton doesnt move
please god please help me
give me my son back
i will do anything just to have him back
josh studies daltons face for a response
not a twitch
he collapses forward onto dalton
holding him tight
i need him back
i need him to show me that he can hear me
for a moment all we can hear is joshs breathing
something josh doesnt see
daltons face twitches
it is a very slight movement
this movement is followed by something that is hard to miss one of the tacks pinning one of daltons drawings to the wall begins to wind loose
it pops free shooting across the room like a kernel of popcorn
followed by another tack
the second tack lands in joshs lap
puzzled he picks it up examining it
he looks up his eye drawn to the picture on the wall
with total astonishment he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free popping out of the wall
the drawing floats down to the ground
josh stoops down picking it up
it is a drawing split into two halves
the left half is a self portrait of dalton lying in bed looking down from above
the right half is a depiction of outer space squiggly stars and bloated planets
dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side flying above the house with another man
at the bottom of the first drawing dalton has written last night i watched myself sleep
a tear falls down joshs face
he begins to cry
deep and painful tears he has long pent up
beneath the second drawing dalton has written then i flew away
renais eyes flutter open
she glances over
no one is there
renai shuffles into the kitchen
josh is sitting at the kitchen table staring at daltons drawing
he hasnt slept and looks it
he looks up at her
renai approaches josh and they hug
holding on for dear life
the lambert house is lit from within
like a jack o lantern
tucker sets up two stills cameras around daltons room zipping back and forth between the two tripods
specs opens up a kit taking out his notepad and a pencil
a small circular table has been set up adjacent to daltons bed
elise sits at the table flanked on either side by josh and renai
whats most important is that you realize no two attempts are the same
i will be completely honest with you about the results and if no dialogue is established i will tell you
i am not in the business of embellishing success
what happens happens
josh and renai nod grimly truly out of their depth
forget the limits and laws and logic of this world
we are treading in a different place now
tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner holding up a hand held video camera
these still cameras are rigged to pick up changes in the atmosphere electrical or temperature wise
dont be alarmed if they go off
everything i say while i am in tune will be at a very low volume so you wont hear any of it
steven will write it down and repeat it for you
specs waits obediently at her side
hold on to each other and stay focused
youll see things you dont understand
do not question them or speak in any way
she turns to specs
dim the lights please
tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level
elise closes her eyes concentrating
she relaxes her head as if meditating letting it loll on her shoulders
one of the cameras on the tripod goes off bathing the room in white light for a split second
elise inhales and exhales deeply slipping away
soon she is very still
specs nods to tucker silently then produces an odd looking device made from grey cloth
it almost resembles a gas mask from world war with a cone shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose
the snout of the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk coiling outwards and ending in an old listening device like an early version of a microphone
specs slips two hooks over elises ears and gently places the device over her nose and mouth
he then takes a seat next to her behind renai who holds elises hand
specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus around his neck that holds a flashlight in place
he flicks it on then holds the microphone end of elises facemask up to his ear a pencil gripped in the other hand
dead silence descends over the group like a blanket
then we hear something lilt through the old microphone
it is elises muttered whispers
specs begins writing
renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in cursive
we are calling out to you dalton renai grips joshs hand tightly
we are calling out to you dalton
tell us that you are safe tell us where you are tell us that you are safe
tell us where you are
for what seems like an eternity all is quiet and still
until elises eyelids flutter
another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone at specs ear
it is your mother and father we have been looking for you it is your mother and father
we have been looking for you
specs writes again more intense this time
i need help i cant see in here i need help
i cant see in here
follow my voice dalton come back to us follow my voice dalton
come back to us
another long pause
a little too long
why arent you talking anymore dalton
why arent you talking anymore dalton
a long beat
tuckers camera flash goes off again
if they hear me theyll hurt me if they hear me theyll hurt me
who will hurt you
who will hurt you
the man with fire on his face the man with fire on his face
can you find your way back to us
can you find your way back to us
there is no way out there is no way out
follow my voice dalton follow my voice dalton
be quiet theyll hear you
be quiet theyll hear you
they wont hear you just follow my voice they wont hear you just follow my voice
they are coming they heard you help me helpme mom and dad please save me please come and get mepleasecomeandgetmecome elises head twitches as specs writes furiously trying to keep
his pencil finally snaps
he snatches up another
dalton are you there
an agonizing ocean of silence
then this furious scrawl listen to me you filthy whore he isnt here you should not have come here you fucking bitch i will rip your cunt apart and eat
the fucking innards that spill forth from it i specs writing begins to shred the paper as he writes furiously the scrawl getting out of control
sweat flies from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down
suddenly a piercing scream blasts through the microphone and he jerks it away from his ear then looks over at elise
with utter dread he sees that she is no longer wearing the mask
she has taken it off and is panting heavily
the scream continues through the mic audible to everyone
then peters out
shocked silence follows
josh glances over at daltons bed
he is not in it
stunned josh turns back to the table his heart leaps out of his skin and so does renais as they both turn towards dalton
dalton stares at them
not a trace of emotion on his face
then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands wrenching it downwards with almighty force and breaking his renai screams into the abyss as dalton bellows at
them spit flying from his throat his tongue hanging down over his dislocated jaw
he stamps his foot and the table and everyone sitting at it renai josh and elise go flying backwards as if pushed by a hurricane smashing into the wall with
we realize that dalton was not sitting at the table but squatting down awkwardly
he stands up then steps forward
as josh and renai watch his knee begins to bend backwards the tendons stretching and snapping the knee bending in the opposite direction
his other knee follows and he steps forward both knees bending back
specs is rigid in his chair rooted to the spot notepad still in hand
when he looks up at dalton the flashlight under his chin shines in daltons eyes
dalton roars and advances forward slapping specs with the force of ten men
specs reels backwards hitting the wall smashing his head and crumpling like paper
elise stands to face dalton
the camera flash goes off again lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing elise the lipstick smeared face of a demon instead of daltons face
tucker shrinks back as he captures all this with the video camera
dalton steps forward again and elise charges at him grabbing dalton by the hair
leave this vessel
leave this vessel
dalton bellows again a howl so course and ungodly that it seems ripped straight from the bowels of lucifer himself
dalton flies backwards hitting the corner of the wall and then climbing it arcing his body into the far corner of the ceiling like an expert contortionist
he hisses at them as the camera flash fires again and again showing them split second frames of the red faced creature
leave this earthly body
dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks elise down
the room begins to shake
the closet doors burst open
with terror elise looks over and sees several figures peering out from within the closet
two are the women that specs drew
another is a small man dressed like a child
they stare out at elise their eyes glinting in the dark
elise turns to see josh
the camera flash strobes repeatedly and gives us split second glimpses of an old woman dressed in victorian era garb standing directly behind josh
and then with absolute fear renai sees the long haired man standing over her
he screams at her and pushes her against the wall licking her
she cries out terrified
with the spirit world crashing in around her elise pulls herself off the floor and yells again
leave his body
dalton suddenly spasms dropping out of the corner and hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge
terrified specs scrambles over to the corner flicking the light switch
the room is instantly flooded with light
the room has stopped shaking
the screaming has stopped
renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches daltons limp body
she listens for breathing
his chest moves
he is still breathing
she holds him and cries
more desperate than ever
tucker specs and elise convene in the kitchen slumped amongst the boxes for the tech gear
all are in shock
i feel like a mountain climber whos been waiting his whole life to climb everest and now that im standing on the summit i dont know what to do with
ill tell you what we do with ourselves
we make a short list of our preferred media outlets thats what
he holds up his video camera
he hits play on a monitor that his video camera is cabled to
chaotic images of dalton from the previous scene spit to life
behind dalton we can just make out the blurry image of the red faced demon
puppeteering dalton from behind
controlling his limbs like a human marionette
oh my god
after all the years weve been dining out on morsels like a faucet that turns itself on and off
we finally have some empirical evidence of the real thing
he hits pause on the video freeze framing the hellish image
proof of what
nine tenths of the world believes that when you die your soul ascends to sit with god
would you be telling them something they didnt already know
that is so not the point
this is not about religion
here we have irrefutable evidence of a paranormal experience
our job is to share it
no our job is not to alert the press and prove the existence of the paranormal as you call it
im not out to prove anything
ive known there was a higher plane ever since i was a little girl and i could play hopscotch with people whose names were inscribed on tombstones
what you call paranormal is a fact of life for me
our job is to help people
the least we can do is spare them the indignity of sixty minutes
she snatches his camera away from him and stands up
yeah until they get their book deal
then youll wish youd listened
no i wont tucker
ill just be proud of you
you two stared down something that would crush most mortals tonight and you stood tall
they manage a smile
so what do we do now
we answer the door
what do you mean
there is a knock at the front door
josh sits with renais head in his lap
she is too traumatized to speak
rain dribbles down the window pane
josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door
elise shuffles over to answer it
she opens the door to reveal lorraine wet from the downpour
elise steps aside and lorraine walks in gravely sedate
what are you doing here
i asked your mother to come over
i called her immediately after
i told her to hurry over
lorraines usual strong will has evaporated
she looks to elise
there is something we must talk about
sit down lorraine
lorraine follows orders easing onto the sofa
thunder growls in the distance
tell me what
lorraine swallows and starts talking
i knew to call elise in this situation
the reason i know her so well
is because i called her myself once
she looks up at josh
to help you josh
what are you talking about
lorraine cant go on
elise steps in
its no accident that your son is such a gifted traveller
the ability was handed down to him
by his father
we have returned to the opening scene
we are looking down on a sleeping child
chest rising and falling with each breath
this is josh as a child
we move away from him exploring the dark room
tucker and specs enter the room lingering at the back
done that before
when you were about eight
you suffered night terrors
awful fits of pure fear
you were terrified of an old woman who you said would come to visit you at night
again we return to the opening scene
floating down a long hallway
a window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach
someone is standing in front of it
the murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away
we follow it tentative
turning a corner we see the figure
standing in a doorway
now we can make out the edges of the figure
it is an old woman
hair in a victorian bun
a corseted dress
let me in
lorraine closes her eyes struggling to go on
i dismissed your stories
told you to grow up
then i saw her for myself
she looks to elise who nods
hand trembling lorraine retrieves a packet from within her coat
the paper is yellowing
soaked from the rain
lorraine hands the packet to josh who is dumbfounded
renai peers over joshs shoulder at a polaroid of a boy about nine years old sitting on a couch
early s period
it is a young josh
behind him is the blurred outline of a josh runs his finger over the shadow
his heart rate speeds up
an old memory is coming back to him
at first i thought it was a camera problem
then i saw her again
josh flips to the next photo it is another faded frame of josh as a youngster
this time he stands in an old kitchen
once again there is a figure behind him clearer this time but still hidden in silhouette
a step closer to josh
josh flips to the next picture
a black and white shot of himself as a young boy lying in bed
with dread josh sees the unmistakable features of an old woman crouching beside his bed
staring at him
in each photo she got closer and closer to you
josh flips to the next picture in this one young josh is standing by a car
behind him the details of the old womans dress are visible
her arm is extended
reaching out for joshs neck
renais hand flies to her mouth
finally i was so scared i called elise
sweat pours down joshs brow
he lets the photographs flutter from his fingers backing away
fragments of memories rock his entire body
i dont remember any of this
youve blocked it out
but in the back of your mind youre still afraid of having your picture taken arent you
josh grabs the wall weak at the knees
ive kept the photos hidden ever since then
i advised lorraine to hide them
to stop taking your picture
and to let you forget
who is she
she befriended your astral body then drew you out into the further just as dalton has been drawn out
but she deceived you
all she wanted was an empty vessel
a physical body
im sorry josh
i didnt want to make you remember this
i only do it for the sake of your son
a quiet descends over them
your son is out there
and you are the only one who can bring him back
josh looks up at her
how long do we have before
takes him over completely
all eyes are on elise
if you cannot reach him tonight then he is gone forever
the lights have been dimmed
josh sits on a single person lounge chair
elise sits opposite him
tucker and specs set up around her fixing their cameras in place
renai leans forward on the couch opposite chewing her nails to the quick
lorraine is next to her
remember who you are and why you are traveling
keep one foot in this world
are you ready
renai hugs him and they hold onto it
she whispers to him staring into his eyes
i want you to know something
you have never been less than good enough for me
youve always been perfect for me
youre my best friend
i love you so much
i love you too
i have since the first time you looked at me
i dont exist without you
elise drifts over to the piano lifting the metronome from it
she sets it down in front of josh freeing the weighted swing arm so it moves back and forth
close your eyes josh
let all life around you fade out into the background
until the only thing you can hear is the ticking of the metronome
we push in on josh inhaling and exhaling
focus on a spot in the center of your forehead
feel that spot getting further away as you drift off to sleep
we are now in an ecu of josh
i want you to relax your physical body and let the astral body gain strength
feel it rising out of your chest
renai watches literally and figuratively on the edge of her seat
tucker and specs take notes from the corner
josh breathes deeply
eyes shut tightly
joshs eyes open suddenly and he stands up frustrated marching across the living room
this is useless
i have no idea what im doing and you just suddenly expect me to
he turns around and stops dead
his words trail off
he sees his own body sitting in the armchair eyes closed
elise is sitting opposite with her back to the josh who is now standing
the living room is exactly as it was only renai lorraine tucker and specs have disappeared
they are nowhere to be seen
stunned into mute shock josh stares at his own body in the armchair
slowly elise turns her head away from the josh in the chair staring eerily into the standing joshs eyes
she can see him
now you are free
keep your guide and a steady stride
and into the further you go
she turns back to the josh in the chair
the room seems to have darkened even more somehow
josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it yawns outwards eventually swallowed by complete blackness
he is not in another world
he is in his own house
note the following scenes are not going to be movie quiet
they will be inhumanly quiet
there will no score
only sound scape
this is another world and should feel so
josh moves forward gliding down the hall slowly
he looks down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the ground
he is floating
he moves into the darkness of the hall
past the bedroom doors and closet doors
as he floats past he scans every darkened corner for the slightest trace of movement
he reaches the front door
he moves towards it and as he does it opens
his street beckons beyond the door
josh floats across his lawn
there are no people or cars on the street
it is as desolate as a post apocalyptic wasteland
some lights flicker from within the houses but no movement or signs of human forms
josh floats an inch above the road moving down the street
one thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon or city scape here
joshs immediate surroundings are visible for about one hundred yards or so
anything beyond that in any direction fades into blackness
as if someone were shining a giant spotlight down on him
renai watches josh
he is completely still
in a trance
his eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions underneath
josh keeps moving his fear registering even in this world
he looks down at his feet
he is frustrated that he cant move any faster
he concentrates with fierce intensity and then watches as his feet touch the ground
he is walking
he starts to move faster gaining control of his movement
the sound of his voice is strangely dead as if he were inside a soundproof recording studio
there are no walls or angles for it to bounce off
where are you
for a long time there is nothing
then he sees it
shrouded in shadow
standing on the street corner with his back to josh
josh moves towards the figure
the man abruptly turns the corner without looking back
josh glances around the corner
there is nobody there
he continues down the street
he sees a little girl
far in the distance but close enough to focus on
she stands and stares
then turns and walks away
like an apparition
he looks to his right and sees behind a curtain in one of the windows back lit by candle light
as with the others the shadow turns away and disappears
josh walks towards the front door of the house
he reaches it and turns the handle
a long corridor beckons
as with all of this world it is dark here
josh walks into the corridor looking to his left and right into empty rooms
living rooms and bedrooms
devoid of life
the colors are muted
the palate drained
only reds and blacks pop out
blood and darkness
josh keeps moving down the corridor
up ahead he sees a figure run past the top of the hall ignoring josh
he presses forward following the figure
he glances into an empty kitchen
food rots on the table
his footsteps have no sound as he continues on
he passes a door that is partly open
he pushes it wide open
the room is small and empty
a strange room
like a stage
a figure is sitting in the corner facing the wall like a child being punished at school
josh steps closer cautious
takes another step
where is dalton
he steps closer yet again
his hand reaches out to touch the figures back
his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder
soft laughter behind him
josh glances back to look for the source
when he turns back the figure is gone
he wheels around seeing the small statured figure of the dwarf that renai encountered stepping through the door of the room
josh sidles back into the corridor
his pace is sluggish dream like
frustrated he stops
then turns to his left
the man is not looking at him
only standing very close
his neck lolls on his shoulders
around and around
he seems stuck on a loop
he is dressed in a fifties era suit
do you know where dalton is
the man doesnt acknowledge him
why do i have to put up with you
what a tramp
you call this a home
i work all day for this
he marches away leaving josh standing alone
josh keeps going whirling around
he reaches a set of stairs
the stairs descend into darkness
josh squints into the dark afraid
where are you
the low rumble of this place is the only reply
josh turns to walk away
a distant voice stops him
josh snaps back
the voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of the stairs
josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it
the core of a rotten apple
the bowels of hell
drenched in shadow josh fumbles forward into yet another corridor of this labyrinth
he realizes he knows where he is
he is in his old house
an alternate world version of it
the lighting is different its darker
there are no signs of life
water drips somewhere
josh stumbles forward seeing an open door
josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room
there are three people in here a middle aged woman a middle aged man and a young girl
they are all frozen standing in place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life
the woman is in the middle of ironing
the man is sitting in an arm chair reading a newspaper
the girl is lying on the floor
the whole scene looks like a macabre leave it to beaver tableau a cheerful family frozen in time
josh steps closer to the mother
hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her blink
her body moves slightly
she is not frozen merely playing statues
like a street performer keeping as still as possible
josh turns to the father
he is the same
his hand shakes struggling to hold the newspaper in place
he backs away from them truly creeped out
his back hits a window and he turns peering through the glass down at the street below
a figure hidden in silhouette is gazing up at him
josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room
a weathered door is adjacent to the kitchen
the door is ajar
through it josh can see somebodies leg
josh approaches the door prodding it open gently with his finger
it is a bedroom
a tattered cot sits against the wall
a young man sits on the cot holding a rifle
like the others he is trying to be completely still as if on pause
he is having more trouble than the family trembling slightly
im looking for my son dalton
the boy does not look up
does not move
josh retreats scanning the kitchen
there are soiled pots in the sink
rotting food but no bugs
josh turns the faucet but no water comes forth
when he turns back the young man is gone
no longer in his bedroom
josh glances back at the living room
the young man is now standing inside the living room
again he is frozen
holding his rifle
looking down at his family who are now splayed out on the carpet soaked in each of them has a bullet hole in their head
repulsed josh tip toes past them
he looks down at the mother a bullet wound in the center of her chest
still playing dead
more corridors disappearing into darkness
josh wrenches his hair in frustration
he boils over screaming at the top of his lungs
his cry recedes into nothingness
he heard that
excited he spins around trying to determine where it came from
as he does he sees that the entire dead family is now gathered at the door to the living room
he summons all his strength and starts running backing away from them
he drives himself to move faster and faster
a figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway
it is the long haired man in the grey jacket
the man who terrorized renai
i hear you
i hear you but you dont know what youve done
he licks his lips
there is a place that you cant go to and this is that place
he is only a few yards from josh now
he screams with awesome power his spit flying
he charges at josh screaming with hellfire fury
josh recoils falling onto the floor screaming
joshs body jolts in the chair and he makes a noise somewhere between a scream and a moan
whats happening to him
elise leans in attempting to communicate with josh
youre stronger then they are josh
you are a living soul
the long haired man attacks him viciously
then something changes in josh he gets angry
he shoves the long haired man back pounding into him with the strength of ten men
get away from me
frightened the long haired man retreats backing away until he is swallowed up by the blackness
josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this escher like maze of passageways
from darkness into baroque extravagance
josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected opulence
as if a palace had been stormed the occupants murdered and the place left to rot
mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes the rest having rotted way
mirrors line the walls their surface too clouded to see into
he weaves between pillars finally coming across a figure slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog
it is dalton
josh runs to him
his foot is chained to a pipe behind him the clamp binding his right ankle
he looks pale and sick
he looks like one of them
im taking you back
he sees that dalton is terrified
looking over joshs shoulder
what is it
he glances back spotting an open door at the end of the ballroom light spilling from within it
there is somebody inside
a grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold rimmed mirror at a baroque powder table
it is the red faced creature seen by elise
the creature daubs red lipstick onto its face arching forward glaring into the mirror caking the make up on
the room is littered with hundreds of discarded childrens toys teddy bears stuffed animals dolls including one white faced black haired doll we recognize
they are scattered about like bones collecting dust in the shadows
suddenly the creature stops what it is doing
it sees something in the mirror
what it sees is josh
with horror josh watches as the red faced man stands up and staggers to the door peering through the crack at him
josh wrestles to free daltons leg from the chain
behind them the red faced man opens the door
a rage unknown to humans is building up inside the creature
help me dad
take this off me
the creature steps closer
taking his time
drool seeping from his mouth with each drunken wayward lope
youre not really here
youre asleep in your bed in our home
just stand up
hes going to hurt me again
this isnt real
you can do this
just stand up
dalton does and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer attached to his foot
the red faced man roars and the power of his breath sends them flying back
josh smashes his head on a pillar blood leaking from his head
the power of this demon far outweighs the others
josh scrambles to his feet and snatches up dalton carrying him to the door as the red faced man pursues
josh convulses in the chair choking
josh surges down a corridor carrying dalton
the red faced man hobbles up behind them his rasping wheeze growing in volume
youre here now
josh stampedes through the front door of the house but instead of the street he is facing another corridor
they spill into the second corridor running again racing past rows and rows of doors
josh twitches in his chair sweat beading on his forehead
elise paces in front of him
theyve made contact
i know it
hes found your son
what happens now
we need them to come back
we need him to find us
tuckers equipment begins to shake on the table
the hanging light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling it
a force is building in the room
as josh and dalton streak down the corridor each door opens and a different figure staggers out
the solemn dead
pale skin hollow eyes
their dead eyes drill into joshs soul
they want what he has life
they begin running chasing josh
dozens of them
josh stops seeing that the corridor seemingly has no end
he yells in frustration
i want to get out
joshs body shudders the cry escaping his lips
the room trembles again
elise looks to renai
call out to him
josh whips around desperate
josh follows the order and hears it
a faint shout
a siren call from another world
josh follow my voice
the voice seems to come from behind the door in front of josh
he shoves it open renai glares at joshs eyelids
as if he can see her through them
follow my voice
come back to us
the room stops trembling
all is very still
for a moment it is as if time has stopped
a drawer slides open in the corner of the room
lorraine and renai gasp at this supernatural interruption
specs clambers to his feet approaching the drawer
it contains a note pad and nothing else
he reaches out to close it
and then jolts as a hand reaches out from within it
he flails backwards in fright watching as the hand wrenches a mop of hair into view
a full grown body begins to claw its way out of the drawer
drawers in daltons room slide open in unison
the closet bursts open
pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the different doors undulating out of impossibly small spaces and falling onto the floor like limbless insects
cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are slithering through the fissures
more doors shoot open cabinets closets the pantry
forced by unseen hands
more hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world
josh is exhausted pushing himself to the limits
he hears the voice again distant and small
josh follows the voice to a door
he staggers towards it still supporting dalton
he slams the door open falling through it into the empty basement
he is in the basement of his old house
the wooden steps beckon above him
renais voice cries out from behind the door at the top of the stairs
come back to us
put me down i can run
josh sets dalton down who scampers up the stairs
josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face
she leers at josh through the window of the basement her visage spookily flecked in candlelight
josh is transfixed
come on dad
im right behind you
dalton charges ahead as josh glares back at this face from his past
what do you want from me
the old womans eerily unblinking gaze cuts through josh
a long dormant rage boils over inside him
he approaches the window vomiting fury at her
get the fuck away from me
im not scared of you just leave me alone
get away from me
the old womans lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of molars
a smile to buckle the steeliest nerve
she raises a lit candle to her lips
she snuffs out the plume with a single puff
plunging the basement into darkness
specs staggers back as the skeletal figures emerging from the cabinets ambulate into the living room surrounding josh
check on the boy
specs sprints out of the room
we are now locked into a pov shot pushing down the corridor of the lamberts new house
the scene of the trance
our pov is bee lining for daltons bedroom
in another pov shot we surge up the basement stairs
our pov is only a few yards from daltons bedroom door
the red faced man appears at the opposite end of the hall
he screams and flits towards us
the pov keeps going hitting the bedroom door and flinging it open seeing daltons body sleeping inside
we soar towards it getting closer specs stands over daltons body
suddenly dalton shudders his legs spasm
his eyes flick open and he sucks in a huge breath
dalton sits up panting
renai charges into the room
he looks at her registering her appearance
renai literally throws herself at him wrapping her arms around his body
no words can express
renai scoops him up carrying him out of the bedroom
the second pov whooshes down the corridor zeroing in on the living room
a scene of desperation
elise leans into joshs face
the living room is now filled with the creeping forms of the souls who crawled out from within the drawers
all of them marching towards josh
find me josh
the closest entity reaches out with gnarled fingers and is almost touching josh the pov shoots towards joshs body seconds away joshs eyes burst open and he inhales a chest
full of air as if emerging from deep water
he falls forward his strength gone
he pants on the floor barely able to speak
dalton and renai pounce on him
josh holds onto dalton like hes a life preserver and in a way for josh he is
he laughs inhaling deeply
specs elise and tucker approach
renai sees them and stands up tearful
she is lost for words
i dont know what to say
she rushes forward and hugs all three of them
josh brings lorraine in they all embrace in a circle
a group hug for the ages
now this is worth dying for
specs and tucker haul a large tripod case to their van heaving it into the back
they stand in awkward silence
its been a long day
i guess you did some pretty awesome stuff in there
you deserve some credit
you did good too in an assistant type way
tucker cant hold his stoic pose any longer
he breaks out laughing followed quickly by specs
they shake hands
dude i got some amazing shots
we are gonna write a book and my shots are gonna be the main selling point
not the main selling point but definitely important for sure
renai lie with dalton on her bed
im never letting you go to sleep again
she runs her fingers through his hair
did you know wed come and find you
whenever youre lost
well always come and find you
josh wanders out of the kitchen examining the house as if seeing it for the first time
he is smiling
happier than we have ever seen him
elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of tuckers paraphernalia of the paranormal
josh approaches her standing over her
you introduced me to a new world
youve been there before remember
and youll go back
all of us will
maybe i can forget again
he reaches into his jacket taking out the eerie photos lorraine gave him of himself as a child
ill start by giving these back
as he hands them to elise she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled
like the hand of an eighty year old woman
shocked she looks up at his face
she looks haunted
her eyes wide and unnerved
she turns away reaching for something
whats the matter elise
she spins around and lifts tuckers camera up to her face aiming it at him
she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him bathing the whole corridor in white light
josh recoils back in shock
elise lowers the camera
she is terrified
josh suddenly lunges at her slapping the camera out of her hands
why the fuck would you do that
why would you do that
he slams her against the wall his hands around her throat
elise chokes in terror terrified of him
you of all people
why would you do that to me when you know what you know
he abruptly stops attacking her staggering backwards examining his hands as if he cant believe what hes done
seething with fury
elise collapses catching her breath
josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away heading down the corridor
swallowed up by the darkness
renai furrows her brow
what was that
beat to dalton stay here
she gets up
renai jogs into the living room
sees elise lying on the floor
elise what was that noise
elise simply looks up at her
the utter terror on her face is palpable
her neck is bleeding from scratch marks
what happened to you
elise just stares unable to speak
her fear is contagious
she turns and runs into the corridor flicking on the lights
there is nobody there
renai dashes from room to room in the hallway pitching each door open
each room is empty
josh is nowhere to be found
elise stares at tuckers camera in a state of catatonic dread
renai backs into the room her own fear rising in her gut
she leans down and grabs elise by the shoulders
elise what happened
youre scaring me tell me where josh is
elise finally looks up at her
seeing the expert so afraid unnerves renai
when the lion tamer drops his whip and runs you know the lion is vicious
elise opens her mouth to speak
but nothing comes out
instead she simply holds up the camera showing renai the digital display of the photo she took
we do not see it
we simply see the look of horror on renais face
we have returned to the previous scene only now we are seeing it through elises eyes
elise is sitting on the couch alone
trying to recover from the nights events
she glances up when josh approaches her
you introduced me to a new world
youve been there before remember
and youll go back
all of us will
maybe i can forget again
once again we see him reach into his jacket taking out the photos lorraine gave him
ill start by giving these back
as he hands them to elise she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled
shocked she looks up at his face
elise stands up not knowing how to react
she turns away reaching for something
we see her scoop up tuckers digital camera
whats the matter elise
she spins around and lifts tuckers camera up to her face aiming it at him
she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him bathing the whole corridor in white light
and in that split second josh is replaced by the old woman
elise lowers the camera horrified
for a beat the old woman just glares at her
then she charges at elise arms outstretched wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of elises throat
elise chokes eyes bulging spittle flying from her mouth as the pale hands of the old woman dig into her thorax droplets of blood running down her chest where the
yellowing finger nails have cut in to the flesh
the old woman smiles a merciless harlequin grin that mocks elises pain
she lets elise go letting her drop to the floor
the old woman turns and glares down the corridor
something has caught her attention
a distant scream
the door groans open a blade of light penetrating pitch black darkness
the silhouette of the old woman floats ethereally into the bathroom
she steps up to the mirror then reaches into her tattered victorian dress and produces a candle
she lights the candle with a match holding it beneath her chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror
instead of seeing her own reflection though she sees through the mirror as if it were a window
in it she can see the basement of the lamberts previous residence
josh bursts into the basement carrying dalton
put me down i can run
josh sets dalton down who scampers up the stairs
we are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the mirror
josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face
he looks at the old woman
seeing her through the window
come on dad
im right behind you
dalton disappears as josh glares at the woman
what do you want from me
he approaches the mirror
we circle around the old woman past the mirror and through the bathroom wall emerging on the other side in the basement
josh screams at the old woman as she stares at him through what he thinks is a window
they have swapped places
he is now in the further and she is in our world
get away the fuck away from me
im not scared of you just leave me alone
get away from me
we keep circling wiping past joshs back and completing a degree turn through the wall and back into
the old woman smiles at joshs rage
she finds it amusing
with an eerily unblinking gaze she snuffs out the plume of flame with a single puff of breath
plunging the bathroom into darkness
and snuffing out josh forever
