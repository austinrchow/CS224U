written by tony giglio shooting script march th close on
a bronze plaque which reads pearl street on the bridge
rain pours down
an suv steers out of control and crashes into a stalled out vehicle
its quiet now except for the incessant pounding rain
in the distance police lights approach
through a television camera
the image is grainy and frenetic
a heavy rain pours down on a melee of activity
police cars block either end their lights ignite the sky in a dizzying red and blue design
the attention centers on
the suv and the crashed vehicle lay in the middle of the bridge
a man s madness on his face his right hand holds a hostage a woman s racked with fear tight to his body
his left holds a gun
two detectives slowly approach the man
only see the a news reporter karen cross s blond with energy to burn shields herself from the rain steps in front of the camera
police on scene are approaching the suspect
theyre at the center of the bridge now
the man waves his gun wildly screams at the detectives
the hostage tears streaming down her face screams out
three gun shots almost simultaneously ring we have shots fired
shots have been fired
both the suspect and his hostage are down
police are moving in
oh my god
a loft apartment scarcely furnished except for books hundreds of them fill stacks of shelves
hearing but not watching the television meticulously preparing a gin and tonic is
detective quentin conners a grizzled intense veteran
his charisma which he has in spades gets him into as much trouble as it gets him out of
at present a somber mood
the shadows from the rain stream down connerss face
in the glasss reflection
the tv report plays
note most of if not all of the tv report will in reflection
after a two month investigation det
jason york has been relieved of duty for his role in the pearl street bridge shooting deaths of lisa reann and john curtis
key testimony against york came from det
bernard callo who was on scene that night
the seattle police department is handing this case over to the king county district attorneys office
criminal charges are expected
the image cuts to an earlier interview with
captain martin jenkins s chronically tired and unsympathetic
in a civilized society the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else
just because you are a cop doesnt mean laws dont apply to you
this is no longer the wild wild west
karen cross stands on the steps a photo of conners appears
this same review board last week found quentin conners det
yorks partner not responsible for the same shooting
he remains on suspension without pay
conners turns off the tv lays the remote next to a photo of conners and a young woman teddy during happy times
he stares at the photo finishes his drink
a cool crisp pacific northwestern day
mount rainier looms in the distance
the space needle overlooks downtown
while the sun shines now the overcast sky on the horizon foreshadows an impending storm
in the heart of the city
an impressive structure on a busy city corner
traffic street and pedestrian go about their business
across the street
a black truck screeches to a stop
lorenz s sits behind the steering wheel
his eyes cold merciless
hes joined by four other men all black clad heavily armed with body armor
lorenz stares out at the bank a last moment of peace
simultaneously all four doors open and
lorenz and the black clad exit quickly cross the street heading for the bank
each carries a large black bag
patrons in line wait impatiently
a security guard in the corner yawns
tellers count out cash access accounts on grainy security camera images depict an average business day
the calm before the storm
lorenz and the black clad arrive at the doors
they raise their masks and
off the crooked eyebrow of a bank teller
the black clad storm the bank
four of the black clad move into position
lorenz stands center stage
gun in hand he aims at the ceiling pulls the trigger
a gunshot drop to the floor
no sudden moves
to the tellers you
hands on heads drop to your knees
patrons and tellers hit the ground terrified
lorenz is in complete and utter control
black clad and keep watch on the tellers behind the counters
one on one side one on the other
black clad ushers people out of side offices gun points them into the lobby
black clad races upstairs gathers people from the nd level forces them downstairs
from the corner of lorenzs eye
the security guards hand creeps toward his gun
you dont want to do
the security guard reluctantly obeys
black clad disarms the guard then gun butts him over the head
the guard drops unconscious
customers employees scream out
black clad rips keys from the guards belt tosses them to black clad
yall picked the wrong day not to use the atm
beat you will not be harmed if you do exactly what i say when i say it
you lorenz contd take your chances if you choose not to listen
black clad keys in hand flies across the counter carrying a large duffel bag
heading to the vaults
no one will say i didnt give you a choice
black clad arrives drops his bag unzipping
into his headset im in
lorenz gets the message finds the bank manager cowering behind his desk
the bank manager obeys you understood what i just said
your security system you can electronically lock all entrances
right right away
with that attitude you and i are going to get along famously
the bank manager nods nervously
black clad holds open his bag
he strides by the customers who deposit cellphones pagers inside
the bank manager taps on his computer keyboard
were locked down
black clad flips the bank closed sign around
jenkins fastens his cufflinks
in the bed behind him
heather teddy galloway s normally a force to reckon with appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around her
have you seen my watch
teddy gestures to the night stand
jenkins retrieves the watch
he also slides his wedding ring back on
this aint love this is a relationship of convenience
jenkins slips on his jacket secures his tie and after one last check in the mirror
this was fun
you should get out of bed
youll be late for work
and with that jenkins exits
teddy waits for the door to close then collapses back onto the bed
plastic explosives line the walls connect all the safety deposit boxes together
black clad takes cover readies the detonation device and
into his headset fire in the hole
he flips a switch and
an explosion rips through a pillow of smoke blows into the lobby
lorenz stands unflinching
the explosion was expected
an eager teller s seizes the moment
he reaches up and black clad turns just in time to see it quickly fires his weapon
the eager teller slumps against the wall bleeds profusely from his neck not dead yet
lorenz hustles over to black clad
what do you think youre doing
fucker pushed the alarm
lorenz glares disgustedly at his accomplice
it wouldve made more sense to shoot him before he pushes the fucking alarm
looks at the eager teller jesus
lorenz levels very calmly his weapon at the eager tellers head and
if youre going to do something
fires his weapon
do it right
the eagers tellers body keels over dead
lorenz checks his watch
into microphone alarms tripped
were on a clock
to black clad get these people out of the way
the four seasons it aint
theres not enough soap on the planet for teddy to feel clean
doubt and fear present on her face
she turns off the water and steps out
when she does her pager off screen chimes
teddy a towel wrapped around her picks up the pager
she picks up the telephone dials
beat then this is detective galloway
police cars brake hard blocking traffic
officers fly out shotguns out
news vans speed onto the scene as the crowds builds
standing in the center of things
detective bernie callo s a stern by the book cop
not a popular member of the force
two officers s follow him
into his radio i want all points of entry identified and covered
we need swat here now
have emergency crews standing by
re the media didnt take them long
set a perimeter
a phone cord is yanked from the wall
black clad and push customers and employees inside
they door slams shut
pov of lorenz callo approaches the tech van
lorenz peeks through the curtains
a phone pressed between his shoulder and ear
he places a voice modulator over the phones mouthpiece this will leave his voice sounding lifeless and distorted to those on the receiving end
callo arrives at the police tech van
so state of the art nasa is green with envy
brendan dax s the techno wizard with headphones on hands callo a phone
several other officers listen in
we have them on the line
dax presses a series of buttons
into phone this is detective callo seattle p
who am i speaking with
its time to set the rules
i am in complete control of this facility
no one gets in or out without my say and i will execute every last man woman and child in here if my needs are not met
do not test me
today i am a man of zero patience
see if you cant screw this up detective
i have but one demand
one and only demand
conners wears a t shirt and some sweats opens his refrigerator grabs a bottle of water
when he closes the door
he notices jenkins and a young detective on his deck
conners crosses opens the door for jenkins and detective shane dekker late s
dekkers all business when it comes to being a cop
green but eager to prove himself
after a long beat
do you have a warrant
i need to speak to you quentin
theres where your shit out of luck because i dont need to speak to you
conners and jenkins trade serious stares
conners finally relents
jenkins and dekker enter
dekker notices the quentin this is detective shane dekker
you dont look like much of a detective
i was going to say the same about you
shane just transferred in from tacoma
save your breath
i really dont care
before jenkins can respond from the bedroom a tall blond woman s emerges completely nude
the men watch as the woman paying them no attention retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge then returns to the bedroom
no words spoken at all
after the moment has passed
why dont we can the chit chat
get to whats on your mind
weve got a hostage situation american national bank
the sonsabitches said they wouldnt talk to anyone but you
i need you to do this
why should i
because peoples lives are at stake
that takes priority over your ego
to jenkins re dekker you may want to put a leash on him
beat thinks saying i did want to help
im still suspended or did that slip your mind
the commissioners office has ordered me to reinstate you
as of now youre back on the force
just like that
just like that
beat i wont however unleash you alone
always a catch
shane here is your new partner
consider him a younger version of me looking over your shoulder watching every move you make
the idea of a new partner doesnt sit well with conners
dont think i endorse this
if it were my call youd be with your partner
you mean ex partner
on the unemployment line with him
for a moment there i thought you cared
i care about those innocent people down there
i hope to god someone hasnt made a monumental mistake letting you back in
i appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me
i look forward to the continuing positive relationship weve shared in the past
police corral the ever growing group of spectators
a swat truck pulls up the back doors fly open
swat exit in a flurry race into position
amidst the commotion
jenkins car navigates the scene stops next to
karen cross immediately recognizes conners orders her cameraman to center on him
conners dekker and jenkins climb out of the car head towards the crime scene when
detective can we have a few words
conners turns recognizes karen
relishing the moment
ill give you two
pauses for effect blow me
if you need a follow up comment let me know
to dekker cunt made her career off me
conners dekker and jenkins arrive find teddy her hair still wet with her partner det
vincent durano s a middle of the road never out on a limb type cop
callo looks on the rage boiling inside of him
completely ignores callo nice to see you both
conners has been reinstated to full active duty
its his scene
this info comes as a surprise
especially to callo
the last hostage situation this guy headed an innocent civilian died
i was not responsible
you never are
that girl would be alive today if it werent for your cowboy antics
you destroy lives
look whos talking about destroying lives
decisions been made bernie
i was first on scene and i have seniority
pleads dont do this martin
well talk about it later
take a hike
ill watch this train wreck from home
sarcastic im going to miss him
swat because of the special circumstances will defer to conners
hes in charge
first time ive heard swat defer to anyone
pulls aside conners second chances dont come around often
dont blow it
jenkins skeptically eyes conners before stepping away
he motions for dekker to walk with him
anything questionable happens today you let me know
out of earshot conners watches dekker and jenkins
looks like you got yourself a baby sitter
conners glares at teddy out the corner of his eye then dismisses the comment
more spectators more media
conners dekker teddy and vincent hover behind the first barricade
conners unwraps gum sticks it in his mouth
we have approximately four to seven heavily armed men holding an unspecified number of customers and employees hostage
youre just a wealth of knowledge arent you
witnesses heard shots fired and some kind of explosion
and their only demand has been to speak with you
im sure it wont be the last
get me a line into the bank
lets see what they really want
lorenz enters shuts the door and removes his mask
he lets a few rings pass before answering
into voice modulator detective conners
conners and company gather outside of the police tech van
dekker pulls a pad and a pen prepares to take notes
dax sits headphones donned records the entire conversation
who am i speaking with
you can call me lorenz
dekker writes lorenz
okay lorenz how are we doing in there
can we get you anything
food medical supplies
we heard an explosion
everyone who matters is fine
of course i wouldve preferred not having the authorities involved at all
we werent planning to be here this long
but since seattles finest needs a presence on the scene im glad its you
my fame proceeds me
dont be flattered
i needed someone whos been through the experience before
hopefully this time it will go better for all involved
i plan on living a full long and rich life
i didnt however expect them to find you so quickly
i thought you were suspended
dekker writes in the know on his pad
i was but im back
youre informations old
you never get what you pay for
back to business you want to know about the hostages
how many and are they okay
dekker scribbles pro
approximately forty theyre fine considering
all except one
we had a situation
put to practice isnt always perfect
cant expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may
randomly decide to revolt
has some order to it
conners drifts in thought detective
are you still with me
teddy snaps her fingers
that gets conners attention
theres a new intensity to his demeanor
what else will i be looking for
probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home
safe to say
stay by the phone
ill contact you shortly
dont worry i have no plans until sunrise tomorrow so hunker down
its going to be a long one
wait were talking here
we dont want another pearl street bridge do we
connerss thrown by the mention of pearl street bridge
lorenz abruptly hangs up
the crowds grow
the media build up intensifies
through a television camera
karen cross reports this standoff is approaching two hours now
weve been told detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank
whether any specific demands have been made we cannot confirm
as soon as we know something well pass it on to you
reporting live karen cross channel two news
who the hell writes this shit
black clad and remove from their bag ropes pulleys an iron spike and hammer
a spear gun
connects the rope to a spear
fires the spear into the wall above the banks front windows
he snags a nd spear repeats
the detectives huddle
impatience level high
to dax try again
hes not picking up
stern try again
dax humbled does as ordered
glances about wheres our fearless captain
went uptown to brief the commissioner
so youre here in his place
conners fumbles with the wrapper but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth
shock you quit smoking
caffeine too if you must know
another shock what
a mans capable of change
a man yes
im not so sure
dont worry i still have a vice or two
try again in five
what are they doing in there
wasting our time
the word rings in connerss head
he starts to put it together
he knows police protocol not to mention the shit in our own precinct
hes disguising his voice means hes got a record and has done this before
hes heavily armed and well connected
he knows hes surrounded
he hasnt asked for a damned thing
he drops that hint about sunrise prepping us for a long wait
hes buying time
brainstorming to figure out his next move
he wasnt expecting us
no he wasnt expecting you
he said he thought you were still suspended
probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me
giving him the time he needs
he almost has what he came for
conners nods eyes dekker as if for the first time
hes got what he came for and hes waiting for his ticket out of here
the decision were going in
the bank has three points of entry
teddy and vincent take a swat team head to the west side
well have the swat commander take the east
dekker youre with me
where is the swat commander
ill find him
vincent leaves conners with dekker and teddy
to conners concern thats a big call quentin
thought about what youre doing
you questioning me teddy
i question how you can fuck that asshole and still manage to look in the mirror
im not going to get into this now
and youre one to talk
interrupting the hostages are in imminent danger
theyve confessed to killing someone an automatic murder one charge thats a life sentence maybe a needle for all of them
so why keep witnesses around to testify
longer we wait the greater the risk
we need to go in
beat then relents okay
even dekker seems to agree with that theory
vincent arrives with the swat commander s a former navy seal with a dont fuck with me attitude
i got snipers up top and ten soldiers on the ground
whats the best way in
tear gas blow the doors
i got forty civilians in there too great a chance
any other way
theres no pussy way in
the doors are locked electronically from the inside
we aint getting in without force
beat thinks what if we cut the power
that will disable the system and we can open the locks manually come in that way
thinks concedes thatll work
so well take the pussy way commander
we cut the power and go in at sharp
snipers on rooftops ready their weapons
swat team moves into position cover all bank entrances
conners and dekker slip into bulletproof vests
teddy vincent and the swat commander arrive
the banks equipped with emergency generators which once the powers down will kick back on in approximately minutes
it will be over before that
commander your men in position
i will call for the power to be cut
once down wait for my signal and enter
no one moves until i give the go understood
they all nod
you have done this before right
i dont want to know
various shots of hostages
its quiet until
black clad and burst grab two random hostages drag them out
they put up some fight but quickly concede
the hostages sit shaking crying
scared beyond belief
lorenz watches out the window
pov of lorenz swat police getting into position
lorenz turns from the window
black clad and drag the two random hostages kicking and screaming towards the anchor pulley
what are you doing
let me go
fasten the hostages to ropes connected to the pulleys
behind a barricade conners crouches down beside dekker and his swat team
into radio lets go around the horn
teddy vincent and a swat team
the swat commander and his team
a sniper holds his eye to the scope
conners glances at his watch
here we go
cut the power
everything blacks out
lights computers etc
the hostages grab each other tightly
lorenz and the black clad calmly react
conners makes the call
each team makes their move when
into his headset now
black clad pulls a cord instantly
all the curtains conners freezes
into radio hold it
what just happened
black clad flips a switch
suddenly a canister attached to the pulleys race up the ropes
the hostages have their feet yanked out from under them then shoot into the air
they smash through a glass handrail on the second floor then
shoot to the top of the wall length windows
they hang dangle helplessly
on full display for the outside to see
looking up at the windows holy shit
everyone in the vicinity react in horror
the news crews led by karen cross race to grab the story
the swat commander were going in
officers try to control the situation but cant
pedestrians racing around
conners in the middle of the anarchy
do not go in
its a trap
stand down detective
this is my show now
flustered the swat commander makes his own call
on my count
the swat team bum rushes the bank just as
a fireball blasts through the door blows off its hinges
the swat guys are blown off their feet
everyone outside is blown off their feet
conners dekker simultaneously an explosions blasts out the west side doors
its a genuine war zone
smoke fire and debris litter the conners peers up as
the hostages run out scream in conners and dekker head for the bank pass two groups of four to the first group round up all the hostages anyone that comes
conners glares at dekker
to the second the rest of you come with us
the officers rush to protect the hostages pull them to safety
camera crews and reporters pounce on the opportunity
conners and dekker lead the charge inside guns drawn
emergency lights burn
glass crackles under foot as conners dekker and the officers move through
caution with each step
the lobbys clear
conners pulls the officers close
whispers to dekker we split up
whispers to the officers you two with him
you two with me
to dekker check the back
dekker nods leads his group away
conners spots a door in the back marked bank employees only
dekker checks it out but its empty
the remnants of the explosion remain
the generators roar to life
dekker jumps startled by the sudden blast of lights
all the lights come up as
conners kicks in the door but
dekker leads his group
his heart pounding through his chest
his gun up and ready
a noise up ahead
he bares down takes a deep breath carefully proceeds until
teddy and vincent emerge
teddy exhales lowers her weapon
so does dekker
conners strides out from behind the counters
to vincent see anyone come your way
no one went by me
the swat commander approaches holding a couple of the black masks some black body armor
we found these
conners takes one of the masks in his hands
we let them walk right past us
dekker teddy the swat commander officers vincent and the swat team stand in the middle of the lobby stunned
conners his anger simmers to a boil until finally
an officer unfurls a fresh roll of police caution tape around the scene
still mayhem but gradually coming under control
police interview hostages so do reporters
paramedics administer oxygen
two coroners load the eager tellers body into their truck
vincent covered in debris confers with conners
we got the one teller dead the two that were strung up are alive but in critical condition
a few swat incurred nd degree burns but thats the worst of it
now depending on who you talk to
there was anywhere from five to nine perps
and nobody got a good look at any ofem wore their masks the whole time
dax is rounding up the security tapes now
that should give us a firm number
i want background checks on every hostage
theyre all suspects until theyre not
you dont think one of thems still here
after this nothing would surprise me
dax pulls cables power cords etc
getting set to go inside with them
i need to listen to the conversation between lorenz and conners again
itll have to wait
too long show me how to play it myself
look this isnt how it works
i dont take orders from you
i dont know you and no one touches my stuff
youre going to have to wait
dax gets his shit starts to go
dekker waits then proceeds into the van
dax turns notices
dekker inspects the equipment when
what the hell are you doing
along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind
a mans dead and the killers are running free
i dont have time to wait
looks at the equipment ill figure it out
thanks for your help
relents demonstrates here
this dat machine
play stop rewind
its just like using a tape player
headphones are jacked in
tapes already inside
a car pulls up
jenkins steps out
stares out over the scene the mess
hes a volcano ready to erupt
a series of eight black and white video monitors
as we rewind
seven of the eight show recorded images of the bank
the eighth shows only static
dax sits in front of the monitors
conners stands nearby
re the eighth monitor whats with this one
thats the camera in the vault
it blew in the first explosion
the seven different monitors all begin in sync
timecode burns in the corner
the hostages are dragged across the lobby where the black clads hook them up to the pulleys
the black clads get into position
conners carefully scrutinizes the images
the timecode clock hits am and
thats when you cut the power
so we cant id them
theres a four minute fifty two second gap before the image returns
theyre long gone by then
beat thinks go to the head of the tapes from when they first went in
document each move theyve made for the two hours they were inside
you got it
awful lotta news cameras outside
maybe one got a look at them coming out
good idea have vincent check it out
conners you better come out here
conners and teddy walk in to discover
captain jenkins confers with four fbi agents in suits
to teddy shit
jenkins turns to conners gestures him over
detective conners join us would you
dekker listens through headphones makes notes as he goes
beat stern what does that mean
put to practice isnt always perfect
cant expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may
randomly decide to revolt
has some order to it
dekker hits stop then rewind
he checks his
several words and phrases fill the page
lorenz sunrise pro theory hostages theory randomly revolt and chaos
dekker studies the words intently figuring something out
he presses play on the dat machine
put to practice isnt always perfect
cant expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may
randomly decide to revolt
has some order to it
dekker presses stop
dekker finds a pattern circles the words lorenz chaos theory
conners jenkins and teddy converse with agent victor doyle s and the bank manager still a bit rattled
prince amar alle alban is one of the wealthiest and least popular arabs in the middle east
theres been countless threats on his life and fortune in the past
but for better of worse
he is an ally to the united states
the prince keeps a safe deposit box in twenty institutions agent doyle contd across the country
along with this bank he also had a box at eastern federal savings in charlotte north carolina which was hit last month
what was in the box
we dont keep records
the boxes are private
since we screen for live tissue viruses or explosives but if it passes those tests we dont ask
this is all real fascinating shit but what about the money
bank robbers still like cash dont they
the cash drawers dont appear touched
neither does the cash vault
so they broke into a bank and didnt steal any money
odd glances all about
we believe the princes box was the target
were trying to reach him now
agent doyle and the bank manager leave
helluva come back conners
are you familiar with the term franchise sized fuck up
depends are we talking about your sex life
because ive heard shortcomings
you got played quentin
congratulations you just topped pearl street bridge
thats not fair
it was by the book
everything was according to standard procedure
jenkins ignores teddy
you came to me
i didnt ask for this
commissioners office is scrambling to cover their ass
they need a scapegoat
and i have zero problems serving you up
you wanted this to happen
but if it had to happen to somebody
i think this lorenz was trying to tell us something
you dont say
the way he spoke
he paused before certain words
have you ever heard of the chaos theory
a grade b rating tops
customers dine choke down coffee
empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table
conners finishes a cup of coffee enjoys a slice of pie
dekker all about work goes over his notes
edward lorenz invented the chaos theory in the s
its the study of phenomena that appear random but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically
confused try that again
initial state of events may seem unrelated and random but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together
the waitress refills conners coffee lays down the check
anything else officers
thatll be all
to dekker youre a college boy
someplace ive heard of or one of those inbred state schools no ones heard of
not exactly princeton but not bad
how did you end up on the force
its kind of the family business
what your dad dads dad and so on and so back
dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info
do we really need all this get to know you crap
couple hours ago you didnt give a shit
youve grown on me
besides i am entrusting my life to you
i should know something about you
i would conners contd think youd like to know a little something about me
i know about you detective
you dont say that with much enthusiasm
not much to be enthusiastic about
conners reaches his limit
time to put him in place
listen my reputation often proceeds me
you however have no reputation a fact i need to deal with
after youve been through the shit i have then you can judge me
we can try to work together make the best of a bad situation or we can compare dick sizes all day
up to you
but since this is your first day here
over radio conners come in
both men hold steely stares on one another
into radio go
got something youll want to see
conners drops a ten dollar bill on the table
i dont like the pac
im an ivy league guy
conners gets up heads for the door
dekker humbled scoops up connerss ten puts it in his wallet and drops a twenty down on the table slides out of the booth
conners dekker and teddy approach a news truck
vincent stands with karen cross and her cameraman who sports two to conners w a smile detective
cant keep away from me can you
conners ignores her but dekker doesnt
he gives her the once over
she notices smiles
he points to a monitor in the van presses play
handheld images of the post bank melee
hostages scatter in all directions
cops race into the bank
a shaggy brown haired man s with a moustache and an angry expression charges towards the camera and barrels over it
knocks the camera and the cameraman down
to the cameraman well that explains you
to karen rewind it a little bit
she does until
the image freezes on the shaggy mans face
busted him two years ago on attempted robbery of the western federal bank
whats he doing back on the street
he gave up his partners and cut a deal with the d
gotta love the system
got an address
only thing on file is in spokane but i recall he did have a girlfriend in town
gina i believe
the streets are quiet
a row of harley davidsons park in front
above the bar a small lower class apartment complex
two police officers along with conners dekker teddy and vincent position themselves by the apartment
vincent knocks his fist on the door
gina its the police
theres no response
but sounds can be heard on the opposite side of the door
pounds louder we can hear you
again no response
to vincent low step back
clear the door
just as vincent does
a gunshot blows apart the door
fired from the inside of the apartment
the blasts keep coming
everyones pinned down on the defensive
dekker gathers himself together
conners turns into the open doorway fires a full clip into conners reloads
a thin layer of smoke hovers
but thats all
nobody in sight
conners steps inside just as he reaches the living room
this one from the bedroom
conners drops to the floor falls back into the kitchen
dekker enters the apartment
into radio shots fired officer down
need an ambulance and back up
dekker passes the kitchen door looks in on conners
in pain im fine
off screen a window breaks
from the bedroom
dekker heads that way
damon richards crawls onto the fire escape
in the doorway but richards doesnt
he fires another shotgun blast
dekker ducks back into the living room
he aims his gun into the bedroom without looking
a bullet hits richards in the shoulder
he yelps in pain but manages to
richards scrambles out
dekker looks inside the bedroom doesnt see richards
he takes one step inside when
gina s latino wearing only a pair of red panties with no bra runs up behind dekker and jumps on his back fists dekker pushes her down aims his gun
vincent enters grabs gina
dekker runs to the bedroom window peeks out over
clutches his shoulder in pain yet fearlessly charges downward
into radio suspect fleeing on foot
north on curson
hes armed and dangerous
im in pursuit
a beat over radio and who are you
but hes already gone
dekker hops onto the fire escape hoofs down the iron stairs
drops to the pavement
heads for the street
dekker a flight from the bottom realizes his disadvantage and hurls himself over the rail
hits the ground hard jumps up shaking it off
stays in pursuit
dekker races around the corner
a ford f spins the corner
dekker jerks out his glock
bullets ricochet off the grill sparks fly
but this train aint slowing down
the f swerves clips a harley
dekker jumps before impact bounces off the hood and rolls away
the truck hits the street speeds away
dekker grimacing through the pain scrapes himself off the pavement
dekkers eyes dance
spot the harleys
im a police officer in pursuit of a murder suspect
i need your bike now
beat tosses the keys its all yours
dekker picks up the bike hops on
fires up the engine
richards truck speeds around a slow moving vehicle and whips into an alley
the slow vehicle skids to a stop
dekkers hog cuts inside between the vehicle and the sidewalk rips into the alley
richards fishtails down the alley
barely maintaining control
garbage dumpsters are littered about creating an obstacle course
richards barrels out of the alley through the intersection and into another alley
opposing traffic skids out
angry drivers let him have it
dekker skids sideways steers around the blockage
catches sight of
down the block
a patrol car speeds down hastings street
dekker revs the engine maneuvers around the angry drivers and follows richards into the second alley
conners behind the wheel speeds towards the scene
richards races checks the rearview mirror
dekkers hog closing in
the alley exits onto richards street
richards approaches the mouth of the alley just as a street cleaner appears starts to block the exit
richards stamps on the accelerator speeds through the small opening just past the street cleaner
dekkers not so lucky
sees the street cleaner too late
lays out the hog and rolls just as
the hog slides into the street cleaner
dekker gets up looks down the street sees
richards getting away speeds down the street through another intersection when
conners in a patrol car plows into the rear of the truck spinning it around
dekker races towards the crash site
conners climbs out of the car
richards shakes his head clearing it
blood squirts from his mouth
he sees through the windshield conners coming for him
he scrambles for his handgun looks up to see conners but hes not there
richards turns as
conners appears in the drivers side window grabs the back of richards head and slams it into the steering wheel
conners reaches inside grabs the handgun
as dekker arrives
his last words before passing out
a half a dozen crime scene investigators go through the place
gina a cops jacket around her is led away in handcuffs
a paramedic s checks conners out
teddy concludes her cellphone conversation
to conners re richards hes unconscious with a nice knot on his forehead but stable
three officers are watching the room
he wakes they call
to the paramedic hey quincy give it a rest im fine
beat quincy was a coroner
you may have a cracked rib
you should go to the hospital
i should do a lot of things
the paramedic gives up exits
teddy leans down beside conners
you sure youre all right
conners and teddy share a look when
girls name is gina lopez twenty eight
done some time for possession has two kids
am i interrupting
gina claims she doesnt know anything about a bank robbery
of course she doesnt
vincent trudges out of the kitchen
haveem put ms
lopez in interrogation one and turn the a c on full
leave her alone and cold
let me know when her nipples can cut glass
to dekker detective
i didnt realize when we first met who you were
i worked with your father
it was only for a brief time when i first got outta the academy but it was an honor
surprised your father was harry dekker
i wish it couldve been for longer
conners looks at dekker in a new light
dekker starts away until
new subject that was some fancy riding
you have a bike
used to but i sold it
shows his scrape on his arm theyre dangerous
marnie rollins s a csi officer wears gloves pokes her head in the room
ready for you
two large suitcases rest open on the bed
marnie prepares a report
somebody going on a trip
looks like it dont it
marnie youre looking well
heard you were back conners
and keep dreaming
marnie gives dekker an amorous glance which he returns
to dekker you on the other hand
i gotta bike myself
maybe we can go for a ride sometime
or maybe i can just ride you
conners looks at both of them
can we get back to work
we got passports sun tan lotion bermuda shorts thong bikini hopefully hers and this
she opens a large duffel bag
conners and dekker look inside the bag
its full of cash
must be a fifty large there easy
youd think right
dont put words in my mouth but
two things jump out here
first each bank branch has their own money bands
this is not american nationals
after a little checking it belongs to pacific savings of seattle
that sounds familiar
four months ago a half million dollars was stolen in an armed robbery there
just a smash n grab job
they caught the guys a day later recovering about
those guys have been in lock up since and their trials still pending
which leads us to point number two
do you smell that
smells the bills grimaces what is it
when evidence is taken in any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints so to mark it we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill
is that new
wave of the future
gotta keep up with the times conners
so this moneys not from our bank
this is the money from the pacific savings job and our evidence room
smiling to dekker now
for a list of things you can put in my mouth
conners and dekker confer with teddy and vincent
do you remember who headed up the pacific savings case
i think it was callo
just thinking out loud
conners and dekker head back to the police station
its quiet between these two until
when you said it was your family business i didnt think
i guess i just didnt connect the dots
dont worry about it
your father was a hero
yes he was
at first i thought maybe you were related to the captain
the captain he just kind of discovered you
through the academy to excellent evaluation reports while conners contd on the beat to the high test scores on the detectives exam
something like that
thats how he found me
this surprises dekker
maybe were not as different as you think
a small cold room with a large mirror along the west wall
gina sits at the table shivering
her breath visible so are her nipples through a white seattle p
conners paces around her like a circling shark
dekkers in the corner observing
we found the money
that money was dwaynes
that money came from our evidence room
i told you
i dont know nothing about a bank robbery
whatever damon was into i didnt know
so where were you going
this isnt possession or solicitation gina
this is felony murder one
you could get life
i didnt do nothing
frustrated its i didnt do anything
didnt do nothing is a double negative infers the positive
the grammar in this country sucks
then i didnt do any thing
conners takes a seat next to gina
his eyes burn through her
this isnt going away
you want to walk out of here you tell me something
i swear i dont know
now im done talking
i want a lawyer
dekker lowers his head
you sure thats what you want
then its two phone calls ill make
the first will be to the public defenders office
the second to childrens services
suddenly ginas bravado disappears
suddenly a scared and lonely girl
if you insist on a lawyer i take your kids
not like you cared about them anyway
you were ready to fly the coop with shit for brains
you cant do that
i can and i will
tell me what i want to know
dekker stares incredulously at conners
broken i dont know anything
please dont take my kids
conners stares into ginas eyes
shes telling the truth
conners wraps his coat around ginas shoulders
get her some coffee
dekker and conners
you believe her
i think for the first time in that girls life shes telling the truth
you had to know once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable
who wouldve known
it wouldve been my word against hers
who do you think the jury wouldve believed
justice by any means
even if you cross the line
the only line around here is the blue line you cross that one then you got conners contd problems
ask callo he knows what im talking about
teddy enters hands conners a sheet of paper with evidence item scribbled on it
those serial numbers marnie faxed me
according to our computers that money should be downstairs
occupies almost the entire basement of the police station
a steel cage protects the contents
conners and dekker wait
no ones working at present
dekker peers inside anxiously looking for someone
dekker rings the service bell
harry hume s the cop on watch limps to the desk
crotchety with an overgrown belly franks seen better days
theres no love loss between harry and conners
cold buzz us in
colder you gotta sign first
conners and dekker scribble their signatures down
i heard you were back
kinda liked not having you around conners
harry takes the clipboard examines it until satisfied
then reluctantly buzzes them in
have another donut frankie
dekker and conners proceed inside
they walk along the vast rows of evidence scan the shelves checking the number
that fat fuck is the sole guardian of the citys biggest source of contraband
conners contd all totalled about million or so just sitting here for the taking
finally finding the right row they turn in
youd have to have some major firepower not to mention an extra large set of balls to try and knock off a police station
not if you were a cop
you could just walk right in and
an empty space marked in tape item
take whatever you want
dekker and conners surround harry as he digs through his file box
after a few moments grabs a clipboard
here is it
like i said
no one takes anything out of here unless they sign for it
he showed you a warrant
you dont remember
you know how many times someone signs shit in and out
i see the same guys all the time
i cant remember one instance two weeks ago
but if his signatures there that means he signed for it
take it up with him
jenkins listens as conners and crew brief the situation
the money from richardss place traced back to the pacific savings heist a few months ago a case callo headed up
callo signed the money out of evidence two weeks ago
if its callo it would explain how they knew police protocol and how our department operates
also explains why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by conners
he wanted to be the point so everything went according to plan
he doesnt need another reason to be pissed at me
what about motive
do we have one
pressure mightve been getting to him
hes been getting the cold shoulder from cops since he testified about pearl street bridge
dont buy that
beat he was also getting divorced
this is news to everyone
about a month ago he told me he and his wife might be splitting
asked if i knew a lawyer who wouldnt clean him out
i didnt think it was this bad
conflicted bernie callo is a first rate cop
a boy scout
this doesnt make any sense
they never do captain
dont act like youre not enjoying this conners
i know what you think of him
doesnt matter what i think
facts here speak for themselves
no they dont
we havent asked the question
why if callos involved dont they ask for him at the bank
points to conners they asked for you
all eyes find conners
then jenkins phone rings
answering the phone jenkins
the small home in a rural area is now completely surrounded by cop cars
a typical family themed home
family pictures adorn the walls
everything in its right place
callo s sits in the kitchen sobbing
police encircle her
in the center of the living room
bernie callo lies dead a bullet wound right between the eyes
several uniformed officers and csi officers muddle through every nook and cranny of the tiny home
conners teddy and dekker are led around by a uniformed officer
wife came home approximately forty five minutes ago
found him here
none of the neighbors heard anything
theres no forced entry and no one saw anyone fleeing the scene
vincent enters from the basement carrying a large box
blueprints from the bank schematics pictures
also about a dozen internet articles on the saudi prince
found it behind the furnace
well thats it right
the house telephone rings
everyone peers around
after the second ring the answering machine picks youve reached the callo residence
no one can get to the phone right now
please leave a message
after the tone
from the machine detective conners
are you there
conners and everyone turns listens
lorenz stares ahead transfixed by something
are you connecting the dots
are you putting it together
is the pattern emerging
they wouldnt punish you but i will
conners grabs the phone
vengeance will be mine detective
then come and get me you piece of shit
lorenz smiles hangs up
he resumes staring at the wall in front of him
dekker leans back against the car conners approaches
what they told callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things
clearly this wasnt part of a plan callo wouldve agreed with
youd think a cop would be smarter
as cops we come across every temptation in the book
money drugs power
wed all like to think we can resist any urge but
were not saints
so callo was involved and now theyre dragging you into it
man said he wanted vengeance
piss anyone off lately
both cant help but smile
jenkins walks up
i just got off the phone with agent doyle
after the charlotte break in the prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country
let me get this straight they didnt touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes
break into a bank blow it up and steal nothing
to conners still make sense to you
nothing about today makes sense
dekker watches as bernie callos body is loaded into the coroners vehicle
teddy assists mrs
callo into a police car
vincent carries the box of evidence from the home
dekkers mind works overtime then
return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain
for it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path
conners and jenkins share a confused look
to jenkins dont look at me hes your find
say that again detective
we go back to where this all started
we go to the bank
the sun sinks below the horizon
as night settles police and emt workers are still on site
dekker and conners watch as dax operates
the tapes confirm five bad guys but since the vault cam blew in the explosion what they did in there was a mystery
on a computer monitor the eight security camera angles appear
on the multiple screens
just as in the opening lorenz leads this crew through the bank
immediately the group splits up
in the vault
one of the black clads arrives and radios in
ive been through these tapes twenty times already and nothing
in the vault black clad fires the explosives
the image goes to static
wait hold on a second
did you see it
go back a little
notice the camera angles theyre all fixed
they dont rotate or pan
dax rewinds to before the explosion
look closely camera five the vault cam dominates our attention because of the explosion
but while thats happening check out camera two customer service
several bank employees cower to the black clad
suddenly another black clad disappears underneath the whered he go
as the explosion goes off camera pans away he moved it
changed the angle
he didnt want us to see something
whats in that corner they didnt want us to see
dax rewinds the tapes again before the camera was moved and freezes frame on a lone computer terminal in the corner
at the computer terminal
a forensics technician s carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints
dekker and conners look on
are you at all concerned that theres some whacko out there looking to get you
if i worried about every threat made against me id never leave the house
the technician turns on a black light and
fingerprints conners looks to dekker impressed
to the technician those are priority one
if hes got a record i want an i
im on my way
dax can you hack in there and find out what they were doing on this machine
hack into a nationwide banks central computer system
what do we do in the meantime
you like italian
the italian restaurant host s jolly with a thick accent greets conners and dekker
detective where you been
much too long
i give you best table in house
itll just be the two
more are coming
whos this young man
for all intents and purposes
hes big brother
confused hes your brother
no matter no matter
i bring you bottle of house wine
were still on duty
insulted no wine
a little wine
they get to the table conners looks at it
last time i was here you said that table in the corner was the best in the house
anywhere you sit becomes best table in house
now relax i bring you food
a piano player recreates the sweet sounds of italy
patrons sing along
eating drinking and being merry
vincent and teddy have joined conners and dekker
a mountain of food still remains
a couple bottles of wine have been consumed empty plates and basket rolls spread about
the mood is happy light
not thinking about their day
conners tells an anecdote something that teddy and vincent have heard before but dont care
dekker watches the detectives admires in their closeness
shane what was that thing you said back at the house about returning to the beginning path or something
its a buddhist story
were all ears
one day the buddha found his heart in turmoil
so he retreats to the forest to the earth to the base of a great tree and im paraphrasing but
this elephant comes up and tells buddha he doesnt like seeing him discouraged
he can talk to an elephant
hes the buddha
hes attained the th level of consciousness
hes capable of communicating with plants trees
the buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from the beginning to find the path the answer
so when you hit a dead end go back to the beginning to find your way
or something like that
we have a genuine philosopher in our midst
youre a buddhist
just something i picked up along the way
but youre religious
conners stares curiously at his new partner
then excuses himself to go to the mens room
youre all pretty tight
weve been through a lot together
i guess i just thought
i dont know
with all the trouble hes been in lately coming back from suspension everyone would treat him differently
you cant believe what you read or see on tv
if anything our tie to conners is stronger
hes one of the best
even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked he was in control
that doesnt just happen
hes just that good
teddy heads for the ladies room
what was the buddha looking for
the divine in himself
dekkers cellphone rings
how long does it usually take to for fingerprints to be idd
hours maybe days
we could be waiting a while
snapping the phone shut
they got a match
long curtains divide the rooms
conners exits the mens room teddy appears and before a word can be spoken
she kisses him hard passionately on the lips
conners gives in for just a moment
he breaks the embrace
what are you doing
i realized something today
being around you all thats happened
i think i made a mistake
its too late
youve made your choice
live with it
this jab hurts teddy and conners knows it
dekker parts the curtains
we got a match
teddy separates from conners
you got a name
a knowing disgust sonofabitch
conners drives dekker reads chris leis file
on top of the file is a mugshot photo of lei chris
hes an early s chinese american with a weasel factor off the charts
prick used to work for some big time software company until they caught him dipping into the companys slush fund
they didnt want the publicity so they didnt press charges
couple years later he was busted for looting the pension plans of retired cops
for a genius
hes a fucking moron
this was your case
you and york
you made the bust
why didnt it stick
his lawyer put us on trial
said we were crooked abusive that we planted evidence
we were in the midst of the pearl street bridge fallout
jury bought it
they let him walk and we were the scapegoats
was it true
the guy was guilty
he was scum
that was the truth
beat theres something they dont teach you
the system breaks down
you have to compensate to get results
that gives you the right to break the rules
if it means justice
another thing they dont teach you
off the main road sits a dark two story home on a hillside
the design is modern flawless and cold
every room is equipped with video cameras and monitors
on the monitor
the screen is divided into small boxes showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house
our concentration settles on box
chris lei live and in the flesh quickly stuffs belongings into a suitcase
hes nervous tense
from the top drawer of his dresser he grabs an armful of underwear socks dumps them into the suitcase
what chris doesnt see
conners pulls the car to the curb
he and dekker hop out
from his second floor window chris sees conners and dekker
chris turns finds himself staring down a barrel
fare thee well chris
chris swallows lorenz pulls the trigger and
the gunshot echoes outside
conners and dekker draw their weapons quickly descend on the house
the front door kicks in
dekker and conners cautiously enter
they move the way veteran partners would
no indications that these two just met today
the house is almost pitch black
conners motions that hes going up signals for dekker to take the back of the house
dekker proceeds inside
after a scan the kitchens clean
conners emerges from the stairway
dekker steps from the back hallway into the darkened living room
eyes straight ahead and sharp
what he doesnt see
conners moves from the hall into the bedroom where he finds
chriss dead body
he checks for a pulse when he notices
on the monitor
conners sees a shadowy figure behind dekker
dekker oblivious to lorenzs presence continues on
heads for the front hallway
lorenz raises his gun narrows his sites on dekker
conners dives tackles dekker behind the living room wall lorenz opens fire unloads a full clip
conners and dekker behind the wall regroup
fires four rounds at lorenz but
lorenz bursts through the back door down the stairs
conners and dekker
dekker and conners emerge from the house
lorenz on the other end of the yard opens fire
the detectives dive for cover
lorenz exits through the fences door
and climbs into a black mercedes benz quickly peels away
dekker and conners bounce up run out the back fence but
as they get there
lorenzs mercedes turns out of the alley and disappears into the night
dekker stares out deflated
police and emergency crews surround the house
an emergency medical technician s attends to dekkers injured shoulder
dekker grimaces from the pain
first day in the city and youve already been shot
it just grazed him
why dont i just graze you with a bullet and see how you feel
your damon richards is awake
handcuffs lock richards to his bed
richards is hooked up to an iv and a tubes up his nose
a heart rate monitor chimes rhythmically
two uniformed officers look on as conners and dekker enter
to the officers take five guys
the officers exit
conners locks the door walks to the bed leans over richards
how you feeling
taps conners may i
conners concedes the floor
dekker addresses richards
you remember me dont you
damon gives an evil glare thought so
dekker turns his attention to richards iv the tubes which carry medication into his body
from a nearby medicine cabinet dekker rummages around
i was skiing about three years ago
i hit a mogul landed on a sheet of ice and slammed into a tree
broke myself up pretty bad
kinda like you did today
i was in a hospital bed for three months
had it not been for
here it is
he finds morphine
without this stuff i wouldnt have made it
dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle
now this iv drip administers a small dosage every minute
makes you feel relaxed and calm
dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the iv bag
if i were to inject this whole thing
that would be all she wrote for damon
you dont have the balls
dekker presses down on the syringe just a little but enough to go into the bag
richards cant believe it
this equipment malfunctions all the time
overdoses are quite common
besides i dont think the das going to launch a full scale investigation over a scum like you
richards attempts to signal for a nurse but dekker pulls the call button away
you dont have to tell us a damn thing
plead the fifth
roll the dice
dekker squeezes in some more until
richards gives in signals that hell talk
conners and dekker exit head to their car
you fuckin hypocrite
you give me shit for my interrogating skills
least i dont threaten them with a lethal overdose
dekker holds the empty vile up hands it to conners
theres never been a single case in recorded medical history of someone overdosing on milliliters of saline
conners checks the label smiles
bend not break
thats what you said right
lorenz aka scott curtis enters his car
lorenzs true identity is scott curtis
hes wanted in connection to three other bank robberies extorsion and kidnapping
jenkins stands before conners dekker teddy vincent and two new detectives det
tommy branch s and det
jerome knight s
hes also the brother of john curtis the perp conners shot at pearl street bridge
moving on richards testifies that he was hired by curtis to pull the bank job with a dirty cop on the inside bernie callo
curtis hoped that conners would take the fall for american national turning ugly disgracing him even further
we also have the names of two more accomplices lamar galt and xander harrington
everyone was set to meet tonight at ten and we have that address
beat after finding callo and lei dead today jenkins contd it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know curtis is eliminating his accomplices
doesnt matter what curtis told galt and harrington hes going to finish them off tonight
conners drives dekker shotgun
conners more intense than normal
you never think of the repercussions
the suspects mother father
how your decision affects them
beat he had murder in his eyes
it was pouring
if he had only done what i said
conners rain pounding down aims his gun mouths the drop the weapon
john curtis the kidnapper on the bridge aims his gun but it was not to be
my father died when i was twelve
he walked into a liquor store in the middle of a stick up
guy just opened fire
never even had time to react
they said he was a hero
know what dekker contd that means to a twelve year old
beat because he died on the job hes a hero
never made sense to me
so why become a cop
finish what he started
every day he went out trying to do some good
help the people who couldnt help themselves just giveem a chance is what he always said
didnt always work out right but he tried
you tried to help save that girl on the bridge
if you werent there the girl still wouldve died
she had a chance because you were there
thats all we can do
a two story house sits on a quiet corner in a quaint neighborhood
crickets chirp break the silence of the night
two cars sit in a gravel driveway
through the open windows
two men lamar galt s and xander harrington s sit in silence
their patience thinning
in the shadows
in various hiding spots
conners and dekker look out at the house
branch looks at his watch then to det
frustrated into radio its twenty five after
how much longer we wait
into radio we go now all we get is galt and harrington
we want curtis
now relax and keep the line free
conners contd to dekker this pricks driving me crazy
conners digs into his pocket realizes
im out of gum
over radio heads up
a brown chevy drives past the house but keeps going
galt and harrington react the same to the car driving by
harrington checks his watch barks at galt
heads for his car
teddy and vincent watch
into her radio conners we got a problem
into radio we hold
no one move
into radio we cant let him walk
we have to go now
into radio no
into radio were going to loseem conners
into radio no
harrington curses at galt who stands on the front porch
harrington waits while galt he makes a cellphone call
into radio we bust them now we got something
but if they get in that car we dont have jack squat
we have three cars here and uniformed backup in all directions if they ride well get them
i want curtis
we dont go in that house until i say
galt hangs up
harrington unlocks his car door
harringtons the first to hear it
in the dead silence everyone soon does
just as teddys able to silence it
harrington spots her car doesnt think twice just starts firing
his bullets keep vincent and teddy pinned down
knight hurries out of the car
harrington sees this fires
the bullet strikes knight in the neck
the bullet rips into harringtons arm
hes hit but not down
he and galt duck back inside the house
branch takes a bullet in the leg
he goes down
trigger happy sons of bitches
conners dekker vincent teddy converge on the house
we take them alive
into radio all units all units
requesting backup immediately
they all rush inside
conners and dekker make their way up the stairs
teddy and vincent head down the hall
conners and dekker move carefully
conners points for dekker to go in the other direction
dekker obeys slides down the other side of the hall
teddys on her toes
she smells something but keeps moving
on the floor
a trail of blood leads to the dining room
teddy signals to vincent
conners enters checks it out
dekker stands outside the closet
he opens it quickly but its empty
on the far wall hundreds of pictures of conners
the same shrine we saw lorenz in front of earlier
vincent swings in from one entrance teddy the other
she takes a cautious step out when
harrington from the corner takes aim again
vincent drops to the floor aims through the dining room table legs and fires
the bullet tears into harringtons shin
he screams in pain conners hears the shots runs out of the room
so does dekker
teddy moves in on harrington
drop the gun
harrington holds his gun up and out towards teddy
is he aiming or surrendering
drop it now
but he doesnt
teddy puts a hole in harringtons chest
he slumps down dead
conners and dekker meet by the top of the stairs
vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs
we got one down
dekker and conners share a look disappointed
but then something catches connerss eye
a door opens
lamar galt aims his conners pushes dekker out of the way just in the nick of time
dekker tumbles down the stairs
vincent breaks his fall
galt fires at conners until hes out of bullets
he ducks back behind a door
but did he hit anyone
dekker grabs his head in pain but okay
teddy leans against the wall spots a vent
a flash goes conners creeps inside the partially open doorway
its quiet until
lamar galt lunges tackles conners
his gun flies from his hands
teddys eyes fall to
on the floor
next to the base of the door is a fuse
it runs from the wall into the vent
she follows it into the kitchen
loud get out of here
get out of here now
vincent and dekker get up
dekker looks upstairs
conners and galt struggle
conners punches galt sends him back
he then slams galt against the wall galt knees conners in the gut
galt goes for the gun conners kicks out his legs from underneath him
but before conners can get the upper hand galt fights back
the two continue
the fuse comes out of the vent
hear the gas emission
teddy rushes from the house
everyone get down
the explosion knocks conners and galt off their feet
conners hits the floor hard
galts head slams against the toilet
teddy watches as
a couple of uniformed cops race to vincent and dekker drag them away
conners leans over galt a giant gash across his forehead feels for a pulse
conners looks into the hallway sees the fire
dekker looks around
dekker and teddy look to the house when
dekker gets up watches the flames consume the house
teddy runs towards the house when
dekker stops her
no we have to go save him
we have to
they both stare at the house
dekker holds her shes a mess
lorenz aka scott curtis watches through a pair of binoculars
no emotion evident
fire trucks police cars and emergency vehicles surround the house
the lights flash an eerie red across the scene
firemen try to extinguish the flames
several news trucks have arrived always after the story
a coroner s zips shut a body bag
inside the badly burnt body of detective conners
the badge on his belt still visible
they load him into the truck
teddy her face drained of life stares at the truck
a fireman walks behind them back towards the fire truck
jenkins huddles with a group of detectives
if it had to be someone
teddy and dekker overhear this
to jenkins you sonofabitch
youve always been jealous of him
its because he wasnt only a better cop
he was a better man
teddy really wants to explode but doesnt
she walks away
jenkins digests what she said then his eyes find dekker
you have something you want to say
she said it perfectly
karen cross finds teddy has her cameraman focus in on her
detective galloway could you give us a comment
teddy looks straight into the camera but cant say a thing
thats when dekker grabs the camera pushes it out of her face
we just wanted a statement
shame on you
this is more than just news for us
american nationals cfo sits on the board of channel two
they have a vested interest in whats going on
find another source
karen and her cameraman leave teddy and dekker alone
conners was right
we shouldve never gone in
how many more mistakes can we make in one day
he was eliminating his accomplices
we thought he was going to show up
we didnt even think he could do this
how dumb are we
quiet mostly dark
a few fluorescent lights and a desk lamp
dekker sits at conners desk
a somber moment reflecting on the man his career
he shuts off the lamp heads for the door
dekker turns to find
dax cradling a page document
i know what they were doing inside the bank
dax flips through the huge document
these are todays transaction records from the bank
an average day produces about pages give or take
today there were over pages
weve just witnessed the largest heist in history
somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars
its a computer virus
the computer virus
it randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys account
if you check the transactions no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none ofem are over
most security systems work on the size of the money not number of transactions
wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up
wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts no flags
wheres the money now
i tried following one of the transactions
it took me an hour and when i finally had it
it went away
how is that possible
the virus created a host of phantom accounts where the money goes dax contd temporarily then transfers to another account then to another
its never in one place long enough to get an accurate fix
its still moving the money around
any deposit or withdrawal from any bank doesnt usually go into affect until the next business day
so its going to keep jumping around until it clears at am tomorrow
realizes or am pacific time
so why break in
if theyre just wiring money
couldnt they do that from anywhere
thats the regional managers computer terminal
theres no outside remote access to it
there you have unlimited entry to the banks mainframe
no passwords to work around no hacking in
its all nice and clean
a billion dollars is missing and were only discovering this now
ironically when the power went out it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work
so they werent trying to make it look like they were robbing a bank to rip off a saudi prince
they were making it look like they ripped off a saudi prince to rob a bank
realizes the chaos theory
dekker shuffles to his car his cellphone rings
detective dekker theres a call for you
says its urgent
put it through
good evening detective
i just wanted to compliment you on a fine day
you were an unexpected adversary that was most challenging
its not over yet
my wish is to catch you
youre a murderer
a cop killer at that
i didnt kill anyone who didnt deserve it
callo was insignificant and conners crossed me
in years to come youll thank me for getting rid of him before he corrupted you
i know about the money
you steal a billion dollars
they will find you
a risk im willing to take
its almost sunrise
fare thee well
lorenz hangs up
dekker surprisingly calm hangs up the phone heads back inside the station
dekker at his desk piles through mounds of paperwork
not sure what to look for he goes through everything
his notes from the bank
the file on galt harrington chris lei
he even digs through conners and finally
jenkins heads for the exit
youre still here
in complete work mode callos insignificant
thats what he said callos insignificant
but he wasnt
what are you talking about
he called you
he said he didnt kill anyone who didnt deserve it
he said callo was insignificant
but without callo he wouldnt have had the knowledge of our department and
grabs a clipboard he wouldnt have had the front money to hire the crew
he was screwing with your head
go home shane
you did good today
your dad would be proud
get some sleep
there will be more bad guys tomorrow
dekker falls back into his chair
the property room sign out sheet
harry hume the evidence room cop out of uniform walks inside sits across from
dekker already here with two different files available to him
i was in bed already
this couldnt wait til morning
cold how did he come at you harry
its the only thing that doesnt make sense
what are you talking about
all day long we thought callo was the dirty cop
all day long we were wrong
dekker slides some papers in front of harry
thats the sign out sheet from the evidence room
heres one of callos reports
heres another one
and another the signatures are different but harry doesnt even examine them
theyre not the same signature harry
theyre not even close
shrugs it off maybe he had a cramp in his hand
i dont know
re file this is your file
you were reprimanded a month ago after you confronted callo at the courthouse
you punched him
that ring a bell
and id do it again
cops who testify against cops shouldnt be breathing the same air i do
theres a line you dont cross
so you set him up
you forged callos signature you gave him the money and you helped him with his plan because you thought he got a raw deal at pearl street bridge
dont deny it harry cause i know
images flash before our eyes
the rain pours down
an suv crashes into a stalled out john curtis the kidnapper crawls out of the suv
he sees cops lights approaching
he drags lisa reann the victim out of the truck
a bright light from a helicopter strikes john in the eyes
its all very blinding
cops block both sides of the bridge
tv reporters at either john holds the gun up to lisas head as
over johns lisa struggles tears streaming down her face
john drops lifeless to the pavement
harry pounds the table
youre helping a cop killer harry
youre a year from pension
this is how you want to go out
my conscience is clean
this has been a very long trying day
and im tired
were chasing a dekker contd phantom
just when we have him
hes been two steps ahead of conners and me all day
of course he has
who knows conners better than him
how the hell does curtis know conners better than anyone
harry goes silent
realizes he just let the cat out of the bag
realizes were not talking about curtis are we harry
still no response who would know conners better than anyone
who would you protect
and who in your mind got the raw deal at pearl street bridge
now resume action
conners and york aim their guns at
john holds lisa tight
drop the weapon
let the girl go
john pushes the barrel of the gun tighter into lisas temple
that you dont want to do
york narrows his aim on john curtis
one step closer and the girl dies
think about this
you kill her where are you going to
york fires just as lisa struggles moves
the bullet intended for john curtis hits lisa kills her instantly
lisas body crumples to the ground
conners and york look on in horror knowing yorks bullet felled an innocent
john turns to fire on the detectives
conners fires kills john curtis
johns body hits pavement
rain pours down
dekker puts it together
it was york who was the bad cop
he assumed scott curtiss identity to throw us off the trail
dax and teddy are speechless
york plays his old partner knowing all his moves frames his enemy for the crime kills him too and pulls off the biggest robbery in history
do what you want to me
he called to tell me he was going and hes gone and you aint never going to find him
dax and dekker gather at daxs desk
dax is on the phone
the number york used to call harry hume is a cellphone number
ran it through dax contd local service providers
nextel got a match
can they get a location on him
that particular phone hes using is equipped with the latest gps technology
should be able to trace his location within meters or less
into phone yeah
to dekker they got him
dekker and dax examine a map
the signals coming from around th street
thats about fifteen miles north of us
deflated from the harbor he can take a boat or a sea plane out
beat thinks no
if theres a signal
means hes still here
hes waiting for something or someone
aint nothing down there thats open at this hour
thinks th street
theres is one place
dekker runs to his car and as he gets there teddys waiting for him
im going with you
w a steel glare its not a request
a beautiful bright full moon hangs in the dark sky
dozens of commercial liners cargo ships and seaplanes line the piers
open twenty four hours a day days a year
a handful of cars occupy the spaces out front
including the mercedes
a scattering of patrons some at the counter some in booths
a pretty waitress s rings up a bill
york aka lorenz curtis hands the cashier a twenty
keep the change
a bus boy carries some garbage out the back
york heads for the exits opens the door and
steps york hoofs two steps outside when
a bright spotlight strikes yorks face
he shields his eyes
behind the lights
dekker and teddy aim their pistols
this is the police
put your hands in the air and slowly get on your knees
york raises his hands high takes a small step backwards
get down on the pavement
york takes another tiny back step
york bends down to one knee draws a mm
to teddy take the back
dekker enters surveys the restaurant
dekker approaches the kitchen door pushes it open and
dekker spins out of the way
as gunfire stops dekker kicks through the door
leans in gun first
in the center of the room
york neck holds the pretty waitress gun to her head
dekker moves in
was it harry
it was harry right
that fat fuck
let the girl go
yorks eyes blaze with activity
easy for you to say
im a plane ride away from a kings ransom
through a side door
teddy slides in unnoticed
drop the weapon let the girl go
and spend the rest of my days in a cage
let me ponder
beat dont think so
if youre going to stop me
im gonna make you earn it
that you dont want to do
realizes thats exactly what i said to him
do you see the irony here
am i the only one
two months ago i was in your shoes
some punk holding a gun to an innocent girl
what should you do
beat a glint sparkles in his eyes
his teeth grind
his gun grip teddy moves into position from the side
the bus boy enters from the same door teddy came in
the door bangs closed behind him
york spins fires in that direction
the bus boy retreats out the side door
dekker ducks away safely
york drags the pretty waitress to the back
dekker runs over checks on teddy
go get him
dekker looks her in the eyes then darts away
dekker exits the back
finds the pretty waitress
which way did he go
down towards the pier
york sprints across the street
hundreds of giant steel cargo containers litter the yard
makes the place look and feel like a giant maze
york disappears into the steel maze
dekker enters slows to a walk
carefully proceeds forward
second guessing each turn
youve really screwed yourself
jenkins is going to expect these kind of results from you everyday
fbis got a team of computer technicians figuring out leis virus
theyll break it
dekker rounds a corner
your conviction would be admirable if it wasnt just so sad
at the far end of the container york fires
dekker ducks back
york takes a look out doesnt see dekker
get it through your head
the calvary aint coming
no heroes are coming to save the day
the bad guy gets away at the end of this story
dekker peers around the corner
but ill give you credit
you turned out to be quite the little thorn didnt you
dekker speed walks continuing the search
i think conners would be sorry that you died
but not me
dekker stops eyes a full
the containers all look alike
dekker wonders if hes just going around in circles
bullets ricochet all around dekker
he dive rolls for cover as
on top of a container
york unleashes until
out of ammo
dekker hearing this pops up returns fire
york leaps off the backside of the container
dekker gives chase
as he circles the container
instead he finds a dock
a narrow wooden dock
theres a few small boats a tug boat and at the end
dekker approaches the tug
each step slow and deliberate
eyes transfixed on the seaplane
as he nears the seaplane
a shadow rises from behind him
from on top of the tug boat
dekker turns just as
york throws a fishing net on top of dekker
as dekker struggles in the net his gun discharges
york with a pike pole in hand leaps down clubbing dekker over the head with the weapon
dekker goes down
dekkers gun slides off the dock into the water
york charges dekker with the pike pole ready to stab when
at the last second
dekker rolls away
the pike pole breaks a wooden plank to pieces sticks into the ground beneath the water
dekker still tangled in the net kicks out yorks legs
he falls to the planks
york quickly rebounds
he pounces on dekker from behind he wraps his arm around dekkers throat choking him
dekker struggles to breathe
york squeezes harder
i have come this far
i will not be denied
dekker fights arms flailing
he reaches blindly behind york grabs a hold of the pike pole
the pole snaps in two
dekker wildly swings at york who dodges easily
york slams dekker into the side of the tug
dekker on his last gasp pushes off the tug
york stumbles backwards gets his foot caught in the hole
he twists spinning around falling down onto
the remaining pike spear
the pike punches through his chest
pops out his back
york blood and life escaping him his eyes find dekker
then go dead
dekker steps close
holds a cold remorseless stare at yorks body
lights flash from the ambulances and police cars
a helicopter hovers overhead
karen cross interviews jenkins
teddy arm in sling and dekker sip on some already cold coffee
we used to spend all day sunday just reading in bed
i would read the paper and he would read one of his billion books
i didnt deserve him
i knew that
but i still loved him
teddy stares out the window
pov of teddy jenkins speaks to karen cross
hes the only man i ever loved
beat did we all get shot today
they cant help but laugh
they said in the city id be busy
every day like this
i wonder whats next
a long vacation
teddy excuses herself to the bathroom
dekker goes to pay the check
at the cashier
dekker reaches for his wallet opens it
do you think im going to charge you after all that
dekker notices the tip jar by the register
he removes a ten dollar bill about to stuff it in the jar
thats when the smell hits him
a strange but familiar odor comes from dekkers wallet or more accurately
the ten dollar bill
but what is it
marnie explains to dekker and conners
do you smell that
smells the bills grimaces what is it
when evidence is taken in any physical mark might effect the ability to lift prints so to mark it we spray it with a scented solution
off of conners look
dekker realizes its the same smell but how did this ten get in his wallet
conners and dekker get to know one another
the waitress lays down the check
anything else officers
conners drops a ten dollar bill on the table
dekker scoops up connerss ten puts it in his wallet and drops a twenty down on the table
dekker a million thoughts spiral at once runs from the diner
teddy exits the ladies room but dekker is gone
papers and books litter the floor
dekker trashes the place looking for a clue of any kind
he rifles through the bookshelves cabinets
all to no avail
thats when he finds
a medium sized paperback dog eared and worn
the title of the book
chaos by james gleick
dekker flips through the book
pages are marked high lighted
key words we find include edward lorenz chaos dekker holds the chaos book in his hand paces
into phone you tried them all
nothing for conners or lorenz
i dont know
no maybe hes not on a flight
dekker then notices the book
the authors name
but try gleick
early morning travellers converge
dekker scans the line up of people
a man s in disguise brown wig spies dekker
he picks up a cellphone dials
dekkers cellphone rings
he quickly picks it up
theres a passage in the surangama sutra which roughly translated means things are not what they appear to be nor are they otherwise
dekker again scans the line hes not there
he scans all the faces again but still nothing
think about that a minute
doesnt that blow your mind
beat what gave me away
at the diner
well to err is human
dekker spots a man on a cellphone he runs up to him spins him around but
its not conners
was it harry that gave him up
harry and the phone call
he called me said callo was insignificant
threw up a red flag
that wasnt him
that was my mistake
i called you
conners on his phone with attached voice modulater
i didnt kill anyone who didnt deserve it
dekker at his car
on the phone listens
but on this ends it sounds like
callo was insignificant
york always thought the plan was flawless
he was cocky
i told him you have to leave room for error
you cant always predict how its all going to play out
a random camera catches an image of richards the scent on the money
you were the biggest wrench of the day
the chaos theory
when you got that
i was impressed
all day long we were trying to find out who the inside source was
it was you
the more information you gather from as many sources as possible no matter how unpleasant the methods are the better
and while id like to take sole credit it was a team effort
beat teddys pretty devastated about your death
shell get over it
conners pushes dekker out of the way just in the nick of time
dekker tumbles down the stairs
vincent breaks his fall
conners fires towards the door
conners takes out a small remote detonator
pushes the first on the floor
next to the base of the door is a fuse
it runs from the wall into the vent
teddy follows it into the gas
get out of here
get out of here the fuse comes out of the vent
hear the gas emission
conners leans over galt a giant gash across his head feels for a pulse
conners looks into the hallway conners gets up and reaches into the bathtub drags out
a corpse hooks his badge onto the corpses belt and lays him on the floor
conners quickly opens a laundry shoot shimmies inside and conners lands safely on a mattress he left on the floor
once settled he pushes the second button on the detonator and
conners opens a trunk inside is a firemans rain coat in the aftermath of the fire
several fireman police reporters etc
are on scene
dekker and teddy dont see
a fireman passes behind them turns his head slightly reveal through the visor its dekker continues his search for conners all to no avail
he turns his back just as
a man walks right past dekker so the corpse in the morgue with your name on its toe
scott curtis wont be bothering anyone again
youre a serial killer
who got killed
harrington galt lei
theyre all hoods
the worlds safer with them gone
the kid at the bank
that was unfortunate
you live with your decisions
you choose to take this road
there is no half way
its all or nothing
thats why others fail
they dont make the commitment
i wont make that same mistake
you said they were all hoods
what about callo
callo deserved his fate
its his fault
this is callos fault
if it werent for him york and i wouldve never done this
one random act causes another causes another and in the end
the pattern emerges
thats the chaos theory
beat its after six
the moneys cleared
im a wealthy man
lei for all his conners contd evil was one smart sonofabitch
the feds will be tracing false leads for weeks
you tanked his trial on purpose
they shouldve suspended me after i testified
what did they expect
and because the bitch that made her career off you worked for channel two thats why american national was the target
everybody who screwed us got screwed
everything in its right place
why not kill me
you had plenty of opportunities
this wasnt about killing shane
this was about standing up for what matters
you kinda grew on me
youre not going to get away
i already have
im not even here now
this is a very valuable lesson for you to learn and its good to have learned it early
you dont always win
all your years of service for not
youre a hypocrite
im an opportunist
i wouldve gladly died in the line of duty but they took that away
if they had been as faithful to me as i to them none of conners vo contd this wouldve happened
the system broke down
good luck detective
it wouldve been an interesting partnership but i have to go now
as dekker continues his search his cellphone cuts off
dekker doesnt notice
the man walks past security and out of the western airlines terminal
conners walks through the small area proceeds out to
conners walks down the aisle finds his seat
good morning sir
ill let the captain know were ready
she hands him a glass of champagne
will there be anything else
no thank you
the private plane takes off
