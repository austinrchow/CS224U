out of sight production draft by scott frank out of sight screenplay by scott frank from the novel by elmore leonard white final blue revised pink revised green revised goldenrod
revised buff revised salmon revised we hear traffic some street noises then
the financial district
lots of people in suits
a shaky spasmodic zoom in finds
jack foley forty big focused expression as he rips a tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter
he starts across the street now peeling off his suitcoat and dropping that too right there on the asphalt as we then
as foley goes inside we then
we then pull back to reveal that were now
as foley stands at a counter holding the above credit application while he studies the bank layout
foley watches a man in a suit carrying an attache case enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced off business area at the front
an executive rises from his desk shakes hands with the man and they both sit down
foley rosses the brochure in the trash then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair
smiling at him is loretta
how can i help you sir
loretta you see that guy talking to your manager has his case open
foley takes out a zippo lighter and casually yet expertly begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank
guindon one of our assistant managers
our manager is mr
schoen but hes not in today
but you see the guy with the attache case
looks again yes
thats my partner
he has a gun in there
and if you dont do exactly what i tell you or you give me any kind of a problem ill look over at my partner and hell shoot your mr
guindon between the eyes
loretta goes stiff swallows stares back at foley
now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds fifties and twenties as you can pack into it
nothing with bank straps or rubber bands
i dont want any dye packs
i dont want any bait money
start with the second drawer and then the one over there under the computer
come on loretta the keys right there next to you
no bills off the bottom of the drawer
as she works first time being robbed
she nods youre doing great
just smile loretta so you wont look like youre being held up
she smiles awkwardly thats the way youre doing fine
we hear a bit of thunder and foley cuts a fast look out the front door
when he turns back he sees that lorettas having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope
here give me the twenties
ill put em in my pocket
okay i havent had to give my partner a sign thats good
now hes gonna wait thirty seconds till after im out the door make sure you havent set off the alarm
if you have hes gonna shoot mr
guindon between the eyes
i think thatll do it
thank you loretta and have a nice day
foley heads for the door
he pauses by mr
guindons desk looks back at loretta
foley smiles at her then turns to the man sitting with mr
guindon indicates loretta
shes cute isnt she
the man looks across the bank at loretta
uh yeah i guess so
foley winks at loretta and walks out
guindon who was that
as foley comes out he calmly walks to a honda civic and gets in
as foley tries to start the car
he tries again
but the car wont start
foley bangs on the wheel
foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open window into foleys ear
i think you flooded it
foley looks to the passenger window where anoter cop smiling now has his gun pointing at him
get outve the car sir
wanna hear a funny story
shut up and get outve the car
and as foley obliges we then
we hear a man grunt
then see foley in slow motion as he jumps through frame now we see a basketball come up in his hand as we realize hes on his way to the
another guy rams into him in mid air knocks him down
a basketball game in progress
all of the men foley included are dressed in blue coveralls and white t shirts
the game is rough
hair is pulled
eyes are poked
a title reads foley is the oldest player here
hes getting tired starts to lose his breath
he finally walks off the court breathing so hard he cant even talk
he simply motions to some young convict to come in and take his place
foley sits down on a bench tries to catch his breath
he looks across the yard to where
sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards
all of them are over sixty
one of them a one legged guy on crutches hops away from the table spits out some tobacco as we
as we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old pal mal and lucky strike packs
another tends to a tomato bush in a tiny patch of garden near the wall
another one sits nearby painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat
foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches his eye
he watches as
both little guys jog past the game slow to a walk then stop and begin stretching out
one of them nods to foley
foley nods back waits for the latin guys to walk off then walks over to a guard pupko pup heavy set dumb as dirt
you want something foley
foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game
some people are going out of here
what if i told you where and when
i expect you to look out for me pup let me run off work details
how many going out
i hear six
looks like tonight
you know who they are
i do but i wont tell you just yet
meet me in the chapel at eight thirty right before lock down
as foley takes his tray up the centre aisle he scans the sea of white t shirts until he sees the two little latins sitting at a table full of
other little latins
chino fifties in shape shovels macaroni in his mouth
chinos wife lulu nineteen looks up from his own neat tray of macaroni and jello and watches foley walk past and sit down with a bunch of bikers
foley watches as the guy across from chino scrapes some macaroni off his plate and on to chinos and chino wolfs that down too
chino steps outside and lights a cigarette
he puts an arm around lulu starts to walk off
todays the day huh
chino looks over watches foley approach lets his arm slip down so he can hook his thumb into lulus belt
the next thing to having him on a leash
i told you man super bowl sunday

chino and lulu exchange looks

foley smiles at lulu who glares back at him

chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard

we wait until super bowl sunday they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine ten days

foley looks off towards the visitors parking area the fence not twenty yards away

where we see someone has written its magic

as marshall sisco fifty slides a small wrapped box across a table
to where karen sisco twenty eight black suit long hair a knockout sits
she picks up the box and shakes it

karen starts to carefully unwrap the present
marshall watches takes a sip of his drink looks around the bar sees how everyones looking at the two of them

she gets up kisses him again
thanks for the gun dad
foley comes in lies down on the bunk
he looks about the cell
all hes got to show for himself
its now quiet on the cellblock
foley closes his eyes and we
a few hundred cons scream encouragement insults as maurice snoopy miller a lanky scary mean looking black man in boxing trunks hits a white guy with a ferocious hook
title reads and then
foley leans in a doorway watching with buddy bragg black foleys age shaved head
the bell sounds and the white guy staggers to his corner as does maurice
glenn michaels surfer look dark shades counts cash in maurices corner whispers something into the fighters ear
ref dont call it pretty soon snoopys gonna send this guy out in a body bag
foley watches a man fifties out of place not as hard looking as those around him
the guy looks nervous can feel the other cons eyes on him as he tries to find a seat
the bell sounds and the white boxer staggers to his feet
maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling
foley turns and watches the fight now
anyone ever tell you why they call him snoopy
buddy shakes his head
maurice dances around the other guy now
he was maurice mad dog miller back when he was pro
now you pet him he goes down
the white guy throws a tired loping roundhouse that barely glances off maurices jaw
sure enough maurice makes a big show out of snapping his head back staggering before he finally goes down
i dont believe it
foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him and anxious now he tries to get out of there
foley and buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as nearby the winning boxer still wearing last nights pummelling on his face gloats to a group of cons
he throws a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning technique
guys braggin he won a thrown fight
foley looks at the other side of the yard where maurice now stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy one hand thrust into his pocket
foley watches as maurice stops the new inmate the older guy who looked out of place at the fights as he comes out into the yard
its richard ripley
looking now the wall street guy
i didnt recognize him without his rug
foley watches as maurice talks to the new inmate the guy nodding acquiescent respectful
dick the ripper they called him on account of all the people he ripped off
foley watches as ripley now makes a note in a black book
whats he doin here
they look to where glenn michaels the blond guy in dark shades we saw in maurices corner works out on the bench press a few feet away
hes shirtless tan in shape
he got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote em a fucking check
like that fifty mil signed his name
struggles with the bar whoa little help here
who you talkin to studs
me or buddy
i cant tell you got those shades on
you guys come on this is too heavy
i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights
ill take the shades off
just get this fuckin thing off me
foley helps him get the bar up
glenn sits up
how do you know he wrote a check
he told me
he works the laundry with me
the guy loves to talk
yeah to the u
i hear he rolled over on all the snitches he was doing business with and got em all brought up
he watches snoopy talking to ripley one eye always on the swaggering boxer across the yard one hand in his pocket
hey anybody that can write a check for fifty mil he says any thing im all fucking ears
like the other day he tells me how hes got all this money in foreign banks plus around five mil in uncut diamonds at his house
he said quote where i can put my hands on it anytime
wheres the guy live
foley watches a few more of maurices friends surround ripley
again ripley takes out his black book starts nodding making notations
snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash
ever seen an uncut diamond studs
they look like plain old rocks
whats your point
my point is thats probably what youre gonna end up with
you think hes lying
use your head
the guys got five million lying around his house you really think hes gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it
a bell sounds
everyone starts walking for the gate
foley watches as the boxer and his crew head for the gate maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket
slow motion as the boxer gets to the gate sees maurice who moves to him now smiling like hes so glad to see him
his left hand clapping the guy on the back saying something like congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket and we see the long metal shiv
watching snoopy here it comes
maurice wraps his left arm around the boxers shoulder and hugs him tight for a moment then quickly moves away
the boxer stands there like a statue doesnt move until hes at last jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement
i guess the snoop doesnt like to lose even if its on purpose
we hear a whistle blow as a guard spots the body
and now everyone moves like hell for the gate
richard ripley who stands there frozen staring down at the body
foley glances back at the approaching guards casually takes ripley by the arm as he passes leads him away from there talks to him as they walk into the block
you dont wanna be standing there the hacks start asking questions you dont wanna answer
oh uh right thanks
foley then moves away
he sees maurice looking back at him giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd
he lies there another moment when
a pairof legs swings down over the side from the top bunk
foleys cellmate jumps down walks the three feet or so to the toilet casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the bathroom
foley shakes his head and turns away
as buddy walks up to a cadillac sedan deville concours pulling a slim jim from the back of his pants about to jimmy the door when he sees
a woman middle aged wearing pearls and high heels come out of the winn dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries
buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants waits until the woman is opening her trunk before coming forward
here lemme help you with those maam
she doesnt seem too sure about it but lets him load the groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock
i didnt ask for your help so dont expect a tip
buddy smiles waves her off
thats okay maam
ill just take your car
she stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off
in the midst of a remodel
as door opens and pup comes in
foley puts a finger to his lips
theyre right underneath you pup
they dug a tunnel
foley watches pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the chapel eyes on the floor listening
i dont hear em
wheres the tunnel come out
pup turns his back walks up the aisle and across the front of the pews to a window
second fence post from the tower out there
go on take a look
as pup stares out the window
i dont see nothing there
foley reaches down into a pew wheres stashed a four foot crucifix
he picks it up starts up the aisle
you will directly
as the high beams from her car show the prison parking area then the fence strung with razor wire
karen parks near the fence lights a cigarette and dials her car phone
karen sisco again for ray nicolet
beat hes not
could you tell him that
ill call back
headlights hit karens rear view mirror a car pulling in behind her
the lights go off then come on again
she adjusts the mirror to deflect the glare
as buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field
he sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as karen checks her face out in the rear view
as foley moves up behind pup he lets his jacket fall to the floor holds the crucifix down against his leg
there some car headlights out there
then jesus christ
now he pulls his radio from his belt says into it
man outside the fence
by tower six
responds to radio this is officer pupko
then im looking at him for christs sake
okay now foley raises the metal cross steps in and lays it smack against the side of pups head
drops him clean with one swing bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him
as karen grabs the court papers off the seat opens her car door glances at the fence and pauses as she sees a figure there crouching down
karen turns on her headlights
no not crouched
the guy is coming out of the ground on this side of the fence
head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground
right in front of her
karen leans on the horn holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence chino and lulu look into her headlights poised there for a moment before taking
off into the dark
karen gets out of the car
as buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of rifle reports before the men disappear into the
then buddy sees karen in his headlights whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk
whats she doing
he watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a holstered pistol
but then she throws the pistol in the trunk ducks in there again and comes out this time racking a shotgun
uh oh and now buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and raise the shotgun as we hear a whistle blow in the compound
buddy gets out of the car
as karen puts the shotgun on two more cons both filthy dirty standing by the hole they just crawled out of
get your hands in the air
buddy watches the two cons both latins make up their minds start edging away shit theyve come this far
they look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark then look the other way along the fence towards the main gate to see armed hacks coming out on
the run and that decides it for the cons
they take off running
now buddy watches as karen puts her pump gun on them but doesnt fire
the hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run
the hacks glance at karen but dont bother with her more interested in the hole the convicts had come out of
now theyre standing by it peering in edging closer with their weapons ready then they all step back at once bump into each other as
a head appears wearing a guards baseball cap the guy now saying something to the guards his face smeared with muck excited pointing towards the orange grove
they run off pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if theyre alive then keep going
the man in the hole foley climbs out
he takes his time puts on a show standing with his hands on his hips like an honest to god hack that serious cap down on his eyes
buddy waves to foley to come on and karen turns and puts the shotgun on buddy
buddy raises the palm of his hand
its okay honey were good guys
whatre you doing here
not so much asking but putting it to him the way cops do when theyre already pretty sure what youre doing
she glances around to include foley now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp giving buddy time to take her around the neck
she fights him jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before foley wrenches it from her grip
they drag her to the rear end of her car the trunk lid still up and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence past the dark gun
tower and cross the road towards the orange grove
a moment later they hear bursts of gunfire then silence
i bet thats all the hacks they send out
otherwise nobodys left to mind the store
why dont we talk about it later
he turns to see foley and karen staring at each other in the headlights from buddys car karen not at all afraid
why youre just a girl
what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun
im a federal marshal and youre under arrest both of you guys
foley keeps staring at her like hes giving the situation serious thought but what he says is
i bet i smell dont i
then listen you hop in the trunk and well get out of here
karen looks at him then gets up climbs into the trunk
shes reaching around trying to find her pistol when
foley gives her a shove and gets in with her wedging her against the wall of the trunk pressing against her back like theyre cuddled up in bed
he holds her to him giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face
buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes
total darkness not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing
then we hear the engine come to life the car moving along
if i could have a little more room
there isnt any
all this shit you got in here
what is all this stuff anyway
whats this can
for your breath
you could use it
squirt some in your mouth
you devil its mace huh
whatve you got here a billy
use it on poor unfortunate offenders
a beam of light appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it on
he plays the beam along karens leg calms down some as he looks at all of her now and finally says
wheres your gun your pistol
in my bag in the car
they go over some bumps
we hear mens voices from somewhere far off outside
you know you dont have a chance of making it
guards are out here already theyll stop the car
he runs his hand down her thigh looking for her gun but also just well looking
theyre off in the cane by now chasing cubans
i timed it to slip between the cracks you might say
as buddy floors it away from the prison checks the rearview mirror
as jack tries to wipe some of the mud off his face
boy it stunk in there
i believe it
youve ruined a nine hundred dollar suit my dad gave me
yeah went real nice with that twelve gauge too
then tell me why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me
guys like me huh
well listen even though ive been celibate lately im not gonna force myself on you
ive never done that in my life
you wouldnt have time anyway
we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to
if they get set up in time which i doubt
and even if they do theyll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas not a big black guy driving a ford
must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this
then picking up speed as the road smooths out
hes a good guy
back when we jailed together hed call his sister every week without fail
shes a born again christian does bookkeeping for a televangelist
buddy calls her up confesses his sins tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob
thats his given name
woops beat one i gave him yeah
as buddy rifles through karens bag while he drives
he looks up from her badge and id case at the road
so whats your name
itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway
youve probably heard of me
why are you famous
time i was convicted in california
fbi told me id robbed more banks than anyone in the computer
how many was that
tell you the truth i dont know
i started when i was eighteen driving for my uncle cully and his partner gus
they go into a bank this one time in slidell gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg
all three of us ended up in angola
i thought so too
it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor
i believe you would have
another fall i did seven years at lompoc
and i dont mean the place next door where some of nixons people went
i know the difference
you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary
ive delivered people there
so basically youve spent half your life in prison
if i go back now i do a full thirty years no time off
can you imagine looking at that
i dont have to
i dont rob banks
he looks at her then looks away as we
as the car turns into a main highway now
as foley plays the light down the length of her
you dont seem all that scared
of course i am
you dont act like it
what do you want me to do
i dont think it would help much
then im just gonna sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up
jesus you sound like my ex wife
you were married
all those falls im surprised you had time
it was just a year give or take a few days
i mean its not like we didnt get along or anything
we had fun we just didnt have that
that thing you know
that spark you know what i mean
you gotta have that
thinking uh huh
we still talk though
as buddy passes a sign that says miami miles
as she tries to get a look at him
you know this isnt gonna end well these things never do
yeah well if it turns out i get shot like a dog itll be in the street not off a goddamn fence
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow
and for a few moments all we hear is the sound of the car on the road
oh you mean of bonnie and clyde
you ever see pictures of him the way he wore his hat
you could tell he had that dont give a shit air about him
i dont recall his hat but ive seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers
did you know he didnt have his shoes on
is that right
they put a hundred and eighty seven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving
bonnie was eating a sandwich
youre full of interesting facts arent you
it was may near gibsland louisiana
a moment later the car flies past
that part in the movie where they get shot
warren beatty and
i cant think of her name
yeah i liked her in that movie about network yeah she was good
and the guy saying he wasnt gonna take any more shit from anybody
anyway that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot
i remember thinking at the time it wouldnt be a bad way to go if you have to
bleeding on a country road
it wasnt pretty after no but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you wouldnt have known what hit you
we hear faint sirens os
as buddy sees flashing lights approach from the opposite direction
he stays cool as the green and whites get closer
then fly right on past
as the sirens scream at us for a moment then fade
youre sure easy to talk to
i wonder say we met under different circumstances and got to talking say you were in a bar and i came up to you i wonder what would happen
i mean if you didnt know who i was
youd probably tell me
im just saying i think if we met under different circumstances
you have to be kidding
foley tries to get back to where it was working
another one faye dunaway was in i liked three days of the condor with robert redford when he was young
they lie there a moment think about that as we hear the car slowing down coasting then bumping along the shoulder of the road to a stop
i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick
i mean romantically
then well but if the trunk goes dark again as the cars turned off
you still alive in there
and the trunk lid raises so that we see karen and foley lying in the back
foley gets out
karen doesnt move
where in the hell are we
thats the turnpike up there
glenns waiting with the other car
okay honey come on out of there
karen pushes off rolls from her right side to her left brings up her sig sauer in both hands to put it on them both standing in the opening in
the dark but right there
get your hands up and turn around
foley brings the lid down he and buddy moving in opposite directions as she begins firing from the inside
as buddy and foley hook up again in front of the car
we can see theyre beneath an overpass
foley stares at the trunk
we may as well leave her were leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway whats the difference where
shes coming with us
foley walks to the passenger seat reaches in the window
jesus christ what were you doing in there
get the shotgun
and her purse
id like to know who she is
foley takes her wallet looks at her drivers licence photo
i already looked
her name is karen sisco
like the cisco kid only spelled different s i s c o
a sheriffs green and white goes screaming past and they keep to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment of the overpass
when the road quiets down foley moves to the trunk and bangs on it once with his fist
be a good girl now you hear
now im gonna open the foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot
youre putting holes in your car
he looks up to see buddy holding her shotgun staring at him
he settles down then
were not leaving you
im gonna open the trunk enough for you to throw the gun out
you shoot buddys got your shotgun says hell shoot back if you do and i cant stop him
so its up to you
foley puts his hand out and buddy still looking at him funny gives him the keys
coming from somewhere above them
its me glenn
foley steps out into the open buddy close behind him
they look up to see a figure head and shoulders against the evening sky leaning on the concrete overpass rail
we can see his long blond hair falling beside his face now half concealed behind dark sunglasses
hey jack good to see you man
the fuckre you guys shooting at
foley looks at buddy
do we need him
the green and whites saw us
one of em starts thinking whats that car doing there
ties it to the break and turns around
foley thinks about it then looks up at the overpass again
oh hey studs
we thought you were somebody else
man i havent heard that since lompoc
whats going on
foley shakes his head then walks back to the ford and bangs on the trunk
you coming out
foley sticks the key in the lock as buddy steps up to the trunk and racks the pump on the shotgun
foley leans close to the metal
you hear that
he turns the key and raises the lid
karen bunched in there extends her arm her hand holding the sig sauer by the barrel
you win jack
buddy gives him another funny look
as glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen audi that reads gone to get gas
have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill
glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade move through the scrub
glenn leans against the car flashers blinking
ill send it to you at glades
jesus whatd you crawl through a sewer
take your sunglasses off
i see better with them on
you dont take em off im gonna throw em off the overpass while theyre still on your head
glenn shrugs takes them off and sticks them in his jeans
wait in the car
youre in civilization now man ease up
id like you to go wait in the car
take her with you and put her in back
in the trunk
foley stares at him waiting
glenn motions to karen
i have to do what im told
she walks past foley without looking at him
wait a minute
let me have your raincoat
looks at buddy somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes
i brought em theyre back at glades in the cadillac
you wanted to take her car
you can blame me if you want
i dont mind
he doesnt say anything as glenn takes off the raincoat folds it up then throws it at foleys feet
here you are sir
foley watches as glenn gets his sunglasses out puts them back on and takes karen by the arm
whats wrong with you
karen looks over at foley then ducks her head and gets in the backseat
why you brought glenn into this ill never know
how bout the score was his idea to begin with
gimme a break
fuckin guys got a vacant lot for a head
was you and me figured the whole thing out
buddy watches foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform all of them caked with muck
youre pulling at it
he lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up takes the guard shirt in his two hands and rips it open popping buttons and tearing the shirt
i dont know why but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out
he aint the problem jack
foley looks at him
you wanna pull your head outta your ass and tell me why were bringing her with us
as karen watches glenn get into the car sees him as the dome light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door
he half turns laying his arm along the top of the seats runs his hand through his hair
if he thinks he can talk to me like this
shit i dont even know what i need them for
karen leans forward to have a look sees foley and buddy against the dark foliage
i got a big score lined up up north
they wouldnt even know about it it wasnt for me
i could do it right now myself except its so fucking cold up there in january glenn
his head turns so that we can see his designer shades
you dont remember me do you
beat it couldnt have been out at glades if thats what youre thinking
i was never out there
no thats not what im thinking
he raises his hand strokes his hair away from his face
but youre sure weve met huh
last fall i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse twice
youre glenn michaels
then i never forget anyone ive cuffed and shackled
he doesnt move or say a word staring at her now like hes been turned to stone
lets think for a minute glenn see if we can work this out
he turns away all the way around to look straight ahead
do we have a gun in the car
i remember you now
foleys not going to make it
and if he goes down glenn you go with him
she touches his shoulder and he jumps
look i can understand if you and foley are close
im helping him yeah wait
have you helped him glenn
at this point technically i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive
so you still have a choice
you can help him and risk going down again get cuffed and shackled hope to god you pull a reasonable judge not some hard on
or if you want to play it another way
he turns and looks at her
foley watches a car pass on the highway
you want to take her to my place and get cleaned up
you come out of the bathroom with your after shave on and she goes oh i had you all wrong
i want to talk to her again thats all
see what would happen under you know normal circumstances
youre too late jack
foley doesnt say anything
just takes a deep breath as we hear the car start and they both look over
he wants to get out of here and i dont blame him
they start towards the car
then stop and watch as it takes off tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement
their backs to us they stand there watching the tailights until theyre out of sight down the turnpike neither of them saying a word
we hear squeaky footsteps over
as maurice miller and his man a big black bulk named himey strut purposefully up the hall
they step into
where richard ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big coffee table book called the warm world of tropical fish
ripley looks up as maurice and himey come strolling into the library sit down on either side of a now very anxious ripley
i got your fishies for you
he sets a small ziploc with two tiny fish inside down on the table
reaches for them thank you
pulls them back not so fast dick
off ripleys look starting now theres gonna be an across the board cost a living increase
year ago i come in here on credit card fraud but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day my dunn broadstreet has gone way the
i think its dunn brad street

the point is prices are goin up too
better get your little black book out richard
we got some business to talk about
ripley sighs takes out his black book and opens it
lets start with the fish
they was two grand but now theys three
ripley looks at the two tiny fish in the bag
that bausch lomb saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks
writing well i need that
and that extra pillows gonna be an even three cs
they all look to where
sits at the far end of the table reading a thick manual of some kind
himey gives him a mean stare
foley points to a sign that says quiet please
sign says shut the fuck up
or cant you guys read
beat there a problem foley
foley shuts the big book chiltons auto repair
yeah i got a problem
this is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns
three hundred bucks for a pillow

faux goose down
how much for your company at chow
i watch the mans back
foley shakes his head turns to ripley
youre smart ripley youll tell this guy to fuck off
well i uhhh
first of all if he kills you hes not gonna get any more money out of you
ripley looks at maurice good point
man doesnt have to get killed
he could accidentally fall on something sharp like a shiv
or my dick
ripley turns back to foley now also a good point
you stick anything in this guy snoop they transfer his ass outta here fastern you can throw a fight and you still end up with nothing
ripley nods takes this in
this doesnt concern you foley
why dont you go on out to the yard have yourself a smoke
i dont smoke
slowly rising you heard the man
go on outta here
foley doesnt move just gives the guy a bored once over
himey heres a pro toh jay of mine
hes ranked number thirty two in the federal prison system
looking at himey thirty two outta what twenty
himey bulldozes forward pulling his massive fist back to clock foley in the head when
in one swift motion foley brings his book up in one hand like hes throwing a pie and drives the hefty repair manual into himeys face snapping the big guys
head back sending his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor back first with a loud thud
maurice goes for foley who picks up the chair just as we hear a whistle
they all freeze look to
who nods towards the door
we pan over just as a guard appears takes in the scene as a dazed himey slowly pulls himself up covers his now bleeding nose
whats going on here
oh you know readings funnamental an shit we just excited
clear outta here
the guard exits
maurice and foley are still staring at each other
did we settle the fish thing
looks at foley yeah
its all settled
he pours the water out of the bag and drops the fish into ripleys open hand
maurice then squeezes ripleys hand into a fist crushing the fish
he taps his fist to ripleys
thats how you do it
maurice gives foley a last look starts out of the room with himey
ripley looks at the crushed fish in his hand then at foley
thanks for your help
we hear a phone ring and then
as maurice lies in bed watching a boxing match on television
stick and jab fool
stick and jab
a frisbee whizzes past the television we hear a dog yelp os
watch that shit
maurices girlfriend moselle about thirty sleepy eyed in a green bathrobe picks the frisbee up off the floor as the phone rings away on the bedside table right next to
calls os tuffy
you gonna answer the phone
its not for me
maurice watches as moselle now tries to throw the frisbee to a little wire haired terrier but it just bounces off the dogs head
scoops up the dog moselle the fuck are you doing to my little tuffy
he lovingly nuzzles the dog like its his child
im trainin tuffy so he can be on a kal kan commercial make us some extra money
he looks at her
thats the dumbest thing i heard in my life

she comes over picks up the phone
hands it to maurice for you

an antsy glenn with his shades on talks on the phone
hey son you must be one a them psychic friends

glenn watches as some guy in a suit gets out of a black lincoln town car and jogs to the john

maurice doesnt say a word
oh im here all right
im very here
question is why arent you here
as foley and buddy hurry up the front steps
im just saying she wasnt scared
cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waiting to make her move
buddy opens the door looks at foley
youre just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you
not much in the way of furnishings
foley follows buddy inside watches as he bolts the door
first thing im gonna do is get all this mud off me
foley starts for the bathroom
ive been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months
soak the prison off me
theres some lilac oil you want some a vanilla candle under the sink
theres something about a nice hot bath transforms a person
its not just about opening up your pores know what i mean
theres just something about the heat and the wet thats calming you know
settles me in a way that i really cant articulate
i know exactly what you mean
its just a feeling
beat you know i could go for some wine tonight
theres a store around the corner ill be right back
foley goes into the bathroom
a moment later we hear the bath as buddy leaves the apartment starts down the hall karen steps into frame watches as he disappears down the stairs
gun drawn she then moves towards the apartment
as foley undresses picks up a candle off the sink and smells it
he notices his nude image in the mirror and checks himself out
as karen slips the door
she looks around hears the water she racks the slide on her gun snicks off the safety and starts for the bathroom
suddenly the water is turned off
she stops where she is
she then moves a careful step at a time towards the open doorway
gradually the tub comes into view beginning with foleys feet resting crossed on the other end then the middle of the tub then shes in the doorway looking down at
foley lying there in the tub his eyes closed
karen cuts her eyes down the length of him taking a moment here to check him out long enough for foley to open his eyes and grab her hand the
one holding the gun
they look at each other a moment
he then pulls her down to him and kisses her
she kisses him back
he then pulls her into the tub with him as we now hear
as she opens her eyes
karen bruises on her face lies in bed
her father marshall sits on the chair beside her
you were talking in your sleep
beat whatd i say
we hear a knock at the door
they look to where special agent daniel burdon black forties expensive suit stands in the doorway file in one hand
to marshall daniel burdon fbi
you mind please waiting outside
we have some business to do here
marshall looks at him a moment
then to karen
i need to go to the john anyway
burdon waits for marshall to walk out then sits down
i wanna be on the task force daniel
thats nice of you to offer karen but i got all the help i can use right now
instead lets talk about how you got the bump on your head
indicates file isnt that my report youre holding onto
yes but i want to hear you tell it
starting with when you tried to grab the wheel where was this
coming to the okeechobee exit
and now we see it
going over a hundred miles per hour blowing past cars
take the next exit
what am i supposed to do now glenn take the exit
no way man no fuckin way am i gonna turn myself in
she reaches over and grabs the wheel
the fuck are you doing
he hits the brakes
the car goes off the road down the grade the abutment coming right at us as we go back to
as burdon sets the file down sits back now
the next thing i knew the paramedics were taking me out the car
burdon looks at karen a moment then
theres a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you
buddy is it
and this fella jack foley
i swear the man mustve robbed two hundred banks in his time
he told me he didnt remember how many he robbed
you talked to him
in the trunk yeah
whatd you talk about
different things prison movies
this fella holds you hostage you talk about movies
it was an unusual experience
foley made me think of that fella carl tillman the one you were seeing it turns out the same time he was doing banks
you recall that
when i was seeing carl tillman i didnt know he robbed banks
yeah but i had enough reason to believe he did and i told you
so you had to at least suspect him
and what happened to carl
the time came you shot him
but you didnt shoot foley or the guy with him
theyre unarmed you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk
okay now you got your sig in your hand
you say in the report you couldnt turn around he had you pinned down
but when the trunk opened how come you didnt cap the two guys then
is that what you wouldve done
you say in the report glenn didnt have a gun but you let him get away too
daniel what do you work on most of the time fraud
go after crooked bookkeepers
karen ive been with the bureau fifteen years on all kinds of investigations
have you ever shot a man
how many times have you been primary through the door
i have to qualify is that it
you have to know what youre talking about
we hear chuckling os
burdon glances at the doorway where we see marshall now standing enjoying this
well talk another time karen
id like to know why foley put you in that second car when he didnt need you any more
youll have to ask him
sounds to me like he liked having you around
ill see you karen
marshall waits for him to walk out
the white mans burdon
thats what everybody calls him in miami
the metro dade guys
hes got a knack for pissing people off
shes not listening
he sits down takes her hand
what are you thinking about
the sig sauer you got me for my birthday
tell you what youre a good girl you might get another one for christmas
she looks at him
ill get it back when i get foley
a dozen geriatric residents sit on chairs out front as buddy climbs the steps carrying a bag of groceries under one arm newspaper under the other
an old woman comes out the door as buddy opens it and squints at him
oh are you delivering the oxygen
uh no maam
buddys real apartment not the one karen pictured in her dream
this ones nicer with a view of the beach
jack stands on the balcony going through karens purse
he pulls out her wallet checks out her drivers licence photo
he does the same with her gym i
he finds her address book and opens it up
a photo of her father slips out
jack examines it a moment then flips through the book
he stares at something in her bag a moment then reaches in and comes up with her us marshal i
he slips it open and studies the badge and the picture opposite
he holds on to it looks out at the ocean but really sees
as karen gets out saying
you win jack
foley turns away from the view as buddy walks in sets the grocery bag down on the coffee table
you made the front page
he holds up the newspaper so that foley can see his picture on the front page an unflattering mug shot that doesnt look all that much like him
they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want nobodyll know you
i wasnt feeling my best that day
id just drawn thirty to life
maybe thisll make you feel better
buddy reaches into the bag tosses foley a new zippo
foley catches the lighter immediately begins playing with it
he looks at the paper on the coffee table as buddy sits down pulls some groceries and a sixpack from the bag
paper says theres ten grand each on you chino and lulu
say anything in there about karen sisco
just that she got away
yeah but what happened after she drove off with glenn
youll have to ask glenn
and most likely hes on his way to detroit where we should be
foley walks back out on to the balcony looks at the contents of karens bag spread out on the table
you realize what youre doing
worrying about a person that works in law enforcement
you want to sit down and have cocktails with a girl that tried to shoot you
you hear what im saying
foley holds up the picture of marshall sisco
think this old guy is her boyfriend
its the only picture she carries
am i going to detroit by myself
foley picks up her drivers licence photo
longer we hang around down here jack better chance there is either glenns gonna fuck up the whole score or we gonna get busted or both
well leave first thing in the morning
right on a marina
boats bobbing on the water
is this foley
marshall sits in his chair holding up a newspaper as karen hands him a drink
she stares at the photograph
he doesnt even look like that
no he looks a lot
she realizes marshalls watching her
the doorbell rings
she ignores his look gets up
walks to the door and opens it to reveal ray nicolet boots leather jacket etc
you look great
your dad taking good care of you
he took the week off so wed have time together
so far hes worked on his boat every day
marshall gets up shakes his head
ive heard a lot about you mr
rays with the f
task force working on the prison break
eyeing his t shirt i see that
ray turns to karen holding his jacket open to show the task force inscription on his t shirt in red the guys
tucked into his waistband
in case no one knows what he does
tell me ray you ever wear one says undercover
changing the subject hows it going
we got one of em
karen looks at him
was it foley
before he can answer off a tip
yeah someone spotted two of em in this hobo camp out by the airport called the number i knew it soon as i saw they were offering a reward
she grabs nicolet by the arm
was it foley
marshall looks at her
no it was one of the cubans
we went out there full swat two choppers the whole bit but linares started shooting anyway
we put him down but somehow chirino got away
did you pay the guy the reward
yeah as soon as we got back
foley hadnt been there
her father gives her a look
this place was strictly cuban
if foley had a ride he must have his own agenda
he seems to be the only one knows what hes doing
the phone rings
marshall moves to it
beat yeah she is
just a minute
hands her the phone for you
on the balcony
flipping through a copy of vogue while buddy watches television inside
karen just stands there sees her father looking at her as ray drones on
you know who this is
she walks out to her fathers balcony now
i just wanted to see if youre okay make sure glenn didnt hurt you or you know anything
something ive been wondering ray
marshall picks up the newspaper
it says in the headline i slept with a murderer says shaken miami woman
she lives in little havana her husbands out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her door
she closes the glass door so that they wont hear her
howd you get this number
who was it answered the phone
none of your business
im just worried maybe im not old enough for you
thats my dad
he has a cops face
how do you know
wait you have my wallet
and your gun
think i could have them back
how do we do that
you could come on by my dads place drop em off
ill just leave em with the s
guy answers the door
foley stops flipping through the magazine stares at what hes been looking for an ad for defiance perfume
theres a guy here on the task force right now
maybe i should put him on the phone let you two work it out
you wont do that
because youre having too much fun
she doesnt know what to say to that
foley smells the ad
she fixes him pork chops and rice the next thing you know theyre making love on the sofa
she says he was very gentle
i spoke to her
the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him
thats how you score now
karen looks inside at her father talking with ray nicolet
my dads retired
he was a private investigator
i used to work for him
i can just picture that a cute girl like you following slip and fall and whiplash cheaters
something ive been wondering what ever happened to your uncle cully
you think he might tell you where i am
unless you wanna tell me
he did twenty seven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital i think trying to make up for all the good times hed
then thats not gonna be me
one last score that the idea
move to some island
im partial to mountains myself
but if you like islands well make it an island
whatta you mean well make it an island
i just thought maybe you and me could buddy opens the door sticks his head out startles foley
who you talking to
is that buddy
foleys caught off guard hangs up the phone
he looks at buddy
you better come see this
as karen stands on the balcony another moment then hangs up opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room
the woman also said he stole her husbands gun a twenty two pistol and some of his clothes
so the womans married
she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it
but you dont reveal her name you protect her
it sounds like youre saying its okay as long as her husband doesnt find out about it
like the guy who cheats on his wife saying what she doesnt know wont hurt her
he looks over at her now
gives her an innocent look
as foley and buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at the hobo camp
we catch a glimpse of ray nicolet gun in his foley shakes his head as they show a shot of lulus body covered with a sheet
chinos gonna wanna talk to me
hes running for his life he doesnt give a shit about you
hes gotta know by now that i gave him up back at glades
he does hes gonna try to find me
maybe go see adele see what she knows
he knows where she lives
foley doesnt answer
buddy mutes the set
turns to foley
we were talking one time drinking rum
i mayve mentioned adele how she worked for a magician
chino got interested
hes like yeah
how does he saw the woman in half
he wanted to meet her
or get a look at her if she ever came to visit
so call her up
tell her dont talk to any cubans
her phones probably tapped
and you know theyre gonna have some people watching the hotel
karen stands there with her car keys and purse as marshall paints the trim on the boat
remember pay attention to how she talks about foley her tone
do it right shell tell you things she wouldnt tell burdon
tell her you think hes a nice guy
no first tell her about being in the trunk with him in the dark for half an hour and see how she takes it
if shes in on it what does she get for all the aggravation cops breathing on her
i bet nothing
so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out
you think thats possible
what kind of guy is he
hes pretty laid back confident
he remind you of that guy tillman
not at all
but you know hes dirty and you still wanna see him again
i want to bust his ass put him in shackles
but youre also curious about the man
twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him
you were concerned but you didnt want to show it
my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity
i couldnt believe it
you like the wild ones dont you
tillman nicolet and now foley
you know ive always said theres a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers all those guys that love to pack
foley kid napped me
yeah but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike
it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping
she gives him a look
he goes back to his painting
go talk to the ex wife
as adele comes in drops a stack of her cards on the glass topped dining table and turns on the window air conditioner when the phone rings
she grabs it
hi this is adele speaking
near the beach
chino on the phone
he wears a painters cap and a white jumpsuit
oh is this adele
yes it is
he hangs up glances about then checks the little
stuck in one of his pockets
as he then starts off down the street we can see the name color my world housepainting on the back of the jumpsuit
foley in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit is beside him
buddy looks at him shakes his head
im a tourist
you at least bring the gun
lifts straw bag in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel
points thats her place
as they drive past buddy indicates a man on the steps out front obviously fbi
you see the guy sitting on the porch
the old ladies and one guy
you know theyll have a couple more in a car somewhere
watching something else uh huh
buddy follows foleys gaze to
as a car door opens and karen sisco gets out rifles her purse for change
she drops a quarter foley now watching as she bends down to grab it her skirt hiking way up her thigh
foley watches her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it
okay you saw her
thats all you get
they watch as she walks to the normandie and shows the young agent her id
i guess adeles in good hands
sure looks that way
finally lets go to detroit
now youre talkin
adele has the chain on the door talks to karen through the narrow opening
you were both in the trunk
from glades to the turnpike
then i left with glenn
karen watches adeles face in the opening freshly made up heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss
the fbi didnt tell you i was with them
they didnt tell me anything they asked questions
but you know what im talking about dont you
about glenn dont you and the second car
i know a glenn
she thinks a moment
the door closes and opens again all the way
adele stands there in a robe hanging partly open panties but no bra
im getting ready to go out
you can come in if you want sit down for a minute
would you like a diet coke
she comes in checks out the place
she turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as adele comes out of the kitchenette with a diet coke and packet of cigarettes
those are cute shoes
the kind of jobs i get i have to wear these killer spikes they ruin your feet
she walks away comes back with an ashtray
when you were in the trunk with jack
karen waits watches her light her cigarette
he didnt hurt you or anything did he
you mean did he try to jump me
no but he was kind of talkative
he gets that way when hes nervous sometimes
adele sits down at the other end of the table
you didnt visit him in prison
he didnt want me to
i dont know
he was different after he was sentenced looking at thirty years
said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer
but you spoke to him on the phone
hed call every once in a while
he called the day he escaped
i dont remember
did he say about me
in the trunk
beat lies he said he wished the two of you could start over live a normal life
problem is jacks idea of a normal life is robbing banks
its all hes ever done
did you know that when you married him
he said he was a card player
i could live with that
i never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire if you can imagine something like that happening comes out of the bank and
the cars on fire
i did go see him in jail to tell him i was filing for divorce
he said okay
jacks so easy going
then he was fun but never what youd call a real husband
adele looks out the window
karen waits looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of jack and adele on a boat somewhere ten years back
ill say one thing for jack he was never ugly or mean or drank too much
he was very considerate lights on or off if you know what i mean
looking at the picture hm
she realizes adele is looking at her
adele sooner or later hes gonna get caught
id like to get him before he does something else makes it worse on himself
buddyll take care of him
keep him outve trouble
hes jacks conscience
always has been
chuckles he tell you how they met
karen shakes her head
jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena couldnt get his stolen car to start
battery was dead
he looks over sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville goes up offers him a thousand dollars for a jump
turns out buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing
buddy says ill take the thousand but were leaving in my car not that piece of shit you come in
then they musta robbed fifty banks together
till they got busted
that wasnt jacks fault
no that was on account of buddy for some reason decided to call his sister and confess to a job before theyd done it instead of after
she called the fbi and they both went down ended up at lompoc
then i think buddy felt kinda bad about that
any idea where i could find buddy
adele looks at karen then jumps at the sound of three quick raps on the door
you in there
i want to speak with you please
who is it
i talk to the guy you work for emil
he tole me your number and where you live
see im looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you
you did work for emil right
yeah i was emils box jumper for almost four years
you were his what his box
karen looks at the door
through the glass bricks that line one side of the door we see blurred movement on the other side someone doing something you say you perform in the miami area
yes around here
i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here
manuel the mayishan was my name
and now karen and adele look at each other
can you open the door
karen shakes her head no
im not dressed
listen to me
lowers his voice im a good friend of jack foley
karen gets to her feet brings her bag to the edge of the table sees adele staring at her
ask him his name
who are you
beat jose chirino
karen brings her beretta out of the bag
or maybe you hear jack foley call me chino
im the same person
karen moves along the table to adele
soft tell him to wait in the hall you have to get dressed
say it loud
as adele speaks karen racks the slide on her mm
wait in the hall
i have to get dressed
tell me where is jack foley i dont bother you no more
karen motions for adele to keep talking as she takes a position beside the door where we now see chinos silhouette in one of the three glass panels in the
centre of the door
i dont know where he is
listen im the one help jack escape from prison
he tole me i cant find him to see you
so why dont you open this fucking door
so we can speak
staring at karen go away or ill call the police
why you want to do that to a frien
adele says nothing
okay you dont want to help me im leaving
then im going now
i see you maybe some time okay
low go in the bedroom and suddenly chinos fist wrapped in his shirt explodes through one of the glass panels
adele and karen both jump as chino pushes his arm through reaches for the door knob
but karen grabs the knob first and using all of her weight as leverage pivots and flings the door open with chinos arm still sticking through the glass
the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he bangs against a wall and falls to the floor
dazed chino reaches for his
as he now tries to get to his feet
karen brings up her beretta in two hands cocks it and puts the front sight on his chest
leave it where it is
you not adele
im a federal marshal and youre under arrest
put the gun on the table
i mean now
then this must be adele
he now aims the gun point blank at adele
put it down or ill shoot
you wouldnt shoot me would you
what do you want to bet
beat i could walk out of here
if you move if you look at her again youre dead
chino doesnt move
keeps his gun on adele
karen starts walking towards him
you can live or die its up to you
oh is that right
you going to shoot me
nice girl like you
smiles i dont think so
you dont huh
and with that she kicks him in the knee
chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun
on your knees
he does as hes told
karen raises his jacket feels around his waist from behind
lie face down on the floor
she kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there
she puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone dials
she sees adele staring at her
to adele excuse me
karen looks at adele a moment then says into the phone
daniel burdon please
excuse me adele
you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside

adele looks at karen who shoves chinos head to the floor with her foot
where are you
i been trying to get a hold of you
listen where are you
i been trying to reach you
im at adele delisis
what we already talked to her
thats a dead end
looking at chino yeah i know
i was just leaving
why were you trying to reach me
there was a buddy bragg at lompoc around the same time foley was there
we got an address for him at the adams hotel in hallandale
i want you to go there see if you can get the manager to i
him as the other guy
if he does you call me right away

yes or no daniel
if i get him will you let me go after foley
yeah sure karen
you bring in chirino you can be on the task force
thats all i wanted to know
now forget about the ex wife and get over to the adams hotel
karen hangs up looks at adele
as foley and buddy quickly pack up their stuff
first thing we do we get to detroit we find glenn then we find a window to throw him out of
i been thinkin if i was glenn i was up there to take down the ripper where would i go
well first off if you were glenn you wouldnt be thinking
remember snoopy miller his old pal from lompoc
christ i thought hed be brain dead by now
he isnt fighting no more
glenn told me the snoops been managing some guys up there now works out at the kronk
the ancient residents stop what theyre doing as burdon enters with eight guys in jackets and wool shirts hanging out running shoes half of them carrying what look like athletic
karen meets them as they all walk to the elevator
you get the key
theyre in d
she hands it to him as they wait for the elevator
i want two men outside front and back
conway and jessup go on up to seven cover both ends of the hall
burdon karen and the remaining four swat team agents
burden looks at them one at a time
youre primary youre secondary youre point man
youre gonna use a ram
the managers door is metal
they all look at her
you know what i mean
they might all be
and a ram on a metal door makes an awful lot of noise for what good it does
burdon looks at her not all that happy she spoke up
the fourth man raises the shotgun a three inch strip of metal taped to the muzzle
i got a shock lock round in my shotgun oughta do the trick
he sees the elevator still hasnt come down
lets take the stairs
burdon pauses looks at karen hands her a radio
take the radio stay down here in the lobby watch the elevator
daniel i wanna go upstairs
you can go wait out in the car you want to
she doesnt say anything
now you see foley and this guy bragg come in behind us whatta you do
pissed call and tell you
and you let them come up
you dont try to make the bust yourself
before she can answer an old woman steps in asks burdon
are you delivering the oxygen
burdon looks at her then nods for his men to start up the stairs
everyones in position as burdon eases the key into the lock turns it
the door wont budge a dead bolt holds it shut
the guy with the shotgun puts the strip of metal against the seam where the lock enters the frame the muzzle of the shotgun exactly three inches now from the
dead bolt and looks over his shoulder at burdon
with the sound of the blast we then
as foley and buddy ride down with an old lady
the doors open
the woman doesnt move
is this your floor mother
yes it is
as an old gent in a golf cap smiles at karen sitting there on the couch in front of the elevator
like to play some gin
no thank you
he creeps off towards the elevator
as burdon and his men fan out through the place
as we hear burdons voice
theyre not up here
keep your eyes open
karen looks off towards the street entrance then back at the elevator where the man is still waiting leaning on his cane
the elevator door opens to reveal buddy and foley
buddy and foley dont answer
the old man starts to get on feeling with his cane taking forever
karen and foley are staring at each other
he doesnt move
not until the elevator door begins to close
buddy sees karen helps the old man aboard as
karen picks up her radio is about to speak into it when
foley raises his hand
and waves as the door closes as the elevator resumes going down
shit i wanted to go up
lets just hope theres no one in the garage
she looked right at me
she didnt yell or get excited
she didnt move
as they get in and buddy starts the car
they know where i live i guess they know what i drive so maybe we should pick up another car on the way
she just sat there looking right at me
buddy gives him a look shakes his head and then burns rubber out of the garage as we
staring straight ahead
you see anything
as marshall walks karen to the gate
he waved to you
i couldnt swear to it but im pretty sure he did
you wave back
i didnt have time
i imagine you wouldve though
she shakes her head
buddys sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning called burdon
shes also the one gave burdon buddys address
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in
he doesnt seem to hold a grudge
then what want to know is why they got such a big score up north did foley hang around miami for so long
looks at her any thoughts on that one
none id like to share
she gives him a kiss
ill call soon as i get in
a black lincoln town car creeps through the neighbourhood full of big beautiful snow covered homes
i dont just manage fighters or deal product any more
glenn sunglasses sits in the back with maurice aka snoopy wearing a purple bandanna and his own dark sunglasses
ive diversified since the last time you saw me
ive vertically integrated and now im into home invasions and the occasional grand larceny
glenn just nods stares out the window
white boy bobs my all around man my bodyguard when i feel i need one and my driver
maurice indicates white boy bob a fucking huge depraved looking white guy now squeezed in behind the wheel
watch the road boy
then i like this town car
we can cruise the mans neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass
sure right they see bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna no they wont think anything of it
its lilac man the color and the styles made known by deion and other defensive backs in the pros
i could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players
okay here comes mr
ripleys house up on the left
the brick wall
theres his drive right there
the car creeps past a huge tudor style country house
you sure foley and his pal arent coming up here do this themself
if theyre not busted now theyre gonna be
then its wide open
people on the street with vacant expressions watch as the black town car moves past the broken down homes cars on blocks and snow covered trash
so you still havent said how you wanna do it
ill show you soon as i get one more guy im gonna need moselles brother kenneth
along with white boy there
the car pulls to the kerb and kenneth a wiry black man in a bright yellow t shirt and red baseball cap backward always seems to be high on some
chemical or another gets in
you get everything
kenneth tosses a gym bag into the back seat
glenn stares at it
something about the bag makes him uneasy
maybe its the hacksaw that sticks partially out of the opening
kenneth this is the man i told you about glenn
the one gonna help us rip off the rich guy
help you white boy bob pulls out again
glenn looks at the two psychos in front then turns to maurice
wait a minute
im letting you in on this not all your friends
you just ask me how we gonna do it
thats what im here for tell you how
we the experts
glenn cant believe this is happening
thing im worried about is you

i say i want you to come along on another job see if you for real or not guess what you gonna do
glenn looks at maurice now ice cold behind the shades
glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit looking two story house
maurice opens the gym bag passes the hack saw and a hand axe up to white boy bob a sawed off shotgun to kenneth and takes out a big
lets go see eddie
glenn hesitates then slowly gets out of the car as we hear
must take balls do what you do
as foley walks with ripley across the yard
tell me something
whats it like walk in a bank with a gun stick it up
i dont know
i never used a gun
youd be surprised what all you can get you ask for it the right way
smiles youre the reason jack i dont keep all my money in banks
where do you keep it dick
ripley smiles im talking about all those uncut diamonds you told glenn about
still smiling i know what youre talking about
youre the one with balls dick say something like that to someone like glenn
or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute
yeah but whos gonna believe glenn
i mean do you believe glenn
of course not
plus even it was true hed still have to figure out where i keep em
doesnt have to figure out shit
you told him you keep em at your house
shrugs big smile its a big house
ripley sits down on one of the picnic tables looks around the yard
tell me something jack how much longer you in here
twenty two months three days two hours
i was just thinking that i could use a guy like you someone knows how to ask for things the right way
im talkin about when youre outta here
i mean you cant rob banks for ever
foley looks at ripley
its a little late for me
i didnt make my first million until i was forty two
you really want to change its never too late
i dont know
im not exactly the nine to five type
but then you gotta look at a job as more than just work
you gotta look at it as peace of mind
as security you know what i mean
i got offices in detroit miami boston take your pick
my ex wifes in miami
its nice down there
no need to decide now
be like the fish
let whatever happens happen
yeah fish live in the present
they dont dwell on yesterday and they dont worry about tomorrow
even when a big fish attacks a little fish theres no neurosis involved
no guilt afterward
no whining on some fish shrinks couch
they just do it
i cant say that ive paid that much attention to em before
the fish saved my life
two years ago i found out i had high blood pressure
so my doctor he tells me to go get an aquarium look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out
and the guy sent you a bill for this
you should try it sometime
the next time i walk into a bank
ripley shakes his head then gets up
think about my offer jack
foley watches him go
as he turns to us
across the street from the kronk recreation center a red brick building in a bleak depressing neighbourhood
you see this one
buddy reads from a newspaper while foley watches the gym
fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying
seems this womans live in boyfriend seventy years old complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve gauge
police found noodles in the womans hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him
theyd been together ten years
love is funny
buddy looks at him
notices something over foleys shoulder
hey and now foley turns and looks over as the black town car pulls into the kronk parking lot
kenneth and white boy bob nod along to some rap tape in the front seat
glenn sits in the back looking pale hugging himself shaking
maurice looks out the window
was a time you see a gold mercedes over in the parking lot has a license plate on it say hitman
you know tommy hearns is inside
seeing the car would get our juices flowing
maurice looks at glenn now and grins
you already got your juices flowing huh
pissed your pants back there at eddies house didnt you
glenn just looks at maurice
that was some shit huh
indicates kenneth whyd he have to do that to that girl
yeah kenneth why you have to do that to that poor girl
smiles do what
glenn says nothing just looks at kenneth
just wait till we get inside ripleys house
and he and whiteboy start laughing as they get out of the car
its all right with you ill just hang in the car
you gonna stay close to me from now on
so you dont disappear on me
why would i do that
maurice looks at him starts laughing
white boy bob and kenneth join in
maurice leans over
glenn flinches as maurice opens glenns jacket so that we can see the blood splattered on his t shirt
was worse than you imagined wasnt it
then smiles baby you with the bad boys now
as they watch glenn and snoopy and white boy bob get out of the car
whatta you think
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner
glenn sits on a bench near the rear wall facing the ring
kenneth grabs a magazine walks into the john
a shirtless white boy bob lifts weights while maurice moves around the ring calling to the boxers inside
stick and jab
hey studs how you doing
he looks up sees buddy and foley coming this way
jesus christ whatre you guys doing here
they sit down on either side of him close
werent you expecting us
that broad you picked up did you know she was a us marshal for christ sake
now he turns to buddy as buddy stands up takes off his overcoat and sits down again
she knew me from some bullshit dope bust
she drove me to court
you know what she said were in the car on the turnpike
i never forget anybody ive cuffed and shackled
she said that to you
glenn turns to see foley with a mild expression on his face almost smiling
what happened to your shades
someone finally step on em
touches his head i dont know
foley notices the blood on glenns shirt
whose blood you got all over you
these guys man theyre crazy
looks off shit
foley follows his gaze sees maurice coming this way white boy bob beside him carrying his shirts
is that snoopy
in the purple doo rag
whats he do now tell fortunes
maurice stands at the edge of the ring apron looks from foley to buddy and back again pretty serious about it
we have a problem here

snoopy miller famous fight thrower

white boy bob stares down buddy who couldnt give a shit

nobody backing down

glenn didnt tell you
i thought you guys were busted
just because you left us standing on the side of the road
foley looks at glenn
glenn shrugs laughs nervously
foley smiles laughs with him maybe a little too hard
now maurice starts laughing
white boys lost looking from one guy to the next as foley gets up faces maurice his smile going away as he says
look snoop i dont know what glenn promised you or what you think youre gonna get but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from
how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you
lets go outside and talk

yall want to talk come to the fights tomorrow night well sit down and look at it good
the state theater
foley nods then looks at glenn as buddy gets up
well see you tomorrow then
maurice then watches as they walk out
white boy how much is the reward on the man again
then you recall did it say dead or alive
the same decrepit two storey place maurice et al hit earlier
now its a crime scene
a small crowd of neighbourhood gawkers stand just behind the yellow tape
a huge spotlight lights up the front yard
karen pulls up in her rental car gets out and badges the visibly freezing cop at the tape working crowd control
im looking for ray cruz
pissed with everybody else
karen ducks under the tape and starts up the walk
she pauses to watch as two coroners assistants cover with a sheet a dead black woman who lies just below a broken upstairs window
karen has to step over a body minus a face that lies in the doorway
straight ahead on the stairs is another body a man on his back head down the stairs shotgun blast to the chest
he wears a dress now bunched up around his waist
congealed blood runs down the stairs
cops and crime scene techs are everywhere
karen looks at the guy on the stairs
called themselves the youngboys
karen looks over as raymond cruz a stocky genial looking detective comes out of the kitchen
ironic isnt it
how are you raymond
but im getting warmer
he kisses her on the cheek
she indicates the body by the door
quite a mess
and i thought everyone liked eddie
dude in the dress is eddie solomon used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself
word on the street was he was saving up for an operation
what is it with crack and transsexuals
yeah eddie was a real character
had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes
i saw one of em outside
looks like someone raped her shot her then threw her out the window
shakes his head fuckin animals
this shuts them both up
cruz indicates the door
lets get some air
she starts to follow him out pauses as she sees something on the ground
a lot like the ones she remembers glenn wearing
karen stares at them a moment then walks out
as cruz and karen walk to his car strobes flash as press photographers struggle to shoot the crime scene
other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together
you gonna tell me why youre comin to me instead of the fbi
i report to the fbi first thing theyre gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee
you know im not in homicide any more
no i didnt know that
yeah im crimes against persons and property now also sex crimes and child abuse
detroit you must be pretty busy
yeah and as you can see home invasions are big too
listen raymond a year ago dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but couldnt make it stick
in his statement glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities if you can believe that
who was the friend
guy named maurice miller also known as snoopy a former prizefighter
christ i know snoopy miller
hes a fuckin wackjob thinks hes sugar ray leonard
hangs out with a couple other grade a nutcases over on the west side
ill need a last known address
thats fine but i dont want you to talk to miller alone
come on raymond im a federal officer im armed
he turns and looks at her
yes you are
ill call you tomorrow with the address
as he gets into his car we then the crime scene from the night before
a shot of karen and ray cruz as they exit the house
a headline reads triple murder blah blah blah
you have the paper
foley wearing a suit now no shoes no tie looks at the newspaper photograph of karen
its a terrific shot of her
buddy looking at the same shot
outside of that
doesnt say what shes doing up here but i dont think it has anything to do with us
she came up here on her vacation cause she likes shitty weather
foley reaches in one of the bags from the jewish recycling center and pulls out a tie
i think shes after glenn
the girl still with you
they dont stay the night jack less you pay for it
you tell your sister about it
just hung up
how long you talk to her
how long were you with the girl
forty five minutes
you didnt tell your sister about ripley did you
cause i dont wanna go through that again
forget about my sister
if karen siscos tailing glenn were fucked
tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up
lets drive by where were meeting and have a look
maybe take a look at ripleys place while were at it
foley hangs up
he faces the mirror starts to tie his tie
i guess next time i see you youll be wearing a suit and tie
foley leans in the doorway watching as ripley dressed in a jogging suit and under the watchful eye of a guard gathers up his belongings
hes going home
i still havent made up my mind yet
whats to think about
you goin right back to work
first im goin to israel for a year study the talmud work on a kibbutz
then come back maybe take some tennis lessons
he tears a picture off the wall
hands it to foley something to remember me by
foley stares at the photograph of sea life
its not the real thing but its still nice to look at
foley looks at ripley who extends his hand
see you on the outside jack
foley finishes tying his tie stares into the mirror takes in the overall effect
i just broke outta jail
his smile fades he then sits down heavily on the bed looks at the picture of karen another moment then sets the paper aside grabs the yellow pages flips to
hotels and dials the phone
karen sisco please
pause then im sorry but theres no one by that name registered
he dials the next number
red brick showing its age
karen rings the doorbell and then waits with her hands shoved into the pockets of her dark navy coat
the door opens to reveal moselle in her green silk robe holding her arms close against the cold
what do you want
im looking for maurice
you find him tell him the dog got run over and im out of grocery money
who you talking to
lady looking for maurice
whats she want
thats not maurice
thats kenneth my brother
hes talking on the phone
ask what she want with him
you ask her
maurices business is none of my business
sounding tired or bored
she turns from the door and walks into the living room
karen steps inside pushes the door closed and steps into the foyer
how do i know
karen peers into a study a small room with empty bookcases and sees kenneth in his backward red baseball cap as he talks on the phone
the state huh
karen walks into the living room where moselle sits on the sofa lighting a cigarette
you like to sit down
karen takes a chair and looks around the room dismal gray daylight in the windows dark wood and white stucco the fireplace full of trash plastic cups wrappers a pizza
im looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows
you not with probation one of those
you a lawyer
smiles no im not
maybe you know him
moselle draws on her cigarette blows out a stream of smoke
no i dont know any glenn
he said he stayed here last november
in this house
he said he stayed with maurice
well he aint even here that much
i like to know where he goes but at the same time i dont want to know you understand
beat your dog was killed
got run over by a car
what did you call it
moselle looks at the couch where a mangled frisbee sits
was a she name tuffy
nods then where do you think i might find maurice
i dont know the gym the fights
know he dont miss the fights
having some tomorrow night at the state theater
he use to take me
the state theater
what you want with maurice
karen turns sees kenneth standing in the arched entrance from the foyer
she looking for a man name of glenn
did i ask you
go on out of here
do something with yourself
he waits until moselle gets up not saying a word walks away from them through the dining room
karen watches him come toward her now in kind of an easy strut
she indicates the scar over his eye
youre a fighter
how you know that
i can tell
was he moves his head in what might be a feint
till i got my retina detached two time
hes standing so close to her karen has to look up at him
whatd you fight middleweight
light to super middleweight as my body developed
you go about what bantam
you know your divisions
you like the fights
like the rough stuff
yeah i bet you do
moves closer like to get down and tussle a little bit
like me and tuffy before she got run over we use to get down on the floor and tussle
i say to her you a good dog tuffy heres a treat for you
and i give tuffy what every dog love best
you know what that is
real close i can give you a bone too girl
youre not my type
i let the monster out you gonna do what it wants
just a minute
her hand goes into her bag next to the chair
bring your own rubbers with you
her hand comes out of the bag holding what looks like the grip on a golf club
kenneth grins at her
what else you have in there mace
have a whistle different kinds of female protection shit
karen pushes out of the chair to stand with him face to face
i have to go kenneth
she gives him a friendly poke with the black vinyl baton thats like a golf club grip
maybe well see each other again okay
she steps aside and brushes past him
he grabs her left wrist
we gonna tussle first
karen flicks the baton and sixteen inches of chrome steel shoots out of the grip
she pulls an arms length away from him and chops the rigid shaft at his head kenneth hunching ducking away
god damn he lets go of her and karen gets the room she needs so that when he comes at her she whips the shaft across the side of his
head and he howls stops dead presses a hand over his ear
whats wrong with you
you wanted to tussle we tussled
and she walks out
she sees moselle standing there in the foyer
karen looks at her a moment puts the baton in her purse and comes out with a business card
i wrote my hotel number on there in case you run into glenn
moselle slips the card into the pocket of her robe
karen smiles at her and walks out the door
its snowing pretty hard when foley and buddy pull up out front
buddy wipes the condensation off his window so they can see the house
now thats a really big house
jesus look at that wall
place almost looks like a prison
no doubt the mans got some big ass security system
time comes we knock on the door
see if he wants to talk about old times
go in the easy way
you think hell let us in we got snoopy and the muscle bound asshole with us
who says anybodys gonna be with us
i say we go to the fights tomorrow find out what the snoops big plan is then go in ahead of those guys alone let glenn deal with the snoop
while were off livin the good life
tell me something buddy
you know anyone whos actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life
cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it but i dont know anyone whos actually gone and done it
beat what about that d
foley looks at him
i mean they dont know for sure hes dead
then look theres always a chance well walk outve there with nothing
i say let fate decide
let fate decide
whatre you the fuckin dali lama now
my sister believes in fate but not hell
thats why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you dont hear that much about purgatory anymore
but every day she asks her boss to pray i dont fuck up
whatta you think you think theres a hell jack
yeah its called glades correctional institution and im sure as shit not going back there or any place like it
you might not have a choice
foley looks at him
they put a gun on you youll go back
they put a gun on you you still have a choice dont you
foley turns back to the house
and now we hear
i think youre gonna fit right in
the personnel guy mr
hearn sits behind his desk squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at foley who wears a shitty suit and tie
now mr ripley and i have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in
hows that sound to you
hearn pauses looks down at foley
youre about a long right
hearn walks out without answering
foley looks at the desktop where a spoon sticks out of a half eaten fruit on the bottom yogurt which in turn sits beside a half eaten powerbar
foley shakes his head takes out his zippo starts to play with it
lets see how she fits
foley turns as mr
hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a uniform draped over one arm
what is this
hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads security on one arm
are you kidding me
huge fucking aquarium
sir you cant go in there
ripley looks up from his desk as foley steps in the receptionist right behind him now
whoa whats the problem
take it easy lets talk
meanwhile ripley pushes a panic button beneath his desk
a security guard
are you fucking kidding me
ripley considers foley a moment then
you know i wasnt sure youd show up
but i was pretty sure that if you did youd throw the job in my face
then understand something jack
up to this point everything youve done with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world
less than nothing
foley says nothing
youre a bank robber
this is not a marketable skill
there are no old bank robbers out in the world living on pensions
you know this
thats why youre here right now
still foley says nothing
today im offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage
you think youre better than that
show me that youre really willing to change and well talk about something better
a lot better
but first jack you gotta earn it
the way you earned it
by marrying some rich broad owns the company selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her
what is this knute rockne pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit
back in prison guy like you place like that you were ice cream for freaks
you were a goddamn dumpling
maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing
till you were nothing
i saved your ass
so youll pardon me if i dont wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying sign in here please or hey pal you cant park there
i cant do it
jack im disappointed
i guess i misjudged you
two massive security guards appear in the doorway
hey what job he promise you guys
theres two ways we can do this
what are they
i think weve calmed down now
havent we jack
oh yeah im calm
in fact im totally relaxed
and with that he picks up a paperweight a lead fish and wings it at the aquarium shattering the glass
as foley is physically thrown out of the building by the two guards
he picks himself up
he kicks at the guards who wave him off go back inside
foley then starts down the steps pauses as he sees
the one from the opening foley looks at it a moment then calmly starts to take off his tie drops it in the gutter as he starts across the street
as buddy pulls away from the house foley pulls out the clipping of karen he tore out of the morning paper
hes written the name westin on it
listen i gotta get some better shoes few other things before tomorrow
why dont you drop me off at the ren cen well hook up later
yeah and i better call my sister
its really coming down
we then pull back to reveal were looking out of a window inside the cocktail lounge at the top of the westin
a table of three young executive looking guys in suits are laughing at something until karen is ushered by a waitress to an adjacent table
jack daniels please water on the side
she turns sees her reflection in the glass against the overcast sky snow swirling blowing in gusts seven hundred feet above the city down there somewhere
celeste do us again please and put the ladys drink on our bill
she turns to see them raising snifter glasses to her smiling pleasant looking guys in dark suits
drifting over they want to buy you a drink
i get that
tell them id rather pay for my own
she then watches the three guys looking at the waitress delivering the message
then they look at karen
she gives them a shrug turns to watch the snow
her drink arrives
she takes a sip looks up as one of the guys comes over
my associates and i made a bet on what you do for a living
she glances at the table the other two watching
and i won
hi im philip
if its okay with you philip id like to just have a quiet drink and leave
dont you want to know what i guessed
how i know what you do for a living
tell you the truth im not even mildly curious
really i dont want to be rude philip id just like to be left alone
she turns back to the snowstorm
she sees his reflection turn and leave
a moment later the next one appears at the table
i think i know why youre depressed if i may offer an observation
she just looks at him
so sure of himself
i have a hunch youre the new sales rep and your customer isnt exactly knocked out by the idea of a young lady even one as stunning as you handling
am i close
hi im andy
she says nothing to him
were ad guys
we flew in from new york this morning to pitch hiram walker distillery present this test market campaign for their new margarita mix
what we do we show this guy who looks like a mexican bandido you know with the big chihuahua hat the bullet belts andy
who gives a shit
he gives her a sympathetic expression
want to tell me what happened
beat it will you
she stares at the guy until he turns away
she sips her drink stares once more out at the blizzard
after a few moments another dark suit appears reflected in the window
can i buy you a drink
not one of the executive guys
she stares at the reflection for a moment then slowly turns looks up at jack foley now standing there in his new navy blue suit
beat yeah id love one
then would you like to sit down
he pulls the chair out looking at her
the three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down
foley offers his hand
she hesitates then shakes his hand
she smiles with him
when she lowers her hand to the table his hand comes down to cover hers
she watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly his eyes not leaving hers and lays her hand on his
the tips of her fingers brush his knuckles lightly back and forth
it takes hours to get a drink around here
theres only one waitress
i can go to the bar
dont leave me
those guys bother you
no theyre all right
i meant you just got here
she picks up her drink and places it in front of him
she watches him take a sip smack his lips
you like bourbon
passes the glass back well we got that out of the way
then tell me celeste
what do you do for a living
im a sales rep
i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because im a girl
is that how you think of yourself
what as a sales rep
i dont have a problem with it
i like your hair
and that suit
i had one just like it well it was the same idea but i had to get rid of it
having it cleaned didnt help huh
then what do you do for a living gary
beat how far do we go with this
this stops her throws her off balance
dont say anything yet
i dont think it works if were somebody else
you know what i mean
gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything
its your game
ive never played this before
its not a game
something you play
well does it make sense to you
it doesnt have to its something that happens
its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of
like you both know something
but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it
go and you think what if i had stopped and said something
it might happen only a few times in your life
they look at each other a moment then
why dont we get out of here
they both get up
the ad guys at the table watch as she follows foley to the elevator
karen winks at them
as they ride down to karens room
she looks at him looks away
the doors open and they exit
as he follows her in
she walks to the bar fixes them each a drink
he checks out the room takes in her view
howd you find me
he comes over to her takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her
i called your room from downstairs
if i had answered what were you gonna say
well id say who i was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink
if i remembered you
i came looking for you
i wouldve said sure lets do it
but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team
why would you trust me
it would be worth the risk
she looks at him touches his face with her hand
you like taking risks
so do you
he kisses her now puts his arms around her
whats the hurry jack
you have to be somewhere
she hands him his drink
they both drink then
sooner or later
she stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass
you really wear that suit
thats not what you were about to say
she shrugs lets it go
he puts down his drink kisses her
she lets him then moves to the couch
remember how talkative you were
in the trunk
adele said you do that when youre nervous
she did huh
you kept touching me feeling my thigh
yeah but in a nice way
he sits down and they kiss again
this time she peels his jacket off
he does the same with hers
hes starting to unbutton her blouse when unbuttoning i mightve smelled like a sewer but you could tell i was a gentleman
they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy
he killed a police officer
looks at her
i hear he didnt mean to
the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart
you believe that
she looks at him decides to get off this subject
anyway hes finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt
she closes her eyes
you know that sig
you took was my favourite
my father gave it to me
as he kisses her on the neck
what were you gonna do with me
i dont know
i hadnt worked that part out yet
all i knew was that i liked you and i didnt want to leave you there never see you again
you waved to me in the elevator
shes loosening his tie unbuttoning his shirt
i wasnt sure you caught that
i couldnt believe it
i was thinking of you by then a lot wondering what it would be like if we did meet
like if we could take a time out
i was thinking the same thing
if we could call time and get together for a while
they look at each other a moment
you know i saw you on the street
he starts to kiss her again but you were going to see her
to warn her about chino
so she did help you
i dont think we should get into that
no youre right
i wont ask if hes with you or what youre doing here in detroit
or if youve run into glenn michaels yet
dont talk like that okay
you scare me
and he moves to kiss her but she stands up holds out her hand
he gets up and she leads him across the room
jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes stands up to take off his pants
are you gonna leave your tie on
he looks at her down to her bra and panties watches as she gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him standing close to help
him with the tie
my god look at you
when her clothes are off she loops the tie around his neck again and then as she turns off the light
she kisses him
he sits down on the bed drawing her back with him the only light now coming from the sitting room
you having fun
she smiles and then they start to make love as we then
eyes open serious now
shes lying in jacks arms
she looks at him a moment then moves away from him to sit up and swing her legs off the bed
you coming back
im just going to the bathroom
she gets up and crosses the room to the bathroom and closes the door
foley picks up his zippo off the night table
she comes in
looks at herself in the mirror
suddenly feels self conscious
she grabs a bathrobe off the door
foley lies there fiddling with the zippo staring up at the ceiling
she comes out again and stands looking down at him
i want you to know something
i wasnt looking for just a fuck if thats what youre thinking
why are you mad
or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill
score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade
what about my motive
now i can say i fucked a us marshal
you think i will
i dont know
he raises the covers but she just stands there
i know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin
he scores some cash off a teller hes on his way out when he drops the bottle
it shatters on the tile floor he slips in the stuff cracks his head and theyve got him
the nitro was canola oil
i know more fucked up bank robbers than ones that know what theyre doing
i doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one
most bank robbers are fucking morons
to go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills as you say youd have to be as dumb as they are
i know youre not dumb so why would i think that
why would you think i might think that
she comes over and sits down on the bed
youre not dumb
i dont know about that
you cant do three falls and think you have much of a brain
they lie there for a few moments karen watching him
he senses this looks at her
you getting serious on me now
im trying not to
i just wanna know whats gonna happen
beat you know
and he kisses her
the sun is out
the snow has stopped falling
a white blanket covers everything
karen opens her eyes wakes up
she closes them again lies on her side but doesnt move for a moment
oh for christ sake grow up
she opens her eyes and rolls on to her back
she turns her head foleys gone
she gets out of bed
karen comes into the room tying her robe
she looks at the coffee table where
something wrapped in a napkin lies by the half empty bottle and the ice bucket
she picks it up and slowly unfolds the gift from foley her sig sauer
buddy stands at the window looking out as foley in his underwear sits at the table reading the newspaper a room service breakfast a bottle of jim beam close by
it took you what seven hours to buy a pair of shoes
i saw karen sisco
buddy turns to him
and she saw you
yes she did
so hows that work a wanted felon socializing with a u
you know how i felt about her
did you give her a jump
if you did i might begin to understand where your heads at
it wasnt about getting laid
i just wanted to know what mightve happened if things were different
you find out
yeah i did
buddy watches foley pour a shot of jim beam in his coffee
so whats that mean
that youre disappointed by what you found or youre sorry you robbed all those banks
i dont know
karen sits there staring at a wild turkey bottle a couple of glasses
she reaches for the phone dials
a moment later we hear marshall siscos answering machine and she hangs up
a ring set up on stage
men hang out on the side
where movie seats used to be are rows of round nightclub tables a row of them on each of four levels rising a step at a time up through the
theatre to the bar
rap music booms out of speakers as fighters are announced
everyone in here is black except for glenn and white boy bob who sit at a table in the front row while maurice in a dude black felt cap set
on his head just right and shades walks along the apron of the stage
stick and jab stick and jab
white boy bob throws down a beer and gives glenns shoulder a jab
you drink like a girl
white boy looks around to see if there are any other morons sitting nearby who think its funny
kenneth comes through for his pal and laughs
as karen walks through the bar pauses as she sees glenn sitting with white boy and kenneth
she steps back into the shadows as glenn glances anxiously about
as he pushes his chair back
i got to go take a piss
he hesitates sees the car keys on the table in front of white boy bob
but before he can grab them
whatre you telling us for
you want somebody to hold your little pecker
glenn gets up sees his coat on the back of the chair but knows he cant take it with him
he walks away from the table
glenn exits the theater and crosses to the parking lot
karen exits right after watches him get into the town car
glenn behind the wheel half lying on his right side as he tries to rip open the locked glove compartment
his head jerks around as karen opens the door
he sits up straight as she gets in with him
glenn are you trying to steal this car
jesus i dont believe it
another one of those days huh nothing seems to go right
he raises his empty hands
i dont have the keys

look at it that way
and he takes off
she sits there another moment then flicks her cigarette out the door gets out the car
karen looks across the street at the theatre sees people leaving
a few seconds later she steps behind a car and watches as buddy and foley pull into the lot
maurice sits with white boy and kenneth as foley and buddy come down the aisle to their table
where you been
you miss the big boys come in time for the walkout fights
well shit you may as well pull up a chair
foley and buddy remain standing

foley nods to the raincoat draped over the back of a chair

glenn knows everything we suppose to do tomorrow glenn could tell somebody that yeah but it dont mean shit

yeah well what i say to jack foley is buuull shit its snowing as maurice white boy bob kenneth buddy and foley pile into the back of a van the
name of some plumbing and heating company on the side
we pull back to reveal that were watching from inside karens car
she waits for the van to pull away then follows
kenneth the fucking maniac at the wheel
buddy and foley piled into the back of the van full of plastic pipe and equipment
maurice pulls on a pair of white coveralls

foley and buddy exchange looks
maurice turns around a beretta in his hand
foley looks at him

ive seen em used on tv
maurice hands foley the beretta
then reaches into a bag comes up with a
he hands to buddy
as karen tries to keep up with the van
but with the snow and the way kenneth drives she starts to lose them
she speeds up around a corner and loses control of the car
as karens car does a in the ice and snow
buddy and foley are jostled about the back from kenneths insane driving
kenneth grins in the mirror punches it more
buddy gets out the
and touches it to the back of kenneths head
get ready to grab the wheel when i shoot this asshole
kenneth his eyes freaked with speed glares at buddy in the mirror
do like he says man
as a pissed off karen gets out of her car watches the van disappear
shit she takes out her cellphone punches a number re orients her car at the same time
as the van creeps by one way then the other then pulls into the driveway
all five of them in the back end of the van now bumping into each other until maurice lets white boy out the rear end leaving the doors open enough
so he can watch
he then racks the slide on a
will stop all jive
you think he was talking about walking into peoples houses when he said it
maurice looks at buddy
buddy holds his gaze
then the coach lights on either side of the front entrance come on
pulls his mask down get ready to go skiing
now the front door opens
here we go
we catch a glimpse of a woman in the doorway arms folded over her bathrobe as white boy gives her a push and steps inside the house with her
maurice is out of the truck and kenneth with a shotgun is scrambling to be next
buddy catches him by his jacket collar and holds him squirming until foley is out
the minute kenneths feet hit the driveway he turns the gauge on buddy still in the truck
foley takes the barrel in one hand and shoves it straight up in kenneths face
go on in the house before you get hurt
kenneth puts his face up close to foleys and stares at him good before going inside
foley turns to buddy
theres still time take me up on my offer
im not leaving you alone with these assholes
where maurice has the woman backed against a table
shes in her forties with thick red hair hanging free
she looks ready to take a swing at whoever approaches

kenneth reaches out opens her robe and we get a flash of flimsy bra and low cut panties before she slaps him away

kenneth puts his arm around the maid

full of fat cushy chairs and a sofa everything white or black a wet bar a big tv cd player

kenneth is trying to find a radio station while maurice and white boy bob ransack the place
white boy bob checks under the mattress
hey maurice and kenneth look over expectantly

white boy the mans not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin mattress
maurice looks out the door sees buddy in the doorway

white boy bob slips out of the room
maurice turns to kenneth whos still playing with the stereo
kenneth fuck the radio put on a cd
looking them over i dont recognize none of these bands
just pick one put it on
white boy bob watches from the end of the hall as foley peers into each of the bedrooms
foley sees a back staircase and starts down
a moment later white boy bob follows
white boy bob comes down the stairs
no sign of foley
white boy starts down one hallway then turns back
now hes lost
he opens a door starts to walk into a closet then backs out
he goes down the hall turns into
where white boy bob enters calls out tentatively
he takes in the huge room the massive sub zero refrigerator
he moves to the freezer opens it takes in the frozen steaks
as foley quietly moves to the doorway peers into the kitchen watches white boy bob starts going through the freezer taking out steaks and stacking them up on the counter
foley shakes his head and moves on
as foley steps into the doorway we boom down to reveal a lighted aquarium in f
he comes into the room sits down in an armchair beside the fish tank
he leans close to the glass stares at the fish a moment
he sees a door reflected there and turns to look across the room sees how the phone cord disappears underneath
they cut the lines richard
the door opens and we see a terrified richard ripley sitting on top of a toilet the phone in his lap
how are you richard
jesus christ what the hell are you doing here
whats going on
maurice miller couple of his friends
ripley moves to the doorway
have they got midge up there
what kinda man lets a woman answer the door this time a night
we thought it might be her husband
sometimes he comes and checks up on her
she told him i was down in florida
a minute or two youre gonna wish you were
ripley looks at him
foley pats the back of a chair
why dont you come on over here sit down richard have a look at your fish
as karen slowly negotiates her way through the snowstorm
the music on loud herb alpert tijuana taxi
buddy stands in the doorway watches maurice out of his coveralls as he takes suits and sport coats from the walk in closet to look them over
he tries on a coat turns to the maid
how do i look mama
like a fag
maurice smiles at her goes back into the closet
kenneth stares at the maid nodding slowly
i think she like to tussle with me
get boned a way she gonna remember
she looks to the doorway where buddy now starts to take a step into the room when maurice comes out of the closet
he sticks his head out of the closet
i found the safe
buddy backs out of the room
as karen drives slowly past the house
white boy bob emerges with an armload of steaks and sets them on the front steps
get your ass up here
white boy bob hurries back into the house
ripley sits on the couch across from foley
he keeps looking up at the ceiling
what do you want from me jack
you want money
you gonna write me a check
well go to my bank
ill make a withdrawal
foley just looks at him
buddy sticks his head in the room
they found the safe
you remember buddy dont you richard
white boy bob comes in as kenneth and maurice are getting ready to blast the safe with the shotgun and pistol
we gonna open up this fucker
maurice and his boys open fire on the safe
the maid covers up as bullets begin ricocheting all over the room
karen sees the muzzle flashes in the upstairs window and quickly gets out of the car
as buddy and ripley look up
gets up good god
theyre shooting midge
pushes him down siddown dick
theyre trying to open the safe not your maid
as maurice kenneth and white boy bob get ready to fire again
aight this time we gotta get the motherfuckin trajectory right
pause okay on three one
the combination is three ten forty four
they all turn to look at her guns still pointing at the safe
as karen cautiously makes her way towards the front door
as maurice finally gets the safe open
they all anxiously peer inside
maurice narrows his eyes reaches in pulls out one of three toupees
he stares at it
the fuck is this
are they dead
he looks at white boy bob
go find foley
as foley leans forward in the chair now
i cant believe youre still angry with me jack after all this time
im not angry richard
staring at the tank in fact im completely relaxed
thing is i cant tell if its the fish thatre cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there
ripley sags closes his eyes
damn and now buddy takes a closer look and now we too see that strewn about the bottom of the aquarium are dozens of uncut diamonds of various sizes
dumbfuck glenn was right theres about five million worth in there wouldnt you say richard
five point two
they look like plain old rocks

he gets up looks at buddy

foley turns to richard as buddy comes back into the room with a plastic bag starts reaching into the tank
i were you id get up and run

theyre gonna kill you
if thats my fate so be it
im not leaving

foley looks at buddy
foley just looks at ripley who doesnt move

buddy and foley slip out the other door down the hall just as maurice walks in some of ripleys clothes over his arm
well if it isnt the ripper hisself
are those my suits
where you been hiding dick
a now freezing karen hugs a retaining wall watches as foley and buddy emerge from the house
as buddy leans under the dash
foley looks up at the house where we see shadows moving about in the upstairs window hear the faint pumping of the music
we hear the van start
buddy straightens up looks at foley
come on shit
theyre gonna rape the maid arent they
from the looks of those boys the ripper too
and then theyll kill em
foley looks at the diamonds in the bag
we made it didnt we
all you gotta do is get in

im going back inside

foley finally hands him the bag with the diamonds in it
no you dump the van meet me at the airport
ill take one of ripleys cars
jack listen buddy the shit thats about to go down youll be on the phone with your sister for a month
let me do this part alone
buddy just looks at him
im saying this isnt your problem
far as im concerned were square
foley turns to go
buddy hands him his gun
foley takes it stuffs it in the back of his pants and then turns back to the house
now get outta here
as she watches foley go back inside
a moment later the van pulls out of the driveway
karen makes a decision starts for the side of the house
foley enters and we hear the maid scream
foley starts up the stairs
maurice and white boy bob both have their guns to ripleys head
hears the scream midge
forget about her
tell me where the moneys at
foleys got it
where the fuck is foley
foley comes up the stairs heads for ripleys bedroom
the door is closed now
he steps to one side is about to reach for the knob when suddenly the door is blasted off its hinges
karen comes through the door hears the gunshot stops cold
as foley steps into the doorway and we see kenneth and the maid bare both sitting up in bed kenneth racking the shotgun the maid turning away from him gathering
the covers that hang off her side of the bed
and coming around to throw them like a net at kenneth as the shotgun goes off and the covers catch fire as foley pumps one two three shots into kenneth
somewhere under there
as ripley tries to get away
maurice grabs him by the collar spins him around and whips him across the face with his gun
he and white boy bob then both hit ripley on the head until he goes down and stays down
to wbb you take the front stairs ill take the back
as the maid jumps up and drags the burning covers from the bed and sees kenneth now the bullet holes in his chest staring blankly back at him
she then looks at foley
cold wheres dick
then but wait here
theres two more
as foley starts out of the room and immediately hears
hold it asshole
foley sees white boy bob at the bottom of the stairs
drop the gun
nowhere to go foley has to comply
now stay right there
white boy bob starts to jog up the stairs two at a time all the while keeping his eyes fixed on foley
i got foley
as maurice starts up the backstairs
and a moment later karen comes out of the kitchen into the downstairs hallway just missing each other
as white boy bob gets maybe half way up when he catches a toe on one of the risers and pitches forward
stupidly he tries to break his fall with the elbow of his gun hand and ends up jamming his chin down onto the muzzle of his gun which unfortunately for
him goes off firing a bullet through his head and killing him instantly
to say the least foley is stunned by this freak accident
he stands there looking at the dead bulk on the stairs
finally you learn from doing
foley bends down to pick up his gun and we see maurice coming up the back staircase his gun raised and now firing away
foley is forced to jump back behind a pillar as maurice keeps firing at him shots ricocheting off the pillar the railing the wall
as karen hugs the wall at the sound of gunshots sees ripley lying on the floor of the study
as we hear click as the breech opens on maurices now empty
and now foley steps out from behind the pillar and calmly bends down picks up his gun maurice still walking forward
jack you dont use a gun do you
not until recently
still coming nervous
getting close this kind of setup you dont have any idea what the fuck youre doing do you
so why take a chance foley pulls the trigger
maurice hesitates surprised that foley would pull the trigger then the two of them at the same time rush each other begin a messy mano a mano now using their
spent guns as bludgeons
as karen carefully comes into the room ripley lets out a low groan
shes bending down to check him when her phone rings
as foley and maurice grapple on the floor near the head of the stairs
as karen answers her phone checks ripley
were a few minutes away
just sit tight stay outta the house till we get there understand
as foley finally shoves maurice down the stairs
maurice rolls down a few steps right over white boy bob as
foley gets up runs back to the bedroom
as foley enters goes straight to kenneths body begins searching for the shotgun lifting the covers turning over the body etc with no success
as maurice attempts to prise the gun out from under the dead bulk of white boy bob
as foley exasperated stands back up
this what you want
foley looks to where midge stands now back in her bathrobe but more importantly clutching the shotgun
foley crosses and takes it from her begins to stride out of the room when its empty
foley just looks at her
as maurice finally rolls white boy bob over grabs the gun
as foley sticks his hand in kenneths coveralls comes out with a shell loads the gun snaps it shut
as maurice cocks the pistol takes a step up the stairs
maurice maurice spins around points his gun down at karen now standing in the foyer her own gun pointing up at him
as raymond cruz and several green and whites arrive
as jack about to exit stops cold as he hears two gunshots then a body fall
he stands still
not sure who was just shot
after a long moment we then hear jack
he sees midge looking at him closes his eyes sags against the wall
i know youre up there
as foley steps into the hallway his ski mask now pulled down over his face
he holds kenneths shotgun in one hand and his pistol in another
come on jack dont
pretend im somebody else
you think id shoot you
foley brings up the pistol and the shotgun
and now we hear if you dont one of those guys will
whatre you now a desperado
put the guns down
i told you im not going back
he raises the guns hip high and we hear sounds behind karen but shes quick to raise her hand though she doesnt turn or look around
dont do this
they stand there staring at each other
no more time outs
he raises the guns
she sadly shakes her head
you win jack
she fires and he falls to the staircase dropping the guns grabbing hold of his right thigh
and now cruz and several other cops enter
karen motions them to stop
karen i told you not to wait i know him okay
she goes up the staircase to where foley is lying and gently lifts the ski mask and looks at his sad eyes
im sorry jack but i cant shoot you
you just did for christ sake
you know what i mean
she glances about makes sure no one can hear then leans closer to him
i wish things were different
im sorry jack
foley looks like hes in pain
he watches as she walks back down the stairs
as a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up foley a shaky ripley staggers into the foyer
she comes running down the stairs into his arms
he looks at foley over her shoulder
sympathetic listen jack
but then whatd you do with my diamonds
foley just looks at him
as buddy pulls the van into an alley
he jumps out jogs back to the street and hails a cab
buddy suddenly gets in bangs on the bulletproof glass
the cab pulls away
buddy glances up front then pulls the ziploc bag from his coat and holds it up
theres a bit of water in along with the diamonds
a tiny fish swims in the water
something about this makes buddy smile as we
the sun is out
the sky is clear
they dont know yet if they want to bring him up on the homicides
karen on the phone
her suitcase on the bed
i doubt if they will
the bureaus put a detainer on him so when theyre through with him here hell go back to florida
marshall on the phone
you gonna go get him
i was just thinking
you could have a nice time with him on the plane like picking up where your interlude or whatever you call it left off
and then throw him in the can
he knew what he was doing
nobody forced him to rob banks
my little girl the tough babe
karen hangs up stares thoughtfully out the window
where foley stands staring out of his window
as foley turns around and faces a federal marshal in the doorway we see that foleys hands and feet are shackled
the marshal leads foley from the building to where a black government van waits
the marshal helps foley inside
have a nice trip
looks os ill get the other one
as foley sits down stares at the floor
he looks depressed
we hear the front door open then close
he looks to where karen looks at him through a steel grate that separates the front from the back
i got you a present something for the road
she pushes a zippo through the grate
i have to take it away though soon as the rides over
before foley can say anything the back door is opened once more and the marshal helps another prisoner a black man with a shaved head into the back of the
jack foley meet hejira henry
an annoyed foley stares at the guy as the marshal shuts the door then gets in up front with karen
what kinda name is that
whats it mean no hair
the hejira was the flight of mohammed from mecca in
the brothers in leavenworth gave me the name
you were at leavenworth huh
for a time
meaning time came i left
you busted out
i prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place
interested now and how long was it before they caught up with you
there were others
that was the ninth
really interested the ninth ten you count the prison hospital in ohio i walked away from
you must be some kinda walker henry
and so now youre off to glades
i was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal but for some reason she wanted to wait
looks at karen she did huh
cheaper i guess take us both down in one van
yeah could be
or maybe she thought wed have a lot to talk about
i dont know
then its a long way down to florida
foley glances at her then turns back to heiira henry and considers the guy a smile on foleys face his spirits a little higher than when he first sat down
as we then
