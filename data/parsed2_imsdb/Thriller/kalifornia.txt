screenplay by tim metcalfe based on a story by stephen levy and tim metcalfe its raining like hell
flashes of lightning reveal momentary glimpses of a decayed urban industrial landscape
far below us a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the drowning earth
we descend toward the rock
sporadic flashes of lightning distort our perspective of the stone
it looks strangely beautiful like a diamond stuck in the dark mud
suddenly strong male hands cut across the frame and wrench it free from its muddy grave
and we discover that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with every kind of slithering repulsive insect
lightning obliterates the frame
flashes of light from lightning car headlights photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout the following sequences as recurring transitional devices
we can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of an inner city what we can see looks half demolished
through chain link fencing the blinding headlights of a s chevy arc into frame
for an instant we see the fleeting image of a pretty teenage girl
on her feet a pair of bright red high heeled shoes
the chevy pulls up next to her
an oncoming cars headlights streak across the beat up chevys windshield
the driver ish as he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door
the pretty teenage girl slides into the car
dressed only in a skirt and t shirt shes soaked to the skin
make up runs down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders
she seems nervous
as she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has been injured
its bound with coarse white toweling and stained with blood
in her other hand she clings tightly to a cheap yellow leather purse
he reaches forward and puts his hand on the gear shift the back of his hand brushing against her leg she moves away
he slides the gear shift into drive
another cars headlights flare the windshield as he pulls out into the night
a powerful photographic strobe light ignites
revealing a decrepit warehouse interior
silhouetted briefly against the paint chipped walls are two figures a man brian kessler short chopped hair dressed in black on black and a woman carrie laughlin short black hair
and tight black clothes
carrie holds a mm still camera an umbilical cord runs to a strobe light
brian holds a flashlight in one hand a tape recorder in the other
he begins speaking into the tape recorder
her father worked the night shift here
most nights hed bring her with him
pause she was eleven years old
his flashlight scans the ominous environment
carrie takes flash photo
emerging from the blackness
the same strong male hands that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket clear of his torso
a crude bandage wrapped around one of the fingers
the rock is slipped up under his jacket
up against his bare chest
the jacket is pulled down to conceal the rock and the faceless figure drifts away
the beam of brians flashlight sweeps through the darkness revealing another room
this is it
this is the where hed take her whenever he had the urge to molest her
the flashlight finds the corner in question
the warehouse lights up again revealing a huge machine room
nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines
a male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his cars front window
the windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the constant sheet of rain beyond
this defroster never works
the driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs
he finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work
the girl leans forward into the stream of warm air
she closes her eyes lets it blow across her face
he watches her
his eyes linger on her body
have a problem with your car
she pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a nervous smile
beat my problems with men
he throws a curious look at her then back to the highway
brians flashlight moves around the room
this is where she murdered her first victim
they found his body over in the corner shot through the head
the flashlight continues to search through the darkness
they found her second victim over there
very close on the girls yellow purse
as the metal zipper is pulled open
the driver notices her opening the purse
okay if i smoke
the driver watches as she reaches into the purse
out a soggy pack of matches
she looks at them
i look to the driver
my matches are all wet
you got a lighter
scans the dashboard yeah
its here somewhere
its my wifes car
there it is
he pushes the cigarette lighter in to heat
out of the corner of his eye he sees the girls hand slip back in her purse
and stay there
she stares at the car lighter and
the driver glances at her then back to the lighter
as another strobe light ignites
tape recorder hand brian continues
she lured them here with the promise of sex
beat imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place
did she use that to help her pull the trigger
carrie snaps another shot
the blinding flash illuminates the night rain streaming in through the fractured remains of the ceiling
brian stops talking
carrie scans the darkness
from the quiet
a thunderous roar
a blinding flash
a semi trailer crosses paths with the s chevy
close on the girl
an intent expression on her face as she watches and waits
for the cigarette lighter to eject
his hand reaches deeper into her purse
the driver tenses as he sees this
the lighter ejects
the driver reaches for the dash
the girl hurriedly lifts something out from inside the bag
the driver yanks the lighter out
and whips a look to the girl
brians flashlight sweeps across the shadowed remains of the rafters and catwalks
brian and carrie glance tentatively at each other
then slowly carrie lifts the portable strobe unit upward until it is pointing into the rafters
carrie fires a shot triggering a brilliant flash
out of the inky black
the glistening wet rock emerges hurtling downwards
tumbling end over end through the night rain
the girl pulls a pack of cigarettes out of her purse
she looks curiously to the driver whose hand is trembling slightly
whats the matter
the girl reaches out steadies his trembling hand
and pulls the red hot coil to the cigarette between her lips
in a thunderous crash
the glistening wet rock comes smashing through their windshield
the chevy brakes
skids across the rain slicked pavement and turns a somersault landing upside down on its hood
the camera drifts across the fractured front end of the overturned chevy
the twisted hunk of metal hisses
the front tire spins lazily to a halt on its mangled axle
we see a man standing on a highway overpass
hes leaning on the railing and calmly looking down at the wrecked car
early grayce athletic build big watery eyes jet black hair stands by the railing
rain streaks down his expressionless face
he dropped the rock
lying in the deserted highway
the driver crawls out covered with blood
still clutched in his hand is the car cigarette lighter
its red hot coil extinguishing quickly to a faint glow
calmly looking down with no pity
water running down his face
on his eye
and right into the dilated pupil
as we enter it its like being in a dark winding tunnel filled with the hum of dynamos and the loud rhythmic pumping of powerful machinery
the distant echo of a womans voice
are you dead or alive
still hearing the whine from some tremendous dynamo we emerge from the inside of brians right eardrum pulling back far enough to see his face
brian is distracted distant not paying attention to the game of twenty questions that he is playing
a small party in progress
graduate student types smoking drinking
carrie and brian stand out in this group their look is more stylized their attitude less complacent
carrie in particular looks restless
man or woman
carrie tunes in and pays attention to the game
real or fictional
brians eyes dart to carrie
the look on his face tells everyone she nailed it
brian gets up to get another drink
several people laugh amazed that carrie knows brian so well
what a guess
doesnt count shes disqualified
because youve been living with him and his thesis for the last year and a half
beat hes probably been researching ted bundy all week
carl you are the worlds worst loser
carl looks over to carrie
she gives him the finger and a cheeky smile
carol sitting next to carrie asks
any word from that gallery
lets not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show
anyway californias loaded with galleries
nods toward brian you mean ted bundys finally agreed to leave
carrie watches brian disappear into another room
soon as he finishes his thesis
listen erics been finishing his for over three years now
carrie lights a cigarette
her frustration is showing
yeah well brians got til the end of the summer then im outta here
she gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded room
im sorry but i just cant see you veggin out in la la land
oh i dont know
i think that once i dye my hair blonde buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan
i could be veggin out with the best of em
does a valley girl beach bunny like fer shurr
carrie and carol share a strained laugh
sequence omitted from original script
the rooms crowded with people
theres a lot of noise shop talk banter
clipped conversations overlap as we find brian with his friend eric
they are in the midst of making a blender of margaritas
im talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer
someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned let alone executed
eric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as brian pours in the booze
oh here we go again
lets just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods
look its a fact most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance
beat that enough tequila
brian pours in the rest of the bottle
to eric the answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions not the electric chair
eric looks for triple sec in the cupboards
peter overhears them on his way to the refrigerator
yeah until its your mothers head they find in the refrigerator
he pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers
carrie steps up behind brian
executing the killer wouldnt bring my mother back
brian turns to see carrie now behind him
she wraps her arms around his neck
sarcastic to carrie ha ha
yeah but itd sure make you feel better wouldnt it
no it wouldnt make me feel better
peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator
looking for this
eric takes the triple sec from peter and pours some in the blender
he turns it on
to brian if i have to listen to one more tweed talk about his dissertation im going to throw up
to brian label it anyway you want the bottom line is these people are evil plain and simple
continuing with eric okay now you want to talk about good versus evil
well then lets start with adam and eve and the snake
who do i have to blow to get out of here
i gotta go
a relic from the fifties with large glass windows
the rain has stopped but the streets are still wet
earlys piece of shit grand prix pulls into the lot
he gets out and walks into the diner
the place is almost empty
early still wet from the rain walks to the counter and sits down
he calls out to the kitchen
coffee and a bowl of chili please
be right there
the only other customer is an old man sitting at the counter nearby nursing a cup of coffee
his face half hidden under a rain soaked hat
early selects a tune from the countertop juke box
out of the corner of his eye he sees a bug from the concrete block crawl out of earlys sleeve and onto the counter
from beneath his shadowy brim
the antichristll be a woman in a mans body
seven heads and seven tails
early gazes at the old man curiously then calls out to the waitress
make that to go
early notices the small bug crawling across the counter
he leans closer to it and watches it
after a moment he thwacks it off the counter with his thumb and finger
the bug lands on the hot iron griddle with a sizzle
early glances at the old man again
then scoots over one stool closer to him
early seems curious to want to get a glimpse under the brim of the old mans hat
the waitress is bagging earlys order to go
when the front door slams shut
the waitress re enters the room
neither the old man nor early are there
with earlys food in hand she makes her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door
she glances around curiously
on the griddle the remains of something black and charred smoulders
closer to the entrance she stares at the front door
the sign that hangs in its window has been turned
the backside which faces her reads she wonders about the sign for a moment then stares curiously out the window
not a soul in sight
she locks the door and begins closing up for the night
she turns to make her way to the rear of the diner then notices something
slowly she moves along the side wall past a number of highbacked booths
sitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are a pair of red high heeled shoes the same pair worn earlier by the pretty teenage girl
the waitress glances nervously about the interior
no one in sight
she reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes
looks at them closely
stares at the inside lining
then suddenly out of the quiet
the waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers
early leans out from behind the highback partition
thats right aint it size
smiles nods shyly
happy birthday adele
early you are so sweet
this is adele corners
shes pretty uneducated and earlys girlfriend
she steps over to him gives him a kiss then sits down on the seat across from him
she starts to try on her new shoes
i feel kind of like the wizard of oz you know when she gets the red shoes
well dorothy why dont you hand me that chili there
she passes the bag to early
he digs in
between bites he glances over to adele whos enthusiastically pulling on the new shoes
a door swings open spilling light into a darkened room
brian and carrie a little drunk return home from the party
their apartment is in an old converted industrial building in a funky low rent part of town
brian walks ahead carrie trails behind him peeling off her clothes
she begins unzipping her dress unnoticed by brian
tonight turned out to be pretty interesting
she grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair
im not that drunk
it was definitely the high point of the evening
carries dress falls to the floor
getting excited just being there where it really happened
it was different
i love it when you talk like that
brian is at the foot of the bed he turns to see
carrie has transformed
she has stripped down to her black bra and panties fishnet stockings a nightporter style leather cap
a surprised brian stands there a moment
looking at carrie
she looks great
carrie pushes brian back onto the bed
carrie climbs on top of him
she kisses his neck
slowly starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach
a solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house
through the soot tinged atmosphere sunlight filters in past the curtained windows
early is lying face down in bed his right arm extended over the side
adele is in the kitchen half dressed and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of earlys shirts
she realizes the iron is out of water she sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with water
as she does she glances at a cactus on the counter
you thirsty lucy
she waters her small cactus lucy
bet that feels good dont it
adele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor
she picks it up
now if that aint mommas little angel
adele puts it back onto the fridge
it is a photo of a young early with his mother
in the photo early appears to be about ten or eleven
he stands next to his mother
her arm is draped over his shoulders she is holding a drink
a cigarette butt dangles between her fingers
nearby a portable radio is tuned to music when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to the news
a handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his eyes
the newscasters voice gets louder
two more victims last night when a twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car
slowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off one eye
even closer on his left eyelid
pops open and blinks
his eyeball stares right at us
the pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light
the newscasters voice continues to amplify
this was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway
no arrests have yet been made
the newscasters voice quickly fades away
early calmly closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep
early emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer
he looks around the yard its full of various kinds of useless junk
he walks over to his car
adele appears in the doorway of the trailer in her bathrobe
she glances around to make certain that no ones looking then flashes her body to early with a giggle
have a good one
adele turns back into the trailer then remembers
i forgot to tell you mr
diebold was by again yesterday
early looks at the run down house next door where diebold lives
a beat up red pick up is parked in front
he said if he aint got the rest of his money by the end of the month hes gonna kick us the
spells the word fuck to avoid saying it f u c k outta here
early works his jaw thinking
he said that huh
cursed in front of you
you gonna talk to him
early gets in his car
if he comes back dont answer the door
early revs the raspy engine
suppose he hears me inside
adeles words are unheard as early pulls away flinging his beer bottle at a couple of chained pitbulls in diebolds front yard
sequence omitted from original script
brian enters the darkened loft interior
i picked up some chinese
did you hear from the gallery
brian turns the corner hes immediately greeted by a series of erotic images being projected on the far wall
they are slides of carries photographic work
in regard to the nature and content of carries photographic work her photographs address the sexual collision of opposites
the subjects of her photographs are hypothetical and highly unlikely partners
studies in contract
moments of passion
tentative you got your slides back
from across the room he hears carries disembodied voice
he drifts toward the couch
yeah same old shit
not suitable for mass consumption
one of those
brian finds her slumped down on the couch
he sits down
shes got a drink in her hand
a bottle on her lap
she continues to click through the slides
as she rambles on its obvious that shes definitely under the influence of something proof
christ brian im dying here
you are too you just dont know it yet
youre too busy working on that damned thesis
and thing is
when you finally do finish it its just gonna get filed away on some shelf at the university library
brian can see shes upset
drowsy from the booze
he just watches her
her words linger in his head
continues i thought you wanted to be a writer
quietly i do
then you can write anywhere
lets get out of here while we still can
carrie come on
we can leave anytime we
no we cant
we can never leave once you start talking about tenure
and vacation pay
and parking privileges and
lets just go to california now right now before its too late
just like that
just like that
load up the lincoln
point it west
stop when we hit the fucking ocean
the bold graphic sexual photographs of carries continue to accentuate her comments
thats half the kick anyway
doing something youve never done before
brian notices an envelope on the floor nearby
he picks it up
inside he finds the photographs carrie took at the warehouse
interested he shuffles through them
he becomes more and more intrigued with what he sees
these are great
he glances over to carrie
shes fallen asleep
he reaches over and quietly pulls the drink glass from her hand
earlys grand prix has a head of steam up as it tears across the drive and hangs a hard right into his parking space next to the trailer
suddenly early hits the brakes hard
another car is parked there
early spills through the doorway
adele whos cars that out
early spots his parole officer standing in the bedroom area snooping around
he has a prosthetic hand which he uses to search through earlys things
shes not here
the parole officer hiccups throughout the scene
what are you doin here
i aint supposed to be at the parole office til tomorrow two oclock
early notices the man looking through some of his letters and papers
the parole officer opens one of the closet doors pilfers through things inside as if searching for something
early is getting pissed off but says nothing
youre supposed to call me when you lose your job early
i stopped by the mirror factory today you left quite a mess behind there
wasnt my fault
he lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger
it was dangerous there and they treated me like shit
parole officer steps over to the refrigerator opens it snoops around inside
swallows a hiccup yeah
well you never have been treated right
hiccup your father was pickin on you when he threw you out of the house for stealing the tires off his truck
the marines misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge
he finishes with the refrigerator and continues his search through the drawers and cabinets of the trailer
hiccup the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death
and no doubt godll be pickin on you on judgement day
i aint got nothing against god
its the people he let come into the world
lot of them should have been stopped at the door
what are you looking for
the parole officer ignores the question
he steps up to a sink overflowing with dirty dishes
that girlfriend of yours aint much for housekeeping is she
early dismisses the place with a glance
im thinking about moving
early opens the refrigerator grabs a bottle of beer
maybe down to texas
probably get some work on them offshore oil rigs
hear the pays good
hell the weathers got to be bettern here
early sits down at the table
the parole officer steps over to him
what are you talking about
you know you cant leave the state
hiccup what you can do is get a job
the parole officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt pocket sets it on the table
you be at this personnel office friday three oclock sharp
what is it
come on i dont want no janitor job
early lifts his beer for another drink
the parole officers prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer bottle just inches from earlys lips
hey i dont give two shits about what you want or dont want
im telling you to be there friday three oclock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner
with that early looks up at the man almost defiantly then stands up
the parole officer hiccups again
early stares at him for a moment
you oughta think about putting a bag over your head
might cure them hiccups
the parole officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out of the trailer to his car
sequence omitted from original script
brians in the midst of working his way through pages and pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk
using chopsticks he shovels chinese straight out of the carton as he studies carries warehouse photographs
as we approach brian from behind moving closer closer
carrie steps up behind him
shes rubbing her eyes having just awakened
a hangover beckons
brian notices her
i didnt have the heart to wake you
what are you doing
well i sat down with my tapes and your photographs which are great by the way
and i started writing
carrie grabs his container of chinese and takes a few bites
so hows it going
i think its the best stuff ive done
carrie glances over his shoulder at his writing
and i think i know why
because i was there
and for a moment that night i understood how she came to pull the trigger
sarcastic this mean your finally going to finish your thesis
look fuck the thesis
i think theres a book here
your photographs and my research together
a book on the warehouse murders
a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america
i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it
brian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the united states up and lays it out on his desk
he traces a route west
along the way specific locations have been circled
what im thinking is we can drop down through tennessee across arkansas and into texas from there its a straight shot into california
pause we dont stop
until we hit the fucking ocean
its about fucking time kessler
id just about given up on you
we dont have enough money but well figure something out
carrie steps up to brian
its either the best idea ive had in a long time
or theres way too much msg in this stuff
brian looks at the container of chinese in his hand
carrie takes it from him sets it down on the road map
early exits the trailer and climbs into his grand prix
early tries to get the engine to tick over
he sees john diebold his landlord emerge from his house and begin lumbering toward the grand prix
the two panting ugly ass pitbulls trot alongside their master
shouts hold on a minute there boy
early tries the engine again
still wont start
diebold getting closer
the dogs are barking
goddamit youre gonna settle up that rent here and now
hurriedly early tries the engine one more time
grinning from ear to ear early pulls away before diebold and his dogs reach him
pissed diebold grabs a rock and hurls it hitting earlys car
the car stops dead in its tracks
ive had it with your bullshit boy
i want my money
early looks in the rear view mirror and sees
diebold standing there confrontational
early throws the gearshift into reverse
tires screeching the car surges toward diebold and the dogs
diebold begins back peddling
confused the pitbulls bark then follow suit
early laughs as he stalks diebold
diebold jumps out of the way of the grand prix just as it pulverizes his portable barbecue
early shifts it into drive and barrels out of the drive
as soon as the grand prix is out of sight
hollering you sonofabitch
come back here
furious he turns to find adele staring at him from the window of her trailer
you tell him
i want you both the fuck out of here by sunday or im gonna call the police
adele starts laughing she tries to hide it with her hand
you wont be laughing come sunday little girl
muttering to himself he turns back toward his house
he then notices what adele is laughing at
one pitbull is trying to hump the other
get the fuck off him
peering out at him from the trailer window laughing at the dogs
brian pulls up in his black lincoln continental
the suicide doors and leather interior have seen better days
brian locks his car and walks into the building
brian steps up to a large bulletin board
he sees several ride share notes to various cities on the board
he pins a ride share note onto the board
we see the note is headlined in red california you know they say one of these days
brian glances over his shoulder
sarcastic the whole things going to slide into the ocean
yeah i know
carol peers over brians shoulder and reads the note
looking for someone to take turns at the wheel and share expenses
on a week long cross country blue highways tour of historic murder sites
beat you gotta be kidding
who in their right mind would want to do that
brian smiles at her and walks away
watching brian walk away like i said
she shakes her head
wheres the personnel office at
carol turns to see early
points down the hall first door on the left
she walks away
earlys eye catches the bulletin board he sees in bold red marker california
adele steps out of the trailer
she walks carefully around the junk piles
its dark hard to see
she comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in
she cant see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging
you down there
the sound of digging stops
from inside the hole whats up adele
after a moments hesitation early resumes his digging
the digging stops again
tell me more about california
the moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her
for one thing
they think faster out there on account of all that warm weather they got cold weather makes people stupid thats a fact
i guess thatd explain why theres so many stupid people around here
yeah and in california you never have to buy fruit cause its all on the trees everywhere you turn
beat and course there aint no speed limit out there and all drugs are legal
and i heard your first months rent is free state law
i figure til we get settled we can just move around month to month
whatll we do out there
the very first thing were gonna do
is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon
early lets out a playful howl as adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon
i read once
aint nothin on that big old moon cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind
that aint right
government sends people there all the time just dont want us to know about it
adele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer
dont be long now dinners bout ready
i heard that
after a moment early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment
we see that hes completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots
early gazes up into the night sky looking at the cold white moon
brian exits loft carrying two bags
carrie is also carrying a bag and smoking a cigarette as they walk to the car
what did he sound like on the phone
kept calling me sir
brian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags
grins i like that
i still think we should have met them first
beggars cant be choosers
they were the only ones who answered the ride share note remember
carrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer
please god were gonna be stuck with these people for a week dont let them be as boring as brians friends
brian throws a needling glance to carrie and slams the car hood shut
they both get into the car brian behind the wheel
he had a real thick accent right outta deliverance
quotes from the movie still
who said anything about a still
get ya ass up in them woods
funny very funny
brian starts the car
it backfires loudly startling carrie
quoting again aintry
this river dont go to aintry
the engine revs again and the lincoln pulls away down the street
pan up from adeles new red high heeled shoes
we hear adele speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice
we shouldnt be doin this early
you leavin the state ridin around with strangers
besides what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered
the camera slowly reveals adele
and the fact that she is alone as she voices her concerns
then from behind her early approaches
just in time to hear
what if theyre dangerous
they aint dangerous adele
startled adele drops her shoulder bag
it lands on top of a couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag all their possessions
a few personal items spill out of it
she kneels down to pick things up
changes subject did you settle things with mr
yeah i left him with the car
were all squared up now
as adele picks up her spilled personal possessions early notices her prized cactus in the bag
he angrily reaches in and grabs it
she reaches for the cactus but misses
what kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse
adele bites her lip almost crying
suddenly early looks past adele to see something adele turns too
the lincoln comes gliding into view
through the windshield we see early
adele by his side
youve got to be kidding me they look like okies
brian honks the horn early waves back
theyve probably got five bucks between them
geez they look kinda weird
you just smile let me do all the talking
how many times you gonna tell me that
smiling at brian as many times as it takes
brian stops the lincoln and gets out
he approaches early and shakes his hand then adeles
hi im brian
early and you must be adele
an awkward moment as everyone just stands there
until brian reaches for adeles bag
let me help you
brian picks up her bag and carries it to the lincoln
adele is instantly won over by the gesture early leery of it
carrie watches as brian and early carry their things to the trunk
carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to zero
when she sits back up adele is standing at her window
hi im adele
she turns away from the window
shyly i like your hair
carrie turns back rolls down window
i said i like your hair
she turns and sees early reflected in the side mirror watching her
he grins at her carrie looks away
brian crams the last of the bags in as early watches
brian looks to him early grins and winks
brian slams the lincoln trunk lid shut
from the blackness
the camera rises from a pile of rubble
as it ascends we reveal diebolds pitbulls howling and digging at a mound of fresh earth where earlys hole used to be
the crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene
deep in the distance the wail of approaching sirens
reveal that its earlys trailer and car that are on fire
flames consume the magazine photos of elvis and priscilla farrah and ryan early and adele
along with them the black and white photo of young early and his mother
on the lincoln as it exits the bus station
the camera descends toward a lone trash can to find there lying amidst the debris inside
the lincoln passes through on its way out of town
brian behind the wheel carrie riding shotgun
early and adele are sitting in the back seat
an awkward silence prevails
brian clears his throat
uh we can stop somewhere if you and adele havent had time for breakfast early
well its like this mr
well its like this bri
i dont eat much in the mornin never have
maybe a beer once in a while lucky lagers my favorite
brian raises his eyebrow a tad but is not really curious about it
its because of what he read in a book once
that folks needin breakfast is a myth or whatever put out by those cereal people
a glance passes between brian and carrie
is she for real
early motions adele not to talk so much
so what do you do early
i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory or i used to
one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin from all them mirrors he broke
beat four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off
after he dies hell have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over
adele and early show no sign of understanding the word
beat you know if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you
that french aint it
carrie glances at the odometer on the dash
the first mile clicks over
everyone takes a last look at the familiar countryside
carrie is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and the gloomy grey sky beyond
adele watches carrie intrigued by the obvious skill carrie shows with the camera
brian glances into the rear view mirror at adele
so adele did early happen to mention the places well be stopping at
on adeles reflection in mirror
then early leans in front of her
yeah bri i did
adele leans against carries front seat
to carrie are you takin the pictures
is it hard to learn
early pulls adele back toward the back seat
to brian you gonna talk to the people who did those murders
thats a good idea
unfortunately most of them have been executed
lincoln drives off down the highway
police and firemen sift through the smoking ruins of earlys trailer
the parole officer pulls up in his car he gets out and approaches a police officer
who are you
his parole officer
right i talked to you on the phone
they say its a torch job that sound like your boy
where would we find him
hell if i know crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas
without his car
we see the smoldering remains of earlys grand prix
in the background diebolds pitbulls are being dragged away by a dog wrangler
what about the owner of the house
reads from note pad this john diebold any idea where he might be
no but i can tell you hes not gonna be too happy about this
from inside earlys hole we hear a voice call out
parole officer and police officer turn back toward the trailer as people rush to the site
the camera aerials down past those gathering around the freshly dug hole to
a laborer standing at the bottom of the pit
alongside his shovel we see that a mans arm has been unearthed
the police and parole officer join several others standing there
thatd be my guess
looks like somebody cut off his ring finger
well now id say thats the least of mr
the two men look to one another
as others begin to unearth the body
close up diebolds ring on a hand twisting open a bottle cap
pull back to reveal that it is early as he opens a bottle of lucky lager beer and takes a sip
on the back seat between them sits a brown paper bag
adele reaches into the bag and pulls out a cheap pocket camera
excitedly she rips open the box and pulls out the camera
she leans over and kisses early
early reaches in the bag and pulls out a small plastic bottle of mineral water and an orange juice
all right who gets the
cant pronounce name water
carrie turns around early hands her the water
early leans forward and hands brian the orange juice
here you go bri
got a couple a bags of chips and some jerky just holler if you want some
then early reaches past brian to the rear view mirror and hangs a plastic st
christopher statue around it
how much do i owe you
adele struggles to understand the camera instructions on the side of the box
she leans forward and shows carrie her camera
embarrassed guess i dont know the first thing about cameras
carrie deliberates her response for a moment then
well the first thing
is you need film
preferably black and white
carrie pulls a roll of film out of her bag and takes adeles camera to load
you wouldnt have any color film would ya
she pulls a roll of color film out of her camera bag and quickly snaps it into the camera
i like things in color pink purple and red
i dunno black and white is kinda
carrie points the camera at a smiling adele and snaps the first picture
you just aim and press the button
adele takes the camera
adele focuses her camera at the scenery out the side window of the car
look pigeon forge
road sign to pigeon forge
adele leans out the side rear window to get a better view
ive heard of that
its where dolly parton has her park
i just think thats so clever
with that she plops back down into the back seat
under his breath shush adele
early can we stop there
just for a little while
as we see the car disappearing into the distance we can still hear adele rambling on
ive always wanted to go there
it could be such fun
the lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox with the name baxter on it
the lincoln turns into the long driveway
brian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder
the novaks are all gone but the fence that michael zaruba was hired to put up is still here
he glances to carrie who fires off several photos of the fence and yard
the lincoln continues slowly down the long drive
up ahead through the windshield brian sees a beautiful old farm house
the novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own
the lincoln slows to a halt
carrie and brian exit the car and begin walking toward the house
adele uncertain about whats transpiring trails behind
hey you two
brian and carrie turn to see
adele training a camera on them
give me a smile now
brian and carrie look to one another then force a weak smile
early jumps in and throws a pair of devils horns up behind brians unsuspecting head as
the shutter clicks
brian and carrie quickly turn their attention back on the house
continues into tape recorder neighbors said he was a quiet young man who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set
an unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard
to the side of the house are the remains of an old swing set
carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set with the house in the background snap
she fires off a shot
continuing everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for michael and had to ask him to leave
as carrie frames up another shot early crosses in front of her camera
realizing he is in carries photo he stops and poses
carrie looks to brian
could you step out the way for a second
early is surprised that they dont want him in the photograph
he wanders away from the front of the house
meanwhile adele photographs the moment
the first one to die was the nine year old daughter
a nine year old girl comes running from around the side of the house
she stops dead when she sees all of them
carrie snaps a final photo
the little girl scans all their faces
my names brian whats yours
the little girl remains silent
brian rolls a look to carrie then back to the little girl
could i speak to your parents
after an awkward pause the little girl silently crosses the yard to the porch and opens the front door
theres more of them
looking into the house through a kitchen window we can see into the entrance hall and through to the open front door
brian waits outside on the porch as the little girl enters the house looking for her father
inside the kitchen right next to the window is a side table with a telephone and a purse on it
earlys reflection appears in the window he has obviously seen the purse
brian motions for carrie to join him
adele watches brian and carrie for a moment then loses interest
she stands on the seat of the swing and begins swinging
early tries to push up the kitchen window
it barely lifts three inches before jamming
through the room we see the little girl and her father step to the front door
a middle aged farmer with tanned leathery skin
he is not happy
brian extends his hand
friendly hi my name is brian kessler
the father says nothing and does not respond to the extended hand
brian retracts his hand
continues less confident im a writer im working on a book about famous murderers
adele swings higher
her summer dress ripples in the wind
a smile on her face
earlys entire arm is through the opening
his shoulder presses against the window pane
but still he cant reach the purse
so he grabs the tablecloth and begins pulling it toward him
the purse slides closer inch by inch
all the while he keeps one eye on the farmer across the room
earlys pov across the room the farmers back is turned to the kitchen as he listens silently to brian
im sure youre aware that this is the novak house
adele swings even higher
shes lost in the moment
corrects himself i mean this was the novak house
pause with your permission id like to come in and photograph
before brian can finish the man slams the door in his face
the farmer turns away from the front door
muttering goddamned ghouls
we see that early and the purse have gone
brian is surprised
he just stands there a moment
hes not sure whether to knock again
the empty swing sways back and forth
brian and carrie walk back to the car
upset we could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes
hey i got some great stuff
brian continues on in a huff until carrie breaks stride and stops
she pulls him next to her
brian glances back at the house
she interrupts his glance kisses him
continuing on the heel of the kiss that house is part of american history now whether he likes it or not
they enter the car
forget about it bri
i wouldnt be surprised if that karma thing dont come back and get him
carrie surprised at earlys new found philosophical belief
she looks into her side view mirror
and sees early smiling back at her
carrie looks away
shifts from the mirror to the house in the background
as the car pulls out of the driveway the little girl watches from her porch
sequence omitted from original script
a small roadside diner
a fair number of people inside having dinner
adele early carrie and brian are seated at one of the tables
carrie watches early eat with a kind of horrible rude fascination
he has no table manners at all
he eats with his elbows on the table fork wedged in the fist of his right hand
all the while he chews with his mouth open
hes serious about his eating
studying his map well weve come three hundred miles so far
not a bad days haul
early doesnt bother to respond
he keeps eating
you got any family or friends in california early
with a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate
earlys foot itches
he tries to scratch it but it doesnt do any good
how bout you carrie
as brian folds up the map
early takes off his boot then his well worn sock
carries look of disgust grows as early brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he eats
carrie puts her fork down dinner is over for her
well least we got each other
brian looks up sees carries expression
then whats causing it
early mops up the last bit of food on his plate
he notices brian and carrie staring at him and slowly puts his foot back down on the floor then the sock
brian picks up the check to see the total
starts pulling his wallet out
isnt quite sure how to bring up the tab to early
thanks bri ill get the next one
prompts adele think its time we hit the sack
early winks at brian carrie catches the wink
early and adele get up and head for the door
adele waves goodnight
to carrie sweet dreams
close on carrie she is reflected in a mirror
reveal carrie wearing only a t shirt is at the vanity angrily brushing her teeth
in the bathroom next to her a bath is running
in the adjacent bedroom brian is in the bed working on his notes
spits out a mouthful of water you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while im eating im prejudiced
reading notes he cant help the way he was raised
i kinda feel sorry for him
carrie pauses in brushing her teeth
feel sorry for him
obviously you didnt get a whiff of that sock
bitch bitch bitch
under her breath up yours
i heard that
carrie finishes brushing her teeth
secretively she gives brian the finger
heard that too
carrie glances at the bath water running in the tub
its rusty brown and disgusting
she pulls the plug on the bath idea
the tap is running at the sink as early empties the stolen purse
he adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash
can you believe thirty bucks for this room
a lumpy mattress that crummy tv and a crapper
early sing me a song
early continues to sift through all the items from the purse
adele starts to sing a song
early start sing with her
as the song ends
laughs hey can we go to that chinese restaurant when we get to los angeles
you know to see all them famous footprints
early reaches down into the bottom of the purse and pulls out a pair of glistening stainless steel scissors
only if they let me put mine down too
he stares at the scissors curiously then switches off the bathroom light
look carrie were gonna be stuck with these people for a week
click a light is turned on
brian has turned on the nightstand light
he and carrie are lying in bed
and all im saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them
you try im gonna pretend theyre with somebody else
i dont want to talk about it
brian turns the light off
from the blackness
pretty smooth how he stiffed us on dinner
brian switches the light back on
he didnt stiff us
he paid for the gas remember
brian reaches out for the light
when im telling you hes nearly broke and were going to end up paying for those two
brian decides to leave the light on
he moves closer to carrie
he slides up against her backside
he reaches for her under the sheets
kisses her neck
carrie pushes her body up against his in response
brians mouth moves down along her back
he slips beneath the sheets
from the expression on her face she obviously approves
yet she cant resist slipping in another remark
funky fucking sock
carrie rolls over on her back
brian moves on top of her
kisses her stomach
and whats with that hair
is that grease or motor oil or what
carrie reaches down and grabs two fists full of brians hair
she pulls him to her
he slides up along her chest kissing her
things heat up
she reaches out grasps his arms
pulls him closer
you believe that tattoo
looks like he had another girls name there and carved it out
brian bites at her neck
she stops talking
his sweating shoulder presses against her face
she turns her head to encourage him
in the dresser mirror
she sees their shadowy reflections
their bodies atangle under the sheets
and that body odor
their reflection in the mirror intrigues her
his aggression excites her
she pulls him into her
the metal bedframe bangs against the motel wall repeatedly as they make love
then slowly the camera bisects the plaster and lumber divider and emerges in the next room
early leaning quietly against the same wall
listening to them
as he does he uses the scissors to cut through the crusty bandage on his finger
then across the room he notices adele in bed asleep
the scissors stop
sequence omitted from original script
early exits his motel room opens a bottle of lucky lager against a soda dispenser and walks over to the motel diner
early enters the diner drinking his morning beer
adele is not with him
he spots brian and carrie seated opposite one another in one of the booths
he walks up to their table and drops down uninvited on the seat next to carrie
early lifts his beer bottle in salute
she wasnt feeling so good
the waitress arrives with a menu offers it to early
dont eat breakfast
the waitress notices earlys bottle of beer
she gets earlys attention
concerned we ah
dont have a liquor license here
so im afraid
well dont be i got plenty more where this one came from
the waitress gives him a curious look and walks away
just then brian look past early
a surprised expression crosses brians face
early turns to see
adele approaching the table
her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble carries
it looks like shit
at a loss for words you cut your hair
adele smiles pleased with carrie for noticing
she sits down next to brian
early cut it
smiles at early once he gets an idea in his head theres no holding him back
carrie looks to brian curiously
adele is distracted by a small cactus on the window near the table
nice job early
carrie notices adeles new stolen purse
we see the wheels turning in carries head
sequence omitted from original script
early walks toward the lincoln
it is parked outside brian and carries room
the front door is ajar he pushes it open
he sees carries reflection in the bathroom mirror shes in her underwear pulling on her jeans
early watches her for a moment
theres no mistaking whats on his mind
as his eyes scan her body
carrie pulls on her t shirt steps out of the bathroom and sees early just outside the door
need a hand with those bags
no thanks i can manage
carrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few things
she glances into the dresser mirror looking for earlys reflection at the door but hes gone
relieved she turns the corner to grab her bags and finds early standing right there
looking at her
he startles her
i got em
he picks up her bags and walks out of the room
carrie watches him then she steps to the doorway
take your time
early places the bags in the lincolns trunk
adele sees early carrying carries bag adele looks jealous
in the foreground carries door closes
lincoln passes through frame
brian at wheel carrie next to him loading her camera
early in the back seat adele next to him pulls out some make up from her bag we see the little cactus from the motel lobby
she begins to put on some lipstick
early reaches into the frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between brian and carrie
starts to read this the book your writing
its just a work in progress kinda rough
this guy killed a mess of people
henry lee lucas
well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred
wonder what all them people done made him so mad
brian looks to early in his rear view mirror
the front tire blows
the car lurches
brian reacts pulling the lincoln to the side of the road in a dusty halt
brian and early unload the trunk to get to the spare tire
brian struggles with the wheel and the jack
here bri let me do that
early takes over
he pulls off his shirt jacks the car up and begins replacing the wheel with ease
how did he get away with it for so long anyhow
he almost always killed strangers
spent years moving on from one place to another
that made it real hard to track him down
carrie scans the landscape with her camera
she sees adele walking around a small roadside graveyard
she is reading the epitaphs on the headstones
carrie fires off a few shots
then she sees early she cant help but notice earlys lean body
she zooms in on his muscles and prison tattoo
early completes the task
together he and brian begin putting everything back in the trunk
suddenly from behind adele jumps onto earlys back surprising him
he gives her a horsey ride around the lincoln
she notices earlys wallet on the ground
shes riding him covering his eyes playfully
she picks up the wallet
earlys feet galloping
she opens the wallet to find two one dollar bills inside
as they come around the side of the car and to a stop in front of carrie
she holds up his wallet
watches his eyes
you dropped this
early grayce if this aint your lucky day
she hands the wallet back to him
something between them goes unspoken
the lincoln pulls in
i guess its your turn to pay early
early nods and brian looks over to carrie making sure she heard
the four of them get out of the car
early starts toward the gas station store
he checks his wallet two dollars left
carrie and adele lean against the car
carrie lights up a cigarette
she watches early to see what his next move will be
brian removes the gas cap and sticks the gas pump nozzle in
it pumps away
it starts turning over
crossing the tarmac
his face expressionless
his mind racing
brian walks around the lincoln checking the tires
carrie watches early intently
he walks toward the entrance
inside the store he sees a video surveillance camera
it worries him
distracts him momentarily
suddenly from behind him
a car horn honks loudly
early turns to see a late model mercedes behind him
he just gazes at the driver
aggravated the driver leans on the horn and motions early out of his way
early stares at the man a moment longer then steps to one side and lets the car pull past him
a fat man in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel of the mercedes
early watches him as he takes a money clip from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini market
the gas meter dial continues to go around
the girls leaning against the car
adele watches carrie take a drag on her cigarette
i used to smoke before i met early
but he broke me of that
her remark gets carries attention
he watches the fat man inside the office
the fat man pays the attendant for gas and is handed the restroom key
brian walks to the front of the lincoln
he passes carrie and adele
early dont think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor
so you dont do any of those things
carrie takes a quick look to the mini market
shes lost sight of early
better not or earlyd whip me
back to adele he whips you
the fat man turns the key and enters the bathroom
the door starts to swing shut behind him but
two fingers catch it before it does
only when i deserve it
brian lifts the hood of the lincoln
reaches for the radiator cap
the fat man is standing at the urinal
he has a ureterostomy bag hes emptying when
earlys hand hits the blow dryer
a whirring sound fills the room
the fat man turns his head
early lunges at him from behind yanks his head back and rips a switchblade across his throat
a blast of steam from the radiator startles brian
the fat man clutches at his throat
sees the blood on his palms
he looks up in shock
early pounds the mans head into the wall
brian checking the oil pulls out the dip stick
black oil runs down the metal blade
the fat man falls to his knees against the urinal
his hand grasping the lever
the urinal flushes
the fat mans blood mixes with it
the urinal overflows
the blood tinged water spills onto the white tile floor
early pries the dead mans fist off the lever
brian slams the lincolns hood shut
early struggles to turn the fat corpse over
brian steps up to the gas nozzle and pulls it out of the car
early reaches in the dead mans pocket and removes his money clip
the gas meter stops turning
early calmly washes his hands in the beat up ceramic sink
he pulls a comb from his pocket and combs his hair in the mirror
brian pulls a squeegee across the front windshield
water washes the dirt away
the bloody water spiralling down the drain hole
early exits the bathroom
and runs straight into brian about to enter
friendly hey bri
you dont want to go in there
its a real mess if you know what i mean
brian glances at the bathroom door
down below a thin stream of the fat mans blood begins to trickle out from under the door
just barely touching the toe of brians shoe
early puts his arm around brian and turns him back toward the car
adele takes a photo of them approaching
the attendant steps up to carrie
to carrie comes to twenty eight dollars
talk to him
carrie points to early
as brian and early approach the car early pulls out the money clip
call it an even thirty
early peels off thirty bucks from the money clip
he sees carrie watching him early smiles
ill drive bri
hearing that carrie climbs into the back seat
adele climbs over the backrest into the frontseat
adele get in the back
she climbs again into the backseat
early is driving
brian riding shotgun is making some notes in his manuscript
adele is teaching a reluctant carrie to play a card game called snap
hey youre good
thought you said you never played before
im a fast learner
they never caught that black dolya killer huh
now why is that
some people think its because he never killed again
he just disappeared back into society
you dont sound too convinced bout that
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer
anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again
until someone stopped him
theory aint that what they call it
you wanna hear mine
carrie listens in as she continues to play cards with adele
aint you goin to record it
brian picks up his tape recorder
into tape early grayce june twenty third
brian hands early the hand held tape recorder
into tape well ill just bet hes still alive
old livin in some trailer park or somethin somewhere but still alive
thinkin every night bout what he done
goin over and over it in his mind
how smart he was for getting away with it
carrie is chilled by the intensity of earlys remark
she watches him out of the corner of her eye
adeles hand hits the pile of cards and she wins the game
startled carrie turns back to adele
to carrie you lose
to early i suppose anythings possible
brian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his notes
the blood encrusted toe of his shoe
you ever play any pool bri
up ahead a honky tonk bar with a large sign pool tables the lincoln passes by the large sign
i can hold my own
a high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below
the motel sign pulses erratically in foreground
moths flicker about the light
the lincoln is parked in front of brian and carries room
the horn honks
early is behind the wheel engine running
brian steps out of the motel room
hey minnesota fats
carrie appears at the door holding her camera
sarcastic dont forget your key
she hands brian the key
whyd i open my big mouth
brian takes the key and walks to the car
carrie sees adele standing outside her door
brian enters the lincoln
to adele why didnt you go with them
the lincoln pulls away
i told you how early feels bout a woman drinking
howd you meet early
carrie swings the camera around to adele and snaps off a shot
grins i was hitchhiking one day and he picked me up
at first i wasnt gonna get in on account of his car was in such sorry shape
i said i aint never seen a white man drivin a car like this
carrie snaps another shot of adele
every once in a while adele feels like she should be posing for the shots that carries taking of her
so occasionally as she carries on her conversation with carrie she does
continues an he said right back you shouldnt judge by appearances little lady
this vehicle might just be a flying saucer disguised as a car for all you know
well i got in and we got to talkin and the next thing i know id moved in with him in this old trailer
wouldnt it be something if we all ended up sharing a house together in california
she lowers the camera from her eye and studies adele
you know i can fix that haircut for you if you want
a nondescript joint on the outskirts of town
american pickup trucks parked outside
the lincoln pulls into foreground and parks
early gets out of the lincoln and looks around
i wonder if theres any doors out here
brian exits the lincoln and looks at early questioning
openings to other dimensions
pause i read there are a lot of them out west mostly in the desert
they say if you know what youre doing you can travel anywhere in the universe in a matter of seconds
wouldnt that come in handy
brian looks at him blankly
he cant think of a thing to say in response
early walks toward the entrance of the bar
brian joins him
by the way im not much of a pool player
shit it aint hard to play pool
i can teach you everything ya need ta know
ill even spot ya a few points first game
wait a minute
youre gonna hustle me
how much money have you got
they both laugh and enter the bar
adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror drinking a beer
carrie is cutting her hair
in the mirror adele watches carrie for a moment
she notices the cigarette dangling from her lips
how do you get your cigarette to stay there like that
carrie looks in the mirror
could i try that
carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to adele
together they stare into the mirror with their dangling cigarettes
adele drops her cigarette as she reaches down for it she notices carries portfolio
its a portfolio of my work
can i see em
adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap
carrie continues to cut adeles hair
adele opens the binder and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the cover back down
carrie watches her in amusement
after a moment adele reconsiders and opens the book
she gazes at the shocking photograph
you took this picture
took em all
carrie resumes cutting adeles hair
adele thumbs through several photographs
no it is not
boy ill tell ya if early found a picture of me like that id be black and blue for a week
adele notices carries scowl in the dresser mirror
carrie stops cutting
suddenly serious you shouldnt let him do that to you
are you serious
defensive you think earlys bad to me dont you
carrie starts cutting adeles hair again
i aint saying early aint never hit me
but he never hurt me
when carrie doesnt respond adele grabs carries scissor hand and stops her from continuing
carrie looks at adeles reflection in the dresser mirror
continues when i was fourteen years old three boys raped me in the back of a truck and beat me so bad i was in bed for almost four months
beat i feel safe with early most the time he treats me pretty good
and i know he wouldnt let nothin like that ever happen to me again
carrie is speechless adele looks in the mirror at her new haircut
hey that aint so bad now
the patrons are young men and women
eighteen to thirty
the rivers edge kids today
ludes and beer
we follow one of the waitresses through the bar
as she passes by a pool table one of the players a large young cracker makes a grab at her
when you gonna give me so o that
she spins safely out of his reach
maybe when you grow up a little sonny
some guys close enough to hear her over the noise laugh at her put down
she moves on until she reaches
brian standing near a small high table
earlys not with him
she sets four beers down on the table
brian tries to talk to her over the music
he leans in close
his mouth to her ear
these arent lucky lager i ordered lucky lager
sorry honey aint nothin lucky around here
the waitress laughs
brian smiles and glances around the room
he notices the large young cracker staring at him
early steps out of the bathroom and makes his way back to brian
he watches the waitress disappear into the crowd then turns to find the large young cracker in his face
what did you say to her city boy
the young cracker is obviously very drunk
nothing i jus
cuts him off whats a jism gargling cum drunk fairy like you looking at a pretty girl like that for anyway
the young cracker doesnt notice early return from the bathroom
he moves in next to brian
early is relaxed and nonchalant as he looks over the young cracker
he leans closer to brian
matter of factly youd better hit him first bri cos its comin
with his eyes on brian early grabs a beer
brian is scared and confused with one ear and one eye on the young cracker the other on early
this yur boyfriend
early looks at the beer
angry bri this shit aint lucky lager
early takes a swig off the beer grimaces and sprays it out
it hits the young cracker
the cracker looks down at his shirt in shock
early is oblivious
to early hey asshole
brian is frozen confused doesnt know who to address
early continues to ignore the young cracker
they dont stock it here early
to early furious why you fuckin
the young cracker moves to hit early
early swiftly smashes his beer bottle into the oncoming face
the young cracker doubles over clutching his face in agony
early kicks him in the face sending the young cracker to the ground
early finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work boots
two large tough guys approach early and brian
brians heart racing early cool as a cucumber
instead of taking on early they stop reach down and drag the unconscious man away
the waitress returns to their table
sorry about that hes always causing trouble
she sets down two beers and two shots doubles
these are on the house
sequence omitted from original script
carrie and adele split the last bottle of beer between them
they are sitting on the floor and adele has carries foot in her lap
shes painting carries toenails bright red
neither of them is feeling any pain
my mommas a beautician

adele hastily weaves her way out the door
carrie stares down at her feet
cottonballs between the toes
sequence omitted from original script
early and brian exit the bar
they make their way to the lincoln
on the way

brian looks at early doesnt understand

early branches off behind the car
any reebs left in the back seat
early starts to take a leak
relief thats what we used to call a beer when we was kids
beer spelled backwards
brian reaches in the back seat and grabs the last lucky lager
he crosses to the other side of the car and hands early the beer
early stares at the last of the lucky lagers
well i probably drunk more than my share anyway

so i close my eyes figurin ill count ten and itll be gone right
so im countin
he closes his eyes
an im bout ta piss myself right
an i open my eyes slow spectin it wont be there right
when early opens his eyes he sees a concerned look on brians face
unconvincingly and it wasnt
an awkward silence
then early starts laughing
brian follows suit
they both climb back in the car
their forced laughter trails off
brian shifts the lincoln back into gear and segues awkwardly
what were you swinging a sickle for
early stares at brian
for a moment brian is unsure what early will say or do
then early grins
bout three years
brian brakes their eye contact looks back out onto the highway and just drives off
sequence omitted from original script
the door opens revealing brian silhouetted in the doorway
under the influence of lucky lager he fumbles with the key
gets inside and noisily shuts the door behind him
carrie remains stonily silent in the dark
gotta see a man about a mule
a few seconds pass
the same thing thats been wrong the whole trip
your good buddy early
carrie in bed switches on the side table light
reveals brian leaning on the wall trying to get his shoes off without falling over
who said hes my good buddy
you sure been acting like you were
redneck accent out whoopin it up a drankin and ever thang
brian points to the empty beer bottles on the table
hey come on you two were drinking too
so whats the big deal
brian throws his shoes somewhere and heads toward the bathroom
yeah and you shouldve seen how terrified she was that hed find out
he beats her
how do you know that
she told me
adding but only when she deserves it
did you know he was in jail
brian turns on the light
takes a piss
a long one
yeah for stealing a car
suddenly from right behind him bullshit
startled brian turns to see carrie
he told her it was for carrying a gun but the truth could be murder for all we know
no response from brian
carrie walks away
carrie steps over to the bed pulls the sheets back
brian leans out the bathroom door stop being so fucking melodramatic
if it was murder hed still be locked up or on parole in which case he wouldnt be allowed to leave the state
maybe he wasnt allowed to leave
brian smacks himself on the forehead a sarcastic how stupid of me
he pulls his shirt off over his head and admits
sarcastically of course
the accent the clothes and those table manners
hes got to be a mass murderer
pause what else could he be
he switches off the bathroom light steps out of the doorway and begins to pull his jeans off
carrie climbs into bed
you know it wouldnt even surprise me if he turned out to be
brian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed
carrie switches off the the only light in the room
in the dark we hear a thud as brian trips over a chair
my fucking toe
carrie leaves the motel room ice bucket in hand
to brian inside room try not to lose consciousness til i get back
at the far end of a narrow hallway carrie finds an ice machine rumbling away noisily
the only illumination a single fluorescent light bulb hangs suspended above it
with her arm buried inside the ice machine carrie scavenges for what little ice there is
when out of the corner of her eye she notices
someone standing at the other end of the corridor
the silhouette of a man
her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for another way out
there is none
she tries to ignore the situation
grabs another handful of ice cubes
the man approaches
carrie stops again
her mind races
the mans face slowly becomes visible as he nears the fluorescent light
aint you done enough drinking for tonight
brian hurt his foot
early reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a solitary cube
he puts it in his mouth sucks on it
his torso is drenched in sweat
he catches carrie staring at him
dont know why it is
i get so hot i cant stand it
i just start sweating like a dog
you ever get like that
early spits the ice cube back into his hand
he presses it against the back of his neck
i can feel it start to run down my neck
he turns his back to show her and down my back
right into my pants
carrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between his shoulder blades and along his back
and everything starts stickin together
keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin for my boots see who gets there first
he snaps a look back to carrie and finds her looking at his ass
she diverts her glance
you never get that hot huh
carrie shakes her head no
early looks in his hand to see that his ice cube has melted
i gotta get back before this ice melts
carrie tries to slip past him
he reaches back into the machine momentarily blocking her exit
he grabs another ice cube
his face only inches from hers
he pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass
you like skynard
no response early chews up the ice cube
sequence omitted from original script
the car crawls out of the parking lot
carrie is driving
brian is contending with a major hangover
there is still a silent tension between brian and carrie from the argument the night before
early is in the back with adele
brian moves his head and moans
my daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover mixed in one egg not two and some tomato juice
from the front seat brians hand springs up in a desperate plea for an end to adeles colorful description
im okay thanks
brian rolls down his window for some fresh air as the car pulls away
carrie glances over at brian who is now asleep next to her
she looks up into her rear view mirror
early is asleep leaning against the door
adele is rummaging through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her
the wail of an approaching ambulance gets carries attention
it roars by
carrie glances in the mirror again
the next instant unexpectedly
she furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt
brians heads bangs against the side window
carrie nods toward the back seat
brian turns and sees adele looking back at them questioningly
beside her early rustles
what is it
brian notices that adeles rummaging has revealed an automatic pistol in the open canvas bag
brian stares at it
earlys eyes open
a deserted plain
its very quiet here
until the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots
reveal early teaching brian how to shoot
a row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old car
its obvious that brians enthralled with the idea of shooting the gun
even if he isnt hitting anything
only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn
brian fires off another shot misses again
bri youre jerkin it when you pull the trigger hold it real steady
nearby stands an unhappy carrie
adele pulls her yoyo out of her pocket
boysll be boys
carrie doesnt respond
adele offers the yoyo to carrie
you know any tricks
carrie shakes her head no
adele withdraws her offer
you wanna learn some
again carrie declines
her steely gaze returns to brian
early helps brian to hold the gun
now let half of it out and
the can flies off the tree stump
brian turns to carrie to see her reaction
but shes already on her way back to the car and shes furious
concerned brian starts to follow after her
but early grabs his attention
bri i want you to keep this gun
consider it a present
never know california could turn out to be a dangerous place
brian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand
the lincoln rolling along
brian is driving
carrie keeps to herself
in her side mirror she catches a glimpse of early curled up in adeles lap
she watches a moment longer
and realizes that they are making out
beginning to kiss and touch one another
the lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road
in the distance we see a large rundown building
the lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure
brian glances to the back seat to make a remark to early and adele and sees that they are amorously engaged
brian and carrie start to gather their stuff
carrie opens the glove compartment inside are boxes of film
and the automatic
she takes a few packs of film and closes the glove compartment
tell ya bri
im still a little sleepy
think adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta
pissed off siesta
carrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition locks the glove compartment and pockets the key
both she and brian exit the car
as they start to walk toward the structure brian hears a sound he turns back to see
adele leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincolns big white top starts to come up
even in daylight the interior of the dilapidated old building is equal parts unnerving austere and menacing
the last rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows
the light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat hooks hanging from the ceiling
carrie is getting her camera equipment ready
shes quiet and uncommunicative
close on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room
brian pops a cassette in the player
a copy of a tape they found
he recorded everything
camera in hand carrie begins to move about despite the fact that this place repels her
brian presses a button on the audio cassette player
the small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman being tortured and pleading for her life
carrie fires off a series of shots from different angles
brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened
screams from the audio tape bounce off the walls
speaks into his small hand held tape recorder his mother had him working in here before he was eight years old
killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was
brian and carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into another room
when she was pissed at him shed beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight
the pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady whimpering
continuing eventually the boy wakes up one morning picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back
carrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior
then she stops turns and walks out of the room
shes had enough
brian follows after her
carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear
i know youre pissed off about the gun and i dont blame you
carrie wheels around to face him
brian im not pissed off
god damm it turn that thing off
she switches off the cassette player
a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun
this afternoon youre out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow for christs sake
whats with you
okay it was a cheap thrill it was stupid i admit it alright
pause but lets not blow this
lets just get the photos
i cant believe i agreed to do this
oh come on dont give me that shit
you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too
i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california
theres a big difference
carrie storms out of the place
she exits the tunnel and makes her way toward
as she approaches it through the rear windshield she sees
early and adele fucking wildly
carrie wants to turn away but she cant stop watching them
fascinated she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on them
early is sitting against the back seat
adele is straddling him
carries finger finds the shutter button
earlys arms move up under adeles dress
her hands press up against the roof
carries finger presses down on the button click
then in one swift movement early sweeps adele onto the back seat
close on earlys face
talking dirty to adele
keeping her finger on the button carrie rapid fires through a whole roll of film
shes oblivious to the whine of the motor drive once all the film is shot out
early looks directly into the camera at carrie
and continues to fuck adele
a chill rushes through carrie she almost drops the camera
she runs back toward the tunnel
and right into brians arms
he startles her
she pulls away from him
brian i want him out of our car
why what did he do
brian get him out of the car
next gas station either he leaves or i do
the lincoln passes through frame
in the background the surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie artificial light
an electrical storm is in full swing
the lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before carrie storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station interior
she leaves brian to break the news to adele and early
the only person inside is a young male attendant
hes watching tv behind the counter as carrie enters
on the tv we see a newsman
we only catch fragments of what he is saying because the storm outside is affecting the tv reception
twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of cigarettes
in fact each time the lightning flashes occur all of the electrical power at the station is affected
the fluorescent lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter sporadically
the ex mental patient with a history of arrests is still at large
carrie looks at the tv watches for a moment
it doesnt hold her attention
she looks away and notices adele leaving the car
adele walks toward a coke machine at the other end of the gas station
heres your cigarettes
carrie turns back toward him
better be careful looks like a bad one coming
where you headin
hear it never rains there
must be nice
he buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to gas up the lincoln
carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from the carton nervously lights one up
she looks out the window toward the lincoln
through flashes of lightning and thunder she sees brian in the car talking to early
early listening quietly
brian looking adamant yet apologetic
the attendant fills the lincolns tank
simultaneously as carrie watches this
behind her on the tv screen
a wave of interference scrambles the picture
we would like to repeat
there is a nationwide manhunt for
the static clears and the newscaster appears
is believed responsible for the murders of his landlord john diebold
brians still talking using his hands to explain
early is watching him with a resigned expression
a video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a surveillance camera
of the fatal stabbing and robbery of mr
joseph davies robbins
she stares at the tv with growing horror as she notices a familiar black lincoln in the background
in mid ground a male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly
slowly earlys image becomes visible
if you see this man
carrie panics turns toward the door and runs smack into the arms of a dripping wet early grayce
early stares at her and drops his bag to the ground
i aint ridin in no bus
early notices himself on the tv
call your local police or fbi
early grabs carrie around the neck and yanks her into the back office
he pushes her down onto a chair
you just sit there and keep your mouth shut
he searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed off shotgun
he shuts the tv off
i knew that boyd have a hogleg here somewhere
the attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain
early points the sawed off shotgun at him
get over here
early forces him into the office
sit your ass down in that corner
adele enters the adjacent room
she checks out the various vending machines in search of candy
early taps on the window and motions her into the office
she sees carrie in the chair scared to death and early aiming the gun at the attendant
early whatre you doin
go back to the car and keep brian there
i dont want him in here
beat do it adele
adele looks back at carrie then hurries out
early empties the cash register
whats your name boy
very scared walter livesy
i might just have to kill you walter
how do you feel about that
not so good
you sure you have to
i dont know
wish i did
early just think
shut your mouth
adele opens the door on the drivers side looking scared
brian is in the passenger seat
hes looking in the glove compartment for a map
automatic early gave brian is clearly visible
adele stares at it
adele what are you doing back here
adele gets in and starts looking under the seats
lost my purse
could you help me look for it
its probably under the seat
the attendant is reaching up handing early the money from his pockets
carrie is seated in front of him
where you from walter
nervous shake vernon florida
never heard of it any huntin
turkeys are real smart
smarter than most people think
early rips the phone out of the wall
tell you what walter you lie down there now
you make sure you stay put for a while after we leave
the attendant nods yes
mind if i hold that bible
what do you need a bible for
the attendant has no response
you think im goin to kill you
well thatd make me a liar then wouldnt it
early takes the bible off the desk and hands it down to the attendant
here you go
the frightened young man lies face down on his stomach clutching the bible and starts to pray
on the counter next to him early notices a large stuffed happy face display
free with every gallon purchase
he grabs one stares at its face curiously
mumbles to himself i wonder if adele would like one of these
he puts the barrel of the gun between the happy face eyes
points it at the back of the attendants head
carrie begins to scream
early pulls the trigger
the blast explodes the happy face and rips into the back of the attendants head killing him
a thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot
the rain starts pouring down
what was that
adele stares blankly back
the room fills with billowing down stuffing
as the stuffing floats to the floor it sticks to their hair skin and clothes
surprised at the feathers what the fuck
brian opens the door to leave
early drags carrie out of the office toward the car
brian sees them running toward the car
they spill into the back seat
brian sees carrie is upset
carrie whats wrong
to early early we went through this already you have to leave
from the back seat early wipes some more feathers from his face then points the attendants gun at brians head
spits out a feather fraid not bri
adele starts the car
she pulls out of the station and into the rainstorm
the last of the feathers fall like snow
the whole room is now white except for a red stain around the head of the dead attendant
the car moves down the highway
early in the back seat is still trying to brush away feathers
hate to be an indian giver but im gonna have to ask for my gun back
brian reaches in the glove compartment
he removes the gun and hands it to early
to early what happened back there
carrie sits in the corner of the back seat covered in feathers but not even noticing them
he shot him in the head
adele turns to the back of the car to face carrie
raising her voice he did not you liar
take that back
the lincoln swerves off onto the side of the road
adele looks to the front again and steers it back onto the highway
hes a killer brian
hes fucking insane
everybody just shut up
early picks some more feathers off himself
you two just cooperate and do what i say and well all arrive safe and sound in california as planned
unless of course adele dont kill us first with her driving
christopher statue swings from the rear view mirror
the windshield wipers sweep back and forth against the pouring rain
the lincoln pulls up at the rear of the store
adele exits carrying a couple of bags of chinese take out food
adele enters the decrepit store
the others are inside
brian and carrie are tied up
brian watches early intently as he takes one of the bags from adele
he begins opening one of the carry out containers
what the hell is this stuff
its chinese food
it was the only place open
you said you was starving youd eat anyth
early opens another container
stares curiously at the contents
yeah but what is it
i dont know they didnt speak too good english
early sets the container down
and just what exactly are the chinese doing here in the middle of the american desert anyway
didja get the beer
adele somewhat reluctantly hands early a bottle of beer from a second bag
early notices that brian is watching him intently
he mistakes brians interest for hunger
oh hell im sorry bri
adele honey untie brian hes starving over there
pause carrie you want some
carrie doesnt respond at all
adele unties brian
early pulls out his gun puts it on the table next to him
brian sits across from early
he watches as early rummages impatiently through the carry out paraphernalia
wheres the damn forks and spoons at
frustrated early finally takes a gulp of chinese food right out of the container
it goes down rough
is it just me or has this whole trip been goin downhill ever since we ran outta lucky lager
brian picks up a pair of chopsticks then reconsiders puts them back down and like early gulps from the container
nearby carrie sits quietly
as she listens to the two men talk
she notices something on her arm
she lifts her arm up to get a closer look
she sees that a few of the white down feathers still cling to her
and she sees that one of the tiny feathers is tinged with blood
the gas station attendants
it freaks her
quietly how many people have you killed early
thinks for a moment
she tries to brush the bloodied feather away
but with her hands bound she cant reach it
well now how many people dyou see me kill
brian shakes his head
in quiet desperation she raises her arm to her lips
and blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away
early stares at brian
well then thats how many i killed
unconvincingly if you say so
damn right i do
adele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor
early picks up a different container and gulps some down
after a moment
you never killed anyone have you bri
brian shakes his head no
you never even seen anybody killed right
brian stops eating and looks at early
what are you getting at
early leans closer to him
you wanna tell me hown the hell you gonna write a book bout somethin you dont know nothin bout
eye to eye the two men stare at one another
brian has no answer
ya see what im sayin
nervously mimes the same ha
early goes back to gulping down his dinner
this time he gets a spicy one
a nod toward the carry out container watch out for that stuff it bites
brian gazes at the cluster of chinese carry out food containers
an ironic reminder of an earlier conversation
he lets out a weak ironic laugh
recollecting to himself way too much msg
early is behind the wheel not a care in the world
adele sits beside him playing with her camera
she turns and aims the camera at brian and carrie in the back seat their hands are bound
neither makes any attempt at smiling
adele snaps their photo anyway
in the front seat she sits quietly for a moment then leans over to early and whispers something to him
i guarantee you he was breathing when i walked outta there
adele sits back quietly
carrie wants to speak but doesnt
aint we getting near the next murder site
forget about it doesnt matter
hell it dont
beat hand me brians map there adele
one day im gonna pass some store and see your book in the window
me and adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table
carrie silently fuming in the back seat
brian stares at the rope that binds his wrists
the lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops
they all get out early unties brian and carrie
figured your hands might be starting to hurt
early looks down the hill to the old mine building
lets have a look
you girls coming
carries steely gaze answers earlys question
can i just wait here
early leans into the car and picks up adeles camera
dont worry bri ill take the pictures
to adele with a kiss to her cheek you stay here with carrie
to carrie you run off
bri pays the price
pistol in hand early follows brian down the hill
adele begins nervously playing with her yoyo
carrie watches as brian and early disappear around a bend in the dirt road
out of the corner of her eye she hones in on adeles yoyo
adele becomes increasingly intense about manipulating the yoyo controlling it
until shes lost in it
a momentary refuge
this is called walk the dog
a huge excruciatingly tight shot of the yoyo in slow motion
its string unraveling as it spins downward
carrie pulls her gaze away
the desolate surrounding landscape a bright blue sky the scrubbrush
and no one who can help them
carrie turns and looks over her shoulder down the hill
the old mine building rusted and deserted since the late s
so tell me
what happened here
two brothers prospectors lived here
up until a few years back
early takes a photo with the instamatic
they picked up hitchhikers
and brought them back here
early scans the grounds
whered they do it
reluctantly brian leads early toward the old mine building
at the opening early hesitates
brian stops in his tracks
adeles yoyo skitters across the gravel road surface
brian turns back to early
this aint going to give me nightmares is it
then in a snap
the yoyo recoils into adeles palm
a distant empty ribbon of road
her eyes searching for anyone who could help
this is one of my favorites
rock the cradle
brian and early are silhouetted against the dying sky
early takes another photo
they asked them just before they were executed why they did it
they said to be famous
beat why do you do it
early takes a flash photo of brian momentarily blinding him
do what bri
early moves slowly toward brian
we both know you didnt have to kill that gas station attendant
brians eyes dart nervously to the gun dangling in earlys palm
in slow motion adeles hands manipulate the yoyo and string
you wanted to
early remains silent as he closes in on brian
it make you feel good
come on early tell me something
were you angry
earlys boot lands toe to toe with brians shoe
tentative who are you angry with early
your mother your father
eye to eye the two men stand there
you want to know about my daddy ill tell you about my daddy bri
carrie walks over to adele at the car
adele doesnt miss a beat with her yoyo
adele listen to me
earlys sick he should be in a hospital
adele screws up the trick
she pulls the yoyo off her finger and throws it in the back seat
she leans into the front seat and cranks the radio up to the max
closing her eyes she begins moving to the music and tries to ignore carrie
shouting over the music the police are after him hes a murderer
uncertain thats not true
shouting back thats not true
a police car pulls into frame unnoticed by carrie and adele in the background
lets take a look
ill call in the plate
the male officer exits unlocking his holster
the female officer picks up the police radio and calls in the license plate number
the radio is blaring
adele continues to dance despite carries pleas
shouting i wouldnt lie to you adele
i saw him kill that man
defensive early didnt kill nobody he wouldnt do that
i dont know why youre saying those things
you aint my friend
with that adele stops her dancing and turns away from carrie
to see the male officer walking toward them
please dont say anything carrie
the male officer continues toward them
it looks like hes talking to them
but his voice is inaudible under the deafening radio
the female officer sticks her head out of the police car and yells to her partner
he turns to listen
we got a match ill call for back up
as the male officer turns back he sees adele reach into the front seat of the lincoln
the male officer draws his revolver and levels it at adele
adele shuts the radio off total silence
as adele leans back out of the car she turns facing directly into the barrel of the male officers gun
all right ladies i want both of you to slowly step away from the ca
a single gunshot rings out
the male officer jerks back and falls to the ground
carrie whips a panicked glance around and sees
early running toward them
brian bewildered follows behind
ahead of him he watches early race past the wounded male officer
he kicks the officers revolver out of reach and rushes toward the police car
early fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car
the female officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of the car when
a shot shatters the windshield hitting her in the chest
she collapses back onto the seat
he stops at the sight of the wounded male officer
shocked he watches the man writhing in pain
his hands clutching his crotch
his blood oozes into the dirt
early approaches the police car
he sees the dead cop and hears the radio dispatcher
officer needs help shots fired six adam five one eighty seven suspects wanted in multiple murders
location unknown last seen
brian is not sure what to do
he looks around
sees the officers handgun lying in the dirt
he takes a step toward it when
another gunshot rings out
looks to the police car
he sees early standing there smoke belching from the dashboard
the police radio is dead
early walks back toward brian and the others
he steps over to the injured male officer on the ground
tell me that dont hurt
early picks up the wounded cops gun
he hands it to brian as he trains the
automatic at brians chest
youll be doing him a favor
brian looks to early in disbelief
no no i cant
early cocks the pistol and pushes the barrel to brians head
brian looks down at the wounded cop who is writhing in pain
no its the answer to all them questions of yers
brian wont do it
he drops the gun to the ground
now youll never know
early cocks his pistol
dont do it
early look at him look at his face
thats not your father
early stares at the wounded cops face
i know that
that there is a policeman in a world of pain
and this is what you call a mercy killin
early shoots the cop again
the cop lays still
early reaches down and takes the dead cops handcuffs
he casually points the little camera at the dead cop
the lincoln hurtles down the road
adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered
carrie and brian in back handcuffed eyes hollow with exhaustion and fear
then out of the quiet
im still waiting
adele looks across the seat to early
her face drained of all expression
disappointed not so much as a simple thank you
adele at a loss
empty thank you
thank you for what
becoming aggravated what are you thanking me for adele
hesitantly she admits i dont know
it was for
screaming at her saving your fucking life back there
she shrinks away from him
gesturing with his fingertips a fraction apart darlin you were bout that far from spendin the night at the morgue
he wasnt going to shoot her you murdering son of a bitch
early looks into the rear view mirror
brian tries to defuse the situation
explodes what the fuck is wrong with you brian
if youll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes
youll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer
shut up carrie please
just shut up
the lincoln drives along an old deserted highway passing occasional gas stations and dilapidated motels
early is driving
he notices something in the distance
off in the distance
an oasis of greenery
sequence omitted from original script
a home in a secluded valley near the desert
it has a cactus garden
the garden is illuminated so it can be enjoyed at night
the lincoln parked by the front door
adele gazes out the passenger side window
shes enthralled by the sight of all the cacti
i luv cactuses cos theyre so strong
dont need much care really
reveal brian handcuffed to the steering wheel beside her
he cranes his neck to see out the rear window
early steps up to the front door of the house and rings the bell
carrie stands beside him
a light comes on inside
the door slides open a crack and mrs
musgrave an attractive older woman with silver hair peers out with a puzzled look
adele rambles on
far away you can forget about em forever and then look at em and theyre doin even better than before
watching the house adele
we gotta do something before early kills someone else
of early and carrie as they are let into the house
adele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti
there aint nothin can kill em
they can live for two even three hundred years
adele for god sake please lis
she glances over to brian there aint nothing we could do
once early sets his mind on somethin well thats the end of that
adele drifts back to the cacti
one of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle
adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus
carrie and brian sit on the floor back to back their arms bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs
musgrave is standing nearby
she pours herself a glass of bourbon
to herself its just like in that dream i had
if only i had seen their faces
she takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby
adele drops down quietly on the chair next to her
tries to cheer mrs
musgrave up youve got beautiful cactuses here i just love em
my momma used to keep a garden
musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try
distressed her head slumps down
from the kitchen hey bri
you ever stop to think that if you switched the two letters in your name
entering the room it would spell brain
early his pistol wedged in his belt appears from the kitchen eating a sandwich
he walks over and rips the phone out of the wall unit
he glimpses mrs
whats wrong with her
sorry for her she had a dream that somethin like this was gonna happen
early notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands
he steps over to her and takes the glass away
ill bet she did
he sets the glass down next to a recent picture of mrs
musgrave and an elderly man with silver hair
wheres your husband
lying im a widow
early looks at her he doesnt believe her
everything is quiet beneath the star studded sky
the same elderly man pictured with mrs
musgrave is studying the sky through a powerful telescope
musgrave is an amateur astronomer
the sound of a door opening
excited is that you peaches
come you must see saturn tonight
the rings are sensational
early leans into frame staring at the display case
inside of it is a four foot long replica of the first atomic bomb fat boy
faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate mr
musgrave had something to do with the bombs initial construction
an old photo on the bookshelf shows a much younger mr
musgrave in a s kitchen
he is laughing and embracing a s style female mannequin
my oh my this is quite rare quite rare indeed
come have a look
earlys eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in the corner of the room
the planet saturn and its glorious rings
the planet turns into a blur of light
brian and carrie are still cuffed to the piano in the background we see mrs
musgrave and adele looking out the window into the backyard
whispers to carrie you gotta talk to her
she looks up to you shell listen to you
i tried talking to her at the mine
it didnt work
then try again its our only chance
early is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope
he pulls his eye away as adele arrives
excited early mrs
musgrave has the most beautiful little guest house out back and
well no ones stayin in it
its just empty
and she said if me and you wanted to well maybe we
a scream pierces the moment
early and adele turn toward the doorway to see mrs
the older womans eyes staring past adele to the floor nearby
adele follows the terrified womans gaze to find
musgraves body lying on the floor
a bloodied wound in the back of his head
all of adeles enthusiasm drains from her face
musgrave well peaches
youre a widow now
musgrave collapses to the floor
brian and carrie are still cuffed to the piano
across from them early sits in an overstuffed chair looking through carries collection of erotic photography
to brian have you seen this one
that dont leave much to the imagination now does it
he looks at another photograph
confused he turns it upside down stares at it
musgrave is laid out on the couch
adele deep in thought watches over the older woman
finally adele reaches into her purse pulls out her small potted cactus then walks across the room to a table
its top is covered with small potted cacti
she gently places hers among them
musgrave begins to regain consciousness
her eyes open to find
adele standing over her
adele brings her finger to her lips shhhh
early looks through several more photos
he stops on one of a nude womans torso
early looks at it for a moment
then extends the photo out toward carrie comparing it to her
smiles and shakes his head in disbelief thats you aint it
carrie doesnt answer him
then in the background directly behind early
adele and mrs
musgrave quietly appear
carrie notices them as they start to cross the hallway to the kitchen
early sees carries eyes glance past him
he turns to see why
youre right early
looks back to carrie
brian also turns to her curiously
it is me
do you like it
early looks at the photo again
adele and mrs
musgrave now cross safely to the kitchen
carrie eyes meet earlys
he smiles pulls the nude photo of her close to his face
and licks it
adele quietly opens the back door
go on now
musgrave is confused is it a trick
she looks into adeles eyes
and knows its not
the old lady turns and walks out into the dark desert
adele stands at the open door watching mrs musgrave escape
in a whisper call me
early finishes looking through the photographs
he closes the cover of the portfolio
well they say theres room fur all kinds in california
and thats where were gonna be this time tomorrow
beat adele honey
early enters and sees adele standing at the back door
adele turns to face him
early looks past her into the night and realizes what shes done
he strides across the room pulling the pistol from his waistband
early pushes adele out of the way
come on back here
there aint nothin for you to be afraid of
aside from the occasional pools of light illuminating the cacti its very dark
theres no sign of mrs
he steps outside and starts firing his gun into the blackness
bullets thunk into the cacti
shouting over the gunfire nobody wants to hurt you peaches
desperate adele grabs a large potted cactus
she rushes toward early
swinging the cactus like an unwieldy bat she pummels the side of his head
he stumbles forward disappearing into the darkness
adele stands outside the kitchen door bewildered
early re emerges from the shadows
adeles eyes widen when she sees him
his cheek has long bloody gashes where the cactus ripped the flesh
what do you think youre doin
adele starts to cry
oh njus what in hell you crying bout
im the one got hit
i changed my mind early
im not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you
i think your mean and you hurt people
a look comes over earlys face that weve never seen before
that hes never felt before
he doesnt know how to deal with it
and he definitely doesnt like it
carrie watch for early
what are you going to do
im going to try and lift the end of the piano
if i can
slide your cuffs free
carrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway
brian presses his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor
carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg
what about you
i dont know
carries eyes dart back toward the kitchen
then she notices a chair nearby
can you lift it again
just lift it hurry
carrie grabs the chair
as brian lifts the piano she pushes the chair beneath the underside of it
it holds the piano suspended an inch off the floor
brian drops to the floor and slips the cuffs free
a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden
a moment later early steps quietly into the room
hes pulling the last few cactus needles from his face
he sees brian and carrie standing
you two been busy in here
what happened to adele
well lets put it this way
beat i need me a new woman
a shocked silence
brian and carrie look to one another
carrie moves toward the kitchen but early stops her
brian rushes at him
early sticks the
automatic in his face
sorry about this bri
he starts to squeeze the trigger
desperate early dont
he looks to carrie
ill do whatever you want
you want me to go with you ill go with you
just dont kill him
early deliberates the situation then eases up off the trigger
and smiles to brian
then without warning he hits brian over the head with the butt of the
brian falls to the floor unconscious
as early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs little boy onto the hood
he reaches down and grabs a six pack of beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat then slides into the drivers seat next to an anxious
carrie is now wearing one of adeles floral dresses
think anyone will notice
carrie doesnt answer early laughs
early looks out over the expanse of the desert
he sees a dirt fire road
ill bet theres a door out there
save us some time
carrie doesnt understand what he means
nonetheless she nods her head in agreement
the lincoln heads out past the cactus garden into the darkness
adeles lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti
brian is handcuffed on the floor
his eyes open slowly as he begins to regain consciousness
he senses someone behind him
he pivots around to see mrs
musgrave kneeling down to help him
in the distance a cloud of dust reveals the lincoln traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road
early still behind the wheel
carrie sits up against the passenger side door
she is tense and guarded
out the window nothing but empty desert
pass me a beer hon
carrie quietly responds
she kneels on the front seat and reaches into the back
she grabs a bottle by its neck and pulls it from the six pack of beer
bottle in hand she hesitates a moment
early watches carrie
you wanna hit me with that huh
carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the front seat
not looking at him no
she hands the bottle to him
early reaches out for the beer but instead of taking it he clasps his hand over hers
he looks at her and begins to squeeze
i can see right through you
early squeezes even harder carrie begins to wince with pain
she waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand
who dya think youre foolin
beat i know you better than you think
confused youre hurting me
early hits the brakes
the car screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust
early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins to drag her toward him
i seen the way you been lookin at me since we met
snappin my photo when you thought i wasnt lookin
carrie turns her head away
early pulls her closer
i saw you when i killed that boy
he grabs her hair with his other hand
pulls her head around forcing her to look at him
early has carrie right up against him looking right into her eyes
whispers you were plenty hot
explodes you sick twisted fuck
you dont know shit about me
she struggles trying to free herself
early his face only inches from hers smiles
some people might say takin photos of me and adele humpin in the back of the car is sick
carrie struggles even harder but early tightens his hold
you know what i mean
i know id love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face
early releases carrie taking the beer from her
carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side
i like that in a woman
he gives her a grin then opens the bottle
but ill tell ya
when we get to california were gonna have to do something bout that gutter mouth of yours
early takes a gulp of beer
early throws the bottle of beer out the window it aint lucky lager slams the lincoln into drive and accelerates along the dirt road
hes pulled out all the lines
the nearest phone is twenty miles east of here
brian notices an old pickup truck parked outside
an anxious brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck
some tools are in the back
brian still wears the handcuffs around his wrists
musgrave stands near the front door
which way did they go
pointing he took the fire road
take your car and get to that phone
call the police
brian starts the pickup and drives off
the wind has picked up
an old wooden gate blocks the fire road
on either side barbed wire as far as the eye can see
the lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier
the gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood
carrie leans against the passenger door
earlys eyes scan the open desert looking for the elusive doors
carrie reaches for her pack of cigarettes
early without a word reaches out and takes the pack from her
he crumples it up and throws it out the window
carries eyes go to the instrument panel
the temperature gauge is in the red
the pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt
brian tries to guess which direction to take
then he spots earlys discarded beer bottle up ahead
the truck accelerates straight ahead tires spinning
the winds continue to escalate blowing harder and harder
the lincoln approaches on the fire road
a trail of steam is streaming out from under the hood blinding earlys view
finally early slams on the brakes and skids degrees to a halt
steam pours out of the lincolns grill
the lincoln has had it
early is indifferent and looks around
about a hundred yards away barely visible through the growing sand storm an old s style building
early opens the back door
he grabs a box of supplies some rope a kerosene lamp etc
carrie slowly begins to respond
she slides across the front seat
carries hand crosses frame and pulls out a knob on the dash
the sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range
in the far distance
the pickup truck revealed by its trail of dust crosses the vast landscape
early and carrie struggle through the growing sand storm
carrie throws a last curious glance back to the lincoln as they reach the front door
the front door is kicked open
early enters the room with carrie in tow
he looks around the room
a smile forms on his face
howdy my names early grayce and this is my girl carrie
i hope you dont mind us bargin in like this but a
we was on our way to california when our car broke down and
a living room fully decorated in s furniture
sand covers everything
a family of four mannequins placed around the room the father sits in front of the tv
the mother the same mannequin as in mr
musgraves old picture is toppled over a kitchen counter
the little girl is seated at a table
the little boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor
its gettin pretty rough out there so if its all the same to you well be staying the night
early slams the front door shut
the building is a single story s home of extremely cheap construction
its in bad condition
the last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate
the pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the lincoln
on a collapsed old wooden sign
it lies on the ground a few feet away from the gate posts
wind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows
a solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room area
its flickering light finds
early stripped to the waist crouched over the broken tv set
he fidgets with the knobs
then the mangled rabbit ears antenna
carrie sits on some blankets in the corner next to the couch
shes scared to death
her eyes scan the battered room
amidst all of it carries erotic photographs have been placed about the room
still unable to get the tv to work he smacks it a good one on the side
with the smack
carrie whips her look back toward early
to find hes lost interest in the tv
he turns toward carrie
stares at her for a moment
then with a hint of a smile he begins to move toward her
the time has arrived
he reaches down grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her feet
carrie doesnt resist
hes rough with her as he kisses her on the lips
carrie pulls her mouth away from his
she seems confused unsure of her feelings
early watches her until her eyes come back to his
then she steps forward crowding her body against his as she slips one hand around his neck and kisses him deep and hard
suddenly early breaks the kiss and backhands carrie hard across the face
she lands on the floor several feet away the palm of her right hand is bleeding
early looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass protruding from his side
he pulls the glass shard out blood drips down his side and onto his jeans
carrie gets up and races into the back bedroom frantically looking for a way out there is none
on the bed the two adult mannequins now lie naked
they have been placed intertwined in a grotesque sexual position
carrie turns and rushes back toward the door
early intercepts her and throws a punch to her stomach which doubles her over
then early sends a second punch to her face she stumbles backward landing onto the bed amongst the mannequins
early begins undoing his belt
friendly youll like it
a violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos swirling through the air
one of the photos whips across earlys chest
the wind holds it there momentarily
not a lot but youll like it
early peels carries photo off him the blood from his wound covers the back of it
he slaps it against the nearest wall
he walks toward her
the high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm
brian is still driving dangerously fast
the dim lights of the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road ahead and the swirling sand
he passes a road sign devastation drive then
as the pickup truck comes around a corner suddenly
directly in front of him headlights
the pickup truck ploughs into the vehicle and tumbles end over end through the open desert before finally coming to an abrupt halt
with each thrust of earlys body carries badly bruised face contorts with pain and hatred sand blows in through the smashed windshield of the wrecked pickup truck
brian is upside down with his eyes shut
a trickle of blood runs down his face
camera booms up a dirt slope to reveal the lincoln beyond it on the hill above sits the desert house
the glow of the kerosene lamp is visible through the windows
the storm is over
no sand blowing
the dawn light reveals the devastated s house to be one of a cluster set at the end of a doom town cul de sac
in the darkened bedroom earlys solitary figure rustles atop the bed
slowly he awakens
his eyes open
across the bed a pair of handcuffs is locked around the bedpost
in the other cuff is carries motionless hand
then out of the corner of his eye early sees something in one of the nearby rooms
curious he stands shoves the
automatic in his waistband and walks toward the hallway
as he passes through the living room and enters the hallway his face contorts with a strange sense of wonderment
a blinding light is shafting through cracks and broken gaps around the front door frame
it looks like a magical door shrouded in a wall of light
in disbelief he pulls his gaze away from the door
and sees through a window at the opposite end of the house
the morning sun rising
with that he turns his attention back to the front door
i knew there was doors out here
he walks toward the doorway of light
he grins as he opens the door and steps through it
the sunlight momentarily blinding him
a black shadow hurtles toward him out of the brightness
eventually it blocks out all the light until
a blow knocks early back through the doorway
he slams to the ground on his back
the gun falls from his jeans and slides across the floor
a look of joyful amazement over the blood covered remains of his face he tries to get up but cant
brian silhouetted steps into the doorway
he holds a shovel raised ready to deliver a second fatal blow
but when he sees early incapacitated on the floor he lowers the shovel to his side
his handcuffed hands reach down and picks up earlys gun
he trains it on early then walks around him to enter the house
brians eyes slowly adjust to the interior
from on his back early looks out the open door
he sees two large shards of glass standing vertical in the sand reflecting the suns rays back toward the house
he realizes that the glass placed there by brian is what created the effect of the door
he starts to laugh
laughing that was damn tricky of you bri
brian searches for carrie
he moves into the back bedroom and finds carrie
she is crouched on the floor handcuffed to the bedframe
he moves to help her
as he gets closer he sees her badly bruised face and realizes whats taken place throughout the night
the sympathetic expression on his face changes
with hatred in his eyes he pivots around strides out of the bedroom and moves toward the front of the house to early
in the front room gun in hand brian rushes back into the room
he wields the pistol toward the ground where early lay
but earlys not there
brians eyes dart around the room
then suddenly from behind him early grabs him
he wrenches brians head back and whips his belt buckle knife toward his throat
brian manages to lift his hands to his neck an instant before the knife tears through his flesh
the knife slices a vicious wound across the back of brians right hand
he drops the gun to the floor
brian elbows early in the ribs and pulls away from him
he reaches to the ground for the gun but early kicks him in the stomach and sends him crumbling to his knees
go ahead bri ask me something
beat you wanna know how im feeling
well id say im feelin pretty damn good
on all fours brian reaches out for the gun but early kicks it across the room
how bout you
you feelin good
another kick to brians chest
the wind rushes out of him
cause you sure dont look so good
beat or maybe youre feelin
that it you feeling powerful
i know i am
early unloads a ferocious kick to the side of brians face
his head snaps back his handcuffed arms buckle and he falls flat to the ground
am i angry with my daddy
now why would i be angry with my daddy
youre the one hit me with the shovel
and youre the ones gonna wish you hadnt
with one last effort brian manages to pull himself back up to his knees
he focuses on the gun ahead of him and tries to crawl toward it
but earlys foot shoves brian
he flips over onto his back landing in front of the bedroom doorway
early moves toward him knife in hand
as early moves toward brian unexpectedly from inside the doorway the torso of the female child mannequin whips past
her hardened molten face slams into earlys bloodied face
early stumbles backward
brian crawls for the gun and grabs it
from his knees he turns steadies the weapon takes a quick breath
hitting early square in the chest
early falls to the ground on his back
brian lifts himself to his feet
he sees that carrie has dragged the bedframe to the doorway and in her free hand she holds the child mannequin by the leg
gun in hand brian steps over to early
earlys body is still
blood oozes from the hole in his chest
on a silver chain around his neck is the key to brian and carries handcuffs
brian reaches down and grabs the keys
when suddenly earlys arm springs up from his side
his hand grabs brians shirt collar
brian is startled by the move then realizes that earlys hold is weak
his fingers tremble
finally his arm drops back down to his side
i think i need a doctor
what dya say
the two men stare at one another for a moment
then brian with one hand still on the handcuff keys shoves the
automatic firmly under earlys chin
sorry bout this early
rings out as
close up on the chain and keys snapping free from earlys neck
close up on brians handcuffs hitting the dusty wooden floor
close up on carries handcuff swinging empty against the rusty bedpost
