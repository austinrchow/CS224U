section page section b b b tiny golden wheels and gears turning lazily upon metal rods
small and intricate
glittering in the sunlight
the gears are turning within an antique desk clock sitting on a book shelf a small pendulum swinging back and forth behind the glass housing
the room is barren except for a pair of open suitcases and a bed thats been stripped
sitting on the mattress is
smart and clever
dressed in a graduation gown and staring out the window
she seems to be lost in thought immobile until the bedroom door swings open and
aged seventeen and wearing a suit and tie steps inside
dad says we gotta get moving
im getting ready
youre sitting on the bed
dryly thanks for clearing that up
ill be right down
he steps out
julia takes a framed picture out of her suitcase a candid shot of herself standing with her mother forties a healthy and vibrant woman
contd sure do miss you
above her a ceiling fan rotates
creating a soft humming
julia walks out of the building where her father guy levin an older man with a kind face waits
connor is checking his reflection in the car window adjusting his tie fussing with his hair
i packed up everything
remembering oh except moms clock i think theres something wrong with it
its not telling the right time
ill get it fixed
probably just needs a few new parts
guy smiles at julia for a moment
contd you look just like your mother
julia is momentarily uncomfortable
but she recovers smiles and kisses her father on the cheek
well be late
students dressed in graduation caps and gowns are gathered on the campus grounds
julia stands by herself taking pictures with a professional nikon camera
she focuses the camera upon
beautiful and sexy
very particular and demanding
she smiles perfectly as julia snaps the picture
but her boyfriend sam burnside cute and mischievous sporting pink hair and loud clothes makes a face
winding her film julia searches a moment then smiles
raising her camera lens she snaps a picture of
strapping and perfectly handsome
he wears a blue and gold striped tie with his starched white shirt and graduation gown
he kisses her
passionate and gentle
you packed up
ready to move in
ill be storing some of the stuff youve already got
julia smiles at him
med school doesnt start until august
at least not for the freshmen so weve got plenty of time to see europe take the car trip up north
i hope it wont be a drag
theres a lot of stuff to move out of my mothers cabin
our friends will be there
itll be fun
i hope so
would it help if i massaged your breasts
because it would help me
stifling laughter maybe later
the students start forming into lines
contd hey i saw your mom and kid sister
wheres your dad
hes not coming
but its your graduation
paul shrugs again
a brief sting of hurt on his face
wasnt a good enough reason in high school either
paul looks away
julia knows how painful this is and wont insult him by trying to diminish it
julia smiles and runs her finger across his tie knot
i like your tie
i am a bruin
the lines start moving towards the stadium
hundreds of cheers rise up from the graduating students
as she walks a sound draws julias attention
standing on the lawn is a small boy no more than four years old sobbing and clinging to his mothers legs
julia stops walking as she gazes at the child
the line comes to a halt behind her
we cant graduate unless you move
she stalks walking again
paul puts his arms around her
a big traditional house nestled in the hills
parents and graduating students exchange polite conversation in the yard
sitting between a pair of open french doors is the gang consisting of julia and paul and terry and sam
they throw around conversation ignoring the party
nobody said anything to me about the cabin being secluded
i said it was a cabin in the woods
i thought seclusion was a given
im no good out in the woods
you know what lives in the woods
animals that sting
animals that bite
so avoid the animals
i really appreciate you guys helping me
i couldnt move everything alone
hey its our last chance to be together
terry and i are excited
turns arent we ter
shes not excited
can i bring my cotton bedsheets to the cabin
if i try to sleep in anything but cotton i get hives
whatever makes you happy
sam grabs a large drawing pad from the steps
he opens it
speaking of which ive got your graduation gift
sam holds up a sketch of clark kent changing to superman
paul checks out the drawing
his nose crinkles
whyd you want a drawing of superman
hes very attractive
staring youre kidding
hes not even real
i think most women tend to wonder if superman is super in every way
there goes your argument
thoughtfully but spiderman has a nice ass
off everyones contd what
julia finishes washing her hands
grabbing her camera and the drawing julia opens the bathroom door
standing within an open bedroom is
another college graduate
tan and attractive
dressed exactly like paul identical white shirt gold and blue striped tie
he pulls off his tie and unbuttons his shirt
julia doesnt move
the student peels off his shirt
her eyes are drawn to a superman s insignia tattooed on his shoulder
the student catches sight of julia in the hallway
her face turns bright red immediately
she starts to laugh
he smiles at her
a bit flattered
changing into something more formal
he holds up a pair of ripped jeans
julia backs down the hallway
i was just using the
ill forgive you this once
she quickly leaves
the blond student watches her go
a grin on his face
julia walks out the back door
stifling her laughter
paul is talking with guy on the lawn
julia snaps a picture of them together winds her film and notices
sweet and innocent
sitting on a bench
julia walks towards her
the little girl is staring across the lawn at a pool shed
a group of children are playing on the grass in front of it
the girl becomes aware of julias presence and turns around
you sitting here all by yourself
the girl slowly nods yes
contd dont you want to play with the other kids
the girls shakes her head no
contd want me to leave you alone
the girl shakes her head no
contd want to mix this up and ask me something
the little girl notices the camera
are you taking pictures for sams family
no im just then im a friend of sams
but im also a photographer
i take pictures
will you take a picture of me
so you wont forget me
surprised why would i forget you
because theyre coming for me
a long beat
julia sits next to her
behind the door
the girl points towards the pool shed
the rusted door of the shed is slightly open
just a crack
those other kids dont look too scared
they should be
playing along so how come only you can see them
because i know theyre real
i used to have a little brother but they came and got him
now my parents say i never had a brother before
my parents wont remember me either
something about the girls tone of voice is unnerving
as if shes resigned herself to this
a slight wind hisses through the trees
the girl rises
contd i gotta go
they know im talking about them
wait a second
julia snaps a picture of the girl
contd feel better
the girl stares at her
are you scared of monsters
the girl turns and runs across the lawn
julia is left sitting on the bench
she glances over at the pool shed again
raises her camera and focuses on the door which is still cracked open
she snaps the picture
julia and paul are romantically entangled as they enter the apartment
a little drunk
kissing and frolicking
she strips off his jacket and tie
paul abruptly stops
wait a minute grabbing both sides of his shirt this is a job for
paul rips his shirt wide open
buttons popping everywhere
they both start laughing
joining together he guides her towards the bathroom
the wind gently hisses on the balcony
a cloud of hot steam
the soothing rush of warm water running over tanned and naked skin
julia stands underneath the shower her body relaxing into pauls chest his muscular arms encircling her body his lips buried in her neck and shoulders
her eyes are shut
her expression is calm
standing in the guest bedroom at sams house
young and muscular
bathed in sunlight
the tattoo on his shoulder
her eyes still pressed closed
smiling a little
water continues rushing from the shower head creating a hiss that eventually becomes the roar the setting sun blushes crimson across the rolling waves of the pacific
streaking along the highway is a range rover packed with luggage headlights on
paul sits behind the wheel
hes bopping and rapping with sam to hip hop that blares from the speakers
julia sits on the passenger side leaning against the window trying to shut out the music
terry looks just as miserable
finally julia turns off the radio
a silent beat
the guys catch their girlfriends expressions
terry leans forward between the seats
so the cabin has electricity right
everything we need
so it has everything
it has everything
wait a minute
i hear a shoe about to drop
except a phone
there it is
scandalized i need a phone
its like family to me
mom dad my brother
phone so youre roughing it
the last time i tried to rough it i was in therapy for a year
why didnt your mother have a phone
i guess she wanted to be left alone
at least until she got sick
paul looks to her
this wont be too hard on you will it
staying at her place
im enjoying this
julia smiles at him
paul smiles back
he switches the radio back on and continues rapping with sam
julia and terry both stare straight ahead ears pounding
this is turning into a long trip
pauls range rover makes its way down a long winding road
the rovers headlights illuminate the woods lining the road on both sides
the inside of the range rover is dark
only the faint glow from the dashboard lights provides any ambient illumination
sam and terry are snuggled together in the back seat
everything is quiet
julia is thinking
finally she breaks the silence
do you believe in monsters
everyone else in the car trades looks
weve been in the car too long
im just asking
the thing under the bed
the monster hiding in the closet
what made you think of that
a little girl at sams house
she was convinced there was a monster trying to get her
youre saying you believe her
julia is suddenly on the spot
of course i dont
there are no monsters
sure there are
son of sam
who was ed gein
he was a mass murderer
this old hermit whod kill people and take the parts he wanted
why did he use the parts for
the police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl
faces were stuffed and mounted like hunting trophies on the wall
bones were used for furniture
he also wore their skin
terry recoils into her seat
sorry i asked
you wanted proof
there it is
but its not like hes a monster under the bed
so why are kids afraid of that
because they live in a completely different world than we do
then think about it
why do kids pick up on things that we cant
bumps in the night
footsteps in the hallway
a thumping inside their closet
beat kids have a perfect awareness of everything around them
everything gets quiet
contd the boogeyman could be real
so could monsters
just because youve never seen them doesnt mean they arent there
the car engine purrs softly
this is starting to make sense
and its spooky
im creeped out
but my bullshit alarm is going off
you just cant handle it
because its bullshit
serial killers aside my take on this subject is very simple
if i dont have a picture of it its not real
okay is this conversation like a radio station
can we just change the channel
because personally id like to get to sleep tonight
terry has just finished saying these words when an animal runs out of the woods into the middle of the road
a black shape in the headlights
eyes flashing in the dark
paul slams on the brakes
the range rover smashes into it throwing the shape into a ditch at the side of the road
the range rover swerves and comes to a squealing halt
everyone catches their breath
a moment of dead silence
contd everyone okay
nods were fine
what was that
i think it was a dog
julia unlocks her door
wed better check the car
she steps out of the rover
the others follow
the hazard lights are switched on
paul walks around to the front of the rover
the bumper is dented
look at that
theres a couple thousand dollars out of my wallet
you can probably get someone to pop it back
for a couple hundred dollars
sam looks down the road
he can barely make out a large form resting lifeless in the ditch
he starts walking towards it
im sorry about your car paul
begrudging yeah well
the conversation becomes distant as sam walks slowly up the road moving past the yellow flashing hazard lights which click rhythmically
click click click sam approaches the ditch
darkness is all around
he kneels down alongside the body of the animal
very little is visible of the corpse except for its dark mangled form sprawled across the dirt
sam picks up a stick and pokes at the body
he pokes at the corpse again
the hind legs of the corpse suddenly twitch
a reflex action
sam leaps back
the life nearly scared out of him
a flap of hairless skin slides away from one of the animals hind legs
sam leans forward to get a better look becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated
take a look at this
is it a dog
sam glances at the dead corpse and back to his friends again
he looks shaken
i dont know
the rest of the group moves down the road
a weird unease has started to settle in
paul and julia kneel down in front of the corpse
its almost unrecognizable
the darkness smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the bodys features
it looks like a dog to me
did you see the leg
what about it
sam takes the stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look
the group leans forward
a deep bleeding wound has been exposed
through the torn flesh and blood pumping over charcoal skin the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight
but intermingled with the animals skeleton are
glittering and clean
a series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone that have grown together
ever seen anything like that
it looks like steel
like someone put steel into its body
i dont think it was put in there
it looks like it grew that way
what kind of animal has steel in its skeleton
terry steps forward tentatively
what are you looking at
are you sure its dead
come on honey
its a dog
not a zombie
wheres your camera
its in the car
ive got it
paul races back to the range rover and opens the passenger door
he withdraws julias camera
julia takes a step back into the middle of the road
the wind is sifting through the trees creating a soft hissing noise as the branches dance and twist in the shadows
paul returns and hands the camera to sam
you want to turn it over
im not touching it
sam kneels down
he points the camera and shoots
the camera flash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse
but only for a millisecond of clarity
both of the young men stand frozen thunderstruck staring down at the misshapen shape in front of them
a long period of amazed silence follows
thats all wrong
paul shakes his head
thats not a dog
stunned what were those things coming out of its back
paul starts recoiling
his stomach is getting weak
thats not a dog
the cool summer wind whistles through the trees around them
sickened that doesnt even make sense paul
paul looks over at her
contd lets get in the car
we need some flashlights
hushed screw the flashlights
what the hell is it
were outta here
julia and paul walk briskly to the range rover
sam and terry follow them glancing back over their shoulders
what the hell is it
paul tosses the camera into the rovers back seat
he slams the door shut
julia opens the front passenger door
a soft thumping from the woods
almost like footsteps
get in the car
julia hops into the front seat and slams her door
the atmosphere is quickly turning into panic
paul jumps behind the wheel as both sam and terry close their doors
i want to know what that thing was
paul presses the automatic door lock
paul start the car
he searches his pockets
he checks his jacket
i want to know what it was
will you shut up
paul fishes out the car keys from his jacket pocket
he starts the ignition
the engine roars to life
a heavy thump
right outside the back window
sam and terry instinctively look towards the rear hatch
theres something behind the car
paul hits the gas
the range rover disappears into the night
the calm and unnerving quiet of the woods are left behind
the wind whistles softly
a fast food joint at the side of the road
everyone is sitting quietly at a table
fast food leavings are littered across their plastic trays
nobody is saying anything or looking at one another
i want to get the body
everyones face drops into shock
paul almost laughs
you do that
well wait for your ass right here
sam leans forward in his seat
nothing about that thing looked right
there was metal in its skeleton
maybe it wasnt metal
it mightve just looked like metal
there were fucking gears for chrissake
go back out there
do whatever the hell you want
but count me out
weve already got a picture sam
lets get a few more then
i want to get a good look at that thing up close
adamant im not going back there
let julia decide
its her camera
the group stares at julia
she remains silent
julia stares back at all of them
a small child begins crying and screaming in the restaurant
julia flinches at the unexpected sound glancing over at the childs parents as they quiet him down
she rises from the table
i have to use the bathroom
she walks straight into the bathroom
after shes gone
im not going back there
large and poorly lit
several closed bathroom stalls face a row of sinks and a huge mirror
a toilet flushes
julia leaves one of the stalls and pulls the door closed behind her
she moves to the mirror washes her hands and retrieves a brush from her purse
water drips from one of the leaky pipes in the bathroom while the fluorescent bulb over the mirror crackles softly
julia is about to brush her hair but something unnerves her
she cocks her head slightly
she turns around and checks out the bathroom
the doors to the stalls are all closed shut
empty and quiet
she starts brushing her hair
a few moments pass
then she stops and listens to the water dripping from the pipe
julia turns back around and looks at the bathroom
one of the stall doors all the way at the end is now slightly open
just enough to reveal a patch of darkness and gloom within
the sound of water dripping abruptly stops
julia looks like shes about to crawl out of her skin
she quickly shoves her brush back into her purse and leaves
julia walks towards her friends as they collect themselves
everyone is slow getting their stuff together
i want to leave
the child starts crying again
pointing at the bathroom
this disturbs julia further
the group leaves the table
the group emerges from the restaurant
the parking lot is almost deserted
no people are in sight
julia moves leisurely towards the range rover just ahead of terry and sam but shed walk a lot faster if pauls arm werent draped around her shoulder
she looks tight and nervous
her eyes scanning the parking lot
the cars are empty
sidewalk litter dances in the wind
inside one of the parked cars a featureless shape is sitting behind the wheel
the shape turns and stares at them
everyone piles into the range rover
julia throws a nervous glance back at the shape in the car
hes still watching them
everyone piles into the car
paul starts the engine and pulls out of the parking lot
julia relaxes into her seat relieved
the range rover heads off into the woods
a rustic home surrounded by huge pine trees and beach grass overlooking the ocean
there are no neighbors in sight
pauls range rover is parked out front
the basement is saturated in a bright red light
julia is developing a photograph within a small basin
paul and terry are seated on the stairs
sam is pacing
how much longer
its coming out
i still think we should get the body
we could drive out there haul it into the car
im not loading that thing into my car
i dont give a shit what it is
its not coming back here
julia lifts the developed picture out of the basin
she switches on the light
the group crowds around her
what is it
what does it look like
the photograph is blurred
the body is indistinguishable
what happened to the picture
out of focus
what do you mean its out of focus
i took the picture
the flash went off
sam this is a professional camera with a zoom lens
you cant just point and shoot
a quiet moment as they stare at the picture
well so much for that
sam looks at the picture then at his friends
with a look of somber frustration sam quietly turns and charges up the stairs taking two at a time
after hes gone its not a big deal
whatever it was
then hell get over it
cloudy and overcast
a set of colorless waves crash into the rocks
sam and julia and terry walk just beyond the rippling surf arguing with each other
i cant get over it
that thing looked wrong
of course it looked wrong
paul rammed it with his car
what about the blood
it wasnt red
it was black it was like
oil coming from a busted engine
i mustve missed that
lets find it
cut it up
measured sam i realize that youre an extroverted comic book artist and im a neurotic
but its only now at this moment that im wondering why were dating
sam turns back to julia ill pay you to take me back
you dont have to pay me
take the car
the rovers a shift
i can only drive an automatic
hes out running
besides you heard him last night
hed never do it
julia stares at him
its a dead animal
so come with me
you take the pictures this time
if its just a dead animal then youre right and im wrong
but if its not weve got a picture of it
a picture of what
a set of foaming waves hiss as they slide along the sand
julia stands with her arms folded
theres something really creepy about it which she doesnt want to admit
monsters dont exist
pause sayin yes
or saying no
julia stares at him deadpan
sam just stares right back
the same lonely stretch of road from the night before
the range rover appears around a corner and pulls over to the side of the road
julia opens her door camera in hand and gets out
sam follows her lead
this is it
i think so
you can see the way the road turns sharply to the left
the rest of the drive was straight
youve got film right
a new roll
you can have all the pictures you want
julia and sam start searching the ditch
feet crunching in the dirt
moving away from the car
a soft thump echoes from somewhere in the woods
a place just beyond the wall of pine branches and shrubbery that shivers in the breeze
sam and julia look around
slight grin the boogeyman lives here
so will you if you keep talking like that
they keep walking
a beat passes
can i ask you something
last night on the road after i took the picture and we started walking to pauls car did you have the same feeling
that we were being chased
julia doesnt say anything
she stops cold in her tracks
just ahead of her resting motionless in the ditch is
swathed in dark fur twisted at a pathetic angle huge gashes in its side
the corpse of a doberman pinscher flies are buzzing and swarming over the dogs open wounds
julia and sam move towards the dogs lifeless form
theres your monster
thats a dog
sam kneels in front of the corpse
waves off some flies
thats not what i saw
i dont see any other corpses on the side of the road do you
a long moment
sam stares back down at the dobermans body
thats not what i saw
eyes slightly open
a misshapen form plagued with flies
the sound of insects swarming drowns out the wind hissing through the trees
paul is jogging through the woods
a light mist hangs in the cool air
the sounds of the forest surround him
suddenly the birds stop singing
paul becomes aware of this
he stops running and looks around
the forest is deathly still
the sound of a twig being crushed underfoot
paul keeps going a chill on his spine looking back over his shoulder
a picture postcard community consisting of quaint storefront shops and manicured parks
paul stands right in front of a freshly painted realty office building with a picketed fence sipping a coke watching a homeless woman across the street screaming and shouting at
shes right next to the parked range rover
julia walks out of the realty office
the cabin has a buyer
what about the movers
theyre coming on sunday afternoon so well have to start packing
the homeless woman starts walking off down the sidewalk
moving away from the rovers parking space
i thought we were gonna have to make a run for the car
i feel sorry for those people
but that doesnt mean i want to get screamed at
people are ignoring her
maybe thats the only way she can get attention
shes doing a good job
kept me away
they start crossing the street towards the car
how does someone end up like that
i think were witnessing it first hand with sam
what did you guys find on the road anyway
paul stares at her
personally im glad we didnt find frankensteins monster
you just like being right
grins damn straight
sam heads away from the cabin his drawing sketch pad under his arm moving into the woods
a picture is lifted out of the developing basin
the shot of the little girl from the party
her expression is distant
bathed in the red light julia gazes at the picture for a moment then places it to the side
she goes to work on the next piece of developing paper into the basin
rocks the basin a bit
the timer in the basement ticks
the picture starts to manifest
the photo of the children and pool shed at sams house
julia frowns slightly
something is wrong with the photograph as the details become more tangible
she lifts the photo out of the basin
standing just inside the sheds door is a blurred figure
hiding in the dark
sam is sitting on a fallen tree trunk sketching on his drawing pad with a feverish intensity
a rough drawing of the animals leg intertwined with steel rods and metal threads which culminate in a large pulley where the hip bone should be
a warm and comfortable cabin
simple and subdued
paul is seated on the couch typing into his powerbook which is hooked up into a phone jack in the wall
julia stands next to him holding the photograph
ive never seen anything like this before
i thought it might be a flaw in the negative but now im not so sure
will you take a look
not paying attention okay
he keeps watching
youre in a chat room with a bunch of strangers
defensive theyre friends
what are their last names
they sit face to face
paul is speechless for a moment then impatiently takes the photograph and looks at it
i dont see anything
he puts the photo down and gets back to the chat room
you didnt even look
he didnt i looked
theres somebody in the shed
i couldnt see it when i took the picture but now its there
usually when you take a picture you cant see a blur
paul smiles at her
julia stares right back
give your friends my best
julia takes the photograph and leaves
paul types into his computer julia sends her best
the message pops up next to his user name
within seconds several other user names in the chat room respond with whos julia
terry is sitting on the counter twirling her hair and chatting on a cell phone
julia enters the kitchen
on the phone im not kidding dana
theres no phone
beat theres a jack and the phone line works but theres no phone uh huh
paul was able to get on the internet
im using his cell
quietly i need you to look at something
julia holds out the picture
terry looks it over briefly
polite nice picture
she gets back to her phone conversation
contd im back
beat i dont know if he has any free minutes but he definitely wont after this conversation
thank god for airtouch
frustrated julia takes the picture and leaves the kitchen
the air is completely still
a hush has fallen
the only sound is the ocean and crickets chirping in the grass
julia wanders outside holding some of the developed photographs from the party
sam is sitting on the front steps working on his drawing
could you look at
sam looks up from his drawing pad
julia sits on the porch glider and looks through the photos
the little girl looking back over her shoulder
the blurred shape inside of the shed
a moment passes
julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up
she slips into a dream like state calm and relaxed before opening her eyes to find
sitting back on the hood of a sports car
wearing a white tank top undershirt
the tattooed s insignia visible on his shoulder
bathed in soft moonlight
he even looks good in the dark
their eyes meet
smiles are traded between them
the wind sifts gently over the porch
its all very dream like a spacious bedroom
julia is already in bed and wearing a night shirt
paul is grinding out a set of crunches
it just would have been nice if somebody had looked at it
you were on the internet
terry was on the phone
i felt like i was living with a bunch of machines instead of people
would you look at it again
i already did
and i still dont see anything
paul gets into bed
that little girl said there was a monster in the shed
kisses her it was probably another dog
he switches off the light
paul turns over and goes to sleep
julia sits for a moment in the dark
alone with her thoughts
she looks over at the walk in closet across the room
the closet door is slightly open
just a crack
not enough to provide any clear view of what lies within but just enough for something monsters included to peek out
julia stares at the closet
she knows better but its dark and her primal fears are taking control
to herself stupid
she gets out of bed and tiptoes to the closet shutting the door
then she gets back into bed
smiling to herself she goes to sleep
the wind is picking up
the clock on the night table reads am
julia turns over in her sleep and stirs awake
she groggily looks over towards the closet
julia practically sits up in bed
the closet door is wide open
a childhood nightmare come to life
julias breathing quickens
she reaches towards the other side of the bed
a whisper paul
her hand finds nothing but sheets and empty space
theres nobody there
she quickly turns to locate her boyfriend
but hes gone
she tries to switch on the light
the light stays off
she tries again
then she hears it
a faint sound
almost like a shuffling the sound of something dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed
julias throat has gone dry
carefully she creeps towards pauls side of the bed and checks the floor
there is nothing in sight
the only sign of movement are the shadows from the trees outside
there is only one place left to look
julia cautiously steps down to the floor
sinking down on her knees she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the inky darkness underneath the bed
the space is empty
julia drops the dust ruffle and sits up gasping
then a familiar voice comes from it
its just me
paul switches on the light
hes wearing a ucla sweatshirt
the light wouldnt turn on
julia catches her breath
the fear finally draining from her
where were you
i was cold so i got a sweater from the closet
and i went to the bathroom
why were you looking under the bed
julia isnt quite sure how to answer
i thought there was something in the room
packing tape is pulled back from a roll
julia finishes taping up a cardboard box
terry is packing some books into another box of her own
you thought there was a monster in the room
and you admitted it
i didnt know what else to say
when you dont know what else to say you lie
but i really did hear something
youre worse than my boyfriend
julia looks towards the front door
sam is sitting on the porch steps sketching on his pad oblivious to everything around him
hes in his own world isnt he
thats an understatement
i have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the question for this trip
this sparks something in julia
she hesitates looking through an open doorway where paul can be seen packing some clothes
julia speaks to terry in confidence
do you fantasize about other people
if i havent yet i probably will by the time were ready to leave
ive been fantasizing about a guy
anyone we know
id like to know that
hushed he has a superman tattoo on his shoulder
terrys mouth drops
the girls move closer together
yes when did this start
i walked out of the bathroom and he was changing out of his suit
he lost his tie his shirt
and then he spotted me
what did you say
i got out of there
but ive been fantasizing about him ever since
power to the people
but paul is the perfect boyfriend
top to bottom
hes gonna be a doctor
continuing he never gets upset about anything
what the hell is wrong with me
its just a fantasy
yeah but when i made love to paul on grad night
i thought of him terry stares
dont tell paul about this
id rather not test the whole he never gets upset about anything part
are you okay
i dont know
i think im flipping out
seeing things in pictures
thinking that theres a monster in my closet
rising youre being too sensitive
we woke up with our closet wide open and im not upset about it
your closet was open
having to wash my hair without an all natural conditioner
that upsets me
she walks out
julia sits quietly in the living room left alone with her own puzzled thoughts
julia is walking down the hallway
she happens to pass the bathroom door which is slightly open
within the bathroom
the blond student is toweling off
the tattoo plainly visible on his shoulder
his eyes lock on hers
julia reacts and runs straight into paul
you scared me
i wasnt looking
im going for a run
see you when you get back
remembers oh paul
dont leave the closet door open anymore all right
you left it open
i closed it after i got my sweatshirt
i thought you opened it
well damn julia
your monster isnt just noisy hes also inconsiderate
he kisses her on the cheek and takes off
julia stands alone in the empty hallway a chill running down her spine
the door slowly creaks open
julia stands in the doorway surveying the closet a cluttered and claustrophobic space despite its size
clothes draped on hangars
cardboard boxes stacked on shelves
julia moves inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a switch
the bulb stays dark
she tries again
the light still wont come on
julia carefully looks through some of the clothes
she kneels down and checks the floor
a long creaking behind her
the natural light fades
julia looks over her shoulder a bit skittish as the closet door eases back towards the doorjamb
but theres nobody there
just the faintest hint of a draft
julia keeps searching through the clutter
moving shoes and boxes out of the way
then she spots something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet doorway
a small object resting in the corner
julia reaches down and picks it up
small and intricate with erratic markings
twisted and strangely ornate
the shape and texture of the metal is almost completely alien
julia holds the metal into the light
behind her a shadow moves
julia screams dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box smashes down behind her
tumbling from one of the shelves above
old shoes scatter across the floor
julia catches her breath
on the floor the metal object sparkles in the light
a draft hisses through the open closet door
the range rover races down the empty road
julia sits behind the wheel
her eyes intense
she looks over at the passenger seat where both her purse and the metal object are located
the range rover streaks out of the woods towards santa mira
julia walks up the front steps leading to the library a weathered building that overlooks the town square
a banner hangs over the front entrance
the stacks are deserted and still
julia sits at a reading table flipping through a book surrounded by long rows of bookshelves
julia flips from page to page allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings vampires werewolves witches a ghastly thing crawling out from under a maidens bed
as she puts down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table
she opens it and starts paging through
as julia finds a drawing of a sleeping child
just beyond the bed is an open closet door the horrid face a monster watching the child from within
julia shivers down to her soul
a familiar feeling of late
a slight squeaking catches her attention
she looks across the reading room to find ten years old
sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite her
hes wearing a superman shirt
he smiles timidly and waves
julia waves back
a thump behind her
julia turns and looks over her shoulder
she barely catches sight of a shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks
the scraping of chair legs against the cold floor
julia looks back towards where the boy was sitting
the chair is pushed back and empty
another thumping in the stacks
a feeling of anxiety washes over julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves
its getting dark
moonshadows shift across the lawn
soft rock seeps from a pair of portable compact disc player speakers
paul removes a lid of grass and some zigzag papers and starts to roll a joint
everyone looks pretty toasted
cardboard boxes and candles are everywhere
sam is sitting off to himself
hes still drawing on his pad
julia is reading one of the books from the library
takes a hit monsters
symbols and dream images
now you see i dont agree with that
i think everything has some kind of physical representation
people cant just come up with this stuff
you did a good job last night
julia hands him the metal object from the closet
what do you make of this
whered you find it
in the closet you didnt leave open
whats she talking about
wearisome my girlfriend believes in the boogeyman
i never said it was the boogeyman
maybe its some primeval energy that causes a response in human beings
this could be the physical representation of that energy
its piece of shit
julia turns hopefully to terry yes
its the physical representation of a piece of shit
pot induced laughter
julia takes back the object
youre not being objective about this
have either of you ever been scared
im scared right now that youve smoked too much
ive been really scared
maybe when we hit the dog
sam looks unsettled
you mean this
sam tosses his sketch pad into the center of the floor
everyone leans forward getting a good look at sams detailed drawing of completely fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone
almost as accurate as a photograph
contd that thing we hit on the road
it wasnt a dog
it wasnt some primeval force either
then it was a monster
julia picks up the drawing as paul peers over her shoulder
the picture looks particularly unsettling in the flickering firelight
it almost looks alive
the fire is dwindling
terry and sam have both passed out
julia relaxes on the floor staring at sams drawing while resting in pauls lap
i cant believe sam drew this
hes been acting like a freak
you think we couldve been wrong
about the dog
maybe the next day when sam and i went back to the road
maybe we found the wrong body
can we drop this
i just want to know
i just want to know whats going on
nothings going on
here give me the drawing
im not done yet
your hands are shaking
come on julia
give yourself a break
she hands the drawing pad to him
paul puts it on the couch
we need to talk about this
paul begins stroking her hair
gently and repeatedly
just for a minute
julia looks really tired
she closes her eyes for a moment as pauls steady breathing fills the room
the she opens them turns her head and gazes at
sitting in a chair
smoking a cigarette
smiling down at her
she cranks her head and looks deeply into her boyfriends eyes
he smirks and gently strokes her hair
soft youre tired
go to sleep
her breathing becomes more steady
in the distance a sound begins to permeate the cabin
grinding and drumming like the churning of a large factory
a calming and soothing noise drifting over
quick flashes of images which are strung together a a turbine driven by a cloud of pumping steam
b the superman tattoo on the blond students shoulder
c a doberman running across a road
d a man limping along wearing leg braces and using steel crutches
e a womans hands slipping over a young mans bare chest
f a back brace being locked into place
the stall door at the far end of the bathroom eases open
sound except for the humming of machines
julia stumbles through the snake pit
mental patients stagger around her
many of them are dressed like homeless people
staring into space
bodies twitching and gnawing on their fingers
lying in their own urine
julia looks skyward towards a screen that doubles for a ceiling
dark figures are standing on the screen looking down at them
a pair of orderlies gently take julias arm and lead her out of the snake pit
julia looks at the wall as she walks
shadows move across the wall
almost like ripples in water
but the shadows gradually become the grotesque silhouettes of human body parts arms legs heads feet hanging and rocking gently from hooks blood trickles down over the superman tattoo
clawed fingers slide around the open stall door
person is having a seizure
propped against the wall
his head and body are entirely covered with braces that form a metal exoskeleton
a gynecology exam
a womans legs are held open by stirrups
a pair of hands protected by rubber gloves cruelly insert a large alien looking metal object which is nothing but sharp tentacles and angles between the legs
a woman shrieking through rotting teeth and blood
julia steps into the surgical room
the little girl from sams party is resting on a gurney
her small body is clamped down with metal bands
her blonde curls draped over the edge
her eyes open and staring at nothing
something else lurches into the room
moving in the shadows
a surgeon enclosed in metal braces and holding a pair of alien looking shears in his hands
julia tries to scream
no sound comes out
the shears close
several drops of blood
then a blonde curl
hit the tile floor
the sound of the machines is interrupted by living room night julia lurches awake
paul and terry are lying immobile on the floor
hundreds of candles have been placed throughout the room bathing the cabin in a dull amber glow
there is no julia starts to rise to her feet
her fingers graze something sharp
she winces and snatches her fingers away from
julia discovers a small ribbon of blood trickling from her index finger
she sucks on it and notices sitting behind the couch
his eyes are intense as he erases something from his drawing pad
julia walks around him until she can see the sketch
sam erases the picture working from the shoulders up
there is still julia is dumbfounded
she hears a slight noise coming from somewhere in the cabin
a small hissing sound
soft and unobtrusive
julia looks around
the sound seemed to come from behind her
but theres nothing in the room
her friends are still asleep
sam is concentrating on his drawing
unmistakable this time
a diminutive scraping almost like fingernails raking on icy glass slithering out from a darkened hallway
she moves towards the sound
julia creeps into the hallway until she can barely see the rows of bedroom doors
all of them are closed shut
the scraping sound rises up again
behind one of the bedroom doors
julia reaches out for the doorknob
the door opens
julias stomach rises into her throat
terror floods her face
resting on the bed is a body bag
so smeared with blood that the corpse inside isnt visible except for its massive bulk
something scratches on the body bag from julias body goes rigid
she cant force herself to move
the body bag is slowly unzipped from the inside
stretching down the length of the plastic until the bag is wide open
the corpse inside is still hidden
as if drawn by some alien force julia moves to the bed
her entire body is shaking
she reaches out and carefully peels back the plastic
resting within the body bag is the little girl
eyes puffed shut
hair slicked with blood
her skin is livid
her face is ghostly white and smeared with crimson gore
julia is frozen in place
julia is startled awake and groggily looks around the room
paul and terry are still in the process of getting up
look whos up
smiles you sleep well
julia stares back
she looks pretty freaked
contd uh oh
i didnt sleep well either
i dreamt that all these cockroaches were eating my legs
you want to trade
right before i woke up my head exploded and all these snakes came out
probably went to bed
terry nods as she rises to her feet
i need a hairbrush
and a facial
she stumbles into the hallway
paul turns to julia
you had nightmares too
worst ones ive had in a long time
i thought i was hallucinating
paul winces and rubs his temples
contd whats wrong
ill be fine
terry briskly walks out the hallway
she looks alarmed
the group walks towards one of the bedroom doors
i cant get the door open
paul tries the doorknob
the door wont budge
sam open up
he pounds harder
he wont answer
maybe he cant answer
paul shoves hard against the door
but it still wont give
what about the bathroom door
it connects to your room
i tried it
paul turns the doorknob and throws all his weight against the door trying his best to bust it down
no such luck
voice rising sam he tries again and again
the door inches open
just a crack
contd help me out with this
paul and julia push on the door forcing it wider
paul struggles through the aperture slipping underneath a mattress thats been placed against the door and stumbles into the room
the bedroom is a disaster area clothes and smashed glass cover the floor
mirrors have been shattered
most of the furniture and portions of the bed have been piled in front of the door creating an almost impassible barricade
the window is wide open the curtains billowing in the breeze
julia and terry make their way into the room
careful of the glass
dont step on it
the group stares at the room
taking it in
trying to comprehend it
frozen you got me
paul and terry are walking along the trail
her words sound hollow in the empty forest as they keep moving passing behind huge pine trees that obscure them from view
a soft breeze rises up and hisses through the trees
julia is cleaning the mess in the room
shes just finished tossing a few shards of broken glass into a garbage bag when she flinches and draws her index finger back
the finger has a scab on it
exactly where she cut it in the dream
dried blood marks the wound
terry looks beside herself
paul and julia are seated
he must have gotten out through the window
thats the only thing i can figure
we have to call the police
you looked everywhere
everywhere near the cabin
but we cant cover every square inch of forest out there
he might be sick
he might need help
i cant understand why hed do something like this
he was acting nuts
impatient i need a phone
ive got my cell
paul fishes the cell phone out of his pocket
he hands it to her
almost on cue
terry glances over at her friends then clicks the receiver
beat sam julia and paul sit up in their seats
contd where are you
no where are you
beat how did you get there
terry hurriedly grabs a pen
she starts writing on a pad
contd just a minute
im writing it down
i think i know where it is
beat sam whats going on
she hangs up the phone
where is he
i dont know
he wants me to meet him
my brother has an apartment up there
hes out of town but i have a spare key
i guess i could stay there
you still want to call the police
terry doesnt respond to this
outside an open window the wind hisses through the trees
an empty bus station consisting of a single room with a clerk sitting behind the front desk
julia and paul are sitting on a pair of chairs waiting patiently
terry is using a phone booth outside
she hangs up and walks into the depot
did you get his parents
it was the wrong number
didnt sam give you that number
maybe i wrote it down wrong
terry winces a bit
she massages her legs
are you okay
my legs are killing me
you sure you dont want us to drive you
you have to stick around for the movers
ill be fine
the bus arrives in front of the depot
contd theres my ride
terry grabs her suitcase
julia hands her a slip of paper
this is pauls cell number
you call us
let us know what happens
i just need to talk to him
dont call the police or anything until ive had a chance to do that
terry hugs julia
paul gives her a quick kiss on the cheek
carrying her suitcase terry backs toward the door smiling sadly at julia and paul as she opens it
contd itll be okay
her voice resonates with desperate hope rather than confidence
she leaves the depot
paul places his arms around julia as they watch the bus leave the station trailing smoke
julia is cleaning up
she kneels down and picks up some of the melted candles and beer bottles
paul walks into room holding a broken picture frame
i talked to the movers
why didnt they show up
the company has no record of the order
are they coming now
itll take them a while to work us into the schedule get a van out here to pick up everything
paul holds out the mangled frame
i also found this in the guest bedroom
sam knocked one of the packing boxes over
this was inside
julia takes a look at the frame
its the same picture from her room of herself with her mother
the broken glass has torn the photograph
contd i wasnt sure if you wanted to keep it
ive got one
contd you know this is the only picture i have of my mother
beat she was always taking pictures of us but we never got any of her
emotional if i didnt have this i couldnt prove that i had a mother
thats not true
im so worried about sam
julia drowns in her thoughts
paul touches her cheek
lets get outta here
smiles good idea
ill get my keys
paul walks out
julia places the frame on the coffee table
she notices something on the floor
its a small object resting in the corner almost hidden from view
julia reaches into the shadows and picks up
another piece of metal with strange markings
julia stares at the object in her palm
to herself where are these coming from
a warm summer afternoon
the entire town has congragated in a park with a breathtaking view of the ocean
music and noise
a huge banner draped over the street reads
julia navigates her way past the booths and thrill rides that have been erected on the lawn
she watches some passersby
as a mother talks on a cell phone while her six year old daughter tugs at her sleeve
trying to get her attention
the mother keeps pushing the child away as she talks
julia observes this scene until she hears
im your mother
julia steps out of the crowd
searches for the voice
woman is shadowing a college age girl walking with her boyfriend
theyre trying to ignore her
im your mother im your mother
im your mother
the couple walks faster
the homeless woman is left behind
contd futile im your mother julia stares helplessly
spinning merrily in the center of the park
loud calliope music
young kids and teenagers occupy the horses and benches
julia slowly walks towards the carousel snapping pictures of the children and whirling lights
behind her the sound of a screaming child rises above the music and laughter
she turns and finds a two year old baby sitting on her fathers shoulders crying and pointing at wearing his blue superman shirt
hes sitting on a swing set by himself
sad and alone
he makes eye contact with julia
she smiles at him and waves back
the poles spearing the horses rising and falling into the floor
the platform rotating near the grass
the calliope music becomes the humming of machines
julia is wandering through a maze of shooting galleries
she searches through the crowds of teenagers and children at the booths
finally she locates
approaching her with a large teddy bear under his arm
where did you go
i won this for you
julia smiles at the bear
you sure you want to give him up
nice smile i think hed crowd my barbie collection
julia kisses him
he kisses her back and winces in pain
head still hurts
need some aspirin
already took some
ill be okay
paul notices that theyve wandered into a row of psychic and tarot card booths
contd hey look
want to get your palm read
as long as youre feeling up to it
julia spots another booth with a sign overhead the past through possessions
just a minute
you go to the palm reader
i want to check out this one
the past through possessions
unimpressed scam city
and palm reading isnt
shes got him there
ill meet you over there
she kisses him quickly
they split up
paul approaches the booth
an african american woman in her mid forties tess sits behind the counter
loose and upbeat
wearing more colors in her clothing than even a rainbow could provide
can you read my palm
you got five bucks
julia walks to the front counter of the booth
a pair of women are sitting behind the counter but the one who sticks out is rosemary sixty psychic and clairvoyant
she wears a purple kaftan which barely hides her weakness for ice cream and cookies
can we help you honey
you can tell me things just by holding something of mine
i have a perfect track record
i found two missing children in the spring of and helped the state police catch a murderer in
sourly my grandchildren arent quite as impressed
a little brighter what did you want me to look at
julia reaches into her pocket and gently places something on the counter in front of rosemary
tess takes pauls hand
so what do you want to know
its kinda stupid
but i sorta wanted to know about my dad
if i should see him
knowingly you and your father dont get along
my parents got divorced when i was sixteen
i got into a fight with him
said some stuff
he bows his head a little
a tough subject for him
lets take a look
tess cocks her head a little to the side
she looks confused
contd soft ill be damned
well kid you might be the first person to make me hang up my fortune telling degree
usually the palm makes sense and this one doesnt
how do you mean
according to this you dont exist
off paul his face turning white
rosemary handles one of the metal objects turning it over in her palm
julia watches her as she goes through this ritual
this is interesting
let me guess
they came from a vacuum cleaner right
this came from a machine
but not a household appliance
where did it come from
rosemary turns the object over in her palm
over and over
something that was alive
julia leans forward in her seat
but you just said it came from a machine
so how can a machine be alive
i dont make the news
i just report it
i found the larger one inside of a closet
do you know how it got there
rosemary continues meditating
turning the object over between her fingers
staring at it
gradually she falls into a trance
her breathing slows
we shed our parts
and our skin
what are you talking about
rosemary is oblivious to anything around her
but they need to be replaced
some of the parts we can find
beat others need to be harvested
the other psychic seated next to rosemary throws her a curious glance as she counts up some money
contd well wait on the side of the road
until one of the machines come
beat one of us will be sacrificed
that will stop the machine
then we can take whatever skins are inside
softer we can use their parts
paul walks up
she motions for him to be quiet
we stopped the machine
but there are more of the skins than we thought
lets take off
we must wait
more of us are needed to capture them
whats she talking about
wait just a minute
the objects continue turning in her hand
and turning there are more of us now
weve surrounded them
but theyre leaving too quickly
well follow them
well watch them
beat well take them as the need for parts becomes necessary
the wind gently hisses through the booths tent
maybe well only take one
beat maybe well take another
and another a sudden gust of wind rises through the tent as
the sound of mumbling and confusion seethes from the crowd
julia rises out of her chair
paul takes her into her arms as children can be heard crying throughout the park
above them the wind hisses through the trees
julia sits on the porch
paul is stretched out on the grass looking up at the stars
so the power went out
that doesnt mean anything
did you hear what she said
she was talking about the accident
the night you hit that thing on the road
she knew about that
julia a psychic tells you some random shit and then lets you make sense out of it
she said it was waiting for us
an animal was waiting for us to come along and run it down
what was the explanation
rotten home life
was it taking prozac
it wanted to stop the car
something about needing parts
if it needed parts it shouldnt have committed suicide
she said there were more of them
who cares what she said
it doesnt mean anything
but its not just that
julias voice becomes soft
as if she were telling a secret
contd ive also had this feeling
ever since sam disappeared
i cant shake it
what is it
i feel like somethings missing
i dont know
its on the tip of my tongue
i just feel like ever since we woke up that morning somethings not right
theres someone who should be here right
its not sam
then did that palm reader say anything strange to you
anything at all
he looks back at the night sky
can i use your phone
a traditional home
the phone rings and connor comes charging down the stairs
he answers it
julia is sitting on the couch
i thought you were someone else
nice to hear your voice too
you having fun
understated not exactly
i got my psats back
you think thats good enough to get into berkeley
youll get in
listen is dad there
well could you leave him a message
tell him that the movers didnt come so ill be here a few more days
tell him that i have some stuff of moms that he might want
show a little faith
when have i ever forgotten something
a piece of developing paper is slipped into the tray basin
julia gently rocks the basin back and forth
a picture starts to manifest on the paper
paul splashes his face with water
he looks worse than he did the night before
he grabs some aspirin from the medicine cabinet
julia leans forward to get a better view of the developing picture
an image is slowly forming carousel horses the vague outlines of poles and children
paul is shirtless and doing one armed push ups
his muscles churn
his body rises and falls like a piston
the picture has come into view
the children laughing as they ride the horses
and something else
a dark form in the center of the carousel
pauls arm as he does push ups sweat beading on his biceps muscles rippling
the sound of machines pulsates and segues into
julia takes the picture out of the developing basin
we move into the photo theres a dark shape standing in the middle of the carousel
blurred and indistinct
almost like a except that its waving at the camera
paul is sitting on the couch wearing a ucla cross country tank top and tying his shoes
julia enters from the basement
shes carrying a stack of developed pictures
paul you have to see this
the picture came out but theres something really strange in the middle of it
just like the other one of the shed
he looks at the picture
looks like someone on the carousel
but theres no features
its like a shadow
so there wasnt enough light
paul rubs his forehead
julia is genuinely concerned
whats the matter
my head feels worse
maybe you should lie down
i have to go running
no you dont
of course i do
your bodys like a machine
it needs upkeep
not when youre physically ill
ill be okay
ill be okay
about the picture is that it
beat when i saw this picture i decided to look at the other one
just for comparisons sake
julia takes out another photograph
i pulled this one by mistake
the picture of that little girl from the party
she hands him the picture
pauls face collapses into slack disbelief
the little girl has disappeared from the photo
paul turns to julia as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of fear and apprehension
contd whats going on
this time he doesnt have an answer
murky and still
a few shafts of sunlight permeate the gloom
paul is jogging along the trail keeping a steady pace the sounds of the forest all around him
the trail snakes towards a wooden bridge that spans over a trickling creek
paul runs across the soles of his sneakers slapping on creaking wood
he moves deeper into the woods
a lonely part of the woods where almost all the daylight is blocked out by the trees
paul jogs along the trail when he slows to a halt sweaty and out of breath
his skin is pale
his limbs are shivering
paul cradles his head shutting his eyes suffering from obvious pain
very soft oh god
make it stop
he starts walking forward again
a slight tinkling sound as he kicks something at his feet
his eyes blink open as he looks down
there are several pieces of metal littering the trail
almost like nuts and bolts but alien in their design
paul reaches down and picks one of the bolts up
he keeps walking following more pieces of metal that lead off the footpath
a darker spot enclosed by pine trees
a few birds are singing overhead
paul enters the forest pushing back branches following the trail of discarded metal until he freezes
his eyes staring directly ahead at
hanging from branches
scattered on the ground
like the skin of a snake which has been shed
paul is completely unsettled
he kneels down picking up a flap of skin from the ground peeling it away from a steel rod dripping with oozing slime
holds it up
its still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light
the wind hisses through the trees mussing pauls hair
paul drops the piece of skin on the ground
the birds abruptly stop singing in unison
the wind ceases
paul looks around the forest
the sudden quiet has got him spooked
his arms and legs stiffen
paul cant even bring himself to move or breathe
paul freaks and whirls around grabbing his shoulder to find clinging to him
he rips it off and sprints for the footpath
paul sprints out of the forest running with blinding speed and adrenaline
he doesnt look back
behind him the wind hisses through the trees again
julia comes up from the basement
she hears coughing coming from the bathroom
julia enters the bathroom
paul is retching and coughing into the toilet
hair plastered to his forehead
pale as death
she goes to him
rubs his shoulders as he coughs again
julia brushes the hair from his forehead
just above his temple is a scab
no bigger than the head of an eraser
identical to the one on julias finger
where did this come from
julia runs her finger over the scab
paul immediately reels from her touch pain shooting through his head furious
julia is shocked by the severity of his reaction
paul holds his head tight
almost near tears
just dont touch it
how long has it been there
ever since my head started to hurt
then i think im hallucinating
what did you see
like it was shed
and all of these metal pieces
julia is terribly concerned now
his description frightens her but she maintains a visage of calm
do you want to see a doctor
i know theres one in santa mira
i can see a doctor in los angeles
then look i want to get out of here okay
lets go home
she squeezes his shoulder and walks into julia pulls out their duffle bags and suitcases
pauls cell phone rings on the table
julia snatches up the phone and answers
then wait a minute slow down i cant understand what youre saying
complete astonishment storms julias face
paul wanders in
who is it
something went wrong
gloomy and overcast
storm clouds are brewing
the range rover pulls down a crowded street
julia is sitting behind the wheel
paul sits on the passenger side leaning against the window his face pressed against the glass
somber and weak
the twisted remains of a car accident has brought everything to a near standstill
police are everywhere
an ambulance is parked along the curb lights flashing
julia leans forward to get a better look
victim presses a white towel against his thigh
blood gushes from it
a huge metal rod sticks out of his leg
the range rover moves past the shredded cars involved in the accident
twisted metal covers the street
summer rain is falling
thunder rolls overhead
the rover pulls up to the sidewalk directly in front of an extremely opulent upper class house
julia turns to paul who sits silently in the passenger seat
he doesnt move
sure you dont want to come with me
im too sick
i need to stay someplace
im worried about leaving you here
shrugs its not like hell disown me
and i really need him right now
julia kisses his cheek
im taking the cell phone
you call me
see a doctor
paul opens the passenger door and steps out into the rain
julia watches him approach the house
then she pulls away from the curb
a nice house
large and affluent
the doorbell a few moments pass before a sullen figure arrives at the front door and pulls it open revealing
standing on the front porch
his wet hair plastered to his forehead rain streaming off his cheeks his handsome face turned pallid and colorless
he manages a sheepish smile
standing at the door is a man in his mid fifties mr
a severe presence with a soured and weathered face
he stares at paul without any sign of emotion
paul notices the slight
he presses onward
a bit haltingly
still hopeful and trying to connect
contd i was hoping we could talk
beat i know we havent done much of that recently but still
beat i was hoping
contd im in a lot of trouble
im getting sick
and i was hoping
beat i was hoping you could help
paul is having difficulty speaking
hes almost reduced to tears as he stands in the cold stinging rain
contd i want to come home
desperate please let me come home
a moment of silence
his father stands steely eyed
his voice is icy and distant
i dont know you
paul is devastated
he can barely utter a sound
im your son
i dont have a son
then i dont know you
he slowly closes the door
paul begins weeping openly
the door is shut in his face
nothing can be heard except for the rain falling outside
julia is standing near the entrance
a figure across the street catches julias attention a homeless man stumbling down the sidewalk talking to himself shaking a rattle
julia turns around searching not immediately recognizing the figure that briskly approaches her its terry
but her once perfect appearance has become harsh and drawn
her blonde hair has been colored dark brown
there are sagging circles under her eyes
her skin is colorless
she moves quickly
julia is shocked
terrys hands tremble
im glad you came
you dont have any idea how scared ive been
why did you change your hair
terry is about to answer when a baby starts crying in the market
fear takes control of her face
we cant stay here
where are you parked
on the street
if we keep moving they might have trouble tracking us
terry takes julias arm and leads her out of the market
terry is moving at a swift pace
she keeps looking back over her shoulder as julia tries to keep up
rain drenches them
what the hell is going on
this almost sends julia reeling
her mouth falls open
theres three things you should remember
what happened to sam
first whenever you see a baby or a kid crying keep moving
children can sense them
thats your warning
warning against who
second they can control anything electrical or mechanical
terry youre not making any sense
third they can change things
they can make you disappear
tell me what happened to sam
i am telling you
terrified they took him
they made him disappear
julia stops walking
a young college student is typing on his powerbook oblivious to the transient sitting on the sidewalk head buried in his knees a sign at his feet reading help me
a soft whirring noise seeping from the computer as the student types
the whirring becomes the humming of machines
the range rover appears on the street and moves past
they take away your identity
people stop remembering you
your place in society vanishes
julia is behind the wheel
terry is devouring a cigarette
thats how they get you
by making people not even care about you anymore
did you try sams parents
did you get the right number this time
the number i called at the bus station was his parents
cryptic we didnt hit a dog on the road
but i saw it
they switched bodies
who are they
terry starts laughing to herself
tears welling in her eyes
you have no idea
no idea what youre dealing with
then they dont even belong here
like machines thats what sam said
like machines with all this skin and moving parts
theyre monsters julia
julia stops at a light
crosses the street in front of them
hes just a yuppie with a cell phone
but terry stiffens in her seat watching him suspiciously
then almost as an aside he winks at her
theres a red
then make a right
just keep driving
julia is growing frightened by terrys paranoia
the rover makes a right turn and cruises down another block
terry keeps her eyes riveted on the people on the sidewalk
shes practically in tears
remember when we hit that thing with the car
hushed it wasnt an accident
it was a set up
they planned it all along
how do you know this
sam told me
he figured everything out
why are they coming after us
what do they want with us
they have flesh and metal parts in their bodies
sometimes they shed what they dont need
but other parts keep getting worn out or lost
so they take people constantly to get new parts
soft thats not possible
they wear the skin
thats why you dont notice them
half of the time theyre wearing peoples skin
or theyre hiding in dark places
julia is horrified
they take other parts too
whatever they need
no sense of compassion
i dont believe this
thats why they came after us
they got joey first
at the cabin
julia is dumbfounded
thats what sam saw
thats why he left
he woke up and got a look at them at what they were doing to joey
stripping him taking his skin off julia pulls over to the curb and stops
who is joey
what are you talking about
amazed you dont remember
there were five of us
he came up in his own car
he was pauls best friend they always wore the same thing for christ sakes
there were only four of us
terry is shaking now
they got to you
they got to you
nobody got to me
terry starts collecting her things
look could you drop me off at my brothers apartment
i need to pick up some things before i go to the airport
where are you going
to see my parents
you cant just leave
terry starts weeping
grabbing her legs and squeezing them
they put things in my legs so they can track me
very concerned terry
what can i do to help you
terry takes her hand
her eyes pleading
please remember me
from the street outside the car the sound of a toddler crying can be heard
terrys head snaps around
she stares out the windshield at the screaming child
contd they found me again
before julia can react terry bolts from the car
julia pushes and shoves her way along the sidewalk
terry is running like a madwoman
pure unabated terror
terry rushes down into a subway entrance
people are crowded on the platform waiting as a bart train rushes into the station
the doors open
passengers move off the train
others get on
julia rushes down the stairs and pushes past the arriving commuters
theres no sign of terry
julia keeps searching
finally she spots terry boarding the bart train
julia rushes forward squirming through the crowd until she reaches the doors just as they slam closed
she looks through the windows trying to find terry amongst the crowd inside
the train starts to move
standing at one of the trains passenger windows his face and palms pressed against the glass is staring directly at her
dark circles around his eyes
he smiles at julia
his teeth are made of metal
julia stands thunderstruck
the boy in the window moves past
the train shoots into the awaiting tunnel
julia is left standing frozen and immobile on the platform
near the subway entrance a homeless man with hooks for hands is convulsing as he sits against the wall
eyes wide open
shaking horribly and staring at nothing
quiet and dimly lit
several of the lights are burnt out leaving the hallway drowning in shadows
the elevator doors open
terry exits and moves quickly down the hallway
her face is terrified
she arrives at an apartment
terry fumbles with her keys
a soft in the hallway
deep and hollow
terry spins around the keys jingling in her hand
the hall appears to be empty and dark
one of the lights overhead is flickering and buzzing softly providing scant illumination
she takes a step back
a soft tinkling sound at her feet
terry looks down to find a few pieces of metal littering the floor
nuts and bolts
alien in design
terrys paranoia rises to a fever pitch
she turns the key in the lock
opens the front door
terry shuts the door
switches on the lights
drops her keys and cell phone on a coffee table
she moves briskly into an open suitcase on the bed
terry snatches up a plane ticket and jams the ticket folder into her purse
slams the suitcase closed
terry leaves the bedroom carrying the suitcase and walks straight towards the front door
she collects her keys and her cell phone from the table
the lights in the apartment simultaneously go out
terry is caught entirely off guard
she spins around to face the living room
terrys breathing quickens
she puts the suitcase down
a crack of thunder reverberates outside
moving with the cautious steps of a small child she walks towards the front door
foot by foot
the only sound is her frightened breathing
she arrives at the peephole and looks out into the empty hall
moving right in front of the door
one of its yellow eyes piercing through
surrounded by midnight skin pierced with metal bolts and rods
the door rattles like its going to break off its hinges
something slams repeatedly against the wood
terry tears through the apartment feet pounding
she rushes into the bedroom
the front door in the living room breaks open
terry slams the bedroom door and locks it
backs away towards the bed when
grabbing hold of her ankle
fused together from rotting flesh human parts and metal pieces
terry pitches forward screaming falling to her hands and knees
the hand starts dragging her under the bed
terry kicks and claws on the floor
somehow manages to free herself from the hands grip
she goes for the window and pulls it open
the entire bed is overturned and tossed aside
terry is immediately drenched by the storm
the door within her bedroom can be heard crashing open followed by a roaring unlike anything on this earth
terry rushes down the fire escape feet banging on the metal steps
but she stops dead in her tracks when she notices standing in the alley far below
looking up at her
a sound rises up behind her
the sound of footsteps banging down the fire escape in horrified oh god
terry desperately goes to a window
she pulls it open stepping inside the banging the apartment floor is being renovated
plastic tarps cover the doors and windows
terry races through the hallway screaming wildly as she pounds on the doors
terry rockets around the corner
she presses the elevator door button frantically
the sound of croaking and hissing fills the hallway
the elevator doors slide open
terry lunges into the elevator hits for the lobby then starts beating frenziedly on the door close button
several shadows appear in the hallway
terry screams wildly and keeps pounding the button
the bizarre hissing becomes a frightful roar just as
the elevator doors pull shut
closing on the unseen things in the hallway
the car starts going down
floor lights blink above the door
terry punches out on the cell phones keypad
nothing comes through the receiver
she dials again
more static over the cell phone
terry has started crying in anguish when the elevator comes to an abrupt halt
the doors stay closed
terry looks above the elevator doors
the floor light reads basement terry starts pressing for the lobby
the elevator wont move
she presses the door open button the alarm button anything at all
shes about to try dialing on the cell phone again when
a heavy thudding sound above the elevator car roof
the light overhead flickers like a candle
terry gazes at the failing light then tracks her eyes towards the trap door in the roof
a few more hollow thumps terry is petrified
she takes a step backward
the light flashes off and on again
creating a strobe light effect
behind her the elevator doors silently pull open
terrys gaze is still focussed on the ceiling trap door
behind her the basement is pitch black
she continues moving backwards towards the open elevator doors step after step completely unaware
in the moment it takes to draw a breath and scream its already over
the light goes out
the lobby is vacant and terribly still
the elevator doors remain closed a few thumping sounds coming from the shaft far below
the sound of a julia is sitting inside of the parked range rover the cell phone pressed against her ear
from phone hello
is this mr
im sorry to call you so late
overlapping who is this
this is julia levin
we met a few days ago at graduation
im a friend of terrys
i dont have a daughter
you must have the wrong number
beat no this is the right number
the man hangs up the phone on the other line
julia stares at the cell phone in stunned confusion until a sharp pain courses through her hand
she flinches and nearly drops the phone
julia checks her pricked finger
the wound has grown
an infected red spot with a open hole in the center
the skin actually seems to be rotting around it allowing the wound to expand like a sinkhole
a small box of aspirin are taken from the shelf
paul tightens his fist around the box shutting his eyes fighting the excruciating the pain in his head
he takes a deep breath and moves to the register
need anything else
the cashier rings him up
four thirty two
paul flips open his wallet
his face drops into shock
theres nothing inside his wallet
no credit cards
no drivers license
not a thing
contd something wrong
paul can barely speak
i mustve brought the wrong wallet
paul walks out of the store
paul stops outside running his fingers through his hair digging them into his skull
shaking his head thats not possible
thats not possible
a shape grabs his shoulder
paul spins around
lady stands behind him
dishevelled and caked with grime
she holds up the drooping sleeve where a hand once was
they took my hand
paul stumbles back
contd weeping they took my hand
paul turns and starts running
faster than hes ever run in his life
disappearing down the dark street
small and trendy
julia sits at an empty booth
staring at various black and white photographs of graduation
the four friends are sitting together on the back porch smiling for the camera
she squeezes her finger to help numb the pain her mind turning
to herself joey
then terry what were you talking about
julia flips to another photograph
a picture of julia paul sam and terry on the ucla campus
dressed for graduation
julia shakes her head
her eyes are locked on the faces of her friends
contd theres four of us
theres only four of us
she studies the picture
julia sits up in her chair
a revelation crosses her face
contd a whisper who took the picture
julia looks like shes falling into a deep hole
her mind is racing for answers
ive been fantasizing about a guy
anyone we know
the blond student sits back on the hood of a sports car
the tattooed s insignia visible on his shoulder
contd there were five of us
he came up in his own car
style text transform none paul smiling his killer grin at julia
wearing his white shirt and gold and blue striped tie
he was pauls best friend the blond student loosens his gold and blue striped tie from his white shirt collar as he undresses
contd they always wore the same thing for christ sakes
julias horrified face
completely lost no
the blond student standing half naked in front of julia
holding a pair of ripped jeans
contd im sorry
i was just using the
ill forgive you this once
julia turns her head and gazes at
sitting in a chair
smoking a cigarette
smiling down at her
its just a fantasy
candles have been placed around the room
paul and terry are asleep on the floor
blood drips over the superman tattoo on joeys shoulder
julia slowly awakens to the sounds of joey screaming over sickening ripping sounds like cloth being torn in half
there are silhouettes on the wall of three figures tearing off pieces of something in the room
moving rapidly and ferociously
julia spots sam screaming across the room
shrieking julia turns her head in the direction of the ripping and tearing sounds
her eyes slowly widen as her mouth drops into a soundless petrified look of horror
a hand with midnight skin six fingers and punctured with steel rods covers her eyes
a plate smashes on the floor
julia is jolted out of her thought looks over to find a waiter picking up the pieces
the lights flicker in the shop
this unnerves julia completely
she starts gathering the photographs together
she becomes aware of the pain in her finger again
looks at the scab
a whisper terrys legs pauls headaches
a thought crashes like thunder in her head
contd oh no
julia quickly grabs a knife from the table
she gets up and walks straight to the ladies restroom
cramped and dirty
julia holds her finger over the sink
with the point of the knifes blade she begins digging into her finger
the pain is immediate
julia grimaces tears forming in her eyes as the wound blossoms bright red
blood drips into the sink julia drops the knife into the sink and pinches the wound
a speck of metal flashes inside the wound julia continues squeezing tears rolling fingernails digging into the wound as
julia starts pulling it out of her finger
the splinter rises from the wound
and rises and rises
more blood spatters into the sink
julia is gasping and crying as the pain becomes excruciating
the glittering splinter is five inches long and growing
the splinter is pulled out
its seven inches long julia drops the splinter into the sink
she moves away from the counter back towards the living room unbelieving horrified
she stumbles towards the door
julia walks out of the restroom
everyone in the coffee shop is staring at her
the lights are dimming
a lack of power
julia forces herself to move
she goes to her table picks up the photographs and suddenly notices that in the graduation pictures julia grabs the photographs and turns around
the customers in the coffee shop are standing now
their eyes are dark shadows
something about the way they stand is completely unnatural
panic begins to settle in
julia quickly walks to the door
the waiter stands behind her
contd menacing whyd you take it out
julia gets the hell out of there
julia bolts out the door and rushes across the street
she reaches her car disarms the alarm and gets inside
julia drops the photos into the passenger seat
starts the car
the cell phone rings
she answers it
paul on a pay phone
theres panic in his voice
where are you
at a pay phone
what about your dad
he wouldnt let me in
he told me he didnt have a son
then julia everything in my wallets gone
between julia and paul
then its already started
julia trains her eyes on the coffee shop
theres not much time
theyre watching me right now
just listen to me
there were five of us at the cabin
beat your best friend was with us
he had blond hair
he had a superman tattoo on his shoulder
i dont know anyone named joey
thats because they erased your memory
if you remembered him
if you remembered what they did to him you might run like sam
that would make it hard for them to hunt you down
they killed him
paul can barely stand up
his skull is pounding
they really exist paul
they use human beings for parts
i cant take this
what you saw in the forest wasnt a hallucination
theyve been watching us the entire time
i cant theres a tracking device in your head
right where the scab is
her words sound chilling in the night air
foreboding and deadly
paul is filled with dread
they want us for parts
thats why theyre tracking us
they take the skin and wear it
just let me think for a second
they already got sam and terry
and now theyre making us disappear
then think about it
it cant be true
it is true
paul becomes upset
he nods with grave understanding
what are we gonna do
we have to get back home
theyre all over the place but we can make it
where are you
just below union square
right near the cable cars
where they turn them around
theres a subway station near there
i can see it
wait for me
at the top of the stairs
ill be there in five minutes
i love you
in pain i love you
paul hangs up
julia tosses down the cell phone
the car engine stops
she tries to start the car but it the engine wont turn over
just as shes about to try a second time she looks out the windshield
julia frantically tries to start the car again
she rips open the door
julia takes off running
the shapes pursue
julia turns a corner and runs straight into an intersection
as a bus barrels towards her
julia barely leaps out of the way as the bus screeches to a halt nearly running her down
she rises to her feet as the bus starts moving again
several of the passengers have their faces pressed against the windows
dark circles around their eyes
julia keeps going
the pursuing customers from the coffee shop are marooned on the opposite corner by traffic
they stand motionless
watching her escape
a long flight of stone stairs leads down to the bart and muni stations below
paul sits down on the steps
julia charges down the sidewalk
weaving past bystanders
as she runs julia brushes past the little girl from sams graduation party
she watches julia race off into the crowd with cold soulless eyes
paul is sitting still
his head cradled in his hands
a shape appears in front of him
paul looks up
julia races across the intersection and streaks towards the subway station entrance
paul is nowhere to be found
the stairs are empty
julia looks around desperately
she cant find him in the crowds on the sidewalks
she turns and looks down the stairs towards the open entryway to the subway system
paul is walking through the entryway
a friend with him is patting him on the shoulder
just after paul has disappeared through the entryway the friend turns around
his lips are parched pitch black eyes bulging his features somehow more twisted and unfamiliar
his face twitches as he stares coldly at julia and he runs
small pieces of metal drop from sams pants legs as he disappears through the entryway
contd she frantically rushes down the stairs
contd she rushes through the entryway
the upper level is almost completely empty save a few kids and late night commuters
julia is hysterical now
the first time weve seen her lose control
she looks around frantically
spots paul and sam going down the escalator together
julia rushes towards the turnstiles
a guard steps out of his booth
you need a ticket
she keeps going
paul and sam reach the bottom of the escalators
they move towards the platform
the lights start twinkling
confused i thought you said shed be here
sam smirks back mute
and grabs him by the throat
the lights go julia bolts down the escalator
she reaches the platform and rushes to the center
theres nobody else down there
the lights are flickering
slowly they return to normal
a train rumbles through the station
julia moves to the opposite side and looks
resting on the tracks leading into the tunnel are a trail of metal pieces
exactly like the ones from the cabin
julia looks back
the guard is coming down the escalator
without hesitation she jumps down to the tracks
moving quickly and bending down to avoid being seen she rushes into the awaiting subway tunnel
drowned in shadows
an unnatural silence fills the tunnel
julia moves cautiously amongst the tracks
eyes scanning the darkness
following the trail of discarded metal
julia spins around
a few more hissing sounds rise from electrical sparks on the tracks
blue light flashes within the tunnel
then it ceases
she turns back to continue her search wind sifting through her hair when she finds at the base of the subway wall
julia reaches down and palms a few metal pieces at the base of the hole
she peers inside
a dull flickering light flashes within
julia takes a calming breath
she moves into the hole
a narrow and claustrophobic space
julia squirms through the confined space pulling herself towards the flashing light
julia pulls herself through another opening and finds herself standing in the threshold of a corridor
both the walls and floor are constructed of crude metal grates and long pipes
anything could be hiding within
she moves slowly into the corridor a strobe light flickering around her
she gropes towards another opening
the sound of her terrified breathing is slowly replaced by the rhythmic humming of steam rises from the pipes
bathing the stairwell in mist
the fluorescent lights above are glimmering in the darkness
julia stands at the top of the stairwell
she cant even see the bottom of the steps
carefully she starts moving down
her hand gripping the metal railing
the humming of machines grows louder
her foot accidentally kicks a few pieces of metal on the steps
a light clinking as the metal scatters down ahead of her
the humming of machines is closer now
just beyond the sheathing clouds of blue and white mist
the metal railing is suddenly replaced by human bones
julia pulls her hand away from the railing
looks skyward and discovers more bones are being used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams
shutting her eyes in fear
starts to lose control
from somewhere within she manages to steady herself
keeps going through the awaiting steam curtain at the bottom
the steam parts to reveal a dark space
cold and damp
julia moves into the main hallway stumbling through a hallway that can best be described as a living nightmare
mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned together into a wall pulsating with the heartbeat of machines that saturates the entire hallway
steam jets into the hallway intermittently from the pipes
creating great clouds
julia is beyond horrified
her face registers a numbness
complete and total astonishment
human bones and body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that its impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical begins
she enters another corridor
her face is struck by a jet of hissing steam
she presses onward
slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor
another blast something leaps out of the middle of it
julia whirls back around a corner pressing flat against the wall as a black shape moves through the steam
movements that suggest nothing by chaos and madness
the shape hisses and croaks in the hallway
she doesnt even breathe
the hissing stops
she gradually turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood
as she looks around the corner
the shape has disappeared
carefully she keeps going forward
drenched in water and sweat
slipping through the steam clouds that mask another entrance
a massive room where empty human skins are dangling from hooks complete and preserved from head to toe
the skins sway and rock gently in the draft
thousands of them
julia moves towards the center of the room
a large operating table awaits
but the surface of the table is sunken like a water basin
next to the table is a pedestal littered with bloody instruments
julia notices that pauls torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table
shirt shredded to a rag
sneakers orphaned nearby
jeans spattered with blood
her breathing quickens
her heart pounding
she reaches the foot of the table
paul is lying within the basin completely naked and partially covered with littered body parts
organs and entrails
the basin is filled with water and blood
an immobile form is resting next to him
julia moves quickly
she tries to wake him up
paul wake up
his nose crinkles slightly
contd wake up
she grabs him and lifts him up
he starts coughing
contd youve gotta hurry
julia grabs his jeans
she helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on
a skinned hand grabs hers
julia yelps a scream
the other form a thing in the basin rises and turns
slicked with blood
empty sockets where the eyes should be
mouth falling open
a horror that shouldnt be alive
julia screams again
her free hand grabs a hook from the pedestal and swings the blade into the things neck
blood fountains up
the thing begins shrieking
with paul leaning on her for support julia rapidly heads for the door
julia navigates her way through the hallways
moving blindly through sudden jets of steam the sound of machines around them
paul leans on her his eyes remaining closed coughing and stumbling
racing through the halls
the steam clouds suddenly exploding into her view
julia reaches the stairwell and helps paul climb the steps
she looks back over her shoulder
nothing behind them
julia stops at the corridor opening
the strobe light flashes within
the corridor looks empty
nothing but pipes and shadows
were almost there
julia turns to paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth
he stares back at her
a moment of sheer horror
julia reels back into the corridor
pressed flat against the wall
sliding towards the crawl space opening
paul starts advancing into the corridor
grinning with teeth that flash with every click of the strobe light
she keeps sliding away
he grabs his chest and rips it open tearing the covering skin apart as he would a shirt
a menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it
julia tries to scream
she cant make a sound
paul tears the skin covering his chest wider
pulling it away
stripping himself clean
julia reaches the crawl space
the last pieces pauls skin are torn off
the thing that had been pretending to be paul stands in his place
only brief glimpses are allowed by the strobe light
an abysm of immemorial lunacy consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal
a human heart beating within exposed ribs
bones combined with pulleys and rods
the face of a skull
a contradiction of all matter and cosmic order
julia slips back into the crawl space
still trying to scream
julia drags herself through the crawl space
julia squeezes herself through the exposed hole
she kicks to her feet and tears off into the tunnel
julia has almost reached the platform opening for the train
julia runs directly parallel to the subway platform
the lights alongside of her start flickering and go out one by one as she advances
she reaches the opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform pulling herself up
the platform goes dark
appearing out of the far tunnel are a dozen dark shapes scampering along the walls and running on all fours across the tracks
their characteristics barely visible
julia kicks back as the shrieking things bear down on her yellow eyes flaring in the dark metal teeth flashing
julia tries to run for the escalator but the things cover the walls behind the tracks
ready to spring
finally one of the monsters does leap towards her
reducing the monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal
the other creatures on the tracks are also run down
julia watches as the train rumbles past
and then silence
nothing is left except for a few swirling newspapers
the lights flicker and come back to life
rising up to her feet rescued from death by chance julia starts backing towards the escalator
her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns and races up
rain has started falling again
pelting the stairs
julia dashes up the stairwell and sprints into the street
she doesnt look back
the rain falls so heavily that it creates a dense blue fog which shrouds the entire street
julia appears through the storm running towards a telephone booth on the street corner
she rips open the door steps inside and slams the door shut
she drops a few quarters into the phone
dark and still
lightning frames the windows
the picture of julia and her mother rests near a phone as the line rings
guy comes downstairs and answers the portable
contd bewildered is anyone there
a flash of lightning outside
beat they might still be around
feeding on power from the phone lines
can you hear me
over phone i cant hear you
daddy help me help me please
more static resounds over the phone
guy hesitates a moment then returns the portable to the cradle
the line is abruptly cut off
julia begins to cry
she covers her face with her hands
the tears roll through her fingers
guy stares at the phone for a moment
a strange feeling
something isnt right
he thinks a moment
then shakes it off and heads upstairs moving directly past the picture next to the phone
lightning flashes across the pictures glass frame
the afternoon rush of people trying to get home
three college students come down the escalator into the station
connor is among them now eighteen and wearing a berkeley sweatshirt
his friends are barry and why the hell didnt we bring the car
you wanna pay for gas
better than this shit
i hate bart
he has a point
i made the mistake of trying to use the bathroom
what do these people do
stand with their ass hanging over the toilet and aim
connor checks his watch
party started an hour ago
well make it
trace of sarcasm yeah connor
we might get there right after the kegs dry out
resigned i should study anyway
calls out from across the platform
he turns around and scans the crowd locating a ragged figure that moves quickly towards him
with her dirty clothing and sunken eyes it takes a moment to register
this is julia
her skin is pale
her hair is stringy and knotted
ive been looking for you
just ignore her
they tried to get me
but i managed to get away
ive always managed to get away
a train rushes into the station
connor is speechless
sorry but youll help me
you will help me
connor raises his hands and backs towards the train as the doors slide open
his friends are already aboard
dont you remember
he gets into the train
his friends are laughing
connor turns to his friends with a look of smirking disbelief
how the fuck did she know my name
she heard me say it
overlapping its julia
im your sister
the doors slide closed in her face
julia begins beating on the doors to be heard
connor and his friends are a little freaked but theyre still laughing at her
the train starts to move
people inside move in front of the doors and block julias view of her brother
contd julia runs alongside the train
still beating on the doors
her face awash with tears
contd shrieks the train picks up speed
julia is left behind
the grinding of the wheels is heard as the train moves into the subway tunnel
the sound of machines drowns out every other sound and consumes all
