written by eran creevy a large empty coach all dull beige seats and wood veneer makes its way along a stretch of motorway
at the back of the coach we see a lone passenger
his eyes closed head drooped
suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose
its no use chris cant sleep
he pulls up a set of head phones puts them on and presses play on his mp
long shot from the front of the coach the drivers gruff face to the left empty seats filtering away from camera chris head peaking above a back seat
we hear the music from his mp begin to play
its noel mckoys brighter day a northern soul track thats reminiscent of motown and comparable to the vocal sound of marvin gaye
the track will play over the following opening scenes the credits fading subtly in and out in white text
we follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through dudlowe a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the second world
we reveal shifty pakistani as he makes his way through those morning streets
he blows on his hands to warm them up
suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence making a short cut
birds eye view on trevor perry average looking thickset pallid skin lying beneath the surface of the bath water holding his nose
chris stares out of the window
the music still playing on his mp
the coach makes a sharp left turn the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign dudlowe new town
glen a severe almost cruel face emptys about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table
jasmine pretty with out make up dressed in a white dressing gown prepares breakfast
shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land jumping over a fence at the end
suddenly jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits
in an agreeably decorated bedroom trevor dresses for work
he climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans no real enthusiasm life seems to hold no motivation
chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land shifty just walked across
glen splits the cocaine into two piles
trevor sits on the edge of the bed staring at the floor
his mind is racing thinking about the morning ahead of him
jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water
the coach pulls away to reveal chris his bag slung over his shoulder
he turns and walks off
trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror he rubs his face he seems a little more with it
glen opens a tub of glucose and empties a measure into one half of the cocaine
he mixes it carefully
shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house
chris makes his way through the streets bag slung over his shoulder
he looks around at the old place
soaking it in
glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes it with citric acid
he sucks it up into a syringe
shifty quietly opens the back door to the house
glen carries the syringe to loretta pretty but with bad facial burns on the side of her face
he injects the cocaine mix into her arm
she lays back on the bed taking on the rush
chris walks along a residential road in his hand a piece of paper with a scribbled address
he finds the right house
he stands there for a moment then hits stop on his mp
our soulful soundtrack comes to an end
he pulls down his head phones walks to the door and knocks gently
shifty stands at the table sorting through letters
he hears the knock and walks to open it
he takes off his jacket puts it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal chris
fucking hell man
shifty cant help but smile
a smile creeps across chris face
yes rude boy
you alright geezer
come in man come in
shifty and chris embrace
good to see you mate
good to see you too geezer
chris stands splashing his face from the sink
his bag perched on the cistern
he looks at himself in the mirror
chris walks into shiftys bedroom
he puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt
he looks around at the room
new dvd player lcd on the wall a new game console dvds cds lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side books about business books about film a perfectly
stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word paid scribed across them
a picture of mohammed ali next to a picture of allah
he approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull featureless dudlowe new town
he stands staring
chris walks into the kitchen to see shifty getting breakfast ready
shifty turns to face him
you alright son
yeah i just needed to splash my face freshen up a bit
have you slept
did i fuck
mate neither have i
i just got back from some girls yard
you got a bird
just some fucking booty call

they both laugh
shifty lays sausages into a pan
yeah shes alright you know

you always loved your titties bruv
you know that
shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan
mate do you mind halal
no no thats sweet mate whatever
were you on just one bus
no sorry two
i had to change at luton
shifty covers the sausages with a lid
we hear someone moving about upstairs
shifty quickly walks over to the freezer opens the door reaches into the back and pulls out a large bag of sweet corn
ive got a few things to do today geezer you can stay here if you want just chill out
he rummages about and gradually one by one pulls out tightly cellophane wrapped bags of coke and crack
he places them in the pockets of his hooded top
chris watches shifty closely but doesnt say anything
or you can come with me
whispers does your brother know you keep those there
shifty shakes his head
whispering you not worried
mate he doesnt eat vegetables
shifty walks past chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm
apart from in a pot noodle
we follow trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and walks into a large smartly decked kitchen an eight year old boy freddie circles the kitchen table smashing a
darth vader into passing stools
katie a three year old baby girl eats breakfast and jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst talking on the phone
on phone shes living like a drifter babe im telling you shes split
i know she did
but she stays at mikes in the week and then shes back at stefans at the weekend
with the kids to baby katie darling stop banging your bowl
trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out for him
his stomach churns
cold sweat smothers his brow
on phone neither knows about the other and then she expects me she drops to a whisper to fucking cover for her normal volume stefans my mate for christs sake
im not getting caught up in that whole mess to boy freddie sit down and finish your breakfast
this is too much for trevor
he turns and walks away from the table
on phone and she has a go at me for taking on too much she laughs then without looking up babe im cooking you some eggs
slam the front door crashes shut hes gone his breakfast untouched
nothing trevors just walked out without touching his breakfast
i dont know i thought so anyway
trevor soaks it in deep breaths panic subsiding
he approaches his work van
palmer builders merchant inscribed on the side
he gets in suddenly his mobile rings he answers
whats the matter
off screen katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray
nothing im fine
why didnt you say good bye
you were gassing away to nicola
and why didnt you touch your breakfast
im not hungry
off screen freddie yells
whats the matter with you
she runs the tap water gushes on to the discarded eggs
wheres the grey suitcase
i cant hear you babe
i want to start getting stuff ready for next week wheres the grey suitcase
ill find it when i get home
its all right babe ill get it
jasmine ill get it when i get home
babe its fine ill get it down
stern he breathes in hard takes a moment to calm down and then starts the engine
jasmine drops the phone by her side shocked at trevors temperament and watches through the front room window as he drives away
shiftys laying out the breakfast
at that moment rez shiftys brother walks in
mid s portly
he sees chris
motherfucker the return of the white man
chris stands and goes to embrace rez but rez walks past and grabs a glass of orange juice from the side
how you doing rez good to see you man
i wondered why i could hear voices
i thought hed brought home a rent boy again
shut up you prick
to chris you look like a rent boy
what are you talking about
points at chris
that top cost more than my education

sings cold blooded
shifty lays down three plates of breakfast
rez fakes a heart attack
soak it in fat boy
i take it this doesnt happen often
you know what im emotional wheres my camera bring me my camera
quick man quick
yeah fucking laugh it up
dont worry i will
shifty sits down and they begin their food
trevor sits at the wheel parked in a residential street
he dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message this number is currently unavailable please try agai
he puts down the phone and sits there waiting agitated
all three of them eat in silence
chris eyes dart occasionally to rez who pays no attention to anything but the food
there is an uncomfortable air in the room
trevor does a line of cocaine of the tip of his car key
we see that he doesnt have a huge amount left in his wrap
shiftys putting away breakfast chris and rez sit at the table
rez stabs away with a tooth pick measuring up chris who reads a magazine
to chris do you think ive put on weight
chris looks up
do you think ive put on weight
to shifty i told you i havent put on that much weight
shifty lets out a sarcastic laugh
how long since youve been back
shifty sits back down and answers for chris

how come your back whats the deal
i invited him to a party
mate rachel and serena
rez pauses thinking
chris clocks him with an almost icy stare
chris looks back down at his magazine
rez knows he hit a raw nerve
an uncomfortable silence
shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic
to rez you remember rachel you fucking lunged her at jazzbo browns
yeah yeah you went in for the kill and she lent away like she was doing the fucking limbo
chris is back in the conversation
her ponytail swept the floor
shifty and chris touch fists
you boys need to get your facts straight
she fucking lunged me
you couldnt even remember who she was five minutes ago
shifty and chris crack up laughing
to chris i wouldnt mind if he did it discreetly but he lunged her from about three feet
shifty mimics rezs historic lunge rez starts to laugh at the memory of it covering his face with his hands
trevor tries the mobile again but gets the same message
he throws his phone onto the passenger seat and exits the car
they still sit around the table
to rez you can come along if you want
sarcastically yeah i feel like it now dont i
suddenly the door bell goes
to shifty get that its probably your viagra delivery
shifty opens the door
shifty steps out and pulls the door to behind him
rez stares at chris whos still reading a magazine
so come on why are you back
chris looks up at him
hes not ready for this question
because of the erm because of the party
theres been hundreds of parties mate whats so special about this one
i dunno i just wanted to see shifty didnt i
rez just stares at him
chris looks back at the magazine trying to pretend hes reading
i was trying to bell you geezer your phones off
yeah i know mate
trevor what do you want
trevor doesnt say anything just nods his head as if shifty should know what hes talking about
shifty closes his eyes taking stock

trevor looks a little uncomfortable

still watching chris rez speaks
for some reason
i dunno why
he still thinks of you as his best mate
he gets up to leave
why dont you try acting like one
trevor goes to walk away

yeah no worries im sorry man
shifty walks in shutting the door
rez walks past him to go upstairs
who was that
nothing geezer wanted to talk to me about a job
rez ascends the stairs
what did you say

shifty goes to walk off
rez reaching the top of the stairs calls down
mum and dads

shifty looks agitated
im going to this fucking party
you can be there at seven

shifty stands there seething and walks away
trevor sits in his van by the telephone box waiting
shifty and chris stand in the hallway putting on their jackets
they go to leave when shifty stops and considers something
actually lets go out the back way itll be quicker
they head for the garden
he taps his finger on the steering wheel
every second an eternity
shifty and chris walk for a moment in silence
we gonna see your mum and dad later
i just heard
i wasnt being nosey i just heard rez
chris doesnt want to push the subject any further
theres silence as they walk
do you know theyve ignored me for about a year

trevor drives slowly past the house to see rez putting out the rubbish
rez turns around and stares at trevor
trevor looks away and drives off
jasmine sits on the toilet she opens a pregnancy test and urinates onto it
freddie is on his games console
hes at the controls of a racing game
its on really loud
holding up the pregnancy test jasmine sees it turn to a plus sign
shes pregnant again
tight on the screen as freddies computerised car screeches around a corner
jasmine stares forward her face fretful
freddies car smashes loudly against a barrier
sitting staring suddenly jasmine notices something on the tiled surface
she rubs her finger over it to reveal the residue of a white powder
the game is loud
echoing through the house
she dabs finger with tongue her face sours
she was almost hoping she was wrong
freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent
jasmines eyes are alive with rage the tv bellows out suddenly she stands pulls up her kickers and steams towards freddies room
screaming freddie little face is totally bewildered
shifty and chris approach a clapped out red four door vw golf circa
as they loom closer glen exits the car from the back
what you saying you fucking rag head you alright bad boy

shiftys almost exasperated with glen already
no i havent no

glen grabs shifty and pulls him to one side
his face is close to shiftys ear his insipid breath hot

shifty watches glen
wheres the gear
lennys got it
as shifty walks to the car he discreetly backhands a roll of money to glen
seated in the drivers seat sits lenny a frail man eyes sunken hair thinning
his denim jacket giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking corpse
seated next to him is loretta
shes pulling out a crack pipe itching to take a hit
shifty leans through the window and in one swift move takes a package from lenny slipping it into his jacket and drops a pile of cash into his lap
you alright loretta
rez lays down a prayer mat
he kneels down and begins to pray
glen stands smoking staring at chris
suddenly glen speaks
i swear i know you from somewhere
chris can feel glens eyes on him
i do i know you from somewhere
chris stays silent
dyou used to knock out pills
dismissive yeah now and again
glen carries on staring at him
yeah yeah i know where i fucking know you from

glen laughs at his own joke
chris looks furious
shifty walks back over
right you done
shifty nods good
he takes a final drag on his fag dont go blowing up any fucking tube trains
glen walks back to the car
chris throws shifty a look and storms off shifty follows after him
viewing the action from the dashboard we see glen enter the rear door
loretta puffing away on a crack pipe passes it to lenny
what are we waiting for
give me a fucking break im rushing my tits off
lenny attempts to start the car
wheres the keys babe
lets just go lenny
im freaking out
lenny having found the keys starts the car simultaneously tooting the horn and igniting the window wipers
they drive off frog hopping the vw down the road
yeah its a good job were not making a fucking scene
chris and shifty turn a corner into a row of garages
chris stands there for a moment his fists clenched
mate are you alright
yeah im fine
whats the matter what did he say
geezer dont worry about just

trevor makes his way across muddy terrain to a porta cabin and lets himself in
we follow him into see bob moran portly sitting at a desk another gentleman in a suit and hard hat stands before the desk
bob spots trevor
no no no no no no no
bob comes around from his side of the desk
no trevor no
bob just hear me out
get out of my office
bob please ive paid out on all the materials ive lost money
you should have thought about that before you started bringing drugs onto my site
you owe me money
i owe you fuck all

fuck off trevor
bob turns and walks out the porta cabin
bob ignores him
bob i need this money
bob stays quiet approaches a workman and starts talking to him
trevor stands behind them
bob turns to him and puts out his hand
thanks for coming today trevor well definitely be in touch
bobs hand hangs there
trevor looks at him to the hand
bob turns away and carries on talking
trevor stands for a moment then turns and walks away
trevors face is awash with emotion it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it together
shifty and chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a skate park the camera observing them from behind
shifty hands chris a rolled spliff
shifty doesnt say anything doesnt want to push chris
was that loretta martin in that motor
i used to fancy her big time when we were kids
yeah i remember
she loves a wrongun though dont she
loves a wrongun
what happened to her face
injected her with some fucking cocktail
smack i think
he passed out first
she passed out
but apparently she was lying up against a radiator
the fucking thing came on full whack
she was so out of it she didnt even know it was on
the paramedics had to peel her off
chris looks back out over the estate
shiftys phone starts ringing
he looks at the screen it reads trevor p mob
he hits reject
trevor gets the answering machine
he smashes out at his dashboard
rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine and clumsily throws them in
he pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine
he tries to wedge it back in but it doesnt want to go
rez gets down on his knees and tries again to no avail
he looks in the gap and sees something
he sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around
he has something slowly rez pulls out a large see through watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack
rez sits back against the machine just staring at it
shifty and chris just sit
suddenly chris notices something
that fucking thing
shifty and chris approach an extreme sports park ride that helps build upper strength
at either end of a raised beam are two handles
what does it fucking do
chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it
mate grab the other end
shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to chris suddenly they both lift off the ground
theyre both cracking up laughing loving it
on jasmines kitchen floor just outside the connecting bathroom are stacked a variety of toiletry goods
the sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out
jasmine her dressing gown grubby and soaked cleanses scrubs and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed
shes purging her haven washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum
a fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms
shifty and chris stand before a racing green door upon which a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number eight
shifty knocks on the door
he stares at the emblem of the cat
fucking cat lovers
i cant stand people who feed their cats
fucking red snapper
or goose liver because they say the fucking things fussy
its a fucking cat
wait until you see this
starve the fucking thing for a week and itll eat a condom do you know what i mean
then they stand for a second waiting
shifty knocks again
sorry about this geez
mate its cool
i didnt wanna drag you around all day
shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox
he sees a shadow approaching
he stands back up
the latch snaps echoing down the clinical looking hallway
we follow shifty through a corridor deprived of light and colour
valerie who leads the way is considerably smaller
we open into the front room and valeries revealed for the first time
at with long arms book ended by bony hands and a sculptured face she smacks of an ageing goth and is clearly an old hippie her brain starched by lsd
sleeping cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards
valerie looks towards chris
valerie this is chris hes erm hes an old friend of mine we grew up together
we go way back
so its cool you know
how you doing
he offers a hand that she takes politely
a moment of uncomfortable silence
i called yesterday but you were out
i dunno it was probably about two in the afternoon
i was in all day
you must have been asleep
no no i was awake i didnt sleep
i dunno then
did you say two oclock
are you sure it wasnt two thirty
it may have been
i was out on the balcony at two thirty
but i was in here at two
ill make us some tea
yeah thatll be sweet
chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front room
chintzy ornaments of cats
he picks up a framed photo of her daughter loretta in better days fresh faced before the scars ready to take on the world
he looks slightly shocked to see this
chris sits in a sunken armchair and looks around the room
he looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair
he moves his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor not moving just solid as if frozen
it dawns on chris that all the cats in the room are stuffed
chris sits back in the chair suddenly from next door the deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the wall
its so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat ornaments rattle
valerie prepares the tea whilst shifty leans against the counter top
how you been alright
yeah im alright babe you alright
yeah im alright
silence as valerie prepares the tea
she visited you yet
not for a long time shifty
not seen her for a long time really darling
shifty walks over to valerie and starts helping her make the tea
he seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen
he places a hand on her arm
shell come back one day
they carry on making the tea
the drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall
a fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink
shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before val
chris watches with intent
he almost cant believe what hes seeing
she opens the cellophane and places down a small yellowy lump
then carefully she fashions the can into a smoking utensil
at that moment one of her cat ornaments falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass
valerie walks over picks up the china tabby and places it carefully back on the side
she sits back down clearly distressed by the music
were tight on the can as valerie lifts the paraphernalia to her mouth and takes a hit a small grimace etched across her lips
she gestures with her hand offering chris some
no no im fine
look val were gonna have to do one
shifty nods at chris for them both to leave
the thudding bass echoes out as they exit the flat
chris looks slightly unsettled by what hes seen
shifty shuts the door to valeries behind him
they go to walk off when suddenly shifty stops dead in his tracks
he pauses for a while and then shouts to chris who has carried on walking
geezer give me a minute
chris turns to see shifty pulling up the sleeve on his jacket
shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to unhook the latch
the door swings slowly open the drum n bass booming out
the camera follows
were introduced to a dark hallway clothes magazines and cds litter the floor
shifty peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway a mattress with no sheets
shifty carries on down the hallway
reaching a door he slowly pushes it open to reveal a grotty front room
on the tv a violent movie scene plays out the sound turned down
a wiry looking year old otis sits on the sofa rolling a spliff absorbed by the films images
a chavvy looking bird sits to his left
shifty cool as a cucumber rolls into the front room straight up to the stereo and turns it off
the young kid sits there just staring a spliff held in his two hands totally flummoxed
shifty stares him out
shifty looks about at the room
whats your name
where do you get your weed from
it aint mine my erm my mate left it he left it here
i could phone him if you want hell sort you out

chris stands waiting he looks uncomfortable

otis looks at his girlfriend and back to shifty utterly confused
chris watches a young mum below she cant be more than pregnant and with another baby in a pram
he looks saddened by the girl
he turns and walks into the flat
im gonna sell you your weed half price and your gonna keep this noise down
with threat at that moment otis and his girlfriend look up to see chris standing in the doorway
his presence adds menace to the situation
yeah alright yeah
because if i hear one word of complaint from next door just one single complaint ill come back here and ill take your tv ill take your stereo and ill
shove em up your birds arse
he lets the words sink in
the girl looks a little shocked
do you understand me
yeah yeah its cool im sorry man i didnt know i had it on loud i would have turned it down im sorry
shifty stares otis out
otis looks away
shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on otis wall
call me if you need any more weed
he walks into the hallway past chris
almost disdain you dont miss a fucking trick
you know it
shifty and chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block shiftys phone vibrates
shifty hits the reject button
chris follows behind
that was all a bit fucking surreal
what dyou mean
i cant believe you just sold crack to miss marple and struck a deal with blazing squad
shifty laughs as they carry on descending
how old is she
shes been doing drugs longer than weve been alive

chris looks at him unsure if hes joking

they both laugh
jasmine is at the kitchen table with freddie and katie who are doing potato painting
jasmine is dialing her mobile
she presses it to her ear
trevor is parked up in his van just staring out
we see his phone vibrating on the dash board
her tone is cold distant
wheres the credit card

he puts down the phone
jasmine sits there for a moment slightly distracted then carries on painting with the kids her mind elsewhere
shifty and chris walk in silence
chris looks about at the buildings his eyes searching across the domain that he once knew so well

no i didnt
i thought itd be a surprise
chris looks a little uncomfortable

at that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes heading toward them
the siren blares out
chris and shifty caught between a rock and a hard place turn and sprint
chris runs suddenly shifty overtakes
chris is fast but shiftys like a whippet
shifty swerves down a side lane chris follows
maliks legging it down an alleyway he throws the bag over a wall and goes over after it he vaults landing knee deep in a shitty garden pond
shifty and chris sprint the police close behind
this is bollocks
shifty vaults a brick wall chris follows
the drop on the other side is far deeper than expected they hit the floor hard
suddenly they see something that grabs their attention
shifty and chris come swerving around the corner on the crappest kids bikes youve ever seen
shiftys knees are near his chin and chris bike is pink with a fairy flag whipping off the back
its not perfect but its better than running
shifty starts cracking up laughing
chris face looks a little more serious however
he doesnt find this all quite as funny as shifty
shifty sits in an underpass
random graffiti tarnishes the walls behind them their bikes lent against the wall
chris is stood up leaning on his knees breathing hard
mate im telling you this is no way to live
chris sits down next to shifty
im serious mate you need to get away from this shit come and live with me for a bit
shifty looks at chris and reaches into his pocket pulling out a pack of fags

he walks over to loretta and pulls back the sheets
he leans over and starts kissing her all over she tries to ignore him but hes licking her ear grinding his crotch into her arse
glen im not in the mood
he doesnt listen and pulls down her knickers
theres a silence between the two of them
shifty looks as if hes mulling something over in his head
if manchesters so full of gal how come you havent got a bird yet

i just havent been able to get my head around it since serena
mate that was four years ago
trevors makes his way through the lifeless avenues of dudlowe a repetitive new york house tune plays out trevor does a line of coke off the tip of a credit
in the distance we can hear the faint resonance of traffic and far away cries from a childrens playground

shifty soaks in the question

we see trevor walk back to the van in his hand he has a can of beer
getting in he settles down and begins to unwrap his gram of coke on the passenger seat
he places down the can to take a hit when suddenly he knocks it spilling beer all over the cocaine
no no no no oh fuck oh fucking hell
hes at it
his fingers dabbing at the clammy remnants fingering it into his gums and teeth
trevor gets out hes furious and kicks the side of the van
we see shifty and chris approach a house shifty leads the way through the gate
trevors driving full of desperation
he phones another number

blair and chris laugh

shifty sits back in his chair thinking
trevor almost fanatical eyes searching malik in the back of the car looking anxious offering directions
trevor scours the streets malik in the back
the house tune thumping out
blair sniffs up a line of coke and offers some to shifty and chris who decline
the mellow tunes plays out
chris passes the spliff to blair who takes a deep drag
shifty sits back and looks at the clock on the wall
he thinks for a moment
he looks at the lines of coke lined up on blairs table
he looks back at the clock
chris is watching shifty
i tell you what
i could fucking smash one of your mums currys
shifty looks at chris straight in the eyes
do you think she would have made food
we could still make it man
shifty looks at chris
rez stands in the hallway of his parents house we can see shiftys parents in the kitchen chatting to an elderly gentleman in a suit
rez looks at his phone it reads shafiq mobile
he looks at it for a while
rez its shifty yeah

shifty and chris walk

rez puts down the phone
he stands there for a while thinking then walks into the kitchen to join his parents and their guest
silence as trevor and malik drive
suddenly trevor notices shifty and chris walking down a grass verge making their way beneath the underpass
he brings the van to a halt at the side of the street
he exits the van leaving malik sitting in the back passenger seat slightly non plussed
shifty and chris walk through the tunnel from the far end we see the shadow of a heavyset man approaching
shifty and chris walk unfazed
shifty recognises the guy
under his breath oh shit
trevor appearing from the gloom walks directly towards shifty
where you been geezer ive been trying to get hold of you
he stops about a foot away from shifty
too close for comfort
shifty takes a step back
ive been busy mate
trevor assesses chris
i need to get hold of some gear

trevors face drops

he pushes shifty hard
chris steps up

trevors on shifty and has him pinned up against the wall his hefty hand gripped around his neck suddenly he brings a stanley knife up to his temple
empty your pockets
empty your mate what are you doing

trevor think about what youre doing man
trevor edges the knife harder into shiftys neck
slowly shifty surrenders the large bag of coke and a cellophane bag of crack with about two grand in cash
why do you lie to me you prick why do you tell me you werent fucking carrying
trevor you need to calm down
trevors eyes are bulging face crimson with rage his knife nestling at the tip of shiftys adams apple
empty your fucking other pockets
shifty does what trevor says
and the inside pockets you prick
at that moment trevor lowers his knife shifty takes heed and grabs him swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into trevors face
they fall into a messy clinch but their now facing the opposite way
chris and shifty turn and sprint as fast as possible
trevor falls to his knees scrambling for the drugs
jasmine is in the front room ironing
in front of her she has two suit cases laid out perfectly
she keeps and eye on the kids who are still painting
she presses one of trevors shirts perfectly
shifty and chris come to rest behind a gathering of bushes
their lungs on fire as they grab for air
shifty looks down at his top and realises hes bleeding
mate are you alright
chris reaches to help him but shifty swats away his hand
get off me man

shifty turns and steams off leaving chris seething
trevor gets back in the van wiping the blood from his nose with the sleeve of his shirt and breathing heavily
hes counting the money looking in the bag of drugs pay dirt
hes a bundle of nervous energy
off screen who dyou fucking rob cuba
trevor spins round in his seat
what are you doing
i thought you wanted me to wait
trevor starts to laugh its a nervous display almost relief
sort me out with some out that he nods to the coke
whats it worth
malik considers puts his hand in the bag and pulls out a camcorder he nicked earlier with a bunch of tapes
in a respectable dining room sit shiftys parents and mr
their silence is awkward as they sit waiting for shifty
shiftys mum pours mr
ahmed some tea
trevor takes out a wrap places a huge pile on the end of a credit card and tries to snort the lot in one go
his broken nose proves difficult blocked by clotted blood so he eats the remainder
rez sits on a stool drinking a cup of tea he tries to ring shifty but gets no answer
rezs face shows frustration
shifty walks down the path and opens the front door calling out
the house is empty
shiftys on the phone
thats not true
magnus it wasnt

shiftys punching his bedroom door yelling out
shiftys mum shuts the door as mr
she turns back into the hallway and suddenly begins to cry
shiftys dad walks in and holds her tight rez holds back not knowing what to do
five heavy looking bastards walk out of a house and towards a serious looking black range rover
one of them opens the boot and they throw in baseball bats a crowbar masking tape
chris sits on a wall the other side of the road a carrier bag full of beer
he sits drinking just staring at the house the music pumping from within
he watches as people arrive
he looks about
hes anxious upset he doesnt want to do this on his own
trevor unlocks the door and walks into the house his nose swollen face sullen guilty
we follow as he walks toward the front room where we see suit cases placed over the floor as jasmine busies herself packing
she doesnt look at trevor shes too angry with him
what are you doing babe
what does it look like
weve got another three days yet
ive got two kids to pack for
three including you
where are they
where do you think they are theyre in bed

jasmine walks past him still not looking him and into the kitchen where she takes wet washing from the machine
babe whats the matter
she walks back past him to the front room
when did you start using again
when did you start using cocaine again
what are you talking about

i tried to book a car and the card failed

she turns to look at him

the five heavies sit in the car heavy music playing out the motorway lights flashing past
babe people walk into scaffolding all the time

trevor drops his head

trevors starts crying
no dont you cry dont you dare fucking cry because to me thats even more repulsive
i want you to be a man for christs sake
i want you to be a fucking man about this trevor for once in your life take control of the fucking situation
shes at him screaming hitting
he just stands there limp absorbing her blows
jasmine walks away from him
trevors just left there pathetic alone
we jump cut as shifty cleans his cut puts on a fresh tee shirt freshens his face in the sink
shifty is then down in the kitchen at the washing machine
he pulls out the powder tray nothing there hes digging about inside he gets a torch hes trying to peer in frantic
where the fuck have you been
shiftys head darts
they stare at each other for a moment
rez im sorry man
where the fuck have you been
why didnt you phone mum and dad
rez walks into the kitchen
i ran out of juice
why didnt you use a pay phone
shifty doesnt answer
rez looks at the open tray on the washing machine
shifty look him in the eye
i need it rez where is it
where is it
where the fuck is it

the house that i pray in
he pushes shifty hard in the chest
rez rez man
i looked after you shifty i took you under my roof let you live in my house and this this is how you repay me
rez pushes shifty again hard
shifty grabs rez but rez punches him around the face they fall to the floor in a messy clinch rez pulling at shiftys face hitting him
rez rez rez
shifty manages to wrangle himself free
rez is up and at him
get out of my fucking house get out
rez rez i need that bag
rez if you dont give it to me im a dead man
rez storms off upstairs
shifty stands just rubbing his face with his hands muttering under his breath
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
he can hear rez rustling about upstairs
shifty starts ascending the stairs
shiftys enters the bathroom to see rez emptying the drugs into the toilet
rez flushes the chain
shifty pushes rez aside and reaches into the toilet but its too late
what the fuck have you done what the fuck have you done
get the fuck out
get the fuck out of my house
rez is pushing shifty again
shifty backs away down the steps
the motorway lights flicker through the glass illuminating the guys faces
one of them rotates a knife in his hand
shifty exits his brothers house
he stands there for a moment breathing hard thinking then heads off with conviction
jasmine still in a bit of a state her eyes reddened from tears sits sorting stuff out in the front room
she picks up the carrier bag that trevor brought home with him and looks inside she pulls out the camera and tapes
trevor sits at the garden table smoking a fag
jasmine walks outside
trevor looks up
i brought it for you
he walks past her back into the house and kisses her cheek she flinches slightly she stands there for a second soaking it in
chris sits on the wall he downs his beer straightens himself up and walks towards the house
a voice calls out
chris turns to see shifty approaching
they stand there for a moment
neither one saying anything
yeah im alright
chris looks down
look man im not gonna do this party
ive got too much shit to deal with
you dont have to come with me
its up to you
yeah cool ill probably just grab my stuff from yours then
shifty nods with acceptance but chris smiles
as if im not gonna come with you nutter
shifty shakes is head
fucking hell man
i thought you were gonna leave me cold
i thought you were used to it
theres only so much one man can take
they walk off
chris throws shifty a light punch
now you start throwing punches
quietly trevor sniffs up a corner of coke
he carefully opens the door to make sure jasmines not nearby
he exits and we follow him into the front room where jasmine sits with the camcorder
she aims it at trevor and presses record
jasmine peers into the lens
shifty and chris approach a rundown council flat
the door is shabby black bin liners decorate the floor
they stand for a moment when suddenly the door creaks open to reveal loretta peaking through
loretta is glen there
she watches them for a moment then shuts the door
shifty looks at chris
they stand for a moment when glen opens the door
i need to talk to you about something
glen just looks at him
can we do it inside
glen opens the door
they both walk into the flat
glen stops shifty and points for him to go into the bedroom
to chris mate ill only be a minute
chris walks into the front room where he sees lenny and loretta playing connect
he looks at lenny
lenny looks slowly up
chris perches himself on the edge of a dusty old armchair
he looks at loretta
you alright loretta
she smiles at him
you alright chris
he smiles nervously
whats going on what are you fucking doing here

something i dunno something serious
so i phoned magnus
talked to him about it
told him what happened
what losing all his gear
who told you that
and what did he say
that youve lost all his gear
all of his money
shifty pauses thinking
yeah well he went mental saying some other shit about me cutting it up mixing the coke he was saying all sorts of
glen stays quiet
shifty waits for a reaction
why would he be saying that
whos been talking to him
dunno mate youre guess is as good as mine
shifty pulls out his phone
perhaps you should phone him up now here in front of me tell him its all bollocks
glen just looks at shifty
you can tell him yourself
shifty holds the phone to glens face
go on mate call him up tell him that i dont cut up the coke
glen knocks down shiftys arm
i dont know what the fuck you do shifty
chris watches loretta and glen play connect
i know that you bowl around this town like its your fucking manor
with your smooth fucking paki chat
giving it the large
what are you talking about you prick
mugging off magnus saying that hes getting weak losing all his gear
what the fuck are you going about
and then you come to my house and you threaten me
shifty stays quiet
shooting off your fucking mouth telling me what youre gonna do to magnus
telling me how youre gonna take him down
shifty stares at glen seething
lenny and loretta having ditched the connect are chasing the dragon from a piece of tin foil
chris looks totally uneasy the situation is making him uncomfortable
youve been chopping up the fucking gear all along
selling half of it to the fucking turks cutting out magnus
glen looks a little shocked by shiftys revelation
who told you that
fuck you you cunt
youre just jealous cos you didnt think of it first
youre not that fucking smart
i didnt think of it cos im not that fucking stupid
theres a knock at the door
shifty hesitates then answers it
mate can we go

shifty goes to walk out with chris
glen follows them into the corridor
its about time you both fucked off
fuck off glen
after what happened
shifty and chris carry on walking out
no wonder you left mate
couldnt show your face after what you did
what did i do exactly
get the fuck out of my house
what the fuck did i do
mate just leave it the geezers a wanker
dont start shouting mate

suddenly with out hesitation chris grabs glen by his tee shirt and slams his forehead into glens nose
it breaks in a clean crack blood spurting out
glen doubles over holding his face
chris smashes his fist into the back of glens head glen goes down on his knees
chris is kicking him
shifty comes in and pulls him away laying in a few boots himself
glen stands up
you broke my fucking nose
youre a fucking dead man shifty
youre all ready a fucking dead man youre fucked
the black ranger rover soars along the motorway
shifty and chris cross a field trudging through the ankle length grass
they reach a hedge
shifty reaches into the bushes and starts rummaging around
he pulls out a black bin liner containing something heavy
he unwraps one bin liner to reveal another which has been tied with elastic
he undoes another black bin liner until finally hes left with just a leather sports bag
through the front windscreen we see a sign indicating a turnoff for dudlowe new town
the jeep veers making the exit just in time
chris and shifty make their way through the town
shiftys walking fast dictating the pace
where are we going
we should just go man get the fuck out of this shithole leave now go to manchester tonight im telling you
chris i cant
im not leaving
im not leaving my brother
they carry on walking together side by side
silhouetted by the night sky shifty and chris sit on dining chairs before the front window lights off waiting
the range rover creeps along the streets of dudlowe
does everyone think it was me
if they did youd be in prison mate
running off didnt help
i cant even remember giving it to her
we were all pretty fucked chris
she told me shed done pills before
chris if it wasnt you she would have got it from someone else mate
yeah but she didnt did she
shifty leans forward and opens the leather sports bag
he pulls out a
six shot revolver and a hand full of bullets
he starts loading the gun
chris stands up
jesus christ man what the fuck are you doing
shifty gestures for him to be quiet and points upstairs to his bother
fucking hell man this is bullshit
chris sit down man
chris sits down
shifty reaches in the bag and hands him a knuckle duster
chris looks at it
glad youre fucking sorted
the range rover pulls into a turning
they sit there just waiting
do you think theyll come
a moment of silence
wish id slept last night
hes feeling the pain
got any coke
weve been chased by the police
chris laughter increases
we got fucking mugged
theyre both starting to laugh
and my brother flushed my gear down the toilet
theyre both cracking up
party was blinding though werent it
theyre both laughing shifty motions for them to quieten down in case they wake rez
fuck the party
i never wanted to go anyway
the range rover turns off its lights
the guys just sit there waiting
chris is falling asleep head drooping
shiftys trying to stay awake one eye open struggling but hes too tired
both their heads are drooped theyre dead to the world
the range rover creeps along with its lights off
shifty jolts as if hes heard something going for the gun in his jacket
he looks around
the five heavies get out of the jeep
pulling on balaclavas bats knives guns at the ready
shifty and chris are silhouetted against the night sky
the five heavies approach the house
a shadow streaks across the front window but shifty and chris are asleep
the five heavies assemble outside the door
one of them kicks the front door with an almighty crash
shifty awakes with a jolt to see broad day light streaming in through the windows of the house
shifty steps out the front door to look about
its a nice day
he looks up and down the street nothing
he goes to walk back in the house when suddenly his eye catches something on the floor
he reaches down and picks up a large jiffy envelope thats been left leaning against the bin cupboard
scribed across the front is shifty shifty rips open the jiffy envelope
he pulls out a camcorder a polaroid falls to the floor face down
shifty looks at both
his face displays concern
shiftys packing fast
loading stuff into a sports bag tee shirts jeans socks
shifty pulls out a large bundle of money that hes been saving
shifty places an envelope on the table
rez scribed across the front
shifty walks into see chris sitting up on the sofa
he throws chris bag at him
he looks at his bag
at shiftys bag slung over his shoulder
shifty stands at the river side
chris beyond watching
shifty reaches into his jacket and pulls out the
he throws it into the river
give me your phone
give me your phone
he takes shiftys phone and chucks into the river
shifty and chris sit in silence
the bus pulls up
the bus pulls away
chris settles back and offers shifty one of his head phones to share
shifty takes it and sits back looking out the window
the track we heard at the beginning of the film begins to play noel mckoys brighter day
it plays softly over the following scenes
shifty stands staring at the camcorder in his hand and the polaroid face down on the floor
loretta awakes from a drug inflicted sleep and sits up
she looks around
shifty leans down to pick up the polaroid
loretta walks towards the bedroom she reaches for the handle
we see the same scene from the night before
but from a lower angle to see shifty holding his mobile phone by his side
who told you that
fuck you you cunt
youre just jealous cos you didnt think of it
youre not that fucking smart
i didnt think of it cos im not that fucking stupid
shifty turns over the polaroid
loretta opens the door to reveal glen taped to a chair and beaten to death
shifty turns over the polaroid to see a picture of glen taped to the chair and beaten to death
shifty opens the lcd on the camcorder and presses play and begins to watch
camcorder jasmine peers into the lens
she then turns the camera and follows trevor who plants himself on the other settee he looks uneasy
babe do me a favour
there is a colossal banging sound
what the fuc
trevors up on his feet
the banging becomes a crash as something gives way
three heavyset men in balaclavas charge into the front room
jasmine screams dropping the camera on its side yet still giving a viewpoint on events
three men are on trevor hes receiving a serious beating
a man grabs jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle of the room she attempts to fight back feisty as ever
this is bedlam
suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays a vicious right hook to trevors head
he goes down like a lead weight
jasmines crying fear washing over her
a child cries out from upstairs
tell that fucking slag to stop crying
two hooded men drag jasmine off to another room
shes fighting back clawing at them
trevors face is pressed against the cold lino flooring
someone has grabbed the camera and angles it on trevors bloodied features
congealed blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities
a hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face squeezing his cheeks so he looks sadly comic
trevors eyes flicker open
look into the lens
trevor fails to comply
the hand slaps him hard and grabs his face again
look into the fucking lens
say youre sorry
trevor begins to weep a painful sight
the voice echoes out
rez opens the envelope on the side and pulls out a mass of money left for him by shifty
loretta puts on her jacket and walks out of the flat
shifty sits looking out the window dudlowe passing him by as he exits the town
he nestles back into his chair and closes his eyes
he and chris seated next to one another
shoulder to shoulder
the music rises
