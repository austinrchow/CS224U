passengers arrive the paunchy graying men of first class leading the pack except for a handsome young republican poster boy hurrying along
welles gets up and follows

in front of an art deco hotel the driver opens the limousine door and the young republican steps out
welles watches from inside the double parked taxicab

welles sits alone at the bar eating a sandwich bored
he watches some fuzzy espn on the t

welles walks across the parking lot gets into his rental car starts it and drives away
young republican and a gaudy woman exit the disco music throbbing out from the doors behind them
they join hands drunk heading to the street looking for their limo
welles is seated in his parked rental car raises a camera with telephoto lens whir click whir click whir click
welles lowers the camera letting out a yawn
the familiar drone of flight
welles is shoehorned into his aisle seat using tiny utensils to eat his tiny meal
an older woman arrives in the aisle
welles picks up his tray closes his tray table unbuckling his seatbelt struggling to get up
finally successful balancing his tray letting the woman in to the window seat
welles nods forcing a smile sitting back down
he returns to toiling over his miniature supper
welles airplane roars down with a screech landing lights gleaming
the airport is small relatively isolated

welles leaves glances back shuts the door
welles drives his plain ford past the capital building
welles car crosses the susquehanna leaving the city
welles wears tan khakis t shirt and fishing cap mowing his lawn with his roaring lawnmower
welles yard is modest surrounding his modest split level suburban one in a neighborhood of similar homes and similar yards
welles turns the lawnmower stopping to mop his brow
one of his neighbors is repainting a back porch
the neighbor waves
welles waves resumes mowing
every lane full
welles is with his team in bowling shirts
welles hoists his ball preparing to bowl
he takes three steps releases
down the lane pins scatter
one pin remains standing
welles balls up his fists and curses walks back towards his rowdy mocking teammates
he shouts back at them laughing grabbing his beer and drinking waiting at the ball return
welles and amy eat at the kitchen table with cindy in a high chair
amy feeds cindy between bites
welles is still in his league shirt

welles nods eating
he watches amy feed cindy
the phone starts ringing
welles goes to answer it
into phone hello

welles hands the phone to amy pats cindys head as he heads downstairs through the living room
welles enters his well kept office turns on a light at the desk
the room is filled with file cabinets and shelves of books hundreds of phone books and a copy machine
welles picks up the phone and cups the receiver
shouts upstairs okay ive got it
into phone hello
sorry i was switching phones
its a pleasure to make your acquaintance mrs
yes i understand
tomorrow evening should be fine
welles listens clears space on his desk taking notes
a huge old world mansion is situated at the center of acres of pennsylvania forest and vast gardens
welles car heads down a long tree lined drive to the dark mansion
welles follows a butler down a long hall
the butler shows welles in shuts the door
towering shelves of books are serviced by ladders
far across the room an old sad woman mrs
christian sits waiting with a tall thin sinister ghoul of a lawyer
youre very prompt
i try to be
welles crosses towards them
it takes a while
i appreciate your coming on such short notice
christian holds out her hand and welles takes it
this is mister longdale my late husbands attorney
welles shakes longdales limp hand looking him over
uh huh pleasure
longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak
yes i do have something to say
i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs
christian contacted you
christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend
of what sort
you are a private investigator
well whatever reasons mrs
christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to
but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval
yes how theatrical
so youve gone on the record and now perhaps you should just be gone
longdales irritated but has no choice
he walks away
have a pleasant evening
to welles will you have tea mister welles
christian begins pouring tea from the service on a table
welles watches longdale exit
hes a lawyer
offers tea please sit here
welles accepts a dainty tea cup and saucer taking a seat
ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey
asking about you
i must say you have friends in influential places
ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire
you are highly recommended
praised for your discretion
your strict adherence to confidentiality
welles nods sipping tea
as you know my husband passed away recently
two weeks ago now
his passing has left me with
something of a dilemma
a terrible terrible dilemma
ill do whatever i can to help
christian studies welles
christian and welles enter
this office has been lived in for a lifetime
walls covered in old b w photographs and achievements
a large baked enamel sign nailed up his inner sanctum
welles looks up at the oil painting over the fireplace mr
christian a powerful old man posed with a dark teeming industrial landscape behind him
not many people have been inside this room
welles examines photos of mr
christian visiting various steel plants coal mines and ground breaking ceremonies shaking hands with workmen with politicians
thats where he started his empire building
looks up at portrait he was a good man
notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated
he wanted to be legendary
we were married forty five years
hard even for me to imagine
we had our troubles
there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him
i loved him deeply
do you carry a gun mr
i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to
other than that theres never any reason
christian crosses to take down a picture revealing a wall safe
the safe is ajar burnt and scarred broken into
my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe
i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business
not till now that is
you hired someone to open it
ill bet the lawyer loved that
there was nothing he could do
my husband left everything to me
looks at safe i prevented anyone from seeing the contents
i felt these were my husbands private things
i didnt realize
do you want to tell me what you found
cash stock certificates and this
she takes something from her pocket puts it on the desk a plastic bag containing a short mm film on a plastic reel
its a film
of a girl being murdered
im afraid i dont
this is a movie showing a girl being murdered
shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her
and he begins to cut her with a knife
pause i only watched what i could
welles picks up the film looks at it
i didnt know what to think
i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband
to know that he watched this
but i cant go to the police
please will you sit down a moment
leads her to a chair i want you to listen carefully
what youre talking about is a snuff film
but from what i know snuff films are a kind of
like red light district folklore
theres no such thing i can assure you
christian shakes her head
please believe me
this is probably a stag film
hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic
fake blood and special effects
if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away
youd see the tricks they can play
im telling you its not that
im sure it is
smiles its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke
more than likely he never even watched it
will you watch it and see for yourself
but im certain its nothing to worry about
an mm projector faces a wall
welles looks back to mrs
christian in the doorway
christian leaves shuts the door
welles turns on the projector and sits
the projector clatters shooting bright images
on the wall flash frames over exposure then
the grainy film is hand held constantly in motion showing a skinny girl or in a negligee sitting on a bed in a nondescript room with little furniture
looks like a hotel room
we only ever see three walls
the once beautiful girl looks worn drugged dark circles under her eyes staring blankly
the cameras tungsten spotlight casts long shifting shadows as the camera moves but the girl still stares oblivious
the bed is wrapped in plastic and duct tape
the floor is covered by plastic sheeting
welles watches crossing his arms already uncomfortable
on the wall a door opens behind the girl looks like a bathroom and a masked man enters
the masked man wears a garish mexican wrestling mask with eye holes and a mouth
the mask covers his entire head
hes naked except for red shorts his body scrawny oiled pale
the man goes to stand in front of the girl
he seems to be saying something to her but the film is silent and the only sound is the projectors loud sprocket hole clatter
its all one long take
the camera moves to favor the girl
welles sits straight in his chair wary
on the wall masked man raises his open hand and slaps the girl knocking her back on the bed
on the wall masked man pulls the girl back to a seated position
the girls like a rag doll face reddened eyes closed but she remains upright
masked man uses his thumbs to open her unseeing eyes
he touches her mouth with his fingers presses his lips to hers
then masked man backs away leaving frame till the camera moves to find masked man standing at a table with three large bowie knifes laid out
masked man runs his fingers over the blades
welles rises slowly still watching
on the wall masked man selects a huge bowie knife and moves back towards the girl
welles crosses his arms tight disbelieving fearful
but welles does
in the flickering reflected light welles backs involuntarily away from the horrible images holding his fist to his mouth breathing hard
welles keeps backing away till hes backed against a wall
the projectors clattering
welles is sickened sweating still watching till he finally shuts his eyes
christian sits waiting troubled
the door to the dining room opens and welles enters from the dark visibly shaken
christian watches him her sorrow now shared
you need to go to the police
i told you i cant not yet
you dont have any other choice
stands shakes her head no
for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished
if you can find them i will take their names to the police
ill say my husband confessed on his death bed
ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first
it wont work like that
any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously
ive thought about it and theres no other way
if you cant find them
if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen
im telling you i wont
if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her
welles sits rests his head in his hands
i deal in divorce cases
youve found missing persons before
nothing remotely like this
i know what im asking
your compensation will be appropriate to the risk
youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it
pause i feel responsible mr
pause you saw what he did to her
welles stands torn apart and uncertain looks back to the dining room where the projector sits idle
cindy is sound asleep in her crib
welles is seated near staring at his sleeping child
welles digs in piles of shoeboxes and books on the floor of his cluttered closet finds what he wants a lock box
welles twists the lock box dials combination opens the box to reveal his gun holster and cleaning supplies
welles takes out the gun cleaning it
this is the mortgage
this is cindys college money
sometimes you cant know what im doing
its better that way
its a missing persons case
a long shot
ill give it two months two months at most then ill be back
well take a vacation
why the gun
im not gonna need it
i wont even wear it
its a precaution
cleaning gun dont worry about me
welles looks through one file cabinet
he pulls out a file
it contains all sorts of police artist sketches
welles finds one of a teenage girl with dark hair looks at it
welles positions the sketch on his copy machine hits copy
welles loads boxes and a suitcase into his cars back seat
welles puts the lock box in the cars trunk in a hiding place beside the spare tire
he places a brown briefcase on top covers them both with carpet
he closes the trunk
welles ford races down the highway
city skyline overcast
looks like rain
cleveland ohio welles car moves slowly in a not so great neighborhood
welles leans forward peering through the windshield
an apartment buildings crooked sign lists dingy room
welles locks the door puts the chain on
his suitcase and boxes are on the bed
he begins unpacking taking a photo enlarger from one box and an mm projector
the developers on the toilet
developing pans are on the floor developer bath stop bath and fixing bath with bottles of chemicals and packages of photo paper
welles uses tape and aluminum foil to black out a window
pizza box on the bedside table
welles suits hang in the closet
welles sits facing a small reel to reel on a desk
he wears white gloves handles the mm film careful to hold it by the edges holding it up to the light squinting
welles puts in a magnifying eyepiece leaning close
through magnifying lens studying the first few inches of exposed film coming upon tiny letters printed just below the sprocket holes supralux
red bulb in the light socket
welles threads the mm film into his enlarger still in white gloves
he flicks the enlarger on projecting a sideways image down onto the enlargers baseboard focusing
its the girl sitting on the bed early in the snuff film
welles makes an adjustment to the enlargers lens framing tighter on the girls face refocusing
welles comes out of the makeshift darkroom holding a photo of the girl
he props the photo up on a dresser stands looking at it
sad girl staring forward
welles goes to pick up his cellular phone dials
into phone hello honey its me
listens im fine how are you
he turns to look at the girls photo
resource center for missing persons
employees work phones and computers
bulletin boards are covered in family photos polaroids and familiar have you seen me
missing person children posters
in one cubicle welles opens his billfold shows his identification a laminated commonwealth of pennsylvania with welles photo
the director of the center a tired looking official in bifocals studies the card
what can i do for you mr
call me tom
what id like very simply is access to your archive
and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private citizens
there are reasons for the way we do things here
of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out
the director sits back in his chair
few days ago i was contacted by a couple living in philadelphia a doctor and his wife
what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe
they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city
nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that
at the very least she should pick up a telephone
not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself
snaps fingers thats the last they saw her
the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch
shows the police artist sketch he photocopied they want to see if i can i
this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright
why not go to the n
or i figured you share information
for whatever reasons i thought you might be more receptive
why dont they come to me
this doctor and wife theyre nice people but they dont want to get too involved
theyre not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either
you and i both know sometimes not often but sometimes theres real reasons why a kidll run
besides that the girls probably eighteen so shes legal
im not so sure about this
theyre putting themselves in place of this kids parents and thinking theyd want to hear their girls okay even if thats all they hear
i can give you my card if your clients want to call me
welles accepts a card disappointed
they were pretty clear they didnt want this coming back on them
well thats all i can do
welles looks at the director stands hangs his head
maybe shes already given her parents a call right
welles comes out the front doors pissed
he tears the card in half and drops it as he heads for his car
after a moment the director comes out after him
tom hold on
welles looks back walks back glances down
makes sure he stands on the torn card hiding it underfoot
listen maybe i can help after all
why dont you come on back in
well see what we can do
director leads welles into this research room a small library with long tables old computers lots of file cabinets and card catalogs
secretaries tend to the files
this is it
its not much
points at computers weve got less than five percent on computer and we lose that funding in december
ill have someone show it to you anyway
other than that im afraid its the wet thumb method
welles looks to the many many file drawers
files are mostly by state and year of disappearance
we try to keep the children and adults separate
no eating or smoking in here but theres a coffee machine in the hall
its horrible but itll be your best friend after a few days
i hope you realize what kind of long shot youre chasing after
youre gonna be seeing a lot of me
youre sure you dont mind
its good what youre doing
the director puts out his hand
welles looks shakes
on a computer screen files open and close picture after picture of a missing children mostly teenagers each with physical description age date of disappearance etc
lost souls although these are posed portraits high school yearbook photos and vacation photos so the children are mostly smiling happy and healthy
but all welles works the computer keyboard and mouse
on the screen the faces of teenagers boys and girls one after the other missing
welles searches the shelves of the library
he begins taking down various books
motion picture photography
film stocks and physical characteristics
in welles notepad supralux
welles sits paging through technical photography books
welles has the mm film threaded through the projector
he turns the clattering projector on and sits watching
on the wall flash frames then
the skinny girl in a negligee sitting on the bed
the cameras spotlight casts long shadows
the girl stares oblivious
on the wall a door opens behind the girl looks like a bathroom and the masked man enters wearing the ghastly wrestling mask
the man goes to stand in front of the girl
he seems to be saying something
the film halts
welles sits forward hand on the projector
hes seen something
he plays the film in reverse
on the wall the masked man walks backwards away from the girl backwards into the bathroom door shutting
welles stops the projector not taking his eyes from the image
he advances the film frame by frame
frame by frame
as the bathroom door opens and the masked man enters
frame by frame
as the masked man moves forward
door closing behind him
freeze frame a third man is reflected in the bathroom mirror
grainy and blurred but hes in the room with the girl standing there captured in the mirror in this one brief instant just before the bathroom door closes
welles walks to take a closer look studying the almost ethereal image of the third man
welles is in a phone booth feeds many quarters into the phone waiting looking at his notepad
into phone hello mrs
heres where we stand
i checked the film stock and its called supra lux
the company that made that stock discontinued it in
listens yeah about five or six years ago
anyway do what you can to dig up your husbands old financial records look for anything out of the ordinary
welles is back at the computer alone drinking coffee
on the computer endless photos of missing children
the phone call continues in voice over welles v
cont nobody really uses eight millimeter film anymore so we can assume there are reasons our guys did
first they could develop it themselves if they had any sort of expertise
obviously this isnt the kind of movie you can just drop off at the one hour photo
welles just stands staring at the photo of the girl
cont second the film that went through the camera is what weve got
theres no negative
unlike video it wasnt meant to be duplicated
no reason for them to risk having more than one copy of their murder floating around
welles sits drinking with the archives director talking smiling at something the director said
cont there dont seen to be many fingerprints on the film itself but im going to have to be careful to leave them intact
welles is tired unshaven
hes moved on to the physical files at one table looking through hundreds of missing person bulletins
secretaries tend to other files
cont its okay for yours and your husbands fingerprints to be on the film but youll have to use me as a middleman if you go to the police
that way i dont have to explain why my prints are on it
welles sits with the projector on watching the film again
cont there were three men
two are obvious the man in the mask and the man running the camera but i caught a glimpse of a third man in a mirror
its nothing that can be used for identification but he was there watching
on the wall masked man touches the girls mouth presses his lips to hers
masked man backs away leaving frame till the camera moves to find masked man standing at a table with three large bowie knifes laid out
welles notices something puts the projector on freeze frame
cont so there were three
they would have kept it small wouldnt have let anyone in on it they didnt have to
thats all for now
except i feel i should tell you
with this looking like it happened at least five or six years ago
welles walks to the frozen image on the wall
it shows the masked mans hands in frame fingering the blades
cont well its not very likely well ever find out who this girl was
listens i will ill keep trying
phone call ends with the sound of the phone hanging up
on the wall theres a dark spot on masked mans hand on the arch between his index finger and thumb
grainy and hard to make out but looks like a small tattoo
welles has the mm film threaded into his photo enlarger projecting the image we just saw down onto the baseboard
he re frames closer on the masked mans hand refocusing
the black spot is a little clearer looks like a small star tattoo on the back of masked mans hand
welles sits hunched over the card catalog still unshaven drinking coffee flipping through smaller pictures of missing children in one drawer one by one by one
welles rolls his neck
he looks to see the archives director in the doorway
the director nods leaving
welles gets back to it stooped over the catalog
three weeks later in the lot welles gets wearily from his car smoking
he tosses the cigarette gets a thermos off the front seat
welles pulls out a card catalog drawer labeled north carolina flipping through picture cards
the faces of teenagers a happy boy with blue eyes
a red headed girl with freckles
a ruddy faced boy
a pretty girl with a ribbon in her hair
a black girl in a pink dress
a blonde haired boy with curly hair
welles furrows his brow
he backtracks to the pretty girl with the ribbon in her hair
welles sits straight
he reaches into his pocket hands shaking a little takes out and unfolds the photo he printed of the girl from the snuff film
welles compares the two pictures
shes prettier in the card catalog photo but its her
welles cant believe it looks around
secretaries at other files dont even know hes there
welles pulls out his notepad scribbling down information off the card
writing the girls name mary anne matthews
welles car races past alone on the dark freeway
another small city
blue skies above
fayetteville north carolina suburban library
kids play hop scotch in the parking lot
welles works the microfiche machine scrolling through old issues of the local newspaper finds an article headlined search continues for local teen
theres a picture of the girl mary anne mathews the same picture welles found in the missing person archive
welles reads the article writing on a legal pad
newsprint scrolls past on the microfiche machine till
no leads in girls disappearance
the date at the top july
newsprint blurs past
stops on a page of top of the page september
mathews robert steven
dead in an apparent suicide robert mathews was discovered yesterday morning in the basement of
a tree lined street of poor boxy homes
welles car parks in front of one house with a neglected lawn
welles clean shaven picks a clipboard with a file folder and his legal pad on it thumbs pages
he drums his fingers opens the glove compartment pulls out the cars registration other papers and jiffy lube service reports uses them to pad the file
welles takes a bottle of cologne from his pocket
he considers it opens the bottle applies cologne to his neck
welles knocks clipboard in hand
a sad middle aged woman answers mrs
mathews looking through the screen door
smiles hello mrs
mathews my names thomas jones im a state licensed investigator
welles holds up his identification only long enough for mrs
mathews to see it looks official
ive been hired as an independent contractor by the u
resource center for missing persons as part of an internal audit
if you have any time over the next few days id like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter
i dont understand who are
im sorry let me explain the r
is a support organization and archive not unlike the center for missing and exploited children in washington
im sure youve dealt with them before
these volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected functioning hand in hand with law enforcement
brought me in to review their investigations
holds up clipboard fact check their records see if theres anything they missed anything they should be doing different
im here for a few days before i head back up to virginia
these reports go to the justice department eventually
i spoke to your f
contact a few days ago uh
welles pretends to look for the name on a jiffy lube page
what was the name
ive got it here somewhere
pretends he found it right agent cole told me hed call and let you know to expect me
he didnt call
looking on legal pad well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair
missing june th
a runaway thats how shes listed
is this information correct
mathews stares nods
im sorry i know this isnt easy
is there a more convenient time
looks at watch can i buy you lunch would that be alright
mathews looks him up and down
welles and mrs
mathews eat at a picnic table on the patio
its very important you dont let this raise your expectations
its not going to effect any ongoing efforts
all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope
they hired you
youre like a private detective
thats exactly what i am
mathews chews staring off into the distance
i didnt think there were private detectives anymore except on tv
you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat
drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses
want to know what its really like
its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on
and the guy who hired you he has a hair lip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes
cheating and you dont blame her
its refreshing to actually sit down and meet someone face to face someone nice like you
mathews takes out a cigarette
welles lights her joins her in smoking refers to his clipboard
so she didnt leave a note
she never gave any indication where she might go before she left
she just seemed
she didnt seem herself
for months there never was any way to get her to talk about it
one night we went to bed
the next morning she was gone
she took some clothes
what was she running from
i dont know
if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask
he committed suicide
about a year after mary disappeared
we were divorced by then
things fell apart
he was living with a friend
why do you think he did it
it got to be too much for him
you have to forgive me but in these circumstances
with your daughter
pause were there any indications of
any sort of abuse
there wasnt anything like that
the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never
his heart broke when mary left
i didnt mean to
you try going through what we did
bob couldnt take it thats all
christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either
i had to ask
no one knows what its like
you cant even imagine how much it hurts
welles is miserable
a few customers walk past looking at mrs
she tries not to notice then noticing
people remember me from the news
pause can you drive me back now
this was the girls room exactly as she left it posters of actors on the wall many stuffed animals on the pink sheets of the carefully made bed
this is her room
welles looks around uncomfortable
shelves have pictures of mary with female friends a collection of ceramic figurines of clowns and animals
the police made a wreck of it but i put it back exactly how it was
just how she likes it
welles takes a few steps into the room looks down at a desk where there are six brightly wrapped gifts
those are for her birthday
one for every year shes missed
theyll be waiting for her when she comes back
welles is nearly overwhelmed by sadness struggling to hide it
he backs to the door looks at his watch
i shouldnt take anymore of your time
maybe we can finish tomorrow
ill call tomorrow
welles escapes to his car climbing in
he starts it up
welles drives tears welling up in his eyes
he has to pull over and park wiping his tears fighting for composure
welles has unpacked
hes on the bed on his cellular
into phone you should be able to take a shower and still have hot water left honey
listens call him back and tell him i said so
the goddamn things still under warranty
listens im okay
its hard here
listens ive got a lead i have to follow through
to be honest i dont think im going to get very far
i miss you
i love you
welles sits at the kitchen table
mathews makes coffee
the homes decor is cheap and flowery
we werent religious
we never forced religion down her throat like ive seen some parents do to their kids
we never made her go to church
but after mary was gone thats when i got religious
mathews brings two cups of coffee sits
doesnt make much sense does it
when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother
then something horrible happens
thats when you start praying all the time
thats when you start going to church
were all like that
are you religious
you should be
mathews drinks coffee stares into the cup
ive got what i need for my report
there is one thing that bothers me though
its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either
see i know a little about missing persons
when kids run they almost always leave a note
they want to say goodbye
there wasnt one
the police looked
do you think the police did a good job
i dont know
i think so
it is possible
and i know this isnt something you want to hear
your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it
she might have wanted to tell you something
you dont have any reason to think that
if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place
mathews is getting upset
how can you say that to me
will you let me look
my husband never laid a hand on her
she would have told me
she would have told me
youre probably right and i probably wont find anything
i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of
me that cant let it go
police are just as human as you or i
they could have missed something
they probably didnt
pause wouldnt you rather know
mathews thinks about it tortured shakes her head sadly
go ahead and look if you want
i dont care what you do
mathews gets up and walks out of the room
mathews bedroom welles looks through dresser drawers methodically replacing everything as it was
searches hat boxes and shoe boxes in a closet
takes books off shelves fanning the pages shaking them out
in a bathroom welles examines the contents of a medicine cabinet examining old prescription bottles
opens cabinets under the sink
in the living room mrs
mathews sits slumped in a chair staring at a soap opera on television a bottle of scotch on tv tray beside her drink in hand
in the kitchen welles stands on a chair searches high cabinets
looks through low cabinets on his knees pulls out pots and pans
fans the pages of cook books
welles stands in the doorway of marys room just stares
he takes a few steps back into the hallway looks up at the ceiling
theres an attic door there
welles reaches to the doors handle opens it unfolds the portable stairs
in the small attic welles uses a penlight flashlight crouched under the low ceiling looking through dusty boxes of photographs old photos of a wedding of grandparents
welles moves to pull back dusty sheets finds a large wicker basket and broken bicycle underneath
welles opens the basket takes out blankets and quilts in mothballs
he finds a wide velvet box takes it out opens its hinged lid to reveal a set of good silverware
he touches the tarnished silverware lifts out the top tray
underneath resting on top of more silverware is a diary
welles opens the diary finds written mary anne mathews
welles turns pages
the diarys about half full of feminine cursive handwriting
after the last written page a page has been torn out
welles fingers the ragged edge flips through the blank pages till he comes to the very last page a goodbye note
welles sits and reads
emotionless monotone dear mom
if youre reading this it means i called you from hollywood california and told you where to find my diary
i dont think ill be able to tell you this when i talk to you so im writing it down here
you know i havent been happy for a long long time
for a long time now dads been doing things i couldnt tell you
hes been touching me and its getting worse
i cant stay anymore
i know you and i havent always gotten along sometimes but please dont blame yourself
there isnt anything you can do
im going to make a whole new life in california
maybe someday youll see me on tv or in magazines
dont worry about me
love mary anne
welles shuts the attic door takes the diary from his pocket hides it in his waistband at the small of his back
mathews looks up from the tv
you were right
pause i didnt find anything
im going to run and get something to eat
are you hungry
welles uses a self serve copy machine flattening the diary on the glass photocopying the diary as quickly as he can
welles sits picking at fast food in front of him
mathews food isnt even unwrapped
shes numb from her drink watching a game show smoking
do you ever consider
do you realize that mary may never come back
mathews looks to welles looks back at the tv
i think about it everyday
but every time the phone rings
every single time i still think its her
its been six years
what am i supposed to do
time heals all wounds right
misery building shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that
but you want the truth
the real truth
if i had a choice
if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her
pause or her being dead and me knowing
pause id choose to know
mathews stares into the tv wipes tears
welles takes a deep breath and holds it
he watches her a long moment motionless
finally he stands voice unsteady
excuse me i have to use your bathroom
welles comes to the attic door quietly pulls it open
welles uses his penlight digs out the diary from the hiding place in his waistband replaces it in the box of silverware closes the box
welles enters takes a picture frame off one shelf opens the back and takes out the photo of mary from inside
mathews still gazes into the tv
welles passes the doorway not looking in heading to the front door opening the door and walking out
mathews doesnt even notice doesnt look up
welles crosses the front lawn not looking back heading to the street getting into his car starting his car doing a u turn driving away down the street
welles boxes of belongings are piled in the back seat of his car
welles covers them with a blanket shuts the door
welles opens the trunk of his car pulls back the carpeting
he opens the brown briefcase
the briefcase is full of cash about twenties and fifties in bundles
welles transfers half the money into a carry on bag shuts the briefcase covers it closes the trunk
the cabins half full dark
under the only illuminated reading light welles reads the photocopied diary
marys voice is a again a flat monotone
as welles reads dear diary
i have a big math test tomorrow
i have to get better grades
how come everybody does better than me
kathy doesnt even study and she gets bs
two boys got in a fight after school today
one boy knocked the other boys tooth out at least thats what it looked like
his nose and mouth were bleeding all over the place
an airplane roars downwards heading in for a landing
an ugly city
hollywood sign on the smoggy horizon
a cheap stucco hotel in a wounded hollywood neighborhood
welles suitcase is open on the bed
welles sits in a chair with his feet up sweating in the heat reading the diary
as welles reads
were reading the great gatsby in english class
its the story of this guy who has lots of fancy parties and all his friends come around and party with him but later when he dies nobody comes to
someone said theres a movie about it but i looked in the video store and it wasnt there
welles flips pages further back in the diary
as welles reads dear diary
i started my first job last week working part time at price mart department store
welles and a bank employee both put keys into a safe deposit box unlocking it and sliding out the metal drawer
the people i work with are all old and fat
all they live for is their next coffee break so they can smoke
welles is alone opens the empty safe deposit drawer takes the mm film from his pocket and puts it in the drawer
they eat lunch at the snack counter
hot dogs and soft pretzels
nachos with that orange cheese that comes out of a pump
i dont know what id do if im still working there when i get old
a large neon cross identifies this hostel in mid hollywood
i want to be a singer or an actress
i know its a stupid dream but i know i can do it if i get a chance
welles talks to the man behind the counter shows the picture of mary taken from mrs
everyones always telling me how pretty i am
i dont think i am
when i look in the mirror i wonder who theyre talking about
the man behind the counter shakes his head
a run down shelter
welles shows the picture of mary to the proprietor explaining
the proprietor shakes his head
cont dear diary
i went out with bob today the cute boy in my science class
he took me to a movie
welles continues his trek standing in the dank hallway of a ywca dormitory showing the picture to a counselor
it was the middle of the day but we held hands
i think he likes me
i really like him
he has black hair and grey eyes
welles sits in his rental car in a massive traffic jam
he opened the car door for me and paid for the movie
when he took me home he said we should go out again soon
i hope he calls
welles drives looking out the windshield
at decaying peep shows an adult bookshop and sex shop
cont dear diary
janet says she slept with her boyfriend
i cant believe it
she says they did it last weekend while her parents were out of town
welles drives watching overweight prostitutes and tall muscular transvestites prowling the sidewalks in mini skirts and stained tight spandex pants
she said she liked it but she didnt seem too happy
she didnt tell me many details
she said he used a condom
teenaged male prostitutes hang out in front of a pizza parlor
a few have their shirts off crewcut and muscular
cont dear diary
if i save enough money to go to community college maybe i can get good enough grades for a scholarship somewhere else
a tribe of homeless teenagers sits on the sidewalk in front of souvenir shops
they beg money off pedestrians
ive never been anywhere else
i dont think mom wants to let me go
every time i try to talk about it she says itll cost too much or she changes the subject
a long line of homeless persons trails out the door
welles stands out front showing the picture to a volunteer with a broom and a priest
cont dear diary
something terrible happened today when dad and i were alone
i cant tell anyone
i feel sick
what did i ever do to make this happen to me
the volunteer and priest cant help
welles is weary futility beginning to wear on him walks to his car
cont dear diary
my stomach hurts all the time
i just want to go to sleep and never wake up
i want to get out of my head and stop hearing myself think
welles smokes driving blankly watching the road ahead
cont dear diary
grandma fell and broke her leg last week
we drove down to visit her in the hospital
hospitals smell like dead people
follow welles car speeding along
cont dear diary
its happening all the time now
there s nothing i can do
im all alone
everything is bad
i used to have lots of dreams and id remember them when i woke up but that doesnt happen anymore
pull back still following welles car over the freeway
cont dear diary
if i can get to california ill be okay
ive got money saved
i can work as a waitress till i get something better
billy says he and his family went to california once on vacation
he says it never rains
they stayed near the beach and he went swimming in the ocean
continue to pull back till welles car is very very far below revealing the staggering size of the city of los angeles where the lights go on forever and forever
welles is seated elbows on his knees reading the diary
i hope i can be an actress
i hope i can be happy
ill probably have to go to acting school
i wish i knew someone who lived there
ill miss my friends but at least ill be far away where no one can ever find me
welles has come to the end of the writing in the diary
the next photocopied page shows an image of the torn ragged edge of the diarys missing page
welles enters this adult video storefront
the clerk is a sleazy forty year old man with rings in his pierced nose and lips behind a counter by the door
he watches welles pass
welles looks around uncomfortable
a few of the other customers all men sneak glances at welles
display shelves run floor to ceiling full of hundreds of shrink wrapped xxx porno tapes
welles pretends to browse
handmade signs above each section identify content anal big tits cumshots bondage and fetish etc
welles looks back at the clerk who stares at welles
welles feels obligated to pick up a box and act like hes considering it
he glances at other customers
each man keeps his eyes forward on the pornography
one guy has his arms full of about ten videos
welles puts the tape back walks to the front counter
the clerk watches him the whole time
is this pretty much it
the clerk just stares at welles
what are you looking for
welles considers decides to leave exiting
welles comes in through the blacked out door
this place is larger than the last
two clerks are behind the counter
one clerks pricing porn the other max reads a porno novel
max has long hair colorful tattoos covering his forearms has a highlighter marker in his mouth
theres a huge video bargain bin
walls are covered in videos sex toys inflatable women etc
customers again all wary males follow proper porn shop etiquette look at the porn not your fellow shopper
there are peep show booths in the back
a man looks around trying to be nonchalant sweating profusely slipping behind one curtain
welles pretends to read the packaging on a triple pack of dildos looks towards the front
behind the register max takes a look to make sure the other clerk is busy takes the cap of his highlighter pen and highlights a section in the book hes
welles notes this
he goes to the substantial magazine rack picks up a porn tabloid pages through it
he selects sex magazines and newspapers choosing about twenty five
welles takes this pile up to max gets out his wallet
max starts ringing everything up

my boss tells me i have to do more suggestive selling
well its tempting but no thanks
its your call but youre gonna be sorry when youre in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery operated vagina and you dont have one
ill risk it
max shoves everything into a bag and hands it over
thank you for shopping at adult bookstore

welles takes the bag
max returns to his book
welles is leaving but stops at the end of the counter
what are you reading
max holds up the book anal secretary
once you pick it up you cant put it down
what are you really reading
off maxs look hard to believe that books got any parts worth highlighting
max takes a glance at the other clerk opens the pages of the book and shows it to welles
music for chameleons
i tear off the cover and paste this one on
nods towards clerk you know how it is
wouldnt want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts
smiles shrugs might get drummed out of the pornographers union and then where would i be
another customer clears his throat waiting at the register
max turns to help him
welles heads out
welles is at a table porn publications spread out before him looking through the back of a porno tabloid
turning pages of hardcore advertisements adults only she male films amateur sex videos women and animals youve got to see it to believe it
welles moves on to the next magazine turning to the back again page after page watersports and fisting specialists s of anal films asian sex
hundreds of ads with naked women urging callers to pick up the phone
hundreds of amateur photos of naked men and women with faces and genitalia blacked over
men seeking women women seeking women men seeking men transvestites
it is endless
more sex slaves wanted underground films s m and bondage fetish videos
welles leaves it overwhelmed goes to lay down on the bed
he picks up his cellular phone dialing
into phone hi honey how are you
listens the way its going im about ready to pack my bags
in a dark room we dont know where a dark figure of a man is silhouetted
he wears headphones listening through headphones ive got a feeling the person im looking for came out here and got swallowed up by the place
through headphone come back now

welles shuts his eyes still on the cellular
into phone i miss you too

max comes out from the porn shop walks to welles looking around

welles walks away
welles sleeps despite the stead sound of traffic racing by his window
the phone rings waking him
welles looks at the clock radio am reaches to answer the phone
into phone hello
from phone wake up pops
your education begins tonight
against the backdrop of downtown las bright skyscrapers welles rental car heads into the lower bowels of the city smaller older darker buildings
the only people on the street are homeless and shady characters
welles car makes its way to a big deserted parking lot
there are a few cars parked in one corner
welles parks near the other cars and gets out
max stands against a chain link fence
welles goes to meet him
max leads the way across the lot towards dark alleyways
max and welles move through this filth strewn alley between decaying brink buildings
they cone to a stairwell leading down to pitch dark
max enters through a crooked door heads into a narrow labyrinth hallway lit by bare bulbs
they come to another stairway leading down
at the bottom a thick necked goon stands guarding double doors
are you a law enforcement agent or in any way affiliated with law enforcement
fuck you larry
max heads to the double doors waits for welles
to welles are you a law enforcement
max and welles enter through the double doors into a kind of small underground porn flea market
its incredibly quiet
about fifteen card tables are set up in rows
the men behind the tables and the thirty or so customers looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society
these are middle aged men most balding some with pot bellies in shorts and tube socks in sweatpants and members only jackets plain men but with a look of desperation
in their eyes glancing around nervously greasy and afraid
were shutting down in fifteen minutes
welles makes his way to the tables wary
one table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes filled with hundreds of photos of young children mostly boys naked
each photo is wrapped in plastic censored by masking tape
welles swallows back disgust
the next table is piled high with used pornographic magazines
there are baggies with colorful pills laid out
x rated polaroids wrapped in rubberbands
max follows behind unaffected smokes a cigarette
another table offers video tapes with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out two sixteen five
and many bootleg videos with grainy homemade labels showing women in extreme bondage
welles watches out the corner of his eye as the plump man beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures
welles waits till the man moves on addresses the angry looking dealer whos counting money
points to numbered videos what are these
mixed hard bondage
buy five get one free
welles looks around wipes sweat off his top lip
theres nothing harder
what you see is what i got mister
you know where i can get it
i have a lot of money to spend
there aint no such thing as snuff
why dont you fuck off
the dealer sits and keeps counting cash
welles moves on beyond the tables theres a curtained doorway
welles walks to it enters
folding chairs face a screen
a projector shows a silent movie a buxom woman in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube
a hairy overweight man lays face down on an examination table naked arms tied behind his back
in the darkness a man shifts in his chair grunting obviously masturbating
a few chairs away a man is bent over moving his head in the lap of someone in a blonde wig
a large man approaches welles from the dark
you have to pay to come in here
welles backs away shuts the curtain
not many people in the place
welles drinks coffee
max eats a huge breakfast
youve got penthouse playboy hustler etc
nobody even considers them pornography anymore
then theres mainstream hardcore
the difference is penetration
that whole industrys up in the valley
writers directors porn stars
theyre celebrities or they think they are
they pump out videos a week
a week theyve even got a porno academy awards
america loves pornography
anybody tells you they never use pornography theyre lying
somebodys buying those videos
somebodys out there spending million dollars a year on phone sex
know what else
its only gonna get worse
more and more youll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream because thats evolution
oh my god elvis presleys wiggling his hips how offensive
nowadays mtvs showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out
know what i mean
for the porn addict big tits arent big enough after a while
they have to be the biggest tits ever
some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head literally
soon playboy is gonna be penthouse penthousell be hustler hustlerll be hardcore and hardcore filmsll be medical films
peoplell be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds
theres nowhere else for it to go
what you saw tonight were not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend
were talking about stuff where people get hurt
theres two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal
foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites
its beyond hardcore but legal
this is the kind of hardcore where one guys going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love
now with some of the s m and bondage films they straddle the line
how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not
step over that line youre into kiddie porn
rape films but there arent many
ive never seen one
i heard you asking
that guy wasnt yanking you around
theres no such thing
what other ways are there to get illegal films
who do you see
first of all basement sales like tonight arent gonna last much longer
its too risky one and two everythings going on the internet
anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants
its heaven for those degenerate chicken hawks
theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em
but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes
no one knows where it comes from
thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth
those are zombies hardcore junkies
their hands are permanently pruned
they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister
other than that all i know about is the mail
classified ads in the paper with hidden codes
credit card orders to dummy corporations
interstate wire transfers
but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit
thats the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal
theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is
welles watches max eat
how old are you
where are your parents
i dont know where are yours
i dont mean any offense
but what are you doing mixed up in all this
im not mixed up in anything hayseed
what are you talking about
you just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else
yeah im a real genius
what choices have i got
fuck just because i know about stuff like tonight doesnt mean i deal it
i work a job
it beats pumping gas beats making hamburgers
youre telling me it doesnt get to you
you cant sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb
am i gonna go off and be a race car driver
go to harvard
run for president
what about you pops
what about me
i see a ring on your finger
you have any kids
so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania
what are you doing mixed up in all this
max and welles comes out to the sidewalk talking
inside a parked car through the windshield someone watches max and welles say goodnight
max walks to a waiting taxi
its the sinister lawyer watching longdale the late mr
christians attorney watching welles go to his rental car
welles is seated projector running watching the mm film
the last of the film makes its way through threading out
the take up reel spins the films tail flapping
welles stares at the blank white square of light projected onto the wall
cellular phone is heard ringing
welles finally looks to the projector turns it off
the phones ringing
welles goes to sit on the bed looking at the cellular phone on the bedside table
welles lets it ring
till it finally stops
welles lays back on the bed and shuts his eyes
christian is behind the desk surrounded by boxes of bank records and financial statements on the phone
into phone my husband had five cash accounts he used to temporarily hold stock profits
between november of and march of he wrote one check out to cash from each account
he wrote these himself
welles is in the booth listening
into phone okay
from phone my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash
im not positive this means anything
the checks were for odd amounts
christian has the amounts written out on paper
into phone one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents
another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents
from phone okay i follow you so far
totalled together these five checks from five different accounts they equal one million dollars
into phone youre joking
from phone to the penny
exactly one million dollars in cash
welles considers this lost in thought
do you think the film could have cost that much
for a human life
murder on film no statute of limitations
it sure could have
id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box
send it to me through the post office like we arranged
no return address
you dug this up all by yourself
you told me to look so i looked
youre one hell of a detective mrs
teenagers work cleaning this large dormitory sweeping and mopping the floor making the bunk beds washing windows
welles stands with an elderly black nun in plain clothing
her name was mary anne mathews
welles hands the woman the picture of mary
the woman puts on her glasses looks at the picture
looks at welles
i remember mary you
please sister will you take another look make sure
examines picture yes
i remember her
in a basement corner welles watches as the nun uses keys to open the door of a chain link storage cage
the cage is full of junk boxes lamps stacks of chairs
she lived here for only about a month if i recall correctly
she didnt return one night
she never came back
i didnt know what to think
the nun enters the cage pushes old boxes out of her way looks up a cob web covered metal shelves
do you know what happened to her
im trying to find out
she was a runaway
im looking into it for her parents
the nun sees what she wants finds a step ladder tries to open it
welles comes to help her
pointing on shelf can you get that down for me
welles climbs the ladder points at boxes
no the next shelf
welles takes down a small suitcase
its covered in dust
he climbs down the ladder with it
what is this
those are her belongings
thats her suitcase
i had forgotten it till you showed me her picture
welles puts the suitcase down examines the luggage tag mary anne mathews no address
welles looks to the nun
whatever possessed you to keep this all this time
she was the kindest sweetest girl youd ever want to meet
oh i adored her
i supposed i always hoped shed be back
after a time all i could do was pray she had moved on to better things
can you get this suitcase to her parents if you think its appropriate
ill do what i can
welles puts marys suitcase on the bed opens it
he takes out some of marys clothing examines it lays it aside
he takes out a rosary more clothing
resting on a sweater are two ceramic figurines a teddy bear and kitten
welles examines them frowning puts them aside
he takes out yellowed newspaper help wanted classifieds july
several job possibilities circled others crossed out
he finds baggie containing a few old joints
all thats left are more items of clothing a toothbrush and an address book
welles examines the address book finds a folded piece of paper in the blank pages unfolds it
its the torn diary page a poem written in marys hand
as welles reads star light star bright first star ive seen tonight wish i may wish i might have this wish i wish tonight
welles goes to a drawer takes out the photocopy of marys diary
he turns to the ragged edge of the torn page puts the diary page against it
welles stands looking at the poem
he turns the page over finds written in cursive models wanted welles dials the number off the back of the torn diary page phone to his ear
it rings rings rings
from phone celebrity films
welles hangs up begins searching the booths yellow pages
a poverty stricken business section of wilshire
welles gets out of his parked car looks up at a decaying art deco building thats painted blue top to bottom
welles crosses through traffic
welles studies the registry finds celebrity films
walls are water stained
welles climbs stairs winded sweating up the stairwell
welles comes out a stairwell door catching his breath
a couple of secretaries wait for the elevator
welles moves down the hall around a corner
each office door has a window of pebbled translucent glass
theres a dental office wilson travel cruises and at the end of the hall celebrity films inc
eddie poole professional casting and distribution suite
welles heads back the way he came
welles crosses back to the other side of the street goes to stand near his car
he looks up at the blue office building counting up floors counting windows across
satisfied he turns backing up looking up at the tall office building across from the blue building
theres a sign on this adjacent building empty office
welles is let in by a disinterested landlord
welles gives a cursory look around goes to the windows and opens the blinds
these windows afford an excellent view of the blue building across the street at about th floor level
this is better
turns to landlord this will be fine
welles has transferred most of his belongings here suitcase open on the floor card table set up with fast food on it an army cot against one wall
welles sits in a chair at the window looks through binoculars on a tripod
through binoculars searching up the dark floors of the blue building as welles counts under his breath
stopping on one window focusing
welles locks the tripod
he goes to sit on the army cot picks up his cellular
he looks at the phone deciding
he puts down the phone
he turns off the lamp on the floor lays back in the cot going to sleep
through binoculars watching the window of celebrity films inc
we can see most of the office from here
its crowded with junk boxes piles of video tapes
theres a disorganized desk by the window
welles sits looking through the binoculars
through binoculars a pudgy man eddie poole in a loud print shirt comes to sit at the desk looks through mail
he smells sleazy even from here lots of jewelry lots of rings
he drinks coffee answers the phone
he talks into the phone looking for something on his desk agitation growing till hes shouting then slams the phone down
he looks to the wall where three photographs culled from the snuff film are pinned up the picture of mary the picture of masked mans tattooed hand and
the grainy image of the third man in the mirror
welles comes to study this third photo
through binoculars eddie packs video tapes into a box covering them with styrofoam peanuts sealing the box
through binoculars eddie finishes a call and hangs up
he sits back in his chair
he starts looking in his desk drawers finds a magazine and opens it on the desk
eddie turns pages looking at naked women
he sits back in his chair begins unbuckling his belt
welles pulls back from the binoculars in disgust
no thank you
through binoculars eddies on the phone pouring himself a drink from the liquor bottle on his desk finishing the call hanging up
he shakes his head in disgust drinks the drink walks out of view
after a moment the lights go out
an old dented car makes its way up the tight twisting roads of the hollywood hills
eddies at the wheel
not far behind welles rental car follows
eddies car pulls into the driveway under the porch of a ramshackle house parks
welles car passes by
welles car slows once its out of sight turns around moving back down the hill slowly
welles turns out his headlights coming around the curve just far enough so the ramshackle house is in view
welles watches eddie walk up the stairs to the house
through binoculars eddie has a visitor
theres a pretty girl wearing a tube top in a chair facing his desk
eddies talking gesticulating smiling cajoling
welles watches through binoculars
through binoculars eddies still taking stands coming around the desk and placing a hand on the girls shoulder
the girl says something
the woman shakes her head getting up to leave
eddie seems to be asking her to stay following as she moves out of view
eddie comes back alone sits at his desk picks up the phone

the salesperson takes the money recounting

the salesperson starts punching keys on the register
the blue building sits completely dark
welles comes quietly out from the stairwell wears gloves
he moves down the hall to the door of celebrity films inc
he kneels begins using lock picking tools on the door
welles enters shuts the door and locks it
he takes out his penlight
there are posters for cheap porn films on the wall that we couldnt see through binoculars
titles like sex doctor deep ass and penal colony
there a two file cabinets
welles pulls a few drawers finds them locked
video cassettes are everywhere on the cabinets on shelves piled high on the floor
welles goes to eddies desk looking in drawers
one drawer is full of x rated magazines
anothers stuffed with paperwork call sheets contracts
welles picks up eddies phone unscrews the earpiece
he takes the small round listening device from his pocket peels off backing to expose adhesive
he attaches the listening device inside the phone puts it back together
welles moves towards the door sweeps the room with the penlight
he stops at the file cabinets takes his lock picking tools out begins working on one files lock
he turns the lock opens a file drawer
he opens another
inside piles of child pornography
welles clenches his jaw
faces of children
girls in pigtails
welles receiver tape recorders set up by the window recording with the tone decoder plugged into it
welles listens through headphone looking through binoculars
through headphones half a dozen
this is good stuff jimbo
through binoculars eddies at his desk on the phone
you know how my tapes sell
people eat this stuff up
from phone i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month

the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap youre peddling eddie
where do you get this stuff

through binoculars eddie slams down the phone
he cannot be heard any longer
hes cursing shuffling paperwork
welles takes off headphones picks up his cellular phone
he drinks soda opens the phone dials nervous then looks back through the binoculars
he waits clears his throat
the phones ringing
on the floor the reels of the tape recorder are turning
through binoculars eddie answers the phone

he gets out his bottle and pours himself a drink
welles watches through binoculars puts headphones back on

through binoculars as dino is heard hanging up eddie reacts picks up his phone and throws it across the office
welles sits back trying to accept the realization that hes found them
he looks to the photo of the third man
that is you isnt it eddie
welles goes to the recorder turns on the tone decoder
its led window lights up
welles hits stop rewind play
from recorder and your pals youre fucked
hits fast forward
hits play watching the tone decoder
from the recorder the sound of eddie dialing a number on his touch tone phone
and as each tone is heard a corresponding number appears on the decoders led readout
the recorder continues replaying the conversation between eddie and dino while welles studies the green led digits
quiet to himself two one two
the brilliant lights of new yorks peerless skyscrapers
follow welles ford as it moves along with traffic crossing the th street bridge into the heart of manhattan
chase manhattan bank mid town
welles puts the mm film into safe deposit drawer shuts it
busy and crowded but quiet
welles places a massive tome down on a table haines criss cross directory
welles sits takes out his notepad referring to the phone number written
he opens the reference book searching pages
thousands of telephone numbers are listed in sequence each with an address
welles runs his finger down the page
streets are clogged with delivery trucks loading and unloading
cars horns blow
welles walks to an old warehouse building shoulder to shoulder with other buildings labeled in burnished steel
welles climbs the stairs examines the buzzers
the top buttons labeled greystone imports the bottom button reads lang interior design by appt
the middle button is labeled only by a drawing of a black widow spider
welles looks up at the building
the sun is low
less activity on the street
welles leans against a car down the street smoking a cigarette
two women walk this way both in spiked high heels dressed in cheap short formfitting skirts both carrying duffel bags
they start up the stairs of
welles throws his cigarette walks to follow
the women hit the center button
a buzzer sounds as they head inside
welles hurries up the stairs catching the door before it closes
welles follows the women into a decrepit elevator
one woman hits
welles hits steps back in the corner
elevator doors creak closed
the two women are heavily made up pretty but worn eyes dull
welles looks down at the leg of one woman noticing bruises through her fishnet stockings poorly covered by make up
elevator doors open on the second floor
the two women get out and walk down a grey hallway towards double doors painted black
welles stops the elevator door from closing
the women push the intercom at the black doors
another dull buzz is heard as the women enter
the low rumble of heavy metal music is heard silenced as doors swing shut
welles lets the elevator close
the elevator opens on the first floor
welles gets out instead of leaving the way he came heads towards the rear
follow him down a hallway past a service elevator
welles comes out back doors into an sunless alleyway with fire escapes above

max opens his suitcase takes out three video tapes
he hands them to welles
the boxes are covered in jumbled photo collages american flag s m men and women a skull mannequins a scorpion cut outs of arms legs and eyeballs
welles is lit by the flicker from the television screen
we see nothing
we hear the rhythmic muffled moans of a woman from the tv cant tell if its pleasure or pain
max is asleep in the bed pizza box near his feet
welles drinks beer gets up and ejects the cassette from a vcr tosses it aside tired
he picks another dino velvet tape puts it in sits
on tv gothic rock is heard over old scratchy images of klansmen around a burning cross
dracula menacing a sleeping woman
a man in a devil costume dancing
welles opens another beer
on tv a woman is tied up arms in the air hanging from the ceiling gagged and blindfolded in a dungeon lit by candelabras
then glimpsed images worms writhing in slime
a guillotine falling
then the bound woman struggling
a masked man in a leather jacket enters
he wears a leather mask with zipper eyes and mouth
this focuses welles attention
on tv the masked man circles the captured woman
max awakens rolling over groggy
points at tv who is this in the mask
who is he
max tries to see eyes barely open
hes one of the lunatics dino uses
hes in a bunch of these
on the tv masked man takes off his jacket shirtless reveals an impossibly muscled body
huge arms thick chest oiled dotted in pimples

on tv the bulging masked man flexes ripped
thats not him
welles rubs his eyes sits back
max sits up watching
on tv masked man pulls the bound womans head back by her hair licks her face with his thick tongue
close on masked man grips the womans head still licking
he pulls down the womans blindfold
welles sits forward realizing horrified
welles goes to the vcr hits pause
the image on tv freezes
welles goes back frame by frame
to the close up where masked man grips the womans face
on masked mans hand a tattoo on the arch between his forefinger and thumb same as the scrawny masked man in the snuff film
a pentagram tattoo
who is he
i told you hes one of dino velvets stock players
who is he his name nobody knows his name
thats his thing
he always wears a mask
you never see his face
he calls himself machine thats what they call him
welles hits play
on tv masked man runs his hands up and down the womans body
the womans eyes are filled with fear
welles sits unnerved watching
they say hes half brain dead from all the steroids hes using
max rolls over trying to get back to sleep
hes a brutal motherfucker man
he loves what he does for a living
welles enters carries an overnight package and his lock box
at the desk he tears open the package opens the manila envelope inside finds fifty thousand dollars in thousand dollar bills wrapped in plastic and masking tape
welles takes the lock box to the bed and works the combination opens it
he takes out the holster stands looking down at the gun
he puts the holster on
welles ford waits with turn signal on
a car pulls out of a parking space
welles takes the space
max is in the passenger seat
welles looks to
you dont need to be here
what kind of junior p
would i be if i didnt go with you
welles and max get off the elevator moving down the grey hall to the black doors
welles pushes the intercom button
after a moment the intercom crackles
from intercom who is it
welles waits presses the button again
the doors buzz and welles and max warily enter this large dark converted warehouse
square pillars shoot from floor to ceiling
shafts of light cut down from high windows
a large thug in a pinstripe suit crosses from a far desk
youre in the wrong place
were looking for mr
hes not here
welles looks around at piles of props a huge faux stone angel and gargoyles elaborate candelabras a huge birdcage massive wooden cross nazi flags
why dont you tell him were here to give him a large sum of money
if hes not interested well go
you should leave now before i have to remove you
welles just stands looking at the thug
a voice is heard
from speakers show them in milo
welles and max look up
there are speakers mounted high up on the pillars and surveillance cameras looking down
you heard the boss milo
the disgruntled thug starts back across the studio towards a distant door
welles and max follow
they notice an elaborate set built in one corner a torture chamber complete with rack and iron maiden
thug opens the door and lets welles and max in
the office is huge windowless walls covered in thousands of pictures from every conceivable source torn and cut pinned up to form an indecipherable collage
a tall ladder leans against one wall near three televisions
dino velvet rises behind his desk a small bird like man wearing a black suit and bad hairpiece
make yourself comfortable
welles shakes dinos hand
max looks up at the walls
images porn pictures news photos world leaders autopsy photos armies and insects the naked and the dead
its an honor to meet you
thank you for seeing us
what can i do for you today
shelves behind dinos desk are piled high with video cassettes old movie cameras big reels of mm film
videos and magazines are stacked everywhere
id like to commission a work
im a great admirer of yours
and whos your colorful little chum
a fellow investor
youre the only one still shooting film and transferring it to video
nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore
the grain the gritty look you get
well im glad you appreciate it
to welles what would you say is your favorite piece
max glances over looks back to the walls
i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil
devil frightened me as much as it excited me but id be hard pressed to choose a favorite
dino grins showing yellowed teeth
you said something about money
what were looking for is rather specific
welles takes out an envelope puts it on the desk
thats five thousand dollars
five thousand now five thousand on delivery
two women one white and one black as long as they have large breasts
hard bondage or course
other than that trusting your artistic interpretation i have only two stipulations
and they are
i want to watch you work
ill consider it
and the other performer
it has to be that monster you use
the man in the mask
if its not him theres no deal
dino drums his painted fingernails on his lips
he might be interested
but it would mean another five thousand
we can do that
well well ill have to put my thinking cap on about all this
youll leave the money as a deposit
off welles nod very good
dino stands picks up a still camera off his desk and comes to look at welles studying him
you have a beautiful face
the way the light hits it
id like to take your picture
you dont mind
id rather you didnt
whats the problem
im camera shy
you trust me to keep your money but not to take your picture
those are two different kinds of trust
stands thank you for your time
i hope we can do business
max goes with him
dino watches them leave
two cars have collided head on
a large crowd gathers
one windshields shattered blood spattered
the driver is slumped over the wheel gushing blood
on a nearby street corner welles in on a pay phone
heavy metal can be heard filtered through the receiver
into phone so what do you say
dinos stands in the middle of his office naked his back to us mm camera in hand on the phone
a naked woman dances for dino
a heavy metal music video plays on a tv
into phone ill do this for you
fifteen thousand dollars
from phone machines in
into phone hes in
it will be his pleasure
from phone be at hoyt avenue three oclock tomorrow
welles digs out his notepad writing
into phone wheres that
dont be late
horns and traffic are heard
max and welles sit in lawn chairs at the tiny pool
max drinks beer
they watch an elderly woman in a one piece bathing suit climb from the pool and walk to the diving board diving in
im trying to figure that out myself
i have to see machine without his mask
still dont want to tell me what youre doing
the old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board
welles takes out a thick envelope hands it to max
this is for you
max doesnt understand opens the envelope finds about fifteen thousand dollars in the envelope
people use it to purchase goods and services
max looks at it again cant believe it
thats awful generous and everything
its not my money
the woman i got it from is never going to give it a second thought
lets not make a big deal out of this okay
pause go be a race car driver
go run for president
welles puts his cigarette out stands
ill see you around
welles walks away heading to his room
max watches him go doesnt know what to say looks in the envelope
the old woman climbs out and heads back to the diving board
a deserted war zone neighborhood of abandoned graffittied buildings
a few burnt out cars on the street
welles drives through watchful
welles drives past a huge two story warehouse does a u turn
he parks the car
welles checks his gun returns it to his holster
welles climbs crumbling concrete stairs looking all directions crossing a loading dock towards a door
welles enters slowly trying to get his eyes to adjust to the darkness
a vast empty space looms before him
in the middle of the warehouse dino velvet stands in a powder blue suit holding an archery bow and arrow
there you are
come join us
theres a wrought iron bed not far from dino
machine is seated on the mattress a huge man wearing a leather s m harness and the same wrestling mask as in the snuff film
welles gathers his courage walks towards them
dino pulls back on the bow aiming away across the warehouse
he stands by a table with a quiver of arrows propped up
he shoots an arrow toward a large target
strikes the target dead center bulls eye
as welles gets closer he notices several things
a mm camera mounted on a tripod facing the bed along with several movie lights several bowie knifes are laid out on the table beside a pair of handcuffs
machine is watching him as he approaches
welles stops not far from dino and machine but keeping his distance
dinos still firing arrows at the target
machines still staring at welles
to machine hello
machine just stares at him with bloodshot eyes
you brought the money
takes out envelope right here
dino lets fly another arrow
another bulls eye then turns to look at welles with a smile
where are the women
they should be here any minute
welles comes forward slowly places the envelope on the table beside bowie knifes
of the knifes what are these for
oh the knifes
theyre just props
nice arent they
dino walks across towards the target
machine and i were just talking about knifes
the beauty of knifes
dino pulls arrows from the target
he was saying how fascinated he is by their simple ability to be sharp
the ability of a piece of metal to be so thin that it is almost nothing
dino walks back to the table replaces the arrows in the quiver cueing another arrow in is bow
so close to nothingness that it cuts with minimum effort because its so non intrusive
flesh is fooled
it blooms open as the blade widens but by then its too late because the knifes already doing its pure simple damage
dino shoots another arrow to the target
a clatter attracts welles attention
far across the warehouse a delivery door rolls upwards
a car with tinted windows drives in
the man who opened the door silhouetted in sunlight stays behind to close the door as the car pulls forward
ah ours guests have arrived
he is a giant
welles takes a few steps back wary sweating hard now
the car parks across the warehouse not far from the target
dino puts another arrow in his bow pulls it taunt aims at the target
turns aims the arrow at welles
would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person
what are you
take out your gun
welles brings his hand towards his holster
let me see it
welles takes out his gun looks across the warehouse
the silhouetted man is walking this way
cant tell who he is yet
machine heads the direction of the parked car
empty the gun onto the table very carefully
look i dont know what this
shut up cunt
do exactly as i say or ill put this arrow through your throat
welles obeys helpless dumps the bullets out on the table
the silhouetted mans getting closer
its eddie poole
is that him
to welles put the gun down take the handcuffs
handcuff yourself to the bed
welles obeys walks to the bed
welles attaches one cuff to the beds iron rail fastens the other cuff around his wrist
dino puts down the bow and arrow
still to welles didnt know what to make of you at first and you certainly had eddie on pins and needles
but lo and behold from out of the blue came an old business acquaintance to explain everything
welles looks across to the car
the sinister lawyer longdale gets out from behind the wheel and hands the keys to machine walks this way
this is the fucker
motherfucker doesnt look like anything
eddie walks around the bed studies welles
welles watches him
eddie goes to stand behind welles rushes forward
punches welles in the side of the head
welles goes down clutching his face
doesnt look like shit
eddie pulls welles to his feet throws him against the bed frisking him from head to toe
longdale comes to stand beside dino nervous taking out a tiny handgun and pointing it at welles
welles looks up holding his head afraid sits on the bed
to welles you remember mr
longdale dont you
i remember him
lets get this over with
dino comes to sit on the bed beside welles
youre going to go get the film you received from mrs
christian bring it here and put it in my hand
and to save time so we make this as efficient as possible theres an incentive
dino puts his fingers in his mouth lets out a sharp whistle
across the warehouse machine uses the car keys to open the trunk of the car pulls someone out
its max beaten bloody bound face swollen gagged hardly conscious
machine throws him to the floor
welles tries to go towards max yanked back by the handcuffs pulls the bed a few inches but its heavy
friend of yours
look hes got nothing to do with this
let him go
can you guess what im going to say next
he doesnt know anything
hes got nothing to do with this
bring the film or we kill him
sorrow and rage rises up in welles but theres no choice
ill get it
its in a safe deposit box in the city
longdale will keep you company
dino takes out handcuff keys throws them to longdale
longdale approaches welles carefully unlocking him
dont let longdales questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas
if his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you youll be just as dead
and so will max
move it dirtbag
eddie comes to shove welles
welles stumbles to the ground gets to his feet
welles walks takes one last glance back towards max
watching them go do hurry
welles car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid town
welles is at the wheel
longdale is in the passenger seat gun held in his lap
you were the middleman am i right
old man christian wasnt about to go shopping for a snuff film himself
wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature
so he sent you gave you the money his errand boy
and if you refused it wasnt like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film
thats the beauty of lawyer client privilege
christian trusted me implicitly
must have paid you a lot for you to risk everything
wouldve had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money
i was well compensated
thats why you got scared when mrs
christian hired me
you knew about the film figured it had to be in that safe
howd you find me
never mind how i found you
must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies
theyre no friends of mine
except youre willing commit murder with them
none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone
if you werent digging up a girl who died six years ago
a girl no one even remembers
mary anne mathews that was her name
her mom remembers her
welles looks at longdale
you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film right
wanted them to find you one
well they didnt find you one longdale they went out and made you one
mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered
shut your mouth and drive
did it get him off huh watching them cut her up
tell me because i really want to understand
did he jerk off to it
you watch it with him sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched
longdale jams the gun against welles side
youre making me very angry
just tell me
tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared
what kind of degenerate pervert was he really
what the fuck did he want with a snuff film
youre asking me why
longdale sits back wipes sweat from his face
a man like mr
christian a great man
all his money all his power
a man who attained everything there was to attain
why did he buy a film of some poor lost girl getting butchered
isnt it incredibly obvious
because he could
he did it because he could
pause what other reason were you looking for
welles tightens his grip on the wheel numbed
welles double parks puts his hazard lights on
longdale sits forward looks to the bank
youve got four minutes till i call mr
velvet and let him know theres a problem
longdale takes a cellular phone from his pocket shows it
welles climbs out heading to the bank
welles and the safe deposit manager enter
they go to put their keys in one drawer unlocking it a pulling it out
may i show you to a booth
no ive got it
welles pulls the drawer open takes the mm film out and hands the empty drawer to the manager exiting
welles comes out from the safe deposit vault pocketing the film crossing towards the entrance looking around
at other customers waiting on line
at a guard with a gun at his side
welles detours toward one of the loan desks
the bank employee behind the desk is occupied on the phone
as welles moves past the desk he grabs a pair of scissors from a pencil holder and palms it heading to the door
welles gets behind the wheel
longdale looks at his watch
you almost went over your limit
welles puts the car in gear and drives
give me the film
youll get it when we get there
longdale puts the gun to the side of welles head
give me the film
go ahead shoot me
then try driving to brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield
welles keeps driving
longdale sits back stewing
the door is kicked open
welles enters takes the mm film out and holds it in his hand
as welles moves forward his face goes slack
machine is seated on the bed eddie and dino stand smoking cigarettes and further on max is tied to the target slumped over three arrows in his chest dead
welles runs towards max crying out tears in his eyes
machine rises goes to intercept welles grabbing him
welles tries to break free but machine lifts welles up and throws him brutally to the ground
welles scrambles to get up
eddie comes to kick welles in the face
welles is sent sprawling blood gushing from his nose
he lays there stunned weeping
eddie pries the mm film from welles hand tosses it
dino catches the film
machine comes to drag welles towards the bed
dino unspools the film holding it up to examine it
machine handcuffs welles to the metal bedframe
welles falls to his knees holding his face
eddie punches welles in the head
youre a dead man
leave him alone
eddie punches welles in the kidney
welles tries to protect himself
eddie raises his fist to punch again but machine catches eddies fist throws eddie back
what the fuck
i promised him to machine
eddie looks up at machine who towers over him
first things first
you might want to watch this mr
welles looks up through tears
dino drops the mm film on the floor takes a small bottle of lighter fluid from his pocket
longdale comes to watch
welles watches helpless agonizing
dino drops the film to the floor sprays it with fluid takes out matches light one drops it
the mm film goes up in flame
welles watches quaking hysterical trying to pull himself towards the flame dragging the bed
the film is destroyed by flame
welles gives up presses his face to the floor eyes shut
and so it ends
its as if she never existed
welles falls back gasping wiping blood and tears and spittle from his face getting slowly to his feet
dont blame yourself
you were in way over your head
he looks to maxs corpse to the smoldering film
swallowing back his fear panic and rage
small time motherfuckers
tell me something
welles spits blood hangs onto the bed for support
i know why you did it dino eddie
but whyd the lawyer do it
must have been a helluva lot of money right
one fuckload of money
welles sits on the bed eyes burning with fury
so what are you all still doing small time huh
what are you still doing in the sewer eddie
christian gave longdale a million dollars to find him a snuff film
how much did you ever see
eddie and dino look to longdale
whats he talking about
one million dollars dino
how much did he tell you he had
longdales getting very nervous
look at him
you think he played it square
how much did he give you how much did he keep for himself
eddie walks towards longdale
what the fucks he talking about
longdale takes out his gun aims it at machine dino and eddie scared
stay away from me
whats going on longdale

eddie slowly takes out his gun seething

eddie puts the gun down kicks it
longdale picks it up throws it far away

welles rental car speeds down the highway east towards pasadena leaving the city of los angeles on the horizon
welles car travels a winding highway that serpentines up into the scenic forested san bernadino mountains
the sun is low
big bear lake is vast surrounded by wilderness on all sides
welles car follows a two lane roadway that runs along the lakes southern shore
welles car passes sporadic summer homes and cabins
heavy forests border close to the road
welles car travels alone headlights on slowing as it comes to an overgrown gravel driveway with a rusty chain strung across it
welles leans forward to look up at an old sign of broken neon and peeled paint big bear motor lodge
welles pulls forward puts the car in reverse
welles car backs up angling till the rear bumper comes against the chain backing
till the chain snaps
welles car pulls forward across the empty roadway turns around
accelerates down the overgrown driveway
welles car comes down the driveway into a small lot
through the windshield headlights reveal whats left of the abandoned motor lodge a registration office at the center with attached wings of rooms on both sides
the left wing of rooms is a fire ravaged burnt out skeleton
what remains of the office and right wing is boarded over falling apart
no window has gone unbroken
welles turns out headlights and parks
he gets out walks to look up the driveway
a car is heard
headlights can be seen a good distance away through the forest as the car passes
welles goes to his car unlocks the trunk and opens it
eddies lying in there arms and legs bound gagged
the door is shoved inward hanging crooked by one hinge
eddie enters first hands still bound behind him
welles pushes eddie forward gun out
welles turns on his penlight flashlight shining it into the room
there dead leaves all over the floor
the rooms empty except for a chair lying on its side
welles sweeps the room with the inadequate light
this is where mary anne mathews died vaguely recognizable from the snuff film without the furniture
what are we doing here
welles goes to the bathroom door keeping the gun trained on eddie pushes the bathroom door open with his foot
the bathrooms cracked mirror reflects the penlight and welles palely lit face
you didnt have to be in the room but you were
looks to eddie why
why did you watch
eddie goes to the chair tips it upright with his foot sits
i dont know
i felt like it
i never saw anyone get done before
you enjoy it

what did i care if some hump wants to beat off to that
it was just something i was doing for money

what do you want to know
you saw it you saw the loop
nobody saw you bring her in
there wasnt nobody around
this place was a shit hole
i backed up the car to the door and we carried her in like groceries
dino made her eat a bunch of pills we laid out the plastic put film in the camera and machine went to work
what did you do with her body
took it out the bathroom window
buried it in the woods
eddie and welles come around the corner of the abandoned motel eddie leading the way welles following with gun and flashlight into the dense forest
what are you thinking youre gonna do
welles shoves eddie ahead
where do you think youre taking this huh
gonna be a big hero avenge that little girls death

welles and eddie come over a hill deeper into the forest
you cant go to the cops
all you can do is cut me loose and walk away because you got nothing
you got absolute zero
show me where you buried her
i dont know
nods to forest out there somewhere
show me where
i fucking dont know
what do you think

we didnt pace it out so we could come back and get it
we dug a hole and we put her in it

welles walks ahead of eddie distraught shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor
youll never find her
nobody ever will and even if they did it doesnt mean nothing
bring in the cops bring in the f
fuck em all
without the film it never happened

welles turns aims his gun at eddie furious

eddies not backing down

put me out of my misery so i dont have to listen to you whining anymore
you think its so easy

eddie walks towards welles
welles backs away

arent i defenseless enough
eddie comes ahead defiant the gun inches from his face
go ahead and kill me
kill me with that gun your gun right registered in your name

welles step forward presses the gun against eddies forehead pulls back the hammer
eddie just stares back at welles with hatred in his eyes
welles is terrified unsure
trying to muster the courage to do it
gun hand trembling
finger on the trigger
eddies thrown face down to the floor
welles comes to sit on eddies back facing eddies feet holsters his gun takes out duct tape and grabs eddies feet wrapping them
welles keeps going around eddies ankles with the duct tape till eddies securely bound
he rips the tape roll free and gets up walking out
welles pulls the door closed behind him walks to his car
welles opens the passenger door and sits shaken at his wits end
he opens the glove compartment finds cigarettes digs one out and lights it
he looks back to the motel room
he looks down to the glove compartment at his cellular phone
after a moment welles picks up the phone looks at it in his hand
welles gets out of the car gets up on the hood lays back staring at the sky
he closes his eyes smokes
welles opens the phone looks at the illuminated numbers
he digs in his suit jacket pocket takes out his notepad pages through studies one page
welles sits up
he gathers himself throws his cigarette dials a number puts the cellular to his ear afraid

mrs mathews is heard screaming letting out a chocking sob
welles falls back against the car holds his head weeping
im sorry im so sorry
there wasnt anything anyone could do
welles pushes disconnect lowers the phone drops it to the ground utterly drained
he puts his forearm over his eyes gasping sucking air
he looks to the motel room tamping down his sorrow willing it to fuel his rage
he takes out his gun hands unsteady determined opens the gun and pours the bullets out
he closes the gun and walks towards the motel room
welles shoves the door aside
the doors hinge breaks and the door falls
eddie sits propped up against one wall turns to look
the door slams to the floor
welles moves forward enraged closing on eddie raising his arm with the gun grasped by the butt
eddies eyes go wide with fear
welles swings the gun down at eddies head
the only sounds come from the night forest
crickets and distant birds
we cant see anything but the total darkness through the open door of the room
a car is heard getting louder as it passes fainter as it gets further away
finally welles comes to the doorway in shock steadying himself against the door frame shirt and suit spattered red
his gun hand and gun are soaked with dripping blood
welles looks back into the room backing away
he turns and goes to his car
welles climbs in the drivers side shoves his bloody gun into his holster tries to wipe blood from his hand onto his shirt revolted
he starts the car
welles enters and crosses through
welles goes to the kitchen sink turns on the water starts scrubbing his bloody hands using dishwashing liquid scrubbing his hands desperately under running water
welles comes out of the house goes to open the rear door of eddies car looking through boxes of eddies belongings
welles comes up the stairs with a box dumps the contents onto the living room floor its child pornography eddies collection from the office hundreds of photos
welles pulls open eddies cabinets searching
he finds pots and pans choosing a few of the largest
welles uses a cut piece of garden hose siphoning gas out from eddies car filling several kitchen pots
welles comes up the stairs carries pots of gasoline dumps the gasoline onto the pile of photographs
welles dumps gasoline over eddies bed
welles stands at the pile of gasoline soaked photos taking out a matchbook lighting one lighting the whole book
welles walks down the dark hill heading to his car
he gets in starts the car and drives downhill leaving the headlights off
behind the windows of eddies ramshackle house grow bright as fire spreads and curtains burn
welles stares ahead in fresh shirt and suit waiting at a the female airline agent behind the counter types in her computer stamps his ticket
welles shifts his gaze something catches his eye
beside a stapler on the counter a pair of scissors
there you are mr
welles confirmed through to kennedy
welles stares fixated on the scissors
welles looks to the agent holding up the ticket
welles accepts the ticket
the empire state building in the distance says nyc and a camera pan down says another seedy motel
welles sits at a small desk looking through a phone book white pages finds
welles picks up the phone chooses a number dials it
into phone hello can you connect me with the duty nurse

welles ducks under the desk to grab the pen off the floor
into phone yes
sits writing in pad christopher higgins
thirty fifteen thirty fifth street
welles is scribbling all this down in his notepad
a relatively quiet residential street
homes are small two story affairs close together each very much like its neighbor some with tiny yards fenced in by brick walls
welles ford comes slowly down the street
children in school uniforms are heading off for the day in groups
welles parallel parks
welles turns off the engine
hes watching a house on the other side of the street
the house is brick on the bottom aluminum siding on top quaint with brick staircase from the front door down to a garage underneath plastic pink flamingos on the small
cars pass in the street
welles watches school children pass on the near sidewalk
he slumps down a little in his seat adjusting the rearview mirror adjusting his side mirror rolling up the window
welles takes a cautionary look around takes out his gun pours bullets out and pockets them
he picks up a paper bag off the passenger seat and opens it
he takes out a long thin metal file pulling off the shrink wrap packaging feels the file with his thumb
keeping his open gun low under the steering wheel welles slides the file into the barrel scraping gently all along the guns inner barrel
welles sits smoking a cigarette watching the quaint house
he looks in his side mirror
theres a large car coming down the block with its turn signal on
welles slumps a little lower
the car passes slowing
the garage door of the quaint house begins to open
cant really see the driver of the car except for the back of his head but hes huge
its a good bet its machine
beside him in the passenger seat is a grey haired old woman
the car pulls into the darkness of the quaint houses garage
after a moment the old woman comes from the garage walks with a cane wears glasses
she goes to the sidewalk checks her mailbox finds it empty
the old woman goes back to the garage
she goes inside
the garage door closes behind her
welles still watches the house
theres a light on in one of the second floor windows curtains closed
welles yawns shaking his head trying to stay awake
at the quaint house a light comes on in the front picture window
looks like a living room or dining room
the old woman comes to sit at a table
welles takes binoculars off the front seat
the old woman says something to someone we cannot see
shes at the dinner table with a place setting in front of her
after a moment someone joins her
its machine you can tell by his bulk by his huge forearms
the lacy curtains of the window block part of our view so we never see his face
welles lowers the binoculars still watching
through the window across the street machine can be seen putting a plate of food in front of the old woman
the old woman smiles up at him says something
machine goes to light two candles on the table with matches then goes back to stand beside the old woman
machine is seen from behind bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek then leaves the room
the old woman starts to eat
dawn light is just breaking
welles has fallen asleep slumped low behind the wheel snoring lightly
welles awakens with a start looking around confused
he calms rubbing his eyes wiping sweat from his features
the quaint houses garage door begins to rise
welles sees this keeps low watching
the big car backs out into the street
the old womans behind the wheel wearing a hat driving away alone
welles watches the car head away in the rear view mirror
welles gets out of his car shuts the door quietly behind him
he starts walking towards the quaint house looks all directions making sure no ones around
ahead the garage door begins to close
welles picks up the pace trying not to look too conspicuous
the garage doors halfway down
welles runs towards the garage has to dive and roll to get there but he makes it under the door just as it closes
in one window of the quaint house an eyeball is peering out from lacy curtains then moves away and curtains fall shut
welles gets up takes out his gun brushing off
the garage is dark full of boxes and junk
welles moves towards the door to the house
machine in t shirt and jeans seen only from behind comes to a dresser and opens a bottom drawer
his huge hands push clothing aside digging deep to the bottom of the drawer taking out the wrestling mask
machine stands straight pulling the mask down over his head
welles enters from the garage gun up
the dank basement is small
a pile of laundry lies on the floor near a washing sheets hang off several clothes lines strung across two metal poles
welles leads with his gun
he moves around the sheets looking behind them
theres a wooden staircase leading upstairs
welles starts up treading lightly trying not to make a sound
welles slowly opens the door to the kitchen pointing his gun
no one here
the decor is feminine neat and tidy
its grandmas house and it shows with gaudy print wallpaper everywhere every shelf displaying hummel figurines or collectors plates
very home shopping network
welles slowly opens the swinging door entering from the kitchen sweeping the room with his gun
no sign of machine
the whole house is dead quiet
he passes the dining room table where he watched the old woman eat last night
passes fake paintings on the walls of waterfalls and sunset mountain landscapes
moves into the living room area
yellow shag carpet
a pink sofa is covered in clear plastic facing an old television in faux wooden cabinet
welles heads for a staircase leading to the second floor
welles creeps up the stairs
welles comes up from the stairs arrives at a closed door
he opens the door
its a linen closet with towels and sheets on shelves and a shelf of medicine
welles shuts the door and moves on
there are two doors ahead both closed
welles takes the one to the right
welles pushes the door in enters warily
theres a constant scratching heard
the room is like a childs except the bed is huge
shelves are full of boardgames and comic books
a danzig poster on the wall
theres a record player with lp records beside it
a record turns on the turntable the needle caught at the center scratching
welles eases his way over to the closet
pulls it open steps back gun up
welles crosses opens the door across the hall enters
down the hall very slowly machines head rises on the stairs in the garish wrestling mask peering
welles stays near the door looks around
theres a fuzzy sky blue comforter on the bed fuzzy blue slippers nearby
lots of bottles of medicine on the bedside table
welles lowers his gun takes a step back into the hall
machine charges down the hall screaming with rage bowie knife raised to kill
welles brings his gun up but machines upon him stabbing
welles catches machines hand stops the knife
machine grips welles gun hand shoving him back
welles is slammed against the wall grappling gun hand pinned
welles gun goes off once
blowing holes in the ceiling
machines grunts pushing the knife forward
closer to welles face
welles struggles overpowered
the tip of the horrible knife is inches away
welles bends his knees crouching trying to gain distance from the blade
machine pulls welles gun hand lower brings it against the swinging laundry chute door built into the wall begins twisting welles hand back trying to pry the gun loose
welles looks out the corner of his eyes to his gun
welles turns his gun hand slowing struggling to aim the gun towards the knife but its awful close to his face
the knifes shaking less than an inch from welles cheek
welles shuts his eyes and turns his head letting out a cry fires his gun
the bullet blasts machines knife knocks it away
machine recoils for a millisecond but brings his now free hand to welles throat choking him
welles face reddens bleeding from bullet fragments
welles tries to pry machines fingers from his throat
machine works on welles gun hand with violent renewed effort slams welles hand against the laundry chute
till welles drops the gun
the gun can be heard clattering down the chute
machine brings his hand to join the other around welles throat
welles cant break the grip
welles punches machines face till blood runs out from the masks nose hole but its having no effect
welles brings his knee up hard into machines stomach
machine falls to his knees with a roar holds his already wounded stomach bleeding through his shirt
welles falls clutching his throat gasping
he struggles to his feet leaps past headlong towards the stairs
machine rises charging after
welles is tackled from behind
welles and machine tumble down the stairs smashing the wooden railing toppling a bookshelf
welles punches and kicks breaking free running across the living room
machine rises to give chase
welles grabs a dining room chair and throws it
machine knocks the chair aside keeps coming
welles grips another chair uses it to hold machine off
machine grips the chair by the legs
welles shoves forward pushes machine back letting go
welles dives under the dining table crawling on his hands and knees scrambling
machine throws the chair runs leaps
machine lands on the table crawls to the far edge grabbing down with his meaty fists as welles moves forward
under the table welles jerks back avoiding then rises extending his knees pushing upwards from underneath
welles flips the table throwing machine to the floor
welles charges towards the kitchen door falls gets up
machine gets to his feet
welles shoves through the swinging door
machine bursts through catching welles tackling him
welles hits the floor with machine on top
machine begins to rein punches down on welles head and back
welles tries to cover up taking a real beating
machine rises gripping welles lifting him throws him
welles smashes into shelves of knick knacks over the kitchen sink shattering a window landing on the sink and counter
machine comes to grip welles again drags him across the counter knocking everything to the floor
machine swings welles releases him
welles slams the refrigerator and slumps to the ground tries to stay conscious trying weakly to get back up
machine comes to welles gets on his knees
machine wraps his arm around welles neck from behind gets him in a choke hold tightens his grip cutting off welles airway with his forearm

beyond him theres the basement door
welles gets to his feet looking
he grabs a frying pan off the counter gripping it in both hands and moving towards machine

welles bashes machine in the face with an upward swing of the frying pan
machine is sent backpedaling crashing into the oven
welles drops the pan leaps over machine to the door
welles comes down the stairs falls when he gets to the bottom barely has any strength left

behind machine comes down the stairs a bloody mess
welles searches the laundry pile
machine reaches the bottom of the stairs heading for welles
welles turns has the gun in hand fires twice
hitting machine in the shoulder and stomach knocking machine a few steps backwards
machines hit in the chest falling back into hanging laundry pulling down the clothes line and sheets
machine hits the ground wrapped in sheets
welles stands still aiming the gun pulls the trigger on an empty chamber
out of bullets
machines trying to pull free from the sheets trying to get back up to his feet
welles lets out a sob drops the gun walking to machine
welles climbs onto machine from behind takes clothing line in hand starts wrapping the cord around machines throat
welles pulls back on the clothes line pulling it tight
machine tries to get his fingers around the cord
welles stands pulling tighter putting a foot on machines back pulling the clothes line with all his might
the cords cutting into welles hand drawing blood
machine face down lets out a gurgling sound struggling struggling
till he finally stops moving

he looks around the basement
welles walks to pick up his gun replaces the gun in his holster
he stands looking at machine
welles walks to machine bends grasps machine wrestling mask pulling it off

welles crosses the street going to his car
he gets into his car starts it pulls out and drives away
kids are kicking around a soccer ball down the street
welles ford arrives pulls into the driveway
welles comes in the front door still a horrible mess
the house is quiet
no one home
a car comes down the street slows
amy sits forward seeing welles car in the driveway
cindys in a child safety seat in back
amy comes in the front door carrying amy
any pushes the bedroom door open and looks in
welles is asleep on the bed still in his clothing and shoes
amy watches him sleep sad
amy backs out of the room pulls the door shut
welles sleeps still in bloody clothing
hes restless shifting muttering under his breath
welles suddenly sits bolt upright in the bed looking around the dark room breathing hard
cindys in her high chair by the table
amys at the kitchen sink washing vegetables peeling potatoes
welles comes to stand in the doorway behind her
amy turns to look at him
it breaks her heart to see him so wounded but she forces herself to continue working in the sink
how much forgiveness do you think i have in me
welles comes into the kitchen stands beside cindy puts his hand out and clasps cindys tiny hand
i cant talk about it yet
amy keeps peeling potatoes refuses to look at him
welles looks down at cindy pats cindys head looks back at amy
he stands looking at amy for a long moment
welles wears his fishing cap pushing his lawn mower mowing his yard
he has done some healing though his face is still swollen and terribly bruised
welles feeds cindy with one hand eating his own dinner with the other
amys across the table eating watching them
welles works on the water heater wrench in hand reading an instruction sheet
he puts the sheet aside uses the wrench to begin loosening one of the pipe fittings
welles drags two garbage cans from the garage to the street leaving them by the mailbox walking back to the house
welles and amy are in bed
amys asleep on her side facing away from welles
welles lays awake on his back staring up at the ceiling
welles pushes a cart down one aisle
he looks at his list takes a box of cereal off one shelf puts it in the cart
welles waits in line with his cart
its a long line
he takes out his wallet opens it
in the fold of the wallet theres a photo folded into quarters
welles unfolds it and looks at it dolefully
its the photo of mary anne mathews the image welles printed from early in the snuff film
welles folds in back up puts it in another pocket
he looks forward in the line to see if its moving
welles transfers bags of groceries from the shopping cart into the back seat of his ford
welles drives on the highway groceries in back
he watches the roadway ahead
theres little traffic
welles glances down turns on the radio
some classical music plays
welles stares forward through the windshield
after a moment welles turns the radio off
the only sound is the drone of the engine and tires
welles is suddenly overwhelmed by emotion eyes filling with tears
he tries to fight it but cant help himself
his face contorts with sorrow and he cannot stop crying letting out a loud wail of misery
welles car moves to the shoulder brakes to a sudden halt
welles takes great deep breathes and lets them out over and over again wiping at his tears
he lets out a little high pitched whine from far back in his throat
hes wracked by sobbing
amys in a chair reading a book not far from cindys crib
the front door of the house is heard opening and closing from far off in the house
amy looks up momentarily then returns to reading
footsteps can be heard coming through the house getting closer
amy looks up from her book
the bedroom doors open a crack
the door slowly pushes open
welles stands there eyes red from crying
welles comes into the room stands before amy
he gets to his knees puts his head in amys lap wraps his arms around her waist
amy holds him worried eyes filling with tears
i have to tell you
i have to tell you what happened
i have to tell you everything but we cant tell anyone else
no one else can ever know
amy runs her fingers through his hair bends down to rest her head on his back holding him with her eyes closed
welles holds tighter

youre all ive ever had
pause youre the only one who can save me
