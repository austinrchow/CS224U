copyright all rights reserved its hard for us here to believe what were reporting to you but it does seem to be a fact
in a corner of the black screen a small tv appears
on it in black white a newscaster sits at an anchor desk
bodies of the recently dead are returning to life and attacking the living
with each click the tv disappears then reappears in a new position on screen
credits roll in the surrounding murder victims have shown signs of having been partially devoured by their murderers
another newscaster is on the tv now sitting in a more modern studio
the broadcast remains in black white
because of the obvious threat to untold numbers of citizens due to the crisis that is now developing this radio station will remain on the air day and night
the second newscaster looks more and more dishevelled
it has been established that persons who have recently died have been returning to life and eating the flesh of the living
we must not be lulled by the concept that these are our family members or our friends
they are not
they must be destroyed on sight
a third newscaster more haggard than the others sits at an anchor desk on a barren set still in black white
every dead body that is not exterminated becomes one of them
it gets up and kills
the people it kills get up and kill
they kill for one reason
they kill for food
if this situation is allowed to continue there will be nothing left
its their world now
sound fades in too
ka tchick tchicky tchick
it makes us nervous
in color a full moon shines over a picture perfect american town
people seen in silhouette stroll past quaint shops whose signs promise reliable appliances well made clothes solid values
a diner has a neon sign that offers the best eats in town
but something is wrong
the neon isnt lit
nothing in town is lit
street lamps windows are all dark
ka tchick tchick
that disturbing sound continues
some of the pedestrians drift into uniontown park milling around a gazebo where three musicians are struggling with a trombone a saxophone and a tambourine
they cant seem to make the instruments work except for the tambourine player who is rattling out a few very unrhythmic beats
thats where that sound is coming from
ka tchick tchicky tchick
a closer inspection reveals the musicians are dead
so are the pedestrians
flesh is rotting off their bones
the town itself which at first looked so perfect is rotting too
theyre trying to be us
they used to be us
worried theyre learning how to be us again
riley denbo watches the town through binoculars
made rugged by realities he has a heart beneath his tough exterior
mike converse young and unseasoned has the eagerness and passion of someone young and unseasoned
some germ or some devil got them things up and walkin
but theres a big difference between them and us
dead teenage couple walks hand in hand near the gas pumps of a defunct texaco station
the boy steps on the little hose that bings when a car pulls in
out of the building comes
it was once tall and handsome
now his face is a wrinkled map of death
he has lost its left arm
dried blood darkens the shoulder of its jump suit where the arm was torn away
a texaco patch tells us the thing used to work here
embroidery tells us his nickname was once big daddy
he goes to the pump and removes the nozzle
turns as if searching for a car to fill with gas
there is none
its like theyre pretending to be alive
isnt that what were doing son
pretending to be alive
the sound of groaning wood as three heavily armed guerillas push a large crate over a precipice into a deep garbage pit below
five similar crates lie amid the rubble
human skeletons most headless lie everywhere no flesh left on their bones
those with heads show various wounds to their skulls
except for one which
suddenly startlingly moves
its bony arm reaches up from the bottom of the pit toward
cholo demora a latino in his s handsome roguish and confident
a bit too confident
he reaches over his shoulder and unstraps a crossbow
cholo shoots the skeleton
his arrow goes completely through the white skull
the doors of a beat up white moving van open
cholo reaches in throwing back an oilcloth that covers another crate
whole lotta trash this week
thats life brother
a whole lotta trash
as the men tip the crate onto a dolly maggots are revealed in the darkness beneath squirming in a pool of blood
whats in that crate
riley and mike watch three dead things lumber toward them from the town below
they know were here
they can smell life
through the binoculars big daddy replaces the nozzle in the gas pump
sensing something it looks around
his dead eyes lock on rileys
big daddy grunts
responding to him
the three dead things move up the hillside with more determination
glancing at mikes guns you any good with those
its my first trip
never had to use em before
im out here with a guy who cant shoot
mike stands turns and
is grabbed from behind by a zombie
its not one of the three theyve been watching
this one wears the remains of a clown suit
half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away
painted eyelashes make its stare alarming
its orange hair is crawling with spiders
it wrestles mike to the ground
opens its lipsticked mouth
is about to bite mikes neck when
riley fires his
a bullet shatters the clowns shoulder cap
the dead thing is pitched backward but seems to feel no pain
it hunkers over mike again
iley fires four more times
three bullets rip into the clowns chest neck cheek
finally the fourth punches a hole above the things left eyebrow
the clown drops
ike looks at riley
you cant shoot neither
riley and mike step into a tight uncomfortable space
the two men open a storage locker and strap on ammo belts as
something terrible looms out of the shadows
it moves toward riley and mike who cant see it from behind the locker
the left side of the things face has been burned away
only scar tissue remains and a single usable eye bulging from a socket
sees the thing
and surprisingly he relaxes recognizing charlie houk a heavily armed guerilla whose intellect is as burned as his face
tcha doin riley
havin a bad dream
i have bad dreams
just look at me you can tell that i have terrible dreams
the town is full of walkers
every town is full of walkers
these arent just walking
but theyre dumb riley
hell dead folks is near as dumb as me
you learned how to make yourself useful
thats what theyre doing
they dumped the trash
cholos on his way
riley and mike look across the room in the direction of the voice
twenty feet away a woman sits at the controls of what looks like a scavenged airplane cockpit thats outfitted with a mixture of high and low tech equipment
she wears a black leather jacket with pretty boy emblazoned across the back
surprised pretty boys a dame
this one is
last one was a guy
what happened to him
pretty boy turns poking her finger through a bullet hole encrusted with year old blood in the chest of her jacket
i kept his jacket
for good luck
put some flowers in the graveyard
pretty boy reaches out and flips a toggle switch on the control panel
deep concussive sounds can be felt as much as heard as
riley charlie and mike step out of a vehicle the size of a city bus
the words dead reckoning are painted on its side
this is no bus
its a war wagon built of scavenged parts with a riveted steel skin
gattling guns protrude from a mean looking snout
a roof turret supports two fourteen inch cannons
rotating lights shine in all directions piercing the night
that sound again
mortar tubes on the vehicles roof are launching fireworks that burst in the sky
looking up flowers in the graveyard
why do you call em that riley
i dont get it
these here flowers aint the kind you lay down on the ground
these here are sky flowers
way up in heaven
i love ya charlie
cuzz you still believe in heaven
the white moving van rolls in and parks beside dead reckoning
cholo jumps out with the three guerillas from the dump
you guys scope out the town
looks like nobodys hit it before
four guerillas get into an old t bird convertible mounted with machine guns
two other armed men climb onto motorcycles
the very night seems to growl as everyone starts their engines
just look at me ou can tell im always ready
i look at you all i sees an idiot
i dont think thats all you see
bet you see this iron too
charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms two shouldered automatic rifles a remington
and a sly smile that makes us wonder whether hes an idiot or not
lets go have some fun
aint about fun cholo
the t bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town
we go in do our job and get out all of us alive okay
i dont want any fuck ups on my last day out here
grinning my last day too
iley looks surprised
cholo mounts a motorcycle revs the engine and heads out
whatd he do hit the lottery or somethin
riley and charlie start to get back into dead reckoning
mike follows pausing to look up at the sky flowers
do those things really work
almost sadly stenches cant take their eyes off em
dead things stand completely frozen in the middle of main street like statues mesmerized by the fireworks
only one figure is moving
he weaves between his brothers and sisters urgently waving his one good hand like frankensteins monster as if to say bad
he has learned that fireworks bring danger
a dead teenage cheerleader holding filthy pom poms looks at big daddy unable to grasp what hes trying to communicate
a spear is driven through the cheerleaders face
the spear is held like a lance by harry a guerilla who roars past on his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round up
other bikers rumble down the street firing guns
big daddy watches the cheerleader fall
it throws its head back and lets out a great howl
through the windshield riley recognizes big daddy from the gas station
he also recognizes the things anguish as
dead reckoning mortars still shooting fireworks stops on the edge of town
cholo pulls up alongside on his bike
through the windshield riley and mike watch the t bird roar down main street
the four guerillas inside laugh gleefully as they use the machine guns to mow down hapless zombies
i thought it was gonna be a battle
this is a fucking massacre
through an open hatch kid these are the toughest guys in the hood
you cant keep em from wantin to get some chuckles
iley gives cholo an irritated look
hey not me boss
you told me not to have any fun im not having any fun at all
to mike come with me kid
ill show you the ropes
mike climbs out and gets on the back of cholos motorcycle
where you goin
to get supplies
thats job our job aint it
the white moving van pulls up to a supermarket
the dead things in the parking lot gazing at the fireworks barely notice the vehicle
marksmen keep the lot covered as guerillas carry cases of canned goods out of the supermarket and into the van
the team has this down to a science
ileys voice comes over one guerillas hand held radio
hows the food
into his radio lousy but theres lots of it
dead reckoning rumbles down a side street its steel skin reflecting the flash of fireworks
pretty boy drives
riley stands beside her
into radio number two whats your location
need an aspirin
i got a million of em
into radio antibiotics
we need antibiotics
into radio number three
uerillas load boxes of ammo into a jeep
into radio guns and ammo boss
harry the biker with the spear is making another run toward a walker who stands mesmerized by the fireworks when
harry is sent flying
dead woman once pretty wearing a softball uniform that bears the number nine has used its bat to hit a home run
harrys riderless motorcycle fishtails up the street and hits the side of a building
arry tries to get up
two dead things attack him
another motorcycle driven by anchor who looks like popeye rumbles up in the nick of time
harry jump on
fighting off the dead things harry gets on and speeds away
pretty boy turns a corner
out the windshield riley sees
cholo and mike on cholos bike joining up with foxy a red haired guerilla on his own motorcycle
the three drive toward the end of town
what the fuck
cholo screeches to a stop at a liquor store with mike and foxy
all dismount and start toward the entrance
they stop as dead reckoning pulls up and riley and charlie climb out
nothin in there but booze
booze aint essential
a jug of good kentucky goes for fifteen hundred back in town
to cholo im not risking anybodys ass just so you can pick up some side money
not askin you to
cholo and foxy start into the liquor store
the doors are wide open
all that can be seen from outside is darkness
but mike has followed the others inside
cholo unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously into the dark space
every subtle sound in the silence puts mike more on edge
his hand tenses on his gun as shadows loom in front of him
shadows that could be zombies but are not
behind the dusty glass doors of a once refrigerated wall unit cholo sees a case of dom perignon
he goes to the refrigerator
re strapping his crossbow he opens the door
reaches in for the case of champagne
his two hands grab it
cholo looks up
the refrigerator has no back wall
a dead thing with a manson like swastika tattooed in the center of its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading area beyond
it grabs cholo with a terrifying growl
cholo falls under the weight of the champagne and the weight of the dead thing which drops on top of him
they roll struggling
the thing holds cholo in a death grip
at the front of the store mike fumbles with his rifle
foxy shoots at the dead thing and misses
cholo punches the thing with his free hand
the dead things head recoils but lowers again toward cholo the swastika looming drooling teeth baring for a bite
cholos eyes flash
its the first time weve seen him scared
charlie fires one round right into the center of the swastika on the zombies forehead
the thing crumples
aint no such thing as nice shootin
a foot kicks the zombie off cholo who looks up to see
riley extending a hand to help him to his feet
im still here aint i
cholo picks up the case of dom
the others head toward the front of the store
tilt down to the floor as their feet move past
in the gloom behind stacks of cartons
a dead hand appears
look out kid
the hand grabs mike around the ankle
mike turns raising his gun
a dead uniformed policeman the skin on half its face stripped down to bone rips a hole in his leg with its teeth
ike screams staggers into a wall and drops to a seated position on the floor
riley and charlie spin around at the sound of his cry
cholo closest to mike pulls his crossbow and fires an arrow through the zombies head
cholo tucks away the crossbow grabs a box of cohibas off a counter and runs outside with foxy
riley goes to mike
kneeling its alright son
youre gonna be alright
you get bit by one f those things and you become what they are
riley wraps a strong arm around mike and lifts him
mike quickly plants the barrel of his
under his chin and
iley stunned lets the corpse slide to the floor
he looks into the rookies open eyes devastated
the white moving van the t bird and the jeep roll out of town in a convoy
trailing them three sadistic guerillas on motorcycles roar past firing
a hail of bullets at a dead family on the sidewalk
the mother falls
it has been grabbed and shoved down to the ground by
who grabs the little girl next thrusting her roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car
the father is last
big daddy grabs it from behind by its hair just as
rounds from an uzi drill a dotted line across the fathers neck
big daddy is unhurt but spattered with blood
not red greenish black
the blood of the dead
heres a ripping sound as the fathers neck is pulled apart by the weight of its limp body
the body drops to the street
the head remains suspended in big daddys hand
his face contorts
his mouth opens and closes trying to utter sounds
ig daddy drops the head looking down at its befuddled eyes with sympathy
after a moment the sympathy is joined by rage
big daddy lifts his right foot and brings it stomping down on the disembodied head crushing its skull
the convoy roars off leaving a cloud of exhaust
big daddy sees harrys downed motorcycle lying in the street
the butt of an automatic rifle protrudes from a saddlebag
big daddy goes over
pulls out the rifle
tests the weight of it in his hand
curls his finger in through the guard and pulls the trigger
a bullet ricochets off a brick wall
big daddy is startled at first
then he relaxes realizing the rifles power
with surprising dexterity he slings the weapons strap over his head and across his chest patting the strap as if comforted by it
turning he looks toward
the distant glow of a skyscraper that can be seen on the horizon
thats the direction the convoy is headed
thats where the bad men came from
thats where he wants to go
with the city in the distance big daddy starts walking
number nine falls into step beside him
soon there are more
none of them knows where they are going
all that seems to matter is that they have a leader
dead reckoning emitting tendrils of hot steam from twenty steel nostrils stands parked in a corner of a fenced in outdoor yard
we dont see how big the yard is
a searchlight sweeps the darkness as guerillas unload the supplies they took from uniontown and carry them toward
a set of rusty steel doors above which is a faded sign that reads subway to city
in the bustle of activity harry the biker who was attacked in town perspires as he helps unload
he looks ill
riley walks past handing out bottles of beer to the men
harry doesnt answer
lunges at riley like a beast
riley has no time to reach for his gun
the harry thing is strangling him
smashing the neck of a beer bottle on the snout of dead reckoning riley jams the jagged glass into the harry things forehead
its body drops to the ground
got knocked off his bike in town
must have been bit
riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret
a mile long subway tunnel extends into blackness
a wide platform runs the length of the tracks at the head of which a derelict train is parked
a cargo carrier pulls out driving along the platform its flatbed piled with supplies while another carrier is being loaded with boxes of food pharmaceuticals ammunition and
shit happens riley
blaming himself only if you let it
the cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the tunnel
ceiling lights spaced far apart stutter on and off
two guerillas anchor and mouse who looks like a mouse ride on the open flatbed with the cargo
the tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast menacing shadows
mouse shifts nervously
something wet falls on his face
wipes his cheek with his sleeve
i hate going under the fuckin river
he takes out a joint
the match flares
mouse and the match are soaked by water dripping from above
rivers flank a triangle of land where a city glows in the sunrise
once proud and prosperous its buildings now seem like tombstones
seven barricaded bridges span the rivers
protected on three sides by mighty rivers the city stands as a monument to mans ingenuity
at the center of it all is fiddlers green
a tv monitor broadcasts views of a kitchen a plush living room a den with a video fireplace
luxury living in the grand old style
dine at one of three restaurants
look for that perfect gift in our fabulous shopping mall
he monitor shows a huge atrium with shops and restaurants
they make it sound nice
it is nice
holding his case of dom perignon and his box of cohibas cholo looks with foxy at a monitor mounted to a white tiled subway station wall
down the tunnel behind them the other guerillas unload supplies from cargo carriers parked on the platform
a sign reads golden triangle fiddlers green
foxy moves away leaving riley and cholo alone
two people dead
that kid mike
he should be here with us right now
i didnt kill him
he got bit and he killed himself
same thing i woulda done
iley lunges at cholo takes hold of his shirt and slams him against the wall
the fuck are you turning into man
e take money to do nasty shit
shit that nobody else is dumb enough to do
we go in knowing the risks
the kid did too
his number came up thats all
we take the risk to bring in things people need
not to make a few extra bucks selling liquor
you used to know that
everybody makes their own way
verybody makes their own ucking way
holo shrugs out of rileys grasp
behind them the guerillas continue to unload cargo
he picked fruit penny a piece
he never went for anything so he never had anything
im gonna have a place riley
my own place
and now i got enough money to buy my way in
isnt it time
isnt it your time
for fiddlers green
cholo looks up at the tv monitor
riley follows his gaze seeing well dressed people sipping cocktails in a club room
youre dreaming cholo
theyd never let me in
theyll never let you in
were the wrong kind
the image on the tv monitor changes to an overhead view of the city and its rivers
animation draws a red line along the base of the golden triangle a zone known as the throat
bask in the security of a city protected not only by its natural boundaries but by hand picked members of its own private militia
in live action not on the monitor weary troops sloppily uniformed guard four rows of electrified barbed wire fencing
dead things cluster by the dozens outside the barricades
corpses hang all along the stretch suspended on the barbs
ten o clock
a walker lumbers in and touches the fencing
the things flesh is literally cooked
boils develop popping open emitting smoke
still the thing remains animated
take its fuckin face off
udda budda budda
the military woman fires
the thing is decimated
its body hangs welded to the sparking barbs
cholo approaches a checkpoint manned by two security guards
setting down the champagne and cohibas he unstraps his weapons and hands them over
supply unit whats in them boxes
for the man upstairs
the guard takes cholos weapons and returns a claim check
cholo collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that carries him up into an enormous atrium
the mall we saw on tv
sunlight splashes through glass walls onto box planted trees
caged birds chirp seemingly in tune with the chopin that lilts over a sound system
shoppers expensively over dressed stroll past stores
other residents lunch at outdoor cafes
cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the smudges off his face trying to make himself presentable
fiddlers green a heavily protected high rise in the center of the city dominates the skyline
its where the fat cats live protected from urban decay
the building is surrounded by unoccupied high rises that define the golden triangle a clean section in the center of the city
no ugliness in view
riley and charlie cross a manicured plaza to a checkpoint manned by two security guards
riley hands over his id
quittin time deke
holding up the id youre gonna need this
walking on nope
when i said quittin time i meant quittin time
riley and charlie walk down a street into the citys ghetto zone which is lined with taverns gambling clubs strip joints like a boom town from alaskan gold rush days
buyers and sellers lurk in the shadows copulating dealing drugs
iley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes greeting them in return with a smile and a nod handing some bills to a father with a young son patting an
old man on the back
wanna get a drink riley
just ook at me you can tell i could use a drink
gotta see a man about a car
charlie follows riley who strides into
an alley surprised to find a cadre of rough looking revolutionaries led by mulligan a defiant man who stands on a soapbox
a small audience is gathered in front of him
he takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey
irish accent how long are you gonna let him push you around
if there was enough of us
if you all would join up with us
we could pull him down off his throne
some of the people in the audience nervously shift their eyes to the fiddlers green high rise ten blocks away
you cant fix a place like this mulligan
you just have to get out of it
weve got the firepower riley
if you and your friends would come in with us wed be unstoppable
mulligan holds out his bottle to riley who passes it to charlie who takes a swig
we hear the sound of a boy coughing
mulligans son brian stands behind him looking feverish
you alright son
im fine dad
as riley starts past he stops pulls something from his pocket and presses it into mulligans palm
for your boy
mulligan looks down with gratitude at a bottle his hand
when he looks up again riley is gone
turning a corner riley and charlie stop in front of a rundown garage with a tarp hanging down instead of a door
riley pulls it aside and looks in
a hobo lies asleep on a grease stained floor curled under some old newspapers
wheres the car
waking what car
my new car
i paid for it
i was here yesterday
there were two guys getting it ready for me
there was nobody here this morning
what happened riley
didja get fucked
riley stands there grim faced
a whisper come on
an elevator door opens
cholo carrying the champagne and cohibas steps out walks to penthouse number one and rings the bell
an instant after he pushes the button
the door is jerked open by tyler knipp something an african american man in a white butlers jacket
frightened hes wielding a scissors poised to strike
lowering the scissors oh mister demora
mister kaufman aint home and theres some shit goin down
a scream rings out down the corridor
i heard that
sure gonna be upset about this
cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor
i called security
they should be here
cholo reaches the door to penthouse number two
another scream from inside
he flings himself at the door
the latch splinters out of the frame
the door bursts open
and cholo enters a dark foyer
the only light comes from another room somewhere inside
a soft rhythmic squeak like a childs swing moving back and forth echoes through the apartment
its an eerie incongruous sound
on guard eyes straining cholo moves inside
the squeak gets louder the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees
a middle aged man hanging dead from a homemade noose suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen
the body sways slowly the harsh glare making the mans face even whiter than it is
a toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet
cholo stands transfixed for an instant
and in that instant
he is grabbed from behind
he whirls ready to kill but finds only a middle aged woman something wearing a tailored suit and expensive jewelry her perfectness blemished only by her hysteria
my johnny he killed himself he killed himself
cholo shakes her hard
keep it together lady
behind them in the kitchen unseen a dazed young man walks up to the hanging corpse
he rights the toppled chair and steps on it lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose
softly to himself dad
to cholo se security
are you security
then for gods sake who are you
she resumes her screaming
in the kitchen the young man is slicing through the rope when his dead fathers eyes pop open
the young man is too busy with the rope to notice
the hanged mans eyes blink
its body twitches
the hanged man turns making a move on the young man
the motion increases the strain on the light fixture which pulls away sparking from the ceiling and crashes to the floor along with the hanged man and his son
the entire apartment is plunged into darkness
the woman stops her screaming
almost as soon as she does a snarl can be heard from the kitchen followed by another scream this one coming from the young man
cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a poker and a matchlight which looks like a pistol but shoots fire from its tip
he approaches the kitchen using the flame to light his way
in the flickering glow he sees
the young man lying on the floor
chunks have been bitten out of his neck and wrist
the body is convulsing in the last moments of life
the hanged man is nowhere to be seen
cholo stands over the young man and stabs him in the head with the poker jabbing the point all the way through
the woman screams again from the kitchen doorway
i gotta hear
whered he go
whered the other guy go
cholo pulls the poker out of the young mans head
he follows them to the other end of the kitchen probing the darkness with his matchlight
the sounds are louder here
cholo lifts the poker ready to strike
just as he does
the back door of the apartment bursts open and a security guard lunges into the kitchen rifle in hand
to cholo drop it
cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands
hey no problem
two more security guards come through the apartments front door and rush into the kitchen
no problem no problem
but there is a problem
theres a dead guy walkin around in here
the hanged man appears without warning attacking one of the guards who just entered biting off half his left cheek including the eye
before his partner can raise his gun the woman grabs it from him
aims at the hanged man
she fumbles with the weapon not knowing how to make it work
the bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his legs
the dead thing holds him up as if waltzing with him biting him again and again
cholo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the hanged man
i need help
i need help
cholo kills the bitten security guard too
cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard
you wanna talk about this
i did what i had to do
i only did what i had to do
riley and charlie step into the cellar of an old brownstone
the place is filled with smoke and buzzing with flies
as riley and charley turn their guns over to two big bruisers inside a tout named roach sidles over
eyeing the weapons supply run last night uh
bet you have some money in your pocket
i can show you how to turn that money into more money
maybe i can find him for you
come on in
riley is already in
he has pushed past the tout and is striding into a fog where gamblers are rushing to place bets with heavily armed bookies
were reminded of a cock fighting joint in a pancho villa movie
lot of action tonight
gotta new kind of game
iley strides toward a cluster of bettors
a very tall man stands among them wearing a texas stetson that sticks up high above all other heads its peacock feathers poking even higher out of a snake skin
iley grabs him and spins him around
he mans feet are off the ground
way off the ground
far from tall hes a little person who has been standing on a platform wearing a purple satin pimp suit
hes a latino who looks like a chihuahua
and thats his name
put me down
put me down
what happened to my fucking car
theyre fixing it up
i went over to the garage
your guys arent there
the cars not there
my dineros not there
hey this is not me
i did not do this to you
i am your friend
put me down
i find out what went wrong
just get me the car or theyll carry you out of here inside that fucking hat
in a dark catacomb dead men are chained to the walls
a pole shoots out
a noose on the end encircles the neck of a captive dead man and is cinched tight
two men hold the pole while a third sprays red paint on the things face
another dead thing is dragged in and sprayed with black paint
cursing in spanish chihuahua pulls a glock out of a filing cabinet and jams a magazine up its butt
riley and charlie drift into a large room thats packed with bettors hooting and hollering like football fans
theyre all jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an iron mesh structure that looks like a lion tamers cage
the painted walkers are thrust inside the cage
their nooses are released
the gates are locked behind them
ead red alarmed by the color of dead blacks face reaches out and gently touches the paint
its fingers come away with blackened tips
lack follows suit staining its fingers red
black licks its hand spitting when it identifies not blood but something distasteful
bookies drift among the spectators taking bets with fists full of cash
what are they betting on riley
red or black
whos gonna win the fight
stenches dont fight
they do when theres food
the tout sidles over
whats on the menu today
cat or dog
i told you
today its something new
another gate opens in the cage
a hush falls as everyone awaits what will come
including the dead men who gaze with anticipation at the opening
what comes is
alive badly bruised her dress in tatters
despite tarnish she still looks sexy
last night she was a hooker known as slack
now shes meat in a lion cage
jesus fucking christ
the gate slams shut
the dead things walk toward the woman
riley rushes off
lack backs up hits the wall of the cage and terrified starts to circle its iron perimeter
the dead men flank her
black is the first to touch her
the crowd howls
lacks terror turns to determination
she punches black three times in the face
the thing recoils as she glides out of its grasp
riley and charlie reach the bruisers who took their weapons
give us our guns
handing over the weapons you leavin
riley cocks his m
in a little while
in the ring black reaches for slack again
with one lightning fast move she kicks it in the chest sending it flying into reds arms
red shoves black aside
black makes another try for the woman
red grabs its rival
this time black hangs on to reds shirt
the two twirl around in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match
slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb
but she almost falls as the cage shakes with the force of
red slamming black against the mesh
on their way back through the arena riley and charley push through the crowd trying to reach the center ring
a goon steps in front of them
no guns in here
riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on
lack continues to climb the cage almost out of reach but black grabs one of her ankles pulling her down and slamming her to the ground
black hunkers drooling over slack
as it is about to bite rat a tat
a short burst from rileys m shatters blacks collarbone
the thing drops
red lunges for slack
riley kills it with another short burst
he crowd panics stampeding toward the exit
suddenly more bullets fly this time from a glock fired by
chihuahua who in a rage is pushing through the legs of the fleeing crowd
he makes it to a clear spot and draws a steady bead on a target
chihuahua pulls his trigger
riley beats him by an instant firing the m
just as chihuahuas gun goes off
a line of bullet holes perforates the little mans belly
the round from his glock misses charlie completely
riley runs to the cage where slack stands trembling just on the other side of the bars
she nods gratefully
hihuahua is still on his feet
and now he is really pissed
not because of the holes in his gut but because
you fucked up my new suit
riley turns to chihuahua but doesnt have time to lift the m before
the little man fires at him
slack delivers a powerful kick into the flexible fencing sending riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from
chihuahuas round which misses riley
but hits slack
spun around by the impact she falls face down
chihuahua continues to fire
riley marine crawls as bullets punch around him sparking off the cage
chihuahua keeps coming keeps firing until
a single shot from charlies
shatters his skull
he drops like a broken pinata
riley looks up seeing two other men with guns
for a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is going to break out
but before it does
four policemen burst in
the goons lower their weapons
riley runs back to the cage blasts the lock on the nearest gate and rushes inside
slacks body is lying on the floor
he suspects shes dead
when her body moves he suspects worse
he plants the barrel of his m against her temple
im alright im alright
slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting position
her right arm is bleeding up near the shoulder
ucker got my right arm
im a lefty
they look into each others eyes
seen you around
seen you around
a policeman steps over
the hell happened here
somebody shot the little fat man
yeah i see that
youre under arrest
a uniformed guard leaves cholo in a pristine white conference room with glass walls overlooking the rotting city far below
cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of cohibas on a conference table
a sman stands in silhouette at the windows
how was uniontown
death intrudes on us even in the green im afraid
i heard about what happened with my neighbors
im grateful for your help
brought you back some presents
cholo opens the case of champagne
he pulls a bottle out untwists the wire and uses his strong thumbs to pop the cork
ou probably want a glass dont you
sure a high toned man likes to drink out of a glass
cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard pours champagne into it and brings it overflowing to the silhouetted man
i got something else too
cholo tears open the box of cohibas
he picks up two cigars bites off the tips puts one in his mouth then walking back to the silhouetted man puts the other in his mouth lighting them both
with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans
no thank you
thats what i got comin for last night
i never bothered to pick it up
i left it in the bank
with all my other dough
rom all those other nights
i got enough now to buy me a place
you mean here
in the green
the silhouetted man steps away from the window
expensively dressed in his early s he is paul kaufman
he sets down the highball glass cholo gave him gets out a proper champagne flute and fills it from the bottle smiling politely at cholo
im sorry mister demora but theres a very long waiting list
this is an extremely desirable location
space is limited
you mean restricted
well i do have a board of directors a membership committee that has to approve
a wave of incomparable sadness sweeps over cholos face
i guess it takes more than money to become a member
take my advice
withdraw your funds from the bank and spend them somewhere else
quietly dont do this to me
dont do this to me
im sorry but
no no no
three years i been cleaning up after you taking out your garbage and you tell me im not good enough
youre the one whos no good
you are no fucking good
and you are gonna let me in
you know why
because i know what goes on around here
how many of your fucking members know whats in that garbage i take out for you
cholo lunges at kaufman grabs him by the collar
cholo feels the barrel of a
against his waist
kaufman who has drawn the pistol from his jacket is still smiling
maybe we should talk about this when youre less excited
kaufman presses a button under the table
three security guards rush in grab cholo and drag him away
kaufman stops one of the guards at the door
softly i wont be needing this man any more
he security guards lead cholo down the stairs
cholo whirls like a ninja
he slugs one guard kicks another in the groin the third in the face and escapes through a fire door
riley rips off part of his shirt sleeve and starts to bandage the wound on slacks arm
they are in a jail cell that has brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley
charlie stripped of all his guns stares outside longingly
to slack why you
in that arena
why did the little fat man throw you in with those things
it wasnt the little man
it was the big man
the man upstairs
hes got his fingers in everything down here
if you can drink it shoot it up fuck it or gamble on it it belongs to him
hes just seein that we get a few cheap kicks so we dont go thinkin too hard about why hes eating steak and the rest of us are lucky to
get the bones
they found out i was working with mulligan and his people
tired of eatin off cbones
what can you do
every place is the same
places with people
im gonna find me a place where there aint no people
wherever youre going take me ith you
riley likes to be alone
he might take me
cuzz havin me around is pretty much the same as bein alone
glancing at riley can make myself useful
and i an shoot
i can shoot
and i can be pretty fucking useful
i had training
i was gonna join the army
up the green
till somebody figured id be a better hooker than a soldier
i dont need to hear your story
everybodys got a story and im tired of hearin them all
whats your story riley
they look at each other clearly attracted
i said everybody has a story
that was wrong
i dont have one
daddy was a preacher
mama kept the house
nothing bad ever happened to me
till everything changed
everything changed for all of us
whether we had a story or not
a sound outside the window
charlie glances through the bars
riley and slack look out the window
four security men are chasing mulligan into the alley outside
they drive him like an animal against a wall club him and drag him away
riley instinctively reaches through the windows bars but theres nothing he can do
its a helpless feeling
what are they gonna do
not right away
first theyll try to get what they can out of him
about people like me
riley puts his hand on her back
in a ratty bedroom foxy is wakened out of a snore by cholo
were taking the truck out
get he guys
no not him
just the regular uys
know what i mean
crane down from a faded sign tonys automania high above what was once a car dealership but is now a fenced in depot full of vehicles
a huge white face with black cartoon eyes pops into view attached to a ten foot tall body emblazoned tony baloney
its one of those vinyl advertising dummies that does the hula as air pumps through it
tonys arms wave wildly like a giant zombie comic yet oddly unnerving as
bullets hit it in the face and neck
gus a young soldier and his partner barrett are shooting outside the sales office of the car lot turned depot
a sign is printed on the window
best deals in town and thats no baloney
handing gus a five you win
you got him in the brain
cholo pulls a cargo carrier to a stop along the platform of the tunnel
foxy pretty boy mouse anchor and scar the youngest of the team leap off the flatbed
the steel doors under the subway sign open and cholo strides out with his team
a depot guard steps forward as the doors close and lock automatically behind them
whats up cholo
flashing an official looking paper takin the truck out
you just got back in this morning
nobody gets a day off these days
taking cholos paper hey wait a minute this is from yesterday
keeping his cool oh i must have given you the wrong one
cholo reaches down but not into his pocket
for his gun
just before he draws it
shots ring out
just target practise
double or nothing
gus aims his rifle at the jerking head of tony baloney
as he is about to fire theres a sound at his back
quit scratching around back there
youre tryin ta fuck up my aim
im just standin here
im not doin nothing
the sound comes again
from the woods that adjoin the lot
barrett grabs the handles of a klieg light mounted on a pivot and swings it so that it illuminates the tree line
heres nothing there
nothing but branches being slapped by erratic gusts of wind
barrett pivots the klieg light back to its original position jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals
a dead thing within arms length
the dead thing drops out of frame replaced by another
barrett shoots again
this creature collapses
it is also replaced by another which is also shot as
the top of barretts head is taken off by a rifle shot
the rifle was fired by big daddy
the barrel is still smoking
in the darkness behind him stands number nine
behind number nine are the shuffling shadows of many more dead things
theyre all over the place
the depot guard turns and runs toward his men
cholos team unstraps weapons and gets ready for battle
stopping them aint our fight
stenches are making it easy for us
lets grab the truck
holo and his team sprint across the lot to dead reckoning
a gunner at a machine gun battery opens fire on the walkers
many of the rounds spark off the wire fencing
cholo and his team scramble into the vehicle
should we send up some sky flowers
those things want to get in here
let em in
the walking dead march through machine gun fire behind their leader
he is the first to reach the fence surrounding the lot
pushing against the wire he is soon joined by number nine
the fence collapses
the dead things swarm into the depot
dead reckoning pulls out
rumbling over the section of fencing the zombies pushed down it drives into the night
soldiers abandon their stations and scatter shooting wildly
number nine knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat
the soldier falls losing his m
big daddy grabs the bat and throws it aside
picking up the soldiers m he presses the weapon into number nines hands even arranging number nines fingers on the trigger
with the gun aimed at the ground number nine fires a burst that sends her into a spastic dance
the soldier sits back up
draws a pistol
big daddy grabs the barrel of the still firing m and guides it along the pavement to
the soldiers legs
bullets march up his groin belly chest and finally head
another soldier attacks
this time number nine aims her weapon purposefully and scores a direct hit
other dead things smack at the steel doors that lead down to the subway
they cant get through
losing interest they drift slowly away until their attention is refocused by
a grunt from big daddy who is gazing toward the glow of the fiddlers green high rise across the river closer now than before
thats where he wants to be
thats where hes determined to go
kaufman rips a turkey leg off a cooked bird on a platter in front of him and eats
across the table sits one of his board members harrison sutherland
phone call sir
thank you knipp
ill take it
knipp brings a radio phone to the table
kaufman picks up the receiver and lifts it to his ear
kaufman tenses just enough for sutherland to notice
the one that got away
you said we should talk when i was less excited
im a lot less excited now
what do you want mister demora
i cant have a place in the green fine
ill go find another place
but you know what im gonna need
i want my money out of your bank
and i want the rest of the money out of your bank
and if you dont give it to me im gonna blow you out of your fuckin ivory tower
ive got dead reckoning
put the money on a boat and send it across the river to the south side
tenth street pier
one man to drive the boat no more
youve got till midnight
i wont be there
dead reckoning wont be there
but ill know if it happens
ill know if it doesnt happen
cholo hangs up
in a world where the dead are returning to life the word trouble loses much of its meaning
beat he wants money
we dont negotiate with terrorists
there are other options
a fiddlers green security guard opens a cell door
which one of you is denbo
riley charlie and slack exchange glances
kaufman sips a scotch
sutherland is present with a middle aged board member named chandler styles and cliff woods who is young and ambitious
all of them are nervous pacing
a door opens and riley is ushered into the room
can i offer you a drink
i dont drink
please sit down
nobody else is sitting
i think ill just stand here like the rest of you
while you tell me why im standing here
we need you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us
the vehicle you designed mister denbo
dead reckoning has been stolen
by your second in command
i want him captured
and i want my two million dollar piece of equipment returned
which has guns
that could do a great deal of damage if he were to aim them at this city
why dont you just send out your troops
i dont want to lose them
i could send five hundred men against that thing and theyd all come back in body bags
its your vehicle
cholo was your man
you might be able to get close enough to
do what has to be done
refilling his scotch do this for me and ill grant you something in return
residence in the green
thats what cholo wanted and you didnt give it to him did you
thats why hes out there waving a cannon at your ass
kaufman wont admit that rileys right but he looks at him with a glimmer of respect
give me one of those vehicles over in the depot weapons and enough ammunition to go north
theres nothing up north
thats the idea
youve named your price
an easy one to pay
one more thing
they go with me
e looks at riley a hint of desperation behind his eyes
an you find dead reckoning
i have a way
dead reckoning rumbles along a dark street plowing into a derelict car knocking it aside and rolling it down a small embankment pinning three dead things beneath
cholos team laughs raucously at the fate of the zombies
tense knock it off
big daddy steps out of the darkness watching the lights of dead reckoning recede
he hears desperate squealing coming from under the toppled car
he lumbers down the embankment
pushes on one of the upturned tires
he cant turn the car by himself
he looks back to the road
number nine and others of big daddys gathering force hurry to the car
the car rolls over freeing the three dead things
one of them used to be a butcher
still wearing a blood stained apron carrying a meat cleaver he looks at big daddy with something resembling gratitude
soldiers pass out monster weapons to riley charlie and slack
riley straps on a k
charlie turns one down
i like the iron i already got
this piece fires fourteen rounds a second
charlie unstraps his own remington
a la sergeant york he licks his thumb
wets the sight
and blasts a cockroach climbing on a wall twenty feet away
i dont normly need fourteen rounds
ill take that gun
can you handle it
the safetys off
he soldier checks the gun
the safety is off
he clicks it on and embarrassedly hands the weapon to slack
to slack and charlie you guys dont have to come out with me if you dont want to
slack ties her hair back with a bandana
checks her gun clip
id feel like a dick if i didnt
just look at me you can tell id feel like a dick
some shit aint it
goin out to save a place we dont give a fuck about
its not the place
its the people in it
kaufman and sutherland enter with several others
your friends are going out with you
i want some of my friends to go along as well
an hispanic man steps forward
thats how i am called
after the bullfighter
teahouse steps forward
a mean looking asian right out of mortal kombat
he joins his hands as if in prayer and bows
illsbury is a woman a sumo sized samoan six hundred pounds and seven feet tall swaggering decked out in a clatter of fighting gear
pillsbury speaks with a voice as deep as the mindanao trench
i come here to do sumthin
not stann aroun
why we stann aroun
less go do sumthin
a long dock juts into the river
dead reckoning stops beside it
mouse jumps out
cholo stands in an open hatch
looking around nervously dont leave me alone here long
give me a call
let e know if were rich or not
mouse nods running off to hide in a boat shed
the steel doors to the subway tunnel open
riley and his team step out
the depot has been devastated
only tony baloney moves still waving spookily
cholo made a mess
cholo didnt do all this
clouds of thick black smoke from the fires billow across the depot restricting visibility
ever shifting openings in the clouds reveal glimpses of torn body parts
stenches have been at this place
he leads the way into the depot his m at the ready
behind him all eyes peer nervously into the smoke
everyone speaks in hushed tones
when the truck pulled out it must have knocked the fence down
thats how they got in
that fencing was pushed in from outside
you know how many stenches it would take to do that
theres a thousand of them out there for every one of us
good thing were smarter
look whos talkin
theyre getting smart
i saw it in uniontown last time out
theyre learning how to work together
so does the smoke which billows thicker virtually blinding the team
the moaning of the wind
the popping of burnt metal and wood
what do they want
slack looks back as she walks
the zombies have taken down another section of the depot fence beyond which lies a suburb
beyond which is the river
beyond which is the glow of the fiddlers green high rise
they want the city
the city is us
theyre after us
we pissed em off one too many times
theyll never get across the river
gotta love the guy
he still believes in heaven
anyone got a radio
teahouse pulls a motorola from his belt
just as he tosses it to riley they hear
he team draws their weapons standing in a loose circle their backs to each other guns searching for a target
darting eyes peer into the void
more noises emanate from somewhere
charlie unstraps his remington
licks his thumb
wets the sight of the rifle
a whisper why do you do that
whispering back catches the light
right now its moonlight
lets me see where im aimin
a single shot into the black smoke
the hell you shooting at
dead man steps out of the smoke
before anyone can react it grabs slacks shoulder from behind
she whirls around
is about to shoot when she sees an entry wound on the left side of the things forehead
but i got him
the thing relaxes its grip and drops at slacks feet
hysterical theres more of em out there
i can hear em
there are shuffling sounds in the smoke
manolete backs away
pillsbury grabs him
slaps him hard across the face
if they is more we gonna need o guns
pull em out nstann up wid us like de man you aint
riley lifts teahouses motorola and pushes send
calling the green
lose on sutherlands alarmed face
a trooper equally alarmed is reporting
thats what he said
he said the depot was wiped out by stenches
keep us informed
riley and his team move through drifting smoke
vehicles are scattered about
they stop at the t bird
there are no keys in the ignition
gotta go get the keys riley
iley looks across the lot to the charred ruin of a shack
tire fires burn around it
aint no keys to get
hot wire the fucker
manolete climbs in and goes to work under the dash
e feelin better since i hit im
suddenly charlie draws his
and fires at slack
the bullet buzzes just above her ear blowing a wisp of hair as
a dead old man behind her drops a hole in its head
that was useful
the wind shifts and black smoke envelopes them
i cant see
riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash
he team fans out around the t bird
the smoke is so thick they cant make out anything
including each other
harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze
what he doesnt see what he cant see is whats behind him
a female walker wearing the soiled and tattered remnants of a bridal gown
the fabric seems to glow in the smoke
the bride shuffles toward charlie
we see it coming
no one else does
just as it opens its mouth to bite
her bullet cuts closer than the one charlie fired clipping off the top of his ear before even steven
i didnt hurt you
manolete fumbles with colored wires under the dash
impatient yellow to red
what the fuck does a samoan know about hot wiring cars
five thousand cars
every year in samoa
fifty thousand in mexico
mexico got a million cars
samoa got five thousand
riley leads the team into the t bird
manolete starts to get out from under the dash
as teahouse settles into a seat by the door
something heavy and wet smacks his shoulder
its a forearm
it drops onto teahouse as if thrown at him
oh god whats this
teahouse hurls the bloody thing onto the asphalt
shockingly the arm springs back thumping against teahouses face
a twist of torn muscle no thicker than clothesline is keeping the limb loosely attached to
a dead thing that has crawled beside the t bird
lifting itself it bites a large filet out of teahouses arm
charlie shoots it
anolete climbs up behind the wheel and
pedal to the metal he pulls out of the depot
slack glances at teahouse then wind in her hair leans in close to riley
softly how long does he have
i had a brother
real brother by birth
hung on for six days
before he turned
i was the one had to shoot him
and you said nothin bad ever happened to you
that happened to my brother
into his eyes but you kept going
got to right
dead is dead
and that aint you
and that aint me
slack turns to teahouse
i truly am
she draws her
aims at teahouse and fires
kaufman paces with a cigar passing sutherland styles and cliff
i recognize that some of you are concerned
weve been threatened by a disgruntled employee
ive sent people out to take care of the problem
however should something go wrong i want to assure you that measures have been taken
ive established outposts
with food and supplies to support us on our way
on our way
alternate sites have been chosen
air transport has been arranged
for us and our families
as well as necessary support personnel
what about all the others
kaufman looks at cliff as if expecting him to understand
all the others can be replaced
cliff let me talk to you for a moment
kaufman leads cliff into
an alcove on the far side of the room shutting two pocket doors made of sandblasted glass
sutherland and the others cant hear but can see kaufman and cliff in silhouette
on the other side of the doors kaufman leans close to cliff smiling his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly
you interrupted me
i was just talking about how people can be replaced
you dont want to be replaced do you
no and i dont want to replace you
you have promise
a day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities
right now the responsibilities are mine
all the responsibilities
it was my ingenuity that took an old world and made it into something new
i put up fences to make it safe
i hired soldiers and paid for their training
i keep the people on the streets away from us by giving them their games and vices
it costs me money
but i spend it because the responsibility is mine
now do you understand responsibility
kaufman looks disappointed
taking cliff by the arm smiling again he leads him over to an outer door and opens it
an armed security guard stands in the corridor outside
take him out with the rest of the garbage
i wont be needing this man anymore
at the conference table sutherland sees the light coming in from the outer corridor better defining the silhouettes as the security guard drags cliff away
to styles pretty soon its going to be one of us
n an overgrown suburban street a lawn tractor driven by a gardener in work clothes drives back and forth back and forth over a swath of dead grass
the gardener is dead too
cholo watches the gardener through the windshield
if i dont have this truck im no different to kaufman than that poor mexican bastard out there
hes never gonna pay
he knows its his ass if he doesnt
cholo slides open a small window grabs his crossbow and shoots the gardener in the head
angle on a solid wall of wood
big daddy number nine and others of the dead push against it
the wood holds
big daddy turns surveying his troops
focusing on the butcher
on the meat cleaver it has in its hand
big daddy pounds on the wood demonstrating
points at the meat cleaver
the butcher gets it
approaches the wall
the meat cleaver chops into wood splintering it
reverse angle from the other side of the wall as the wood splinters to reveal big daddys eyes staring through at
the fiddlers green high rise looming closer than it was before though its still across the river
close on a small electronic unit the size and appearance of a game boy
an led screen shows a blinking red dot moving along a map
turn left up here
slack driving the t bird now makes the turn
the car blows through a deserted town moving fast
riley notices that slack is effected by the desolation she sees
how long since you been out here
never been out
lived in the city since
it was a regular city
you said you were going to make yourself useful
right now what i could use is for you to pull over
the t bird stops along a road bordered by a marsh thick with tall cat tails
unexpectedly riley stands and points his automatic at pillsbury and manolete
i made a deal with your boss
im gonna do it
keep him from blowing up the green
im gonna do it i dont want people to get hurt
bring back dead reckoning
thats where i stop
i didnt ask him for much just guns ammo and a car
ive got the guns
ive got the ammo
and if i find dead reckoning im gonna have the best fucking car thats ever been built and im taking it to canada
if any of you dont like that idea
riley reaches down and opens the passenger door
manolete looks out and sees the cat tails moving
three walkers are slogging through the marsh
i like see canada
pillsbury reaches out and slams the car door closed again
charlie keep these two covered
charlie pulls his
riley turns around his seat glancing down again at the game boy in his palm
the red dot has moved on to another map
take a right onto route six
slack pulls out
this is what you were thinking about all along
you got me out here figuring im a boy scout and now youre telling me were just stealing a fucking car
you have a problem with that
i like the way you think
i like the way he thinks too
just look at me you can tell i like the way he thinks
take another right
how do you know which way youre going
riley holds up the game boy
it beeps softly as the red dot shifts onto another map
i built a homing device into dead reckoning
if cholos anywhere within fifty miles we can track him
dead reckoning stops on a long road at the end of which stands
a military complex
the beam of a searchlight sweeps back and forth over the buildings a sign of life
cholo checks his watch
he speaks into a transmitter
mouse stands in the shed holding a transmitter of his own
im telling you hes never gonna pay
thats why were here
cholo looks out the window to the searchlight sweeping over the military complex in the distance
slack drives as riley monitors his game boy
hes going to ross park
where they keep the big boomers
for dead reckonings cannons
mouse looks at a grimy window as the shadow of a walker stops just beyond the glass
mouse fires a burst shattering the window and dropping the walker
mouse takes a tentative step toward the window
a scratching sound
something climbs up onto the sill from outside
mouse raises his gun but hesitates when he sees
its a child
a girl scout
it died at age nine still wearing its uniform
now its voracious
it grabs mouses gun hand
the weapon fires harmlessly into the floor
mouse is about to be chomped when
a stalagmite of glass in the top of the shattered window drops piercing the girl scouts head
mouse runs screaming to the door where he is grabbed by another dead thing
as he is torn apart he sees that there are dozens more
close on big daddy
only the river now flows between he and his goal fiddlers green high rise so near and yet so far
the door slams behind kaufman as he enters the foyer
knipp emerges from the rear
any word from mister denbo sir
pack us up
we might have to be leaving
in the helicopters
well only need one of them
pretty boy eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of buildings ross park a sprawling munitions depot
the searchlight continues to sweep across the night but no one is manning it
its mounted to an automatic rotator on the roof of the main building
looks like no ones here
the gates stand wide open
theres no sign of life
cholo punches a button
the side hatch hisses open
get out there and see what the fuck
foxy moves out through the open hatch
somebody go out and help
scar grabs his weapons
one of the dead topples face first into the water dropping out of sight
big daddy looks at the spot where his brothers fell in
he looks for a long time cocking his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind
the first dead thing slowly rises out of the water
then the second
they stand waist deep in the shallows
big daddy gazes down at the water a concept dawning
then with grim purpose he steps deliberately off the low wall
hitting the river he manages to stay on his feet
standing waist deep with the others he scoops up water with his one good hand
he looks up
sees the city lights reflected on the river
he tries to express his thoughts
all that comes from his mouth is a series of inarticulate moans
hes incapable of transmitting his idea
so he does what hes been doing since uniontown
he walks toward the city
out of the shallows
into deep water
over his head
there are automobile tires garbage cans a rusted anchor a sunken motor boat hundreds of beer bottles
and thousands of dead things
on the river bottom
following big daddy through the debris
a knock on a door is answered by a man who looks a bit too greasy to be important
sutherland is outside
how much is kaufman paying you and your men
four hundred a day
ill pay you five thousand a day
the car speeds down the road with slack at the wheel
riley looks at his watch
the unmanned searchlight scans the yard casting intermittent shadows
this place is important
the men here wouldnt just walk out
maybe they had no choice
foxy and scar move toward a large storage building where a door swings in the night breeze slapping alarmingly against the wall
beyond the opening is a black maw like a velvet curtain past which nothing can be seen
there could be stenches in there
readying his m got a flashlight
scar nervously pulls out a flashlight
as he clicks on the beam he loses his grip
the flashlight drops to the ground
scar reaches for it
his fingers tip it and it spins
the beam washes across his shoes
then foxys shoes
one other shoe
gasping scar grabs the flashlight shining the beam up onto what should be a leg but theres nothing left above its bloody shin
beads of blood hit the floor dropping from the dark figure of a soldier who is approaching
scar aims the flashlight at the figures face recognizing
wheres the other guys
what happened here
brubaker keeps coming
he has bullet holes in his chest but theyre not whats dripping blood
its another half eaten foot that hes carrying
brubaker is dead
foxy shoots him
foxy and scar move into a hangar like space
except for the mote filled beam from scars flashlight which illuminates a supply of enormous cannon shells lined up on storage shelves
six dead soldiers are hunkered in the shadows eating the remains of other dead soldiers
foxy grimly raises his weapon
as he squeezes the trigger the sound of the gunfire overlaps into
anchor and scar wrestle two johnsons into place
thats all we need
sober to blow up the green
the t bird rumbles along a road lined with large homes once prized for their panoramic views
rileys game boy beeps
the display shows the red dot moving along a map
cholos moving out
looks like hes heading right for us
riley looks outside
beyond the homes he can see the city
off this hillside
they can shell the green
slack pulls into a driveway stopping the t bird in the shadow of one of the houses
heyll be coming up this road
in a walk in steel walled safe kaufman pulls out banded stacks of money and stuffs them into two prada duffels
one head rises out of the river
its big daddy rivulets of water running down the creases of his face
another head rises
number nine and the butcher zombie
more and more heads break the surface
the water fills with bodies emerging from the deep
hundreds of them
the city lights reflect off their wet clothes as the army of the dead clambers up a boat ramp on the city side of the river
riley and his team wait in the shadows of the driveway they pulled into
they hear the distant growl of dead reckoning
looking over a hedge row riley can see high beams advancing
to the others yall stay here
youre goin out there alone
you need our guns
dead reckonings got steel skin an inch thick
you cant shoot your way in
im hopin i can talk my way in
hes gonna steal the truck and leave us here
rileyd never do that
just look at him you can tell hed never do that
keep an eye on the hatches
if i get in ill try to leave one open
riley takes off
charlie looks torn
he wants to go with riley but he has to keep pillsbury and manolete covered
i like dat man
you go help im
i take care of dis sissy
pillsbury moving fast for a big woman pounds manoletes temple with a mighty fist
he drops like a lead weight
the door to the roof opens and the greasy man from downtown steps out of a fire stair with another greasy man
sutherland remains inside the door
i dont know about this
leavin people behind
kaufman was gonna leave people behind
so were leaving him
the greasy men go trotting across the rooftop
as they climb into two helicopters we realize that they are pilots
riley walks down the road
the growling of the diesels is getting louder the glow from the high beams brighter
riley is startled by a noise behind him
he whirls around and sees charlie approaching
everythings cool back there
riley is about to object when dead reckoning comes rumbling around a corner a hundred yards down the street
riley checks his watch again
too late to send me back
put on your sunday smile
try to look friendly
i am friendly
just look at me you can tell im friendly
in the cab pretty boy eases off the gas
cholo looks out the windshield as the headlights strike
and his idiot
gimme the mike
the vehicle crunches to a stop forty yards away
pretty boy hands cholo a microphone
cholo speaks into it
howd you get up here riley
grabbed the t bird
what are you doin up here
riley holds up his game boy
cholo looks surprised
trucks got a little transmitter in her belly
sorry i never told you
you were always a smart guy riley
much smartern me
you went and took off without inviting us along
you werent around to get invited
anyway i figured you wouldnt want in on this
we want in on anything you got goin
to pretty boy open up
whatre you nuts
slack and pillsbury watch from the shadows as a hatch opens
riley and charlie step on board
pretty boy is at the controls
foxy anchor and scar stand nearby
charlie is grinning like a badly scarred cheshire cat
the hell you so happy about
riley told me to smile
sos youd let us come in
id rather have you in here than out there
cholo lifts his crossbow pressing a loaded arrow up under rileys chin
whos the smart one now
charlie is about to react when he feels foxys m poking into his back
cholo looks into rileys eyes
thought you were gonna quit
here you are still working for the man
kaufman sent you out here didnt he
to get the truck back
slack and pillsbury creep forward freezing as they see riley with the crossbow at his neck
slack aims her k at cholo rustling branches as she moves
that man pulls the trigger hes dead
cholo cocks his head outside
who else is out there
kaufman sent some guys with us
we took care of em
i know you been up to ross park
picked up some johnsons huh
pretty boy set the cannons
with great whirring sounds the vehicles largest guns begin to rotate slowly toward the city across the river
were running out of time here
make yourself useful
manolete begins to stir on the ground beside the t bird
riley keeps cool
dont do it cholo
kaufmans got it coming
slack and pillsbury watch the gun turret continue to turn the cannon barrels angling toward fiddlers green
pretty boy lifts a clear cover off a red firing button
hit the tower square youll kill a lot of innocent people
miss and hit the city youll kill a lot of our friends
your beefs with kaufman not them
the turret on the roof groans as the cannons rotate
hes killed a lot of our friends
every week we took out the garbage you and me
every month i took out kaufmans garbage
people he wanted off the streets
he turned me into a goon and then he pissed all over me
foxy keep em covered
the turret stops cannons aimed directly at the green
cholo moves to the red firing button
when the smoke clears im gonna roll in hit the bank take the money and pick up any other fancy shit i can get my hands on
there wont be any fancy shit left
and money burns
not when you keep it in a safe
manolete pulls one of the machine guns out of its mount on the t bird
shouldering it he creeps toward dead reckoning
cholo reaches down and pushes the button
the gun barrels are cold
cholo punches the button again
cholos eyes fall to the game boy in rileys hand
you did something didnt you
with your fucking toy
riley pushes another button on the game boy
two steel locking rings swing up to cap the cannons
just beyond the barrels we see manolete closing in on dead reckoning raising his machine gun
a dead thing advances behind him
cholo charges riley
grabs him around the throat
not a chance
riley tosses the game boy out the open hatch
cholo reaches out after it
manolete has the machine gun aimed at dead reckonings open hatch
where cholo is standing
out of the corner of his eye riley sees manoletes machine gun barrel flash in the moonlight
riley pushes cholo out of the way just in time
he drops from the hatch onto the pavement wounded in the shoulder
the walker starts to rip manolete apart
slack shoots him in the head
then she and pillsbury open fire on the walker destroying it
foxy distracted by the mayhem lets charlie get the drop on him
anchor and scar go for their guns
riley unslings his m and holds them at bay
riley looks at the clock on the control panel
charlie follows his gaze
we just made it
riley clicks the transmitter on
riley denbo calling the green
kaufman steps off the elevator carrying his two prada bags full of money
a two way radio in his pocket rings
into radio urgent yes
we got cholo
sagging with relief i owe you mister denbo
im glad you feel that way
because im taking your fucking truck
kaufman rushes in with his bags dropping them beside other luggage that is already packed
frightened mister kaufman sir
i dunno whats happening sir but it sounds bad
the windows are sealed so the noise kaufman hears is muffled but it is definitely the sound of disorder
he goes to a window
looks down and sees
flashes of light from gunfire
smoke rising from an explosion
the dead swarming into the city like ants
a war has begun
sutherland stands at the edge of the roof looking down at what kaufman just saw
all this time kaufmans been worried about a revolution on the streets
he never thought it would come from across the river
sutherland styles other board members and their families get into the two helicopters
the sound of rumbling
the ceiling vibrates knocking tear shaped baubles off a chandelier
the sound builds in intensity
then suddenly eases off
through the window kaufman sees the things that caused the rumbling
two helicopters soaring off into the night
they cant leave
not without me
i think they just did sir
riley jumps out onto the street where cholo lies bleeding from the top of his left shoulder
i hate you riley
theres something about you ive always fucking hated
smiling same here
look out there
riley looks where slack is pointing
from across the river comes a flickering orange glow
riley moves to a spot where he can see between the houses on the hillside
in the distance fire rises from the city
cholo sits up cackling
i didnt have to blow the fucking place up
somebody else did for me
stunned the stenches
they got across the river
they got across the fucking river
to the others get him inside
pillsbury steps in and lifts cholo easily to his feet
wait wait wait
what are we doin
where we goin
back to the city
not this horse
you got the t bird
ill take that
foxy jumps out of dead reckoning and stands at cholos side
riley slack and pillsbury climb aboard
riley looks down at cholo and foxy
you guysd be safer coming with us
nah youd never let me have any fun
t birds down that driveway over there
guns and ammo inside
riley closes the hatch
blood trickles from under his chin where cholo stuck him with the crossbow
slack reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back her hair which cascades down
she uses the fabric to clean the blood off rileys neck
he looks at her touched by the familiarity of the gesture
almost lost you there
i dont get lost so easy
to pretty boy we gotta get across the water
the bridges into the city are all bricked up
pretty boy hits a button
a map appears on a monitor showing the golden triangle bordered by the rivers and the barricaded bridges spanning them
we could blast our way through
dont want to
if the stenches got in theres a war going on in the city
we take any of those bridges well end up right in the middle of it
riley runs his finger along the monitor outlining the natural and man made barriers that protect the triangle
weve gotta come in above the throat
his finger continues down the monitor to the throat at the base of the triangle where the long fence runs between the two rivers
what was built to keep folks safe is gonna trap them inside
weve gotta give them a way out
close on kaufman staring out his penthouse window aghast
licks of fire reflect on the glass
sounds of war can be heard from far below
in the pristine plaza that surrounds the building walkers swarm
citizens run screaming including soldiers driven from their posts who shoot at the dead things
close on big daddy
who looks back and forth as if torn at the fiddlers green high rise at the violence in the streets back at the building back at the streets
a soldier fires at him
big daddy raises his rifle and blows him away
cholo and foxy run up the road to the t bird
seeing a walker lurking ahead they duck into the dark cover of the trees
i got it
cholo picks off the walker with his crossbow
come on lets go
he slaps a hand on foxys back
xcept its not foxy
its another walker that has moved between the two men
it grabs the hand that slapped him and bites it
foxy a few yards away whirls aiming his gun at the walker
cholo is faster
with no time to reload in agony he pulls a fistful of arrows from his quiver and drives them through the walkers face and skull
the walker falls
so does an ominous silence
i cant fucking believe it
a sad chuckle nothin works out
the world is spinning around and were just
caught in the wind
nothin works out
some damn thing always comes around the corner and gets you
foxy aims his rifle fat cholos forehead
their eyes connect
for a moment cholo looks despondent
then he forces a smile
no dont shoot
a dark chuckle always wanted to see how the other half lives
foxy lowers his gun
take the car and get outa here
ill get outa here
you take the car
ead reckoning drives upriver
through the windshield the city can be seen burning in the distance
the old j lll take us over
right outside the throat
a drawbridge spans the river
or would span it if it wasnt open its rusted metal roadbed rising into the sky
gotta get it down
the controls are in that booth up there
a control booth is built into the superstructure of the bridge about fifteen feet off the ground on dead reckonings side of the river
riley jumps out of dead reckoning
slack is right behind him
get back in there
what are you doing
she shoots a walker that has come out of the night
making myself useful
cholo jumps out of the t bird and runs to the steel doors unlocking them with a mag key
cholo walks with determination along the deserted tracks under the river
riley ducks under a caution gate at the entrance to the bridge and starts across the roadway
slack and charlie stand weapons ready eyes alert for danger
as riley runs
something skitters across the road chasing him
not a zombie
a river rat
charlie draws his remington
wets the sight with his thumb
riley stops running
looks back to see whats being shot
i blew its ass off
the rat is now half a rat
its ass has been blown off
yet just didnt hit it in the head
they all are
zombie rats crawl up onto the roadbed
riley takes off away from them
slack and charlie hurry closer firing trying to pick the critters off
the rats reach riley
nip at his heels
swings onto a girder
climbs to the control booth
the rats dont follow
slack heaves a sigh of relief just before
a second pack of rats scurries toward her
she vaults over a railing dropping several feet to
the riverbank below
but there are rats here too
charlie fires at them from above
fur and blood fly
but there are too many
he cant shoot them all
riley reaches the control booth
expecting danger within
he steps through the opening
but nothings there
just a spider web that sweeps over his face as he moves toward a red switch that activates a generator
he flips it
the motor roars to life
he turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed
it groans from disuse as he pulls it
red lights on the caution gates blink tinting the night
the silence is shattered by a loud siren that echoes across the river
the bridges roadbed begins to creak down slowly
three dinghies lie upside down next to the waters edge
slack shoves one into the river climbing onto its upturned bottom
she pushes off
the boat doesnt budge
a tether holds it within inches of the shore
slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope but
rats snap at her hands
slack recoils but keeps cutting
finally the rope frays enough for the boat to pull free
slack crouches on top of the upturned hull
no way to steer
the current carrying her away
hearing the scream riley looks out the control booth window and sees
slack being taken downstream
riley bursts out of the booth only to be confronted by
it grabs riley pushing his head back toward the enormous gearworks of the bridge
bests the creature
spins him around toward the gearworks and
the bridgekeepers head is scissored off
it drops with a plunk into the river below
slack adrift on the boat lies prone at the bow and begins to paddle with her hands
one of which hits something long and slimy
it looks like a snake
but its not
its only a moss covered rope
slack grabs on
pulls hand over hand
it seems to take forever for the rope to become taut
its the bridgekeepers head its eyes blinking as it floats off on the current
he rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore
slacks muscles strain as she pulls on it until
her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off finding herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used
the river has carried her into the very part of the city riley and the team were trying to avoid
screams rise nearby
shes in the war zone
the bridge is lowering slowly
riley scrambles up the incline of the roadbed and calls back to charlie
bring her over as soon as you can
charlie pops back into dead reckoning
riley climbs to the top of the descending roadbed and
leaps across the narrowing gulf to the other side
gets to his feet and runs toward slack and the city
slack runs past hysterical people toward the fiddlers green high rise
brian mulligans young son rushes by her in a panic
slack grabs him
we cant get out
theres no way out
there will be
come with me
daddys still locked up
slack runs off with brian past a manhole surrounded by canvas fences caution signs and flaming oil pots
as maintenance workers scramble out of the manhole
dead things close in
the workers unarmed pick up the ball shaped pots and bowl them at the walkers
as the balls roll their fires swirl making them look like flaming comets
ome of the pots crack open creating pools of fire on the street
one of the balls remains whole until it smacks against the feet of a walker
then it opens
and the walker is engulfed in flames
big daddy looks at the walker with sadness
he lifts his rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head
big daddy walks to the manhole
tools are strewn around it pickaxes sledges chainsaws and a pneumatic hammer which is lying on the street
big daddy looks at the fiddlers green skyscraper
finally in reach
he looks down at the pneumatic hammer and picks it up by the handle
with the heavy tool vibrating in its hand big daddy walks toward the building
he doesnt get very far before the hammers electrical cord is pulled out of the extension its plugged into
the hammer stops running
big daddy looks at it
puzzles over its stillness for a moment
he looks at the building
at its doors abandoned by guards
doors that are made of glass
the barrel of an m is planted against big daddys temple by a militiaman
udda budda budda
the militiaman flies back
it wasnt he who fired
it was number nine standing nearby with her m
the militiaman lies on the ground his dead eyes staring at number nine in utter surprise
seeing what has happened another soldier grabs a grenade pulls the pin and is about to toss it at big daddy when
his hand is cut off at the wrist by a meat clever held by the butcher
the soldiers hand still clutching the grenade plops into the street
the soldier looks down in horror then collapses on top of his hand
a muffled explosion makes jelly of his mid section
big daddy continues to walk toward the building carrying the pneumatic hammer as other dead things collect sledges pickaxes lengths of pipe and follow their leader
kaufman and knipp carrying the prada duffles rush out of an elevator with four security guards
kaufman carries a gun
hey race into the street level of the three story atrium
chopin lilts caged birds sing
residents scream running crazily in all directions
a bank of glass doors leading to the street is under assault by walkers ten deep
they cant get in
the dead things pound at the doors
one guard runs away
the other three follow
et back here
get back here
kaufman fires three rounds at the men
hes not a marksman but one of the guards is winged
whirls around and levels his m at kaufman
hes about to fire when knipp steps in front of kaufman
grabbing kaufmans gun hand boss
dont you shoot neither
were all on the same side
least were supposed to be
im on my own side now
the guard takes off after his comrades
need some help mister k
kaufman spins around to see cholo walking toward him across the atrium
been bit mister k
im a dead man so i dont care about nothin no more
still care about you though
i wanna make sure you come to the same end as me
the dead things at the glass doors are pounding now with shovels pickaxes and lengths of pipe
heyre going to get you mister k
want them to get you
kaufman raises his gun and aims at cholo who aims back with his crossbow
ut it down old man unless youd rather die right now
big daddy appears outside the doors
uses his pneumatic hammer to pound at the safety glass
aufman cant take it anymore
he bolts for a stairway door
an arrows hits kaufman in the back of his left calf
kaufman sprawls dropping both his bag of money and his gun which skitters kaway
knipp rushes over to help kaufman
just let us go mister demora
let us get out of here
calmly reloading you can go knipp but not him
kaufman shakes knipp off
his gun is ten feet away
he heads for it
dragging himself on hands and knees
the chisel on big daddys pneumatic hammer is the first tool to penetrate the doors
the glass doesnt shatter it cobwebs into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin plasticine coating
alarm bells sound
puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into something that looks different big daddy drops the pneumatic hammer and reaches out
the glass is different
big daddy pokes his hand right through
kaufman has almost reached his gun
cholo shoots another arrow
this one hits kaufman in the shoulder
you fucking spic bastard
i think we should talk when youre a little less excited
kaufman has a will of iron
he keeps going gritting his teeth against the pain reaching out for his gun as
more tools penetrate the doors
more hands poke through
aufman looks at his worst nightmare
dead things ripping their way through the cobwebbed doors invading his temple
the commotion distracts cholo just long enough for kaufman to lift his gun and fire nine rounds
ost of the shots miss
two hit cholo one in the belly one in the heart
he is slammed against the wall his glazing eyes staring up into the atrium the place he so desired
its the last thing he sees before he keels over dead
knipp pulls kaufman onto his feet
they look up to see
big daddy leading his army into the atrium
kaufman aims and fires
a bullet hits big daddy in the upper chest blowing dead flesh out of his back
the dead man feels no pain but it focuses on kaufman and starts after him with purpose
kaufman sees something in big daddys eyes
something thats not dead
kaufman fires again
hes out of ammo
we gotta get outa here
knipp pulls kaufman to a stairway door
they rush inside
the moment theyre out of sight the walkers forget about them moving on into the atrium
all except big daddy
that rage is still in its face as he lumbers toward the stairway door
the roadbed of the drawbridge drops into place
dead reckoning rumbles across the span
keys turn in the locks of cell doors which slack and brian pull open
mulligan and his revolutionaries emerge
mulligan embraces his son and looks gratefully at slack
to his men lets go get our guns boys
iley runs out of a line of trees
in the distance he sees
the throat where much of the citys population is trapped herded by hundreds of walking dead against the layers of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them
theres no escape
people are being torn apart and eaten
the fencing sparks as bodies touch it and are electrocuted
terrible screams fill the air
riley hears the distinctive roar of dead reckonings engines the clatter of its treads
he moves toward the sound as
a dead thing looms three feet away
riley lifts his pistol and puts a shell through the things skull
blood flies taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is backlit by
the glare of dead reckonings approaching headlights
the dead thing falls to the road where
it is turned to apple butter by dead reckonings enormous treads
riley stands right in the vehicles path
et outa the way riley
through the windshield riley looms larger and larger as the vehicle closes in
he doesnt move
pretty boy tries to turn the wheel
pure anguish riley
three seconds later rileys figure comes scrambling across the windshield climbing up toward
the two fourteen inch cannons on the vehicles turrets
we gotta blow the fences
johnsons are loaded
yeah but theyre capped
the barrels of the two fourteen inchers are still capped
dead reckoning keeps rolling
riley climbs out onto one of the cannon barrels
a walker grabs him by the leg from the road
riley blasts him with his
as other walkers approach he shoots them with one hand rusing the other to uncap the cannon
number one is clear
im going for number two
i dont normlly need two shots riley
the road is now filled with walkers
tanding astride the vehicle riding it as if it were a living beast riley picks some of them of with his
footsteps echo as knipp carrying one of the prada duffles helps the wounded kaufman across an underground parking garage a dark and spooky place made more so by the sounds
of distant screaming
kaufman disdainfully snaps off the shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder
the two men reach a stretch lincoln
knipp beeps the doors open and they get inside knipp behind the wheel kaufman in the luxurious back compartment where he pours himself a scotch from the built in bar
knipp starts the engine
the sound echoes big time in the concrete tomb
looking at the fuel gauge we eed gas
knipp steers the car slowly carefully through the shadows pulling in beside a gasoline pump near the base of a ramp that leads up to the street
knipp pushes a button that pops open the gas tank
he shuts the engine off and gets out taking the keys which have a mag card attached to them
e slides the mag card into a slot activating the pump
an led scrolls thank you mr
knipp pulls the nozzle
freezes when he hears
a dark figure is approaching through the shadows
nipp drops the nozzle
ducks into the car
slams the door
a single hand smacks against the driver side window
a face leans in behind the hand
a face full of rage
big shoot it
shoot the damn thing
you didnt gimme no gun sir
big daddy moves to one of the rear windows
he cant see inside
the window is tinted
he returns to the clear windshield looks back at an angle and sees kaufman in the rear compartment
big daddy recognizes him
its the man who shot him
the dead thing looks up
sees the gasoline pump
his hand drops to the embroidery on its jump suit
he moves deliberately toward the pump
keys are in the pump
big daddy sees the nozzle on the cement
picks it up feeling the familiarity of it
pulls the trigger
the rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction
using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer big daddy pounds on the windshield three times before the safety glass cobwebs
he pokes the nozzle through the flexible fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks
gasoline floods into the car
big daddy pulls the driver side door open
as knipp tries to run he is grabbed by big daddy
big daddy looks at the butler
then flings him aside
knipp is not his prey
with a glance at kaufman cowering in the back seat big daddy slams the car door and surprisingly walks away
up the ramp toward the street
the nozzle remains stuck in the fabric of the windshield
gasoline continues to flow into the car
kaufman crawls into the front seat wincing from his wounds and kicks the nozzle out of the window with his good leg getting soaked with gas in the process
he opens the door
limps to the pump
grabs the keys
as he starts back toward the car
something is standing right in front of him
its one of the walking dead
aufman shakes his head in disbelief
n no y youre dead
realization dawning oh my god
the cholo thing reaches for kaufman vengeance in its eyes
aufman breaks for the drivers door
he never makes it
the cholo thing grabs him and slams him down across the hood
leans over him
opens a drooling mouth
rrrumble umble umble
the sound of a bowling ball
kaufman looks up
its not a bowling ball
its an oil pot rolled down the ramp by big daddy
the fire ball approaches the gas soaked lincoln the gas soaked kaufman and
kaufman and the cholo thing are immolated
the fireball removes everything from sight except a few floating hundred dollar bills burning in mid air
hrough licks of flame we see
big daddy is almost smiling
dead reckoning approaches the electrified fences from beyond
were gonna blow the fences
the crowd screams and starts to clear the area
charlie works a joystick
the cannon turret grinds above
he takes aim at an area of the fences that is rapidly emptying of people
the fourteen incher turns toward the fences
riley rides it
kay but you best get off the gun
riley leaps down
the instant hes clear
the electrified fences are blown apart
n the dissipating smoke riley is the first one through the opening
within seconds citizens start toward it heading the other way
riley finds himself running against the tide
behind the surging crowd
walkers appear grabbing people
dropping them to the ground
iley fires in all directions
walkers drop around him
he saves a woman with a baby
a young couple
he runs out of ammo
walkers close in
the situation seems hopeless until
charlie hits a button on the console
fireworks bloom in the sky
he dead things gaze upward mesmerized
riley finds himself standing in the midst of fifty walkers frozen like statues around him
other than the intermittent boom of the fireworks silence
out of which
a whisper riley
slack emerges from behind one of the immobile dead things
riley moves toward her
she to him
both of them weaving a cautious path between the statues
they reach each other and embrace surrounded by dead things that dont even know they are there
gunfire explodes around them
hapless dead things are mowed down the way they were back in uniontown
this time by
mulligan and his revolutionaries
who slaughter every zombie in the area
brian is shooting too raring to go
when its all over
we could still use you riley
riley looks out at the city where there is still scattered distant gunfire
he looks at brian standing at mulligans side his innocent face speckled with the blood of the dead
riley shakes his head
its all yours mulligan
a zombie looks up toward the blooms
a strong hand grabs the collar of its shirt pulls its gaze away from the sky and herds it onward
the hand is big daddys
he herds others along too
a small group of two dozen including number nine and the butcher
one of the gattling guns ratchets into position taking aim at big daddy
pretty boy sits at the controls about to push the firing button when
riley grabs her hand
riley picks up a pair of binoculars and looks through the windshield at big daddy
through the binoculars big daddy looks at dead reckoning
for an instant his eyes meet rileys as they did in uniontown
riley lowers the binoculars
all they want is somewhere to go
same as us
big daddy leads his band into the future
dead reckoning rolls into the future too but in a different direction
thats where were goin aint it riley
if no one has any objections
anchor scar and pillsbury all shrug
riley looks at slack
no well take you along with us
ill try to make myself useful
to pretty boy take us north
dead reckoning growls off into the early dawn a lethal weapon
shooting off fireworks worthy of independence day
