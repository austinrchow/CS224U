final draft screenplay by carl gottlieb based on a story by howard sackler dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface
a dim shape massive threatening swims towards us from the distance
then it divides what was one is two and the shape becomes reality two divers in scuba gear swimming side by side
they are wearing minimal rubber considering the cool new england waters farmer john wetsuits with cut off legs assorted sport diving paraphernalia including an expensive camera with a flash attachment
one motions down there the other signals ok i see it and they dive deeper into darker waters where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths broken up by
seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral like columns of illumination
the wreck of the working fishermans boat orca formerly under the command of the late captain quint deceased these four years
buried in the sand near it still connected by rusting strands of cable the mangled remains of a shark cage glimmering with stainless steel highlights
a fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard a battered barrel similarly tangled
the divers bert and ernie appear
theyre fascinated by the find and bert with the camera snaps a few flash shots
the rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera
distant flashes obscured by vegetation in the foreground
ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin doors open and shut moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage
an occasional flash
lights up the bottom as bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark
ernie floats up out of a hatch sees the camera and strikes a pose clowning for the photographers benefit
a big hand f
motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait
now he floats in front of us gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability
then a large dim movement in the b
somethings out there moving towards us
its bigger bearing down like a train in a tunnel
its on us
the camera floats gently down and settles in the sand
a dark red mist eddies by
a last weak flash
an expensive cabin cruiser the diver working flag fluttering limply in the breeze is riding alone at anchor
a distant lighthouse beacon winks at us
the boat rocks in the ceaseless swell
on the stern elizabeth t
a long way from home
a blue and white police jeep is bouncing over the sand
a figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission
its martin brody chief of police on amity
the jeep slows to a stop and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time
a classical trumpet solo is playing in the background
brody charges through a door then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior the holidome a three story extravaganza of a motel where some sort of formal
ceremony is already in progress
a banner announces grand opening ball amity scholarship fund benefit
brody crosses under a high school band arranged dance band style on a balcony the trumpet player polo is finishing his solo the assembled crowd applauds politely
brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais as the presiding authority amity mayor larry vaughn begins speaking
thank you paul lohman for that eloquent solo
now for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort hotel complex a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call amity
seated on folding chairs wearing their good suits several of amitys selectmen real estate developer len peterson and ellen brody very chic
brody slips into the vacant chair next to her
the following is conducted in urgent whispers sotto voce while vaughn drones on
where the hell were you
i can see that

hendricks over there
he indicates his deputy still has the keys to the jeep in his pocket and i couldnt find the spares

but today the sun is rising on a new amity a new island filled with promise
applause len petersons amity shores development is an exciting addition to our island
the holiday inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family
amity means friendship and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony
applause brody settles into polite attentiveness acknowledging a wave from hendricks a politely bland young town cop in his idea of civilian finery
hendricks is fussing with the banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit
and now tina wilcox this years miss amity will cut the ribbon that officially opens this luxurious new hotel
tina the girl in the bathing suit escapes hendricks attentions and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon while phil fogarty the local photographer snaps away
tina was selected from more than of this islands lovely young ladies in the miss amity competition held every spring and shell represent amity island in the miss massachusetts competition

when she cuts this ribbon she will be opening our island to growth to development to planned expansion with full employment for our thriving community

she nods happily they whisper together while we martin and ellen have been joined by their youngest son sean

applause from the crowd len takes a bow
prompting go ahead tina
as she reaches out with the scissors
something catches her eye and she winks at her boyfriend ed marchand smirking in the crowd
he winks back and makes cut it motions with his fingers
tina cuts the ribbon and tom andrews a local diver pushes a decorated float out into the pool sparklers sputter balloons drop from the ceiling
thanks to tom andrews of amity aqua sports for contributing the special decorations
and now the amity high school band

the band swings into downtown and the crowd gets up to dance to eat and to break into small groups to talk
ellen is dragging brody over to where len peterson and larry vaughn the mayor are in conversation

to brody fantastic lady

sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad
mike dancing with marge waves good bye
the brodys start to leave passing a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it
they exchange a look nod agreement and brody boosts the bottle sneaking it out of the building while ellen giggles
brody and ellen are snuggling under the covers while early morning light streams under the blinds
its the morning after and the clothes from the night before are scattered all over the room
brody rolls against ellen spoon fashion morning horny
they start to move a little then turn face to face
outside their door the sounds of little feet sean padding downstairs
their bodies move under the blankets
theres a crash from the kitchen
they stop for a beat
as they resume little feet return
the milk fell out of the frigerator
whispering put a towel down
and shh daddys sleeping
his feet paddle off
brody and ellen start to slide together passion resumes
bigger feet go downstairs michaels up
the brodys kiss trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between brothers over whos responsible for spilled milk
then the sound of a car pulling into the driveway and a horn beep
they try to kiss again theres a door slam downstairs and talk between the boys and mrs
the brodys look at each other and break up laughing at the morning and themselves
as ellen and brody with the practice of years of marriage swing back to back and put their feet on the floor each on their side of the bed still
chuckling up for the day
need a ride
as far as the office
the police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets brody behind the wheel ellen and sean passengers
it slows near the foot of the street dockside where a real estate office marked amity shores development leonard peterson pres

marge in her lightening sailing close to ed and tina in tinas joy
silent green blue depths
a diver crosby working the bottom running a search pattern
another diver tom andrews running close
they signal to each other and make another pass
follow tom andrews as he skims the bottom near the wreck of the orca half buried in the silt
a divers line runs up and bobbing on the surface are three boats the amity police launch the deserted elizabeth t
from newport flying a divers flag and the scubavue a local diveboat operated by tom andrews and his partner crosby it has amity aqua sports lettered on it somewhere
hendricks and red are on the deck of the police boat peering at the cruiser
rich or poor its nice to have money
figure they split
happens every season someone takes off
once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting
a sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them its andrews surfacing holding up the underwater flash camera
this is all there is
crosby pops up next to him shows empty hands
if thats it thats it
the divers head for their boat hendricks fires up his engine and we brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man
i cant watch the news i cant watch a ball game i cant watch movies all i hear is that rotten kid with his rotten radio
ill do what i can but youre talking about a federal jurisdiction
leaving in a huff so call the fbi
black two sugars
what else is out there
one petty theft one domestic disturbance and an exhibitionist
ill take the exhibitionist you handle the others
i want you to do something about my first husband
brody is caught in the open
martin you have got to demand that grace kinney keep her shades down
what about enforcing the no parking ordinance on beach road
in a minute in a minute talk to mrs
continuing albert keeps coming around when im with gentlemen friends and he throws mud on their cars
eager to be heard every time theres an out of state car in my driveway i lose another mailbox
those little iron sailboats cost thirty two dollars each
to white haired man talk to me about mrs
her bedroom window faces my oldest boys bedroom and shes teasing him dancing around in a towel or less
hendricks has entered carrying the camera brought up from the bottom by the divers
i want to go over your reports and your form
they go into brodys inner office the uproar continues behind the door but its calm in here
i never heard of a
i just made it up
it means get me out of there
notices the camera what the hells that
tom andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser
its a little early in the season for that
home port is newport rhode island
if i had a boat i sure as hell wouldnt leave it anchored alone in the channel
if you had a boat thered be an investigation
hendricks puts the camera in an informal lost found box sitting in the office
brody makes the mistake of opening the door revealing the white haired man
grace kinney is driving my boy to distraction
hendricks get a description of that dance
to brody chief brody
i want to talk to you about my daughter
shes but mature for her age
chief ive been telling mrs
prendergast that its no good just talking about albert shes got to do something
look the township is responsible for protecting life and property and my property is unprotected
as brody turns to deal with the mess we looking up at the surface where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight
theres a commotion and a water ski drops into view
then another one
pale legs churn the water
off amity beach a bilious green lap straked boat is bobbing in the water the engine idling
two girls are fooling around the one in the water is terry the one driving the boat is diane
did you ever see a dolphin
they like to play
we may see some today
she fumbles with her skis
whoops almost lost one
cant play with the dolphins without skis
hang on hang on
diane goes to the controls and puts the engine into gear starting forward
terry waves okay diane opens up the throttle the boat surges forward pulling terry upright
a wake boils out from under her skis
ed and tina are camped on a blanket necking in the shelter of the dunes
theres a portable radio a cooler with some beer and some sandwiches a perfect afternoon alone
above the dune behind them lies the ocean where the girls ski boat can be seen raising a big wake
tina disengages and sits up brushing sand out of her hair
take a break for a minute okay
tina stands and looks out to the sea where the boat is towing terry on the water
eddie can we do that
no reaction can we go skiing
we can use my uncles boat
with you everythings next week
i want to go skiing soon
ed grunts non comittally
tina takes a beer from the cooler and goes up on the dune to watch terry and diane
she waves to them and to someone down the beach
an old lady grace witherspoon is rocking on her porch also enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves
she acknowledges tinas distant wave and turns her attention back to the skiers
having a wonderful time
terry is good criss crossing the wake showing off
rushing through the water waving stunting
she waves at diane who leans over the controls to coax more speed out of the old engine
following the skis effortlessly closing in on the turbulent wake
terry whipping along a fin raises near her
she glances at it waves thinking its a porpoise
the fin slides low in the water heading towards her
she puts the rope around her waist leaving both hands free
closing in on the wake crossing it
the fin cuts across her path
too late to maneuver terry hits the looming gray back of the shark
the skis bump leave the water terry takes a spectacular spill
the rope around her waist tows her helpless through the water gagging her preventing her from shouting
she flounders as diane slows the boat to see whats happened
turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or hurt herself
okay okay coming
she still doesnt realize the gravity of the situation she hasnt seen the fin
hysterical pulling herself hand over hand up the rope trying to get to the boat
closing in on the thrashing figure
screaming as the shark rises from the deep and takes her
suddenly shes gone a swirl of pink froth marking the water where she went under
looking around for her friend suddenly panicky
she pulls the rope hard and tumbles backward as it comes up with nothing on it just a cleanly bitten end
then the shark appears blood on its mouth lunging up and butting the stern jarring the engine loose
fuel spills from a ruptured line
she throws things at the shark which slides back under the water
diane can be seen flailing in the boat very distant screams floating across the water at this range they sound like the normal shrieks of teen age girls having fun
as the shark hits from a fresh angle this time taking a chunk out of the boat biting down with powerful jaws
diane hurls seat cushions oars anything she can lay hands on
she fumbles desperately in a compartment produces a flare pistol
she cocks it and fires point blank at the shark
the flare hits wet fuel glistening on the water and skin of the shark explodes in a sheet of flame
a last flash before the gasoline explodes
no o o o o o
a sheet of fire shes in the middle screaming aflame the shark forgotten
she falls into the water as the ruined boat overturns and theres an oily explosion
ed and tina look up as they hear the distant crump of the boat blowing up
witherspoon looks up startled by the sudden tragedy
she gets up to go to the phone indoors and we the launch is anchored at the site of the explosion offshore
red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook
hendricks is on the radio talking to the shore
i cant find anyone out here
they mustve gone to the bottom or drifted with the current
hes on the porch of tile witherspoon house using his portable walkie talkie
witherspoon is waiting in the b
nearby we can see a sign buried cable call new england light and power before digging
the cable itself surfaces in a chain link fenced enclosure and climbs a power pole for distribution to the island
ed and tina are also there having given statements
there should be bodies
witnesses say two people one in the boat one skiing
filtered i told you nothing here
for how long
currents moving everything around and its getting dark
stay on it
i dont care how long it takes
brody turns to ed and tina and takes out his notebook
we heard this noise like a boomp out there and when we looked there was just this cloud of smoke
that was the explosion
one minute they were having a wonderful time the next bang
i dont know what couldve done that
brody stares out at the quiet sea whats lurking under that calm surface
can we go now
brodys still looking past them towards the ocean
chief brody can we go
as he gazes at the ocean we hear the sound of a distant siren and an ambulance siren wailing and red light flashing drives on its melancholy way through the
hendricks has the winch in operation the cable in his hand with big grappling hooks attached
the boat is lit by its powerful worklights
hendricks heaves them out watches as the current takes them then puts the winch in gear hauling back
how much longer
until we find something
i dont care about the overtime im hungry
and most of all bored
it goes taut with a sudden strain
he sees it too
i think we got something
red moves to the winch watching warily as it slows to a near stall with the weight
about damn time
what the hell is it
theres a strain on the cable its pulling the stern of the boat down as it struggles with the weight
here it comes
lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch
the cable from the winch is taut pulling something up from the black depths
the coupling appears then the hook and an oily cable
what is it
he hits the release on the winch and the cable whines as it spins out and settles back on the bottom
red jiggles the line trying to free it up
it comes here from cable junction
untangle it and lets go we dont need a blackout on the island
at the winch now youre talking
lets get out of here before we do find something
the next morning the brody family is downstairs each getting his own special breakfast
mike gets cereal for himself and sean ellen is cracking some soft boiled eggs brody is drinking coffee and smoking

youll have to make up your own mind about that
wheres my day book
in the den
ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it
he doesnt have to work all the time its his vacation
silvera enters from the service porch
good morning everyone up early today
theres a lot going on
he follows ellen into the den
ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table looking for her book
why dont you take a half day and clean this junk up
because im in the middle of a boating accident i got only four regular cops and one secretary and a chief deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat
hes another one
she finds the book ah ha
what is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating

she heads out the door for the office

mike passes through on his way out nodding to mrs
silvera who acknowledges his passage
brody is close on his heels

weve had a lot of trouble
the back door slams behind him

sean nods resigning himself to the inevitable

silvera nods and pours sean a glass of milk
brody sighs and heads out the door
sean calls after him
im going to be careful all day
sitting snug and ship shape on mikes green machine are mike andy brooke and jackie
they are heeled over in a brisk wind making good headway sailing nearby in the b
are patrick and lucy and donny and denise in their boats
from her boat wherere we going
oh out a ways
maybe the lighthouse
no big thing well see whos out there maybe picnic
we got some stuff at the store
ed and tina are going to be there
oh sure they would be
whats the lighthouse
its an island near here with a lighthouse
we sometimes hang out there you know
i got some wine
she opens her big floppy bag revealing the top half of a jug of mountain red
brooke slides over to her
aside the lighthouse is a make out spot
now i really want to see it
you going to fool around with mike
jackie shrugs well im not doing anything with him
she indicates andy who pretends great indifference
well maybe i will then
andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool
mike concentrates on his sailing jackie grins an impish vixen grin brooke shrugs
spectacular view from the top of the old lighthouse showing ocean sandy beach some of the kids catamarans pulled up on the sand other pleasure boats cruising in the b
ed and tina are running down the stairs laughing
come on back up here
give me back my hat
where andy mike jackie and brooke are camped around a blanket listening to a portable radio
ed and tina run by
whyd they decide to move
too hot in the lighthouse
too hot for those two
i cant believe it
is there something i dont know about
i told you remember
so why arent they doing it now
theres a little round of giggling
maybe by now they are
theyre moving pretty fast
running towards a dune and over it
covered with birds
ed and tina appear over the crest of a dune and the frame explodes in a flurry of seagulls suddenly disturbed
the whir and drumbeat of wings and the shrieking of the gulls is a jarring shock
the huge hulk of a beached decomposing dead whale a few birds still pecking at scraps of blubber and entrails
big festering red holes mark its sides
from the top of the lighthouse we can see a group of interested spectators clustered around the whale like ants at a picnic
a few more boats are beached and riding at anchor just off the shore including the amity police boat
three ants are walking towards the crowd one of them gesturing
shes lureen elkins a marine biologist from the oceanographic institute and shes skeptical
brody is the ant whose antennae were waving in the long shot
as soon as i heard about it i called you
this thing is big
his arms indicate big
after weve looked well talk
this is it
he moves forward to clear the crowd
some kids are poking the massive hulk with sticks
a tourist couple is snapping away with a polaroid sx
the whole mess stinks too
move back please
open it up a little
the crowd edges back giving way to brody and elkins
whatd i tell you
brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches the dead thing indicating a huge open wound on the side
look at that
first things first
she produces a tape measure and gives one end to brody
from the tip of the snout please
elkins is measuring the length of the creature
she calls off numbers to hendricks who is officiously writing it all down repeating numbers as he hears them
length feet inches
come on lets check the bite radius
cold the what
you know the size of the mouth
the whales mouth
the sharks mouth
brody pitches his voice low so that the crowd wont listen
the shark that did this
it was a shark wasnt it
we dont know that do we
but thats what were here to find out right
you dont tell me my job and i wont tell you about yours okay
i cant hear you if youre going to whisper
can we go now
he turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to return to their blanket ad libbing good byes
to mike you stay here a minute
you heard me
well be over by the lighthouse
ill be right there
they hang around waiting for him
elkins has reclaimed brodys attention
could be a shark
but maybe not
look i know a little bit about sharks
i know that this was probably a great white shark
he fumbles for the correct latin
helping out carcharadon carcharias
okay so thats it
is there one in these waters
what makes you think there might be
because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish
this is a mammal not a fish
jesus dont quibble with me
i want to know if a great white shark did this
look sharks are attracted by blood and thrashing around
this is a new one sound
like sonar or radar
they home in on irregular sounds unusual sounds any rhythmic low frequency vibration
so theres one around here
these wounds couldve been inflicted miles out to sea or more
none of them are immediately fatal
currents couldve carried the body miles further
chiming in we got a helluva tide this month
could you just keep that crowd back please
you stay right here
youre going in with me
as elkins examines the whale calling her observations to hendricks
we came out in my boat
andy can sail in it
i got a date
lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predator attempt to seize the tongue
additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub dorsal areas as well as the caudal
oriamal bite radius inches allowing for salt water erosion and subsequent small predator and scavenger tissue attacks
the kids have moved a little closer to hear whats going on between father and son
i dont want to discuss it
elkins crosses to brody
its either a great white or another killer whale
cant you tell
not when its like this
this animal has been ashore for hours and drifting for a day at least
every little nibbler in the seas taken a bite
look can great white sharks communicate
send out signals or something
you know take revenge sense an enemy
dont be ridiculous sharks dont take things personally
brody turns on him
this at least is something he can do something about
no more sailing
you come back with me and thats it
because i say so
ill tie up at the town dock dont worry man
see you later mikey
ad lib vaughn and brody enter walking through the spare empty town meeting hall towards the conference table
they are alone
im showing summer rentals
we got a helluva season going
we have got to talk and we have got to talk alone
larry i dont know how to say this but i think we got a shark problem
a real one
vaughn stares at him then unlocks the door to his private office mayor and leads brody in
small expensively furnished in antiques with a few symbols of amity boosterism cluttering one wall a photo of the beach featuring a shark tower an architects rendering of the new
holiday inn some charts and graphs showing upward progress a few stills of businessmens luncheons plaques awards etc
are you serious
look ive got some missing persons fatalities evidence of a large predator
no one has seen a shark no fin no bites nothing
i got a feeling
i have to act on it you can understand that cant you
of course i can but cant it wait
these things cost money and this town doesnt have much money
we have to do something
we have done something hell we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach its the only one in miles yknow
i know i know
and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel theyd need worth of steel net around their beaches
in new england
we all lost on that one
its still a good idea
martin when we build up our tax base a little you can have everything you want right now the towns broke
please larry theres good reason
those water skiers
interrupting a tragedy
but that was a boating accident no bites no sharks nothing but a boating accident
two of them are still missing
theres always deaths in these waters that never turn up
are they all shark victims
maybe they are
brodys overstated his case and he realizes it
ill give you bullshit theres a dead whale out there with bites all over it
shouting back what am i an ass
when you called me i called elkins and her bosses
nothing she saw is proof of anything
someone has to do something
back in control dont push it this time
if you do it wont turn out the way you want i guarantee you that
the two men study each other for a long moment
then ive got to get back to work
he holds the door for brody who walks out as vaughn lags behind locking up his sanctum
brody is alone in the jeep headed for the safety of home and family
he drives past the towns billboard its covered with an architects rendering of the amity holiday inn
the sign reads when in amity enjoy the holiday inn
plastered across it is an added streamer now open
barely visible underneath are older notices under construction and opening in june
as brody passes the sign he impulsively swings off the main road and heads down towards the beach
brody is on restless patrol checking the waters edge as he continues on home
as he drives along he sees a clambake some teen agers in a group necking and dancing and a few solitary surfcasters and fishermen
the beach is deserted the sun is setting and brody and his jeep have the sand to themselves
its then that he sees something a big bow section of a ruined burnt boat is bobbing in the surf just off the beach ahead
its a piece of the waterskiers boat brody heads towards it
as brody slows his jeep just short of the water and gets out to look at the flotsam
his shoes get wet
he backs up onto dry sand then tries to edge closer to examine this object
it bobs up and down in the surf brody makes get in here motions
the junk resists
come on give a guy a break
he takes off his shoes and socks and rolls up his trouser legs
a silly sight
he wades into the water after it
come to poppa
it eludes him and he flounders after it
a big wave breaks across his crotch
hes almost there its just beyond his reach hes got it hes lost it he has it again its slippery
ad lib come here
come on sweetheart
a little closer
then hes got it exultant gotcha
as he grabs the ruined wood and pulls it towards him
suddenly the mass of wreckage breaks apart and something lunges out of the mess and into brody
brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror the gory remains of diane burnt beyond recognition flesh peeled away discolored charred ruined by days in salt water
he screams and scrabbles in the wet sand trying to get out of the dreadful clutches of the half human thing hes dredged from the water
extricating himself puking retching splashing water on his face washing his hands frantically just behind him the thing lying on the sand a gruesome joke played by the sea
macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of sodium cyanide from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose
follow the syringe and reveal brody working at his desk in the deserted office
he is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed
hollow point ammunition a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array he is filling the last of them sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle
the radio scanner is monitoring the local police band routine reports faintly in the b
a slow night in pre season amity
as a sound at the door makes him look up
he hides the odd gear as hendricks enters starched and crisp in his uniform
i missed you at the funeral home
santos said you were here
you didnt miss much
christ what a mess
the woman passenger on the boat that blew up
theres an awkward pause
brody sees the box with the divers stuff sitting where it was left earlier
what about that camera
that one from the wreck
you brought it up did you look inside it
hendricks guilty look confirms he didnt
well what the hell might be something worth seeing
take it somewhere and see if theres film in it
catching on if there is develop it
you got it
the deputy rummages in the locker happy to be on the trail
i know just where to go
not the drugstore
of course not theyre closed
phil fogartys place
hell do it for me
the drugstores closed
what the hell time is it
nine thirty ten maybe
shit im late for dinner
close up okay
and he runs for the door the speed loaders with the cyanide bullets safely in his pocket
at the door oh yeah im expecting a long distance call very important
give them my home phone
brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed loaders are safe inside then exits
as hendricks watches him go brodys jeep pulls up and he gets out beat
he is slouching towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside
he perks up and starts to move faster
ellen is on the phone in the den as brody enters the house
the kids are on the floor in front of the tv playing an electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the following
into the phone thank you
ill tell him
hanging up sort of matthew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora presently in the antarctic ocean and wont be in radio range until half past next spring
he starts upstairs casually concealing the towel wrapped package of gun and ammunition
is hooper coming to dinner
not till next year
he goes upstairs ellen waits a few beats then follows him
brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom where he carefully puts the gun in the bed table
ellen finds him
oh hi how was dinner
oh perfect a per cent family affair
where were you
getting up santos place
they both know what that means the morgue
brody goes into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively
ellen follows brody watches as he washes under too hot water
thats what i said
is there any of that hand cleaner stuff
use the little brush there
why were you at santos
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal
want to talk about it
mike comes up the stairs and is starting into his room when brody spots him sean is just behind him
you want to come here a minute
mike shrugs and crosses to his father sean whizzes past on into his room
what is it
he expects something this is a formal audience with the head of the house
i got something for you to do tomorrow
i kind of had plans
mike nods forget it
no more boats
hey come on
i spoke to upton at the beach and hes got a job for you there
you can work until school starts
he wanted a job hes got one
i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night
we see seans door opening as he peeps into the hall to see what the fuss is about
it opens a few inches he looks out at the grownups and his brother decides he wants no part of this and quietly closes the door
out of the water
mike silently storms into his room not so silently slamming the door as he exits
from inside the room loud rock music muffled behind the door an expression of teen age rebellion
not so loud
the music lowers its volume
brody turns to go into the bedroom to take his shoes off to go to bed
i know what youre going to say
on the bed in the city it happened all the time some kid o
s on a rooftop top a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops
because of the smell and the flies
call the cops
what are we immune
it was bad wasnt it
the goddamn smell is always the same
he shudders at the recollection are you going to be able to sleep
i think so
he raises his voice mike
keep it down for chrissake
ellen gets up and quietly closes the door
the upstairs hallway is empty the doors closed
the brody household compartmented and closed for the night
the familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands theres a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to the tall steel tower that dominates the beach
a classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking area followed by vaughns cadillac the parking attendant waves them into a preferential area where they disembark vaughn peterson ellen
and some more prospects including a woman named bryant and her daughter renee
this is the town beach the development naturally has its own private access but i wanted you to see the concession area
look at that sand like sugar
he scoops up a handful of the fine powder
ellen directs the attention of the photographers
during the summer the sun sets right there
she points over the water
to ellen ill say hello for you
ellen nods preoccupied
vaughn strolls away headed in the direction of the cabanas
mary nichols a local selectwoman emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions
hello selling some more of the good life
a piece here a piece there it all adds up
your husbands been here all morning
whats he doing
good naturedly his job
michael brody dressed in township workmans coveralls is repainting some flaking woodwork
sean is happily mixing paint
vaughn joins them
your dad got you working
he continues his chore without enthusiasm
you know where your dad is
he points at the tower
oh for christs sake
he crosses briskly to where peterson is finishing
and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities ellen brody here will be happy to answer them
len can i see you a minute
peterson excuses himself and joins the mayor
i think we got a couple of live ones
brodys riding his tower
looking up oh shit
sweeping the water with binoculars restless eyes trying to scan everything a grim watchman high over the heads of the unseeing crowd
larry vaughn jr
comes skimming in close to the surf
bob is handling the sheets larry is giving young jackie sailing lessons at the moment hes showing her how the tiller works
hes on her like glue
this is fun
can we go faster
to bob trim
bob does larry trims the main and the hull lifts
she snuggles in larrys arms
he waves to someone
thats my dad
jackie waves without seeing
vaughn waves back preoccupied
near him mike brody looks up his face grim jealous and now a little nuts
he splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon
to peterson wave to my son
waving how the hell do we get him down from there
maybe nobody will notice
lets get them back in the bus
bryant approaches them tugging her daughter
renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there
hes ah watching
a precocious little girl its a shark tower
i saw one in florida
hes looking for sharks
its an observation platform
thats our chief of police
hes just checking it
normally its used for ah bird watching
weather measurements that sort of thing
a little desperate ellen were running late
folks if we could get back on well show you the country club and stop for lunch
at the mention of lunch the prospects all hungry begin flocking back into the van
peterson herds them along
the country club has an hole course putting greens and twelve tennis courts
his body suddenly tenses
theres something out there
he mashes his binoculars to his eyes trying to get a better look
through the binoculars something big and black moving under the buoys and into the swimming area
he cant believe it
but looking past him we can see it with the unaided eye a seething dark mass moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers
screaming out of the water
everyone out of the water
no one can hear him
a few little faces look up unable to catch what hes saying
he starts climbing down the ladder shouting
get out of the water
tell everyone to get out
out of the water
recalling another panic oh my god
what the hell is he doing
looking up startled at brodys sudden panic
the dark mass almost on top of the swimmers who are starting to look around
most of them are oblivious to whats happening on shore
as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water fumbling for his gun and the speed loader with the cyanide bullets
he is bumping into people knocking little kids over stepping on blankets and umbrellas a madman
out of the water
running too half stumbling half believing remembering
moving after her husband while mike steadies sean holding the impulsive kid back
seeing something martin
the gun is out now hes trying draw a bead on the shape in the water chest heaving he tries to steady his shaky grip
people see the gun and scream throwing themselves flat on the sand running some of them going into the water
dont go in
bullets ricochet off the water howling towards the horizon
real panic now
four more shots
reloading ejected rounds falling bright into the sand brody on his knees fumbling with bullets
standing on his platform shocked watching the chief of police fumbling with his gun
its a school of bluefish
it is bluefish a tight mass of them churning up the water in a dark dense group
the swimmers look around confused by the shots and excitement
whats going on
anyone got a net
someone get me a rod and reel
laughter defuses the tension in the water bathers move around some getting closer to see the fish others leaving the water to join friends and families on the sand
where brody is now standing panting coming down as a crowd collects at a safe distance around him ellen emerges from a group that includes vaughn peterson and nichols
curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy
brody realizes hes fired his weapon that spent shells litter the sand at his feet
okay its all over go on its over
ellen joins him
brody drops to his knees fumbling for the cyanide bullets in his gun trying to put things in order scrabbling in the sand for the empty shells
the crowd is curious and embarrassed
some turn away others drift back to their blankets talking about whats just happened others stare rudely
brody is coming apart
its all right everythings all right
sean emerges from the crowd and helps his daddy pick up the bullets ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious
lets go everyone
bryant len please
he sees sean his eyes fill with tears and he grabs the kid in a fierce hug
a hurriedly called meeting of the towns selectmen is in session vaughn peterson and three others kaiser an old man still in his grocery clerks apron sansom and nichols the
woman on the beach
brodys a good man
nobody says he isnt
you shouldve been out there
you shouldve seen him waving that gun like a maniac
there were shots fired
he thought he had a good reason
but thats not rational behavior
thats what im saying
how many people were there
what are they going to say about us
to vaughn larry im a businessman trying to make a buck like anybody else
so it cant be done like that
the mans a menace plain and simple
look what am i supposed to do
its done its over
we have to deal with the consequences
thats what were here to do
lets go into my office where we can have a little privacy
as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters
vaughn deliberately closes the door as they find seats around the room
i believe we have a quorum and informally i suggest we call this meeting an executive session and dispense with minutes
brody alone is sitting at his desk morosely studying a little gold statuette of a pistol marksman
whats done is done and brody is trying to figure out how to live with it
the phone rings is answered in the other room
the buzzer sounds
brody picks up his end
polly no calls please
she insists okay okay
he punches a button hello
ill be right down
he slams down the phone and gets up to go suddenly possessed with a purpose
amid the equipment clutter and proofs some shots of the holidome opening drying on wires
phil fogarty the indignant fat man and town photographer is locking the door behind an impatient brody
i dont know what you did but that kid stopped
i havent heard one peep not one breaker breaker for days
believe me its a pleasure
you said something about a camera
sure sure jeff hendricks brought in this camera see from underwater and i didnt know how to get it open but my brother in law in montauk he works at
a hi fi store and they sell cameras so he
interrupting did you get any pictures
well yeah i did thats the funny thing
you cant tell much from the negatives i was going to blow em up
heres a test i did
he holds out an x proof brody snatches it from him
brody stares down at it
sure enough the ghostly outlines of the orca underwater a diver on the deck making a gesture at the camera
not bad thats a real fast lens probably
look at the diffusion though
what else you got
lets see you got a minute
come on phil dont jerk me around
okay okay stand over there
he gestures brody steps to one side of a table with some big enamel pans for washing and developing prints
phil switches to a red light and takes some printing paper putting it under the enlarger
enlarger light going on
timer ticking the hand turning
quick negative images water boat diver hand boat again tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence projected on the enlargers flat base
hypo and developer sloshing in a pan under phils hands
brody staring down
quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer a print of what at first looks like seaweed then is unmistakably the grinning jaws of the great white
a quick nightmare vision of brody alone in a sinking orca trapped in a battered cabin interior a great white crashes through the glass its head huge as it lunges
the close up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a great white if you
hadnt seen it as a memory it would make no sense at all
for brody the meaning is all too clear for anyone whos never seen the monster face to face its nothing
shaken that one there
phils hands holding plastic tongs gently slosh the print in the bath
the sharks features are indistinguishable from the surrounding detail
brody walks into view and starts up the steps into the town hall already lit from within
hes carrying a large envelope
the selectmen kaiser sansom nichols len peterson and vaughn are seated informally around the big table
looking up speak of the devil
brody enters carrying the envelope with the photo
thank god you guys were all together
i got something for you
martin this is kind of an official meeting perfect
look at this he fumbles with the envelope
chief the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer
is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence
the questions out of left field
why are they asking
so jeff could handle things
he knows the routine he has the authority
it came up during the meeting
look i just got this from phil fogarty
it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers
it proves i was right all along
he throws the picture down in front of them
they bend over to study it pass it around look at it
its underwater isnt it
thats why its so dark
i dont know what is it
its a shark
a great white
jesus its right there
he snatches up the photo
just as before an ambiguous pattern of light and dark not proof of anything without brodys inner vision
its nothing i can see
waving the picture
what are you all blind
its a shark
look teeth jaw gills
is that what it is
youre damn right thats what it is
im sorry i just dont see it
sansom and kaiser agree ad lib thats nothing
martin it could be anything
exploding what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls
jesus its right there in front of you
i know what a goddamn shark looks like ive been through it dont you understand
ive seen this sonofabitch before
the selectmen look at each other in the face of brodys agitation
tempers are running high
what have you seen before
this is nothing
something in the lens
be reasonable please
to vaughn forget it he wont listen
there is nothing to discuss
blowing up will you listen to this man
will you just listen to him
to brody you really caused a panic on a public beach you shoot up the place god knows who couldve been injured what if somebody decides to sue us
that could ruin us
is that what it is
ill pay for it
take it out of my salary
you dont make enough
maybe i dont make as much money as some bullshit rip off artists around here but i dont work the same way
whats that supposed to mean
it means i dont like all that grab ass and heavy breathing with my wife it means i know whos out to screw me here and it means that i
know something none of you know because ive been there and i dont want to go through that horror again
theres a long pause
martin could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something
go ahead whatever its worth
the selectmen file into vaughns office leaving brody alone in the room
the last one in the door very carefully makes sure its tightly shut
brody sits alone at the table
they are sitting there deliberating
i wont mention his personal attack on me
ive never seen him like this
and hendricks is qualified you heard that from his own mouth
we made a motion and it was already seconded
official very well then
it is moved and seconded that martin brody be relieved of his duties as chief of police his contract with the township be terminated and that jeff hendricks be appointed
acting chief in the interim
those in favor
all the hands go up
anyone opposed or is it unanimous
vaughns hand goes up the sole dissent
they stare at him
im sorry but i respect his convictions
the motion is carried
he goes to the door and opens it
could you come in please
the police jeep pulls up and stops although the engines shut down brody still sits quietly inside the car
then his hand appears at the window and he drops an empty beer can onto the lawn
after a while he drops another beer can then another until the clinks tell us hes polished off a six pack on the way home
not too steady on his feet brody climbs out of the car and starts for the door to his house
ellen is working at her desk in the den
she is looking towards the door expectantly its been an unusually long pause between car arrival and husband arrival
i closed a sale today without len
thats commission if the papers go through
thats great too
he takes a long look at her
you look about years old sitting there
like you were doing homework
he goes to join her bumping into some furniture in the dimly lit room
ellen has a beer and sandwich half finished on her desk brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer
sensitive whats wrong
i just got fired thats all
he tosses the photo sloppily on the desk
whatd i say
that you were fired
then thats what i meant
out on my fanny
the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police
just like that
because of today
expansively no sweat
a blessing in disguise
back to the city you can go to bloomingdales without waiting six hours for the ferryboat
were surrounded by water here you realize that
me surrounded by water
were not going any place
you love it here
tell me what the hell happened
showed them the photo showed them the goddamn shark big as life
they didnt see it
not like me
not like the poor son of a bitch who snapped this lil picture
hes out there somewhere
i shot off my gun shot off my big mouth so they fired me
studying the photo honey this is nothing
i dont know what it is
what did they
going on everybody wants the job
no one wants the authority
he can go out there in that precious boat and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me
call me in new york
tell him to kiss my ass
seeing his pain they have no right to treat you like that
youve given them everything
for four years youve protected this town the people on this island
at ellen im not a hysterical man
i know what i saw
i know you did
goddamnit i tried
now im tired
i cant keep fighting it
im too tired
brodys slipping under the beers and the day have finally overcome him
he slumps in ellens arms
youre drunk is what you are
she eases him onto the couch tucking a comforter over his inert shape
take it easy
sean comes down the stairs sleepy in his pajamas
is dad home
i heard something
he comes into the darkened den
go back upstairs
sean finds the photo and stares at it idly
she takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the room leaving brody tucked in on the couch dead to the world
this is the amity teen agers hangout a newsstand and pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed
a jukebox is blaring some n

she just likes to tease

some rock music starts and we ellen is asleep under the covers brody still in his clothes from the night before is sprawled on top obviously hes stumbled upstairs sometime
during the night
theres a noise down the hall from mikes room
brody stirs but doesnt wake up
mike is holding a lamp thats almost fallen the noise we just heard
hes almost dressed but not quite satisfied with his image in the mirror
he takes off his clean shirt and checks a more comfortable worn shirt
a brief sniff to make sure its okay for another day and he puts it on he tiptoes to the hall where a noise stops him in his tracks
mike is frozen in his part opened bedroom door
seans door opens and little sean also fully dressed comes sneaking out
whispering youre going out
youre going sailing
louder i want to go with you

sean does and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to mike the two of them start downstairs
michael and sean are walking away towards the road into town
brody emerges from the bathroom dressed in sweatshirt and cutoffs no uniform today
he starts downstairs stopping only to look into mikes room
good morning america
a grin crosses his face my son the don juan
he goes downstairs
brody enters from upstairs

bob gets the message and shuts up
the sizzler fills its sails and points out of the harbor
lots of day sailing kids a few bigger adult boats some working fishermen and sport fishers a typical recreational boating mix
the kids are finding the same general direction pointing out of the harbor
sails being trimmed
brooke and timmy staring into each others eyes as he sets a course straight for the lighthouse
larry lifting a hull almost losing bob
the kids boats in a loose bunch slipping out to sea
the dive class boat isolated near the channel a group of kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult instructors tom andrews crosby and sparky
andrews and his assistant instructor sparky are addressing the class when mike and andys green machine sails by close
youre supposed to be in class
today im staying topside
you dive for me
im going for lobster
find one for me
with butter if they got any
andrews dismisses them with a good natured wave
so long turkies
he turns to his class
sparky will take you down today
if everyones got a buddy well drop
the class dutifully lines up and starts going in while in the b
the kids sailboats head out to sea
andrews two partners crosby and sparky get ready to follow the class over
to andrews lets get some dinner
he goes over andrews following
sparky is with the class signaling down they submerge like clumsy seals
the class paired up is drifting down sparky offering encouragement as they descend
andrews and crosby are already disappearing swimming away with strong kicks
as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker deeper waters
crosby checks his depth his watch looks around
far above him the class going about their business
below him murk depth and suddenly a big lunker bass
andrews sees it too
assuming crosby is following he takes off following the big lunker
crosby hung up in some minor equipment problem misses seeing him go
the two men are separated
follow andrews as he twists and turns after the bass going deeper losing him in the rocks suddenly rounding a boulder and meeting almost face to face horror the great
white shark taking the striper in a single gulp its looking up at andrews with one glassy dolls eye it turns to face him directly and we see the scar ugly red and black charred flesh from jaw back on the right side eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive uncaring face
andrews mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water
finning backwards he ditches his weights gulps for air and yanks the cord on his safety vest
it balloons out and pulls him up surging towards the surface
the mouthpiece useless falls away from his lips
eyes closed hose dangling andrews hurtles upward holding his breath in a final fatal panic passing a startled crosby
look over at the rocketing ascent
sparky signals up and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface
crosbys already surfacing
andrews is on his side bloody froth on his lips
one of the class is clinging to his legs trying to arrest his convulsions
sparky is holding his shoulders trying to administer mouth to mouth
get us in
for christs sake get us in
in his arms andrews writhes pain knotting his limbs
behind them in the water the fin surfaces and casually turns towards
the shark is headed for the sea
and for the now distant kids in their sailboats dotting the horizon in their familiar bright colors
they are alone
in the middle distance the rest of the kids sails can be seen headed for the lighthouse in the distance
the sandpipers sails are luffing theyre making no headway
you want to tack or just leave her pointed up like this
snuggling close just like this
what about sailing
the tides running
itll take us to the light
itll take us to budapest if youre not careful
ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the current
first things first
he fumbles in a cooler chest produces a bottle of wine
what about the others
theyll be there when we get there
might even have a fire started
whatre we going to do in the mean time
well think of something
he pours the wine into the two paper cups
but first a little juice
kissing her mmmmmm
resisting wait a minute
promise me something
that youll put down a blanket
ive got black and blue marks all over my butt and my moms getting uptight about them
you got it
and he fumbles for a blanket in a locker thumping and banging gear around as he rummages for it
tina sips wine contentedly satisfied to wait
the sandpipers hull alone above us as the shark rises with dreadful certainty attracted by the erratic sounds of eds hasty search
the terrible fin breaks the surface about yards out then dips and disappears
then impossibly fast the entire sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge as the shark lunges up against it from below an unseen horror
ed is knocked over the side into the water
as he breaks the surface shaking the hair out of his eyes trying to orient himself finding the boat
he starts to swim for it tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard
he has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface rushing him towards us through the water
before ed can react to the pain he is slammed face first into the boat
his jaw breaks blood smears his nose and lip
his hands grab the wooden cap rail with a death grip
tina is staring down at the water terror stricken eds arms and head are f
as he locks onto the boat with desperate hands
eds hands on the rail knuckles white an iron grip
with awful finality the force pulls down and the wood shatters and splits away as eds hands are pulled down and under by the awful force
her mouth working silently unable to scream staring down at the blood and froth on the water swirling in a grim eddy under her the sandpiper rocking gently in the
on the way to the lighthouse but away from the harbor the kids are sailing in fairly close order the sloops polo timmy marge heeled well over in the stiff
breeze the faster cats mike larry donny etc
skimming around tacking more often faster and more maneuverable
she ducks under the boom handling the jib sheets with easy familiarity
they come about and scoot off on a new tack
reading the wind trimming sail expertly competent and alone
to a near by boat great day
i think the winds going to change
he comes about she slides into him he holds her to steady her she snuggles into his arms
true love at last
in his inflatable poking slowly along
marge passes him sean hooting with glee
marge is faster
im getting new sails then watch out
just a question of modifying the rigging
jackie mike and andy clipping along larry vaughn and bob in the sizzler nearby
mike lifts the hull jackie squeals in delight
how fast is enough
i want to go faster
he trims his sheets the cat heels more one hull flying andy and jackie clinging to the trampoline
larry is carefully adjusting his tiller bob senses what hes doing
you coming up on him
they gybe sharply running up behind the green cat
were on the starboard tack
running close to each other very tight two by two
dont let him pass
mike and larry silently fight for clean air racing
water splashes over them
my hairs getting wet
he veers onto a less dramatic tack sparing jackies hair
larry and bob speed by yelling
when do we get to the lighthouse
soon dark eyes soon
the tides turning
andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character
were going to be fighting the current
he looks up winds backing around a few points too
jackie snuggles against mike
i cant wait to get there
but of course
he goes forward to trim the jib leaving the lovebirds snuggling astern
they pull away from us and we ellen and brody are in the jeep hes driving her to work
theres a crowd at dockside and the town ambulances now familiar blinking red light
brody out of force of habit wheels the jeep towards the action nudging through the crowd which gives way to the official blue and white vehicle
hey its not your job any more
im going to be late for work
just one minute
he gets out and pushes through the crowd ellen following
the dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the police boat where hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance
the police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts some non essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on the deck
hendricks is on the dive boat kneeling next to andrews
andrews is shaking bloody froth on his lips and chest
the shaken divers are huddled together an ambulance attendant is wheeling a gurney into position
crosby and sparky are stunned
what the hell happened
air bubbles in his blood
came up too damn fast
held his goddamn breath
he is near collapse himself
something scared him
an ambulance attendant is putting a blanket around sparky
were taking care of him
the other attendant holds something out to brody
brody examines it a scuba mouthpiece bitten in two useless
howd this happen
bite reflex like a spasm
right after the kids went out
who went out
all of them
mike junior vaughn brookie peters pat lucy all that whole gang
looked like they were headed to the lighthouse
how long ago
about an hour maybe two
thinking lets see i came on about eight
brody is gone pushing through the crowd
brody is casting off lines
ellen is on the dock watching him
whatre you doing
uh chief look
youre not chief any more
brody keeps working making ready for sea
i cant let you take her out
you cant stop me
ellen is climbing aboard taking off her heels
brody look if he cant go then you cant go
neither of you can go
mikes out there
but i signed for the boat
youre not authorized any more
brody starts the engines with a roar and slams it into reverse
the boat starts out of the slip then lunges to a halt shuddering on its still fastened bow mooring line
untie that rope
its my job
ill do it
and she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat
brody is shifting gears the boat is crabbing sideways as he puts the helm hard over
it bumps the dock hard
youre too close
goddamnit hendricks untie the rope there
hendricks goes to the bow jumps aboard and frees the bow line
the boat slips into reverse the water boiling as brody guns it away from the dock
he takes the wheel eases off on the rudder and comes about pointing the launch out to sea
what the hell they cant fire both of us someones got to be in charge right
which way are we going
find the kids
the lighthouse you said something about the lighthouse
get us there
the amity police boat brody ellen and hendricks aboard is headed under full power out to sea
hendricks is pumping the horn warning boats out of the way ignoring the rules of the road as small boats scatter out of the way we can see the ambulance
red light flashing pushing out slowly through the crowd at dockside
as they clear the harbor mouth brody is on the radio ellen is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse hendricks is steering
amity launch to harbor patrol over
filtered harbor patrol
is that you brody
can you get your chopper airborne
in a few minutes
hes down checking a buoy in the bay channel
get him the hell over to amity point the old lighthouse
theres a bunch of kids day sailing that way
turn them back to port
just do it all right
soon as i can raise him
if theyre not at the light look for them
i dont want them out there
get them back to port
exasperated affirmative affirmative
turn the kids day sailing back to port
i heard you
as brodys eyes sweep the horizon anxiously hendricks pours it on and the police boat surges forward
donnie and denise and susie are sailing close to each other
lets go eat now
shouting to susie were going in to eat
she nods agreement their boats veer off from the rest and head towards the lighthouse
as it sails close to the green machine
want to race
how about a side bet to make it interesting
lets race for something
loser sails home alone
aside to mike youre betting what you already got
i dont care
i love it
sure you do you win either way
simply im supposed to
its a bet
once around the marker buoy
thats the pin the buoy
larry is confident hes got the air but mike suddenly gybes without warning snapping onto a new fast tack downwind
larry and bob are caught by surprise and lose precious moments as they fumble with their sails
pulling away turkeys
he pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat moves ahead a drumming sound
the twin hulls of a catamarans hull the muffled eerie sound of drumming as the water carries the tempting thud thud thud sound down to the deep
falling behind as the boats change course for the marker buoy following larry and mikes lead
wait for the h
brooke and timmy sail by him laughing polo with them
cant were watching a race
larry and mike
pat and lucy are trimming sail moving faster
mike and larry are racing
loser goes home alone
if we beat them they can both go home stag
jackie can come back in this boat
what about me
maybe you could give polo a hand going in
snapping him with a rope your ass i will
besides the winds turning with the tide
sailing back is going to be a bitch
ropes and sails rattling through blocks
sails snapping taut filling with wind
catamarans heeled over racers hanging over the water dangerously suspended in trapeze harnesses
skippers faces concentrating on boat handling
its the choppers point of view as the harbor patrol copter from the cape flies towards the kids following brodys previous instructions
he sees the sailboats and fly that way
filtered into his mike air patrol to base
i have visual contact on the kids
going down to use the loud hailer
it approaches the sailboats losing altitude fast rotor blades chuffing up a storm
the pilot has his microphone to his lips and his voice is blaring down at them
this is the harbor patrol
return to port immediately
return to port immediately
the kids look at each other some coming about awkwardly others luffing wondering what this is all about
to mike your dad must be really pissed
we better go back in
its not going to be easy
were fighting wind and current
i though wed be out longer catch the incoming tide
putz that wont be for hours
i was counting on hours
return to port
were trying were trying
he waves acknowledgement and puts about
the others take their cue from him and set a rough course back but without much success
might as well
polo timmy and brooke marge and sean
they see the faster catamarans come about and try to beat back
theyre turning around
coming about then
are we going back
going to try
she puts about the three of them start back towards the lighthouse not making much headway
dougs inflatable is the slowest and he is now by virtue of his position at the head of the line beating back towards the island
the others in the b
make way for the carrier enterprise
it whistles and visibly leaks under the strain
looking down in dismay
make that the titanic
he rigs a little foot pump and begins thumping away trying to breath air back into the raft
patrol one to base
looks like theyre turning back
all right patrol
go back to work
youve wasted enough time
looking up at the scattered hulls of the sailboats the turbulence from the low flying chopper making a vast circular pattern of irregular vibrations
it wheels around and heads back towards land
rushing through the seas under full power
about three hundred yards ahead a small seemingly empty sailboat ed and tinas sandpiper
further off a day sailing power cruiser sport fishing
its not his boat
hendricks maneuvers closer slowing the engine reversing in time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump
ellen watches apprehensively as brody drops into the little boat
on the sandpiper nope
he sees something hold on
brody moves around on the deck of the sandpiper until he discovers tina cowering in shock a sudden revealing of a terrorized victim
a moan n o o o o o o
its okay its okay
whats the matter
its still there
what is it
its still there
to hendricks and ellen i need a hand here
hendricks has gotten a blanket and he steps over putting it over the shivering girls shoulders
ellen comforts the girl
what is it
i knew it
i goddamn well told them
he moves abruptly stepping up onto the police launch snapping on the radio leaving hendricks ellen and tina on the sailboat moored alongside
amity launch to harbor patrol
filter this is cape patrol what is it brody
i heard you werent chief anymore
what about those kids out sailing
its all okay colby got to them
they were turning back when he left em
he left them
hes got work to do in bay channel
get him the hell back there
we got possible fatalities
his eyes wild brody looks over at the sandpiper then scans the nearby waters with sudden tension
ellen and hendricks comforting tina on the sandpiper
nearby a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by
brody pulls the police boats air horn the cruisers passengers look over hendricks and ellen jump at the unexpected blast
im going out there
hey you cant do that
what is it
whats the matter
mikes out there
brody starts the launchs motor throwing clear the mooring line that ties the two boats together
to hendricks get her in
get them both in
chief be sensible
where are they
about degrees off your starboard bow take a heading leeward of sand island and lay her north by northeast
never mind that shit
pointing see where cable junction is
look to the left
and he kicks the engine into gear moving the launch away and out toward the sea
he guns the engine as soon as hes clear
hendricks gives his jacket to a suddenly chilled ellen and hails the cabin cruiser already changing course to pick them up sounding its horn
ellen stares after the receding boat
my purse is on that boat
they are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse fighting wind and tide
only dougs inflatable with its clumsy little motor is making any headway
playing at being charles laughton
pump up this boat
and shave that silly moustache
pumping steering hes floundering along
the shark has fixated on something one outlying shape the easily identifiable outline of dougs inflatable thumping and putting
it homes in on the sound
the other kids exchange banter with doug in his raft as he clowns for their benefit
england expects every man to do his duty
you may fire when ready gridley
damn the torpedoes full speed ahead
despite his pumping the bulging patch bursts with a loud bang
someone pop your balloon
no problem no problem
want a lifesaver
how about a skyhook
you sail your boat ill sail mine
a fin rises partially almost invisible to most of the kids but mike notices it believing it to be a porpoise
hey fetterman you got company
the place is a mess
before anyone can react the shape rises behind doug striking his raft a terrible blow
not making any headway themselves they casually watch the class clown wondering what hes up to this time
a distance from the rest
it shakes then blows up as big teeth grip it from below
doug goes flying into the drink
the shark has the inflatable in his teeth and is shaking it from side to side
dougs eyes bug out as he sees whats going on
he begins treading water backing away as fast as he can waving his arm in the air frantically pick me up quick
he sails to where doug is being carried along by the current
the inflatable is a mess shredded rubber and dead engine the shark didnt like it
doug carefully oh so carefully strokes over to where mike and andy can pull him abroad
some of the others sail closer to get a look
what was that about
what was that
so much for the rubber duck
this incident hasnt yet touched them no one actually saw what it was except doug whos never been serious about anything
a shark ate my boat
im telling you a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat
if he liked your boat i got some sneakers hell love
theres nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of dougs inflatable
some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth
ad lib jeez what did that
a porpoise maybe
nah killer whale
i think he snagged it
i hate to pop his balloon
dougs inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull forward
without warning the shark hits
screams terror confusion
mike andy jackie into the water
his head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over
patrick and lucy ram into timmys boat locking into it knocking timmy into the water as brooke screams
as the following events take place larrys red cat rams and locks onto mikes tornado
marges boat capsizes putting sean and marge into the drink
marge scrambles up on the over turned hull pulling sean up with her just in time
polo under full sail scoops mike out of the water before the shark can get to him
the shark dips out of sight
showing the results of the turmoil as they make ineffectual frightened moves towards grouping together andy is the first to gain any composure
raft em up
he reaches towards a drifting line and pulls timmys doughdish towards them tying it off as it comes close
tie off to your strongest point
anyone need an extra line
polo has mike and timmy aboard his boat
timmy is looking up from examining mikes dazed body
can you sail
testing his rudder yeah
well take him in
he starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse on a severe but manageable tack
polo timmy and the injured mike sail towards safety leaving the others behind
tackle the job at hand concentrating on survival
jackie is strangely quiet things are out of control
clearly marked amity island amity lighthouse cable junction
brodys nervous finger traces an approximation of his course
it fumbles pauses stops
brody looking up from his chart scans the ocean
ahead is the lighthouse his immediate destination
out of sight to the right cable junction and beyond that miles of cold atlantic
brody looks up from his chart and grabs the radio
on radio amity launch to patrol air unit one
harbor air where are you
filter this is air one
that you brody
any fix on those kids
im still down
for christs sake get going
im all alone out here
brody i got to switch frequencies call my boss
well meet you over by francis shoal
harbor air out
where the hell is francis shoal
brody realizes something im all alone out here
the amity police boat under full power surging through the heavy swell brody very much alone at the helm
we can see brodys boat approaching
it slows as it nears the island
he puts the wheel over slewing the boat around
to the left the wrong way
it barrels off to the left
floating in the current drifting away from the lighthouse towards the open sea
floating on the wreckage and tangled boats are doug andy jackie patrick lucy larry bob brooke marge and sean
anyone know what time it is
larry bob patrick and lucy the practiced sailors ad lib equal dissatisfaction
tide doesnt turn for three hours
low tide at cable junction is p
whatd you do
memorize the tide tables
i cant help it it sticks in my mind
making light of it anyone want to play charades
no one does
as long as were drifting might as well go with the flow
three knot current
and an offshore wind
whats after cable junction
cant we stop
silence from the group
theyre probably looking for us
what about the fish
maybe its gone
they tend to follow moving things
maybe its following polo and timmy
they consider this
so all we have to do is land at cable junction and wait
first we got to get there
howre we going to do that floating on this garbage
anyone got another set of sails
the kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available
is that big thing still out there
a panorama of open ocean a quick fly by to orient us first cable junction then a mile or so ahead the raft
more sail some improvised rigging patrick and lucy trimming what there is trying to steer the clumsy contraption
from afar the distant sound of an approaching chopper
waving over here
the kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue chopper
dont everyone jump around
but they ignore him
the copter is descending
a one man light spotter the space next to the pilot cluttered with tools and floats lashed in place
below seen through the plastic bubble the raft growing larger as the chopper sets down
air one to base
i have a positive location on that sailing party
disabled and adrift
he checks chart on his knee board about miles west of cable junction wind and current carrying them just about due east
i count ten juveniles
the helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets down a huge circular pattern of prop wash on the surface as the rotors slow to a halt
the kids are waving and jubilant
as the pilot unbuckles opens the door and steps out on one pontoon he speaks through a bullhorn
the kids ad lib in the affirmative
can you put us on cable junction
i got no room for passengers
how about a tow
can you rig that
the pilot nods
larry heaves a line to him the pilot catches it and makes it fast to a convenient tie off on the undercarriage
as soon as you get us on the island you got to call in
my dads the mayor
interrupting theres a shark
the other kids all chime in adding their ad lib shouts describing what happened calling for help etc
its all a noisy jumble the pilot ignores it trying to do his job
the kids all shouting at once jackie is screaming
you have to take us off
you have to
why dont you take us
calming her its an observation spotter he doesnt have the room
he finishes tying off and yells through his bullhorn at the kids
im going to give you an assist to get you on cable junction
then ill call in and get the coast guard to send a cutter
hang on to something
he climbs into his bubble shuts the door gives the kids a thumbs up and starts the engine
engine turning over
a line tied off to one of the ringbolts on an overturned hull it pulls taut out of the water
the raft kids watching in fascination and anticipation
the whole operation getting under way
looking up at pontoons wreckage wind turbulence on the surface the heavy thud thud thud of chopper blades
in the f
the fin rises and starts for the scene
as it starts to lift inexplicably
the pilot reacts as attacks one of the pontoons biting down on it clamping great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats
rotor blade spinning wildly
pilots hands jerked on the delicate controls
shot copter shaking
closeup engine and gas tanks rotor head spinning
closeup pilot in buffeting cockpit
the kids watch horror stricken as the giant shark hangs on the roaring copter in the b
cable junction is looming closer
the copter tilts dangerously the shark bites deeper harder
as it tilts
then the unspeakable the blades touch the water and explode
chunks of murderous steel break off the shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles
reacting ducking in terror
huge chunks of disintegrating rotors are flying all around
masts and sails left standing before are chopped into a deadly salad
as blades skip and crash the bubble of the overturned copter pilot trapped inside sinks into the sea
pilot struggling with his safety harness trying to hit switches working on instinct
some air in the bubble but water too and sparks as electrical connections short out and burn
then the shark powering out of the murk
as grim death batters at his fragile bubble
the bubble cracks
water floods teeth snap at the slippery plastic the pilot fumbles for oxygen as the shark veers off into the murk
the kids reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the waves
calm for a moment then look out
screams no o o o
the shark reappears and batters at the raft
the raft shudders and begins to break up under the pounding
the kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage
marges overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath
he and marge topple into the water
sean is bobbing in his life vest marge strokes to be near him
in the water swimming for the apparent safety of the raft
then the fin and the massive bulk of the killer heaving up through the waves
she heaves him up out of the water hurling him with desperation towards the safety of the floating hull
screaming hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he struggles for a grip on the slippery surface
behind him marge helping as much as she can from the water
then behind her rising like grey doom then dropping out of sight
marge is gone
marge ducking under the bulk of the shark shoving off with panicky reserves of strength swimming away underwater while the shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged
follow marge as she swims
huddled in the cracked plastic bubble the pilot is sucking air from his oxygen tank
he sees marge and slips out of his bubble headed for her
as the pilot overtakes her a moment of horror as she thinks the shark has found her then relief as the pilot motions to the bubble and indicates air
she follows him
scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken chopper buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube
the chopper tilts and moves breaking up on the bottom as currents move it
they struggle silently
as it slips across the bottom the current pulling it broken parts breaking off in slow motion dirty swirls of oil and hydraulic fluid clouding the water
a parallel struggle for survival as the current separates sean from the other kids marge is gone the little boy is clinging alone to the free floating lightening
copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath like a submarine destroyed by depth charges an oil slick pieces of broken blade a seat cushion then suddenly the pilot and marge
almost choked to death their air run out
they cling to a section of pontoon panting looking around with oxygen starved eyes
they are alone on the ocean a half mile away the distant sails of the broken raft and the low lying shape of cable junction
safe for now
he throttles down and the boat slumps in the water
he looks around sees nothing in all directions
he hits his radio
harbor air this is brody
air one come in
static no answer
he tries a couple of times checking the knobs and dials to make sure the units working
harbor air do you read
this is patrol base
the familiar voice is tinged with annoyance
hes had a long shift and nothings going right
where the hell is air one
thats what id like to know
lost transmission at cable junction
did he raise the kids
last transmission said ten juveniles
if you see him tell him to switch to an operational frequency or give me a status report yourself
did you say cable junction
thats what he said
might still be there
brody revs up and powers out headed for cable junction
sean is crying on his isolated perch clinging to the upturned keel
the other kids are throwing a rope trying to get him back
patrick heaves and misses
catch the rope
the others shoot fearful glances at the waters
hes got to help or it wont work
sean baby please
sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him paralyzed by fear he shivers alone
jackie is near catatonia herself brooke and doug trying to soothe her
it killed her
it ate her
its okay its okay
listen to me sean
the kid looks up dully
goddamn it sean you listen to me or i will kick your ass do you hear me
listen to andy sean
were throwing a rope and you better catch it hear
the other kids are encouraged
the rope is thrown it misses
to bob keep an eye out for that fish
bob climbs to a vantage point watching
in his haste to help larry overreaches to fish the trailing rope out of the water and falls headlong into the sea
shrieks of fright from the others
he scrambles out hardly wet thats how fast hes moving
finally patrick takes the crucial throw and the rope practically knocks sean off his perch but he clutches and holds it
as andy carefully calls instructions sean secures the rope and the others carefully carefully begin to pull him in
as they pull
the slippery rope is undoing itself
with the kids reaching out hands sticks rope anything to pull the little one to safety
the ocean swells rise and fall with hidden menace
hands gripping rope
the knot pulling apart
anguished faces concentrating as patrick lucy larry and andy struggle to bring him in
hes pulled to safety
they lash his little hull as tight as they can to the rest of the floating wreckage
bob sees something
cable junctions ahead
can we make it
i dont know
looking over the wreckage to cable junction now much closer
beyond it miles of empty atlantic
its off to one side and unless they can slow down or alter course they will miss it
to jackie you okay
shaking silent eyes glazed
alone dear jesus holy mary mother of god help us please
her lips move inaudibly to doug keep her warm
to jackie jackie
can someone help me rig a jury rudder
we might steer this
andy joins him and they try to make a sweep or a rudder out of whatever wreckage they can use
by when the tide turns around well be twenty miles out
more with this wind
i cant stop thinking
praying aloud god please help us merciful father in christs name we beg you help us please dear god save us help us please god help
he is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors boats
he puts the helm over and heads for them
polos sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the police launch bears down brody leaning on the air horn
the kids signal and wave
im coming alongside
the launch slows clumsily
timmy gets a line around a cleat and pulls them fast
is that you
a shark hit us out there
mike got knocked over
brody goes for his radio to report in to call for help
i passed out but im okay
at least youre safe
what about the others
the three boys look at each other
jesus dont freeze on me
what about the others
tears in his eyes seans still out there
he stops in his tracks radio forgotten
mike goes on he wanted to come
it was okay wasnt it
it was okay before
the others are ratted together
with the current
towards cable junction
brody jerks the mooring line holding them together freeing it
he starts for his controls obsessed
dad im sorry
dont go anywhere
just stay here
he indicates the lighthouse then guns his engine
stay at the lighthouse
he roars off headed towards cable junction
approaching cable junction the rafted boats are drifting towards the cable junction
larry patrick and andy are working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out of wreckage
lucy has another line out to a sea anchor trying to slow their drift
bring her to port a little
thats it steady
i think were changing course a little
can we land on it
if we can get to it
were going to die
comforting her its all right were okay
more to port
its all the way over
are we going to go on the island
you bet kiddo
the realist i dont know
what the hell were steering for it
the wind drift is lateral
whats that mean
sideways for every yard we go this way we also slide sideways this way
his hands illustrate the predicament
but we had it
we were headed right for it
shit shit shit
were going to miss it
the others are silent
larry bob and brooke try to alter its course by padding
but the island
they freeze as the raft grinds against something
the inverted mast of one of the wrecked boats is snagged on the rocks on the bottom
as it slows then stops hung up from below
what is it
were hung up on something
maybe the bottom
hysteria its that thing
its going to kill us now
were going to die
just shut up
leave her alone
lighten up man
its bad enough without her freaking out
shes hysterical goddamn it
dont yell at her
the group dissolves in bitter exchanges
no one is rational
lucy is the first to notice something
wait a minute
the group subsides only jackie is left keening to herself
theres a distant sound of a boats engine
bob spots it first and waves
the others follow his pointing finger
coming this way
under full power heading straight for them go crazy waving yelling screaming over here
in the boat coming up on the kids fast
he throttles back his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past
easy easy youll swamp us
brody fumbles with the throttle manages to hold his boat steady between the raft and cable junction island
were hung up here
can you get us a line
brody finds a coil of line makes one end fast then throws it to the kids on the raft
they catch it and tie it off to a cleat
we got it
go ahead slow
brody throttles forward the police boat shudders under the strain as the line goes taut
where the rope is tied off to a cleat
the wood groans screws pop whoa
the cleat rips out brodys boat leaps forward
come around again
as he repositions hes now between the raft and the island preparing to throw his line
he heaves the kids grab they have it they tie off again hang on hang on we got it
brody starts to pull the raft again when surfaces and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates the police boat from the raft
it lunges at brody as it passes the launch the fin hits the taut rescue line snapping it
brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past he spins the wheel and hits the throttle sending the launch hard to port
out of control it runs up on the rocks of cable junction
as it tips up on the rocks
brody falls equipment and loose material breaks loose and falls
held by only a few screws it pulls out of its mount and shatters on the deck
lifting high out of the water the screw turning in air
their horrified reactions
picks himself up and staggers to the rail sees his predicament
im okay baby im here
he climbs over the rail onto the slippery wet rocks trying to get to where he can help
the shark patrols the gap waiting
can you get a line to me
the kids find some line
andy coils and throws
brady catches the kids line
he heaves on it with all his might
jackie is hysterical some of the other kids are screaming
the sharks fin catches the taut line it slides up and over brody and the kids are nearly pulled into the water
the raft doesnt budge
the mast bends under the strain but holds the raft stuck fast
he sees the winch and hooks on his launch and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable puts it in neutral
the kids haul their line trying to bring the steel cable to them
the shark rams their raft impatient now
screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast
brooke huddles with sean jackie cowers alone
larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole an improvised weapon
unattended it drops into the water
get the cable in
they do but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface
it comes taut but doesnt budge
brody watches helpless for the moment
son of a bitch is stuck
climbs back onto the boat starts the winch engine trying to pull the cable free
on the offensive now takes an outrigger pontoon biting it tearing it off the raft shaking everything
the kids react to this fresh attack
its killing us
i dont want to die
the winch smokes and stalls the weight its pulling almost too much
come on you bastard come on pull
bursts apart from the center as the shark lunges up through the canvas trampoline of the sizzler
the kids screaming fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure into pieces
only sean brooke and jackie are left on the remaining segment
watching the destruction seeing sean practically alone in the water
he looks around the deck frantically spots a rubber emergency inflatable in its case
he wrestles it off its brackets and breaks the seals urgently
he hits the auto inflate
alone on the raft brooke and jackie helpless nearby the other kids flailing in the water
the huge bulk of the shark fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion
while brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the water the kids scramble for safety swimming for their lives
each one is sure this moment is going to be his last
get on the rocks
swim for it
andy is pulling himself towards the boat scrambling up on the exposed wooden hull
as she looks over her shoulder and screams the monster is sliding past her intent on bob
the rough hide scrapes her tearing her clothes leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her torso
larry and patrick help her towards the rocks
hes clinging to a piece of broken boat the shark lunges at him
grinding smoking hauling something out of the water heavy slimy dripping metal cable the main powerline from the mainland
paddling the raft towards sean with desperate strokes heedless of the danger around him
just hang on
he fights to see in the gathering gloom
suddenly a strange glare snaps on then more illumination in a series of escalating clicks
silhouetted against the evening sky
automatic timers are turning on navigation and worklights illuminating the barren rocks and rusty steel with their glare throwing dark shadows putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their
straining to see whats going on
looking for his son
he looks around desperately sees andy safe on the launch
use the lights
soaked clinging to the rail of the launch hearing brody fumbling in the cabin turning on worklights the boat throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many lamps and
andy grabs one and sweeps the water with it trying to help
where are you
his light pokes and sweeps through the gloom
he hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks
he is blinded by the sweeping searchlight the confusion of terror stricken teen agers screaming
its the middle of the inferno
sean standing up reaching out to him the shark hitting his fragile perch sean tumbling backwards towards what seems to be certain death
as he hurls his paddle at the shark anything to get even to distract it
he looks around him wildly searching for a weapon finding a steel boathook
he screams at the unfeeling shark
come here you son of a bitch
the huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new irritation
brody bangs on the raft yelling creating a commotion
lunges at the raft brody sliding desperately away smashing at the snout with his steel the tail fin bashing him as it passes
brody is drifting close to the cable drawn heavy and wet cut of the water
he reaches up to it
dangling his feet in the water holding onto the cable seeing it inspired with a lunatic idea
over here turns bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout its scar glistening wet and terrible
it heads for brody
possessed yelling at the top of his lungs
come and get me
come and get me
missing brody who hauls himself up out of the way in life or death spasm
the great jaws close fastening onto the thick cable
the cable resists for a moment then splits layers or insulation and armor crack open the jaws clamp harder tons of pressure then the live copper core is reached
leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body grounded in the salt sea
hot white fire shimmers like a halo the fish smokes and stinks sputters and dies
watching cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable
its strangely silent
the lights on cable junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains protecting the line
only the boats worklights provide light now
water lapping at the rocks some kids sobbing quietly
brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft expecting the worst
timmys doughdish where we last saw sean
theres a scrabbling from inside and sean appears soaked from under the seat where hed fallen
brody moves toward him holds out his arms taking sean onto his raft
they paddle back towards the rocks
with the kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks theyre wet scared exhausted but safe
sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land
they made me go with them
sure they did
he kisses the damp forehead
a crowd of worried parents and adults ellen and hendricks in the forefront are staring towards the harbor mouth
its dawn and the sun is rising
they see something a cheer goes up
a big coast guard cutter is steaming into the harbor a little group of survivors on the foredeck
brody and the surviving kids wave to their families on land
