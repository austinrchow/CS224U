href b b traffic by stephen gaghan by stephen gaghan based on the miniseries traffik by simon moore the state capital of ohio
its an impressive building for a city this size
in chambers striving for august justices listen to a lawyer mr
rodman argue his case before the highest court in ohio
rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice
this informant paid by the police using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm
a working farm
a farm where honest americans make their living
one particular justice robert wakefield younger than the others is clearly bemused by this performance
the government in its haste has employed an army of criminals whose allegiance to the truth is at best questionable judge wakefield interrupts mr
its too bad your client didnt show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney
a polite chuckle from the justices lately the only variation im hearing in your argument is the name of the client
and you can sit there all day arguing the ins and outs of illinois v
gates but you arent going to convince me that this country has not sanctioned the use of anonymous informants
beat furthermore there is no sacred protection of property rights in the united sates
when you make the decision to have marijuana on your farm whether its one joint or an acre of plants your property can be seized and your property can be
im sorry the court finds my argument repetitious
rodman may i offer a piece of advice
the next time you argue this point before this court regardless of my whereabouts i recommend you have something up your sleeve other than your arm
the office is marble and dark wood
a young clerk black enters carrying an oddly shaped gift
they both look at it
what do you think it is
depends who its from
reading the card your friends at warren putnam and hudson
you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff
three categories you like me you hate me you want something from me
re the elaborate box definitely third category
what would a law firm want from the new drug czar
depends on the state
medicinal marijuana initiative
beat or am i being cynical
they both laugh
robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of scotch from a shelf
he pours a couple of fingers in two glasses
maybe theres a book in it
the clerk takes one of the glasses
not by me
they toast and drink
robert exits trailed by a small group of reporters
he gets into a car being driven by two security types
robert sits in a business class window seat
an expensive hotel
robert wakefield stands at the window looking at the view of our nations capital
the remnants of a meal
it was a steak and a small caesar salad
the wine glass is half empty
in front of the mirror now trying on a dark tasteful jacket
on robert in the same position only now we are in his home
its daytime and his wife barbara is helping him into this same jacket
as her hands dust the lint off his shoulders in the hotel rooms making the same motions
satisfied he straightens then turns to look at himself
back at the hotel room window now
reaches to the table and lifts the wine glass
this is the middle of nowhere
scrub cactus and dust and a heartless sun
a broken down looking police sedan is parked on the side of the road
it seems abandoned except there are two men inside
two mexican men state police officers javier rodriguez s and manuel manolo sanchez s wearing jeans knock off polo shirts and cowboy boots wait patiently in the car
i had that dream again
a long pause
another long pause
where my mothers suffocating
they continue to wait until there is the sound of a jet engine
it grows louder as it approaches
the shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor
then an old dc flies fifty feet above the police sedan
they watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the desert
they look at each other and wait some more
from the direction of the landing strip a moving van lumbers down the road two teenagers in the cab
javi and manolo watch the moving van approach
javi reaches under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher
he rolls down the window and plants it on the roof
he flips the switch
he jiggles the wire and the siren burps and the light flashes
manolo and javi step from the car smiling
the moving van slows to a stop
the driver unhurriedly rolls down the window
is there a problem
theres no problem
the driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his wallet
how much do you want
the driver pulls a wad of bills
javi shakes his head
you want more than this
javi shakes his head
the driver exchanges a look with his partner
you want something else
the driver gets out and walks to the back of the truck
he opens the rear door
there are neatly stacked crates marked with a scorpion logo and
he reaches into one of them and pulls out a tightly sealed package also with the scorpion stamped on it
he turns to see javi with his gun drawn
manolo at the passenger side has also drawn his gun and is motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck
drop the package
put your hands behind your head
youre under arrest
the driver hesitates
he starts to comply then looks at javi and manolo
i dont understand
i think there must be some mistake
no theres no mistake
javi motions to manolo who cuffs both teenagers
the driver begins spewing obscenities under his breath
javi puts the driver in the front of the shadow
manolo follows in the moving van
the truck follows the shadow down a desert road
suddenly from behind four armored suvs with tinted windows appear closing fast
the suvs force both vehicles off the road where they pull to a stop
a long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus past the truck
finally the suv doors open and federal police officers surround them like a swat team
the passenger door of the lead suv opens and general arturo salazar s a squat powerful presence in a perfectly pressed uniform gets out and approaches javi
to javier whats your name
well javier rodriguez youve done a very good job but well take care of it from here
javier stares into the implacable reflection of his sunglasses
in the distance the dc takes off and roars over their heads
weve been following these narco trafficantes for some time but had not been able to bring them to justice
to his men put the prisoners in the car
impound the truck
the men follow salazars orders
to javi one question
how did you find about this
what is the name of your informant
beat it was an anonymous tip
salazar looks at javi a beat
to his men for a state police officer youre very well informed
javi and manolo watch the convoy of vehicles drive away
javier lights a cigarette
wasnt that general salazar
whats he doing up here
i dont know
they start for their car
two men ray castro s proud ambitious and montel gordon s suspicious of everyone including himself and always always the smartest guy in the room walk from a lincoln towncar
toward a dumpy office
castro is talking under his breath no telltales
nothing to read
not touching my face
not even blinking
beat howre you feeling
keyed up i feel good
no more pissant basin league bullshit for us hunh
castro stretches his arms swings them around
limbering up gonna stay loose keep it all together
take this motherfucker down
they reach the door to the office
gordon looks at castro then turns the handle
its a cluttered rundown working office unusual only in the extent of its ordinariness
a secretary goes about her business like a somnambulist
clerks shuffle and file
castro switches into spanish in spanish good afternoon ladies gentlemen
were looking for eduardo ruiz
we have a two oclock appointment
in a back alcove castro and gordon sit across a cheap table from eduardo ruiz s an entrepreneur in an expensive suit and bad hairpiece
they are waiting
you ever buy a quarter ton
not many people have
another businessman enters from another door and whispers in ruizs ear then leaves again
so its worth the wait right
what can i do
rent a huey
have an airlift
its not like you can put it in a condom up some mules asshole right
how many peasants would that take
a line stretching from here to mexico city nobody said shit eduardo one of ruizs hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun is holstered on the underside
were waiting thats it
hey you want to hear a joke
i got a joke
why do women wear makeup and perfume
chill out its a funny fuckin joke and its quick
why do women wear makeup and perfume
i dont know
cause theyre ugly and they stink
castro laughs uproariously
on fuzzy surveillance video castro laughing
ruiz politely smiling one of his hands hidden by the table
man you never been close enough to a woman to know how she smells
whats his hand doing
watch his hand
i dont like the hand
the room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment
dea agents in dea logod outerwear jiggle a monitor fuzzily displaying the view from another hidden camera gordon and ruiz around the cheap table
this is ridiculous this fucking thing
taps monitor look at this shit the first television transmission
i had better shit when i was the av guy at junior high swear to god
come on castro pay attention
watch his damn hands
another businessman enters the office and whispers in ruizs ear
another agent peers out a window through binoculars
a blue van makes a slow turn into the parking lot
two fbi agents in jackets reading fbi hide on an opposing roof
they look through high powered binoculars
binocular all right here we go
the blue van
three unmarked vehicles
picks up walkie three unmarked vehicles accompanying
the unmarked cars split up and one turns into the parking lot of a fast food restaurant
the other circles around the back of a building
local or customs
oh man i dont know
looks like the cavalry
this is our show
i dont want to share this one
through the window ruiz gordon and castro watch the van disappear into the bay of a storage unit
a man is pulling down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars roar into the lot surrounding the unit officers exit the cars with their guns drawn gordon
and castro stare in disbelief
ruiz fires the gun under the desk which hits gordon full in the chest knocking him backwards
ruizs men run into the room pulling guns
castro dives and pulls his weapon firing at ruizs men hitting both of them
ruiz bolts through another door
castro pursues talking into his shirt collar agent down
repeat agent down
gordon gets slowly to his feet shaking off the blast to his kevlar and runs after them
the dea are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who are shooting back
from all over the stake out location dea agents emerge firing their weapons
an equal number of fbi agents emerge firing in return
nobody was aware of the others presence
its chaos a clusterfuck of law enforcement zeal with three competing sets of good guys shouting through bull horns gunshots and screaming
ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot cutting between two buildings
castro emerges and chases him
ruiz runs out the back of the storage company
he cuts between parked cars heading for the fun zone a kiddie restaurant
castro enters the fun zone
theres a cardboard cutout of spastic jack a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit version of jar jar binks promoting the special edition glass collect all four
theres an enclosure filled with colored plastic balls
the restaurant is empty except for a clown filling out a time card
the clown stands
hey dudes were not open yet
castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving toward the room of colored balls
gordon enters the restaurant and follows him
an animatronic band starts to play a song
gordon sees a half hidden foot buried underneath the plastic balls at the far end of the room
he takes careful aim and fires
ruiz screams and sits up
castro pounces on him disarming him and roughing him up
castro and gordon shove ruiz into the sunlight
they wait while their eyes adjust
take me to the hospital
im bleeding to death
castro shoves him forward
dea has opened the back of the van where a quarter ton of cocaine is spilling out onto the pavement
a bong hit is expelled into the air
in the living room of a comfortable preppy guest house private school teenagers party and hang out cigarettes in ashtrays beer and bong on the coffee table loud music
the tv is on with the sound off
the curtains are closed
the four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled askew the three girls clothing are also identical
some sit on couches some on the floor
they are stoned
one intense looking boy seth abrahams wild curly hair and the attitude of a young coleridge and a girl caroline wakefield really sixteen which means she looks about pretty and
flirtatiously irreverent sit at a desk in front of a powerbook g playing an on line trivia game
seth speaks rapidly and precisely
father of greek tragedy
okay aeschylus it is
hits keys his trilogy
i mean this is beautiful can anyone stop the seth machine
hits keys score
madmax from omaha we own you
and tragedy is closed out
seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror
he hands it to caroline who effortlessly does one
the susan lucci section or banal love songs of the nineties
seth looks at her
he has a crush
banal love songs it is
hits keys hey you wanna try something
they both take a swig of beer
he takes her hand pulling her past the stoned people on the couch seth takes out a box of baking soda
he tears off a square of aluminum foil
he takes out a spoon
caroline watches as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon
he adds a pinch of baking soda
he puts in a few drops of water
stirs it around with the heel of a lighter
then holds the flame under the spoon
what are you doing
concentrating just watch
he watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and bubbles then separates
he pours the most viscous part onto the aluminum foil making four separate little puddles
he quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen making a straw
he hands it to caroline
inhale the smoke and hold it
what is this like freebase
he lights the flame under the aluminum foil
the puddle crackles and pops then starts to smoke go
theres a rush of thick grey smoke
caroline catches most of it
she pulls it in deeper and holds
suddenly her expression changes
her eyes lose their focus her face slackens an almost sexual response
seth is watching her intensely
now you see
caroline slumps back against the counter
seth moves against her kissing her running his hands over her breasts and body
she stares over his shoulder holding it as long as she can
finally she exhales more
the cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room
the white house chief of staff meets with robert wakefield
the chief of staff has the floor he always has the floor
this is a man you do not want to disappoint
until you officially take over the office of national drug control policy under no circumstances should you speak to the press unprotected without going through this office or having someone
in the room
there are a lot of interests in this town and right now theyre all scared of you
the reason theyre scared of you
technically you have veto power over their budgets
so think about that fbi cia dea customs treasury atf defense irs radio shack and the dmv theyre all gonna want to speak to you
and thats the good news
youll also be meeting senators and congressman each with a specially prepared question
their question is designed for one thing to make them look smart
if you lecture them they wont think you respect them
if you respond with utter humility they will
remember this is about your respect for them and the presidents respect for them
speaking of which as soon as he gets back from russia and china well get you in there for some face time let the two of you catch up
beat itd probably be a good idea for you to meet your predecessor
ill have jeff sheridan take you over
also four weeks from today you will give your first official press conference
in it you will outline the presidents strategy for winning the war on drugs
beat okay anything else
ill be sure to let you know
robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the endless corridors of the old executive building alongside jeff sheridan an enthusiastic government employee who has found his place
i just want to be clear about one thing
i used to work for him but now i work for you
im not a partisan person im an issue person
in the next few weeks if you allow me well get you well versed on an incredible array of issues
the most important of which in my opinion being mexico
i know everybody that youre gonna meet
its important that they like you
its not important that they like me
thats why i can help protect you
like you protected landry
i see where youre going with that but if i could just say something which is basically that a guy like landry is so autocratic he doesnt know how to
let himself be helped its a point of pride to take every bullet no matter who fired it or whether it was even aimed at him which personally i think it very self defeating
now dont get me wrong hes a man of enormous integrity but theres a political component to this job that the general just didnt have any patience for
robert and sheridan enter the office of outgoing drug czar general ralph landry s buzz cut professional soldier with a sense of humor
landry is putting some personal items in a box
jeff you want to excuse us for a minute
sheridan nods and leaves
bemused off sheridans exit functionaries
nice people the schedule cs
about twelve graduate degrees apiece but it seems sometimes all they do is start rumors
robert and landry shake hands
youve done a fine job here sir
the office of national drug control policy is in better shape than when you found it
landry tries to determine whether robert believes this
he looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere
im not sure i made the slightest difference
wistful i tried
i really did
there are a lot of encouraging statistics
the works just started but i intend to see it through
youve got my word on that
youre here for two years three maximum
whatd they promise you
checks roberts reaction not supreme
ive come in to do a tough job and thats what im going to focus on
general landry sighs
when kruschev was forced out he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor
he said when you get into a situation you cant get out of open the first letter and youll be saved
and when you get into another situation you cant get out of open the second
soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place
so he opened the first letter
it said blame everything on me
so he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm
beat he got into another situation he couldnt get out of so he opened the second letter which read sit down and write two letters
they stare at each other a beat
then landry smiles
a cinderblock house
kids and dogs in the street
a face we recognize as manolos peers out of a curtain into the street
the ceiling is stained the floor sags
a cheap radio plays
manolo is at the door
javi sits at a dinette table
he talks to manolo but watches manolos wife anna s a nice looking ostensibly demure young woman as she moves around the kitchen
if they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert
they wouldnt do it in front of all these people
theyd send someone later when were alone
manolo tenses and throws open the window
yelling out the window away from the car
manolos pov out the window as kids play in the car sitting behind the wheel
even if that were true theyre not going to come to your house where youre waiting for them
theyll do it when youre walking somewhere make it look like street crime
shut your fucking mouth
nobodys talking to you
anna sets a cup of coffee in front of javi and stares at him
javi and manolo cruise through the streets of tijuana
if you want her to stay out of it then stop telling her everything
you should learn how to keep a secret
she hears me on the telephone
anyway i dont think well ever see them again
everythings back to normal
a cacophony of street venders panhandlers and vehicular traffic
javier and manolo are speaking with a flustered young american tourist couple
youre a police officer
arent you going to take a report or something
dont you want to know what kind of car it is
its a brown ford explorer it was right here
its been stolen
i want to file a report
filing a report will not help you find your car
the police wont find your car
but youre the police
javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number
call this man hell find your car for you
i dont get it how will this guy know who has our car
the police will tell him
theres a beat of confusion
why will they tell him but they wont tell us
getting it because we pay him stupid
to javier right
and he pays the police
and then our car appears
better than filling out forms right
the man reaches in his wallet and offers javier a twenty
javi waves him off
javier and manolo walk back to their squad car when two suvs come to a stop in front of them
javier and manolo exchange a look
the doors slam and footsteps approach
a ladies luncheon in the nancy reagan dining room overlooking a putting green
the bejewelled wives of successful men yammer at one another around tables with rich flower centerpieces
one wife helena ayala ex model with a sweetness and intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty stares out the window at a small boy using a putter as tall as
helena is six months pregnant and radiant
a waiter brings helenas starter course
her friends nan dobbs early s post junior league a little tipsy stewie and alex same league watch her duck salad
nan cant believe it
helena you never order duck salad
well thats true
re her belly i think someone else is asking for it
well hes got good taste
isnt it the most wonderful thing you ever tasted
i mean ever
its delicious theyre the most marvelous little creatures
they fly swim walk
and so cute with their babies marching along behind
looking for a nice sauce ala orange
helena is by far the youngest in her crowd
its a very fatty bird
all that winter insulation
just like me
you mean all breast just like you
youre bad singsong jealous thats all ive heard
i cant remember where
that its full of that good kind of fat the kind youre supposed to eat unsaturated fat polyunsaturated
and now theres a good cholesterol and bad cholesterol
everything they tell you completely changes every other week
i dont know why they think we should listen at all
what i know is ducks as cute as they are were designed by god to be eaten
nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward also a sea of inanity swirling around helenas salad
helena buckles her little boy david into the front seat of her mercedes
he wont let go of his putter
ill put this in the back
no all the professionals keep them in the trunk
not tiger woods
especially tiger woods
sharing a secret actually he keeps his on the back seat
she pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it on the back seat
a modern high rise on the waterfront playground of san diego
helena passes the hotel in her car
a standard room looking out at the water which is dotted with sailboats and cruise ships
the bed is covered with hi tech surveillance equipment
the equipment salesman lonnie s who makes a fetish of gadgetry explains the finer points of operation to francisco frankie flores s sallow watery eyed in expensive clothes
gates myrhvold bezos
i sell to all those guys
because the technology to intrude has reached the masses
your competitor your ex spouse adversaries stalkers theyre at the local electronics store right now and theyre gonna be intruding on you not only through your telephone but your fax
cell phone pager cable tv musak windows walls air conditioning ventilation modem and internet connection
he walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment nobody has these babies no way not the shiznit
frederico picks up a piece of equipment
i want to intercept cell phone calls digital and analog
and locate the source of the call
i need databasing capability to cross reference calls and numbers
lonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device attached to it your cellular secretary friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum
beat so francisco what do you do
you a pi
francisco looks at lonnie coldly
not missing a beat assassin okay
lets get you started in surveillance
the house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks
people enter and party voices drift out
a power cocktail party in full swing
this is where most of the business in washington gets done
robert scotch in hand listens to a smug pharmaceutical lobbyist explain the world
we in the legal drug business and i mean merck pfizer the rest of my very powerful clients realize this isnt a war with a traditional winner and loser but
an organism at war with itself whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants
and if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up kills a year
cocaine manages a measly
same for heroin
but the big daddy is big tobacco which kills each year which by the way is more people than have been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last
faking it thats very interesting
the lobbyist smiles
robert sips his drink
in another room
listening to stan overweight advocate for the united states council of chambers of commerce
its time robert to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators getem to fess up that its pretty much prisons or casinos in terms of their choices for economic
listening to ethan earnest advocate of harm reduction
whats the difference between prozac and ecstacy you ask
ones a mattress and the others a trampoline
molecules dont have morality
really think about it some molecule changes the way a serotonin re uptake inhibitor works its not suddenly a bad molecule its just a molecule
my theory america has a real fear of short intense experiences
robert turns away under his breath like you
robert at the bar getting another scotch
a secretive man tim s nerdy sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear
some say problems others say solution
imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the thc out of marijuana
imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving from dilaudid to dove bars
law enforcement hasnt let science sit on the sidelines
addiction is no more relevant than polio or the black plague
tim slips away into the crowd
robert moves away from the bar
an argument is breaking out between an economist and an undersecretary of defense with robert as the audience
to the undersecretary youre not battling traffickers or dealers but a market and the market contains a paradox if you arrest traffickers you raise prices and you also raise profits
which brings more traffickers into the business
to the economist back in the real world were talking about mexico and not john maynard keynes
we will spend billion dollars this year on this war and the question on the table every year is do we certify mexico as an ally or not
another man rush phillips a middle aged powerbroker overhears then joins and robert is encircled
you want to make a difference hit the users
you dont jeopardize our financial markets by some hypocritical stance on drug consumption
were snorting it why penalize mexico for supplying it
mexico dont talk to me about mexico its the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profits
thats economic truth addicts dont vote they dont have pacs they dont spend soft money thats political truth were locking them up and consumption is falling the price of coke
and heroin has dropped and purity has increased
all this law enforcement has achieved is kids can get better stuff cheaper
in economic terms you can forget it this is not a winnable war
christ you want to decertify somebody take pakistan or columbia
we dont need them for anything
if you manage to seize an inconceivable percent of all drugs coming into this country youll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than percent which wont affect
drug use at all
why are we calling this a war at all
you dont declare war on your own people
addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside
michael adler about roberts age and as successful but in a different way approaches catching roberts eye through the arguing demagogues
we need mexico for these reasons number one defense two trade three tourism then way on down the line comes drugs
the president knows this
whys he holding everybodys feet to the fire
wakefield theres a situation that needs your attention right away
robert looks at michael squints looks closer then follows
oblivious one in sixteen americans is of mexican descent
mexico our third largest trading partner
youre looking pretty good for an old guy
my work keeps me young
which part getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities
the worst serial killer in history who
killed forty two people
our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day
michael you represent drug dealers not civil libertarians
we kidnapped noriega out of panama
is that covered in your constitution
because it isnt in mine
noriega is a criminal
noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u
so no i dont have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government fighting people like you trying to keep this system a little bit honest
amused last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country
i hope when you were on the bench judge wakefield you didnt handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion
if i ever return to the bench counselor adler i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments
eduardo ruiz lies in a hospital bed handcuffed to the railing
his bandaged foot is held aloft by a sling and a tube drains the wound
he is tugging on the handcuffs as castro and gordon enter the room
you planning on going somewhere eduardo
you dont like it here
this is the best situation youre going to have for a long long time
i am a legitimate business
check it out
tax records everything listen you motherfucker you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon
you cant visit me here
i want my lawyer
the amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states
move em to texas fry em up
we got you on tape making the deal
we got you bragging about the quality
we got you bragging about your business
we got you
a nurse appears in the doorway
gordon goes to the door and shuts it in her face
one chance here eduardo
make us believe you got a boss
no boss its all on you
its a death sentence
ill never make it to the trial
we can protect you
ruiz looks at them in disbelief
who do you work for
this is coercion
thats a big word for a fisherman
who do you work for
gordon and ruiz stare at each other
i know another word
a starter castle high in the hills near mount soledad an exclusive neighborhood with views of the ocean
joggers jog to the sounds of tennis and jacuzzis gurgling and lawn care equipment operated by mexicans
behind the ayala gate we see david playing with his golf club on the lush lawn
workers set up the party under the direction of a professional party planner
a bmw il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway
the window lowers and we see carl ayala s handsome charismatic second generation american in expensive conservative clothes covering his cell phone as he greets his kids
he goes back to his phone call pulling around to the garage
david goes back to his game
there are maids in the house and a cook in the kitchen
the large rooms are filled with fine art
helena ayala sits at the dining room table with plans bills and receipts spread before her
carl enters and paces around the room continuing his cell phone conversation
into phone im sorry jonas
i dont care if that is the price you have gotten in order countries
helena watches her husband pace as he talks
he cant help it but a portion of this call is theatrical for an audiences benefit which in this instance happens to be his wife
helenas expression of annoyance resets itself into love
this is america a different country
i am carl a different man
so you see everything about our situation is different and i believe the pricing will be different too
beat listens youre a reasonable man
so take the weekend to think about it
carl clicks off the phone turns to helena
every day with this guy is like starting all over again
carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with his wife
he looks at her
she looks back
just watching you
i got that
how was your day
she pushes the topiary away from her
suddenly she seems tired
carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant belly
you all right
i keep feeling like im forgetting something
her husband watches her then wraps his arms around her
carl and helena step out on the front porch of their home and watch david play with his golf putter
an unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall
another arrives and another and another
officers in dea jackets exit the cars
there is murmuring then silence
helena slowly turns to look at her husband
he doesnt look at her
david come inside suddenly police and dea enter the front yard
gordon and castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to carl
what is this
what is going on
youre under arrest for violation of federal narcotics laws
gordon and castro spin him cuff him and without emotion begin pulling him from his yard
david is trying to get to his father
in a kind of shock
helena trails after him
castro drags carl into the street toward the open door of the cruiser
he pushes him down into the backseat
we have a warrant to search your home mrs
gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away
carl looks at his wife through the window
gordon and castro head up the driveway toward her house
helena is left standing in the street
neighbors who have appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways stare at her with suspicion
david approaches and holds onto her leg
javi and manolo wait in salazars anteroom
a ceiling fan swirls the air
after a moment the door opens and an aide motions to them
to manolo not you
javi goes into the room
the office is spartan and military
salazar and javi sit facing each other
salazar looks at a piece of paper
twenty nine years old
graduated from montessori school
five years as a beat cop in tj
three years with the state police
parents died four years ago in their apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford to fix their gas heater
your sister works in a maquiladora in juarez making designer blue jeans
on the police force three years you currently make dollars a month
salazar crumples the piece of paper and tosses it in the trash
thats your past
i want to talk about your future
would you be willing to do something for me
if i can
im trying to bust the tijuana cartel
what is it you want me to do
a small thing
javier thinks about this
does this offer include my partner
only if he can be trusted
hell do what i say
salazar slides a folder across the desk
javier opens it and sees a black and white surveillance photo of the informant
his name is francisco flores
he is a killer and gun smuggler for the tijuana cartel
i need to speak with him
i need you to find him and bring him to me so that i can speak with him
manolo faces javier
this is fucking crazy
instead of killing us he sends us on a suicide mission
do you know who frankie flowers is
hes a psycho cokehead hitman
hes killed fucking who knows how many people
youd need half the force to get close to him
and you cant get their help because he lives in fucking san diego
then i guess im going by myself
robert wakefield sits in business class
he twists the cap off a mini bottle of bourbon and pours it over a cup of ice
he empties a second bottle into the cup then swirls it around on the ice
he takes a sip
robert exits with his briefcase and hanging bag two security men trailing him
he sees barbara and caroline his wife and daughter waiting by the their station wagon
on the way home from the airport
caroline drives carefully with barbara in the front seat and robert in back
whats it like
thinks imagine youre being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta except the beggars are wearing suits and they dont say please or thank you
what about legalizing everything
has anybody talked about that
okay forgetting all of our international trade agreements legalize everything today
the government inserts itself into all drug transactions
becomes a giant pharmacy
our borders are mobbed lines of people from here to europe wanting to smoke snort and shoot themselves into oblivion
lightly like a grateful dead concert
drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world
canada is completely overwhelmed
what if every country legalized at the same time
smiles somehow i dont see that happening
from the hallway we see robert and barbara and caroline having dinner
a family tableau
we hear barbara talking the murmur of the days events
in the room barbara continues her dinner table thoughts
robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the table
so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel none of whom had any expertise
superfund is just one of those words
people stop paying attention
its so frustrating
there is wine on the table and caroline is allowed a glass
her parents watch her take a responsible sip
to robert did you meet the president
honey your father knows the president
as it happens the president of the united states my new boss the leader of the free world has me penciled in for some face time
will we get invited to the white house
i dont know
how longs the job
its a presidential appointment so
until i quit or get fired
czar for life just like a real czar
that makes mom the czarina
im a czarette
caroline thinks about this
none of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual drug czar
caroline sorry but i mean come on
robert doesnt know if shes putting him down
its great daddy
its just amazing thats all
they all look at each other
caroline sips her wine
in the intake area of a busy san diego precinct helena sits on a bench and regroups
detectives move past her
handcuffed criminals are separated bagged and tagged
beautifully dressed man arnie metzger s super lawyer knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom slick but likable smart and ruthless too separates himself from a
detective hes gladhanding and approaches helena
helena im so sorry arnie thank god
metzger sits giving her a hug
can you please tell me what on earth is going on
arnie looks at her as if to say do you really not know
then he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth
you want to know whats going on
why are you talking like that
listen to me carefully
first of all carl isnt here
deas got him and theyll hang on to him until arraignment which will probably be tomorrow
so here youre wasting your time
are you with me
he checks to see if this is registering
from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape recorded that the movement of your lips is being read
arnie this is crazy
he makes eye contact with her
she slowly nods good
do not discuss anything over the telephone
do not talk to the neighbors
stay out of your yard
what is he being charged with
i dont know but under no circumstances would i talk about it here
i want you to go home and relax the best you can
continue your life as if nothing has happened
that is very important
arnie i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass
thats a very apt analogy helena
now go home and be with your children
her expression is set as she drives
she turns a corner in the shopping district passing javier and manolo who are walking down the street
tourists drunk marines and the homeless piss away another day
we follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a discrete sign
this is a place where men come to meet men
and its already lively even at this early hour
javier and manolo find a seat and wait
javi is working on his second beer when he seems to recognize somebody
francisco frankie flowers has entered the bar
javi watches him circulate through the room then settle at the bar
javier finishes his beer rises and takes the empty seat next to francisco
very quickly javi strikes up a conversation
we dont hear what theyre saying but it doesnt matter because francisco clearly likes javi
off franciscos anticipatory smile the back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded francisco falls onto the ground
surrounding him are javi and salazar who watch as two of salazars men drag francisco away toward an abandoned mission style building
clearly pleased with javi im curious how you did this with such economy
everybody has a weakness
with its old growth trees and manipulated shrubbery the large house is shrouded in the mystery of well heeled suburbia
it is very late
somebodys parents are out of town and the house feels empty
big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on
faint music echoes through the house
high ceilings of a s kitchen
vodka bottles and cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter
on the rhodes again by morcheeba plays from a jam box on a counter
maybe ten teenagers are partying hard in this kitchen
its weird and disassociated people wandering in and out playing with kitchen utensils heavily fucked up
there are drugs on a mirror on the eat in table
caroline and seth and two friends sit around this table
vanessa almost pretty is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the hit
fucked up bowman super preppy with a wan baby huey face takes a slug of vodka
they are jittery sweaty tweaked fucked up all im saying what im saying is it never seems like anybody ever says anything that matters to them like we all look
at each other and nod with responses weve been trained to make not real responses just social conventions phony fake smiles surface bullshit
i mean were all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like really like
do i know what seths afraid of or vanessa or fucked up bowman
everyone looks at fucked up bowman who grinds his jaw appreciatively probably but do i ever say this stuff just say hey im uncomfortable in this crowd i dont know
what the fuck im doing either
i know youre afraid and its okay seths words come quickly theyre riffing totally in sync totally wired we act like we have all the answers and were totally invincible
like our parents seem and their parents before them and its fucking bullshit fucked up bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes
for instance for instance i know you jack off thinking about caroline even though youre supposedly in love with vanessa
whatever the fuck that means
a digression i mean what is that convention anyway
were all these random collections of self interest and then we just decide that now were two people walking along caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine and vanessa doesnt
think shes pretty so she does all these weird fucking diets which is totally about self esteem
and shes beautiful
beat and thats not even fair
because listen to me
im fucking lying right now
this is exactly what im talking about
im supposedly talking about you making some big point about you and its really about me
so i should talk about me not you not even the universal you
takes a beat okay
okay im worried im not really smart or that im not nearly as smart as people think i am or that my parents expectations have been way too high since
i was five i mean who knows theyre going to harvard when theyre five not that im blaming them for anything because everythings great and i may not even get in but we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we cant acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we ever say it too and what kind of life will that be
they all look at each other with love
this is an adventure and theyre having a connection i jack off thinking about seth
everybody i know does
bowman does another huge hit of freebase
disgusted ach thats what im talking about
always fucking sarcasm
youre afraid and you think if you admit it people will think youre weak or wont like you we live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to
they all look at each other vibrating with the moment lets be different i cant feel my hands
bowman looks around squinting confused
hes chalk white
im serious suddenly he clutches his chest and begins to twitch
puke and foam come from his mouth
he seizes and falls from the chair
seth and caroline push the table aside to get a better look
other people in the kitchen slowly take notice
he isnt breathing is he breathing
bowmans eyes have rolled back in his head
what do we do
fucked up bowmans turning blue
we need a doctor
your dads a doctor
call him hes a research doctor
youre dads a doctor too what kind of research
mapping the fucking pig genome
well call your dad hes a neurosurgeon its three a
im not supposed to be here
i snuck out are you kidding
im staying with you hes gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor he cant
my parents are in barbados the taurus wagon races up to the emergency room of suburban hospital
the back door opens and bowman tumbles out onto the wheelchair ramp under the fluorescent lights
the car screeches around the circle two officers in a police car see the body tumble out of the car
the cop car wheels around and cuts off the egress of the taurus wagon seth is behind the wheel
caroline and vanessa are in the back
they stare out at the cops getting out of the cruiser
nobody has anything on them right
francisco is strapped naked into a chair
duct tape covers his mouth
his face is bruised and swollen
a cruel torturer talks to him calmly while dumping chili powder into a container of soda water
we know tijuana cartel gunmen killed our chief of intelligence francisco
we know you killed police commanders in tijuana and mexico city
why do you resist
he approaches francisco and begins shaking up the soda water
he rips the tape off his mouth
my father is rich
hell pay you
not the correct answer my friend
the torturer puts another strip of duct tape across franciscos mouth
we know that you went after the neighbor of general salazar a simple alfalfa farmer
his grand daughter was shot
this is stupid behavior francisco
francisco starts to squirm and whimper
the torturer closes one of franciscos nostrils and sprays the pepper laced water into the other nostril
its like a bomb went off in franciscos brain
he screams and passes out
blood and mucous oozes out of his nose
javier stands guard outside a door listening to the strangulated screams of francisco
manolo ignores franciscos cries while shooting the shit with several of salazars men who laugh appreciatively at something hes said
valet parkers in uniform work the driveway
the party is ablaze and there are lights in the trees
a lester lanin like band plays a standard that drifts across the grounds
a conservative monied crowd mingles
helena is talking with a group of rich people who include her friends nan stewie and alex from the country club and their husbands
this is fabulous helena
what a turnout
thank you so much but i had a lot of help
helena circles away
as helena leaves the women speak their minds its a turnout because its a spectacle
can you imagine
ive met her husband as nice as they come
it teaches me a valuable lesson
re the nice house apparently crime pays
silly you knew that already
the band stops playing and steps aside as a man in a tuxedo takes the microphone
behind the band is a huge a
adult literacy advocates banner
thank you all
i have the results of the silent auction
caroline wakefield lies on a bench in a grey walled holding cell
she wears paper slippers and her belt has been removed
even youth cant disguise her hangover
caroline is perched on the edge of her chair
across the desk from her is a tired social worker s who has been assigned carolines case and is giving her the exit interview
how old are you
sixteen live with your parents
parents still together
do you work
i read to blind people
one day a week for two hours
cincinnati country day
the social worker looks up from her questionnaire and sees caroline for the first time
how are your grades
im third in my class
whats that mean
i get as
what else you do
her college resume im a national merit finalist
im on the hi q team and the math team
im in the spanish club
im a thespian
im vice president of my class
im on the volleyball team
the social worker pushes the forms shes filling out away and looks again at caroline you wanna tell me what youre doing here caroline
a cold institutional lobby with hard plastic chairs and bad lighting
government workers move behind thick glass windows with tiny mesh screens cut into them for talking
barbara wakefield sits on one of the uncomfortable chairs
shes alone and has been crying
theres the sound of heavily locked doors opening and caroline appears
barbara stands and wraps caroline in her arms
are you all right
caroline begins to cry into her mothers chest
its an early morning as barbara wakefield escorts her daughter from the bland government building
did you tell dad
are you going to
i dont know
is this bad for him
what do you think
the streets are deserted
their saab wagon sits forlornly under grey skies in an uncovered public parking lot
helena slips into davids room and quietly watches him sleep
still wearing her evening gown helena collapses into a chair exhausted
a tap at the door startles her
its arnie metzger who goes to the bar and pours himself a strong one
they sit opposite each other and neither speaks for a while
quietly i am on the board of my sons school
i had a fundraiser for a
in my front yard
i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman
of course he is
ive known him for twenty years and he doesnt jaywalk
helena is relieved but shes not looking at arnie and when she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive no
arnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows and shuts the blinds one by one
carl is a very important member of this community and when were through suing the police and the district attorney and the dea theyll have to rename the public parks
for your husband
the blinds are closed
arnie crosses to helena and talks very softly in her ear
shes a beautiful woman and arnie manages to make this act seem both practical and inappropriate
whispering your husband is very good at his job
helena leans back and looks at arnie
he whispers more which is smuggling illegal drugs into this country
workers break down the party under the watchful eye of the party planner
the neighborhood is quiet
there is a telephone repair van parked up the street
castro and gordon have visual and audio equipment trained on the ayala home
they both wear headsets
gordons pov the blinds covering helenas study glowing peacefully
i cant hear them but i know it
i smell conspiracy
i feel the lie vibrating out of the home
she aint in on it
i have dreams about this actual dreams about busting the top people the rich people the white people
im telling you she doesnt know shit
she knows arnie metzger
so does half of san diego
you want to make a wager on this
the music is still playing
helena looks numb
she motions arnie to her
he leans in
if all our assets are frozen and our sales force has scattered
how am i supposed to survive
im giving birth in three months
how do i get through this
youre gonna get through it but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl
we get adler and we beat this thing
how much do i pay him
i suspect hell accept his payment in publicity
a large well maintained colonial on mockingbird valley road an upper middle class neighborhood in the wealthy east end of cincinnati
leaves fall on the saab wagon in the driveway
robert is looking at caroline and hes not happy
barbara is there at a neutral distance from both of them
how well did you know this boy who overdosed
she looks up beseechingly
he didnt hang around us
hes like one of those hippie kids
im not part of that group
it was a party in all these rooms
his girlfriend who i barely know was completely hysterical
hes blue hes puking
we didnt want to get in trouble but what were we supposed to do
beat i mean what would you have done if you had been us
how well do you know this boy seth who was driving
you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana
hes a friend
hes also like the only one who was dealing with the situation
hed definitely had a few beers but its not like he wanted to drive
we didnt know what else to do
beat it wasnt my pot
she searches her parents faces
it has been a convincing performance and she expects victory
youre mother and i have to talk
caroline is confused by this reaction
honey wed like to talk alone
caroline stands abruptly like always
caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than necessary
robert and barbara look at each other raising their eyebrows and breathing deeply i think shes lying
reaching a decision well ground her clip her wings a bit
school and scheduled activities and thats it until further notice
this has to be handled delicately
dan kelly in the district attorneys office will probably help us out quietly
christ this could be embarrassing
honey this is difficult but weve all had our moments
i tried stop
you experimented in college
i dont want to hear about that
should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is
this is different
to begin with shes only sixteen years old
i think she has to find out for herself on her own
we have to allow her space space for what
like that other kid
i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents
because it isnt
we dont want to push her away
these are growing experiences
robert looks at his wife then it dawns on him
how long have you known about this
yelling how long have you known
i found some marijuana thats all
and a little pipe about two inches long
i talked with her
she said her friends smoked pot and drank explain to me how you could think that i shouldnt know about this
explain to me how this wouldnt be relevant to me
as a parent
she asked me not to
he leaves the room
robert is in the hallway at carolines door
he opens it and we get blasted with music
caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on
she faces the window and moves back and forth back and forth
robert calls her name but the soundtrack is drowning him out
he calls again this time apparently loud enough for her to hear
she takes the headphones off the music stops and turns to look at him
or rather she looks right through him as though he didnt exist
robert is so taken aback by the coldness of her gaze that he doesnt speak
she turns away from him and puts the headphones back on
javier and salazar walk across the base
salazar is feeling ebullient and it shows
you watch and learn
i earn his trust
then more pain
then i appear with kindness
within a week he will follow me around like a dog
but will he be house trained
when he loves me like a father he will never tell anyone he was here
he will freely give the names of his superiors
then we get them and they too will give us names
and eventually somebody will get us to juan obregon and the cartel will fall
they enter the barracks
its pitch black in the cell
theres a human in here but we cant see him
suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in illuminating a very broken francisco flores
the figure of commander salazar fills the doorway
this is shameful
francisco flores francisco cowers in the corners its all right son
its all right
salazar is here
youre among gentlemen now
this shameful treatment will stop immediately
calling out guard
a guard appears in the doorway
francisco is spooked
i want to know who is responsible for this treatment
we arent barbarians
bring this man a change of good clothes
has he eaten
i dont know sir
to francisco you will dine with me from now on
francisco moves closer to salazar already feeling safe in his presence
a packed courthouse
carl is at the defense table
he doesnt look at helena who sits in the gallery next to arnie metzger
the prosecutor is finishing his argument this is a man who heads a large criminal organization with international contacts we can only begin to understand
our case against him is very strong
he is not a flight risk
his flight is assured
the people ask that your honor denies bail
the prosecutor sits
carls defense lawyer michael adler from the georgetown party stands and speaks
my client is no more a flight risk than your honor or the able prosecutor
he is a pillar of his community a family man with a wife and child in la jolla the community where he has made his home for over twenty years
as our defense will quickly show my client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an admitted criminal
therefore we ask that you release carl ayala on his own recognizance
the judge makes a quick decision
im gonna deny bail
the judge slams his gavel
the crowd is on its feet
carl tries to get a glimpse of helena
they make eye contact
reporters from the press gallery are yelling for helena
arnie ushers her away
adler arnie and helena push through a crowd toward her car
there are several reporters there who ask questions mrs
ayala were you aware your husband is the largest cocaine smuggler in america
alleged people alleged
helena gets into her car and slams the door
adler faces the reporters
ayala is it true your husband has ordered a hit on eduardo ruiz
adler is in a role he relishes
helena drives away
we move up to gordon who is watching from the hotel window across the street
he speaks into a walkie talkie and a car down below pulls out to follow helena
carl ayala sits on the board of the childrens hospital
he is heavily involved with adult literacy
he has a small boy and another child on the way
if you spread this kind of innuendo you can expect legal recourse
are we clear on this point
the marble government corridors are empty
no one is in yet
one office has lights on
robert wakefield talks with an assistant district attorney dan kelly s
i appreciate you coming in so early
judge wakefield its an honor to handle it for you
consider it gone away
shes a minor it probably wouldve expunged on her th birthday anyway
still this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally
like i said open container p
easy to make it disappear
for you poof its gone
kelly thinks a moment then tries for tact
one thing bothers me
that kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him
hes lucky he lived
so i gotta ask whats your daughter on
i dont know what you mean
i mean did you ask her
what kind of drugs has she tried
robert is silent for a beat
i dont really know
is she in any kind of therapy
no of course not
shes one of the top students at her school
well i hope it stays that way
robert in his car thinking
the streets are empty
he picks up the cell phone
into phone its robert
wipe your schedule clean for the next three days
im tired of talking to experts who never set foot outside the beltway
its time to see the front lines
caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom
shes not going to the bathroom its a seat and shes wearing her pajamas
shes reading a magazine
the exhaust fan is on
there are pictures of her and her friends on the walls goofy pictures from camp from school a collage shes made with cutouts from magazine pictures and copy
on the sink next to her is a little square of well charred aluminum foil shes done many hits
she leans over and picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in her soap dish
she drops it on a clean place on the foil
she picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen shes turned into a straw
she heats the bottom of the foil
the crack crackles
she chases the smoke across the foil
a huge hit
she leans her head back her eyes roll back she tries to focus on the magazine on anything she stares up at the ceiling
she holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the exhaust fan
caroline looks at her watch
she stands suddenly unsteadily
she looks at herself in the mirror
shes really high and indecisive
she looks around wildly
she sees the shower
she turns it on
she drops her pajamas
she goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock taking another really big hit
she crushes the foil and flushes it down the toilet
she hops in the shower
the water streams over her face
after a long beat she finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and steam
shes in ecstacy
its almost time to leave for school
helena reads a book madame bovary by gustave flaubert and keeps an eye on david who is playing on the monkey bars
across the road at a careful distance is the ubiquitous telephone repair van
on the roof a parabolic mike swivels around
castro and gordon watch helena via a small surveillance monitor
you should see little montel play
little montel is the next maradona
maradona is a cokehead
hand of god my ass
were wasting our time here
he was a winner
that bothers you
winners dont do coke
or havent you been reading the bumper stickers
gordon looks at the monitor what do we have here
david kicking a soccer ball with an older strange man tigrillo latino s fit and tough looking
the man is very good
he juggles the ball and bounces it off his head and david follows him away from the center of the playground
helena notices david moving away while playing with the man
she follows then begins to jog after them
david come back here this minute
as she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and abruptly picks up david and begins swinging him around by his arms
david is having fun as helena approaches
david were playing
the strange man swings david up so that hes under his arm
yeah this is fun
please put down my son
the man holds david
shouldnt let your kid wander off with strangers
thats a valuable lesson
david come on
the strange man holds david tighter so that hes no longer having fun
he begins to wriggle mrs
ayala this gets her attention your husband owes a lot of money
enough that snapping this kids neck wouldnt nearly cover it
david begins to cry
helena looks around wildly for help
you better come up with it in a hurry or your kid is going to disappear and he wont turn up until the evening news
he drops david who runs to his mother
you get exactly one warning
the strange man moves away across the field
the first payment is three million dollars
he continues walking away
gordon and castro stare with rapt attention
are you getting this on tape
i love my job
i love it
the next time im having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and ill get over it
javier and manolo stand guard outside the front door of the dining hall
javi smokes a cigarette
a group of us are going out tonight
guzman tomas esteban your new friends
it should be fun
you wanna come
not this time
francisco and salazar eat at a beautifully set table
they are waited on by military officers who serve perfect flan at the end of the meal
in my home i have b w speakers
i recently purchased a compact disc burner
i can make my own cds with whatever music i like as if i bought them at the store only i dont have to pay these crazy prices
we have much in common
we both attended school in the united states and both of our fathers are engineers
i got into stereo equipment when i was a kid
some people dont notice the difference but it is very important to me
of course it is
have some more wine
a soldier pours another glass of red for francisco
now francisco my friend
i must know where these men are who killed my captains
not where they were last week but where they are today and better still tomorrow
you are clever
you can predict where they will be cant you
francisco begins to weep
salazar slides a pad of paper toward francisco who slowly begins writing
manolo and javier pound on the front door of an apartment
a man opens the door and they grab him
a man walks down the street
two suvs pull up in front of him
he starts to run
salazars men jump out and chase him
francisco is in the backseat of one of the suvs watching
an suv pulls up to a curb
javier and manolo and francisco sit in the suv
francisco is weeping
i cant go home
i dont want to go
please dont make me
he looks beseechingly at them
its not our decision
ill be killed
nobody knows what youve been up to
they push him out of the suv
castro and gordon sit with eduardo ruiz in a conference room
they are recording his statements
carlos i mean carl started out in the family connection business real estate in tijuana fishing boats out of ensenada hydroponic raspberries
he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things entering society and using his fishing boats
so you pay off our customs officials
in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity this is not so true for the usa
condescending using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search
the odds are not high and we found variables that reduce the odds
we hire drivers with nothing to lose
then we throw a lot of product at the problem
some get stopped
enough get through
its not difficult
youd think he wasnt sitting here facing life in prison
this has worked for years and it will continue to work for years
nafta makes everything more difficult for you
the border is disappearing
pointing at them you people are like those japanese soldiers left behind on deserted islands who think that world war ii is still going on
with total disdain let me be the first to tell you your government surrendered this war a long time ago
to castro this attitudes not gonna help him any is it
i got greedy
i decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off
that was my mistake
carl would never be so stupid
he hired you
that was a mistake
carl and i were friends from childhood
he was loyal thats not a mistake
car after car an unending multi lane stream of vehicles moving into the u
any of these cars could be carrying drugs
on an elevated walkway this booth commands a view of everything
robert and sheridan listen to an official give the spiel
the busiest land border crossing in the world
over forty one thousand vehicles per day twenty two thousand pedestrians on foot
i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through
any idea how much
ive read official estimates but i wouldnt bet my house on them
ive heard the entire cocaine supply for the united states can fit into four tractor trailers
gestures to the traffic at least a half dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope with drivers employed by people who dont give a
damn if theyre caught or not
what do you look for
we ask questions and measure the answers
when something doesnt ring true a fact that doesnt make sense a slight hesitation then its off to secondary for a closer look
before nafta we had about
million trucks a year
now its almost double
pretty soon therell be mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as american truck companies
any way we can do it better
more money in intelligence on their side of the border
so we have a better idea who were looking for
supposed to be getting some giant x ray machines to run the trucks through
outside of martial law thats about the best youre gonna do
beat but i should tell you there are two things that really have us on edge right now
beat in the last six months seizures have tripled even though were pulling over the same number of cars
what does that tell you
that triple the amount of stuff is going through
but thats not the biggest problem
one of our intel officers picked up information from dea that traffickers have come up with a process a chemical process to turn coke into something else
it doesnt smell like coke
it doesnt look like coke
and whats worse it doesnt react to field test
it could be anything
maybe its already happening
i mean how would we know
robert looks out at the border activity
helena is on the floor surrounded by papers
shes made piles of certain things articles of incorporation shipping transfer documentation bank statements credit card statements
she holds a telephone to her ear to phone yes hi jenny account number
i need a cash advance
helena walks into her kitchen
its serene in the afternoon light
she fixes ice cold lemonade and fills two plastic cups
whats the largest amount i can get
listens okay i guess thatll have to do
helena hangs up the phone
she takes the two cups of lemonade to the front door and steps outside
helena carries the cups down the driveway
she presses a button and the gates swing open
gordon and castro listen to their headsets
suddenly over their headsets okay
shes coming out
shes leaving her property
okay she seems to be heading for the van
she is approaching the van
castro and gordon looks at each other

theres a knocking at the door of the van
what do you think she wants
shes your girlfriend

gordon opens the door
helena is standing there with the lemonade
i so hope i didnt startle you
i thought you might like some cold lemonade
she hands the cups to him
helena gathers herself
i know this is a difficult situation and youre only doing your jobs
i dont bear you any ill will but i do have a small favor to ask
you want to ask us a favor
a man threatened my children
these charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be bringing all the nut jobs out of the nut jar
beat would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary
i dont know what else to do
of course we will
they shut the door to the van and sit for a moment
its probably poisoned
gordon takes a big sip of his
not too sweet
this is a questionable neighborhood pushed up against the edge of poverty
anna hurries across the street
anna walks up the stairs of a rundown building
she passes two prostitutes loitering in the stairwell
she knocks on a door and javi half dressed for work answers
hes surprised to see her
what do you want
i cant find manolo
hes not here
he never came home last night
was he with you
he lets her into the apartment
a small clean room with a partition for the sleeping area
last time he was out late i went through his clothes while he was asleep
she pulls out a plastic packet with the scorpion insignia and stamped on it
javier thinks a beat
ill find him
javi slams manolo against the side of building
what the fuck are you doing
youre supposed to be at work
look at you
manolo is sweaty and crazy eyed
its no problem
i was just with everybody we work with
general salazar was there
no but a lot of other people
you should come
you should come out with us
get cleaned up
get to work
salazar is heading down to mexico city next week and im not getting left behind
dont fuck this up
javi buys a cup of coffee
two men who will come to be known as agent hughes and agent johnson are standing close
agent hughes speaks without looking at him
the word going around is youre not that happy in your work
beat maybe we can help
hughes sticks a business card in javis pocket
javi watches them walk away
its all done so smoothly and quickly its over before javi even knows what happened
its the bad part of urban cincinnati in the daylight projects and blighted row houses
seth and caroline walk with a slouched alert air
in their minds eye they are prep school gangsters following a familiar route
you know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day
he and my mom have cocktail hour every night from six to seven set your clock two bourbons maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them
to unwind yeah then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day
have you done your homework honey
yes mom then heres a little bump
they turn down a street with a lot of activity on it
drugs werent even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem
but who was using em
and the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju ju music
people on the fringe
decadent rich people
and who got scared
white men in power
whos scared today
white men in power
morgan and john d
rockefeller ever admitted using itd be a whole different story
two young street dealers fall in step with them
one talks without moving his lips what you want
and the come down
one dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling down building
two hundred of c hundred of the other
the dealer looks them over
he looks behind them down the street
weve been here before
then lets see your money
seth and caroline are suspicious
they carefully show money they both have in their front right pockets
the dealer feints like he might grab it
up the steps
you the experts
you know what to do
they hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone
they step into the narrow foyer between the outer door and the inner door
there are three other people waiting nervously
an older junkie shoots them a crazy look what are you two about twelve
finally the first dealer appears in the inner door and lets them through
they wait in a line in the narrow poorly lit corridor
at the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the drugstore is open
people buy and leave
seth and caroline approach
in the hatch is a hardened dealer s named sketch which is tattooed on his forearm
he checks out carolines body
caroline give me your money
she hands over her money to seth who pays and gets the drugs gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and and wax paper bindles of heroin also labeled
caroline has been watching the transaction
sketch makes slow eye contact with caroline
after a beat goodbye
seth and caroline make their way out of the building
under his breath yeah right
seth and caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps
the lookout speaks without moving his lips
now get the fuck out of here
caroline stops suddenly
she pulls seth to her and kisses him hard
theres no better moment than the one right after scoring before you start using
a flophouse of the seediest variety wino in the doorway prostitute taking care of business everyone fresh out of institutions and graveyards
they approach the front desk which is behind six inches of glass
wed like room
then you hand me twenty eight dollars
they enter and the light bulb goes out
seth fumbles his way to the mini fridge which he opens throwing feeble light across the floor
they check out the decrepit room the sloping mattress the black and white television bolted to the bureau
the mini fridge
caroline bounces on the bed
they are teenagers
seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini fridge
i love this place
seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table
from other pockets he extracts aluminum foil lighter tube
she trails away watching him fix the first hit
did courtney love play nancy in syd and nancy
i think so
if she didnt she should have
checks her watch ive only got maybe an hour
then volleyball practice is over and i have to be home
he prepares the first hit
she does it and lies back
he does one
blowing out the hit the maid
they ask her what time i get back
she spies for them
seth starts kissing her
they try to get into it but both of them are thinking about the drugs
i wish we could stay here
just be here forever and ever
make it a little home
she leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin
i want to have sex and do a hit right as were coming
carolines distracted by the line shes snorting
after a while
seth begins undoing her jeans
robert and sheridan listen to the official tour of the epic center delivered by the special agent in charge a sincere weight lifter with a sincere crew cut
over dea field agents a budget of almost million dollars and state of the art communications equipment make the el paso information center the drug enforcement administrations flagship for the
a huge lunchroom
long plastic institutional tables and agents minding their own business robert sheridan and their epic guide walk through
they pass a wall of black and white head shots who are these guys
agents who died in the field
of large mansion with manicured grounds
the back lawn is filled with children balloons a merry go round and pony rides
its a sumptuous childrens birthday party
that house that you see from the dea headquarters belonged to porfirio madrigal the lord of the skies largest trafficker in mexico
looking through the binoculars
he died in a liposuction surgery right
now its used by somebody from the juarez cartel one of his lieutenants
beat every damn day theres birthday party
at first i thought they must have three hundred children then i realized theyre taunting us
three miles away and we cant touch them
ha ha ha
binocular pov a child running in circles holding a clutch of colored balloons
who do we interface with on their side
what do you mean
i mean who runs interdiction on the mexico side
i dont know
i dont think theres any one person
thinks see the problem is the juarez cartel owns everything and everybody all the property on the mexican side sometimes all the property on both sides
warehouses transportation even tunnels
its very organized
robert walking with purpose leads his group to their plane
robert and sheridan and several dea law enforcement and military officials
its a nice plane used for important people and robert has the best seat
i want everyone thinking out the box for a second
what are we gonna do about mexico
silence come on guys
out of the box
the men on the plane just stare at him
finally the rep from dea leans forward
from a dea standpoint we need a vetted task force and matching funds
and cut the red tape on getting them equipment and training
robert turns to the others
i want to hear from everyone fbi
is there anyone from treatment on this plane
no one answers then i want an answer for why there isnt anyone from treatment
beat look we know we have to bust one of these cartels juarez or tijuana not just as a symbol but hell yes also as a symbol they are symbols
and theres nothing wrong with sending a message
thats why when carlos ayala hired michael adler lead defense i flew ben williams to san diego to prosecute
because hes the best we have hes our symbol that were serious about putting the top people away
beat so as of right now this flight only consider the dam on new ideas thrown open
still no one else says anything
they watch robert impassively
if im not mistaken we got dea pentagon u
attorneys office about a billion dollars of budget right here
so what are you people waiting for
establishing shot of a tall glass building in the downtown skyline of san diego
helena and arnie enter his office
the furniture is sleek mid century modern and the view of the harbor is extraordinary
on a clear day you can see mexico city
arnie stands very close to helena and looks at her profile
this place is swept twice a day
i learned that in miami in
then the u
shut down the whole caribbean but its a big game of wack a mole
knock it down in miami it pops up here
and san diego is so much more relaxing
arnie i need money
somebody threatened my children
they want a first payment of three million dollars
helena if i had it i would give it to you but i dont have that kind of money
arnie help me
doesnt anyone owe us money
yes i told you before there are people who owe you money but theyre not paying
theres too much heat on carl
tell me who carl sells to
even if i knew i wouldnt tell you
you do not want to come into contact with these people
only carl knows who they are
thats his real asset
ruiz doesnt know them
they dont know ruiz
church and state
what about legitimate businesses
we own a construction concern real estate laundromats for the washing of money
unfortunately carl had only one successful business
dont you have some good news
isnt there something positive you could say
helena looks arnie in the eyes
vulnerable sometimes i wonder what ill do if carl doesnt get out
im not very adept at being on my own
ive always had a man in my life
i remember when i first met you little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere
i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed
im glad you think so but im picturing a debt ridden thirty two year old mother whose ex husband is being compared to pablo escobar
beat and im wondering who would want to be with someone like that
it takes a great effort for arnie not to answer
javier and manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in mexico city
javi isnt familiar with the roads and drives cautiously
a young lady rosario early s sexy and vulnerable rides in the back of the suv
you two dont like me do you
manolo laughs and looks her up and down
javi watches her in the rearview mirror
we dont have an opinion on you
to javi maybe its because im getting an apartment nicer than anything youll ever see in your life
javi says nothing
re the neighborhood i cant believe the old man kept his promise
the general is a man of his word
they will say anything to get what they want but then you remind them its always tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow
beat occupational hazard i guess
javi just looks at her in the rearview mirror
his friend is giving us the apartment so its not like he paid
its more like a favor
javier pulls the suv to the curb in front of a beautiful colonial style apartment complex in the verdant neighborhood
birds are chirping
javi waits in the car as manolo takes the young ladys bags from the vehicle and carries them up the walkway to the arched doorway
he knocks on the heavy wooden door
you dont have the keys
oh thats perfect
are you an idiot
manolo knocks again
they wait a long beat
theres supposed to be someone here to let you in
finally the door swings open and a bodyguard is standing there
rosario squeals and sweeps past him into the vast space
the bodyguard motions for manolo to put the bags inside the door
manolo sets the bags down and sees another man standing a few feet away
the man wears sunglasses
his complexion is strange and his neck is bandaged
the body guard escorts manolo back outside where he hears rosarios happy laughter drifting down from an upstairs window
manolo gets into the truck
hes shaken by what hes just seen
porfirio madrigal is not dead
i just saw him
a long beat as javier considers this
this is why salazar is so interested in cleaning up tijuana
madrigal whos supposed to be dead owns him
and madrigal is making a move on juan obregon
javier calmly drives away
dont pull this you dont care bullshit
this is incredible information
it must be
javi we keep our mouths shut
barbara drives robert home from the airport
theres a sense theyve been silent for a while
i think we may have found our mexican drug czar
its this general salazar
at least ill have somebody on the other side i can talk to
does this mean youre going to be gone more
a long silence
you might want to pencil in a little face time with your daughter
barbara because im at the edge of my capabilities robert
the first thing we have to do is present a unified front
if you start in on the war metaphors im going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole
look im as worried as you are no i dont think so
leave me alone give me money
thats what i get from our daughter
she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar
yeah well she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar too
she looks at him stung
im not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello
i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day
oh it is
yeah because the alternative is to be bored to death
he car pulls into the driveway
robert gets out
he looks back at her
why dont you go in and tell your daughter how bored you are
she puts the car in reverse and drives away
he stands for a moment steaming
robert wakefield steps inside his home
its very quiet
he checks the mail on the hall table
robert walks down the hallway
he steps into carolines bedroom
robert stands outside her closed bathroom door
there is nothing then from the other side of the door the faint sound of a lighter clicking
again and again then a caroline sits on the toilet
glamour magazine on her lap
shes wild eyed and paranoid
the exhaust fan is running
the aluminum foil is on the sink
the last little bit of heroin in a wax paper bundle sits beside it
shes listening hard for any sound in the house
what shes wondering is if someone is outside the door listening
she puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it
she does the hit
and seems to feel better
suddenly theres a pounding on the door
the voice of her father muffled through the solid wood
muffled by the door caroline
open this door immediately
caroline is up like a shot
she looks around
the pounding on the door gets stronger
she crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet
the bathroom door sounds like its about to cave inward
faking the best she can who is it
im going to the bathroom
shes coping now full parallel process mode she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches
for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air
she takes the remaining crack lighters tubes little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet
she pauses a beat then opens the door and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes
excuse me robert grabs her by the arms
he pushes her against the wall and looks at her pupils
he looks at her fingernails
the blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and irritated
youre not going anywhere young lady
she stands there shes very high
robert sniffs the air
he throws open cabinets searching for drugs
he sees the smudge mark on the counter left by the charred aluminum foil
where is it
where are the drugs
yelling where are they
i wasnt doing anything
youre like the gestapo
robert kicks the cabinets
robert is losing it
he throws stuff around the bathroom and then for the first time looks up
he sees the long light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on him
im going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that i can help you
she just stares
okay young lady thats it
like i give a fuck
robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a charred spoon
it confuses him
he throws it into the sink
he pulls out another spoon
he pulls out crumpled bindles rolled up encrusted dollar bills exhausted lighters a pill bottle an empty pint of vodka
the detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming filling up the sink
robert stares at it the amount and complexity has him momentarily baffled
what is wrong with you
beat youre going away
youre getting help somewhere
you cant make me
oh yes i can
javier drinks toward downtown
hes sipping a burger king soft drink
on the seat next to him is a shopping bag from target
he takes an exit
javier pulls into the underground parking lot of a fancy office tower
javi drives down to the third floor underground
he pulls into a parking spot next to a white sedan
he slides open the cargo door of his van
the cargo door of the sedan opens
javi quickly gets into the sedan
special agents hughes and johnson welcome javi
where are we going
hughes sticks out his hand
special agent hughes drug enforcement administration of the united states
ignoring the niceties where are you taking me
the agents exchange a look
a place we have that we know is protected
its really safe
not for me
where would you like to go
javi and agents johnson and hughes stand in the middle of the shallow end of a large swimming pool
kids in waterwings splash nearby
its important that we work together
one hand washing the other
maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations
confused by this we thought maybe youd have that kind of information for us
feigning surprise this is a very different proposition
johnson and hughes exchange a glance
we pay for that kind of information
a fat kid in an inner tube floats behind them
is that what youre talking about javier
javi makes eye contact with one agent then the other
ten years ago tijuana had no drug problem
now it is epidemic
beat ten years ago america takes a hammer to pablo escobar a hammer to the miami drug trade and you allowed everything to move to my country
you dumped the problem at our feet
now drug use is epidemic
now the treatment centers are full and get no state money
they survive on donations and what they get for building doghouses to sell to the beat we need lights for the parks so kids can play at night
so they can play baseball
so its safe
everybody likes parks
everybody likes baseball
beat what im talking about is i would like to see somebody take an interest in tijuana
thats what im talking about
javi starts to get out of the pool
javi you want to come see us again youre going on the box
no more of this water wing bullshit
javier gets out of the dea sedan and back into his
he drives away
agents hughes turns to agent johnson
you wanna tell me what the hell that was all about
hes got something
we just have to be patient
helena and carl each hold a telephone receiver as they stare at each other through a thick pane of meshed glass
helena is barely holding it together
its hard for carl to see her like this
after a beat hows david
hes terrific carl
helena we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents
i dont even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when youre coming back
or if youre coming back
she cant even look at him
beat well get through this i promise
ill make it up to you snapping how
supportive letters from prison while im being kicked out of our home
beat do you have any idea what is happening out here
our credit cards are maxed
the people at the bank you should see their faces when i walk in there
i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien
our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging
nobody will help us
nobody will take us in
nobody wants anything to do with us
so tell me carl how youre gonna make it up to me
losing it tell me again how well get through this and maybe while youre at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a
tender moment of connection
helena tell me what to do carl
i need guidance not a fucking platitude
beat im not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with
i wont do it
i want our life back
carl looks at his wife as if he is trying to weigh her
he thinks then leans forward i built our house and i dont want to lose it
every stone every brick every board
carefully my business
that would take a lot of private study
he blinks that you dont have time for
i suggest you look into the coronel
he blinks again into selling it
if you can stomach it you should look into it
that painting is very valuable
i dont understand
look into the coronel otherwise there is nothing to do
a peaceful wooded campus with a unobtrusive sign reading serenity oaks treatment facility
there are sayings on the wall easy does it let go and let god turn it over one day at a time
caroline wearing a thick woolly sweater and the other patients sit around on beat up couches and chairs in a loose circle
its a mixed bunch trucker meth head rocker dope fiend yuppie crack head fat thin rich middle class and all white
caroline is the youngest
marty s an overweight alcoholic finishes his share
so it was my birthday an my ex wife was getting remarried and i was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day
because i didnt have to eat out of a dumpster
that was enough to send me out on big one
beat ive been thinking a lot about the first step that i came to believe i was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable
beat see my disease tells me i dont have a disease
that im fine
that its my birthday and i can have one little drink then one little line then one little valium then two more fat lines then two more mil valium
six months later i wake up in a sober living house in philly
and im from dallas people
beat its a disease an allergy of the body and an obsession of the mind
i know that now
so my names marty and today im a grateful recovering alcoholic who didnt eat out of a dumpster
and marty looks to caroline who didnt relate to one word he said
slowly very nervous hi
im not sure im an alcoholic
beat i mean i dont really like to drink
for someone my age its so much easier to get drugs than beer
i dont know this is really weird and im really nervous
people in the room nod encouragingly
i guess im angry
i mean i think im really angry about a lot of stuff but i dont know what exactly
she blushes and stares out the window
helena follows an art appraiser through her formal living room as he inspects paintings and makes notations
he is very excited and moves quickly from one to the next
a simply wonderful collection of mexican modern
give me three months
i know several collectors in south america very discreet
i dont have three months
it takes time to find the proper collection
how much will you give me in cash
the appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows the figure to helena
you must be joking
thats a fraction of their value
im sorry but that is the figure i can get today
helena turns her back
she walks to a window and looks out then surveys the contents of her beautiful home
snapping get out
get out of my house
helena turns and sees david in the doorway
she goes to him
its all right
were have a disagreement thats all
the art appraiser passes them on his way out
helena wakes up in the middle of the night with a start
her eyes are wide open
she has had a thought she climbs out of bed and quickly puts on a robe
helena walks quickly and quietly down the hallway
she passes davids room
she opens a door at the end of the hall helena enters the room
she hits a desk lamp and were in a very comfortable and masculine upstairs study bookshelves holding hundreds of art books comfortable chairs macintosh stereo discreet flatscreen hd tv
helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves
it is boy with a hoop a small portrait by rafael colonel
she goes to it and looks from different angles
she reaches out and jiggles the oil
she looks behind the painting at the backing
she notices that one corner is not glued down
she picks up a letter opener and pries the paper back
an envelope slips out
inside the envelope neat thin strips of paper dense with information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card
robert and sheridan ride in the back of the chopper
each looks out his own window
a newspaper on the seat between them shows a front page photo of general salazar exultant and the headline reads in spanish salazar named chief of anti narcotics operations
establishing shot of a military helicopter landing on the roof of an office building in downtown mexico city
robert wakefield and general salazar stroll through the new headquarters where boxes are still being unpacked
javier and sheridan trail along behind them
i recruited the best men in mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process
not only physical but also psychological
id like to bring you up to washington walk you around our side of things and share some of the information weve been able to develop on your cartels
that would be very helpful to me
beat also i received the offer from dea and the fbi to train some of my men at quantico
i think this will be extremely useful a good way for us to absorb some of your methods
the office hasnt been decorated yet
ive been too busy to completely settle in
salazar proffers a chair and they sit next to each other like brezhnev and nixon
photographers begin snapping pictures
after a few moments salazar waves them away and they lower their cameras and leave
youve been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel
yes i am confident that juan obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year
but you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force
we get a tip that he is one place then we get there and he is already gone having been warned by someone on our side
hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem
yes i hope so as well
let me ask you a related question
weve talked about the supply side but what about demand
what is your policy for treating addiction
addicts treat themselves
they overdose and then theres one less to worry about
robert cannot respond
caroline ambles alone down a walkway at the treatment facility
she looks through the trees that surround facility and notices cars going by
gordon and another dea agent escort ruiz up the stairs of a large older hotel
this is ridiculous
why is there no elevator
when the dea gets into the narcotics business then well stay at the four seasons
they walk down a hotel hallway
two more agents stand outside room
gordon opens the door and they enter
there are more agents inside and old food and coffee containers
gordon gives ruiz a tour
there are several rooms
a bored castro sits at a table staring at a scrabble board
eddie how you like your new home
i hope you hate it as much as i do
ruiz looks around with disgust
hes accustomed to finer places
he goes to a window and looks out
ruizs pov of the federal court building not far away
this is not what my lawyers negotiated
gordon pours himself a cup of coffee
fuck your lawyers
you arent getting any cappuccino or biscotti either
a packed tense courtroom listens to testimony from a government witness frank s very matter of fact and truthful
he first came to me in january
that wouldve been nineteen eighty seven
he wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor
i didnt ask too many questions im a businessman also
another witness mrs
berry s pedantic on the stand i told mr
ayala there were irregularities in his tax return
and i couldnt represent him unless we could explain this
sheila a mousy secretary is on the stand
carlos sits at the defendants table listening raptly
gordon and castro sit in the back watching helena who pays close attention to the witness i was the company secretary from to
i supposedly worked for all six companies
i mean it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone
we never sold anything the whole time i was there
sometimes people came and got paid
i dont really know what we did
ayala say where the money came from
no and i didnt ask
where do you think it came from
carls lawyer adler is on his feet this speculation ill rephrase
did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise
sheila is reluctant to answer
no not really
helena catches carls eye and they share a grim moment
helena sits at carls office desk
on the desk in front of her are the lists she found and an encrypted cell phone
helena picks up the phone
her hands are shaking
she is crying as she dials
a voice on the other end answers
who is this
helena gathers her courage then
of carlos ayala
there is a long pause
im on a special phone may i speak freely
you may speak
i have a job for you and i dont have much time
helena watches david look at the wide variety of plants and flowers
all around them a group of rd graders in identical t shirts enjoy a field trip
i love this place
dont turn around
behind her francisco flores takes a photo with an instant camera
you were followed by the police but they wont hear us over the children
i want to use a bomb
cant you shoot him or something
i dont really like guns
you shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive
when will you do it
i dont know
eduardo ruiz is the only real witness against carl
the security is very tight
there may not be a way
theres always a way
if people get to the pope or the president you can get to him
youre sounding like your husband mrs
anna sits in the living room staring
she appears too upset to speak
the apartment is cleaner
there have been other changes
theres a new rug
what is it
its very hard for me to come and tell you this
javier just watches her
hes going to do something stupid
im worried that hell get himself killed
he keeps watching
hes saying hes going to talk to the americans
become an informer
he says they pay a lot of money
why does he need money
he has debts
he has gambling debts
he owes a lot of money
nine thousand dollars
a long beat
what is he planning on telling them
well you know hes going to say about madrigal
javier just looks at her
robert is on the telephone listening
he is not happy
sheridan watches him
into phone nobody saw her leave
he hangs up
he stands and reaches for his jacket
i have to go
i have to go home
robert and barbara sit at the kitchen table
should we bring the police into this
no not yet
robert drives through the streets in his cadillac deville
robert rides in glum silence
he looks at passersby who are almost all black and almost all stare back at the white man in his cadillac
a group of young men stare threateningly as he rolls past
on the street in the lee of a brownstone staircase a deal is going down
sit in a coffee shop
genuinely surprised shes not at that place you sent her
she snuck away
and we havent seen her
she hasnt come home
oh man she hasnt called you
i tried to talk to her when she was up there but they wouldnt put me through
beat im surprised she hasnt called
he turns a corner and is suddenly in a drive thru drug market
dealers hustlers run at the windows from both sides signaling
what you want
hey what you want
in the coffee shop
can you tell me anything
do you have any ideas
i dont know what to say
im not the police
i dont care about experimentation
shes a kid
im worried to death
you wont say anything to my parents
i dont give a fuck about your parents we sometimes went downtown to score
the west end
we buy it off the streets
beat i can stop you know and she cant
two people really similar we can talk about anything but for me its like a weekend thing then i get my shit together and for her its different you dont
know what the hell youre talking about
youre a cocky seventeen year old and you dont have a clue what the stakes are
you dont know the value of the life youve yet to throw away
and neither does she
it is surrounded
a face presses up against the window
through the window what do you want
through the window what do you mean what do i want
rock or dope man
i dont want anything
hey man im sorry
im just trying to help
you want to help
stay the fuck away from her
im looking for my daughter
the dealer looks at him with disgust turns his back and waves everyone else away
robert slams his fist against the steering wheel
he slams it again and again
he stops and pulls away just as behind roberts car caroline crosses the street toward sketchs house
a single candle lights the room
caroline is underneath sketch the drug dealer
he is pounding away
as she clutches his back and holds on her expression is both surprised and druggy and sounds escape her mouth that she wouldnt believe she could make
theres a knock on the door
sketch continues his business
the knocking is more insistent
finally he stops and gets up and goes to the door
caroline lies back
shes in a bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but a dresser and some duffle bags
sketch opens the door what the fuck do you want
somebody outside says something
sketch walks over to a duffle bag and extracts some product
carolines eyes are glued to it as sketch hands it through the door
sketch sees her staring at the drugs
he comes back to bed
you want some of that
what you gonna do to get some of that
please what you gonna do
she turns her back to him pouting
maybe a taste
he reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray
on the tray is a rig spoon several powders and an eye dropper
he pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a speedball
he pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe and holds it up the light
it has caroline transfixed
feed this to you like a little bird
he squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air
it arcs in the candlelight
dont you want this
this is the express train
baby turnin pro and getting down in a big big hole
her concentration is entirely hypnotically focused on the syringe
sketch moves the syringe toward her lips
kiss your new mommy hello
caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe her lips part
sketch pulls the sheet back exposing her legs
he grips one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes
veins stand out on her foot
he slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly depresses the plunger
caroline watches then her head tilts back then forward she groans sexually and slumps against the pillows her eyes half open her lips twitching
sketch puts the rig back on the tray then admires carolines beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again
gordon and castro and two other agents escort ruiz out of the hotel and usher him into a waiting cruiser
they pull out in a caravan and move through the streets toward the courthouse
the cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot
gordon castro and ruiz walking with a limp cross to the building entrance
as they push inside francisco flores in a conservative grey suit passes them going outside
the parking lot is empty of people
the guards at the gate talk about something distracting
francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys
kneeling down he extracts a small powerful magnetized bomb from his jacket
he attaches it to the underside of the vehicle stands and walks toward the guard gate
the court is filled to capacity
helena and metzger watch from the gallery
the judge bangs his gavel
adler is on his feet
your honor it has come to our attention that your honor while in private practice previously represented the town of seal beach in their stop work suit against the police
department of seal beach
we believe this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated
the judge is surprised to hear this
adler this is a most unusual motion
nonetheless your honor we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law
if this is in any way designed to delay the testimony of eduardo ruiz
the judge considers
well recess until am monday morning
and ill see counsel in chambers
he slams the gavel down again
gordon castro other agents and ruiz come down the rear steps of the courthouse and walk across the street toward the parking lot
remember when we sat on that mob guy that chef for like six months
oh man ive never eaten so good in my life
to ruiz why dont you develop a useful skill
yeah like turning into a beautiful woman
they reach the car
would you mind if today we walked
its one block
i could use the fresh air
across the street francisco encrypted cell phone to his ear watches from his own car as gordon castro and ruiz stand by their car without getting in then walk away
from the car
into phone theyre not getting into the car
what are they doing
theyre walking right at me
the men start across the street toward francisco
helena drives her car through downtown san diego
into phone youve got a gun
get out of the car and shoot him in the head
francisco watches ruiz and the agents walk up the street toward him
into phone theyre going to walk right past me
what are you
get out of the car and do it
this is your chance
francisco watches the three men walk past his car
he makes a decision and opens his door
francisco steps from the car and mingles in with other people walking along the sidewalk
he follows them for few yards picking his moment
he closes the distance to gordon castro and ruiz pulling a pistol from inside his jacket
he takes careful aim from twelve feet away and is about to shoot ruiz when a bullet hole appears in his chest
he staggers trying to squeeze the trigger francisco fires the gun once wildly a tourist screams gordon and castro and ruiz turn francisco is looking down at the widening red
splotch in the center of his shirt uncertain of what has happened gordon shoves ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick shots francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street
citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an nra card coming off a bad week of day trading gordon and castro with ruiz beneath them scan the streets
ill get the car
castro runs down the street for the court parking lot
other agents are running toward gordon and ruiz
the strange man who threatened helenas children packs a high caliber rifle and scope into a briefcase
he snaps the case shut and quickly exits the room
we notice a man on the floor with a bullet hole in his head next to the open door
agents surround ruiz
gordon walks to the body of francisco lying face down in the gutter
he turns him over with his shoe and sees his face
to the other agents i saw this guy at the courthouse
beat the car gordon takes off running yelling for castro
castro has reached the car and gets in
gordon appears at the gate of the lot yelling no castro turns the ignition exactly at the moment he sees gordon yelling and waving his arms the cruiser explodes
gordon hits the pavement
parts of the car begin raining down around him
a fire truck and paramedic unit whizzes by
manolo sits at an outdoor cafe table waiting
he cant help looking around at the attractive people but hes also nervous
suddenly two men recognizable as salazars officers from the desert drug bust sitting at a nearby table rise and move to manolos table
manolo how are you
they take seats uncomfortably close to manolo
manolo have we interrupted
youre looking around like youre expecting someone
im looking for the waiter
i want to order
what are you gonna have
well if you like steak we know a much better place
well take you there
thats okay really
they each take manolo by an arm
manolo we should really be going now before it gets too crowded
were looking through the windshield as we approach the mexican border
as the car slows we pan to follow the border official as he looks in briefly and waves us through
we continue to pan to reveal manolo in the backseat sitting beside man
were in the desert
theres nothing in any directions
javi is implacable
manolo understands what is happening
i was going to feed them wrong information
feed them lies to
it was for
the men say nothing
after a beat dont tell anna i died like this
tell her it was something else
tell her it was official business
tell her that i died doing something honorable
please tell her that for me
javi and manolo stand next to two freshly dug graves
javi hesitates before turning
were on javi as we hear the gunshot
javi doesnt flinch
manolos body falls into the grave
javi stands there waiting
you got anything you want to say
javi shakes his head
finally another gunshot
after a beat a hand reaches out of javis shoulder
sorry about that
we had to be sure
they walk back to the suv
are you sure you dont have anything to tell us
javi says nothing doesnt even acknowledge them
we hear a arnie metzger is in helenas living room
the stereo is loudly playing mozart
that was a stupid thing you did
i tried arnie
and i will continue to try
have you gone crazy
you are not carl
you arent as good as carl
beat they are moving the trial to a high security location
the press has gone berserk
the jury will be influenced
stay out of things
let us try to win the case
that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us
helena steps closer to arnie close enough that her breasts are almost touching his chest
this is out of your hands
softly i know i made things worse
i know that and im sorry but arnie i need something from you
something only you can help me with
helena looks searchingly into his eyes
helena i need an introduction to the obregon brothers
i cant do that
helena leans closer to him
i figured out what carl was up to and i need your help
will you help me
an establishing shot of a hi tech company within shooting distance of the salk institute
this is a professional chemical lab that can be rented by the month
long tables of lab and computer equipment
nobody has been here in a while
there are toys plastic dolls frisbees hula hoops on many of the tables
helena lets herself into the room
she scans ledgers
she looks over the equipment
she picks up a twelve inch high plastic spastic jack action figure and a can labeled solvent and hurries from the lab
robert drives through the streets searching for caroline
he doesnt find her
barbara is waiting in the living room
he shakes his head then stands silently for a beat
about the other night im sorry
god i dont get it
are we supposed to say to ourselves be prepared to lose her be prepared to lose our child
beat why does this happen to someone
how does it happen
i dont know
robert is standing in the middle of her room
hes not sure what hes looking for
everywhere he looks her personal things beloved objects from more innocent times pictures
within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his daughter has escalated into a search for clues
he opens her drawers dumps little boxes pulls things off of shelves
he becomes increasingly unhinged flinging things around her room
he tosses a stack of magazines
a fashion magazine airborne discharges some contents a lighter a plastic tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the ground
robert stares at the foil on the carpet
its charred on the outside
he picks it up
and unfolds it
theres a dried milky white substance
he picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them
then somewhat tentatively he puts the tube in his mouth
he holds the lighter under the foil then heats the milky substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud of smoke
robert sucks all of it in
he waits a long time then exhales
his eyes shut
the tube drops from his mouth
he staggers and overwhelmed by the sensations sits on the bed
the lighter and foil fall from his hands
a moment later he opens his eyes and doesnt seem to know where he is
he looks at the room confused
he stumbles to the door and shuts it firmly behind him
anna is weeping
javier sits next to her
he puts his arm around her and she leans her head against his shoulder
javi drives through the streets of tijuana
he brakes for a stop sign and watches trance like the pedestrians crossing in front of him
as the intersection clears he remains still
a honk from behind brings him back and he pulls forward passing helena ayala who crosses going the opposite direction
we stay with her
helena walks down a nightlife street that is tawdry and stale in the midday sun
a shrewd obregon lieutenant juan marquez sits at a table opposite helena
the strange man who both threatened helenas child and executed francisco sits in another chair
thank you for coming
i am juan marquez i work for mr
i believe you know my associate tigrillo the little tiger
helena nods to tigrillo yes he threatened to kill my five year old son
beat i was under the impression i would be meeting juan obregon
no this is not possible
and i thank you for coming down here though i suspect its been a pointless journey
why do you say that mr
i hear these stories
your husband in jail
his business in chaos
various people fighting over the scraps
my husband is the victim of an informer in your organization not ours
that is not true mrs
your route is compromised
perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california
i dont think youre going to do that
listen to this woman in a mans world a very violent world
there are plenty of other suppliers in mexico
but not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt
helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the spastic jack action figure
she puts it on the desk
my husband had been working on something he called the project for the children
are you aware of this
i dont know
perhaps i remember something
we have the ability to change the color odor and physical property of cocaine
you want to smuggle narcotics in mr
thats nothing new
juan marquez is confused
this doll is cocaine
juan picks up spastic jack and looks at him
he bangs it on the desk
every part from his ears to his accessory belt is high impact pressure molded cocaine
undetectable by dogs
undetectable by anyone
i dont believe you
she takes out the solvent and puts it on his desk
get a bowl
spastic jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent
only his shoulders head and ridiculous ears remain above the quicksand of milky glop
helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp
she is drying the paste
she puts the mirror on the desk
a white substance has coagulated there
juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance into two white powder lines
he hands a silver straw to helena
im six months pregnant
i wont do it
fine then we dont have deal
fine then we dont have a deal
he watches her a beat then smiles
he leans down and quickly snorts a line
after a beat
thats good coke
it should be
beat i want our debt forgiven
i want to be the exclusive distributor of obregon brothers cocaine for the united states
and i want the principle witness against my husband eduardo ruiz killed
im afraid i must first ask you to pass a test
i asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors
juan marquez reaches in his desk and pulls out a quarter kilo of cocaine
he pushes it across the desk
take this back with you
deliver it safely to tigrillo in san diego and we have a deal
my husband is on trial for smuggling
exactly and this is how i know im not getting into business with the u
she puts the quarter key in her bag and stands
you will help me with my other problem
deliver that safely to tigrillo in san diego
and we have a deal
tigrillo escorts her out of the room
helena follows tigrillo
as they pass the restrooms she signals that she has to stop
helena goes into a stall
she extracts the cocaine from her handbag
she looks at it trying to figure out where it goes
she hikes up her skirt
javier is hooked up to a polygraph machine watched closely by a polygraph operator
hughes and johnson watch as javi talks into a tape recorder on the table
and i have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones
they change them every twenty four hours but i have a contact at mextel who can get me the new esns within twelve
javi finishes talking and sits back
agent hughes shuts off the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who nods approval
hughes and johnson exchange a look
they are dumbstruck
thats good shit
now that you have what you want lets talk about how i get what i want
oh dont worry javier youre not gonna have any problems there
i want to take a minute and talk about what type of precautions youre taking to protect yourself
when salazar and madrigal go down they might send someone to see you
you worry about getting me the things that i want
ill worry about myself
theres a beat
javier seems discomfited
the two agents notice this and exchange looks
you should feel good about this
i feel like a traitor
javi goes into mexico
pan over to helenas mercedes
she inches the car forward towards the officer who selects vehicles for inspection
the car ahead of her passes through and speeds away
the officer flags helena and directs her into the search facility
helena pulls into a search bay
a customs officer watches helena lower her window
please step from the car maam
im in a hurry step from the car maam
this wont take long from your day
helena gets out of her car
there is a bank of video monitors showing the scenes all over the facility
on the monitor helenas car is on a lift three feet off the ground
officers pour over the inside and undercarriage of the mercedes
nearby a german shepherd sniffs at the items that have been removed from the car bags spare tire cd boxes
customs officers approach helena maam we have to ask you to come with us
she follows them toward the customs building
a female customs inspector accompanied by a female supervisory inspector leads helena into a sterile room where there is no place to hide anything
maam we have reason to believe you may have illegal drugs hidden beneath your clothing
i need to conduct a pat down search
supervisory inspector haig will witness the search
youve got to be kidding me
what if i refuse
this pamphlet explains the law and your rights under it
youre welcome to read it first
it says we have the authority to conduct this search
would you like to read it first or shall we proceed
hundreds of dea agents spouses others stand around a grave in a leafy cemetery in working class san diego
the funeral is over and people are filing back to the cars
gordon walks away from the service when he is approached by a mourning lucinda castro the mother of the deceased
gordon hugs her
you know how much he cared about you
you do dont you
i know if he could have it back somehow he wouldnt do it differently or have it any other way
he loved his job
another agent hustles toward him from the other direction the direction of the cars
excuse me agent gordon
to gordon helena ayala left club platinum in tijuana
the obregon brothers place
they stopped her at the border but she was clean
shes in san diego now
gordon runs for his car
arnie sits in his office spacing out admiring his view when an assistant shows helena in
as soon as the door shuts did you get it
what are you thinking calling me at home with a message like that
youve compromised me and our relationship helena sits confidently on his couch
making fun of arnie the place is swept twice a day
i learned that down in miami in
im the housewife
i belong to the most exclusive country club in la jolla that accepts latinos
until recently i believed my husband imported hydroponic strawberries which i donated at the school fair
arnie reaches into a desk drawer and pulls out a quarter kilo baggy identical to the one juan obregon gave her in tijuana
its the same stuff
from the rainy day stash
its the same
what happened to what they gave you
helena puts the bag in her purse
im desperate but im not stupid
i flushed it in the bathroom of their godawful nightclub
robert sleeps in his clothes on top of the covers
barbara is asleep beside him
the phone rings
did i wake you
robert looks at barbara and shakes his head
she gets up
no its all right
theres a beat
salazars been taken down
he was working for porfirio madrigal
i thought madrigal was dead
i thought it was verified
look its a shit storm here right now
when are you coming back
beat i dont know what to tell people any more
ill get there as soon as i can
if were moving the press conference we need to do it now
beat are you all right
the tone in barbaras voice causes him to look up
she holds an empty jewelry box
to sheridan i have to call you back
the drawers and cabinets are open
barbara and robert assess what is missing
the silver wedding cup
robert looks at their home entertainment center
barbara enters this room
my leicas gone
sos the video camera
at least shes alive
robert turns for the door
where are you going
shell be at a pawn shop in an hour
ten minutes after that shell be at her dealers
if i find him maybe i find her
the bored children of privilege wearing their blazers or uniform grey skirts stare at a teacher behind a desk
the door opens and robert enters
he finds seth abrahms in the back of the class and walks straight to him
robert grabs a fistful of shirt and tie
hey man what are you doing
robert yanks seth out of his seat
the teacher is approaching
seth has to be excused
hes going on a field trip
helena watches david play a video game
they have finished their lunch a mess of pizza rinds
time to go
the clown tries to catch their attention with some mime but they ignore him
helena and david are pushing out the door
the man walking the other way past them is tigrillo from the tijuana cartel
as they pass under her breath womens room stall two
loud should we stop for ice cream
tigrillo disappears into the restaurant
as helena pulls out of the fun zone parking lot an unmarked dea cruiser falls in behind her
robert and seth are parked across the street from sketchs building
they watch people mostly white people get what they need
i dont know maybe we missed her
i cant believe you used to bring my daughter here to this place
hey man back the fuck up
to this place
whats that shit
right now all over this country a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see you got any drugs
you know where i can get drugs
what kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person on their possibilities
if you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood indian hills and they asked every white person they saw hey you got any drugs
within a day your friends and their kids would be selling
its market forces man
the products marked up three hundred percent
you can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day
you think white people would still be going to law school
theres a beat
youre starting to piss me off
get out of the car
robert and seth get our of the car and walk across the street
robert and seth stand in the dim dingy hallway
a junkie leaves
youre gonna get me killed
robert shoves seth toward the door
the door opens a crack and sketchs face appears
what do you want
robert moves around seth
im looking for my daughter caroline
she comes here
this is a business
get the fuck outta here
i need to find my daughter
ill pay you
sketch pulls a gun and shoves it against roberts cheek
who the fuck do you think you are
where the fuck do you think you are
why the fuck do you think i shouldnt just put you in a dumpster
i have money i got money
ill pay you a thousand dollars
i have it in my wallet
i want your money ill take your money
just tell me where she is
sketch pushes robert back into the hall
sketch sees seth lurking there
to seth dont do that shit again
sketch slams the door in their face
what a good idea
seth and robert walk to the car
man im telling you
dont do this vigilante thing
either the cops find her or shell call you
robert looks at him carefully
javier knocks on the front door
there is no answer
the shades are drawn
the house is darkened
calling out anna
let me in
he knocks again
you cant stay locked in your house all day
finally the door cracks open
anna has clearly not been out of the house since the last time we saw her
javier sits opposite anna
i know this is a tragedy but you have to realize that good has come out of it
she looks at him
if manolo hadnt gone and told them what he did then salazar and madrigal would never have been brought to justice
he did a great thing for tijuana
he did a great thing for mexico
i want to believe you
i really do
you will believe me because its true
seth walks up the steps and into the building
a beat later he reappears and continues down the street
robert emerges from across the street and follows at a guarded distance
seth walks along the seedy neighborhood street
he approaches the villa elaine
he turns up the steps and disappears inside
robert follows him
robert ascends the stairs
as he enters the hallway he sees seth pounding on one of the doors
open the door
open the fucking door man
a mans voice comes from the other side of the door
robert closes the distance
seth pounds harder
i know shes in there
let me talk to her
i dont know what youre talking about
robert reaches the door
seth sees him
i know shes in there
robert kicks the door in
robert sees a middle aged john in his underwear and a dress shirt
hey i havent touched her caroline is passed out on the bed
robert goes to her as the john scrambles for his clothes
she stirs and sees him really out of it hi daddy
caroline rides in the passenger seat
shes come out of her stupor and is now filled with ebullience
its gonna be great
i mean im okay and all because see i met a guy hes in this pretty famous band and
gets up confessional courage theyve invited me to write lyrics for them im gonna be able to do that and maybe sing too
not at first but later
caroline gets lost in her grandiose vision
robert looks over at her as she drifts off into a nod
a moment later shes awake and rambling again
sounding completely crazy ive been doing research for the school paper thats what ive been doing like on assignment kind of ive seen some stuff you wouldnt believe but im
gonna write it all down into lyrics
they think im really good everybody says so what do you think
robert fights back tears
he reaches over and takes his daughters hand
juan marquez sits across the desk from javi
tigrillo and pablo s are also in the meeting
salazar and madrigal are no longer with us
beat a feat none of these people could get accomplished
juan nods toward pablo and tigrillo
youre going to be made the special assistant to the new drug czar which makes you a very valuable law enforcement officer
beat i hope you like to travel because we have plans for juarez and el paso nogales sinaloa jalisco michoacan
javi just stares at him for a long moment then looks off
robert on the telephone
into phone how was she
a cramped messy office at the environmental protection agency
barbara is on the phone
into phone im really not sure
she seemed to recognize it wasnt serenity oaks
its a pretty hard core facility but at least we know where she is
beat maybe its what she needs now
he holds the phone and doesnt say anything
the court is searched carefully by a phalanx of officers
metal detectors are checked
bomb sniffing german shepherds are led through the space
the agents are unkempt and everyone is tired
ruiz moves through a cluttered room in a bathrobe with a cup of coffee
an agent shows him a morning paper big day
shows picture in paper youre a star
ruiz walks over and sits across from gordon switching off the radio show hes listening to
gordon looks up from his paper
there is a knock on the front door
an agent goes to answer who is it
through the door the mafia
ive got his breakfast
the agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray
he puts the food in front of ruiz who uncovers the sausage and eggs
an agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage
ruiz stabs it with a fork fuck off
gordon watches the interchange wheres the love gone eddie
youll be testifying for at least ten days
what if we stop feeding you
ruiz begins to eat hungrily
you expect me to be grateful for spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder
that thought makes me feel awful
ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast
cant you for a second imagine none of this had happened
that my drugs had gone through
what would have been the harm
a few people get high who are getting high anyway
your partner is still alive
we avoid having breakfast together
dont you see this means nothing
that your whole life is pointless
youre breaking my heart
the worst thing about you monty is you realize the futility of what youre doing and you do it anyway
i wish you could see how transparent you are
disgusted this food tastes like shit
so go shower already
you only got to me because you were tipped off by the juarez cartel whos trying to break into tijuana
youre helping them
beat you work for a drug dealer too monty
ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom
yelling after him and shave
you better look nice and believable for the jury
ruiz disappears into the bathroom and slams the door behind him
to another agent its like having another wife
the agent laughs
theres another knock on the door
who is it
though the door breakfast
gordon and the agent look at each other
its getting cold
gordon moves to the side of the door and pulls his gun
the other agent opens the door
a man with a breakfast tray enters
gordon puts the gun to the side of his head
im on your side
god youre jumpy
gordon is momentarily confused then goes for the bathroom door
call an ambulance
gordon tries the bathroom door
he gets it open a crack
theres a body against the other side
ruiz is on the floor in convulsions
yelling call the ambulance
to ruiz dont die on me
you will not die on me
do you hear me
dont you die on me
ruizs convulsions get worse his claw like fingers scratch across the tile
the court is packed
helena and arnie watch from the gallery
the judge is at the bench
the prosecutor rises your honor ladies and gentlemen of the jury
because of the sudden death of eduardo ruiz the people have decided that at this point we cannot continue our case against carl ayala
the court erupts
robert wakefield enters the office of the chief of staff who looks up from what hes doing which is reading roberts report and is already mid sentence
yeah hi waves robert to a chair so ive got a copy of your speech here
glances down still reading its fantastic
so robert my genuine thanks
youre my choice and youre gonna be great
the president is sorry he hasnt been able to spend more time with you
after the press conference he wants to really sit down
an afterthought oh i got to the post too
dont worry about that thing with your daughter its not news theyre willing to treat it as a family matter a personal matter
off roberts stare look even if it came out wed turn it into a qualification ive been in the trenches of this drug war i have seen the face of
the enemy etcetera
robert just stares at him
general salazar sits in the same grimy cell that housed francisco flores
he is sweating and his breathing is labored
a doctor enters and gives him an injection explaining that it will calm him down
its a reprise of the earlier desert bust
a landing strip in the middle of nowhere a plane landing suvs approaching
this time javi is at the wheel of one of them
news crews are trailing behind him
javi and special agent hughes stand next to a giant mound of seized cocaine the same cocaine in fact javi held briefly at the beginning
the same teenagers from the pickup truck have been arrested
the news crews get everything
to the press this seizure is one of the largest seizures in mexican history
it represents the first bilateral effort of the american dea and the mexican general salazar lies on his side eyes and mouth open
he is dead
javier looks at him through the doorway
today im very proud to announce that mexico with the help of our american partners is finally winning the war against narcotics trafficking
the press begins shouting questions robert and javi walk through the headquarters a nondescript government building
robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila envelope
the crates of cocaine are clearly marked
the cocaine brand is an east coast brand a juarez cartel brand and you must know it usually comes through into el paso
im aware of that
so whats it doing in tijuana
javi looks robert wakefield squarely in the eye
let me ask you a hypothetical question if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel and he went out of power would it mean the juarez cartel is losing
it could mean that yes
that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power
is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who isnt connected in some war to one of the cartels
javi thinks along time before answering
yeah its possible
if youre prepared to die
an outdoor party is going on
children and adults arrive and mingle
caterers work the barbecue grill
waiters serve food and drink on the rolling lawn
helena circles through the crowd greeting friends
she looks past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair van is parked
she turns back toward her guests
somebody has raised a cup and everyone is cheering
helena drinks with her guests then walks inside her house
montel gordon walks through the gate and up the drive
he grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter
he appears drunk
montel follows helena into the house
carl hears the cheering outside and the sound of laughter
he makes a cellular telephone call
arnie is in his office and answers the cell phone its saturday arnie
you work too hard
carl im running late
im coming right now behind arnie in the office there is a movement of shadow
carl stands at the window looking at his guests while he talks on the phone dont bother
so arnie when were you going to tell me about the million dollars we got in from san francisco two days after i got arrested
i was just waiting for the right time
and you didnt feel like you could trust my wife with this news
i just didnt want to take a chance
i didnt want to risk it
it could have been frozen along with everything else
you had it all figured out
you move into my house
you raise my kids
you sleep with my wife
it was a good plan arnie
carl thats insane
so my wife is lying
carl think about it if i was trying to rip you off i would have left town after ruiz was killed
i wouldnt sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal
on the front lawn children are lined up for the ice cream sundae bar that is being tended by a waiter
arnie do think theres a difference between a reason and an excuse because i dont think there is
carl goodbye arnie
arnie turns around and there are two men in his office
carl hears muffled gunshots over the phone
he hangs up and turns from the window
helena is standing there
who was that
hes not going to be able to make the barbecue
carl and helena share an embrace and a kiss
everyone is waiting
carl and helena turn to leave the room and montel gordon is standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne
what a great party
who are you
im a nobody who arrested you but your wife is a murderer
gordon takes a sip of his drink
two security officers appear in the doorway behind him
hey you cant be in here
im a cop
i dont care
to the guards throw him out of here
the security officers grab gordon
there is a scuffle
gordon falls to the floor by the window
they are wrestling
as they wrestle gordon reaches out and unnoticed affixes tiny listening device underneath the desk
he continues to struggle with the guards
helena and carlos start from the room
calling out you didnt win helena
you lost everything
tell your children a nice bedtime story
how you killed my partner
the guests watch as the guards eject gordon from the premises
near the gate david has stopped playing to watch the action
then he goes back to playing with his toy a spastic jack figure
javi and his convoy of armored suvs pull up in front of the beautiful house where earlier he deposited rosario salazars former mistress
javier opens the front door and rosario greets him by throwing her arms around his neck
they disappear inside
the press secretary stands at the familiar podium addressing the white house press corps
robert wakefield stands to one side with chief of staff his lawyers sheridan and general landry
a sterling reputation and close friend of the president recently confirmed into the office of national drug control policy
our new drug czar robert hudson wakefield
applause from the assembled press
the press secretary signals and robert walks to the podium
he looks back to the chief of staff he stares out at the expectant faces and television lights and camera flashes
reading his prepared speech the war on drugs is a war on our nations most precious resource
sixty eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority number one
beat there has been progress and there have been failures but where we have fallen short i see not a problem but an opportunity
robert is becoming increasingly uneasy
he glances at the chief of staff who bores into him
he looks again at his speech
with great effort he continues
an opportunity to correct the mistakes of the past while laying a solid foundation for the future
a long uncomfortable beat this takes not only new ideas but perseverance
this takes not only resources but courage
this takes not only government but families
robert stops again as though the words are choking him
ive outlined a ten point plan representing a new bilateral effort
he cant finish
everyone stares at robert
the crowd of reporters senses something is wrong
i cant do this
beat if there is a war on drugs then our own families have become the enemy
how can you wage war on your own family
he walks out of the room
the crowd waits expecting him to return
robert walks down a corridor and out of the white house
a beautiful spring morning
he walks down to pennsylvania avenue
he hails a cab and gets in
the cab pulls away
a twelve step meeting is in progress
caroline shares from her seat
on the good days i feel like i get it like it all makes sense
i can stay in the moment
i dont have to control everything in the future
and i believe everything is going to work out fine
beat on the bad days i just want to grab the phone and start dialing numbers
i want to pull my hair and run through the streets screaming
beat but thanks to the people ive met in these rooms people like margaret and jim and sarah people whove taught me how to listen im pretty sure ill make
it through today
caroline is finished sharing
would you like to share
we pan over to reveal robert and barbara sitting next to caroline
my name is robert
this is my wife barbara
were carolines parents
were just hear to listen
the house is dark and silent
the van is parked up the street
gordon listens through a headset his expression set
over a listening device were back up and running
a bank of lights cranks on
then another and another
in a wider shot we see an illuminated baseball field where a childrens pickup game is in progress
in the crowd javi serenely watches the game
