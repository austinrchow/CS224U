shelly berger late s flannel shirt earth shoes psychotherapist sits with donnie and maggie
he comes home at all hours of the night without announcing when or why or where hes been for three weeks
or three months
then he expects everything to be just the way he wants it
be vacuums the entire house

and you joe what do you think youre running from
i aint runnin from nothin
mimics i aint runnin from nuttin
the man i married was a college man
to berger sorry
resuming to donnie being the distancer forces maggie into the role of the pursuer
that gives you a feeling of power
simultaneously you resent maggie for expressing the very intimacy needs that in your own li fe yo u v e i m an undercover agent for the i didnt marry
the fbi joe
he writes on a pad
donnie tries to peek at what hes writing
i want yo u to spli t the week in half
monday wednesday and friday are joes intimacy days

on your day you make one intimacy request
your partner agrees in advance to meet it

maggie starts to punch him
youre an animal animal donnie tries to fend her off while he drives
the car swings wildly
approaching the opposite way donnie swerves
the car tumbles off the road onto a soft shoulder
maggie continues to hit at donnie
he wrestles with her
i hope punch those guys youre hanging out with punch are laying you punch because i m punch not anymore
he looks at her
she looks at him
and they grappling in the front seat
he grabs her
pulls her toward him
realizes that she is encumbered by something
she deftly unhooks the bel t
ki sses his neck
under her breath do it
but hes not buying
maggie who told you to wear a seat belt
its a simple question
you never wore a seat belt before maggie

donnie lies awake
when did you all of a sudden from nowhere start saying do it maggie
go to sleep
you never said that do it
you never talked that way before
kerry wakes up to an odd groaning and whining noise
donnie compulsively vacuums the living room
bursey installs a special black phone

donnie turns back
bursey shrugs continues to install the phone
kerry and sherry indict him with their eyes
exit the bedroom
donnie drives through a driving rain
looks in the rear view mirror
a car turns with him
he turns again
again the car follows
donnie looks again in the rear view mirror
something familiar about that car
a scowl of recognition plays across donnies face
and he goes cold
approaching an intersection donnie slows then speeds through the intersection as the yellow light goes red
checks his mirror the other car is stuck at the light
she smacks the steering wheel in anger
fuck fuck fuck you

donnie nods toward the parking lot
lefty looks sees a lincoln town car pull up
lefty jogs up the dock as steve disalvo s trafficantes enforcer emerges from the lincoln

he and lefty shake hands

trafficante peers down the dock through thick prescription which ones sonny black
hogue looks at large color surveillance photos of the left hand as it tools around tampa harbor
as the party progresses sonny black and trafficante split off and move to the bow
then donnie joins sonny and trafficante
sonny introduces them
taped dialogue from the group in the stern with seagulls surf and the sounds of a party
as his face turns grim
as donnie shakes hands with trafficante
an fbi man shaking hands with the boss o f florida
did it e ver occur to anyone that that is simply not possible
score one for our side
what makes you so sure hes on our side
sonny and donnie stand in the bow look out over the water

lefty broods nurses a spritzer
watches donnie with eyes full of anger and resentment
boobie sidles up to him
can i ask you something
did you get this boat or did donnie get this boat
some broad down here he used to know it belongs to her brother
he knows a lot of broads donnie
if donnie had a dollar for every broad of all his broads he could buy the fucking boat himself
if donnies got so many broads how come we never seen none of them
he uses them broads like kleenex
he wont spend a dollar to take a lady out
boobie drinks takes a beat
you ever notic e donnie buy guns from you if youre offing guns but you never see him be the one offing guns
lefty thinks a beat
donnie takes off his cowboy boots
takes the nagra out of his boot rewinds the tape
i just got some things i gotta take care of back in the city
when you come back you represent me in florida
he snaps it off
hides it back in his cowboy boot
donnie and lefty wait with the crowd at the baggage carousel
im telling you its good to be back in new york
that fucking florida baked everybodys brain
when sonny gets out of the fucking sun hes gonna realize what a miserable fucking idea you had
how longs he gonna stay down there

donnie and lefty stand alone by the carousel arms folded as their suitcases go around
terry and kerry and their new boyfriends make out on their parents bed
limbs writhing in adolescent lust
then a ring
by the bedside
they stop watch it ring
then terrys hand moves toward the forbidden phone
terry lefty slams the phone down
sits with a huff in his chair
louise brings him a spritzer
here you go bennie

lefty frustrated turns on the tv
a japanese maitre d greets sonny donnie nicky and boobie at the door

the maitre d ushers them inside
donnie lingers behind nervous
my wife says its very in japanese

the maitre d waits for donnies shoes gestures
donnie thinking fast

the moment of truth

donnie in with the m excited by the fray the adrenaline rush
he kicks the maitre d hard
the mait re d screams
hogue listens to the tape
donnies hard breathing
the maitre d s screams
the thuds of donnies kicks
nicky takes a roll of quarters
holds it in his fist punches hard across the maitre ds brow
blood torrents from the gash
blinded by the blood the maitre d swings wildly
on the blood and falls into the puddle
sees the stains on his slacks
in a rage now
boobie grabs a garbage can swings it at the maitre d who sinks in a heap unconscious
the guys continue to kick at him
as he backs away appalled by the explosion of violence and his part in it
photos of the maitre d bloodied and bruised taken at the hospital afterwards
hogue i nspects th em
the tape plays

this is what the fbi does
youre telling me this is the fucking fbi
you think joe went over to the other side
i think thats a question worth asking dont you
ask him the fuck yourself
from everything we know what he did is simply not possible
then you look at the guns and the porno tapes and with photos this
that is not the behavior of an fbi agent
i listen to those tapes and that is not the speech of an fbi agent
i m tired of defending what we did
youre so sure he went over the other side
maybe we should fucking arrest him
we should pull him out is what we should do
we dont even know where the fuck he is clarence
joes a seducer
he seduced them
well maybe he fucking seduced you
on the wall reads
the phone rings
jules grabs it

nicky and lefty climb into leftys cadillac
sonny boobie and donnxe approache boobies cadillac
donnie reaches for the back door
to donnie why dont you sit in front
a sudden chord of terror plays up donnies spine
donnie looks to lefty for help
for some indication
but his eyes are dead
they all climb in boobies cadillac
ulls away from the curb drives off
boobie pulls out of the lot in g is cadillac drives off in the opposite direction
hogue broods as the fbi men roll down their sleeves pull on their jackets snap closed their briefcases

hes very reliable
goddamit hogue frantically dials the phone
sonny blacks not the target
sonny blacks the shooter
i just assumed oh my god
boobie drives donnie beside him
the menacing quiet of the open road
past prospect park
hey boob remember how we used to run around here when we was kids
we used to have running races
i whipped your ass many a time
when i raced witcha it looked like youre standing still
i whipped your ass

boobie and sonny crouch at an imaginary starting line
were running to the fountain
you remember the fountain
i remember the fountain
donnie you do the on your marks
on yo ur ma rk s
ge t s et
they jump off the line
running through the blackness
sonny takes an early lead but boobies leaner
starts to pull away
looks over at sonny grins
into the darkness
sees them disappear into the trees
huffing and puffing
they disappear into the darkness
and donnie realizes that hes turning around and around
a rat with no place to hide
boobie looks over at sonny pulls away
adrenaline rushes through him
as he turns and turns and waits
for the bullet that will kill him
s onny yard s behind h im
then sonny stop s
reaches into his w aistb and
and pulls out boobie running free in the night
reaches the fountain holds up his a rms in vic tory
lea ns over h ands on k nees whee zing
turn s smiling
and his smile fractures
jogs a couple of steps to find some cover
then hears as it echoes through the park
donnie crouches by reflex
from the shadows a man staggers toward donnie its boobie bleeding profusely from a head wound
sonny chases him
the champagne pop
of more gunshots
fucking son of a bitch
donnie get iml boobie staggers bleeding from three wounds now
running toward his car
donnie runs toward him
the crunch of wet grass
boobie falls heavily
blood belches out of his mouth
sonny catches up
by the barrel and savagely smashes boobie in the head
a thick sound like a melon falling off a shelf
again and again
donnie backs off looks up as in his cadillac
nicky beside him
sonny tosses boobies keys to donnie
pull his car around i think he has a bag in the trunk
lefty pours donnie a scotch
sits down with a spritzer
he was holding out on him
fucking coke deal boobie was running down in florida
sonny found out about it
do i still gotta school you after w hatever fu cking yea rs
thats the worst thing you could do to a m an li ke so nny black
you could pull his cock before you could take a dollar out of his pocket
howd he find out

i dont know left
boobie was a friend of all of us
boobie wasnt no friend to you donnie believe me

as he realizes that lefty sold out boobie to save him

lefty finishes his spritzer
gets up to make another
i dont know what made you think id give you up
i had too many fucking disappointments in my l ife
neve r in the f ucking en d of the earth will i give you up
donnie holds the nagra in his hand
the sounds of the murder as it plays
on tape help me
then the crunch as donnie tackles him
donnie rips the tape out of the nagra throws it in the sink
donnie watches the today show on the tv over the bar
the guys plan gin
i n other news an fbi sting has resulted in the arrests of over state and federal officials
surveillance images of fbi sheiks dressed in flowing caftans
then the image cuts to video of the same sheiks partying with congressmen on a docked yacht
known as abscam it was the largest such operation in the bureaus history
donnie peers more closely at the tv
with the name the left hand emblazoned on it
donnie pull up a chair
donnie takes a last look at the tv
joins sonny nicky and lefty at the card table as nicky shuffles the cards
to donnie you know how to keep score
a moment of recognition that donnie mows the grass
row after precise row
rakes the clippings into identical evenly spaced piles
fills up trash bags piles them neatly on the curb
a sta tion wagon parked n ext to mag gies corv ette
don nie notice s that the station wagon is filthy
runs a finger through the dirt on the hood
the pile of trash in the well of the car mcdonalds wrappers tampax wrappers a copy of mademoiselle a lipstick a basketball
pulls out the ashtray
something that makes him suspicious
between his fingers
he digs into the space between the se ats
fin ds a quart er
a pape r clip
a nd then terry stumbles down the stairs in her bathrobe half asleep
she hears donnie crash inside and something tells her its about her
about face into the bathroom
donnie hears the bathroom door upstairs click locked
turns as maggie enters from the kitchen
she still asleep
i think so

a sle ep at noon
it all fits the profile
joe youre scaring me
the twelve warning signs

terry listens by the door
as donnie counts off the warning signs of drug addiction

hostility to authority

don nie mov es to comfort her to apologize
maggie then storms out of the house
donnie broods looks up to the landing as sherry and kerry come out from their rooms
from outside sounds of maggie as she slams into her corvette and zooms out of the driveway engine roaring and tires squealing
donnie bangs through swinging doors past orderlies in white coats his face tight with anxiety his skin green in the cold fluorescent light

a thick tube runs from a lung machine into her mouth
donnie takes her hand

i waited my whole life bruno you can wait two hours
they climb out of the car
philly lucky stays put
what the hells wrong with you
i aint going in your fucking basement
you got spiders all over that basement
hes scared of spiders
what a piece of work
leave me the keys
i wanna play the radio
big trin flips him the keys
alongside the house leading down into the basement
with a groan big trin b ends pul ls them op en
flips a light s witch
s h it
bu lb m us t be o ut
w at ch your step
sonny red and anthony bruno follow him down
philly lucky starts the oar
turns on the radio
frank sinatra sings nice work if you can get it
and pulls away
go big trin sonny red and anthony bruno down into the dark damp concrete and sawdust in their nostrils
wheres that fucking flashlight
and the flash of a shotgun firing
as shotguns explode
by the light of the flashes we see sonny lefty and nicky bangl and another flash
then a pause
nicky reaches up screws in the light bulb
revealing the blasted corpses of sonny red and big trin
jumps out from behind a cabinet runs out the door
sonny wheels fires
the stairs splinter as the blast lands just under brunos escaping feet
lefty moves to chase him
well give the contract to donnie
nicky takes out a hefty bag and a long bladed butcher knife
sets to carving up the bodies
carrying his mail donnie enters a dark room
moonlight filters through the blinds
he closes the door
flips the light switch
instantly he falls into a fighting crouch knife at the ready
his hand trembles with adrenaline
he moves with his back to the wall straining to see into the black room
he p ivo ts in a c omba t s tan ce nob ody
th en piv ots aga in
hi s f ree hand f umbles in the kitch en drawer
finds a flashlight
the bea m sweeps across the room
donnie moves on cat feet to the bathroom
the shower curtains drawn shut
donnie tears them back thrusts the knife
d onnie thin ks a beat
snaps th e flashli ght back o n
riffles through h is m ail
rip s op en reads by the light of the flashlight donnie a dimly seen dervish of rage
he hurls the flashlight
throws a chair and it splinters
grabs the bar from his weight bench and starts to swing
and an electric sizzle as the television implodes
donnie drops the bar and throws a bookcase to the ground
punches at the wall
again and again and again
then sags to the ground
the electric bill
i cant get over it
the fucking b didnt pay the fucking electric billi maggie convalesces her wounds have begun to heal and shes no longer intubated although her eyes are still bandaged
jules enters sits down beside her
takes her hand
its jules maggie
i could hear your cheap shoes all the way down the hall
howre you feeling
s ca re d
did you see joe
you mean did joe see me
the b wants him to come out
hell never come out
y ou dont believe the shit that c omes up
i have to argue with t hem that he hasnt gone over to t he other side
he wouldnt have the imagination
i wish hed become a gangster at least we could pay our frigging bills
maybe you could talk to him
do you know what this is about j ules
thi s is about a promotion
i talked to him about that
not from you from them
he wants to be a made guy
as he hears this
he knows that this has gone too far
for years i tried to figure out what m ade joe t ick
and t hen i finally figured it out theres nothing ti cking
he s got his rules and hes gonna live by his rules
the job is the job

when hes in the fbi he wants to be the best and when hes in the mafia h e wants t o be the b est like its all some
frigging basketball game
maybe this is none of my business but dont worry i m not gonna leave him
i didnt h ave him w hen i had him
now that its almo st over i m goddamned if ill let someone else have him
christmas decorations and a tree
lefty watches a nature program on tv
a leopard moves stealthily
cloaked by the high grasses of the african savanna the stalking leopard moves stealthily
louise enters with donnie
bennie donnie here
ill continued separated from the herd the gazelle senses danger
lefty rapt in his easy chair
bennie loves animals
the leopard charges
teeth tear at the gazelle
and soon the leopard and her family feed on a bloody carcass
hunter and hunted predator and prey the endless cycle of nature repeated once again
mino you see that
ill be inside if you need me
were going out louise
louise exits inside
satisfied lefty snaps off the show with his remote control
turns to donnie
t hey found bruno
he s shacki ng up with a broad down city island
on a boat

being a made guys the greatest thing in the world
lefty reaches into the drawer
hands another gun to donnie
as he looks at the gun in his hand
donnie and lefty sit and wait in donnies cadillac
maybe he aint gonna show
i m just saying maybe we should forget about it pop him tomorrow night

lefty reaches in his pocket
a piece of paper folded torn from newsweek
the headline beneath the headline a photo of the sheiks partying ona yacht the left hand
donnie looks up from the article
sees in leftys hand
thats a fucking federal boat donnie

as bruno emerges from the boat
lights a cigarette
looks around shit

those fucking agents could scam senators and congressmen and meanwhile we had a party on their boat and they didnt get a fucking thing on us

than the fuckin g congressmen

donnie checks the action on his gun
how the fuck did i know it was a fucking federal boat
i die witcha
i m your best friend donnie
donnie opens the door climbs out gun in hand
thats right left youre my best friend
your best friend is the one who kills you
lefty looks at him
pointed at donnies back
as his finger moves toward the trigger
then su dde nly from police cherrytops
swarms of fbi men in blue windbreakers with big wh ite lette rs fbi descend o n the car guns draw n
they g rab donnie and lefty
jules hustles donnie away
calling donnie dont say nothing
dont say nothing to them
its over joe

what the fuck
im not coming out
its over joe
its not over
im too close
donnie starts to run
fbi men are on top of him wrestling him dovr
donnie struggles exchanges a look with lefty as hes dragged away
donnie dont say nothing
at the fbi academy at quantico then with berada lebow and other fbi men as marshall and jules show them to sonny nicky and boobie
you know this guy as donnie bras co
he s an fbi age nt
we just wanted to tell you
sonny nicky lefty legs and philly lucky watch as the fbi men drive off
they stand on the street corner death and disbelief written in their faces
you believe that fucking guy
theres no fucking way donnae could be an agent
the culliones on him bluffing us like that
you think they got him
a tech team aims a parabolic microphone and a telephoto lens
the whir of an autowindex and a freeze frame as they stand outside
no way he could be an agent
nowadays they can doctor a picture any fucking way they want
it still dont explain that boat
l ef t y li s te n s
s a ys no th i ng
h e k no w s th e t r ut h
zz z h a n d another freeze frame
that boat was a set up
then we think donnies a rat and we get scared and fuggedaboudit
maybe they brainwashed him
like in that movie with sinatra
z z zh
a no t he r s ho t
z zz hl they say hes an agent i say hes a fucking agent
youre talking through your ass
you didnt know him
you didnt know donnie philly
as he listens
lefty sits broods watches tv
the phone rings
listens yeah okay n ic ky
o k ay
he han gs up
th inks a bea t
as he l ooks into his open grave
t akes off his gold watch sticks it in a drawer
then the cross he wears a roun d his neck
the keys to his c adill ac
c loses the draw er as louise enters
who was that
im going out
he gives louise a kiss
dont wait up for me
d c e l h m i f i t w a b e a m d l t i s de sits at his desk preparing his testimony
marshall drops some surveillance photos off
they just took these yesterday
donnie picks them up
photos of leftys rooftop
as the pigeon coops are dismantled
in his office
donnie ducks in
jules looks up sees donnie struggle a beat with his emotion
then the mask descends again
you can stop looking for lefty
under heavy guard donnie walks up a b ack stairca se
up a marble hallway
doors open and he enters the courtroom
a hush falls as the mafia defendants lined up in the docks all f ac es weve seen earlier including sonny nicky legs and philly l ucky turn and look
the government calls special agent joseph d
as he takes in the proof of his accomplishment
with the knowledge of what it has cost him
a final crawl runs over this the evidence collected by donnie brasco led to over indictments
special agent joseph d
pistone left the fbi
he lives with his wife under an assumed name in an undisclosed location
there is an open contract on his head
the fbi denied him a pension
the irs assessed him in back taxes and penalties
