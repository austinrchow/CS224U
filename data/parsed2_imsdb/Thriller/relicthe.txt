the relic early draft by amy holden jones a screenplay by amy holden jones based on the book by douglas preston and lincoln child march a taxi careens down narrow
roadways at breakneck speeds
in the back seat is whittlesley
early s the wreck of a once handsome man
scratches on his arms a fresh scar on one cheek
as the taxi roars downhill towards the harbor whittlesley leans over the front seat
italics indicate portuguese to be subtitled faster
we wont make it
you want to die
whittlesley pulls out a knife puts it to the drivers jugular vein
sweat pouring down his brow the driver re doubles his speed
the taxi swerves around a corner nearly crashing into a fruit cart flies out of sight
light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters
we hear faint laughter leavened with portuguese phrases distant calypso music from waterfront bars
one of the smaller boats the santa lucia is loading as the taxi fishtails to a halt
whittlesley gets out sees the boat still at dock
his face floods with relief
he tosses a handful of bills into the drivers lap sprints up the pier as the driver shouts curses after him in portuguese
whittlesley shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the santa lucia
the boats engines churn to life
i need to speak to the captain
where is he
the sailors hold whittlesley back
get your hands off me
im trying to save your lives you fools
several crew members murmur the word loco
hearing the commotion a squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches
thank christ somebody speaks english
you have some crates of mine on board
they were shipped by mistake to the natural history museum
we have to get them off the boat
you have i
whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair trying to keep control and appear reasonable
let me explain
i was on an expedition for the museum on the upper xingu
something horrible happened
im the only one who got out alive
i lost everything my i
i have to make sure no one else dies
the crates the crates were sent out before we knew
theres something unspeakable inside
if your boat leaves harbor with those crates on board i cant be responsible
my god if they reach new york
whittlesleys fists clench spasmodically
franco looks to his men
im not crazy
as god is my witness im telling the truth
franco barks an order and several sailors grab whittlesley by the arms
they start to lead him back to shore
dont do this
you have to believe me
your lives are in danger
the sailors laugh
but with an almost super human strength born of desperation whittlesley throws them off
he pulls out his wallet
cash you see
whittlesley throws the money down on the deck
the breeze scatters the bills across the bow and all the men including captain franco scramble for the money chattering in portuguese
while they are occupied whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck
whittlesley ducks between cages of goats boxes of farm equipment his movements jerky with panic
as he continues searching the camera moves past him into the darkness of the hold
we hear whittlesley mumbling between low ragged breaths
at the back of the boat the camera finds
a stack of crates
clearly labeled natural history museum
move in on these as
the crates vibrate
the boat has started to move
whittlesley stands bolt upright realizing whats going on
he turns to run back on deck but then stops sniffs the air
a look of desperation fills his eyes
with one hand he pulls out the knife and unexpectedly puts it to his own neck
better to kill himself than face what comes next
the knife touches
necklace of two arrows one gold another silver
whittlesley stares wide eyed into the blackness of the hold
the goats start bleating in blind panic
a shaft of moonlight comes through a porthole as the boat turns
the moonlight falls on the crates
whittlesleys eyes lock onto them and he inches towards them drawn inexorably closer
he begins mumbling a prayer
move in on his eyes
filled with dread as he falls to his knees staring always staring at the crates
the crew tends to business and the santa lucia points out of the harbor disappears into the night
squad cars roar down the back roads sirens flashing
in the center of the column is an unmarked car
at the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing a simple old fashioned dark suit narrow black tie and white shirt
this is special agent pendergast fbi
a bach sonata for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck
pendergast hums along as he drives
a small town cop rides shotgun
the cop is intimidated both by pendergast and the mornings events
he sweats heavily as he brings pendergast up to date
one of the locals found it at dawn
didnt believe him till i saw it myself
even then i didnt believe it
scared my men shitless
you could smell it a half mile away mr
unperturbed any of your men go on board
none of us wanted to im the first to admit it
i said dont get within a mile of this thing
its way to big for us
im calling the fbi
pendergast nods his approval resumes humming along with a particularly intricate harpsichord riff
as always the man is unflappable and totally calm as he drives
the ocean is still the air stifling and close
a hot sun beats down on the deck of the santa lucia
the boat lists at a crazy angle where it has been washed up on the shore
at first glance it appears to be deserted
a barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each successive wave
we hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad cars pulls up
joining them now are two ambulances
pendergast gets out along with the others
all of the cops immediately cover their faces gagging violently at the smell
pendergast sniffs once and frowns
apart from this he doesnt react
choking goin up wind if you dont mind
the cops all fall back in revulsion
they watch from a safe distance as pendergast approaches the ghost ship
his shiny laced wing tips sink in the sand
he leans down pulls them off one at a time
he balls both socks puts them carefully into his shoes and proceeds barefoot towards the boat
using a piece of driftwood as a plank pendergast leans it against the santa lucia
with surprising agility he leaps up the plank to the deck
at the top he touches a rail
its covered in a dark sticky blood
flies buzz loudly
a large machete lies abandoned in the stern
chairs are overturned
a dead goat eviscerated lies in the bow
a lifeboat hangs half off the stern
pendergast moves aft
the cops watch from the sand below unwilling to get any closer
pendergast hears a door slamming open and closed
he follows the noise and sees
the door to the hold
he approaches pushes it open and looks down the stairwell
below deck are bodies
stacks of them
theyve been torn to shreds
the camera moves down to one particular man who is nearest the top of the stairs
its captain franco
his face is frozen in a howl of terror
flies congregate in the eye sockets
with his foot pendergast nudges the body over
the skull has been torn open
silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city
horns traffic construction work
new york city four months later as we
necklace of two arrows one of gold the other silver
the twin to the one seen on whittlesley
and the woman wearing the necklace
she sips her morning coffee as she makes notes on several large fossilized teeth
her hair is neatly combed
no make up
she doesnt need it
she has a natural unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap
at margos elbow is a small t
a cnn world news report plays
margos new york times is open to the crossword puzzle which shes been doing rapidly in ink
clearly this is a woman who likes order with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time
an alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the crossword puzzle makes one final note on the fossil specimens and shuts off the
she reaches for her back pack and looks out at central park with remarkably clear eyes
swooping over the fall foliage of the park a riot of color and botanical life
the camera picks out margos bicycle making its way along the winding roads dodging taxi cabs
margo wears jeans a work shirt a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone double helix pin
on her back is a leather back pack which holds her lap top computer
she emerges from the park catches the green light and rolls up to
as margo arrives the camera moves up and over the building comes to rest on the imposing turrets intersecting roof lines and gothic arches of the museum of natural history
this is not an ordinary building its a th century monument to science and mankind
the structure fills an entire city block
happy visitors pour into the museum as margo takes the imposing wide stone steps two at a time
we hear screams of pleasure and release the normal raucous noises of a large group of third grade children
margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids
their teacher mrs
beasley a stern woman in glasses with a thick new york accent calls after them as they all head inside
dont run children
stay with your partner and do not run
if anyone runs they will be sent back to the bus
beasley two boys charge past margo
henry and larry
henry has a buzz cut larry has rasta dread knots
both are years old wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles
what did i just say
you walk right this minute
did you hear me
reluctantly henry and larry slow to a rapid race walk as they reach the huge doorway flanked by two northwest coast indian totem poles
above the doorway workmen are hanging a large banner
it reads the school children burst into a three story space dominated by a life sized statue of a herd of elephants
the kids chatter with excitement look up in awe
margo nods to a guard who smiles as she pins on a plastic i
henry watches margo pass through the turnstiles without paying
he swaggers over
you work here
yes i do
what do you do
leans down amused im an evolutionary biologist
what do you do
im in third grade
whats a revolutionary what cha ma callit
i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years
brightens way cool
then you know where the dinosaurs are
fourth floor west wing but stay with your class
beasley heads into the museum and larry and henry merge with the rest of the kids
margo turns towards the stairwell passing
a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who dresses and thinks like a banker
hired for his amazing ability to raise money cuthbert is one of a new generation of museum directors whose focus must always be on the bottom line
everything ready for the opening of the superstition exhibit
im on my way to get the last piece out of storage right now
id wish you luck but im not superstitious
you will be after tomorrow night
cuthbert waves merrily
a workman uses a ladder in the stairwell
cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder stops and carefully walks around it instead
margo smiles goes on upstairs
cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell
he is now in one of the hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general public
he follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined with rumbling steam pipes
there are storage areas on both sides labeled ornithology herpitology central asia expeditions akeley expeditions whale bone fossils and so on
finally cuthbert comes to a door marked whittlesley expeditions
cuthbert pauses and gets out a key but to his surprise the door pushes open
the lock and doorknob mechanism are both broken off
he goes inside
cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall narrow space
stacks of metal shelves reach up into the gloom
everywhere we see spears shields masks various artifacts
ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in plastic like corpses against the walls
and in the middle of the gloom sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are
the whittlesley crates
the same ones last seen in the hold of the ill fated santa lucia
they are scattered about in disarray
one in particular has been broken open its contents spread on the floor
cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay kneels by the crate
no it cant be
cuthbert feels gently through the packing material lets out a sigh of relief as he pulls out a figurine
it is a small beautifully carved statue of a monster crouched on all fours
the room falls totally silent as cuthbert studies the relic
its a truly frightening piece
massive razor sharp claws large round nostrils enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes
suddenly cuthbert sees a drop of blood on his hand
hes been cut
cuthbert rises shakes his finger in pain
blood drips on the floor
he pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound
the handkerchief rapidly soaks through
suddenly a hand clamps on cuthberts shoulder
hes not alone
he lets out a yelp almost dropping the relic and spins to see
a museum guard standing behind him
his nameplate reads
hes a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling southern accent
you scared me half to death
im sorry sir
someone broke into this room
doesnt look like it
were damned lucky
this statue is priceless
cuthbert holds up the relic of the monster
a south american warrior deity
he carries a powerful curse
every member of the expedition that found this statue died
beauregard sees cuthberts cut finger
looks like the curse is still at work
the claws are sharp
i must have cut myself
uneasy laugh better move these crates to the secure storage area where theyll be safe
beauregard studies the door as cuthbert heads out with the figurine
dont know if itll do any good mr
no one broke into this room sir
someone broke out
that lock was torn off from the inside cuthbert glances at the evil face of mbwun pales
as he exits hold on beauregard left alone with the crates
huge centrifuges hissing autoclaves electrophoresis apparati glowing monitors elaborate blown glass distillation columns and titration set ups
one of the most advanced technical facilities of its kind
and mixed in with all the modern machinery are skeletons of all kinds
complete homo sapien specimens are scattered around the room
standing midst all this is gregory kawakita early twenties
kawakita makes sharp jerky overhead movements with his left hand waving something about
hes practicing casting
we hear the zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as margo enters
a fly whips out passing right under her nose
third from the end
aleut provenance unknown
the fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third skeleton from the end labeled aleut provenance unknown
margo rolls her eyes and kawakita smiles with pride
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod id have my phd
small smile but at what a price
kawakita reels in his line as margo drops her backpack on her large desk
an enormous microscope stands by the equally imposing computer topped by a tiger skull
a screen saver of an animated pterodactyl plays
margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth hits some keys revealing columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer screen
i have the species identification on these teeth
we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program
he wanted a demonstration
margo you havent heard
frocks been fired
margo straightens stunned
awkward im sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings but you know me
i got the definitive word from cuthberts secretary
this is dr
frocks last week
margo is already out the door
margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower
she half runs down an elegant edwardian fifth floor corridor her footsteps lost in the thick carpet
at the very end is a heavy oak door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply dr
margo bursts into the unique office which is in startling contrast to the modernity of her own
two large bow windows look out over the park
upholstered victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint carpets featuring large red roses
plant specimens and drawings of flora and fauna line the walls
cardboard boxes cover the floor
seated in a wheelchair is a white haired man in a tweed jacket and a loud floral tie
glasses slip down his nose
this is dr
frock and hes in the middle of packing
he looks up smiles apologetically
sorry about the mess
is it true
greg said youd been fired
bit of a shock
but as cuthbert so tactfully put it the museum needs new blood
and since ive been here since the mesozoic era i dont believe it
now margo dont overreact
cuthbert has to cut costs somehow
my leaving makes perfect sense
this isnt exactly early retirement
ive overstayed the party a bit
we cant do without you
youre one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology
youre practically an institution around here
that apparently is the problem
im yesterdays news
who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants
monsters and dinosaurs cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm
frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and margo moves to his side
she pulls frocks books back out of the box returns them to his desk
phyletic transformation and the tertiary fern spike is not going anywhere
ill talk to cuthbert and put a stop to this right now
she starts for the door and frock wheels into her path
now for the first time she sees what hes been carefully hiding
the deep pain in his eyes
dont humiliate me further
let me help
i can take care of everything
this is one problem you cant solve
you have to stay out of it
the fact is i want to retire
how can you say that
you know its not true
yes it is
im tired and im no longer needed my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you
with all due respect dear thats bull
you dance rings around me with your new technology
youve left me in the dust
stubbornly loyal your work is highly relevant
what about your display on primitive pharmacology
cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit
healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art
frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says the discussion is over
ill walk you back to the elevator
im not giving up
frock rolls back down the hall the way margo just came
margo is beside him downcast
shes not used to defeat
this isnt a death sentence
greg has promised to teach me fly fishing
you are this museum
it wont be the same without you
everyone needs a change of scenery
ive been rolling down these halls for forty odd years
thats quite enough
margo gets in the elevator reluctantly
he smiles and meets her eye
ill see you at lunch
he waves her off merrily
but once the doors close and margos out of sight frocks smile fades and his shoulders sag
he ducks his wheelchair quickly into the hall of african mammals
two stories high dark and dramatic
a very special display
dioramas of lions hippos wart hogs etc
in the middle is a large statue of a gorilla beating its chest
frock takes refuge in the darkness of the exhibit
his wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly wipe the back of his hands across his eyes
shells and sea life line the walls
a sign announces the exhibit mollusks and our world
the third grade class sweeps in
larry and henry start to sing mollusks and our world to the tune of welcome to our world the f
schwartz theme song
beasley shoots them the evil eye and henry whines
beasley its almost time to go and we still havent seen the dinosaurs
if you ask me about the dinosaurs once more iii strangle you both
she starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone
henry and larry hang back
whispers this room sucks
shes never going to take us to see the dinosaurs
that lady said they were on the fourth floor
lets ditch and find them ourselves
they dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs
larry and henry emerge and walk wide eyed among the cases of lizards chameleons tortoises
high windows light the room
outside the sun is going down
a woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys have the hall to themselves
look at this
a komodo dragon
as larry checks out the huge dragon like reptile which has just sunk its jaws into a stuffed boar
henry points to a stuffed gecko climbing vertically up the side of its case
check out this one
it can walk up walls
larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room
painting is in progress
scaffolding just begs to be climbed
henry runs over and starts up the scaffolding
were not supposed to go back there
this is a great short cut
henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and larry follows
in a moment both disappear from sight
windowless and dark
a closed display under maintenance
thousands of little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling white cotton poking out of sightless eyes
henry and larry enter and slow down
larrys getting scared
i dont want to go this way
dont be a wuss
the boys continue onward more slowly their footfalls echoing in the silence
the children are now far from the other tourists and their class
larry is frightened
the hall takes a sharp dog leg ending in a darkened cul de sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved masks
against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which looks much like a wall
henry tugs at it and the barricade moves
he looks behind
hey theres a secret staircase back here
henry disappears behind the barricade leaving larry completely alone in the dark room with the shaman masks
henry come back
henry doesnt respond
the lights in the cases throw strange shadows
larry starts to sniffle falls to hiccuping sits down
he pulls on a little flap of rubber thats coming off the toe of his sneaker all bravado gone
larry rises and peeks behind the barricade
he sees the circular stair
it descends into total darkness
from below comes a strange smell that makes larrys nose wrinkle
larry puts his first foot on the stair
with no other option but staying alone in the dark larry follows henry down
larry clutches the banister whispers
where are you
larry takes another step
below him he hears snuffling rather like a large dog
larry freezes starts to cry
it smells awful
are you all right
larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions
he pauses near the bottom of the stairs eyes wide holding his breath
there appears to be a darker area of shadow at the end of the hall
its gliding towards them
suddenly something closes on larrys leg and he yelps
henry pulls larry the rest of the way down the stairs
they stand alone together in the darkness
what is it
i dont know
but i think its bad
they keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as they back up step by step
move in as their faces suddenly twist with fear
scream bloody murder
the sound echoes in the darkness as we
margo sits up in the darkness gasping
moonlight cuts across the bed
it takes a moment for her to realize that shes had a nightmare
she reaches for her light
as she switches it on we see a photo on her bedside table
it shows a group on a mountain in tibet
there are several people with their arms slung around each other
at the end is a younger margo holding hands with john whittlesley
they appear to be more than friends
she looks at the photo a moment then turns off the light and lies back alone in her bed
yellow crime tape encircles the museum
dead leaves swirl in clusters and the sky is overcast
overnight fall turned to winter
the front of the museum is ringed with police cars
margo rides up on her bike and pauses startled at the sight
we watch as she crosses has a few words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance
she wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up
a taxi cab arriving at the front entrance
out steps special agent margo enters
the huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved from the trunk of a single tree
inside it are mannequins of northwest coast indians
milling around are at least twenty cops
worried margo hands it over
whats going on
all employees are to go to the imax room for a briefing dr
several cops go by with tracking dogs
margo looks back at the dogs increasingly uneasy almost bumps into
henry and larry
surprisingly they are alive and well and seated with mrs
beasley outside an office
margo exchanges a look with both boys remembering them from yesterday
a tentative smile starts but henry and larry dont return it
serious and chastened they drop their eyes
margo continues on
two cops stand outside the door to the rest room their backs turned to margo as she approaches
what was that
margo glances past them to see an older man wearing the badge of a night watchman leaning over a sink
he wipes his mouth
margos eyes move down to see
the mans sneakers are soaked in blood
more cops gather surrounded by skeletons of primates
humans monkeys gorillas
its an odd sight
they all look up with interest as in walks the imposing figure of
special agent pendergast
he turns to a young eager beaver officer bailey flashes his badge
bailey straightens to attention
could you please take me to the officer in charge
pendergast follows bailey as they descend the rickety old metal staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum
the hall below them is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb
the stairway opens onto a maze like set of rooms in the basement
everything around them is streaked and spattered in blood
there are trails of it on the floor the walls the overhead light
several cops stand guard as detective vince dagosta goes over the area
he is a round balding man with an unmistakable air of authority
a modern knight in shining armor in disguise
he has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt
his t shirt is plainly visible underneath
on his worn plastic belt is a badge
dont touch anything until the s
has finished with those stairs
keep everyone clear of the perimeter
i dont want any contamination
theres an incredible amount of blood evidence down here
we need more light
wheres the photographer
tell him to quit eating donuts i need him
as pendergast enters dagosta looks up at this serious african american in simple black suit white shirt and dark tie
who are you
special agent pendergast
am i out
not at all
i think we may be working on the same case
if so i could use your help
the two men shake hands
they couldnt be more different
pendergast is an elegant intellectual
dagosta a working class spark plug who operates from the gut
pendergast gestures to the form on the ground
whats left of it
mind if i have a look
dagosta calls to a police photographer who comes down the staircase carrying lights a donut stuffed in his mouth
we need light in here stat
wheres the head
dagosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball thats in the corner
that mess on the ground is brains
night watchman who found the body
sweet old man
been tossing his cookies for over an hour
not a likely suspect
the photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with light
and now everyone but not us gets a very clear look at the body
spits out his donut
his eyes roll up and he drops in a dead faint
just like that
dagosta swallows hard
pendergast looks down utterly impassive
yes id say were definitely working on the same case
an old th century theater
it looks like the theater where lincoln was shot with the exception of the most recent addition an imax screen five stories high
the room is filling with museum employees all murmuring anxiously
margo sits down next to frocks wheelchair
her face is ashen
frock i just saw a man back there whod been wading in blood
as greg kawakita sits in the chair next to margo
for once im glad youre rumor central
what in the world is going on
someones been murdered
not shot strangled or stabbed either
torn limb from limb
theres talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal
for heavens sake greg someones been killed
look its cuthbert
lets hear what really happened
at this everyone falls silent and ian cuthbert steps forward to address the crowd
he appears drawn and grey
this has been a tragic and upsetting morning
i have terrible news for us all
a member of our security force has been found murdered
the police have just informed me it was daniel beauregard
murmuring fills the room quiet
with the help of our head of security mr
the museum has been secured
rises in the back and nods to the crowd
hes an imperious looking pompous man with shifty eyes
right now hes defensive
overnight his job is on the line
the police are satisfied were in no danger that were all perfectly safe
weve been asked to remain in the gem room and be available for questioning for the rest of the day
obviously we will all do everything we can to cooperate
are there any questions
ippolito raises a hand
the party for the opening of the superstition exhibit
i imagine in the light of whats happened it will be pushed back
no action has been taken yet
the opening of the exhibit is crucial to the financial health of this museum
so for now we expect that the superstition exhibit will open on schedule tomorrow night
ippolito registers surprise
the audience buzzes again
frock and greg kawakita enter
the room is full of spectacular displays of gemstones of every type
greg drapes himself over a grey sofa
margo leans on a giant geode
what a piece of work
someones dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit
cuthberts counting on the exhibitions success
the museum is in debt
contributions and public funding have dried up
admissions no longer cover overhead
the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit
cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red
if the superstition exhibit isnt lucrative hell have to start auctioning off some of these gems
with all this bad publicity its no wonder he looks like that
they glance over and see cuthbert in the corner
he appears ill is compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a rabbits foot
frock goes over to speak to him followed by margo and greg
are you okay
shakes his head beauregard
i cant believe it
i may have been the last one to see him alive
he was with me just yesterday when i got out the statue of mbwun
taken aback mbwun
sensing more gossip whats that
margo frowns suddenly uneasy
she and dr
frock exchange a look
warrior deity of the kothoga an extinct south american tribe
john whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of mbwun
the statue is said to carry a curse
she looks away quiet every member of whittlesleys expedition died
i got the relic out yesterday to put on display
beauregard was there
the crates had been broken into and the contents were strewn about
but nothing was missing
it was downright weird
we joked that it was the curse of mbwun
im not laughing now
we all know youre superstitious
but youre among scientists here
we deal in facts
that statue had nothing to do with what happened to beauregard
all i know is everyone who has come in contact with that relic is dead
dagosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks and chairs
the room is on the ground floor with a view of the park
gawkers are outside looking in
dagosta pulls the blinds in their faces
mutters get a life
pendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds that line the walls
an original roger tory peterson of a red breasted merganser
i have a copy of this in my office at home
cant really focus on birds at the moment pendergast
im tryin to keep my breakfast down
in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things
after hours of course
on duty i smoke
he pulls out a fat cigar do you mind
not at all
i enjoy the smell of a good cigar
then you wont like this one
its a piece of shit
he bites off the end spits it out on the floor
lieutenant call me vince
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago
twelve bodies on board
out of brazil wasnt it
thats my case
now its yours
all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way
limbs torn to shreds
it looked like the work of a large animal but there was no sign of an animal on board
so the method of death is the only connection
there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat
bailey enters interrupts
this wont wait
it better be good
there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder
claimed they saw a monster
theyre pretty determined to tell you their story
you want to see them
rolls his eyes no
if you dont mind this could be important
a modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the purpose of interrogation
seated on small chairs at a plain table are
henry and larry looking like two little boys with a story they are desperate to share
standing behind them is mrs
beasley starchier than ever
dagosta takes a chair across from the boys at their eye level
by this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired
pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind
this isnt hard duty for dagosta
hes surprisingly genial and at ease with kids
larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in excitement
henry tugs his t shirt
im lieutenant dagosta
you can call me vince
this is special agent pendergast
you can call him
he looks to pendergast so formal special agent pendergast
this is henry weiss and larry bowers
tell us about this monster
we were lost and trying to find a short cut to the dino henry elbows him hard
larry shuts up
we were just lost okay
and we went down this curvy staircase
at the bottom was a big shadow
big as a house
not that big
depends which house
it smelled like old hamburger and it made this weird noise
henry makes a low growl in his throat
dagosta suppresses a smile shoots pendergast a look
but pendergast watches the kids intently
and it snuffled the ground like a dog
he goes on hands and knees sniffs the ground
it had a long tongue teeth this big and yellow eyes
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizards
they were yellow
youre color blind
to dagosta these two get in a lot of mischief and they tell some amazing whoppers
i can see that
this isnt a whopper
its the truth
pendergast now moves forward pulls up a chair as if deeply interested
how did you get away
we ran and screamed and stuff
and we got through a little door just in time
there was a guard there and he went back to check
do you remember his name
he was wearing one of those i
his name was bo
an ambulance pulls away lights flashing
pendergast and dagosta walk to a squad car
ive got to admit that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework
how do you explain the part about beauregard
they heard the victims name and wove him into their story
i believed them
dagosta stops stunned
you think what weve got here is a monster as big as a house that smells
i think what weve got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon
who wants us to believe hes a monster
totally confused oh
dagosta and pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies on gurneys
its dark and quiet
they go into the autopsy room
a large gurney currently empty sits like an uninvited guest under the bright lights of the autopsy suite
beside it is a tall imposing doctor in her late s with intense eyes
this is dr
with her are the photographer seen passing out at the museum and a young intern doctor gross
youre late vince
this is special agent pendergast
she runs the best chop shop in new york
the hacksaw murders
who could forget
afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte
i hope you liked it
after our last case vince took me out for a draft beer
as i recall we split the check
grumbles its been one of those days
she snaps her rubber glove shall we get down to it then
gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a drawer
the shape under the plastic seems too small to be human
to the side of it is a large bump presumably the head
the two pieces of cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights
a stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurneys outlet pipe
ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body she taps it and it gives off the proper static
for the microphone this is dr
matilda ziewzic assisted by dr
six fifteen p
we are joined by lieutenant vincent dagosta of the nypd special agent pendergast of the fbi and a police photographer
lets see what weve got
they pull off the sheet and dagosta swallows hard closes his eyes to keep his stomach in check
the photographer goes green but is determined not to clutch this time
pendergast leans closer totally impassive
he puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses assumes an expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant
height well i cant give a height because mr
beauregard has been decapitated
the state of the body is such that other identifying marks are out of the question
there are numerous lacerations proceeding from the left anterior pectoral downwards through the sternum and terminating in the abdomen
this is a massive wound two feet long and a foot wide
the head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed
it almost looks like
beat a bite
ziewzic turns to pendergast
what are we talking about here
someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa
back to work the entire brain appears to have been extracted
may i see it please
gross passes over a grey watery mass that sits in a stainless steel pan
ziewzic studies beauregards brain or whats left of it
theres something missing
the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps
looks up surprised yes
two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision
what happened to them
if you dont mind a suggestion you might try a saliva test
ziewzic gross and dagosta look at pendergast
the photographer is staring at the wall silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep from woofing all over the place
incredulous saliva test
you mean you think someone ate part of the brain
a long moment of silence then
zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva test puts the result in a petrie dish
one saliva test
lets look at these lacerations
they start wide and then converge
perhaps some kind of weapon
im now probing the wound and
theres a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle lodged on a rib
the photographer gathers his courage steps forward with dagosta and pendergast
zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile water
it turns brownish red
she holds it up
they all stare in astonished silence
its a claw
the photographers flash goes off
a black and white heads uptown
pendergast sits in silence
dagosta is visibly disturbed
i dont like animals
dog bit me when i was little
after that i gave up on pets
animals are irrational
give me a psychotic killer any day
if theres one thing that makes me queasy its being part of a food chain
my first case as a rookie two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo
it was late august
the polar bear was inside his cave
kids didnt know he was in there
all they saw was the pool
they got to swimming and splashing
the noise woke up the bear
by the time i arrived both little boys were in pieces
the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot
i can still hear the mother screaming this isnt an animal vince
ive been on this case four months remember
ive learned a few things
youve been holding out on me pendergast
you have a suspect capable of this
pendergast looks over nods quietly
let me tell you about it vince
the yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain
most of the emergency vehicles have left
the police have released the employees who are now headed home
we see frock and kawakita exit
cuthbert isnt far behind
pendergast approaches them headed back inside
you must be joking
shes in the physical anthro lab making up for lost time
pendergast nods his thanks
the gems glow in the darkness as pendergast passes through the now empty room
pendergasts footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far stairs
pendergast goes down a long dark hall alone
he arrives at a door marked physical anthropology lab enters
the skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling
margos computer screen glows at the end of the room casting the only light
but her chair is empty
the room is quiet
pendergast approaches slowly looks around
pendergast glances at the computer screen sees graphs and complicated notations
he scrolls down leans closer
he cant figure it out
he slides into margos chair fascinated
you have a warrant to look at that
pendergast leaps up
margo has appeared in the doorway behind him a cup of coffee in her hand
special agent pendergast
i guess i was snooping
what is this
an invention of mine
its a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna
i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator
how does it work
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it
hunted how big it was
abrupt you arent here for a lesson in dna
a moment i came to talk about dr
margo turns to put down her coffee
she takes a moment to compose herself
when she turns back her voice is quiet
somehow when all this happened
i knew it would come back to john
is he really dead
if he were alive hed have contacted me
you have time to talk
pendergast and margo walk together though various exhibits and halls
they pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and stuffed behind glass
whittlesley was last seen in belem venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared
a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat
that boat washed up in my district
everyone on board was killed
his body wasnt among the victims
i dont understand
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten
just like beauregard
one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision
the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact
john couldnt have anything to do with a horrible thing like that
he was a fine man despite his problems you loved him
a moment taken aback yes
we met at columbia
john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there
you were going to be married
how did you know that
i ran an internet search on dr
got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times
i also found a record of your restraining order
that was two years ago
john was still in love with me
she looks down he wouldnt leave me alone
you were afraid of him werent you
he was afraid of himself
he tried suicide once
he was ill
he had wild emotional highs and lows
not a happy affliction for a scientist
hed been revered in our community
by the end he was a joke
tell me about the last expedition
what was he looking for
a legendary monster called mbwun
he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect
it held that evolution wasnt always gradual or driven by natural selection
the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a monster species
it made no sense
but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years
no one knows
the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals
margos voice catches again
pendergast reaches for his handkerchief but she shakes her head determined to keep control
im all right
i wont let this affect me anymore
john wouldnt get help
his ego endangered the lives of others
his theory came first
what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there
was he desperate enough to create one
i dont understand
something came up in autopsy tonight
imbedded in beauregards body we found a claw
then it was an animal
i dont think so
i think we were meant to think it was mbwun
did whittlesleys monster have claws
i dont know
he sent back a statue thats supposed to be an exact representation
but ive never seen it
its in the exhibit
would you mind showing it to me
this exhibit is unlike anything weve seen in the museum
horrifying artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness
patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls
there are tombs a torture chamber and endlessly curving maze like winding halls
where would we find it
im not sure
we should split up
you take that hall and ill take this one
im as macho as you are
without further discussion margo takes the right fork leaving pendergast behind
as she finds herself alone
the silence is intense
she heads slowly into another long dark tunnel passing a set of maori tattooed heads
the eyes are stuffed with fibers the shriveled lips are drawn back from rotting teeth
margo passes without a look
in another part of the exhibit he nears a mayan tomb
a skeleton in the center wears a headdress and tribal robes
gold rings encircle bony fingers
pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it heads into the next hall
getting farther from pendergast and ever deeper into the gloom
the walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft
there are shaman dancers masks covered in grasses and shells
from the new guinea coast there is kokpah god of a secret male society and zoe ba an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask
finally the walls open up into another gallery
beyond it is more of the shadowy hall
margo stops and for the first time she wavers
this gallery is the most frightening yet
it features images of the devil from different cultures around the world
in the dim light margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of satan tornarsuk the eskimo evil spirit incubi from india tibet new guinea etc
and there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar and lit by a spot is a small figurine
margo is instantly drawn to it
as she gets close enough she sees the label in gothic letters
savage god of the kothoga also known as he who walks on all the statue is terrifyingly life like
margo stares at the beast
mbwun is covered in scales and stiff hair with glittering green eyes and crude reptilian features
the figure is hunched over in a threatening crouch
its long forearms trail to the ground ending in three large on margo
she starts then remembers pendergast
i found it
she turns tries again louder
over here her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air
a stench rolls over her
she covers her face backs up holding her breath
she steps directly into a nasty statue of the tibetan lord of the dead
margo starts steadies the statue
the room is silent once more
but then unmistakably
she hears it
an odd rustling sound
maddeningly soft on the thick carpet
and another wave of the smell
margo looks in the direction she came down the long dark hall
her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls
no answer whos there
but now she freezes
at last shes truly scared
a shadow black against black is gliding stealthily towards her moving over the display cases and grinning artifacts
margo stands stock still her eyes on the shadow
she lets out a small gasp of shock
she cant believe her eyes
it defies reason
slowly she backs up
she slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other side
in the next room she pauses again listens
now hearing a distinctly animal snuffling sound
something large is tracking her
theres no doubt
overcome by a blind panic margo turns and runs
she passes through a display on mythical creatures disappears down another winding dark hall
behind her comes
the pounding of something in a heavy loping run
whatever it is its charging after her
she turns another corner
and another tearing as fast as she can
but now the walls up ahead are narrowing leading to a dead end
margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass
the hall features displays of terrifying totem poles
all around the ghoulish carved faces seem to leap out
she pounds on the door but its useless
and the thing is coming behind her
its just around the last bend when it stops
silence again envelops her
shes afraid to turn
she can hear heavy breathing and something like a low growl
reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long dark hall
margo starts as a face appears in the reflection
the image is wavering and unclear
its a large hulking form behind her
two glowing slit green eyes in the dark
margo screams as the thing leaps forward hitting one of the totem poles
margo sinks to the ground unconscious
at last we hear pendergast calling as darkness falls
lying on the carpet
theres a large nasty bump on her forehead
the totem pole is on the floor beside her
leaning over her is pendergast
margo starts to sit up
pendergast gently restrains her
i dont know
i heard you calling and i ran after you but you kept disappearing and i couldnt keep up
she touches her forehead you were behind me
running after me
as margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him off collecting her thoughts
its okay im all right
i remember now
it was an animal
i could smell it
it was hunting me
i saw two green eyes in the dark
where did you see it
margo turns and points behind her to
a large northwest coast indian mask
its carved out of wood in a horrible grimace inset with two glowing green eyes
pendergast sees it too says nothing
thats not what i saw
if youre positive
she leans against the wall touches her forehead panic overcoming her again
i cant think straight at the moment
i know how crazy this seems
pendergast i need some fresh air
could you get me out of here
three cops including mcnitt rodriguez and rogers prepare to enter the exhibit
all are armed
margo watches as pendergast gives them instruction
she appears rattled and confused
stay in formation together
take it room by room
check for footprints any signs of disturbance
if you see or hear anything the least bit suspicious i want to know
he points to doyle an older red haired cop who takes up a post outside the exhibit
pendergast hands doyle his walkie talkie
baileys going to be in the guard house outside
officer van dorn is right down that hall
when mcnitts done hell relieve you
pendergast and margo walk out
margo and pendergast exit
the cold air is like a slap in the face
i didnt imagine it
i know what i saw
are you sure there are enough men in there
theyre all heavily armed
stops all right
this is hard for me
im a scientist
i like order and logic
sometimes too much
theres got to be an explanation
there cant be an animal in there
but i saw something
what was it
i dont know
she has a thought mr
do me a favor
get me a dna readout on that claw
all is quiet
the doors to the exhibit are closed
doyle looks at his watch impatient
its almost eleven now
he pulls out his walkie talkie
im still waiting outside the exhibit
where the hell is mcnitt
should be there any minute
they came out a side door a while ago
said the exhibits clear
mcnitts headed back to spell you
im on double over time man
you can go home if you want to
ill come relieve you myself
doyle shuts off his walkie talkie frowns
he fidgets looks at his watch once more
what the hell
he turns takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it but then he hears something stops
its a low scuffling from inside the exhibit coming from behind the closed doors
doyle freezes turns
his hand goes to his gun for reassurance as he hears a footstep and a muffled thump
he moves to the door of the exhibit opens it and takes a step inside
cut the crap
i know its you
youre not scaring me
silence meets him
the shadows of the exhibit loom
doyle takes one more step inside scanning the darkness with his gun
does he hear breathing
yes he does
the hair on his neck rises and he loses the spit in his mouth
he takes a step backwards but hes half a second too late
the door slams behind him and a huge dark form officer mcnitt enters from a side corridor zipping up his fly
the hall is still
mcnitt checks his watch sees doyles walkie talkie and turns it on
im outside the exhibit
but i dont see doyle
he called a minute ago looking for you
he starts vacation tomorrow and he wanted out
i said you were on the way
he could split
well hes gone
any sign of a green eyed monster
mcnitt shuts off the walkie talkie settles at his post
in the blackness a large shape is moving quietly dragging its prey across the floor
we move in on the lifeless form of doyle
his face is rigid with terror his eyes frozen open wide
the last thing we hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness is the snapping of doyles skull
signs announce that the superstition exhibit opens tonight
the museum is back in business but not many people are going in
a crowd lingers at the margins pointing at the building
several hold a copy of the post with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair
cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office looking out at the scene below
his face is pinched with worry
slumped in a chair is lieutenant dagosta
pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesis forum sketches
if you like them theyre for sale
another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block
ive read about the museums financial troubles
weve been operating in the red for years
that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit
it was designed to pull people in
weve spent every penny we have on advance publicity betting everything on the openings success
if we postpone at the last minute
i dont want to think about that
chews on his toothpick mild we all love the museum
i come here myself with my kids
were trying to work with you
i appreciate that
if the party goes forward and thats a big if
ive arranged for a large police presence
do they have to wear uniforms
i dont want to scare people
cuthbert weve got bigger problems
depending on what we find today we may have to shut you down
cuthbert looks grim
dagosta examines the huge centrifuges autoclaves electrophoresis apparati monitors computers etc
as margo and greg kawakita look at the claw
what do you make of it margo
its not mammalian thats for sure
i think its reptilian
that would jive with what we got from the preliminary dna read out
here have a look
he hands them a computer read out
margo checks it quickly as kawakita looks on
according to this twenty five percent of the claw dna is unidentifiable about a third is homo sapien and the rest is hemidactylus turcicus
looks over whats that
margo pulls off her glasses
turkish gecko i believe
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand
the sample must be contaminated
theres another possibility
a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage
when dna is defective it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair
viruses can damage dna
so can radiation certain chemicals
lets let the g
sort it out
i have to get started
this will take several hours
we need someone to take us to the secure storage area
hes the curator of plant biology
all the curators have keys
and he knows every inch of this museum
the rest of us still get lost
pendergast dagosta and dr
frock get off are in an older plain corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors
the doors are numbered up to eight then the corridor turns
as the three go forward the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly in the hall
thank you for taking the time to help us with this dr
happy to be useful
its rare enough these days
according to security beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area
how many storage areas are there
they fill seven floors
we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world
just to give you an idea there are more than three million insects specimens
not to mention amphibians reptiles birds anthropological artifacts meteorites minerals and gems
only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display
this place is a maze
im one of the few who know every inch it now that john is gone
looks over do you mean dr
john made quite a study of the whole museum
he had a copy of my original plans
frock heads through a double door that leads to a freight elevator thats as big as a small room
the operator karl has it decorated with a table chair and pictures
osteo prep karl
the doors creak closed
they are now inside
dagosta chews on a toothpick stares at karls home made picture show
the photos have all been cut from nature magazines
they are of animals mating in extreme positions and undreamed of ways
dagosta turns to pendergast dead pan
my kind of art
karl who is sixty and wears a red toupee leers
they keep me company
gets kinda lonely sometimes
my favorite is the two camels
im partial to the skunks
finally the doors open and they exit to a hail enter another set of doors
now they are in it looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else
deep stainless steel tanks line one wall
on the ceiling near the tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger carcasses
in a far corner of the workshop is a stainless steel gurney bearing a dead gorilla
a pink faced eighty year old man is working on the carcass with sharp tools
this is don osterbaan
did you ever wonder where we get all our skeletons
this is the laboratory where animal carcasses are reduced to bones
to osterbaan whats cooking today don
frock looks into a large maceration tank with pendergast and dagosta
a zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface its flesh and soft tissues falling off
man thats ripe
frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room
inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox
its crawling with black beetles which are devouring it
dagosta and pendergast watch the grizzly scene properly impressed
the second method of preparing a skeleton used in natural history museums world wide
bugs are clean and highly efficient
theyll polish that fox off in no time
as don casually peels back the gorillas whole face exposing the skull
want to have a look at a gorilla brain
got one right here
were in a hurry
some other time
more rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes
the light is dim here and several bulbs are burned out
but the numbers on the storage rooms are much higher now
the three men come out of the darkness
frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop
this should be it
can you read the number
pendergast reaches up above them and taps the light bulb
it comes on and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area
dagostas jaw drops and his toothpick falls out
the door has been scored from top to bottom by long vicious claws
frock stares in amazement shaken
he runs a finger down the deep ruts
something tried to get into this room
these doors are solid steel
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum
i wouldnt be so sure
pendergast takes frocks keys and opens the door
it swings wide on oiled hinges
dagosta turns on a light
they all enter
nothing has been disturbed
the crates sit in the middle of the small room untouched
pendergast kneels by the only one thats been opened
this must be the one that held the statue
lets see what else is inside
pendergast removes the lid and hands it to dagosta pulls out a blow dart gun seed pods a carved stone
dagosta takes the lid and turns it
the lid of this crate is scratched with claw marks just like the door
as dagosta studies the lid a brittle water damaged envelope slips out
dagosta picks it up
the envelope bears an imprint of arrows one silver overlaid with another of gold look
its some kind of letter
excited may i see that
dagosta hands the letter to frock
its from john
those two arrows were his insignia
its addressed to louis moriarty a patron who financed his expeditions
read it out loud
dear louis tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where well be in the greatest danger so im sending carlos back with the crates
you always believed in me louis even in the darkest days
so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded
weve made an incredible find
i enclose a representation of mbwun
note the exaggerated claws the reptilian attributes the hints of bipedalia
its beyond belief but this statue is accurate
i know because ive seen the beast
frock stops looks up at dagosta and pendergast
his face flushes with the thrill
did you hear that
he says that mbwun is real
snorts pardon my french but bull shit
this on top of the scratches
isnt it proof
i think the scratches were put there to scare us
perhaps even lead us to this note
pendergast looks out to the dark corridors
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum
are there any hidden rooms or staircases
places where someone could hide
just the sub basement
dagosta and pendergast exchange a look
where is that
i dont know
it was walled over
no ones been down there in years
you said you had plans of the museum
could we see them please
a series of boxes labeled professor frock sit on the loading dock
a small moving van partially loaded with the contents of frocks office sits waiting
frock delves through one of the boxes while pendergast and dagosta look on
i know theyre here somewhere
its a good thing we caught the movers in time
theyre nineteen century blueprints from when the museum was built
i remember the sub basement was below the regular basement linked to the city sewer
i only know about it because it flooded all the way up to the museum during the hurricane of
i lost so many precious books
frock continues to unload boxes scattering things right and left
its the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia
a collection of wildflowers soil samples a stuffed owl
finally he pulls out some very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile
who says it doesnt pay to be a pack rat
now please be careful with these
when youre done id like them back
visitors scatter as pendergast enters with dagosta two deputies a dog handler jonathan hamm and jonathans pair of huge bloodhounds
the deputies are armed with large shotguns
pendergast scans the blueprints as they walk
how big is the sub basement
apparently its huge
i think i should come with you
we havent got time
you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight
pendergast jonathan his dogs and the deputies make their way down an industrial set of stairs into the basement
in a moment they arrive at the site of beauregards murder
the area at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk crime tape spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping in and out
these plans indicate theres a walled over entrance to the sub basement right around here
they move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the time we last saw it with henry and larry
unknown to jonathan or pendergast the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the boys faced the monster
the dogs are picking up something mr
the dogs start barking in animation sniffing the wall
pendergast studies the blueprints with a flashlight moves to the spot
theres nothing to be seen
he shines his flashlight over the water stained uneven stucco between two steel beams
the dogs sniff furiously at the point where the wall meets the floor
pendergast moves his fingers to the joint between the stucco and the beam shoves hard
the wall pushes back
its a door
they enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs
water drips on the walls
what is this
jonathan looks uneasy double wraps the dogs leashes around his black gloved hands
the two deputies remove their gauges from their shoulders
then they all follow the animals descend down the inky stairwell
the place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant
two security guards monitor a battery of closed circuit screens
dagosta is now accompanied by the pompous head of security ippolito
clearly ippolito feels dagosta is pissing on his territory and hes trying to assert control
this huge police presence tonight isnt necessary lieutenant
youll just scare people off
i can handle the security behind scenes with this system
its state of the art
the cops are non negotiable ippolito
why dont you just tell me how this space station works
its fool proof basically
i designed this whole thing myself
every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip
if anythings moved so much as an inch we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft
thats great if youre stopping a burglar
not our goal here
are there motion detectors
in every exhibition room
the museums divided into five cells
the reception and exhibit are in cell five
we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four then seal the perimeter with our fire doors
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people
youd be violating every fire regulation on the books
well guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells
one more question
i see a big hole
if this entire thing is run by computer what happens if the power fails
snorts you dont know much about computers lieutenant
there are safeguards built in
we have back up systems with redundancies
theres no way these computers can fail
margo kawakita and frock are studying the contents of the crate
i cant help thinking theres something that pendergast overlooked
if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard it wants something thats in here
a blow dart
a plant press
pretty unimpressive stuff
let me see the plant press
frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside
what is it
im not sure
as you know the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years
species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct
this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant
whatever it is it must be common on the tepui
john used it as packing material
kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers as does frock
theyre curiously fleshy
and they smell delicious
kawakita takes a nibble
i wouldnt put that in your mouth until we do a chemical analysis greg
i can handle that for you while were waiting on the g
kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant
what about those seed pods
are they from the same plant
frock takes a moment to study them looks up
margo these arent seed pods
what are they
black as night
the only light comes from the mens flashlights
theyre at a crossroads
crooked corridors with arched ceilings barely the height of a man stretch in several directions
jonathan is crouched down resting with the panting dogs
the deputies are having a smoke
they all look both uneasy and exhausted except for pendergast
he stares at the blueprints
hard to read in this light
the ink is so faded
the dogs have lost the scent mr
maybe we should head back
lets try the fork to the left
the men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on
the hounds walk ahead carelessly nosing the ground
the flashlight beams illuminate lime encrusted cave like walls
this place gives me the creeps
at this the dogs begin to whine
the hair on their backs rises in a ridge
pendergast turns as a breeze stirs his clothes
theyve got something
keep the light up
i cant see
the dogs strain and pull forward sniffing the air ahead
the deputies raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness
the flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions barely penetrating the gloom
suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying baying which bounces off the walls
shut them up
the dogs drag jonathan forward paying no attention foaming at the mouth
jonathan is now frightened
theyre going crazy
i need help
as jonathan tries to grab the collars one of the dogs leaps forward and the leash slips through jonathans hands
argo bolts into the darkness
the men start after the dog following the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance
pendergast is in the lead
suddenly he throws out his arms halts
holy mother what is that
a goatish odor envelops them all
smells god awful
like rotten meat
a scuffling sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a roar
the men all freeze
the other dog leaps and twists with excitement
in the confusion it also breaks free
it tears after the first dog disappearing into the darkness
now jonathan is wild eyed
the deputies are terrified retreat
the darkness is stifling claustrophobic
the flashlights are small help
pendergast alone remains dead calm
his voice is cool and commanding
forget the dogs
you two get back here
dont point that gun at me
the deputies regain control and follow pendergasts orders
they fall into position pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall
in the echoing darkness ahead of them the barking falters and stops
there is a moment of silence then a terrible unearthly shriek
the deputies quail frozen in their tracks
jonathan leaps forward
at that moment a shape hurtles at them from the darkness
the men yell in terror
there are two stunning blasts from the shotguns two flashes of light accompanied by a deafening roar
the rumble echoes and dies and theres an intense silence followed by a sob
you shot my dog
hobbes lies five feet from them a black shadow of death
jonathan kneels by the dog tears in his eyes
down the animals side is a gash
stammers he was coming right at me
in the distance they can hear a terrified howl
its the second dog hurt or frightened
its a pitiful sound
lets get out of here
im not going anywhere
not without my dog
pendergast grabs at jonathan who slips from his grasp
jonathan inches back down the hallway calling desperately
jonathan shakes his head no
theres something out there
lets go get it now
thats why we came down here isnt it
to the deputies hes right
but the two deputies are terrified
they cling to the wall inching backwards sheer horror in their eyes
i say we get help
a lot more guns
im ordering you
well cover you from here
jonathan is disappearing in front of them
pendergast has no choice
grim faced he pulls his colt
anaconda from a shoulder harness
its a narrow and evil looking gun
from a pocket comes a handful of grain wadcutter and grain fmj flatnose ammunition
he loads up goes after jonathan whos no longer in sight
pendergast passes down a long sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead
at the bottom pendergast stops
he has to stoop down as he goes through an archway and into
a dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going off from all sides
it appears to be part of the sewer system
the dog cowers in a corner
jonathan moves to his side
hes all right
lets get back to the others
we cant leave them alone
i can tell by the way the dogs acting that whatever was out there is gone
what is this place
not on the map
looks like it connects with the city sewer
pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies
were coming back
the words go unanswered
from the hall comes a loud report
its the shotguns blasting desperately
something flies up all around them as the sound echoes
pendergast and jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating wings
finally the animals settle and pendergast and jonathan exchange a look
the silence is filled by a soft rumbling sound
they stand together waiting
pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back to the deputies
a ridge of hair on the dogs back rises and it growls
the rumbling continues growing louder
then a dark object appears
it comes rolling out of the hallway bounces in front of them and stops
pendergast shines his light on
deputy ones head
the mouth is open wide in terror
across the cheek is a vicious claw mark
and now they hear a gut wrenching shriek thats abruptly cut off followed by a second rumbling sound
jonathan grabs pendergast by the shirt panicked
they head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to slope up
after theyre gone a few moments the head of deputy two rolls to a stop
cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance
a huge rotating spotlight is now turned on
elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain umbrellas jousting
cuthberts putting on his tux
he adjusts the cummerbund humming happily as dagosta looks on
dagosta paces highly agitated and worried
im telling you somethings wrong
i still havent heard from pendergast
i think you should call it off
its too late now
guests are arriving
the mayors car is pulling up
ill go down and speak to him
irritated you havent got the authority
only pendergast can pull the plug
pendergast may be in trouble
dont you understand
he still hasnt come back
its been over three hours hell be back
were in good shape
your security is air tight
thereve been no more incidents nothing suspicious
theres no reason to call off the opening now
resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to the hall of heavens
the palms themselves are festooned with orchids and violet lights
somewhere inside an invisible band is playing new york new york
an army of waiters in white tie thread their way through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with champagne glasses
cuthbert enters and crosses to meet the mayor and the mayors wife
photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop
food is out
hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths
decorations have a dark haunted house theme
a hum of activity floats up past the vast corinthian columns into the circular dome above
an explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant specimens
margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand greg a tissue as frock looks on
what kind of egg is it
like the claw
cautious lets not jump to conclusions
this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr
excited come on margo
were on the verge of something huge
lets consider the possibility just the three of us alone in this room
what if john was right
i mean what if
and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates
when it got to the museum it hatched
several problems with that theory
for one thing this egg is intact
for another according to pendergast the crates were shipped here on a boat
everyone on board was killed like beauregard
if the thing hatched in mid ocean where did it go
frock has no answer
greg gestures to his computer screen
i guess youre not interested in this plant anymore but the chemical analysis is done
frock reads the computer over gregs shoulder
cripes margo what did you give me
is this an animal or one funky shrub
to kawakita i see youve been programming the computer vocabulary again
points to a hexagonal symbol look at this
an ambyloid reovirus protein
that explains why the computers confused
the plants infected with a virus
thats not so unusual
many plants carry viruses
like the burls on maple trees
but a virus normally codes for other viruses
this ones making human and animal proteins
listen to this
reads glycotetraglycine collagenoid
weinsteins tropic hormone
monoxytocin supressin hormone
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones
what kind of hormones
kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf
the encyclopedia of biochemistry thumbs to a page and reads
a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland
try weinsteins tropic hormone
the tension is rising in the room
frock takes the book looks this one up reads silently and removes his glasses
a hormone secreted by the human thalamus gland
kawakita and frock look puzzled
margo rises in agitation
this is it
this is what he or it
the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victims brains
pales eats them
whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant
when the crates were put in secure storage they were out of reach
the killer couldnt get them so it got the next best thing
theres a moment of stunned silence
then a loud buzzer makes them all jump
its all right
that means the g
has finished analyzing the claw dna
greg you go find pendergast and lieutenant dagosta now
kawakita tears up the dark stairs
he turns a corner and something jumps out at him
he almost screams
its a drunk
hey where za little boys room
down that hallway
but dont stay long
you dont want to be here alone
margo and frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the printer has spit out
all right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw
she reads species unidentified
male weight in excess of kg
brain capacity centimeters
that means its highly intelligent
the other name for mbwun
he who walks on all fours
margo and frock exchange a look
margo swallows and keeps reading
external hair and bony plates
locomotor speed kilometers
reduced optic chiasm
external mucoid nasal glands
very keen scent
morphological characteristics highly robust
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night
with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear
a long moment margo what youve just described is a killing machine
and its hungry
its been two days since its eaten
there are five hundred people arriving right now
the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell
all those people in one enclosed space
its like ringing the dinner bell
the crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the mayor cuts a red ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds
cuthbert is by the mayors side
he steps forward and raises his hand for quiet
the crowd falls silent
thank you everyone and welcome
were glad all of you were willing to brave the inclement weather to be with us tonight
our special thanks to his honor the mayor and his lovely wife
the mayor takes a bow
some people have questioned whether a superstition exhibit belongs in a museum of science
spells incantations demons magic
these are forces that defy the natural laws
superstition provides answers to the great questions based on fear
science provides answers to the great questions based on truth
science and superstition then are polar opposites
mortal enemies if you will
and that is why we are here tonight
we have come to learn more about the enemy and thus to bring about its defeat
for every good there is an evil for every dark a light
and so tonight
my friends i give you ignorance terror unreasoning fear pure evil
smiles gestures to the exhibit have a great time
everyone laughs applauds again as cuthbert and the mayor lead the way inside
kawakita is making his way over to dagosta
the crush at the entrance is incredible
what is it
green has to see you
got my hands full here
you have to come
shes found out something
dagosta pulls out his walkie talkie
officer mcnitt stands in the corner of the computer room bathed in neon light
running the security system is george your basic computer nerd
multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum
most are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition
on these the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms
mcnitt holds his walkie talkie
im heading to the evolutionary bio labs
any sign of pendergast
at this moment a noise comes from the adjoining room
mcnitts head swivels
its a loud thump
hold on lieutenant
to george what was that
probably just something wrong with the air conditioning
theres a shit load of electrical rooms back there
george is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention
mcnitt returns to his walkie talkie as the thump comes again
now he looks distinctly nervous
theres something wrong in the computer room
ill get ippolito and send him up
youre over reacting
sounds like the air conditioning to me
mcnitt watches uneasily as george opens the door disappears into the next room
dagosta turns to kawakita who waits shifting from foot to foot
theres some kind of problem in the computer room
i have to go get ippolito
you wait here
dagosta heads into the exhibit before kawakita can protest
we see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms
a teenage girl lauren and her father david examine a lidless rotting european style coffin complete with corpse
a white haired gentleman dr
pound leans on his cane as he looks at a display on primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture tools
cuthbert and ippolito are at the head of a press of people giving the mayor and his wife a guided tour
here we have a very rare sacrificial table from mesoamerica
the priests would kill the victim on this slab cut out the heart and eat it while it was still beating
i could use one of these things in city hall
cuthbert laughs right on cue
they pass a congo power figure with its bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails
several people recoil from it looking repulsed
the mayors wife sees it and looks distressed
youre letting kids see this
i should think theyd have nightmares
kid will love it
theyre our target audience
nothing here is as violent as what they see on t
they pass a mummy dripping in blood
the mayor gestures to it
i dont know
that could be a little over the top
its not even scientific
mummies dont bleed
cuthberts smile fades as he sees the mummy
the mayors white cuff as he extends his hand to point at the mummy
the pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a falling red drop of blood
cuthbert sees it
so does the mayor and ippolito
they look up as another drop of blood falls right on cuthberts face
and yet another droplet falls on the mayors wifes white bosom exposed by her low cut dress
above the mummys head the top of the case is cut away exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork
a hand a watch and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the case
a small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger
and another drop falls
cuthbert screams at the top of his lungs
conscious of the panic factor ippolito yells
but its too late
the room is packed with people
and dagosta himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out
theres a body up there
a ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room titters as people wonder if its a joke
at that moment from the darkness above the ceiling buckles and something falls
its officer doyles headless torso dripping blood
utter pandemonium breaks loose
the close space echoes with screams and shouts
people claw at each other stumbling desperately trying to get to the door
a young woman falls and dagosta runs to her to keep her from being trampled in the stampede
mcnitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the chaos in the exhibition the faces registering blind fear
alarms start going off all over the place
mcnitt calls out
get out here now
mcnitt looks around desperate
but george still isnt here
the door to the electrical room is still open
the ceiling shudders from thundering feet
mcnitt can hear distant screams
its raising the hair on the back of his neck
he calls out
where are you
he moves to the open door a new fear in his eyes
he looks inside
mcnitt cant find a light switch
he stays in the doorway silhouetted by light from the computer room
with shaking hands mcnitt pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun
theres a strange low gurgling sound
its mcnitts stomach
he silences it swallows
where are you
mcnitt edges into the darkened rooms
the first ones empty
he tries the next
weve got an emergency
are you here
suddenly theres a huge thump and a scuttling to his left
its a terrifying sound
mcnitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds each with a light and a deafening blast
a shower of sparks and a gout of flame licks upwards illuminating the room with orange light
a huge dark shape ducks out the door
gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog
on the far wall a mounted metal box is smoking from three large ragged holes
with a sudden pop an electrical arc slices across the ruined box followed by a crackling and a shower of sparks
mcnitt ducks back into the computer room slams the door and locks it breathing hard
every single screen flickers and dims
but to mcnitts relief george has returned
he is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair
i saw something in there
i fired but i think i missed it
george remains still his back to mcnitt staring at the computer game on the flickering screen
george for chrissake answer me
mcnitt puts a hand on georges shoulder swivels his chair around
his face ripped off
on the central switching box
sparking and shorting as an enormous everyone pours out of the exhibit running for the door leading to the rotunda
people are getting trampled
its a terrible crush
tables over turned everywhere
food scatters to the floor
dagosta pushes his way out of the exhibit crosses to kawakita who is appalled
above the chandeliers are flickering
theres a dead body in the exhibit
people are panicking trampling each other trying to get out
ippolito runs over to join them
what the hell is going on
above them the lights dim again and come back on
the whole system is shutting down
we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall
i told you
they seal off all the cells
they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure you said the system couldnt fail
at this theres a low rumble from above
dagosta looks up and sees a large metal door is descending from a slot in the ceiling and not in an orderly fashion
its falling fast
below are crowds of people all pushing to get out
officer bailey near the door sees it
his voice is lost in an ocean of screaming
kawakita stands in total horror a moment then joins bailey and dagosta
all of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door
ippolito on the other hand elbows his way to the front of the fleeing crowd
get back here
ignoring dagosta ippolito pushes past
he barrels over an old man who stumbles and falls directly beneath the falling door
ippolito jumps over him and is out
the old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and screams
dagosta runs forward dives for the old man but hes not in time
kawakita covers his eyes unable to watch as the lights flicker a third and last time
the room is plunged into darkness
and over the screams we hear the rumble and crash the horrifying cries of the old man as the door comes down
margo and frock stand in the darkness
through a high window we can see lightning flash
whats going on
some kind of power failure
maybe its the storm
do you have a flashlight
i think so
she gets one from a cupboard
gregs been gone over a half hour
wed better get out of here
get the crate
frock wheels his chair as fast as he can
margo runs beside him carrying the crate with the fibers inside
a peel of thunder ends and distant screaming is heard
margo stops appalled
did you hear that
dont stop now
up ahead they hear metallic rumbling and a crash
they round a corner and come up against a huge steel door
its one of the fire doors
good lord margo
pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac studying the blue prints by a stone wall
jonathan and the dog are with him exhausted and terrified
jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as pendergast works
i know where we are now
were getting out jonathan
this should be another door
taking a pen knife from his pocket pendergast places it into the plaster and gently twists the blade
a piece of plaster the size of a dinner plate falls revealing the tracings of another doorway
pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark dusty room
where the hell are we now
jonathan and pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door
pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens
all are stored in jars of alcohol
there are fetuses of many different species
we see a pig a cow a duck billed platypus as well as brain sections a disembodied monkey head
one rectangular glass container holds a skinned human foot
jesus what is this
another storage room
pendergast tries the light switch to no effect
the powers out
they cross the room to the main door and exit
now theyre in
pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks
the humming of the bugs can be heard in their cabinet
i know where we are
this is the osteo prep lab
i was in here earlier
were safe now
with these words the dog growls
jonathan freezes and sniffs the air
i smell it
keep the animal quiet
jonathan kneels by hobbes as pendergast listens every nerve on end
a sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage area
its unmistakable heavy breathing and the creeping movement of claws
pendergast lifts his gun
go out the other doorway
theres a stair at the end of the hall
up five flights is a corridor that leads to the hall of the heavens
find lieutenant dagosta
jonathan doesnt have to be told twice
he takes the dog and exits from the other side of the lab leaving pendergast alone
pendergast waits a moment until jonathans safely out of sight
he switches off his flashlight backs up slowly step by step
he opens the door to the alcoholics storage
as he slips inside a dark shape appears
slowly making no sound pendergast lifts the
anaconda passes his finger over the cylinder checking the loaded chambers
then he steadies the revolver and levels it at the door
the hideous pickled specimens seem to hover all around him
the smell is overwhelming and the snuffling is louder now
its coming closer
after a long moment there is a faint bump at the door
this is followed by a low scratching noise
pendergast watches frozen in horror holding his breath
the doorknob begins to turn
not knowing what else to do pendergast simply grabs it from the inside and holds on
outside he hears an amused snort then a low growl
theres one hard hit and the door shivers
the doorknob falls off
its over now
pendergast kneels down bracing the gun in both hands
from this position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell
his mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees
a huge red rimmed green eye
involuntarily pendergast leaps back nearly falls and drops the gun
beakers crash around him
he scrambles in the darkness
the flashlight falls and pops back on
the beam streaks up crazily
pendergast is an easy target now
he grabs for the light the gun steadies himself breathing fast and low
his heart pounds
but nothing more happens
the silence is heavy
the eye is gone
and suddenly pendergast understands
in the distance he can hear human voices and a rolling wheelchair
somewhere nearby are margo and frock
the monster has left him to get bigger game
fear for margo and frock lights pendergasts eyes
all panic and disorganization are gone
he holds his revolver at oclock and kicks the door open leaps out as a huge dark shape darts from the room
its headed for the secure storage areas again
pendergast takes off
not knowing how else to address this thing he finds himself calling
pendergast runs into the hallway but hes already too late
the hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed
as he levels his gun and shoots
stops rears back on its haunches looks once at pendergast pissed
as the voices around the far corner fall silent pendergast fires
the shot blasts off a piece of the wall
with astonishing speed and agility for its bulk the beast turns and leaps around the corner passing out of pendergasts sight
are margo and frock
frock holds the keys to secure storage area in his hand
margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers
they can hear the sound of thundering movement
margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast
its descending like a freight train
one split second of sheer amazement then
frock immobilized in his wheel chair stares at the monster like a trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk
margo grabs his keys from him fumbles desperately to open the door
it swings wide at last
she grabs the handles of the wheelchair tugs with all her might
the wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn thing inside
margo shoves frock behind her slams the door shut
seconds later the beast throws itself against the storage door
they hear it outside growling in fury claws lashing out
margo and frock press back in the darkness terror in their eyes
pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway his gun drawn his flashlight on
a few more steps and he holds hard
his eyes go wide in astonishment as his light illuminates the beast
its tearing at the steel door furiously with incredible force
as the flashlight beam hits it mbwun roars and looks up
now we see it clearly for the first time
the monster is massive putrid rank
slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red
a ridge of stiff black hair rises on the creatures buffalo like humped back
the withers are muscled and covered with plates
a forked tongue licks out as purple lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth
the claws raise up to fend off the light
pendergast steadies himself with difficulty takes a few seconds to aim with the greatest care
mbwun makes a move towards him and he squeezes the trigger hard
the gun echoes in the hall
a split second and a white streak moves right up the beasts cranium
a direct hit
the shot echoes and mbwun drops its claws
the flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the beasts eyes
angry and blinded the creature turns and in a moment lopes off
pendergast watches unimaginably relieved
realizing what just happened his knees start to buckle
he catches himself wipes one hand across his eyes
a voice comes from the storage room
are you all right
i think im hallucinating
the storage door opens slowly and margo looks out
where is it
shakes his head gone
a chromium alloy tipped
caliber bullet bounced off that things skull like a spit ball
i think it was bothered by my light
that would fit
as hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain
crying terrified unclear what exactly happened
these are the lucky ones
among them we find ippolito
his walkie talkie is squawking
the windows of the museum behind him are black
where the hell are you
were trapped in here
we need help
come in dammit
ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain knowing the extent of what hes done
the wheels are working hard now trying to figure out damage control
the walkie talkie keeps calling
he doesnt respond
tables are overturned food lies on the ground people cower in the darkness
dagosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie talkie
he shuts it off rises looks around
light comes from a few sputtering candles
most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered steel door
among them are kawakita and cuthbert
from the body of the man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood
bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door
manual overrides arent working
im getting nothing lieutenant
frank the father of the teenage girl lauren steps forward
theres no power
the whole systems down
the crowd starts to murmur
one man yells
and theres a killer in here
well get out safely if everyone stays calm
is anyone else hurt
the mayor stands
his wifes forehead is bleeding
is there a doctor
the distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward
check this woman and see if anyone else needs you
pound moves off
everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a dog bark
dagosta pulls his gun
the door to a stairwell at the far end of the room opens and hobbes bounds into the hall
hes followed by jonathan who is filthy and wild eyed
calls lieutenant dagosta
crossing breathless five flights down
we were lost in the sub basement
somethings down there
it killed our two deputies
when i left pendergast it was coming back
he sent me for help
we have to hurry
dagosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight
the remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear
in the center two men are bending over a still form
one of them is dr
both of you
get back here
but hes still alive get back now
the urgency in dagostas voice gets everyones attention
the mayor brings his wife over
cuthbert comes too
they huddle apart from the others
cuthberts white with fear
whats going on
dagosta speaks low
theres some kind of animal loose in the museum
he needs help
i want volunteers to go with me
swallows me too
voice rising in fear id do it gladly but someone needs to stay with these people
bailey get all the guns and flashlights give the mayor your walkie talkie so we can keep in touch
cuthbert keep everyone together and make sure they stay quiet
frank steps forward
i was in the marines
give me a gun
id go with you too but ive got my daughter
whats your name
you guard these people and your daughter
dagosta gives frank his service revolver
to dagosta where are you going
dont leave us alone
the remaining crowd begins to whimper
the mayor rises
the lieutenants in charge
bailey and dagosta carry shot guns
they quietly move to the back stairwell at the far end of the hall of the heavens
everyone else bunches together and watches
bailey well go first and check the stairwell
jonathan you and greg guard the door
jonathan gives hobbes leash to the mayor
dagosta hands greg kawakita a shotgun tightens his grip on his own
then he gives the signal and bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell
dagosta and bailey go in slowly
jonathan stays in the doorway sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight
kawakita gingerly holds his shotgun
hes scared out of his mind
he turns to jonathan whispers
could you tell me how this thing works
dont point it at me
just aim and shoot
dagosta heads down the stairs in the lead with bailey close behind
the stairwell is windowless and dark
dagosta shines his light and it cuts into the blackness
he moves quietly makes the first landing and stops
bailey watches his back from several steps behind as dagosta signals for him to wait
the flashlight flares into a glass door one flight down
dagosta raises his hand
low hold on
i thought i saw something
bailey pumps his shotgun
so does jonathan
kawakita fumbles to do like the others
dagosta moves alone down several more steps
the silence is heavy
suddenly dagosta wrinkles his nose
you smell that
at this something drops from above
a huge dark shape leaps into the stairwell descending two floors
it lands pounces on bailey and the marble walls echo with a roar
bailey screams in terror as mbwun pins him down
close on bailey
three claws close on his neck and wrench hard
theres a horrifying snap as baileys head comes off
blood spurts all over and drips down the stairs
dagosta levels his shotgun at the monster and fires with no apparent effect
when the shots stop echoing we hear screams and frantic barking from the hall
mbwuns green eyes look up and its forked tongue licks out
the monster leaps past baileys body and heads for the door
dagosta seeing whats happening screams at the top of his lungs
dont let it get into the hall
frozen in the doorway kawakita by his side
both of them are rigid with horror
disbelief in their eyes
the beast leaps up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door
dagosta keeps firing until hes pumping an empty chamber
plaster is falling all around
screams resound in the hall of the heavens as dagosta stumbles up the stairs
dagosta throws open the doors and charges into the hall
jonathan lies on the ground dazed
kawakita stands to one side teeth chattering in shock
his hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the gun swings in his hand
yells where is it
i dont know
it hit me hard
dagosta pumps two shells in the shotgun
screams can be heard from the people crouched together at the edge of the room
hobbes is barking wildly foaming at the mouth
its too dark to see whats happening
screams somebody tell me
where is it now
in the south corner
dagosta sweeps his light to the mayor who stands rigid in front of the others points to his left
the light moves to the far end of the room where the dark shape of mbwun crouches over the body of a man
its lunging up and down with odd jerking motions
the man is long past making a sound
from the monster comes a faint crunching and slobbering
jonathan rises comes to dagosta
so does frank
they stand shoulder to shoulder raise their guns
dagosta motions for kawakita
kawakita stumbles to join them tries to join in
the barrel of his shot gun still swings wildly
he steadies it by taking it in both hands
all three fire
theres a loud report
the kickback knocks kawakita backwards
screams erupt from the huddled group
hobbes abruptly shuts up
the men fire and fire until theres nothing left
dagosta reaches for more shells comes up empty
get everyone behind me
dagosta sweeps his light across the room but already the shape is gone
cuthbert hides behind the mayor calls out in a terrified squeal
it went out the door to the rotunda
dagosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors
theres a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam both doors
he picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles
the doors shudder as something hits them hard
get everyone into the stairwell
jonathan the mayor cuthbert and kawakita together herd everyone towards the stairwell
they move inside
dark and close
the smell of gunpowder and death
the mayors wife sees baileys body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up
get his gun and his walkie talkie jonathan
my office is on the third floor
theres a walk in safe and a portable phone
we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help
i have to help pendergast
kawakita and jonathan stay with me
the rest of you can go with cuthbert
i think we should stick together
taking baileys shotgun me too
whoever wants can come with me
no one follows
jonathan go with him
he isnt armed
jonathan grabs hobbes leash from the mayor and bounds up the stairs
everyone else follows dagosta
together they head down
police cars are pulling up outside the museum
torrents of rain limit the number of onlookers
crowds of people are scattered about
theres disbelief on everyones faces
many people are in shock
ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a guard station near the gate
he yanks the door open and jumps inside
a number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion
all right everyone
im in charge
one of the security men waters rises
swat teams are on the way
fire trucks with them
everythings slowed down because of the rain
were bringing in portable generators
theyll get the emergency lights working but they wont pump enough power to lift the doors
ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie
a string of curses followed by
where the hell are you
i made it outside
ill co ordinate the rescue efforts from here
help is on the way
just sit tight
its a little late you son of a bitch
theres a friggin monster loose in here
get the fbi the fire department
find metal cutters cut through
and bring a cannon
the damn thing is huge
a long moment as the men look at each other
did he say monster
dagostas group has reached a lower floor
here this stairwell ends
ahead stretches the hall of the asian peoples
dagosta put on the mayor
dagosta passes the walkie talkie to the mayor
mayor jordan here
this is ippolito head of museum security
relieve dagosta and take command
dont tell me what to do you chicken shit bastard
i saw you cut and run
lieutenant dagosta stayed with us
he is in charge
there is a monster
i saw it
cut through those doors and get us out of here now
the mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner and disappear from sight
ippolito finds waters and the others staring at him
humiliated he swallows hard
the steel doors are designed to retard cutting
we can go through them but it would take hours
the quickest way in would be to go through the roof sir
cell two goes up to the fifth floor
there are sky lights up there
co ordinate with the fire department and swat teams
its very dark
the huge shape of mbwun can barely be seen sliding out of the stairwell and into the hall of the asian peoples
then dim red hall lights come on in the corners of the ceiling
the monster utters a low growl
the emergency generators are beginning to come on
the animal lopes to the spot where we last saw dagosta and his group sniffs the ground
it looks up and with a curiously human gesture cocks its massive head
the silence is broken by voices
theyre in the distance and muffled but definitely there
the monster crouches eagerly lopes forward with great stealth
the voices are getting louder
we follow as it goes through the hall and down
at the bottom mbwun quickly turns a corner
the voices have stopped
mbwun creeps forward enters
a huge room several stories high
a whale hangs suspended from the ceiling
dioramas of fish line all the walls
mbwun pauses next to a diorama of the gentle vegetarian sea cow the manatee
the two make a startling contrast
a pause and then the voices are heard again much louder now
the source is right around the edge of the manatee display
mbwun leaps forward claws lashing out
he turns the corner and crashes through a wall of glass as he grabs at the source of the voices
a display of small extraordinarily life like talking holograms
theyve been re activated with the emergency power system
each little talking figure is no more then five inches high
they move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals explaining the lung systems of fish
stands in the pile of broken glass stares at the holograms mesmerized
he makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a chuckle
then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms
but the shadowy creatures cant be caught
the beast seems to realize this snorts and moves off
as he goes he passes behind a large glass elevator
it stands in middle the open room
the elevator is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story exhibit
in the dim light with his poor vision the monster doesnt see dagosta the mayor kawakita and their entire group sandwiched inside
the monster exits the exhibit and quietly dagosta slides the doors open
everyone all thirty five people in evening clothes quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the far side of the hall
margo frock and pendergast wait in the darkness
pendergast for the first time seems fazed
i dont know how to deal with this
like nothing i ever saw
im not trained to deal with a monster a supernatural creature like that
its not supernatural
mbwun is an animal
part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the half goat half sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam
but this isnt the jungle
this is new york
how did it get here
a thing like that crossed two continents
it makes no sense
lame we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate
i dont believe it
none of that matters now
the people upstairs need us
we have to help
weve managed to get inside the one place thats safe
i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements
if we go outside were risking more lives
you have to accept it margo theres nothing we can do
the building must be swarming with police by now
it wont take long for them to get through the doors
that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes
but what can we do
our guns are useless we have the fibers
dont you see
the creature is hungry
it wants the hormones in these plants
it would take hundreds of human brains to supply whats in these fibers
were just a poor substitute
to make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants
cuthbert enters with jonathan and the dog hobbes
cuthbert locks the door with shaking hands
he mutters to himself in terror
two inches thick
tell me theyll hold
cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a ruger
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring
wheres the walk in safe
whats the combination
ill do it
just let me find my portable phone
he rummages in the darkness going through his desk
i found it
cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on
cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe starts frantically turning the tumblers
jonathan follows with the dog
that thing wont come after us right
its going for bigger game
the group blundering around in the basement
just a minute
take the gun
cuthbert fumbles to hand over the ruger
as he does something drops
i dropped my rabbits foot
cuthbert drops to his knees groping in the darkness
for chrissake ill do it
whats the combination
to the left twice then five no
i think its fifteen
its been a while
jonathan starts again sweating
the tumblers fall with agonizing slowness
cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck charm
meanwhile unnoticed by jonathan the dog is staring at the oak doors
we see the hair on his back rise
eight to the right
i found it
clutching the rabbits foot like a talisman cuthbert leaps up just as the last tumbler falls
at this the oak doors behind them crash open splintering like so many match sticks
cuthbert screams in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast
the dog barks wildly at mbwun
jonathan lifts his shot gun
but the monster barrels past him and zeros in on cuthbert
a huge red tongue licks out and encircles cuthberts waist
it squeezes him horribly drags him towards the open jaws
cuthbert bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter
he opens his hand and the rabbits foot drops
the last jonathan sees of cuthbert is his head disappearing down mbwuns throat
hobbes barks and whines in terror
jonathan takes the leash and drags the animal out
jonathan and hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear
behind them comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls
the door opens slowly and pendergast appears
he shines his beam in both directions
margo and frock quickly come out
margo holds the crate
frock tries to follow in his wheelchair
im coming with you
youd slow us down and put margo in danger
unlock one of the other storage rooms
were going upstairs
well leave a trail back to and try to trap the monster in here
margo this is too dangerous
you always think you can solve everything
this time you dont have enough information
the animal might behave in unexpected ways
to pendergast leave her here with me
dont put her in danger
youll need me at this a loud sound comes from upstairs
no not footsteps
people running for their lives
all three know this ends the discussion
frock opens the door to room
inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks
margo takes pendergasts handkerchief and wraps her hand
she quickly sprinkles some of the fibers inside the door to room
frock disappears into room he looks back to margo one last time
come back and get me
remember it has poor eyesight
it hunts with its sense of smell
so for gods sake margo dont get those fibers on your clothes
margo and pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run for the far stairs
from somewhere above the sound of running is louder now
dagosta and his group enter the large domed space in disarray
theyre spread out and panicked the young helping the old
pound is finding it hard to keep up
frank and his daughter lauren bring him along
the mayor quietly urges people forward
his wifes face is streaked with tears
kawakita runs with dagosta
its still back there
now a voice is heard in the distance
where are you
dagosta shines his light into the large space
above them constellations glow
dagosta calls out
margo and pendergast run
margo carries the crate carefully wrapped in pendergasts jacket
that was dagosta
calls out vince
theres a double steel fire door at the end of the hallway
pendergast and margo run for it
pendergast shoves at the door
it wont budge
theres a small glass window
in it dagostas face appears
through the window pendergast
its right behind us
this doors locked
try shooting the hinges off
dagosta turns to his group
dagosta frank and kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot repeatedly
the shots echo wildly
the sound is terrifyingly loud
the small glass window shatters
then the men lean heavily on the door
it still wont budge
dagosta looks through the window
its no use
we have to get out of here
to kawakita give them your walkie talkie
kawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window
margo takes it
yes hes fine
take care of yourself
pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints
is there another way around
the planetarium is in the next cell
this is one of the fire doors
pendergast returns to the window
theres no way we can get to you with the fire doors down
theres an entrance to the sub basement in the hall off the north side exit
the sub basement
ive been down there
it links up to the old sewer system
i can guide you out
dagosta turns to the others
how much ammo do we have to make a stand
youre asking me
i dont even know how to load this thing
theres a movement of air
and a ripe fetid smell
dagosta pumps his shot gun
i smell it
go out the north exit
theres a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases
get behind me
the others move past
dagosta frank and greg kawakita hold the rear
the group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment disappears
pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously
from the south entrance to the planetarium an enormous dark shape slinks into view
pendergast steps back from the doorway turns to margo
what are you going to do
pendergast checks his gun totally calm
buy them some time
margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas
theres a plain door at their end of the hall
pendergast faces the broken window
the beast is slinking away after dagosta and the others headed to the north exit from the planetarium
pendergast calls out
hey you big tub of lard
the beast pauses turns
pendergast puts his palms up at his ears wiggles his fingers and makes a face through the window
come on you smelly pile of refuse
come get me
i dare you
a low surprised growl comes from the beast
it crouches as if to pounce
pendergast makes more faces sticks his tongue out
the beast watches in silence its evil eyes fixed
she cant leave him yet
what is it doing
loud its scared of me
suddenly theres a crash and the door bends like cardboard
two huge sets of claws lash through
margo screams as the claws pass inches from pendergasts face
he leaps back lifts his gun which looks like a pea shooter in the face of mbwun
two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door then mbwun simply lifts it out of the frame
this leaves pendergast face to face with the foul enormous monster
it regards him evenly blinks once
then the tongue slides out licks its lips eagerly and
pendergast flicks on his high powered flashlight shining it at close range right in the beasts eyes
then carefully with total calm he fires once twice
the beast howls more in anger than pain rears up and swipes at pendergast
pendergast dives to one side and the claws miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light
now pendergast spins and runs for all hes worth
margos been waiting holding the door
drop the fibers
she leaves the crate behind as pendergast dives inside with her
margo shoves the door shut hard as mbwun still blinded leaps into the hall
but now suddenly all is quiet
no sign of margo and pendergast
the beast moves forward snuffling slowly
it starts for the door which hides margo and pendergast but stops as it finds
the beast moves to it clearly surprised
it pokes at the crate carefully inhales the fragrance and grunts
the monster seems to be struggling with itself
it sniffs the fibers lifts a few out carefully then shoves the crate away hard
then it rises on its haunches and squints into the dark
on all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo gazelle wild horses wolves giant elk sabre tooth tigers
mbwun moves close to one after another
suddenly we notice in the back of one of the dioramas
margo and pendergast
they stand frozen crouching behind mannequins of native americans riding horses across the plains
the beast sniffs right at their window then turns away
confused it heads back towards the planetarium and slinks from the room
inside the diorama
pendergast and margo exchange an astonished look
its eyesight is worse than i thought
it couldnt see us
and it couldnt smell us through the glass
it didnt want the fibers
what does that mean
it means its full
then it wont go after the others
its still hunting but not for the hormones
for the pleasure of the kill
greg the mayor dagosta and the others are in a hallway lined with at least a dozen vases
a greek vase has been shoved aside revealing the outlines of a door
behind is a sloping dark corridor
the last of the thirty five people pack in
greg and dagosta cover the corridor
thats it lets go
grim faced dagosta follows kawakita as they duck through the doorway shutting it behind them
the impact rattles the wall and the greek vase falls
kawakita and dagosta reach the bottom and turn to see the mayor his wife dr
pound and their whole group standing in several feet of rushing water
lauren is shivering
her father has his arm around her tight
behind them are two corridors one forking left and the other straight
dagosta gets out the walkie talkie clicks it on
into walkie talkie pendergast
we made it
you all right
pendergast has the plans open as he studies them
he speaks into the walkie talkie
margo paces behind him thinking hard
take the left fork behind you
youll be in a straight passage
when the hall forks again in fifty yards go right
then radio back
dagosta shuts off his walkie talkie
everyones staring at him
kawakita cover the rear
hes not a good enough shot
ill do it if you take care of my daughter
frank expertly reloads
dagosta holsters the walkie talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage
kawakita takes charge of lauren who is confused and terrified
the tunnel has a slight downhill grade and the water begins to move faster tugging at everyones legs
people slip and slide as they half make their way down the hill
dagosta calls behind them
its getting deep
back not far from the first fork
he looks towards the head of the tunnel calls out
youll be the first to know
frank turns and plunges after the others
but then suddenly he stops
he reaches the second fork and takes a right
this tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper
slimy plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on
dagosta pulls out his walkie talkie
i made the right hand fork
were already in about three feet of water
where should we go
but before pendergast can answer dagosta hears the loud report of franks gun
everyone freezes in the darkness
the walkie talkie cackles and dagosta shouts
sweet jesus help
they hear splashing in the water
lauren screams tries to run back
kawakita grabs her
theres more thrashing water and then silence
are you all right
dagosta starts for frank but the mayor catches his arm and holds him
its too late
everyone waits staring into the darkness
still no answer
dagosta turns his flashlight on the water
its running red
he spins to the mayor points down the tunnel
people start to cry and whimper as the mayor urges them on
he takes charge of lauren
only greg kawakita stays with dagosta
they stand shoulder to shoulder and completely alone
thrashing in the water can be heard as the beast comes closer
theres a low pleasurable growl
both men lift their guns
behind them in the tunnel is total blackness
ahead is equally dark
the noise of their friends gets ever fainter
the water now rushes half way up their thighs
kawakitas teeth start to chatter
he bites them shut steadies his gun
silence as the water murmurs
dagosta holds the count
a long agonizing moment
kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel
i think its gone
suddenly a huge claw snakes out of the water right in front of them and the beast roars up
it was beneath the surface directly before them
the claw closes on dagosta and his shot gun goes off
dagosta screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth
for one horrible moment kawakita is frozen
then he leaps forward shoves the barrel of his gun behind dagosta right in the beasts open jaws
he pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes the recoil throwing him back ass over tea cups in the water
with a roar of pain the monster drops dagosta and retreats in the dark
dagosta grabs kawakita
i think you took its tonsils out
they haul ass down the tunnel firing behind them as they go
ahead is another fork
the group is waiting
when they see dagosta and kawakita a cheer goes up
as he runs up dagosta grabs for his walkie talkie
the holster is empty the walkie talkie gone
without missing a beat he registers whats happened then covers it up with the next breath
he points to the right as if theres no doubt and says
dagosta exchanges a look with kawakita who understands exactly what happened
as they plunge into the right tunnel greg mutters
pendergast and margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to the dioramas
pendergast holds the walkie talkie desperate
can you hear me
nothing but static comes in response
margo paces in agitation
we have to try and draw it off
the answers right in front of us
she points to one of the dioramas
it shows a bird being stalked by a fox
thats a ptarmigan feigning a broken wing
the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest
starts running its deceptively simple
like a bruckner symphony or a matisse
margo heads for the planetarium calling
they disappear down the hall with the greek vases both calling with all theyve got
there are increasing numbers of swat vehicles around
a helicopter lands on the roof
the rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain pouring down
ippolito is in the thick of the action
commander jennings comes over buckling an ammo belt over his fatigues
weve got enough firepower to turn a herd of lions into a fine red mist
then do it
jennings nods goes off
as ippolito watches the s
team break the glass skylights gets ready to go in
jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the hall of the reptiles
hobbes is still by his side
he keeps the gun pointed out into the room his eyes scanning the dark
he whispers to hobbes as if to comfort both of them
its okay hobbes
well be all right
help has got to come eventually
well make it
well be fine
suddenly he sees something
what appears to be a body lying on a glass case
jonathan pumps his gun approaches slowly
the man wears a tuxedo is lying very still
as we get closer we see its the drunk kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago
he suddenly hiccups
now the man gently snores
jonathan moves to him shakes the drunks shoulder
the man snorts opens his eyes and frowns
who the hell are you
jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case
the mans a little unsteady as he tugs at his tux
i got lost tryin to find the bathroom
i was walkin in circles
i lay down for a nap
whats going on
you wouldnt believe me if i told you
hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw jonathans attention
what is it boy
from above comes the beating of a distant helicopter and then the sound of breaking glass
hobbes pulls jonathan back to the staircase
jonathan grins follows behind with the drunk
where we going
i think were going home
huge skeletons of tyrannosaurus stegosaurus and brontosaurus loom in the darkness
rain is pouring in
jonathan hobbes and the drunk enter looks up to the sky lights
a flash of lighting hits illuminating the dinosaurs and a s
team which is descending on a series of ropes
its a sixty foot drop
jonathan steps forward
were over here
they run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend
the first one down is jennings
are you hurt
i dont know about the people downstairs
in the hall of the heavens
youll need help
theres a monster down there
a sling suspended on ropes is lowered down
the rescue workers will lift you out one at a time
jennings signals to a group of five men heavily armed and in flack jackets
they prepare to get the drunk out
pendergast and margo are at the top of the long narrow shaft
pendergasts flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black oily water below
both of them continue calling trying to draw off the monster
they suddenly hear the sound of splashing
an updraft rustles their clothes
margo sniffs the air turns to pendergast
you smell that
the group has reached another intersection of tunnels
the left fork turns back uphill
dagosta indicates this tunnel
at least well be dry
they all press forward in the low vaulted darkness
as they move steadily upwards the water recedes
kawakitas flashlight flickers and he bangs it
it comes on again
i believe in you a hundred percent vince but thats the second time weve been at that intersection
not so loud
dagosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in a large round pipe
all right everybody hold up
kawakita and dagosta move past the shivering people who are strung out along the sides of the tunnel
dagosta touches each person as he passes
we dont know whats in there
let me go first
the mayor follows behind with the group as kawakita and dagosta lead the way
the pipe is dry and rusted
they move forward with stealth
in twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness
dagosta steps out first
the group huddles at the mouth of the pipe confused as dagosta pans his flashlight around the huge space
the walls are carved out of dirt and rounded like a cave
from the ceiling hang huge cobwebs
theres a large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed
on a mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag
greg moves to it shines his light on the side
a name is written in marker
what does it say
looks up shocked dr
whats that doing here
i dont know
i thought dr
whittlesley died in south america
theres a ladder at the end
i think it goes up to the street
they move forward into the darkness eagerly towards the ladder which leads up to a manhole
but as they pass the bed of twigs something loud crunches underfoot
what is that
dagosta shines his light down and everyone freezes
then one woman the wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white bones
the humming noise is louder and we see its source
atop the bones is the body of cuthbert
its covered with black dermestid beetles
theyre stripping the skeleton clean devouring the flesh
the group panics and breaks for the ladder
kawakita and dagosta once more guard the rear
where are we lieutenant
id say were in its home
pendergast and margo run down the long dark room passing an enormous hollowed out canoe
as they exit the far end the dark shape of mbwun emerges
it leaps forward closing in fast
margo and pendergast enter a series of maze like room with hidden corners nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric buddhist and japanese art
theyre running through the twists and turns as fast as they can
were not going to make the storage room
listen to me pendergast
mbwuns dna is part homo sapien
in primates the eye is a direct path to the brain
if you get a clean shot theres only one place you can kill it
shoot it in the eye
at this they round a corner and mbwun leaps out
it circled ahead and was waiting in front of them
the animal swipes at margo and pendergast
the force of the monsters blow sends margo reeling and slams pendergast into the wall
he falls crumples and drops his gun
the case beside him shatters spewing relics as mbwun pushes past
pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty
margo is frantically crawling away in the dark
the beast makes a low sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw easily pins her down
pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon
on margo now pinned beneath the heaving body of the monster
powerless she looks up into the horrible face of death as mbwun raises an enormous claw
pendergast desperate cries out please no
dont hurt margo
oddly enough the beast pauses for once
talking to the damn thing is the one tactic no one has tried
the claw halts in mid air
the beast blinks once and looks from pendergast to margo
margo sees a flash of something unexpectedly human in its eyes
in astonishment she whispers
as they stare amazed imperceptibly the beast appears to narrow its eyes in response
margo controls her voice keeps it even
please let me go
we wont hurt you
a strange noise comes out of the monster
a low confused growl
he doesnt loosen his grip on margo but he leans down to look at her closer with one green unblinking eye
she struggles not to turn away in revulsion
his enormous jaws are right near her throat
everything is very still
a barrage of fire breaks out
team is in the doorway laying down everything theyve got
the creature roars as if betrayed leaves margo and leaps up
it barrels down on the s
team picks up jennings and spikes him to the ground
jennings hits the floor with his neck at a crazy angle
it snaps like a twig
the other men drop back
mbwun follows tearing through the men cutting a deathly swath
pendergast moves to help the s
margo struggles to her feet and her hand touches the wall
beside her is a fire hose in a cabinet
in a split second margo hauls it out throws a switch and gets a blast of water
she turns it on the beast as it grabs for pendergast
the force of the water is enormous
it pushes the monster out the end of the hall
pendergast runs towards her takes the hose and holds it
she takes off blindly in the maze like room
from somewhere behind her she hears a horrible howl
as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases tearing blindly in the dark
ahead is a door
she dives through it and finds shes in
a row of mirrors and urinals line the wall
its a huge room designed to handle crowds of visitors
margo ducks into one of the stalls as mbwun crashes in
margo looks through a crack in the door to see
the sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound
the claws lash out breaking every mirror in the place littering the floor with glass
then the beast turns and backs up groaning as if cornered
margo sees now that one limb is dragging leaving a trail of blood
the mouth too appears to be bleeding
teams bullets had an affect
margo presses back in the stall bracing as the beast gets closer
its just outside
it sniffs the air once and suddenly turns rears up furious and crashes through the bathroom door
margo screams and the thing grabs her
it holds margo up before it and roars
it closes its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for everything
the claws tighten
she struggles and fights to no purpose but then the beast pauses
its seen something
it stops and its grip loosens
a pained look flashes across its bestial face
and in that split moment margo looks down
gleams around the beasts throat too
the necklace is the twin to her own
can it be possible
she stares at the thing
you killed him
incredibly the beast shakes its head
a noise comes from it
a sad noise like a groan
and now margo gets it
she can hardly believe it
her eyes widen in astonishment
the name is a knife through the monsters heart
its not possible
the last piece of the puzzle falls
the monster is john whittlesley
margo still desperately frightened tries to keep control
if it is you
i can help
the monster shakes its head no and releases her
as she watches he moves away quickly limps out the door
mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet headed for the stairs
in the darkness of the hall of asian peoples pendergast is waiting
he lifts one of the s
team rifles which he holds in his hands
he aims is about to fire but then margo comes up behind him
dont kill him
pendergast you were right
that thing is john whittlesley
i should have seen it before
the fibers are infected with a virus
you eat them and the virus alters your dna
he became addicted to them in south america followed the plants back to the states
he probably entered the country as a man
it would have taken several months for the change to take place
thats how he got from the boat to the museum
pendergast looks over and sees the monster
his eyes show disbelief
mbwun looks back at both of them briefly then it disappears up the stairs
i dont believe it
you have to
all viruses pass on their own dna
instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses
this one was different
it inserted a whole array of genes into john
reptile genes sixty five million years old
those genes remade him
its not his fault
whatever that thing is we have to kill it
margo tries to stop him but he shrugs her off
a helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the roof
ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a sling
waters approaches holding the walkie talkie
we cant raise the s
no ones answering
what do you want to do
ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them
pull him up
lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons all around as mbwun limps into the hall
the men on the roof stare down astonished
their mouths hang open at the sight
get more guns
the men get the drunk up and abandon the sling leaving jonathan trapped below
jonathan and hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide
mbwun sees jonathan lifts both claws swings at the skeleton sending it crashing down
jonathan screams hobbes is caught and falls
he scrambles into a corner whimpering as pendergast and margo appear in the door
fifteen more s
team members with rifles now line the hole in the roof
they all point their guns at mbwun
were going to shoot
now margo runs forward
let me talk to him first
screaming kill that thing
kill it now
turns and sees margo
she speaks desperately
you can give up now
just lie down where you are
mbwun seems to consider for a moment but then its eyes gleam and it roars
with renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to walk up it like a gecko on all fours
on the roof
some of the s
team fall back in terror
now that the monster is on the wall its out of range of their fire
holy shit its coming this way
its headed for the roof
ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror
astonished waters tries to regain control
get back here you asshole
we cant let it get out
to the s
team surround the opening and kill it
but the men are terrified retreating like ippolito
thats an order
but the team is in chaos and losing precious time
the monster is now half way up the wall
margo is distraught crying
her cool demeanor is cracked
pendergast is with her
she shakes her head
just like john
he wont listen
i have to shoot
do it quickly
aim for the eye
pendergast raises a high powered rifle with a laser sight
he aims the red laser beam directly at mbwuns left eye
he has to look here or i wont get a clear shot
call him margo
you have to
do it now
margo takes a moment her eyes streaming
she has no choice she calls out
john look at me
the beast looks down sees pendergasts rifle
theres a long awful moment
suddenly it emits a sound like a wail
shes crying as she raises her arm as if to say good bye
and the gun explodes
its head shoots back in pain and it falls
sixty feet straight down to the ground
pendergast turns to margo and quietly folds her in his arms
there are cops and journalists ambulances and medivacs all over the place
greg kawakita wet and bedraggled as a rat runs up from columbus ave
behind him the mayor and dagosta help the rest of the company to the ambulances
waters is on the steps of the museum helping to organize the rescue efforts as kawakita runs up to pendergast
have you seen her
shes over here
greg turns to see margo come out of the rotunda with frock jonathan and hobbes
her face is devastated
he moves to her side
she reacts as she sees him and teacher and pupil hug
dagosta is lost in the swirl of people
and he likes it like that
he rests against a large stone lion pulls out a cheap cigar in cellophane unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet match
hes struggling hopelessly
finally he tosses the useless pack of matches sighs
but then a flame lowers right before his face
he looks up to see pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter
dagosta smiles takes a nice long hit
nice to see you lieutenant
the sub basement huh
we go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back
christmas decorations are up
a light snow is falling
there is a very long line
all the registers are doing a booming business
people are buying mbwun posters t shirts and hats
school tours old ladies parents and children foreign tourists with cameras snake through the displays
in the room with the relic theres a tremendous crowd
margo closes her computer looks out a window at the falling snow
she turns and walks into the back office
kawakita is working there alone
his fly fishing rod stands in the corner untouched
margo goes to it smiles softly
no time for fishing anymore
greg looks up from his work and smiles
got to finish this thesis sometime
how about lunch
besides i think the director of the museum is expecting you
greg returns to his work
margo heads down the hall to the directors office
she walks through the new double oak doors to find dr
frock seated at cuthberts old desk
look whos here margo
pendergast and dagosta rise out of two high backed chairs
margo smiles for the first time takes pendergasts hands
im so glad to see you
whats the occasion
im in town on a case
dropped by to see vince and we thought wed see the new display
margo pendergast and dagosta follow frock past the familiar dioramas
frock i was wondering
what happened to the rest of whittlesleys plants
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta
shouldnt a drug that powerful be destroyed
the virus itself might have positive applications
theyll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made
beat greg isnt joining us
hes always working on his thesis
he comes in early stays late
i tried to get him to join us but he never takes a break
they pause on a new diorama
its huge filling one entire end of the hall
in the center is a life sized representation of mbwun standing on the tepui amid the plants
behind is a painting of john whittlesley as he once was
he wears the necklace with the two arrows of silver and gold
as margo looks she touches her own
pendergast turns to her sympathy in his eyes
we did the right thing margo
margo smiles warmly
greg kawakita wears gloves high powered glasses works in solitude in the lab
suddenly he stands up throws off the glasses then he sits down again
he seems to be struggling with himself
he glances over his shoulder to make sure hes alone
quickly he moves to a locked drawer
he opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small envelope looks inside
the envelope is full of the plant fibers
greg has managed to keep his own cache
moving quickly with jerky motions he lays one fiber down on a slide with a shaking hand
with an exacto knife he cuts off a tiny sliver pops it into his mouth
he closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the taste
then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver leaves it on the slide
he takes a deep breath returns the envelope to the drawer
he turns the key carefully and we go close on his hand
on the back is a row of scales
