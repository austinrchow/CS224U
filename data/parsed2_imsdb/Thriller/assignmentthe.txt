shabtai we open with the screen filled with a dark gray cut down the middle by a black crevice
we should be unsure of what we are looking at
is it the surface of the moon or some primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash
just then a liquid with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice and further divides the screen in two like a river border dividing east from west
camera pulls back and up to reveal that the dark gray gulch filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a parisian street and the yellowish river that
ran down the middle of the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little boys who are peeing on the pavement laughing at their mischief
the boys are twins
they wear backpacks and are set to go off to school
just then we hear the voice of a woman shouting in french with english subtitles
what do you think youre going
you ought to be ashamed behaving like that
camera pulls back and up to reveal ever more scenes of life on this particular street
the woman shouts at the children from her window and the children run off
at the corner fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe as chairs are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are preparing for their morning clientele
camera pulls back and up to reveal a taxi driver arguing with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and set off for work as we continue
pulling back and across the city over montmartre picking up an argument between two drivers here fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over there
chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the city awakens and we float across montmartre into a small residential quarter
husbands kiss wives who send school children on their way as titles continue and the city comes more and more to life and we hover across a small square just
up from the place de la opera not far from the boulevard saint germain des pres with montmartre in the b
the square has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel whose shuttered windows overlook the square
as we pull back and back over the small square we literally
pull backwards through the slats of the shutter going from an aerial shot being sucked in through the semi closed shutters into a hotel room where we continue ever so
slowly pulling back
the first thing we see in this shot which should appear seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the preceding scene is a spider web
we are tight on the web in which a still living insect struggles against his silky bonds
the web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim soon to be lunch
as the spider makes this journey we become aware in the b
of the panting sounds of lovemaking
it is a womans breathless sighs and gasps we hear but under that perhaps a mans voice perhaps not
the sounds build to a climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers the glistening body of a beautiful young parisian woman in post coital dewy nirvana
then the figure of a nude man in silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered window
his face and body are half lit by the slats of light that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room
he lights a cigarette
whom we will come to know as carlos
he lights the cigarette and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his lungs glancing out at the street and alternately at the spider who tiptoes down to
he watches the spider envelop the still living victim with her spindly legs
then he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows bright a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to the spiders body
whispering to the burnt spider you lose
he looks out through the shutters at the digital clock across the square
then he glances back at the girl whom we will call colette
the conversation is in french with english subtitles
what do you mean
i mean get out
youre a pig you know that
how can you be like that
carlos crosses to her slowly
he runs his hand across her cheek then down across her throat
death is in his eyes
barely above a whisper leave without saying another word
carlos stands in front of the mirror
the mirror is cracked and in it we see the fractured face of carlos staring back at us from opposite sides of the cracked glass
he wears surgical gloves
from a make up kit by the side of the sink he removes a piece of false hair and spirit gum as titles a
carlos affixes a john lennon mustache
carlos puts on a brown wig of moderately longish hair such as one might have seen on a student in paris in the early seventies
carlos puts on a pair of john lennon granny glasses and the student look is complete
carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket
he now looks every inch the young french student dressing down to look like one of the proletariat
carlos takes an m hand grenade and puts it into an inside pocket of his coat
he puts a machine pistol and snaps its ammo clip into it and puts it in his students shoulder bag and then takes a walther ppk and places it in
his jeans at the small of his back
all the while that he is doing these things he sings all you need is love
singing all you need is love
rum da da da da all you need is love rum da da da da all you need is lo ve love is all you need
love is all you need
superimposed paris september
its a hot sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a cafe in st
germain des pres is bustling with young clientele
inside the cafe there is a second floor with a balustrade overlooking the tables inside
outside there are tables set up on the sidewalk
jack shaw a tall husky american in his late thirties sits at one of the front tables outside
he reads the international herald tribune
the headline is terrorists seize embassy issue demands and threaten attacks
jack sips his espresso
dressed as in preceding scene
just then jack looks up and sees him
for an instant carlos looks at jack tenses just slightly
jack looks back at his paper paying no attention
carlos pulls out a cigarette pats his pockets for a light
then he crosses to jack
he mimes flicking a match and jack looks for a match
he offers the lit end of his cigarette
carlos cups jacks hand
he crosses away from jack smiling and goes inside the cafe
jack follows him absentmindedly tracking his progress through the windows though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street
carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as jack sees the double image of carlos and the reflected street scene
carlos leans over pulls the pin from an m grenade and lets the spoon come off in his hand
we hear the timing fuse hiss as carlos nonchalantly counts to himself
counting one thousand one
one thousand two
one thousand three
he looks up just in time to see carlos drop the grenade casually into the crowd below
their eyes lock for a beat then carlos smiles turns and bounds away
jacks eyes widen in horror
he gets up about to cry out a warning
the crowd below as the grenade explodes filling the air with smoke and flying glass its metal ripping through flesh and bone
people are wounded bloody and writhing in pain and screaming in panic
disheveled covered with the shattered glass of the window but not but not seriously hurt he struggles to his feet
he looks around for carlos who has vanished now realizing who he was
as he looks around he sees a small boy staring at his left arm with heart rending disbelief
the boy has no hand
there are throngs of ambulances police and military personnel wounded survivors are being tended to
all is confusion and off in a corner we see jack standing with a man in a suit
the mans name is du foltiere
he shows jack an i
du foltiere monsieur intelligence liaison officer
my understanding is that you are the deputy chief of station cia paris and that you witnessed by coincidence this attack
and you have told my subordinate that you recognized the terrorist as carlos
du foltiere pulls out a small notebook to take notes
thats not what i told him
i said he recognized me
afterwards i realized who he was
by then it was too late
writing in his notebook ah yes
the deputy chief of station did not recognize him
but he recognized you
i wasnt the one wearing the disguise
yes of course
but then how are you sure it was him
how often do you see someone holding a live grenade listening to the fuse
besides the arrogant son of a bitch bastard smiled at me
superimposed vienna december its a cold sunday morning with a light snow just beginning to fall when six young men and one woman enter the headquarters of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries a modern seven story block of concrete and glass
they all carry adidas sport bags over their shoulders
their leader carlos with dark beret and sunglasses sports a long white raincoat the kind that was very much in fashion that winter
next to him is koj a japanese terrorist and his most trusted lieutenant
singing i shot the sheriff
but i did not shoot the deputy
at a long oval table twelve oil ministers
miniature national flags in chromium holders in front of them
behind sitting or standing the secretaries advisers interpreters and obviously some of the members are exploiting the oil price differentials as a loophole
this body has been very precise in its policy
the group with the adidas sport bags approaches the reception desk
carlos moustache sideburns and wispy beard in reddish brown smiles politely at the female receptionist
behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the railing at the top of the landing
there is what appears to be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece and tell tale bulge under his jacket
in german pardon me
is the conference still in progress
smiling back the ash blonde receptionist nods
in german yes but sir
in german i have an urdent delivery for the ministers
as if on urgent business carlos quickly heads up the flight of stairs before the security man who stands next to the receptionist can react
the security man speaks quickly into his walkie talkie
by the elevator at the top of the stairs
carlos bounds up the stairs and pushes the elevator button
the security man near the elevator listens intently to what is being said in his earpiece and he steps forward to challenge carlos
carlos smiles at him and whips out a mm
silenced beretta and fires two shots right between the security mans eyes
he falls over the railing and lands face up on the console in front of the terrified receptionist
carlos leans over the rail in one move and fires two shots into the upturned face of the security man who stands next to the shocked receptionist
the receptionist screams
angry i protest the unfound charges of the oil minister from venezuela
we do not use nor intend to use the lower gradings to capture more of the market his words are cut short when the door is kicked open and carlos
brandishing his automatic everyone frantically hits the floor
that is with the exception of two bodyguards
they try for their weapons
a short burst from carlos beretta machine pistol which is pulled from the inside of his trenchcoat brings them to the floor
this weapon is not silenced but deafening
just then koj enters the room from the corridor
weve got company
suddenly theres the sound of intense gunfire coming from the corridor
he reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a pocket sized chinese rgd grenade
he yanks the pin lets the spoon fly listens to the fuse hiss counts quite calmly and then tosses the live grenade to koj who catches it and in one
movement tosses it out the door
a loud sound of grenade explosion and plaster powders those glued to the floor
gasps of terror
but the gunfire outside ceases
my name is carlos
youll do as i say
his smile is cunning mocking and
we see an air france jet liner touch down on the runway
jack comes down the steps of the just landed jet
the blizzard whips around his face as he walks down the stair unit and onto the tarmac pulling his overcoat up around him
behind the desk is carl mickens the cia station chief tall angular cropped grey hair
he is in mid conversation with jack shaw who sits opposite him his overcoat over the arm of the chair in which he sits
he has obviously just come from the airport
twenty million dollars ransom
whos asking for it
the arm of the arab revolution
alias of the month time
shrugs could be anybody
the point is
their leader claims to be carlos
he does does he
he wants to make sure everyone knows its him
he wants the credit and the austrians want a positive id
thats when your name came up
who brought my name up
the guy who says hes carlos
the austrians want you there to identify him
at the airport
when they provide the plane to fly him and the hostages to libya
carlos evidently feels very comfortable in libya
they got him here in their own backyard and theyre gonna let him walk away
theyve got no choice jack
let em handle it like the israelis would
theyre not the israelis jack
its not their fight
then let me take him out
they want me to meet him at the airport
i can get close enough to get a clear shot at him
we can end this shit now
hes got seventy hostages
fuck the hostages
mickens looks at him almost in horror
jack knows he has let down too much of the mask of professionalism as it were
apologetically harold we can handle it with a minimum loss of life
we will handle it with no loss of life
those arent just any hostages
they are the oil ministers of the richest countries in the world and that twenty million bucks theyre gonna have to pay isnt gonna break em you know
its nothing to them
they just want to pay it and
its not our fight
what do you think carlos is gonna do with that money
put it in mutual funds
hell use it to hit us
let me assemble a team and we can
jack goddamnit there isnt any team to assemble
youre a fuckin dinosaur
were out of the assassination business
all of us
you got a personal hard on against this guy because he made you look like an asshole and now hes gonna rub your nose in it
i can appreciate your feelings but its not going down on our soil
it is not with our nationals and it is not our fight
now i got my orders and you just got yours
carl jack and various other cia functionaries walk quickly down the corridor with austrian police and intelligence officers
jack carries a briefcase as do they all
i gotta hit the john
jack stands inside of a stall in the mens room
he has just crossed a certain frontier in his mind and stepped in to the area known as no mans land
he quickly takes off his overcoat and jacket and we see attached to his arm a harness made up of straps and springs
he opens his briefcase and attaches to the harness a
he fumbles with the adjustments racing against time
finally he seems to have adjusted everything just so
then he lowers his arm to his side
then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands and the harness slams the
caliber beretta from his forearm straight into his palm
he resets the gun back into the forearm position
he has a look of grim determination on his face
the only question is is it the look of someone who is crazy enough to do what he is contemplating
on the tarmac an austrian airways dc
tv cameras lights generators are set up in front of the plane sending beams and pools of yellow light into the darkness and the snow which swirls all around as
a pool of reporters stands ready to record whatever is about to go down
among a small group of officials is jack shaw
everyones eyes are on an approaching yellow curtained bus
as it gets closer we can detect through its windshield a white raincoat and a black beret
carlos is standing by the driver with a machine pistol in one hand and a grenade in the other
his eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist his arm down at his side
as the bus parks by the dc carlos jumps out and waves to the media
not the customary v sign but the wave of a celebrity
the hostages then under their captors guns file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane
a line of exhausted bleary eyed middle aged men in expensive suits and in need of a shave
carlos however is as fresh alert and energetic as the morning of the attack
and hes definitely savoring the moment
tense he tries to be inconspicuous as he leans towards mickens
whispering i think its him but i cant be sure
not with those dark glasses and the beard
everyone on board he too climbs the mobile steps and disappears into the plane
suddenly he reemerges and comes down to where the officials and jack stand
as jack watches him intently he faces the minister of the interior
in the window of the plane we see koj holding a grenade to the pilots head
minister of the interior i presume
the distinguished looking man who looks a bit like kurt waldheim nods
im sorry this had to happen in austria
we have no quarrel with your government
his eye catching jack he stops in mid sentence
a devilish smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him
he pulls a cigarette out and crosses right over to jack up close and as they say very personal
the snowflakes whirl surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face
he mimes flicking a match
he takes off his glasses and looks at jack and smiles
we were never really properly introduced mister shaw
my name is carlos
with a cunning mocking smile he extends his hand out to shake jacks
jack stares at him ever so slowly beginning to raise his hand
with that move he knows the gun will come slapping into his palm and he will be able to take carlos out no matter what the cost
smiling eat shit and die slow
his hand starts rising
in another second the gun will spring into it
just then we hear jack no
jack turns to look at mickens
mickens indicates the photographers
you dont want your picture taken shaking his hand
jack is momentarily confused
he has turned to mickens thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the moment for the shot has passed
he turns back to carlos who shrugs and steps over to the austrian minister so that the minister now is between jack and carlos and the shot is lost
to the minister as i was saying im sorry about the loss of life
and thank you for your cooperation
once again he sticks out his hand
only this time as the cameras roll austrias minister of the interior shakes the hand of the archterrorist in what will go down in history as the handshake of shame
his eyes tell it all
we begin with an establishing shot of al aksa mosque and the mosque of omar in jerusalem
these are the two most famous landmarks in jerusalems old city skyline
camera then pans and tilts down and we are above the western wall looking down on the bobbing black hats of hassidic jews the knitted skullcaps of more modern orthodox
here and there the olive shirt of army uniform with m or galil assault rifle that sways in prayer as well
to the jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the square in front of the wall as we glide across the intersecting lines of paving stones set one next to
the other until a glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which crushes it out
there should be something in this sequence that is reminiscent of our opening a foreboding that just as the cracks in the parisian paving stones led us to carlos once
before perhaps these new stones will lead us once again to some act of terror
to reveal a man standing in silhouette the man who has just crushed out the cigarette
we cannot see his face because he has a camera to his eye
through the lens of the camera just established we see an old rabbi praying at the wall
the shutter captures the shot
the man in silhouette now lowers the camera and we see that he is carlos
there is no mistake even though the nose perhaps is a little different and this time he is clean shaven it is still carlos the jackals
he smiles slightly
busy photographing it carlos doesnt seem to notice the two arabs who watch him surreptitiously
he walks in front of soldiers who laugh and look at us pov carlos
carlos reaches into his pocket
is he perhaps going for a grenade to toss at these soldiers
we build tension as he pulls out instead another roll of film and with great determination we have the click of the door of the camera to enhance our music
beat as tension builds
surely it cant be long till carlos does something awful
carlos walks towards the suq working his way through the crown from the damascus gate as we reveal more soldiers in the foreground surveilling the area
from the pov of the two arabs following him we see carlos lost or pretending to be as he ambles along through the suq past all sorts of vendors hawking
heads of fish are cut off with the swift slash of a knife in one stall freshly skinned lambs hang by their feet in another
carlos still looking lost approaches a street vendor hawking rosary beads
we see them talk but cannot hear their dialogue
carlos walks on
a group of children play an impromptu game of soccer
we watch these innocent children playing
if this was a gun sight theyd be dead
it is carlos who has taken the picture
his smile at the sight of the children is no longer a subtle one
there is some secret enjoyment here
its then that he notices the two arabs tailing him
now what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways
carlos takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or two and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley
he is either trying to shake the two arabs or he has just entered every tourists nightmare a deserted alley in a foreign country with two bad guys
he quickens his pace
the arabs do too
carlos now knows theyre after him and he takes off running
so do the two arabs
only now there are three more arabs coming after him
a tense desperate chase in the moslem quarters labyrinth of twisted alleys and narrow streets
when his arab pursuers lose sight of him briefly carlos takes something out of his pocket some sort of id and throws it in an alleyway
carlos races through the suq past a group of arabs who begin heeding the call to prayer
they roll out prayer mats and begin acclaiming in arabic that there is only one god and mohammed is his prophet
carlos grabs one of the canvas awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe
he rips it off trying to make an obstacle course between him and his pursuers
he overturns trays of olives sacks of sunflower seeds anything he can get his hands on
carlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is hanging on display
he is disoriented terrified and then seemingly from out of nowhere he is tackled grabbed by the arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores
carlos is overcome and brought down to the ground
one of the arabs evidently has a deep dislike for carlos and though carlos is subdued he kicks the shit out of him
this room is your worst nightmare in the middle east
it could be a cellar suite in beirut or an interrogation cell in damascus
there is no way of knowing
it is simply an empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor to which carlos is shackled
battered and badly bruised hes obviously in great pain
the rooms metal door screeches as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call amos enters
with him are two of the arabs weve seen earlier
theyre bareheaded now without their kaffiyehs
accented english how do you feel
broken english i do not speak english
in spanish yo soy cubano
you spoke english well enough to your contact
the street vendor
so please lets not play games
were both professionals carlos
with heavy cuban accent my name
yes i know what your name is
alias carlos sanchez alias carlos martinez alias the jackal
with heavy cuban accent joure loco man
i am tourist
amos swoops down and with one hand pulls carlos by the hair over across his knee with his throat up and other hand in a hammer lock
amos brings his face down to carlos
listen to me you piece of shit
im trying very hard to be professional about this but you are in israeli hands now
so dont play games with me
carlos whose neck is stretched back like a goose about to be slaughtered can barely croak out an answer
amos loosens his grasp and straightens up
carlos winces in pain from broken ribs
as he speaks it is now unaccented english just the slightest trace of spanish background
youre telling me youre israelis
relieved im in some kind of an israeli prison
is that what youre telling me
amazing how much your english has improved in just a few seconds
trying to be very reasonable look obviously there has been some kind of mistake
i dont know who you think i am but i am a lieutenant commander in the united states navy okay
i am lieutenant commander annibal ramirez of the u
yorktown sixth fleet docked in haifa
i am not carlos or sanchez or illich or the jackal or whoever you think you just caught
if you call the u
embassy and ask for the sixth fleet liaison officer hell confirm everything ive said
he is not pushy just firm and decisive
the chutzpa of it is unbelievable
my hat is off to you carlos
carlos who from now on out will be referred to by his real name ramirez has had it with the reasoned approach
he now adopts the demeanor of a u
naval officer reaming an enlisted man a brand new bunghole
your hats off
ill tear your head off
you get on the horn and you call the u
embassy and you call the sixth fleet liaison office and then motherfucker you go out and find yourself a good lawyer and ill tell you somethin jack im gonna sue
your ass so bad that your great great grandchildren will still be shovelin shit to pay off the debt
amos is doing his best to look unflappable
give me a break huh
if you were an american officer you would have
id papers dog tags
i ditched em in an alley just before you guys got me
go back there youll find em
you ditched them
an american officer on shore leave in the middle east must travel in mufti civilian clothes
a bunch of arabs start chasing me
could be terrorism
could be kidnapping
instructions are to ditch our tags our id or anything else that could identify us
thats why i spoke spanish thats why i said i was a cuban not an american
and you broke my ribs here asshole
im gonna sue you im gonna sue your government
im gonna sue every fuckin jew i can get my hands on you understand me
amos walks down the corridor
for the first time he looks the tiniest bit concerned
shouting after him im gonna sue menachem begin im gonna sue moshe dayan im gonna sue the goddamned bnai brith or whatever you call it
amos sits in his office looking very worried
a long haired baby faced agent comes in
he could pass for a typical student traveling on holiday
his name is yoni
i want you to go back to the old city
where we caught
i want you to be very inconspicuous
take a half dozen men
you comb every alleyway there
every garbage can
everything you can find
for what looks like a u
military id if there is such a thing there
whats the problem
who said there was a problem
theres no problem
i just asked you to do something and youre going to do it
so theres no problem
yoni and half a dozen plainclothed shin bet agents walk through the alley looking around
yoni is dressed like a long haired backpacking student others dressed like arabs others like tourists
as inconspicuously as possible they search alleys and trash cans like the homeless searching for food
amos sits at his desk
just then yoni walks in
amos looks up
yoni puts a u
navy id complete with photo and a set of military dog tags on amos desk
it identifies its bearer as lt
commander annibal ramirez u
there is a picture of ramirez in the upper corner of the id in uniform
he holds the id and then sits back in his chair defeated and lets out a very jewish sigh
this is a high tech ultra modern chrome and glass room which features a map of the world etched in plexiglass with terrorist hot spots marked prominently
on the glass as well is the logo of the cia
in this situation room we find winston scott iii a year old pin striped suiter who appears to be amused
with him is monroe his black deputy and jack
in front of jack spread out on the desk is a file on ramirez
we see it as jack does
notes on the interrogation polaroid photos of ramirez in custory and the developed pictures from the roll of film which ramirez was taking in jerusalem
jack listens to scott and monroe but as he does he is taking in all the information in ramirezs file making no judgments just taking in information
i love it
those cocky israeli bastards thought they hit the jackpot
got the jackal right in their own backyard
state departments goin apeshit
and the navy
admiral trost was so pissed he was ready to shell the port of haifa
jack however isnt sniggering
hes thinking hard as he looks at all the information on the desk
youre not gettin it are ya
these werent some yokels
this was the israeli general security service
the best in the business
they have the most complete dossier there is on carlos the latest pictures of him
i mean whats that tell you
that they really ate it this time
doesnt it hurt to walk around like that with your head up your ass
i mean isnt it painful
his eyes glance down to the pictures especially the photos of the children
something begins to click
almost nothing is as cute as foot inch year olds struggling to play the most elementary form of baseball t ball
he is the first baseman and he is intent upon the batter who stands at the t
cheering their kids on
amongst them we recognize maura annibal ramirezs wife who is cheering for her sons team
she holds a ten month old baby as she cheers
on annibal ramirez resplendent in his summer whites his face still showing the faintest remnants of bruises at the hands of the israelis
he holds his sea bag in his hand
there is a waiting taxi behind him as he strides over towards the baseball diamond
he sees his father just as the batter hits the ball
the pitcher scoops the grounder up and tosses it to joey whose eyes however have lit up at the sight of his sailor father home from the sea so the
ball hits him in the side of the head and he goes down
ramirez wants to rush out to his son but joey straightens himself up quickly not wanting to be embarrassed by an over protective parent
maura has followed her sons gaze at ramirez and feels no embarrassment whatsoever as she runs into his arms still holding her baby
she kisses him
i thought you werent coming back till tomorrow
i wanted to be here for his game
look how beautiful she is
he picks up the baby and kisses her
just like her mother
what happened to your eye
it doesnt matter
its a stucco single level structure in a clean middle income neighborhood
jack shaw pulls up crosses out of his car and knocks on the door
the door opens revealing ramirez in a t shirt and pair of sweats
jack looks at his face the unmistakable face of carlos
joey watch yolanda
i beg your pardon
lieutenant commander ramirez my name is jack shaw
im with the government
id like to talk to you about what happened in israel
the barbeques coals which burst into flame as fluid and then match are applied
over this we hear i want to sue them okay
i want to sue the guy who broke my ribs
i want to sue their government and their mossad
and i want to sue golda meir
they stand at the barbeque as joey plays shooting hoops
ramirez holds yolanda
ramirez and jack speak quietly
meir is dead lieutenant commander
then you might want to have them dig her up because i intend to sue her
commander ramirez when i said i was from the government perhaps i should have been more specific
im from the cia
jack reaches down opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album like briefing book
he opens it up and hands it to ramirez
on the first page there is an enlargement of a photo of carlos entering a building
it is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like ramirez
does the man in that picture look familiar
ramirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that jack had when he saw ramirez for the first time
thats not me
i mean i know it looks like me
i know its not you
this carlos guy
just then joey yells from the tree hes in
jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency
poppi you dont need to watch the fire come climb with me
get out of that tree joey
your mother sees that and im dead
now when jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones
this is the only recent shot we have of him
telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the israelis
can you blame em for what happened
the only difference is the eyes
ramirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance
okay i get it now youre here to talk me out of my lawsuit
but see i identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after i told em who i was so
lieutenant commander i am not here about your lawsuit
carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world
hes personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history
men women children
children like yours
blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood
why did you join the navy
as if by rote to serve my country
to serve your country
to protect her from her enemies
well carlos is one of her enemies now
and hell probably become a bigger one
unfortunately is a growth industry
why are you telling me all this
lieutenant commander the governments of most countries in the free world have been after carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it
there is exactly one person in the world who can help us get carlos
and that person is you
what do you mean
to get him
all i can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation
it will involve a high degree of risk
that much said you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself
but if we succeed carlos wont be a threat to anyone anymore
now i know youre going to need some time to think about it so
no i dont need any time
the answers no
i am a naval officer
thats what i was trained for
thats what im good at
see you came to the wrong address
you want james bond
he lives in london and hes got an aston martin
you cant miss him
we hold on ramirezs look and jacks half smile
the officers club is decked out for a reception for admiral crawford
all the officers are in dress whites and all the wives wear white gloves and cocktail dresses as a navy string quartet plays softly in b
there is a reception line and the admiral stands with his aide who introduces each of the guests who pass through the line
admiral crawford this is commander and mrs
i know your family well commander i was with your father at the academy
i expect great things from you ward
i wont let you down sir
next up are ramirez and his wife maura
admiral crawford this is lieutenant commander and mrs
smiling its annibal sir
im glad to see were getting some mexican american officers in the ranks
im an l
boy myself so i have a real soft spot for authentic mexican food
my stomach doesnt always go along with it but
wed love to have you over to dinner admiral but the cuisine would be cuban not mexican
i think your stomach would find it more agreeable
not to mention your taste buds
youre cuban americans
oh im sorry
you grow up in l
and you hear ramirez and
anyway it was a pleasure meeting you
he looks uncomfortably over to his aide who gently keeps the line moving
camera follows annibal and maura down the reception line
there in front of them is jack in a white linen suit
we do keep bumping into each other dont we
how do you do mrs
i was over at your lovely home the other day but i felt cheated because i had to leave before i had the pleasure of meeting you
the pleasure is mine
para servirle yo soy encantado de conocerte
my wife speaks english mister shaw
so do i
perdonname i didnt think youd be embarrassed to speak spanish in front of the admiral
a sus ordenes
the bar ramirez stands at the bar
to bartender ill have a club soda and
a glass of white wine please
jack steps up behind him
jack holds a small wrapped package
let me guess the white wine is for your wife right
cause youre afraid to drink anything stronger than club soda around the brass
how do you stand this shit annibal
i mean theyre all so fuckin constipated
my wife is waiting for her wine
if youll excuse me
jack stands in front of him blocking his way
oh theres a fiery retort
under his breath how about fuck you
id believe it if you said it a little louder
ramirez controls his anger which is starting to show through in the bulging veins
look at these guys
you dont belong with them
you belong with me
what did darth vader say to luke
come over to the dark side
you have no idea of the power we have
i told you i didnt want anything to do with you
hows it going to look in your jacket
your country came to you requesting help and you turned it down
not exactly promotion material know what i mean
these people dont want you in their club annibal
the answer is no
thats the end of it
we open on a shot of the front door
the doorbell is rung and the door opens after a beat revealing ramirez
we dont yet see who is at the door
what do you want
revealing it is jack who is at the door
i want you to come with me
well then get set for disappointment
then you are ordered to come with me
you cant order me to do shit
just then the cellular phone which jack holds rings
jack smiles and holds out the phone to ramirez
its for you
ramirez takes the phone totally faked out
he presses the send button and gingerly says
into cell phone hello
we hold for a beat on ramirezs look at jack who stands there unable to keep from smiling
a helicopter lands in its air ambulance spot outside the emergency room entrance of bethesda naval hospital
out step ramirez and jack
they cross over to the hospital entrance
we see a sign on the wall identifying this as bethesda naval jack is there with ramirez
he hands ramirez a white lab coat and puts one on himself
ramirezs coat has a tag he doesnt even notice which says dr
ramirez on it
put it on
because i just told you to
you need a phone call for that too
ramirez resignedly puts the coat on
jack and ramirez walk down the corridor
the boy was flown here from germany
his parents are u
a bomb was planted in a grocery store that was frequented mainly by u
they believe it was carlos or one of the cells he runs
how old is your kid
this last is asked almost as an afterthought
quietly hes six
so is this kid
in the hospital bed is a six year old swathed in bandages
the child is pitiful with ivs sticking in him and tubes running underneath the bandages and a heart monitor beeping weakly above him
his parents sit next to his bed
the father wears the khaki uniform of a naval lieutenant
on jack and ramirez
they watch this scene through the little window in the door and then they enter the room
the parents turn to them as they enter
the parents wear the look all parents wear in their childrens hospital rooms at the signt of the doctor who may be able to save their childs life
a look of hope
a look of desperation
hello doctor shaw
is this the specialist you told us about
doctor ramirez lieutenant and mrs
the parents of the child who was wounded in the terrorist attack
ramirezs eyes dart in panic from jack to the newcombs
they stick out their hands
finally he offers his
youre the one whos going to do the surgery
hes going to help out
they told us you were the best person in the world to do this
hes the only one
jack turns to ramirez
heres the boys chart doctor
as you can see one kidney was destroyed by the shrapnel
theres a large perforation in the left lung the spleen the large intestine the stomach lining were all torn
there are over a hundred individual shrapnel fragments
it was obviously designed by carlos to maim not to kill
hold on ramirezs look of helplessness which turns to anger
ramirez and jack walk down the corridor
ramirez is tearing off the lab coat
what kind of a sadistic son of a bitch are you
you use those poor people
you use anything to get what you want
jack reaches into the large pocket of his lab coat and pulls out a small photo album the kind families use to put in the photos of their vacations
he puts it into ramirezs hand
to get what i want
he hands him the photo album
these are pictures of just some of carlos victims
most of them are children
we havent had time to get that kids picture in yet
up until i heard about you all we could do about carlos was take pictures of his victims
i wasnt lying to those people
you are the only one who can do anything about carlos
im not the bad guy annibal
im just trying to make you see the choices
ramirez is still too angry to speak
who are you angry at
me for bringing you down here or carlos for blowing up that kid
which of us deserves your anger
ramirez sits at his desk looking at the presentation book jack gave him
the study is a reflection of the man navy pennants photos ships in bottles family photographs
he is very much at home in this sanctuary
photos of victims
bloodied children women men each atrocity labeled with the place of the attack and number of dead and wounded
just then there is a knock at the door
ramirez closes the book and covers it with a newspaper as his wife maura enters wearing a very sexy teddy with a short robe over it giving off the promise
of a wonderful night of conjugal bliss
what are you doing
i was just reading some
she bends down and kisses his neck
read em on the navys time
this is my time
she sits into his lap they kiss and the robe slips down off her shoulders
he kisses her more passionately now
he is wearing a robe having just gotten up out of bed
it is perhaps one in the morning
joey is asleep holding a stuffed animal
the baby is asleep in her crib looking like a little angel
ramirez pulls the cover up on the baby and pats her gently so as not to wake her and then bends down and kisses his son
ramirez pulls up in a car with his wife and two children
he is wearing his khaki uniform and carries a sea bag
he embraces maura
itll go by fast
not fast enough
ramirez bends down to hug joey
you take care of mommy okay
but why do you have to go
well theyre finally giving me my chance to go into subs
thats what ive always wanted you know
new color subs
is there going to be a war poppi
not if i can help it
then why do you need to go away
because sometimes countries need soldiers and sailors to be on guard so there wont be a war
so all the little children like you and baby yolanda will be safe
why cant somebody elses daddy go on the sub and you could stay here and go to my games
because im the one they asked and im the one who knows how to do the job
he kisses joey stands up and kisses maura and the baby she holds and walks past the guard gate showing his id as his wife and children wave
montreal is an island in the middle of the st
it is a city part way up a mountain mount royale
we track a car as it drives up out of the city up the mountain to of all places a cemetery which sits at the foot of a deserted prison
that looms above it
the cemetery like the prison is deserted
there can be no more desolate place than a graveyard full of long dead prisoners whose prison has long since been shut down
we see jacks car with him and ramirez in it driving into the cemetery
as it does it crosses in front of a video camera inconspicuously placed in a tree
a camera mounted atop a light fixture pans with jacks car all the way up to the prison entrance
signs on the prison proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden
as jack pulls up at the prison a plainclothed operative comes out and as ramirez and jack pull ramirezs bag out of the car the operative slips into the drivers
side and whisks it away
the ground around the area is full of snow that has not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete
there is an observation tower in the middle of the room which has become home to the pigeons who now flap noisily out of it as jack crosses with ramirez
the place has the look of an impromptu military encampment in a bombed out wreck of a building
in the observation room are several nondescript types
jack shows ramirez in
this is an ad hoc operation set up specifically for your mission
when thats over not even a trace of it will remain
you dont need to know anyones name
and from now on your name is miguel
so your name really isnt jack shaw
smiling of course it is
jack walks ramirez down the corridor
they pass the surveillance room the small cell with its satellite dish and single computer terminal and operator established earlier as technician
from here cables snake their way along everywhere
the place has the look of a mobile high tech spy station that just happens to be set up in a former prison
ramirez looks around
the idea of being in a prison is obviously uncomfortable for him
your mother is irish
something wrong miguel
your father was in a cuban prison if im correct
ramirez turns and looks at him in surprise
your mother used to take you to visit him there didnt she
im sure thats a disturbing memory
he looks ramirez straight in the eyes
you didnt set this up in a prison because it was the first piece of real estate you were shown did you sir
lets just say everything has its purpose
no one is to know anything about you other than that youre our student
so dont call me sir because its like wearing a sign on your forehead that youre military
from here on out forget the navy
jack and ramirez walk along until they come to a site which could as easily be in a space station on the dark side of the moon
there in the middle of a huge room looms a plastic enshrouded satellite tracking system
the plastic hangs down from the roof encapsulating this area to protect all of the state of the art computer equipment from the dust
inside this plastic shrouded space we see technicians at monitors which display every approach to the prison as well as monitors which display the surveillance images transmitted back via satellite
this is our surveillance and satellite tracking center
just as we are plotting to destroy carlos if he knew what were trying to do i assure you hed try to find a way to kill us first
jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command center like room
he and ramirez enter
this place is high tech computers and neon lighting
carlos has two main safe houses
one in libya one in east germany
we have satellites that pass over each one three times a day
unfortunately the russians know exactly when our satellites are in position so we have to assume that carlos knows as well
they cross over to the satellite tracking monitors which display both the libyan and east german safe houses
sitting in front of one of the monitors is amos typing controls into the satellite tracking system
theres one person i want you to meet though i think the two of you have already been introduced
amos now turns and comes around to ramirez
my name is amos
ramirez stares at him
i didnt recognize you without my foot chained to the floor
i hope there are no hard feelings
there are a lot of hard feelings
and im still gonna sue you when this is over
miguel this is a combined israeli american operation
amos here knows carlos better than anyone in the free world
he was the one who took that picture of carlos in libya
if you could get a picture of him why didnt you just kill him
dont let all this equipment fool you
carlos still has the home court advantage
he has the best protection in the world
three layers at least at all times
next and maybe most important
the french dst came to arrest him once
he was at his apartment drunk playing his guitar
he actually had them convinced it was all a mistake
then he went into his bathroom took a shave mind you so he would look his best for the interrogation and when he came out managed to shoot each of
them through the forehead
then he got the informer who had betrayed him put him down on his knees and killed him
think of it
he took a shave and didnt even nick himself once
amos is quiet lets that sink in
finally there are political realities
whoever hits carlos has to realize that hell unleash against himself a fanatical wave of terrorist activity in retribution
that by the way is the last question youre going to ask
from now on youll get information when and how we want you to get it
you dont ask questions you just do what youre told
amos jack and ramirez walk amongst the tombstones
jack and amos have warm coats
ramirez does not
he shivers in the cold but tries not to show his discomfort
this is going to be unlike any learning experience youve ever had before
for one thing were going to push to all your limits
fatigue frustration and fear
were going to make you more terrified than youve ever been in your life just to see how you handle the fear
any other learning experience you get things ninety nine point nine nine nine percent right you get an a
here if you get things ninety nine point nine nine nine percent right
jack walks right up to ramirez and mimes a gun with his thumb and index finger and puts it right up to ramirezs temple and goes
and ill tell you the truth
i honestly in my heart of hearts dont care whether you live or die
dont take that personal
i dont care whether i live or die
i do care about getting carlos
thats all i care about
but nothing personal right
im not as cold blooded as my american friend
it would bother me very much if you were dead
so we will teach you to stay alive
but no questions
he puts the imaginary gun to ramirezs temple
when do we start
you already have
what were the names on the last three tombstones you passed on your right
i dont know i wasnt looking
i wasnt paying attention
thats what will get you killed
carlos is always looking
always paying attention
because carlos is the master of the techniques of survival which we will teach you and because he is an efficient killer for whoever employs him then for him there
are simply no rules
unlike you miguel youre a rule follower arent you
ramirez says nothing
carlos is the opposite of that and thats whats so seductive you know
he can kill whomever he chooses
ravish whoever he chooses
take whatever he chooses
whatever he chooses
it is to be in many ways a superman not bound by the mores or morals of humanity
and if you learn what we can teach you youll be one too
if not youll be dead
it is a huge empty room
ramirez sits at the lone table as amos enters
ramirez is eating a bowl of porridge
his breath steams out in the cold
the room is freezing but instead of a warm jacket he wears light prison overalls
hows the porridge you like it
its not bad
he finishes whats left in the bowl
amos reaches over to a side warming table
there is a huge pot of porridge there
finish everything in the pot
theres got to be like
eight helpings in there maybe
from now on unless otherwise indicated ramirez is in the too tight shirt and tie and light jacket
jack is in the distance observing
ramirez is doing furious situps hanging off the balcony of one of the tiers with his feet linked under one of the bars so that as he does his sit
up it is over an abyss
amos stands in front of ramirez puffing on a cigar as he speaks so that ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he exercises
name and place of birth
doctor jose altagracia ramirez
do you have to smoke that cigar
there is a silence between them
this is obviously the end of that subject
then amos goes on
carlos father abandoned him and his mother because he wanted to be a playboy
your father abandoned you in effect when he was sent to prison
either way its a lonely child missing his father
i want you to take what you know of your real father and superimpose it onto this the image of carlos father so when you talk of one you are
talking of the other with the same emotion
the same love the same resentment
the same sadness the same anger
as jack and ramirez walk toward the cemetery we see ramirez who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in the cold in contrast to jacks heavy winter
ramirez carries what appears to be a gun
you need to not only remember the names on every tombstone but where they are so when i call out a name you whirl and shoot
they walk into a scene that is completely surreal
standing behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers
each man wears a white parka and white pants against the freezing cold
in the center of their impromptu circle stands ramirez also wearing white but of much lighter material so that he shivers in the cold
all of them including ramirez hold paint pellet guns
it is a cemetery full of living targets which can shoot back
jack stands outside the circle
its kind of cold
you think i might be able to borrow a warmer jacket from someone
we dont want you to be comfortable
thats just what will get you killed
ramirez hesitates a moment trying to remember where the tombstone with the name brisson is
the trainer who stands behind the brisson tombstone has no such hesitation
he fires at ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes on ramirezs white suit
ramirez shakes his head in frustration
ramirez whirls misses one is hit again with another black splotch but hits the paquet tombstone square in the chest with a black splotch of his own
in the middle of a huge room a movie set has been erected
there are flats supported by sand bags which form the set of a kitchen
the set is perfect in every way but its position inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre since no movie is being shot here and
no audience will ever see these performances
jack is there with ramirez
he opens the refrigerator and ramirez looks inside as jack times him on his watch then closes the refrigerator
he has caught a cold but must ignore it
some milk some juice maybe some cottage cheese a couple bottles of beer some tomatoes
i dont know
what kind of milk how many cartons open or closed what kind of juice how full was the bottle was it cottage cheese or cream cheese how many bottles of
beer how many tomatoes
this is life and death
jack opens the cupboard
ten seconds how many cups saucers plates look this time
ramirez sits practicing his venezuelan accent in english repeating phrases he hears from a native speaker on a tape recorder as he eats another of the interminable bowls of porridge
ramirez once again stands in the center in his lightweight white parka surrounded by trainers in heavy white parkas
jack is nearby
heres the thing about carlos
he doesnt fit any mold
his father is an extraordinarily wealthy playboy whos a marxist at the same time
ramirez whirls and misses and is hit by the trainer
jack shakes his head and continues
the guys such a fanatic he names his three sons after lenin
and i dont mean john
the same thing is true for carlos
hes a guerilla fighter who loves champagne and caviar
ramirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at the same time that he himself is hit
jacks look betrays no emotion
he doesnt want to be che guevara he wants to be the james bond of the peoples liberation front
its not so much radical chic as an excuse for sadism
as he says this last ramirez whirls and shoots another trainer dead in the chest
he is beginning to enjoy playing terrorist
we are speeding down the road in a suped up open jeep pov ramirez who is driving
suddenly we see jack and amos up ahead
amos pulls a lever and a barrier snaps up at chest level across the road
we jam on the brakes and ramirez is at the wheel
suddenly he sees the barrier plate a hundred yards in front
he hits the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time
the tires scream and leave black tracks as the jeep slides sideways towards the barrier
just before reaching it the car completes a degree turn and roars back but at the last second fishtails and swerves off the road
he is obviously frustrated
he shakes his head in disgust
ramirez and jack walk together on the belvedere which is an observation area with a railing around it overlooking the abandoned prison
in between the belvedere and the prison is a field which is almost completely barren except for one tree
it sits down below
in the distance we see a snow mobile approach with its lights on
just then jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter and slips it into the front pocket of ramirezs jacket turning it on as he does
its a transmitter
youre the target
jack quickly moves away from ramirez
as ramirez moves he notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well and continues to home in on him
and then there is a second snow mobile
and then a third all of them coming straight for him
he starts to run
the snow mobiles turn and continue bearing down on him driving him closer toward the railing
we see the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas evidently homing in on his transmitter
jack who has moved quite a ways off pulls out a beretta and sets it on the rail
we see on the snow mobiles a lit up remote device
if you shoot out the receivers theyll stop
there are ten rounds in this clip
the first two are live the next three dummy then three live two dummy
ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant and then goes running for the gun
he cannot make it to the gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him
he is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow
the snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through the rail falling down to the field below
ramirez is up and running grabs the gun fires two rounds and misses then hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow mobile draws closer
then he fires and hits a headlight then fires and misses then fires and hits the remote device
that snow mobile stops in its tracks
the third now barrels down on ramirez
he clicks off two dummy rounds and just before the snow mobile hits him a shot rings out
the receiver shatters and we see jack standing with the smoking gun with which he has just saved ramirezs life
three times dead
it is after lunch and jack and amos are eating ice cream sundaes while ramirez sits eating the last bit of porridge from the huge bowl
you finish all your porridge
i finished all my porridge
good now you can have some more
he motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot and starts to ladle it out into ramirezs bowl
ramirez reaches up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button
ramirez explodes batting the waiters hand away and sending the bowl flying
enough of this porridge shit man hi jo deputa
fuck it man
i aint eatin no more of this shit
and i aint wearin this fuckin shirt anymore either
with that he rips off the tie and rips open the shirt
why miguel amigo whatever is the matter
ill tell you what the matter is man
i been here twelve mother fuckin weeks an all ive had to eat the whole time is this shit
and those dumb ass basketball games
you damn near kill me with those fucking snowmobiles
i havent seen my family in three months and i still dont know what any plan is or what im supposed to be doing
youre acting like a child
like a spoiled brat
and not a navy lieutenant commander which is exactly what would get you killed
finally youre acting like a willful spoiled child which is just what carlos was
we couldnt just let you study carlos
if this thing is going to work you have to become him
ramirez looks at him in disgust
the two most elite intelligence services in the world and the best you can come up with is this porridge bullshit
as a child carlos was fed that porridge that you love so much every day
he hated it
every woman or man hes ever been close to he told about that porridge
how the very smell of it made him sick
and now it makes you sick
when he was in school he was a scrawny little kid
the last one to get picked for any teams
he felt as clumsy as weve made you feel
his father smoked cigars
the same ones whose smell you complained about
the only cover that can save your life
is the one you believe yourself
are you ready to pass the next test
ramirez just looks at them in a kind of shock
ill take that for a yes
youre about to go into your house
your wife has told you she was away with the children for a week
she is entering the house for the first time in a week with you
the children are still at grandmas so the two of you have a nice romantic time ahead of you
walk through the house
through the living room and the kitchen only
you have thirty seconds
walk casually through the house so as not to make her suspicious of anything you do and find out if shes telling you the truth or not
if you pass this test your questions will be answered
youll be sent home to virginia and this will be the end of it
ramirez walks casually through the living room with camera following
amos and jack walk behind him
ramirez bends down to tie his shoe near the sofa
he crosses into the kitchen and camera follows
he opens the refrigerator and takes out a carton of milk
he takes a drink from the carton and dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor
he gets an im such a slob look on his face
then he replaces the milk crosses to the sink takes the sponge off the sink and a paper towel
he mops up the spill with the sponge first and then with the paper towel then tosses the paper towel into the trash
as he speaks ramirez himself will be amazed at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques hes been taught
looking at watch times up
is she telling the truth or lying
shes got to be lying otherwise this would be a very short test and i dont think thats what you had in mind
she had a man over
how do you know
she hasnt been here in a week
then why was the sponge still damp
it means she washed dishes
take a look at the dish rack
theres water in the tray underneath it
probably from a couple of plates
theres a bit of water in the silverware tray
the milk is still fresh
not even a hint of being sour and the date on it is a week from today
means she just bought it yesterday or the day before
the margarines fresh bought but its already been opened
same with the bread
how do you know it was a man
ignoring him a beat she might have met him at a bar because theres a book of matches in the garbage
she was probably careful to throw the cigarette away but theres still a bit of ash and that cigarette smell at the bottom of the liner
i think they made love on the sofa because one of the cushions has been turned over and theres the indentation of a tennis shoe print in the rug over
he looks down at jacks shoes
sorta like the ones youre wearing jack
besides i know it was a man because i smelled after shave on the couch
he gets a quizzical look crosses to the couch sniffs
he crosses to jack and sniffs jack as well
youve been fucking my wife
he holds index finger and thumb up to jacks head like a gun reprising his mentors gesture to him and making the sound of a gunshot with his mouth
now whos dead
we have four quick cuts
in each one ramirez who stands in the center of the trainers whirls like a ballet dancer and beats each trainer to the punch hitting dead center on each one
with his paint pellet gun
from the side amos and jack nod to each other approvingly
a triumphant ramirez walks with amos and jack
the plan is to get the kgb to eliminate carlos for us
carlos knows every link between the kgb and every terrorist organization in the world
hes not only the smoking gun he knows every contact there ever was
we make the kgb think that carlos is ready to turn
ready to go over to the cia and theyll take him out
why would they think carlos would go over to the cia
not for the forces of world revolution this time but for him in his pocket with a new identity and cia protection
theyll believe it
if we lay it out right
theyll believe it
when do we move
not so fast
youre far from ready
i would think another three months of training and then
im ready now
give me any test you want
christ i already passed your tests
what more do you want
the sun is just setting
there is the silhouette of the prison in the snow
a kind of dark serenity permeates the scene
ramirez sits at the table in the huge dark and empty room
the table is set with champagne and caviar
he has his arabic book and tape and earphones
studying to himself in arabic shoo ismak
we are in a new setting
it is a kind of dungeon perhaps once a solitary confinement cell
it is crowded here now with jack amos and technician who sit in front of a new bank of monitors
on one we see ramirez eating in the cafeteria
it should be hitting him now
we push in on ramirez on the monitor
ramirez sits as before
he is eating his caviar as he looks at his arabic textbook
it shows a picture of a street in an arab country possibly libya
it is a typical street scene a dispassionately sterile photograph in which one can almost hear the bbc announcer voice in your head saying and here is a typical scene
in lovely tripoli
there is a man in a business suit walking on the sidewalk in this picture
we cut back and forth between ramirez and then as ramirez strains to look harder unbelievingly we push in tighter on the picture from his pov and to our amazement
the man in the picture looking back up at us is ramirez
then suddenly the man in the picture moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us and says shhhhh
just then a street vendor in the same scene pulls out a gun and shoots ramirez in the picture in the head
ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still shot of ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of
beautiful downtown tripoli
he looks out the window at the bluish sky as we shift focus between him and his background
he looks down at the bowl of porridge
it is crawling with ants
ramirez picks up the bowl and throws it across the room
he gets up looks at the tv camera and walks down the corridor to the observation room
ramirez walks down the corridor past the surveillance room
the satellite dish is still there but there are no technicians to be seen
he follows the cable that snakes down the corridor towards the command room
ramirez walks along the cable until he comes to the plastic enshrouded satellite tracking system
he pulls one of the plastic panels to discover that the place is totally empty
he bends down and picks up the cable as if it were a lifeline on a strip at stormy sea
he follows it hand over hand to where all the equipment was its gone
he looks around and through the plastic starts to see the silhouettes of people moving and talking
abruptly he pulls the panel aside just some pigeons against the moonlight shafts
ramirez enters the observation room with its looming observation tower that now has become home to the hundreds of pigeons inside it
the place is completely deserted
at the sound of his shout hundreds of pigeons explode out of the observation tower like bats in a primal cave
ramirez instinctively crouches in terror
amos you piece of shit
coos echtak ya sharmuta
it is blurry and then there are brilliant flashes that cut across our eyes slicing across our vision blinding us
ramirez knows they have doped him
so she tried the first bowl of caviar and said thats too hot and she tried the second bowl and said thats too cold and so she tried the third
little itsy bitsy bowl of caviar that belonged to little miguel and that turned into maggots and that was just right
ramirez runs down the corridor
there are cells on either side of him now
they are empty
he is trying to hold onto his sanity
the cells are now full and each of the cells contains
he is trying to get out of all of them
ramirez is in carlos black jeans and t shirt
ramirez is in his dress white navy uniform
ramirez is dressed as a doctor operating on a patient with jack assisting him
ramirez pulls a brain out of the patients head
heres the problem doctor
he needs a new brain
he tosses the brain to jack who catches it
jack eats the brain
and tasty too
as he walks down the corridor
it morphs from his own hand to that of a child and the childs hand gives birth to a womans hand who morphs up alongside of him
it is ramirezs mother
child ramirez and his mother walk down the corridor behind two cuban prison guards
the cells are full of cuban political prisoners
there are shouts and screams of agony from men being tortured somewhere far off
they reach ramirezs fathers cell
child ramirez reaches out for his fathers hand
a guard pushes his hand away
ramirezs father speaks in spanish
vaya mi hijo
they come flapping their wings dive bombing at us
he walks in his black jeans and t shirt
the cells are empty around him but up ahead he hears the sounds of someone making love
well not making love
he approaches the sounds and there in one cell is is wife maura under carlos humping away at her
carlos looks up at ramirez
in cell humping maura
looking at ramirez i think she likes me better
dont you baby
she likes it rough
you never knew that
ruh mi hun
he motions for ramirez to leave
he is about to rush the cell when more pigeons come flapping down at him
he turns and
the pigeon becomes a dove gliding in a shaft of moonlight
then it leaves the moonlight and it turns into a crow
the crow turns back into a dove and then suddenly the dove begins to choke to vomit
it opens its beak and out of its mouth emerges the wet slimy head of a full grown ravenous crow
it is coming straight out of the doves mouth and straight at us to devour us
we hear ramirez scream over jack and amos walk down the corridor
they both look as if they have been up all night which indeed they have
both are in need of a shower and shave
i hope we didnt go too far with this
id rather have him wind up in a mental institution fucked up on lsd than shot in some back alley in libya
if he cant handle this he sure as shit cant handle going operational
they round the corner
there looking up at them sitting in a chair showered shaved looking fresh and ready to greet the day is ramirez
he is reading his arabic book
he looks up at them
we begin on a shot of a huge statue of lenin which dominates this corridor
as camera swings around we see a head kgb officer with his kgb aide
over this shot we super the head kgb officer holds a report
he reads aloud in russian and we super english subtitles
from now on all dialogue in russian will be indicated by putting the dialogue in parentheses
the kgb officer is very smug about the report
glancing up from report were just gotten information from our resident in zurich that the cia head of station there has deposited letters of credit in the amount of fifty
million dollars into the account of a mister paulo ortega
it would appear the americans are dangling a very impressive bait for what i can only assume is a very juicy fish
i want to know who this paulo ortega is and what hes going to give the cia that is worth so very much money
and then well see what we can do about that
he smiles with a great deal of self satisfaction
ramirez races down the road in the jeep
the road twists and turns as a light snow begins to fall
ramirez drives and we see that he has an earpiece which goes to a walkman tape recorder
we hear the instructions being fed to him on the tape in jacks voice youre going to hit a hairpin turn exactly three tenths of a mile from the stop
sign which should be coming into view at any minute
ramirez starts to slow down
dont stop for the stop sign dont even slow down for it
youve got to hit the hairpin exactly fifteen seconds after you pass the stop sign
we see that ramirez is going miles an hour down the straightaway
the road is open and straight ahead
ramirez drives on with total focus
the intensity is obvious
up ahead is a hairpin turn
the hairpin should be right in front of you
keep your focus
you cant let down even after you negotiate the turn
you never know whats going to be around the next corner
or whose life might depend on your reactions
on the jeep as it negotiates the turn
we have a shot of the road pov ramirez through the windshield
suddenly as we negotiate the hairpin turn there up ahead of us sits jacks in the middle of the road tied to a chair looking straight at us
sitting straight tied into the chair so that he could not run if he wanted to
he doesnt move just stares forward as if trying to lock eyes with ramirez
as his hand starts for brake you asshole
the jeep turns slightly to the right then sharply to the left
and as its back wheels lock it slides and completes the degree turn
just short of jack
his face is white his stare frozen
he has seen death before
never that close
ramirez jumps out of the jeep coming straight at jack
you crazy assed mother fucker
i could have killed you
you cant let down
this isnt a game
it is life and death
you have to be ready for anything all the time
just then we hear the roar of the snowmobiles coming out of nowhere bearing down towards them
calmly the clip in your gun has three live two dummy one live three dummy one live
ramirez looks at him pushed to the breaking point now
he pulls the transmitter out of his pocket and crosses right to jack and stuffs it in jacks pocket
no rules jack
then you fucking deal with it
ramirez waits for jack to say something
to say anything
jack says nothing
ramirez turns in a fury and starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four different directions coming straight towards jack
jack says absolutely nothing
ramirez turns and sees jack is making absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter
jack simply locks eyes with ramirez
jack is not going to budge
ramirez turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting jack grows louder
ramirez can take it no more
he turns pulls out the gun and must run right to where jack is in order to get shots off at each snowmobile
he fires through the dummy rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles the last of which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both
ramirez is exhausted
when jack speaks it is quietly and with contempt
you rule following pussy
ramirez turns looking at jack unable to believe his ears
you know why you dont fuck around on your wife
not because you dont want to
youre a man
you want to fuck everything
but you dont
because youre afraid it would cost you what
your wife your family your self respect maybe
as we watch ramirez listening to jack we can see him going over the edge
you know what carlos would do if he was married
hed bring whatever woman he wanted home and make his wife fuck her
thats what no rules means
thats what youre too much of a pussy to get
ramirez walks straight over to jack pulls his hair back so that jack is staring up at him and then he puts the barrel of his gun at jacks temple
ramirez is not bluffing now
he has gone completely into the dark side for the first time
no rules jack
were in a fucking foreign country on a secret mission
i cant be here im on a submarine
navys my alibi
whats the count on my ammunition jack
is this one live or a dud
he stares down at jack and we can see that jack does not remember the count as ramirez pulls the trigger
what about the next one jack
live or dud
no rules right
he pulls the trigger
perversely proud yes my good son
think you can be lucky three times in a row
he pulls the trigger
how about four
he is about to pull the trigger once again when we hear annibal
ramirez turns to see him as amos walks down the embankment towards him
stay out of it
its over jack
ramirez stays with the gun pointed at jack
it is obvious he is in a killing mood perfectly ready and willing to squeeze the trigger once again
amos takes the gun from ramirez points it up and pulls the trigger
we have an aerial shot over a date plantation which sits incongruously in the middle of the desert beside the dead sea as we move to reveal a car driving
along this barren road
the camera pivots around the car as we see the landscape scroll behind it the tortured rock formations the mountains reflected in the water a desert scape that looks like
something out of dante as peugeot cuts its way along the road
jack is in the car with amos who drives and ramirez
ramirez has a bandage across his nose
he has black eyes from plastic surgery
jack hands ramirez a small bundle which he opens
inside is a black t shirt and black jeans
what youll wear from now on
black t shirt and jeans
its the only thing carlos ever wears whenever hes not out being a terrorist
its the opposite of what he was forced to wear as a child
the school uniforms the white tight collared shirts
its become like a fetish for him
and to match your new wardrobe in another two days your bandages will come off and youll get to show your beautiful new nose to carla
shes a venezuelan
she was carlos main squeeze about fifteen years ago
shell put the finishing touches on the act
whys one of carlos girlfriends helping us
carlos used her
like he uses a lot of women
she emigrated to israel
now she wants to get even
what do you mean used her
he put her on an airplane with a bomb in her suitcase
she would have gone up with everything else
whats that song say
there are fifty ways to leave your lover
make that fifty one
shes about thirty seven
so its not gonna be a hardship
whats not gonna be a hardship
making love to her
ramirez looks at jack in shock
the way in is a woman
her name is agnieska
its part of the trap
the kgb will be watching her
well make sure of that
shes a more recent girlfriend of carlos
but theyve got to be convinced and so does she
carlos you are going to ask her to do something
she has to believe youre him or she wont risk it
ramirez just looks at him as if cheating on his wife was obviously not part of the bargain
what the fuck are you lookin at
youre gonna help murder this guy you draw the moral line at extramarital sex
ramirez is quiet
dont think of it as cheating
think of it as fucking for the flag
when in doubt close your eyes and think of england
at first we should not realize we are near a building of any kind
we open on a wide angle on the dead sea from a stunning pov
crane down to reveal the silhouette of ramirez smoking a cigarette
we now see that his nose is exactly that of carlos
he has just a bit of dark circles left under his eyes just enough to make him seem moody
he tosses the cigarette and turns to enter a room
now we see that this is a deserted barracks pock marked with artillery shells and machine gun bullet holes from past wars
ramirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide angle of the landscape overlooking the dead sea
he now wears a black t shirt and black jeans
the peugeot is parked near the barracks that sits on the edge of the cliff in b
start tight on a shot of an ashtray
it is overflowing with cigarettes
a womans hand picks up the butt that is in the ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another cigarette off it
she is carla mid thirties hard edged which mars the beauty she still has
she is intense neurotic and bitter
she and ramirez are alone in the living room
she sits in a corner
we become aware of the room
it is a study in contrasts
light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in ruined walls
and yet the interior is somehow soft sensuous with thick carpet muslin drapes and a large bed that resembles at one and the same time a boxing ring and an
she pays no attention to ramirez
she doesnt even acknowledge that hes entered the room
she is in a kind of reverie
the thing about carlos is
he doesnt lose himself with a woman
not with a lover
maybe with a whore i dont know
i wasnt his whore
lovers are different to him
he might have a use for them
so he has to seduce them properly
he has to make sure theyre so crazy about him theyll do anything for him
when did you
she holds up a hand without looking at him commanding his silence
youre not here
she rocks herself back and forth comforting herself and now for the first time we see the bottle of irish whiskey she holds at her side
she raises it takes a long gulp some of the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth
she doesnt bother to wipe it away
it is there next to tearstains on her cheeks
slowly her rocking back and forth her primal comforting the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into strokes caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover
who will get her in the mood for what she must do
she must get herself wet
she must get herself ready
she must recapture what it is to be seduced by carlos
her hand is her lover now
you dont exist until im ready to let you exist and then
you do exactly what i say
she leans her head back and conjures carlos up in her mind
its not pleasure for him
this sick kind of conquest
you know this seduction
hes got to make you not just a lover but a disciple
he brainwashes you with his body
youll do anything
you see because hes the perfect lover
he does it all to
not to please you
but to excite you
to make it dangerous for you and then thats very sexy too to a woman
like he could kill you in a second
but instead he makes you come
so hes almost killed you you see
and you have this orgasm right then and its like hes killed you and there isnt anything left of you and he makes you be born again the way he
wants you to be
so there isnt a thought in your brain that he hasnt put there
not a feeling in your body that he hasnt put there
she masturbates herself stopping just short of climax
then she looks up at ramirez acknowledges his presence and lets him exist
take off your clothes
just like that
i dont want to know your name
i dont want to know anything about you okay
this isnt fun for me
im not here to play soft music and be romantic
im here to help you kill him
at least i hope thats what youre going to do
they promised me it was
take off your clothes
he takes off his clothes
camera shoots from the waist up
youre smaller than him
shaking his head great
carla slaps him suddenly without warning hard across the face
thats what he would have done if i would have said something like that
without a moments hesitation
whats wrong with you
no eres ni hombre
ramirez back hands her and she flies backwards against the couch
lying against the couch
her mouth is bleeding just a little
now come to me and kiss where you hit
she puts her finger to her lip and sees the blood
ramirez bends down to her the passion rising
kiss where the blood is and then smear it on my lips so i taste it
ramirez bends down and kisses her and the blood smears and he kisses her passionately
now go down on me
yes like that
but dont let me come
its got to be when he wants it
ramirezs head goes down out of frame
ramirez and carla in bed both naked ramirez is on top
ask me if i like it
he always asks
he wants to hear it
you like it
harder you like it
you like it
make me beg
beg for it
tell me you want me to come
i want you to come now
you want to feel it all over you
ramirez is too turned on now to follow instructions
oh yeah baby
you make me feel so good
she pushes ramirez back
she sits up gropes for a cigarette
whatd i do
he never loses control
he never tells you how he feels
hes in control
hes the one who makes you feel what he wants you to feel
he never feels anything
she fumbles with a lighter
then she throws it aside and the cigarette
on your back
ramirez rolls onto his back and she gets on top of him
camera im carlos
she starts humping him
her voice goes down very low
you like it
she humps harder
ramirez evidently does
you like it
ooooo i want to make you come
i want to make you come
i want to feel it all over me
ramirez is almost at the point of orgasm and carla reaches down with her hands and starts to choke him
scared what the fuck are you doin
let me do it
put your hands down
she humps him harder and chokes him and he climaxes and then she releases her grasp on his throat
he does that
he chokes you
just a little
she gets off him and lights up a cigarette
then he goes to the refrigerator and eats
hes always hungry afterwards
god i feel like filth
she starts crying and the crying grows louder
ramirez rolls over to her to take her in his arms
get your hands off me
im not him
im not carlos
i dont care who you are
i dont want to know anything about you
except that youre going to kill him
a head kgb officer is with a kgb aide
he reads a report
it seems our friendly bank manager in zurich has received instructions to put a new name on the account of our mysterious mister paulo ortega
does the name sound familiar
i ran a check on her
shes a french national
she was a girlfriend of carlos
the question is
is he still our carlos
or is he about to become someone elses
a beautiful young woman whom we will come to know as agnieska enters her apartment building
agnieska collects her mail
she stops when she comes to a postcard
we cannot make out what it says but it has a profound effect on her
dialogue is in french with english subtitles
ramirez stands looking out to the horizon smoking a cigarette when jack comes up behind him
not the most painful way to burn your bridges behind you huh miguel
what do you mean
saint miguel the faithful husband is dead
long live carlos
youve cheated on your wife
now you can do anything
what i did in there i didnt do to cheat on my wife and you know it
hey pussys pussy
ramirez turns to look at him as if a light bulb has just gone on
i just got it about you jack
you cant get it up can you
the look on jacks face for once having been caught completely off guard betrays the fact that ramirez is dead on
just then we hear weve got it
got what confirmed
he crosses towards them holding a decoded message
the kgb has set up a surveillance on agnieska
and agnieska has received her summons from her long lost love
carlos telling her to come and meet you
at the meeting you convince her youre carlos
you ask her to handle some bank transactions
then the kgb knows carlos and ortega are the same man
then later theyll see you meet with a cia agent
theyll have all the pieces
theyll know carlos has turned
where do i meet with this agnieska
thats where carlos is
couldnt we wait till he takes a trip
i mean libya
the waiting is more dangerous to you than going to libya
weve laid out a trap
now we have to be careful not to get caught in it ourselves
ramirez and amos walk along the road which runs straight along the dead sea
here and there are strands of barbed wire and the barracks in the b
as they walk they pass a sign which says the dead sea you are now standing at the jack doesnt know that were having this talk and i dont want
him to know
nothing can make you ready for combat but combat
jack would be against me telling you this
he would say you shouldnt have a thought in your head that we havent put there but youre not just a box that were going to fill up with our
you have a right to know certain things
i appreciate that amos
its funny i started out hating you
i mean im still gonna sue you dont think youre off the hook for my broken ribs but
but now you love me and were going to run away to san francisco and find a reformed rabbi to perform a mixed gay marriage
listen to me
youre going to feel more alone than youve ever felt in your life
it will hit you all of a sudden and youll think your hearts going to jump out of your chest youll think everyone around you can hear your heart beating
and that everyone around you is an enemy agent
i want you to be prepared for that
so you can deal with it
in the far distance we are vaguely aware of a huge truck barreling along coming straight down the highway towards them
we had an agent
the best we ever had in training
we were going to infiltrate him into beirut and then use him to penetrate the pflp
no student ever scored higher than this man
we set up his cover for six months in argentina
he was perfect
and then we sent him to beirut
he got off the plane went to his hotel went up to his room and had a nervous breakdown
suddenly it seems the truck is right on top of them heading straight for them like monster in a childs nightmare
it passes within inches and ramirez has to fight to keep from jumping as the truck roars past them
it is not a monster just a truck
then again it could have killed them just the same
we had to mount an operation to send in a man posing as a doctor so we could drug him and get him out on a plane
now you understand
nothing prepares you
i want you to know that so when it hits you you dont panic you feel the fear and then get rid of it
you splash some water on your face
you take some deep breaths
you look in the mirror and when you look in that mirror i dont want you to find annibal ramirez
you find carlos
if you find carlos thats what everyone else will find too
and if you find carlos and anything goes wrong hes the one who can get you out of it
because hes the best
after a beat i got a wife i got to go back to when this is over
i got kids i got to go back to when this is over
i want to go back as annibal ramirez
youll need a time of decompression and it will be hard at first but you will
because inside you arent carlos
you arent a terrorist
but right now in order to save your life youve got to be
youve got to look in the mirror and find carlos
do you understand
it is almost said like the offering of a vow
you wont be able to go in with a gun
so were going to have to get one to you once youre in place
how i dont know yet
but well get one to you
youll make your way out by boat
well be on it
but we wont be able to help if anything goes wrong
well make our way down the coast to a friendly state and then fly back to london and from there back to the u
as passengers come out of the plane we recognize ramirez amongst them
a cold dreary oppressive airport
grim looking soldiers and even more menacing security men in dark glasses
in the line of arriving passengers at the passport control booth is a limping colombian businessman
scanning the place from behind sunglasses his heart is pounding pounding pounding
this is it
this is real enemy territory now and he knows it
the foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him
soldiers security men airport employees other passengers
they all seem to know his secret
theyre all just waiting for the axe to fall
ramirez heads over to the customs booth
he turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich arabic family
a young fat girl holding some toys grimaces at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family through the crowd
in the b
we notice a mercedes waiting for them through the glass doors of the airport
ramirez continues on his way towards the customs booth
behind a curtain he sees a man being searched
the sudden harsh voice jolts us all
pockmarked face with exaggerated features
ugly and mean
ramirez hands him his colombian passport
the pounding quickens
sheil el nadara
he barks in arabic motioning ramirez to remove his sunglasses
ramirez does fighting to remain calm under the mans granite gaze
the official looks at the passport and back at ramirez
the following dialogue is in arabic with english subtitles
now and for every other scene in which ramirez passes himself off as carlos he has brown eyes
ricardo moran vargas
tiny beads of sweat begin to form on his forehead
i sell pipes
ramirez nods smiling apologetically searching for the words in arabic
ramirez struggles to appear calm
his hearts pounding however intensifies
for the oil
pipes for oil
after a beat step over behind the curtain
ramirezs luggage is being thoroughly searched by the official
finally the official looks up at him
you can go
finally he stamps the passport
we have a shot of the cab an old mercedes coming towards us and then under the arch leading to the entrance of the hotel
ramirez steps out and hes assailed by a bunch of kids begging and trying to grab his baggage
he looks around
across the street at a cafe soldiers with guns laugh
from a shop window the silhouette of a man seems to look right at us
across the street kids on a balcony throw a water balloon at a horse pulling a cart and the horse bolts right in front of ramirez
as the street urchins continue to beg and grab at his luggage and the taxi driver demands impatiently to be paid suddenly out of nowhere a bellboy appears and smacks
one of the kids who falls to the ground
they all disperse as the bellboy takes the luggage and leads ramirez who pays the cab driver and then crosses to the hotel
the bellboy enters with ramirez sets down his bags and then opens the shutters of the window
ramirez tips him silently
once the bellboy has left ramirez walks to the phone and checks it out
then he crosses to the shutters
perhaps he sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment across the street
he closes the shutters
just then theres a loud knock on the door
he jumps and automatically goes for his gun
but he has no gun
and his heart begins to pound again
the loud knock repeats itself
in spanish whos there
an incomprehensible response in arabic
in accented english what do you want
after a pause i not order nothing
the voice is young and not too assertive
ramirez consults his watch and looks out the window again
everything still seems to be normal
ramirez carefully opens the door
in walks a young rather innocent looking waiter with a jar of ice water
he wears a fez on his head
as he places it on a table ramirez eyes him with suspicion
suddenly the waiter reaches underneath his jacket and
pulls out a small handgun
he is frozen with fear
putting his finger to his mouth to signal silence he shoves the gun and silencer under a napkin
then he takes off his fez and from within pulls out a small grenade and extra clip of ammunition
without any further attempt at communication he exits the room
ramirez walks back into the bathroom
he splashes water on his face and takes three deep breaths and then slowly looks up into the mirror
and finds carlos
we see a beautiful dark haired woman of about thirty coming down the street
there are several other pedestrians as well
the woman is agnieska
she carries a large bag of groceries
a van is parked on the street
agnieska walks along
the van starts
a man whom we will come to know as vladimir adjusts the mirror
his partner nikolai readjusts it and in it we see agnieska walking
the two kgb operatives now both see agnieska
there she comes
do you see misha
behind agnieska about fifty feet behind her we see several pedestrians one is an arab and another a european
agnieska goes up into an apartment building
there he is
around the corner comes another arab businessman type
the first arab stops in front of the apartment house and bends down to tie his shoe
the second arab comes up alongside of him and the first arab gives an almost imperceptible nod
the second arab goes into the apartment house
hes passing her to leonid
for russians they make good arabs
the van makes a u turn and pulls around the corner to give them another vantage point of agnieskas apartment
the two russian operatives continue their stakeout of agnieskas apartment
agnieska enters the apartment
she opens the door and slowly walks in
the apartment is dark
she is about to turn on the lights when suddenly a hand grabs her from behind around her mouth and another hand holding a gun snaps right down next to
she drops the groceries and screams but the hand muffles it
she struggles a bit but the person who holds her hisses
in an arabic accent shhhhhhh
one sound and youre dead
outside the door we hear faintly the sound of footsteps
we still cannot make out who is holding her
he appears to be an arab in traditional garb completely bald with mustache and glasses
he speaks in a thick arabic accent
when is he coming here
he loosens the grasp on her mouth
i dont know what youre talking about
dont play games with me
weve had you followed
we know youre going to meet him
i dont know any carlos
please im telling you the truth
the person holding her still has his gun at her head
he cocks the trigger back with a loud noise
the gun has a silencer on it
this gun has a silencer
there wont be any noise
i dont know what youre talking about
im not from here
i just came to visit a girlfriend
this is her apartment
shell be here tomorrow
the person who is holding her throws her to the floor
he stands over her
i swear to you
im telling the truth
the bald arab who was holding her slowly takes his belt out of its loops and puts his gun back in his pants
he holds the belt as if he is going to strangle her
what are you going to do to me
im going to have some fun with you
he reaches up to his glasses and takes them off and his mustache and false nose
then im going to have something to eat
i havent see you for two years and this is the way you
i had to be sure i could still trust you
he bends down to her and kisses her
i came all the way to this god forsaken country didnt i
ive been holed up in this place you arranged for me for the past twenty four hours
i couldnt eat i couldnt sleep
nothing just sitting in here waiting for you
he picks her up in his arms and starts carrying her to the bed
so why did you leave
whoever stocked this place with food didnt leave much of a selection
i wanted to go out and get some nice things for you
you werent supposed to be here for another three hours
i could have made a nice dinner
ive got what i want to eat in my arms right now
he lays her down on the bed and pulls up her skirt and his head goes down out of screen as agnieska arches her back and sighs
the silhouette of a fishing boat drifts along the coastline
we see the silhouettes of two men against the out of focus backdrop of the city
they are jack and amos chain smoking
both men dressed as fishermen
jack checks his watch
i wonder what hes doing now
practicing safe sex i hope
ramirez is in bed with agnieska
she lays back smoking a cigarette sighing
now lets eat
he gets up and throws on his pants and crosses into the little kitchen
agnieska follows draping a blanket around her
she crosses to a window and opens it
what are you doing
just getting some air in here
dont be so jumpy
he turns back to the refrigerator and opens it
agnieska crosses to the fallen sacks of groceries
forget about whats in there
i found caviar and heres some pate
didnt like the food id left for you huh
his eyes scan the refrigerator
couldnt eat a bite of it
his eyes still scan
he pulls a cucumber out of the refrigerator and takes a bite and makes a face
i dont blame you
he opens the lid on the garbage can and throws the cucumber inside
at the bottom are cigarette butts
camera zooms in on one ramirez turns around to her and comes up behind her
who was here smoking a filter tip cigarette my darling
you dont smoke filters
what are you talking about
he grabs her by the back of the neck and shoves her face down into the garbage can
thats what im talking about
the filter tipped cigarette
who was here
i ran out of cigarettes and
and i was at a cafe and i bummed a cigarette
i had a cigarette and coffee and came back here
loosening his grasp just a little you bummed a cigarette
you know i cant have coffee without a cigarette
i believe you
he straightens her up and rises with her
then all of a sudden he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her
the nearest cafe is two blocks away
a cigarette wouldnt have lasted that long
so you bummed a cigarette but it wasnt in a cafe
it was very close to here
in this apartment building
who did you meet with
that window was a signal wasnt it
wasnt it you puta bitch
he starts to strangle her and we see not ramirez but carlos
tell me or youre dead
he is choking the life out of her
she croaks out an answer
they made me
i didnt have any choice
you sold me out
he is choking the life out of her when we hear footsteps racing down the hall
ramirez throws agnieska down grabs his gun and grenade and races to the open window and goes out onto the fire escape
his feet are bare
he has no shirt on
ramirez comes out of the apartment onto the fire escape
bullets hit the wall next to him and below we see several dst agents shooting up at him
a dst agent appears inside the apartment and shoots at ramirez
ramirez moves out of the way of the shattered window
looking down and across the alley
what the hell is going on
the two russian operatives get out of their van
dst agents from below are shooting up at ramirez
their gunfire destroys everything in sight
ramirez leaps over the railing and flies across the street landing on a terrace
his momentum is so strong that he is propelled through the glass doors of the terrace
ramirez goes through the window of the apartment as bullets continue to fly
he cuts his feet on the broken glass
ramirez quickly goes through the apartment falling into the room landing hard where a family is eating and watching tv
we see now that ramirez is wounded
ramirez comes out the door and starts toward the stairs
ramirez suddenly bangs into a dst agent
the two of them look at each other in shock for a beat
neither was expecting the other to be there
the moment seems to last forever
they are literally face to face
which one will react first
ramirez takes half a step back raises his gun and fires exploding the dst agents forehead
ramirez has a moment of horror splattered with the blood and brains of this man
we intercut a flash of the dst man being hit in an instant almost subliminal replay as if ramirezs brain must register the scene twice to comprehend it
just then a shot rings out from below and ramirez who cant help staring in horror at the dead man flees once more for his life
two more dst agents follow the trail of blood up the stairs
ramirez arrives at the top of the stairs
reaching the edge of the roof ramirez looks across to the other side
the dst agents arrive at the top and see ramirez
ramirez takes a deep breath and jumps barely making it clinging onto a pipe on the side of the building
once again we intercut the quick flashback of the dst man being shot
then as shots ring out around him ramirez pulls himself up and gets away
ramirez checks over the side of the building to see a dst car following
one agent steps out and starts to shoot at him
ramirez fires back and shatters the windshield and then jumps to the next rooftop
ramirezs silhouette runs from roof to roof
ramirez trips over a piece of metal and crashes through the metal roof of a shed and then landing he takes off running through the narrow alley below
ramirez runs down the dark and narrow alley
outside a turkish cafe a dst agent shoots at ramirez
all the diners duck for cover
ramirez shoots out the lights the fixture sparks and flies off its hook sending a string of lights crashing down toward the dst agent the bulbs exploding around his head
ramirez arrives at a small street
in the distance we see the lights of a bright and busy street
suddenly headlights hit his face gunfire rings out and ramirez takes off followed by the oncoming car
ramirez is running from the car dodging bullets
ramirez lobs a grenade at the car
it explodes right in front of the car not taking it out just damaging it
ramirez runs across the street and is hit suddenly by a motorcycle which then veers off and goes crashing into an oncoming car
ramirez gets up and runs into a doorway
ramirez sweating and out of breath scans his new and dark surroundings
while bleeding ramirez suddenly turns around and shoots
a dst agent falls out of the darkness dead
ramirez hears something
turning around ramirez shoots an agent at the top of the building
the body falls and gets tangled into the string of electrical wires
he reaches into his pocket pulls out another clip and re loads
ramirez comes out of the doorway and waves down a taxi
ramirez jumps into the drivers seat pushing the driver aside
when the driver resists ramirez throws him out into the street
a passing truck nearly hits the driver
other arabs start approaching ramirez but back off immediately once he raises his gun
the taxi makes a u turn and leaves racing through traffic
ramirez checks his mirror and sees that he is picked up by a dst car
they begin to shoot at ramirez and his back window shatters
ramirez is driving full speed
the car jumps as it hits the junction of the street
ramirez continues to be followed by the car of dst agents
ramirez turns into a small alley
ramirez drives down the narrow street
the sides of the car barely fit through
sparks fly from the metal scratching against the walls
the taxis mirror pops off as the chase continues
the cars continue to race through the streets
ramirez suddenly sees two kids coming out of a garage
ramirez veers out of the way and misses the kids
the car goes crashing into scaffolding and paint drops down onto the windshield
once again we intercut the flashback of ramirez killing the first dst agent being splattered with his blood
ramirez continues to drive away wiping away the paint on the windshield
ramirez tries to wipe away the paint
the cars continue to race through the streets
the two cars disappear down a hill
ramirezs vision is blurred by the paint on the windshield
a car suddenly appears that forces him to veer left into a stairwell
the taxi descends the stairway
ramirez suddenly pulls the parking brake and the other car hits ramirezs car and flips over it and explodes
ramirez watching the explosion takes off the other way
on the harbor a police car is seen next to ramirezs taxi
the sergeant reveals some blood inside the taxi but ramirez is nowhere to be found
we see the kgb on the scene
the fishing boat enters the harbor
jack stands on the deck as the boat passes under a bridge
out of nowhere a man jumps onto jack and shoves him to the ground
holding him by the neck amos appears and is about to hit ramirez but ramirez grabs amos arm and stares at him
we see carlos villa through the barbed wire
the silhouette of a guard is on top of the building
the real carlos is asleep in the bed with a beautiful arabic woman
a japanese koj enters and taps carlos on the shoulder
instantly he springs awake with a gun in his hand pointed at illich
you must get dressed
there was a shooting tonight
we have to talk
jack and amos are with ramirez who is furious
amos is binding ramirezs wounds
what the fuck are you talking about you didnt know she was working with the dst
how the fuck should we know
theyre our allies for christs sake
they didnt tell us this time
why should they it was their operation
and we sure as shit werent gonna let them in on you being here
that way they wouldnt have tried to kill me and i wouldnt have wound up killing them
it would have been too dangerous
what the fuck do you think that was back there
how the fuck more dangerous does it have to get
annibal the important thing was it worked
the russians have to think it was carlos now
what did they see
they trail the girl
and then theres a shoot out
lets make sure they know it was dst
we can make sure they get that information
if they know the dst was there then what were they doing there if it wasnt to get carlos
she betrayed you so tomorrow we take her name off the bank account and we set up another place for them to get their pictures
we burned libya but okay so well find another place
the only thing that matters is theyve got to believe it now
you fuckin maniac
i killed four dst agents tonight
theyre our allies and they were tryin to kill me and i killed them
i killed our allies
hey fuck our allies
ramirez just looks at him in horror
policemen wind up shooting other policemen
i would rather have you here feeling guilty about them than to know there was a meeting in paris tonight where they were feeling guilty about you
you did what you had to do and it worked
all the training worked
carlos couldnt have done it any better
the head kgb officer is there with his aide
both look as if theyve been up all night
whether carlos was actually in there with her or not we dont know
all we know is there was a gun battle
dst agents from what weve been able to find out
but whether or not it was carlos
if it was carlos and he sent for the girl
and she betrayed him
we should keep watch on the girl
what he does about her will tell us more than anything else
carlos sits in the closed villa with koj and four other terrorists
so the moronic dst find an old girlfriend and send her here to bait a honey trap for me
and then they trip over their own dicks and start shooting each other
there was a man with her
who we dont know
they must have spotted him come in
thought it was you and moved too soon
before she even made contact with you
whoever he was
he was awfully good
where is the girl now
theyve taken her to paris
i want the bitch dead
it wont be easy
if it was going to be easy i could hire a couple of junkies
i want the cunt dead
you handle it koj
hit her in paris right under their fucking noses and leave europe through london
not this afternoon
not five minutes from now
koj gets up and leaves
carlos turns to the others
something else troubles me my friends
how was this woman going to make contact with me
youre the only ones who knew about this safe house
so one of you was her contact
they all start to protest too late as carlos pulls out his gun and shoots each of them
agnieska comes down the stairs passes by camera
a french dst security man comes out of the apartment building first
he looks around the street and then nods
a second dst man comes out of the building and gets in a black renault after first checking underneath it to make sure there is no bomb and then popping
the hood and examining the engine and then examining the ignition wires
satisfied he takes a deep breath and starts the motor and then the first dst man nods inside the apartment building and another dst man comes out with agnieska next
he opens the door for her when two shots ring out both of them hitting her in the forehead
the dst agents scatter for cover when suddenly the car parked in front of the renault explodes with tremendous force and the dst agents are all hit
the head kgb officer is there
the head kgb officer has a file opened on his desk
in it are photographs of ramirez jumping out of the apartment in libya
none of the photographs show his face clearly so theres no way of telling who it is
just then the aide comes in and hands a telex to the head kgb officer
reading it when
the girl and two dst agents dead one wounded
so now we know
it was carlos
he holds up the picture of ramirez with just the back of the head showing
we still have to tie him to the cia
if that is whats going on
i wont make a move against him until i know for sure
because my dear boy
four of his colleagues shot in libya plus the dst and now the girl
hes a very dangerous fellow
one doesnt make a move against such a man until one is sure
and then one must move very quickly and kill him
before he has a chance to kill you
ramirez crosses out of the arrival gate
he looks for all the world like a business traveler who is completely alone
the cafeteria is crowded and noisy
ramirez walks with his tray as if looking for a table
there is an open seat where jack and amos sit with their backs to each other at separate tables
ramirez crosses to jack
ramirez is still bald but his hair has grown out a bit
loudly is this seat taken
no go right ahead
ramirez sits down and now the conversation is in hushed tones
i want to go home
i want to see my family
this isnt the place for this conversation
pissed off no rules remember
i want to go home
you said yourself we cant move again till he leaves libya
you dont even know when thats gonna be
he might stay there another year for christs sake
no he wont
hes gonna make a move and itll be in europe just to stick it up the dsts nose
im gonna go and find out about our connecting flight
he picks up his soup spoon and turns it over and uses it to scan whats going on around him
in the spoon we see koj with a flight bag walking across the cafeteria toward ramirez
koj crosses around in front of ramirez to get a better look obviously surprised to see what he thinks is carlos
koj leans in close to ramirez
what are you doing here
ramirez looks at him shocked for a moment and then recovering
hissing you idiot
dont you know better than to approach me in public
loudly excuse me sir
i only wanted to know where i could buy a newspaper
go over there by the phone booths and wait
ill come to you
ramirez gets up casually
he has heard everything that has gone down
he waits standing a few feet away and not by the phones as he was told
he watches ramirez
something doesnt jibe
passwords were not exchanged
he crosses to ramirezs side
loudly excuse me sir
i asked if you knew where i could buy a newspaper
ramirez stops for a moment
he knows that the line is some kind of code and he has no response to give so he starts up walking again
koj is instantly behind ramirez his hand going into his flight bag and pushing the flight bag up against ramirezs back
make the slightest move and i shoot
and i dont miss
walk to the rest room very carefully
ramirez does as he is told
he watches it all going down in the back of a chrome napkin holder
he slowly gets up looks around for jack and goes out into the corridor and sees koj and ramirez going into the rest room
koj sees one of those sandwich board signs off to the side which says lavatory temporarily closed for cleaning
he pulls it in front of the door
koj has ramirezs head with one hand while he holds the gun on him with the other
he forces ramirezs head down deep into the toilet bowl
the water level sinks and then rises covering ramirezs face
koj holds him under water long enough to almost drown him
then instead of lifting his head out he flushes again and the water level lowers
tell me what i want to know quickly or youre dead
just then ramirez manages to kick back and overpower koj and send him flying back out through the door of the stall
ramirez is back on him in a second but koj has his gun up and pointed right at ramirezs head
they have shifted position now so that they are not facing the stall but the door of the bathroom
koj is about to pull the trigger when we hear down
ramirez ducks and rolls out of the way and amos fires two shots into kojs chest but not before koj can get off a round right into amos chest
in an instant ramirez is on the still alive koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that
cracks his skull
he quickly crosses to amos who is dying
get out of here
ive got to get you to a doctor
get out now
ramirez cradles him
im not going to let you die here
ive still got a lawsuit against you remember
here amos speaks as a doomed father would to a son who still has a chance to save himself from the holocaust
my dear boy
my dear dear boy
i am dead
please god dont let it all be for nothing
get out now
ramirez stands as amos literally pushes him away
ramirez is the brave and dutiful son as his father says coaching teaching him to the last
ramirez is ashen faced knows amos is right and forces himself to stand up and walk almost robot like out of the restroom
on a long shot we see ramirez walk down the corridor till he sees jack
he says a few words to him and then starts to walk back toward the restroom
jack grabs his arm and literally walks him out of the corridor and down an escalator
jack and ramirez stand next to a phone booth
jack is on the phone dialing
a voice with a cool british accent answers on the other end
cousins industrial maintenance may i help you
mister simon wicks please
simon wicks here
this is jack shaw
could you send a clean up crew to heathrow
weve had a rather nasty spill
ramirez is with jack who is on the phone
into phone yes
im calling about my cousin
he shakes his head
ramirez knows it means amos is dead
into phone i understand
he hangs up the phone
why didnt you let me go back to him
if wed have gotten him help sooner instead of
instead of we had a rather nasty spill
is that what it was jack
is that all amos was
a rather nasty spill mop it up itll be okay
dead panned he would have been dead anyway and he knew it
thats why he told you to get out
ramirez knows hes right
after a beat looks like youre going to get to see your family after all
youre going home
for the time being at least
i want him
i want that son of a bitch carlos
and i want him dead
tough shit what you want annibal
koj had a ticket for libya on him
chances are he wasnt looking for you but
he wasnt looking for me
he thought i was carlos
thats what i think too but the director wants an operation review board
the dst shoot out
the girl winds up dead in paris
ive got to go back for the review and youve got to go home
no way man
it was my fault
the whole thing
i want him dead
what do you mean it was your fault
when he asked me about the paper
if i coulda just bullshitted my way
it was a password
you didnt know it
anything you would have tried would have backfired
i had a thing like that
awfully warm for this time of year
the response was yes but not as sticky as two summers ago
the guy says anything else
he even hesitates you shoot him
i shot him
there was nothing else you could have done
im not leavin till we get him
nobodys askin you
theyre shuttin us down
you go back home
maybe ill see you again
maybe i wont
youll either hear from me or youll get new sea duty and thats the end of it
ramirez just looks at him shocked
just like that
just like that
i aint the madam kid
im just one of the whores
and so are you
a taxi pulls up in front of ramirezs house
ramirez steps out of the taxi dressed in his navy uniform and carrying his sea bag
he does not have a hat on and we see his head while not bald is now in the shortest of buzz cuts certainly much shorter than the way his
wife last saw him
he stands outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small
just then the door opens
there is maura holding the baby and next to her joey
ramirez runs toward them and they to him and we see them in tableaux embracing
an idyllic family reunited
we begin on a shot of ramirezs chair
it rocks back and forth violently as we pan up and see ramirez who is fucking maura
they are both fully clothed skirt hiked up fly unzipped
this is not lovemaking
he is fucking her brains out
it is passionate rough sex
maura hits high c as ramirez sweeps books off of a table lifts her out of the chair and lays her out on the table
the two of them climax together
it is clear from mauras look that this is the best sex shes ever had
ramirez slowly rolls off her
he is smiling as well and then becomes aware that maura has begun to cry
youve been with another woman
what are you talking about
what would make you say a thing like that
i was on a submarine
there arent any women on submarines
there was nothin to do but read
they had one of those
how to improve your sex life books
i must have read it about ten times
i tried out a couple of things from chapter three okay
i mean if it didnt turn you on blame doctor ruth okay
you want to check with the navy to see if we had shore leave
ill get you a fuckin letter okay
i dont need any letters
and i dont need you to talk to me like that either
ramirez gets up and zips up his fly
where are you going
get somethin to eat
ramirez comes into the house from the garage
maura comes out of the kitchen
wheres the car
the cars not in the garage
wheres the car
the fellow at the service station said it needed a tune up
i took it in this morning
you didnt say you were going to need it
dont do that anymore
i dont want anybody workin on the car
car needs something ill do it
but i dont want anybody touchin that car
what difference does it make
it makes a difference to me okay
so dont do it

i dont like it
look i just
its hard gettin used to
tomorrows joeys game
lets just go to joeys game
itll be nice
itll be like it always was
he holds her to him
it is little league day
adorable kids are dressed up in their uniforms ready to play the next level of baseball
they have graduated from t ball to coach pitch in which the coach pitches the ball for the kids
there are hot dogs and lounge chairs family dogs and
the mothers are there as well as are brothers and sisters but primarily it is the fathers trying to fulfill their own dreams of sports glory through their kids
ramirez has his arm around joey giving him his last bit of fatherly advice
remember what do we do
keep my eye on the ball
and whos the guy who wins
whoever has fun wins
so you go out there and have fun
he gives joey five and joey runs out to join his team at their dugout
ramirez starts walking about toward maura and the baby
as he does he crosses next to another father frank who is with his son tyler
frank is about six foot four and to say that he is competitive would be the understatement of the year
he is haranguing his kid as if this were the deciding game of the world series
he is on one knee so we dont see just how big he is
i dont want so see you out there dickin around today you understand
tyler looks at his shoes
he is cowed and embarrassed
youre gonna be focused and aggressive and youre gonna play to win
tyler is still staring at his toes
hey you think im talking just to hear myself talk
look at me when im talking to you
frank suddenly smacks him in the face
annibal stops in front of the two of them
hey pal lighten up what do you say
its just a game
frank looks at ramirez and stands to his full six foot four
what did you say
i said lighten up
its just a game and hes just a kid
hes my kid
so why dont we let our kids have a good time
come on ill buy you a beer
i dont need you to buy me a fuckin beer you piece of shit
and you stick your face in my business again and ill beat the living fuck out of you
what do you say to that
there isnt a trace of ramirez here at all
it is pure carlos
what are you smilin at asshole
very quiet a dead man
but before ramirez can move we hear annibal
maura is there beside him
lets go sit down
good idea annabelle
your ol lady just saved your ass
maura tugs at ramirezs arm and frank smirks
ramirez cages the monster inside and turns with maura
as he turns frank turns to tyler as if he cannot believe the boy is still there
what are you doin standing here
youre supposed to be over there with your team
the boy hesitates
frank rears back his arm to hit him
but before frank can complete the sentence and strike his child ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick planted straight to franks head
it is sudden and violent and brutal
he comes down and with one side kick knee caps frank which is to say he hits the top of franks kneecap and breaks it so that it is down
around his shin
frank starts to drop but before he can ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee
the result is devastating and franks nose is now all across his face
blood is everywhere and ramirez does it again
now the object is franks teeth so that when his head comes off of ramirezs knee his mouth is a mass of blood as well
in slow motion ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at what his father has just done
at the same time maura is up and grabbing onto ramirez
ramirez however is not done
frank is completely defenseless now and ramirez leans him back across his knee pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be
this time instead of a knife it will be a karate chop from ramirez which will crush franks windpipe and kill him
but before he can deliver the blow maura grabs his arm
he turns to her almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as ramirez looks from her to his son
and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged
an ambulance is receiving what is left of frank on a gurney as ramirez is led away in handcuffs to a squad car
the cells metal door scrapes as it opens
the police captain motions to ramirez to follow him
leading ramirez through a number of corridors the captain stops at a closed door
opening the door hes all yours
remaining outside he motions ramirez to enter
ramirez enters and sees jack who smiles his cynical smile
little league huh
what are you doing here
its show time
ramirez exits with jack and starts across the street in the rain
i got to have time to think it over
there isnt any time
hes on his way to east berlin
we have word hes planning another attack in europe
hell be there maybe four days at the most
ramirez stops dead right in the middle of the street
the traffic swirls around them
hey i dont know what to do anymore okay
i almost killed some little kids father today
i dont know about anything anymore
hey he was a baseball dad
he deserved it
besides from what i heard his kid was out so whats the beef
i dont know if i could come back from it again
what happened to i want the son of a bitch dead
you think carlos has had a change of heart and turned nice all of a sudden
dont tell me about carlos jack
i know exactly who carlos is
i know a hell of a lot better than you do
but maybe theres more important things to me like keepin from goin crazy
like gettin back to bein me instead of me bein some kind of fuckin maniac
you want to get back to bein you
then finish it
kill him and hes dead and its over with
you walk away from it now and what do you think youre gonna be like the next time you read that that son of a bitch blew up some airplane
full of women and kids
hey the guy deserves to be dead
i know that
this isnt abstract annibal
youre walkin around with his face
sooner or later one of the bad guys is gonna see it like koj did and next time amos wont be there to take the bullet for you
carlos doesnt forget
you help me get him or youre never gonna know when hes comin after you
listen to me kid
i dont have any friends no family no nothin
the only relationships i ever had that mattered to me were with the people i killed
i fucking created you
you cant just walk away now
you did create me didnt you
from the beginning
that kid in the hospital in bethesda
when i was supposed to be the doctor
it was all bullshit wasnt it
all an act
there is a long pause
jack turns cold as ice
this doesnt have anything to do with you and me
its you and carlos
you help me kill him
or i swear to you
ill make sure he knows about you
ill use you for bait
you and your whole fuckin family too
ramirez grabs him and throws him against a parked car
he begins choking jack
he may well kill him
though ramirez doesnt see it at first jacks gun is already out
jack nudges ramirez in the stomach with it
jack is choking unable to speak but the gun is speaking for him
ramirez looks down and see the gun and loosens his grip
you want to try and kill me that doesnt solve your problem pally
youve got a carlos problem
thats the guy youve got to kill
thats what its all about now
and your family
ramirez is there alone with maura
they are in mid argument
i wont let you do it
youre not going back to those subs
its changed you
you need help annibal
you could get some kind of stress disability or
suddenly ramirez bellows and slams his hand down on the counter
maura is shocked by the sudden violence in him
no not enough
whatever is going on out there with your job
with my job
what do you think my job is maura
what do you think is out there
a nice pretty safe little world with shopping malls and little league and ballet lessons
you sit here in your little kitchen and cook your little meals
he looks at her almost in disgust
she sees the look and slaps him
faster than she could ever have considered he slaps her and sends her back into the wall
she holds her cheek
he is an inch away from her face and now he is about to show her carlos to become him in front of her
people are killing people out there
jackals are licking up their blood waiting for the next corpse to drop
and im one of them
you get that
do you get that now
he speaks very quietly pulling the curtain aside taking off the mask and letting her see the full horror
ive murdered people
not safe and clean and surgical firing a missile from some ship but close and with my hands so their blood splattered on me
so their brains splattered on me
and they werent the enemy maura
they were allies
they were on our side
it was just to keep a cover
ive betrayed everything i ever believed in
ive betrayed you
ive fucked other women
ive killed men
there was a woman i would have killed but i just ran out of time
ive let friends die
ive become a terrorist
and ive made you and the children a target
do you understand what im saying to you
do you see me now
do you see the monster
theres another one worse than me and he is out there and he will kill you and the children if i dont kill him first
thats my job maura
and if you dont mind im late for work
we are on the ramparts on the top of the berlin wall
these are platforms from which people can stand and look into east berlin theyre covered with graffiti to the east germans let my people go that sort of thing
they look down over they dingy wall that divides the city marked with machine gun nests and observation posts
jack stands there with ramirez
we used a double agent to get word to the russians that carlos is really here to close his deal with us and not to plan a new attack in
he has a new girlfriend
hes been fucking her brains out since he got here
he has her brought over every night in a limo
youll be dropped near the mansion
as soon as she goes in you make as if youre sneaking out
the russians will be watching
youll go to the meet
its at that beer hall there
you see it
ramirez locates the beer hall through his binoculars
you go to the meet at the beer hall
play it out
let em take your picture
then youve got to get back
theyre going to have to analyze the pictures and see through your disguise before they can authorize a hit
they wont be able to do that before youre able to get back to the mansion
at twenty one fifteen a volga with diplomatic plates dc four five nine two will come by the northeast corner of the compound
it will slow down
you jump in
if you cant make it for any reason there will be another run at exactly twenty one forty five
its your only ticket out so dont be late
who do i meet
whos my contact
my ass is on the line too
this isnt you and me
its me and him
if the russians dont go for the bait for any reason
if the russians dont go for the bait for any reason you will have gotten out of there at twenty one fifteen per orders
if the russians dont go for the bait for any reason ill go in there and kill him myself
and if im still alive i might just come looking for you
across a street with a tree lined divider a large mansion surrounded by a ten foot high brick wall
the mansions front windows are heavily shuttered with little light filtering through
nearby is a small lake
ivan looks through binoculars staking out the mansion
he suddenly becomes agitated
andrei picks up his camera
a mans figure emerges stealthily from the shadows of the mansions back wall
the blonde bearded ramirez
you think its him
click click click
the quick sound of the camera shutters
faintly we hear the sound of a motorbike start up
then we see ramirez on the motorbike heading off
ivan and andrei follow him at a distance
the kgb car falls in behind another car separating it from the motorbike and follows ramirez into town
he passes by giant steam pipes in the foreground as the kgb car follows
a tram wipes the screen to reveal ramirez on his motorbike followed by the kgb car
the landscape is desolate with drab row houses
ramirez gets to a red light
as it turns green he sees the kgb car in his mirror
he jams across the street just barely fitting in between two criss crossing streetcars
ivan and andre lose sight of ramirez
ivan and andre shoot forward and then slow as they spot ramirez buying a newspaper at a newstand
he holds his motorcycle helmet in his hand and using it as a mirror he sees the kgb car in its reflection
satisfied that they have caught up with him again he walks across the street to the beer hall
the large bierstube is crowded noisy and enveloped in a thick cloud of cigarette smoke
its lively at times rowdy clientele is in various stages of intoxication
as the loud oom pah pah pah band plays popular german music those who are not too busy eating talking or emptying liter sized beer steins sing along
fighting the crowd he heads for the back of the beer hall looking for his contact
entering the place they pretend to be camera carrying russian tourists
a common sight in east berlin
he stops and stares
through the jam pack the profile of a man with a tyrol hat who sits along the back wall
busy eating he seems totally oblivious to the hoopla around him
we cant really see his face
as he cautiously approaches what he thinks is jack
it isnt him
there is a sudden look of panic on his face and then he spots jack also in the same kind of hat
lifting his head and turning to face ramirez we too recognize him
under the hat and the new heavy eyebrows and mustache is
he smiles takes off his hat and motions his quest to sit down
hes posing with a giant stein
a slight shift of focus and we can see ramirez
jack however is hidden by the waiters back
then the waiter moves on
a clear unobstructed picture of jack and ramirez up close
click click click click click
the rapid clicking stops only when the view of the two is blocked again by other people
ramirez emerges from the beer hall
he heads back to his motorbike
seconds later the two kgb come out
this time only andrei takes after ramirez
ivan gets into a taxi which heads in an opposite direction
reaching the mansion ramirez discreetly steals his way toward its back wall
then just as slyly as he earlier had materialized he disappears
watching ramirez vanish into the mansion wall
he lies in the thick bushes completely obscured from anyones view and now he removes the blond wig and the rest of his disguise
underneath his disguise clothes he is wearing a pair of black jeans and black t shirt
he looks exactly like carlos now
jack takes off his disguise as he drives the volga to the appointed corner of carlos compound
he looks at his watch
reads as he slows the car to a crawl
to himself come on
ramirez watches as jack cruises by
not till hes dead jack
not till hes dead
jack sees that ramirez is not going to show
a head shot of ramirez in his latest blond bearded disguise
grainy and blurred at first its gradually being brought into sharp focus
pull back to reveal a group of men closely watching the screen of an impressive state of the art computer
we recognize only one of them
at the computers sophisticated keyboard manipulating the images on the screen are two technicians in white overalls
right behind them stands the head kgb officer from moscow and his aide
orders the technicians now carlos
it bisects to allow a picture of the real jackal the splitting image of ramirez to appear on the right half of the screen
the head kgb officer puts on his glasses and takes a closer look at the monitor
the beard and moustache
one of the two technicians toys with the keyboard
the beard and moustache on ramirez disguised image slowly disappear
the two faces look very similar
a huge nose covers the entire left half of the screen
the upper part of the nose only
the incriminating hairline where the bogus schnoz had been superimposed on the real one
the nose is a fake
match the nose
and get rid of this wig
as the aquiline nose assumes the shape of the jackals the hair changes both color and form to match his the two faces on the screen become identical
have you identified the one he was meeting with
his name is jack shaw
the head kgb officer turns to his aide
get me the mfs on the secure phone
i want them out of the way
it opens slowly
one by one a half dozen mfs including the two weve seen earlier sneak out
just as furtively armed kgb led by the head kgb officer and his aide move in through the still open door
he watches the kgb men enter the compound
sotto voce dont blow it comrades
meeting no resistance on the ground floor whose security apparently has been the task of the mfs the intruders climb the open spiral staircase
they move cautiously silencer equipped weapons in hand
reaching the upper floor they hear the muffled sound of rhythmic music coming from the far end of the hallway to their right
the head kgb officer motions his aide to move into the corridor to their left
he does taking three kgb with him
four others including andrei and ivan follow the head kgb officer into the hallway to their right
its long with several rooms on each side
as vladimir moves gingerly into the first one ivan covers him from the door
illuminated only by the light which filters through the open door the room is quite dark
a faint sound of snoring reaches andrei from the bed closest to the door
quickly there his arm goes up
then for a split second the flash of metal as the knife comes down hard
the victims last murmur
followed by the sound of movement at the other bed
in the beam of ivans flashlight a waking japanese is reaching for his gun
and he too falls back to sleep
two more japanese in the midst of a go game meet the same fate
a burst from head kgb officers automatic finishes them off
doing away with several more of carlos multinational gang the five kgb finally reach the room with the large heavy french doors at the end of hallway
quietly approaching the carved wood doors a kgb tries the knobs
the doors are locked
suddenly the pulsating latin beat which emanated continuously from behind the doors stops
hes startled by the sudden silence
not wasting any time andrei and ivan kick the doors open
diving to the side they cover the other two kgb who storm in with their kalashnikovs very much at the ready
the voluptuous blonde her body glazed with post coitus sweat is paralyzed with fear covering her prized assets seems the last thing on her mind
she gapes at the kgb marauders with wide blue eyes
not so ramirezs look alike
caught reaching from under the sheets to replace the tape in the stereo by the bed he instinctively tries for his gun
standing at the door
his automatic no longer has a silencer
sarcastic dont even think about it
it would deprive the kgb of the pleasure of interrogating you
surprisingly he seems quite relieved
that we were your new friends
stop playing games
and its no use looking behind me
your associates can no longer be of assistance
not to you not to anyone
angry comrade youd getter have an explanation youve got it all wrong illich
its you who has all the explaining to do
now get dressed
to the blonde you too fraulein
the head kgb officer motions to andrei who throws carlos his pants but not before checking to make sure theres no weapon in them
he then hands the blonde who finally hides her bazooms behind a sheet her clothes
continuing getting dressed thats what was going on in libya
theyre trying to set me up and youre falling for it you idiot
we tailed you to your meeting
we have the pictures of you with shaw
ive been here all night
points to the blonde ask her
to the blonde tell him
shes putting stockings on a pair of legs that could distract even the most committed kgb
in a voice matching her looks its true
unimpressed we know about your women
now hurry up both of you
with kalashnikovs still trained on carlos they seem unable to resist stealing glances at the blonde
to head kgb officer ill prove it to you
youll be pleading for my forgiveness
lets just go
i want to be interrogated
i demand to be interrogated
he seems truly eager to leave with them now as if confident he can prove his case
dressed with the exception of a jacket he casually grabs one which lies on a nearby chair
the scorpion machine pistol is already out spouting deadly accurate fire
he kills the head kgb officer first then
they drop like flies their bullets hitting everything but him
hysterical she screams her healthy lungs out
suddenly theres the sound of approaching steps
the kgb are down the corridor rushing to the bedroom led by the aide
he doesnt hesitate
firing a few rounds at them he sprints toward the window and literally flies through its shattering glass
ramirez lies in some bushes about fifty yards from the house dressed in the black jeans and t shirt
he hears the gunfire from the mansion
what the fuck
its a dark night and only a few dim lights illuminate the rather large back yard
landing in a bed of flowers he rolls and is quickly on his feet with the machine pistol in hand
securing the courtyard they rush to the spot where apparently theyd seen him land
carlos however is no longer there
glued to the back of a tree the jackal cuts them down with one short burst and goes for the kgbs who appear at the broken window
as they take cover he quickly confiscates a kalashnikov from the dead kgb closest to him and makes it to the high wall which encircles the place
carlos climbs over the wall with the kalashnikov and drops outside the compound to the grass below
he sees to his horror that carlos is getting away
he is ready to scream going crazy
he has no gun he wouldnt stand a chance against carlos but there is no way he is going to let him get away no way
he looks around for a rock
there is nothing
carlos turns his back
ramirez sees his chance he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when suddenly he sees two more kgb guys come running around the wall of the
he mouths the words kill him
he whirls and fires at the two kgbs who fall
he cant believe it
carlos is getting away
he suddenly gets a look as if he feels someones presence
his eyes open wide and he starts to turn when ramirez comes flying out of the darkness and leaps on carlos
the two are dressed exactly alike
carlos is hit from behind and is stunned and drops the assault rifle
ramirez has carlos down and is choking him
carlos looks up at him more shocked than anything else
finally carlos manages to break the grasp and kicks ramirez off
now it is a dazzling display of martial arts
then ramirez charges carlos and tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and darkness
when they roll out of the bushes we have no idea which one is which or who we should be rooting for
just then jacks volga drives up at the side
they roll over onto the bodies of two dead kgb
there is a kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the carlos on the bottoms side
the carlos who is on top manages to get his finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into the carlos on the bottoms body
just then the carlos on top looks up and sees jack standing over him with a gun pointed at him ready to shoot
we hear cars with sirens approaching
the carlos on top looks over to jack who is ready to shoot him
its me you asshole
jack just stares at him and then lowers his gun
lets get the fuck out of here
he turns around and starts to get into the volga
the carlos on top whom we just thought was ramirez bends down and reaches for the dead kgbs pistol
he gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around his gun raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol
is it carlos or ramirez who is standing there with pistol in hand almost turned to jack but still at a disadvantage in this mexican stand off
have you come looking for me now annibal
what the fuck are you talking about
awfully warm for this time of year isnt it
the man with the pistol knows this is a password of some kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesnt have an answer
jack is just about to shoot him when a burst of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and it rips into the tree next to jack who
dives for cover
that act of self preservation gives the man we now realize is the real carlos the chance he needs
with catlike grace he dives rolls and vanishes into the shadows
he has gotten away and jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry or rescue his friend
he opts for the latter scoops up annibal and throws him into the volga and speeds off as cars approach from the other side
ramirez is in bed hooked up to all the monitors and tubes and ivs but he is going to make it
jack is there with him having just entered
how you feeling
did he get away
jack nods his head
ramirez almost breaks down in tears
jack crosses to him to comfort him
then it was all for nothing
the whole thing
no it wasnt
the kgb bought it
as far as theyre concerned hes the enemy now
hell bounce around from one country to the next
but his paymasters have disowned him
none of their client states will risk using him
no onell trust him again
hell spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder waiting to be betrayed
and itll happen
sooner or later
when its to some countrys advantage
theyll give him up or theyll trade him
it worked and hes finished
not for me he isnt
there are still two of us
a car pulls up at the hospital and maura gets out and enters the hospital
maura is there with ramirez
he is in mid conversation with her
we dont know how long shes been there
he opens his eyes
is it over
she crosses to him and gently takes his hand in hers
you have to make a new life for yourself and the children
maura anytime i start a car ill wonder if this is the one that explodes
i couldnt bear the thought of you and the children being in that danger
hell want me and everyone ive ever loved to be dead
i know how he thinks because its the way i think now too
i am so
i am so sorry
maura looks at him imploring him with her eyes
i wont leave you
maura when my father was put into prison he told my mother to take me and leave and start a new life
thats what youve got to do
youre not in prison and im not your mother and i wont leave you
i will not let him do this to us
not the cia
hell come after me
get me a gun and teach me to shoot and hell have to deal with both of us
this animal will not destroy my family
we hear a phone ring and it is picked up
we hear the voice of a friend of hers named grace
listen do you and annibal want to come over with the kids for a barbeque this afternoon
uh sure i think
but could i call you back later
were just about to go to church
annibal and the kids are already in the car
okay call me when you get back
talk to you later
we hear the phone hang up
we hear the sound of a door opening and closing that leads into the garage from the house
we hear the sound of a car door opening
and then the key turning in an ignition
and then the door is blown off the garage as we see the ramirez family car burst into an inferno and blaze away inside the garage in a fiery blast
which would kill one and all instantly
the cemetery is set up for a funeral
there are various navy officers and their families in the chairs
at the back of it all stands jack wearing sunglasses his face a mask into which it is impossible to read any emotion of any kind
there are four graves and four coffins two adult sized and two small ones
admiral crawford addresses the mourners
how does one even begin to comprehend a tragedy like this
a highly respected naval officer returns from six months of hazardous duty
he has escaped the danger we all come to know in the service of our country
he is about to go to church with his beloved family and in an instant
they are no more
they are with god
our minds cannot comprehend such tragedy
only an undying faith in the almighty a faith that says even though we cannot see it there is a plan
that and the knowledge that as in life so for eternity are they together
he whispers to himself as he takes off his sunglasses
now youre free
it is a beautiful island community with clusters of villas overlooking a magnificent coastline
a postal truck winds its way towards one of the houses
the postman gets out of his truck and crosses to the door of the house
he knocks on the door
the door opens
it is ramirez
we dont know which
he wears shorts and a shirt
special delivery letter for you sir
the postman hands the man an envelope
he signs for it and opens the envelope
it is a newspaper clipping
the headline is naval officer and family killed in fiery crash
there is a handwritten note attached
it says rest in peace
not bad news i hope
im so sorry
this guys better off dead
no one is better off dead i think
some people are
he tips the postman and closes the door
mendoza crosses into the house holding the newspaper clipping
he takes a cigarette lighter and burns it and across his face there is a hint of a smile
a very cold smile
he crosses out to the veranda
down on the beach below we see maura and the baby and joey playing
come down and play with us
we now know the man is ramirez
he walks down the steps of his house to the beach to his wife and his children as we we super the following sudan two bodyguard types wait outside the
building at the entrance
an old man who walks with a cane and whose face is horribly disfigured by burns hobbles in to the medical building
he passes a plaque on the wall that says in english and arabic dr
wasfi muhammed m
cosmetic and plastic surgery we super the following the old man locks the door and stands in front of the mirror
he pulls off the burn makeup and scalp wig and we see that he is carlos
several years older but unmistakable
he takes off the old mans clothes and stuffs them in a trash can and underneath he wears the black jeans and t shirt
then he straightens up and exits the rest room
carlos walks down the corridor and enters the medical suite of doctor wasfi muhammed
there is a plaque on the door which says dr
wasfi muhammed m
phd cosmetic and plastic surgery
this is a surgery suite complete with gas anesthetic a kind of high tech barber chair that reclines for full surgery gleaming scalpels etc
mohammed is there with carlos
the doctor is hastily washing his hands
youre quite early
i wasnt expecting you for another half an hour
i like to be unannounced
its safer that way
yes yes of course
if youll just have a seat
ive done everything as you said
my assistant has been let go for the day
ill administer the anesthetic myself
i assure you sir you are completely safe here
he turns around to look into the barrel of carlos drawn and cocked
the scene is as before
the two bodyguards stand watch
suddenly a car pulls up
another bodyguard gets out and out of this car steps carlos
the bodyguards acknowledge him as he enters the building
carlos leans back in the surgery chair
there is an iv attached to his arm
a doctor in a surgical mask stands over him
feeling drowsy now
would you like to see what your new face is going to look like when were done
its going to look just like this
he pulls down his surgical mask and carlos looks up at his own face
it is ramirez
he holds carlos who struggles against the anaesthetic
suddenly a second pair of hands grab carlos as well
it is jack
an ambulance is pulled up at the rear entrance and two attendants push a gurney out of the building with a patient whose face is covered by an oxygen mask
the two attendants push the gurney into the ambulance and race off
