written by matthew michael carnahan joe carnahan based on the novel white jazz by james ellroy legend recife brazil stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror
the breaks occurred a lifetime ago healed uneven
i wear a white tropical button down a republican gold rolex a pirate patch over what was my left eye
and all i have left is the will to remember
i reach into a dresser drawer pull out a yellowed black white picture of her this beatific blonde sleeping
below me is a week old l
times with the headline matriarch of television series empire ridge retires
the matriarchs picture in the middle
and the fear ill forget
slide her over the matriarchs picture the matriarch years younger now
lift my eyes back to my reflection
i killed innocent men
i betrayed sacred oaths
i reaped profit from horror
the names are dead or too guilty to tell
the events so brutal they beg to be re told
legend los angeles fall the battered face of an irish pug
a hard jab bashes the pug out of frame
and there i am next to the ring magazine reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar
lieutenant dave klein vice division
thats what my face looked like before
my point of view now irish pug on the business end of this bantam blacks combos
standing to my left sergeant richard junior stemmons
a partner i never asked for
the scowl meant to hide a shit scared kid whod been teaching evidence classes three months ago
his old man was an lapd lifer who never got past sergeant
we should make our move now
look at the crowd you wanna be at the center of a riot
i dont wanna be here when noonan and the feds show up
i point at the bantam black we let sanderline finish this beating we get his gratitude
junior eyes the exits clockwise nervous waiting for untouchables to break the doors down
i hate the way panic smells when i stand this close to it
we gonna let rock a bye fight too relax junior
the bantam black sanderline johnson
led through the double doors
he sees me then his gaze shifts to junior popping jabs inches from reuben ruiz a muscled middle weight fight taped hands cuffed behind his back
i smile big sanderline im lieutenant klein of the lapd and a real big fan youre under arrest
sanderline spooks steps back
turn and make sure junior sees the fire in my eyes keep staring at junior as i speak to sanderline again
no youre not
reuben is lieutenant dave why you arrest for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps
off ruiz back to sanderline if i was gonna arrest you i wouldnt have let you finish and that hook uppercut combo you got is something special
from reuben beat reubens in custody
but you could be our guest
me junior reuben and sanderline aim for the nearest exit
behind the stands
reuben and sanderline in street clothes hats pulled down tight
feature the announcer ladies and gentleman
due to circumstances beyond our control rock a bye ruiz will not fight this boos drown the pa
beer and lit cigars shell the announcer
fights erupt in the stands
i cant stifle a chuckle
three exits down day late dollar short feds
welles noonan elbows out surveying the scene like a half assed rommel
welles noonan us attorney
ivy league crimefighter
launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in la
unaware the lapd was walking away with his two big witnesses
as we near the side exit i stop
junior pauses less than a foot from my face pointing up at noonan pure panic
second row washed up gangster mickey cohen with a blonde far too beautiful for his world a woman youve seen before but only in a yellowed b w picture years
in the future
i cant take my eyes away
five seconds noonans gaze strafes us
i see him squint
then you can stop pointing at him
double time out the double doors
th floor suite
all four of us
i order room service
sanderline digs the digs sports the ambassador robe over his street clothes reading the bible
if they got shrimp
into the phone shrimp cocktail
over to reuben you want something reuben
to know why the fuck im here mind your tone shitbird
shitbird went out with vaudeville
you get your badge in a cereal box
youre here because we want you to remember where you live
grade school mind city of angels
you live in la asshole
you do not live in federal government
ruiz turns caught me pink
i nod to junior split em
playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes
we get to spend time alone now
want some perfume
junior shoves ruiz through the inner door connecting the rooms
close the door behind them
sit down inches from sanderline change my tone stop laughing
what were you gonna tell welles noonan
watch as he flinches he has a subpoena with your name on it sanderline
why would someone like you need to talk to the u
sanderline staying silent
youre a legbreaker for the mob
i know the men that pay you for that will murder you if they hear youre about to talk to the u
but they dont know
beat small smile and they dont have to
now tell me what you were gonna tell noonan phone rings
sanderline flinches for the second time
bet you they ran outta shrimp
i stand step answer it yeah
the spook with you
catalogue potential whos
cmon we know he is
were just trying to be mysterious whos we
me and sam g
g for giancana
i owe him favors for the rest of my life
were out at the place in palm springs
you should come out for the weekend
tell sam if i get minute yer gonna have to make a minute for him
see we think the spade might testify that sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank
a fight everybody woulda got flush off of including the spade
beat quieter have him look out the window klein
drop the phone on the cradle
step to the window
then i chuckle genuine sanderline you gotta see this
trusting puppy sanderline steps to the window whatm i smash his head against the frame using his forward motion
he loses muscle control for the split second it takes me to pitch his legs up and out
my face a quick change evil mask
feature sanderlines nine story fall
that ambassador hotel robe billows behind him like a cape
he detonates an overhead streetlight with a bomb sound then hits the driveway
unzip my fly hustle into the bathroom screams from outside now
flush the toilet as junior and ruiz pile through the door
step out play it baffled look at the bed where sanderline sat then the open window screams floating up
lunge to the window sanderline post mortem
junior on the phone
ruiz steps up next to me horrified
i keep staring at the smashed body
whisper remember where you live
reuben has to use both hands to steady himself
spartan space appointed with high ticket items like the mahogany table around which we sit
outside echoes of a protest filter through the windows four of us at the table glued to the t
v watching u
attorney welles noonan lambasting the lapd
las version of the young turks only meaner
contd boyce bradley chief of detectives
smartest man in town
and one of the richest dad was a real estate developer who owned a strip of land thats now known as the santa monica freeway
on either side bradleys book ends d
bob gallaudet not the smartest man in town gas chamber bob cribbed my notes at usc law
and tom bethune running for a city council seat thatll decide if this mexican slum called chavez ravine gets bulldozed and renamed dodger stadium
turn it off
bethune leaps like a lapdog hits the power
i was pissing
he was jumping
bradley picks up a newspaper us attorney noonan is accusing the los angeles police department in general and lt
david klein in particular of murder at worst gross incompetence at best
noonan had sanderline scared
after he sang to me he panicked jumped
he did spend a month in camarillo mental hospital last year and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney bin
plus reuben ruiz recanted
so noonans boxing probe is dead
hes got nothing but time a mandate and new targets
i need to speak to the lieutenant alone
bob and tom nod pat my back on the way out proud uncles lending support before dad drops the hammer
i stand step to the window big pro mex protest below geeks and placards baseball is as american as the trail of tears
describe to me your duty as you understood it regarding sanderline johnson and reuben ruiz
take both men into custody before noonan and the feds could and find out what they were going to tell and why did i choose you for this
because im a cop with a law degree and you thought my legal because your a thug with a law degree
because i thought by now youd be so indebted to this department for not indicting and or imprisoning you that diligent honest discharge of duty would be assured
beat and i made a horrible misjudgment
bethune and gallaudet dont think so
bobs happy because he wants to be state attorney general and his most likely opponent will be welles noonan
toms happy because morton diskant whos leading their city council race is endorsed by noonan
thus theyre not seeing the larger play
with calculated emphasis noonans new target will likely be the lapd itself
how do you know that
because thats where i would aim a subpoenaed federal witness plummets to his death in the company of two lapd detectives
beat this screams police corruption
this offers noonan the possibility of payback in the form of national headlines
i wave it all off johnson did that stint at the nut house leak his file to your friends at the times and bradley drops his bomb coroners file
guess the contents
try to keep my heart rate in check
my friends would be more interested in this
beat flipping file open coroners preliminary white paint chips found embedded in sanderline johnsons scalp
a matching dent on the white window sill
i checked with the hotel switchboard and found a call was patched to your room at about the same time johnson flew out of it
beat proclamation it shocks and sickens me that your allegiance to the chicago mob would take precedence over the lapd
fuck drawing this out alright
wheres this going
pull my badge table it gun
the appearance of disciplinary measures taken against you are mandated post sanderline johnson so your suspension will be recorded but sealed
and kept quiet for now
so if the papers or noonan come sniffing around we can provide adequate proof of your dismissal
but youre not dismissing me
just on paper
closes the file since i misjudged the cop i thought you were im going to leverage the cop that you are
bradley slides the morning paper over
front page candidate diskant hears the hue and cry of the underclass
the photo shows a smiling diskant rolled shirt sleeves in the middle of a sea of la immigrants all smiling back
morton diskant is to be removed from the city council race
the means and methods implemented to that end i will entrust to you
throw a thumb at bethune you want me to torpedo diskant so your buddy bethune can win a city council seat uncontested or spend the next month in lock up
before being arraigned on charges of gross misconduct and dereliction of duty
the preamble before you face life in prison for murder
i stare back
feel myself getting fitted for strings
diskant works saturdays
bradley waves me out
i intentionally drag my badge back across the desk scratching his mahogany heirloom
hollywood hills loom in the distance
bradleys stooge now
a smart play suspending me a built in shield for him if things go sideways
traffic teeming up fairfax tourettes like glances in my rear view
a black buick
maybe mirroring my lane changes
five cars back
feels like a tail
they hang a left on fountain
or maybe i just need sleep
cruising up nichols canyon to the pad cameras and copywriters loom on my front lawn
press camped out post sanderline looking for quotes to hang me with
slouch in the seat accelerate keep looking back
dig that geek from the hearld pissing in my hedges
up the walkway
retreat to megs
my kid sister and only living family
mom and pop died in when their first plane ride became their last
scoop megs la herald of the ground
headlines condemn me
tuck it under my arm as meg opens the door glances from paper to me i already got the times inside
silver tea pot over blue flame on olive drab stove
the times open on the table between us
same shitty headlines
how much is true
how many times have i lied to you
hope it suffices
youve always liked your men mean
she looks up at me
feels the shame i shun
what would mom and dad say
thats where i learned it
she stands goes to the stove
yeah pour me
a cup please
black no sugar
meg stares darts
i smile to defuse
she fetches cups and saucers
quiet while we wait for the pot
and quiet always means creeping sleep an enemy i never stop fighting
force my eyes open shift in my seat ive been exhausted for years
i drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you see the hell i see when sleep wins fire where the clouds should be pop in a backseat
point blank tommy gunning two smiling men pop marine fatigues soaked in blood plunging my bayonet into a cheesecake white belly pop that beautiful blonde from the olympic smiling pop awake
my leg jerks kicks a big wing tip
a cup of coffee pipes in front of me
i turn pete bondurant has his hands on my sisters shoulders
big pete bondurant
one time la sheriff
bounced when he beat dead a prisoner who spit at him
a duly impressed howard hughes hired him on as his full time muscle
my sisters new hump
my oldest living friend
turns back at me you look like death taking a shit
hes still got that mgm face
youre still the only guy who ever traded movie potential for police work
because in the movies they make you pull your punches
drain my mug
to pete wanna do lapd a favor tonight
were going to the cocoanut pete puts an extended index finger in front of megs lips which she bends backwards
favor mean free
means an hour
gimme the phone so i can find another date youre the only woman i know who calls men youre the only man i know who doesnt call women
pete laughs then what are we doing
me and junior in the car
pete street side tucked into the shadows mimes jacking off checks his watch
glance again at the file in my lap morton diskant a man who preferred migrant workers to million dollar ballparks
beating bethune in their city council race despite getting outspent to
beat if he wins the dodgers dont get a stadium mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles from city hall and bradley makes sure i burn for sanderline johnson
junior in the backseat penning in a steno mouthing something to himself
junior brought along because he begged
already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge
you got a birthday coming up
on the th right
what are you writing
head down scribbling mid sentence makes me wait a beat
about work what work
mostly compare and contrast stuff
street work versus textbook chapter dont write shit down
chapter or other cops might kill you
juniors look practiced in a mirror clicks the pen slides the steno away
so you think noonan will come after you for the sanderline thing
he seems like a real hard charger
bait him see if he bites
the deadest deadpan i heard he was coming after both of us
feature real concern from junior
is this true
im seriously thinking about turning junior
testifying against you
junior goes sour
gets hes being goosed
i laugh glance out the windshield see diskant finally exiting the office
here we go
i start the car slow roll up the street
my hamilton says pm
pete walking in diskants direction now as i continue to roll toward both
pete close dig his giant head nodding hello
seen pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought pete suddenly puts his back into an left hook hammers diskant from nowhere as they pass
instant ugly crumble
god help me if he ever hits me like that
pete hoists diskant by his waist band tosses him in the backseat
i accelerate out obeying every law
then a series of strobe flashbulbs maybe flesh maybe two bodies maybe both hairy pale
then groaning then flickering fluorescent lights make it all look jaundiced
diskant awake trying to loosen his jaw
junior picked up this quiff jocking other fags in a mens room
but quiff was a law student who wanted his record kept clean
quiff nervous but cooing dick out on diskants thigh
junior just as nervous
reloading a camera
he should suck his dick
put the icing on it
a baffled moment as the comment registers
tell me that wouldnt sell it
plus hes a communist
were ruining his career not his soul
reload the camera
diskant finally speaks marble mouthed
pushes quiff away off me
dont waste a second grab diskant by the hair narrate his immediate future
drop out of the city council race or i send these pictures to the papers
diskant rips his head free
blood from his mouth
scanning the room sizing up the situation then ill fight you rotten and maybe salvage something thats a close cousin to respect
but what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures
wait for the big futile scream struggle
diskant just sits
and now i wish hed cry throw punches anything
but he doesnt
i turn to junior take the quiff home
my names franklin of course it is
junior pulls quiff out the door
by his hand
just pete me and diskant now
silent moments drag sour
i need a nod from you morton lets me know you get it dont say my name
he gets it
someone from the times will call for a quote
whatever your reason for dropping out make it real
as pete and i turn to leave not looking at us you eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things youve done to people
a long moment on me and pete
blunted by what we just heard
tune to an all night jazz signal turn up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts
toss pete his cut
pocketing the money yknow hughes has a job youre tailor made for
i already gave him your
stop pretending youre not a pig for all this klein
i still got a day job pete tossing more bantamweights out windows
i wait too long answer in too high a voice the mutt jumped
laughs small then not even the people who dont know you believe that
if somebody from the das office decides to dig you could fry boy o
be nice to be in with a billionaire whos got a fleet of planes fly you outta the country on a moments notice
beat cmon its a cake legal gig
he just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him
stop in front of megs place
pete leaves the engine running jumps out
hughes aircraft pm itll be worth it
i watch pete go into megs place
a block away black buick parallel to me
like theyre waiting
i keep my eyes on the rear view as i pass
but it just stays put
lights off but something grabs my eye instantly
kitchen table a manila envelope
usc season tickets
a note thanks for proving flying monkeys only live in oz
flip to the same jazz station
start another futile fight with sleep
the last thing i see before i nod black my war trophy a japanese officers samurai sword mounted on my mantle
artillery barrages from hell okinawa
a hate fueled frenzy hacking up half starved jap soldiers
they dive off the cliffs to escape me this massive gray eyed marine
i dive after them
bombing toward a world below already ablaze
gaining on a figure in a bathrobe
this guttural scream turns mechanical like a ring as i recognize sanderline johnson his pieced together face smiling up
my phone ringing
rip the phone from the wall klein you know who hector magdalena is
as cobwebs clear yeah
his home was broken into at some point within the last hour
so send robbery

beat closer now close this quick
clarity finally dissolving the bloodshot this is the disaster bradley was talking about the god sized problems i triggered tossing sanderline take shape the lapds sanctioned dope pusher vanishes thats
a pretty juicy spot to stick a new probe
all money no taste
in the foyer a wilshire station six pack interviews the old biddie in a threadbare bathrobe
dyed orange hair and a burnt butter grin
leans lunges as she relays her story
i zoom in to catch the performance

shes also reported flying saucers so
see if any of the other neighbors can verify this peeper thing

feature matching bullet wounds right between their eyes yell to the officer with the biddie as he pokes his head around the corner the old lady hear dogs barking
no i asked
just the yelling
examine the wounds closer
catch myself petting the deceased pooches
to junior she didnt hear barking
so they were either lousy guard dogs
or they knew the killer
point to the wounds you cant hit something this clean unless youre point blank
he couldve been petting them when he fired look at the burn pattern point like when you shoot something with a silencer
how do you know that
stare so he gets it ive shot things with silencers
and the old lady didnt hear any gunshots

i want to talk to bradley first
where are the mother and daughter

front page leading candidate bows from city council race next to a picture of diskant
pissed for reasons i wont name
back to the car
a black buick passes slower than the rest of traffic act like im oblivious
i slide in start my pontiac
another black buick
call it a fed tail
noonan already up my ass
beat lets see if they got guts enough to keep following me south
cruising the crenshaw district up through central ave
dispatch gave me tommys make and model a ford deuce with a bent eight
hot rodder tommy liked to goose the cops into giving chase
check my mirrors
that black buick hangs way back
cruise past jazz clubs the savoy joe morriss plantation shepps playhouse the down beat
no sign of a ford deuce
pull up to the club alabam
valets stare a white man in watts at this hour can only be cop
half a block back buzzcuts in that black buick
noonan tail confirmed fed faces glow like martians this far down crenshaw
smile big give em a thumbs up
barely sober patrons sport cop hate stares some on reflex some because of sanderline johnson
doorman escort the bewildered strong arm the belligerent
almost am and the club is still half full
press on scan the stage a bebop trio toils over an erroll garner tune as a beautiful black girl sings in a satin soft lilt
this whispering falsetto that makes your hair stand on end
i stop and listen
get my only smile of the day from her
smile back because her voice reminds me to
hear beer bottles rattle behind and break
squeeze that smile into a sneer stare down this massive bartender
flop badge on bar get lester and get me a scotch straight
the bartender glowers grabs a bottle pours hands the size of catchers mitts
he slides the glass
sanderline johnson was my second cousin peckerwood
i wouldnt drink that with my gun hand
he vanishes behind a stained curtain
feel those voodoo stares from behind
and i switch the scotch glass to my left hand as nonchalant as possible
bartender reappears motions me back
i see a figure stretched prone ice pack pressed to his face rolled reefer between his lips
one time velvet voiced crooner
but a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none other than hector magdalena
only as i get closer do i see the badly swollen black eye
he looks up at me
a voice like sand paper left out in the sun lieutenant dave klein
slayer of sanderline johnson
ygot stones showing up this far south
what happened to your face
beat tommy mag wanted to make sure i understood something he was saying
where is he
left an hour ago
emptied my safe

lester hands me the reefer take it toke geeky belch smoke
at the reefer just never got this
lester takes it back draws deep
too white to appreciate good grass
now watch lesters attitude improve toot sweet hector magdalena is missing presumed dead
tommy is our sole suspect
he spurts smoke sits up like a shot beams
muthafucker there is a god
if only id known this an hour ago
you let him gig here last night
i dont let him he just does
nails on a chalkboard too
he rushed the stage last week when we had charlie mingus drop in for a set
mingus looked at this half mex greaser kid trying to play round midnight said that fool couldnt find them keys with a flashlight
tommys playing days are over
what time did he show up
him and these pachucos poppin switchblades like punks
mops his brow of blood the only thing that was keepin him untouched was hector
beat hopeful prayer is he really dead
theres blood all over his house seems to belong to him
theres just no body
a toke a thought i dont feature tommy for it
my head kinks a bit hows that
how many times has he been in here busted you up
yeah but he aint got the salt to truly take a mans life
especially not hectors
he was scared of him
cuz hector been whippin tommys ass from the time he could talk
what about the wife
beat her too
we used to call that old bitch the burglar
eyes were so black it looked like she had a mask on
and the daughter
lester cant quip that one as quick
shaking his head
things up off the street
hector had turned her out
using her the way the romans used to use their daughters when they did business some pussy to sweeten the pot
rumor was she got picked up in this trick sweep few weeks back
hector was whoring her
hector was an evil muthafucker
lester tilts his neck back points to a long keloid scar that stretches across his throat
born with ruthless bones
sitting up and if he really is dead and gone this game bout to explode
especially here in south central
hector ran it uncontested
lotta cats gonna rush in now try to plant a flag
tommy cant hold the throne
tommy couldnt hold his pecker without hectors help and he knows that
hes gonna bury himself like a tick
good luck turning him up he took six or seven grand out the safe tonight
eyes and ears for me lester
he turns up you get in touch
if i dont kill him first
bethune campaign fundraiser turned victory bash
big smiles beam above sunburned double chins
bethune the nucleus of a press circle jerk
i weave around lack of sleep and a miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up
councilman bethune was mr
diskant dropping out the only way you could have won this race
not at all
my message of civic advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting to hit home
bethunes beam twitches when he sees me weaving past
give him a quick nod get nothing back he cant be seen this close to the turd in the punch bowl
moving by anything youd like to say to future constituents
i like my dodger dogs with mustard and relish
bradley at one of the front tables confabbing with da gas chamber bob gallaudet
as i aim their way one of my favorite men aims at me wearing this great white grin fritz koenig
former us spymaster current head of the lapds intelligence division
he and bradley in the middle of their own cold war each fighting to be the second most important member of the lapd behind chief parker
these functions arent normally open to jews
someone with your accent should never be allowed to say jew again
that accent allowed me to execute many a nazi
then were both traitors ellis island said grandpas kleinsasser was two syllables too long
i wouldnt have expected so public a showing after sanderline johnson
he jumped fritz
koenig flashes that grin again
im sure he did
and where is your young partner this day
working his first big job
might the job involve the lapds most important missing wetback hector magdalena
my eyes narrow but stay smiling it does
koenig nods casts his gaze out over the crowd
ive known stemmons since the academy
he was a top pupil
a peculiar little pain in the ass but very good with details
kid might have some climb in him
look back at bradley reminds me of another pain in the ass
koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his
im puzzled as to why the bradley would assign you to the magdalena case when youre neither homicide nor robbery
theres no body and nothing was taken except hector
he does know how to delegate doesnt he
and also im sure that poor negros nosedive has put you squarely in his debt
something like that
keep me abreast will you
chief parker is understandably nervous
situations like these tend to yield grief
and weve the fbi poking around our garden patch
my ass first fritz yours second
koenigs big laugh again
moving toward bradley now
then flashbulbs pop blind
panic snapping pix of me
relief not me
hollywood types this buff mcman meat type and her
i go slack inches from the press that yesterday wanted to roll in my guts
but now theyre just as entranced with her as i am
she and mcman meat continue past as i stare she answers his questions for him
i think her eyes see mine
then i realize where im standing
focused on me and not her god damned eunuch
i step over speak without preface tommy magdalena has gone to ground and hes got a war chest to keep him there
the only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide apb
we cant risk that
do you make him for the murderer
hectors disappearance is definitely an inside job
that whole family feels hinky
the daughter was all bruises and no tears and hectors hop head wife looks part punching bag
do you suspect either of the women
according to wilhite they were in santa barbara at the time
where is your partner
vouching in evidence at wilshire station
keep him on that
he had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and i trust him more than you
beat find tommy magdalena
focus everything on that effort i want him apprehended klein not killed
what about hector
and most likely dead
find the son
stakeout the residence
put tails on both the mother and daughter i want this investigation working quietly and around the clock
and what do we do if hector turns up
if hes alive bring him to me
if hes dead have him john doed at the morgue until noonan can be drawn off and this fbi situation sorted out
he was operating hector dont worry about dan wilhite
you deal directly with me
now go out the back
i dont want the press recognizing you
swallow my sneer
push through the service doors
headed back toward the kitchen an exit sign
i pass an alcove her
beauty you almost never get to examine up close
i stop stammer she gives me a once over thinks im a reporter
you got a light
searches my empty hands you got a cigarette
i fumble for a chesterfield
she pulls a zippo slow
if you snap a picture of me i get to set you on fire
i smile too wide fuck
i kill it try to gather up the bits of cool that shattered with the sophomore smile
it didnt look like you were all that upset with the attention
good thing youre not a cop
beat hows that
your power of observation leaves lots to be desired
lights my cigarette
i hold it in my mouth to hide shaking hands
dont thank me these things are bad for you
you believe everything you read
stubs her cigarette
you believe anything you read
she starts walking back the way i came
hail mary do you eat dinner
i cant stop watching her even after she pushes back through the double doors re entering the fray head first
i step after her
a reporter finally makes me
random catcalls of klein
shutterbugs beeline my way firing flashbulbs from the hip
close the door quick and bolt
make a note steal bethunes guest list then go door to door until you find her again
sidelong stares on the periphery
muted whispers from desk cops
feature this rookie chump clear a path as i pass
down a flight of stairs to the evidence lockers
junior writes seizure abstracts sealing materials in green banded evidence bags
a pile stacked neatly on the table next to him
that red steno pad in full view
this everything from the house
he makes me wait as he finishes writing
what did you tell the watch commander upstairs
schoolboy proud that this was a random drug seizure
im not using names and im number coding everything
a load of interesting stuff too
points to each stack i got unregistered fire arms more dope than ive ever seen and some mail from business associates that seems hinky
we should follow up grabs an envelope here this one hurwitz holdings hector had some real estate dealings bag it until bradley orders us otherwise
like im speaking greek how do you solve a case when the evidence is in bags
our job is to find tommy
point to the red steno and why is that out
like hes caught im making notes separate from gear change off my glare i thought we were investigating magdalenas disappearance dont write shit down
what do you need kid
a little bouncing ball bottom of the screen
brace him harder magdalena is twenty years dirty with this department
do you think a word of that exists on paper
and theres reasons
junior tucks the steno away chastened
now we need surveillance set up on the house and revolving tails on both madge and lucille magdalena
their alibi is they were in santa barbara when hector vanished
find out if thats real
the tails and the stakeout start tonight
beat can you manage this
junior jacks his chin just high enough to save face tucks that steno away this x ray stare
police blotter gets me bupkis
looking for license hits on that ford deuce
zoom darktown again
tommy dug in deep
startle check my watch pm
cruise in crossing the hangar to pete
billionaire germ freak
petes prime benefactor
nobody had seen him in years
contd now he only communicated through a small standing army of lapdog lawyers he kept on staff
a small effete blonde man geoffrey milteer extends his tiny hand plastic cordial rubbed raw from waiting
attorney at law
a pleasure lt
sorry im late
motions to sit please
we sit at a huge drafting table
i shoot a sidelong to pete
thanks for your time on a sunday
a wink for pete wheres mr
but ive been given full authority to im not contagious
if thats what hes worried about
pete hate scowls me have your fun asshole
i dont find that the least bit humorous lt
yes you do
whats your pitch mr
milteer looks at pete
pete half shrugs
back to me now
an actress named glenda bledsoe signed a service contract that shes now willfully violating by acting in a z grade horror picture presently shooting in griffith park
despite entreaties for her to cease participation in this absurdity she continues to revel in her outlaw status with us
thus we would like her destroyed
what makes you think i can do a better job than your people
bondurant says youre one of the smarter people he knows dubious honor if you knew the other people pete knows
beat so you want to catch her in violation of her service contract
something like that
the morality clause in particular as the damage to her reputation would be most devastating nymphomaniac criminal communist
anything along these lines
once you visit the set of her attack of the atomic vampires youll see the void that is her character
we havent a photograph handy but shes playing the lead female role
im happy to help
but my price is
pete laughs out loud
milteer goes frigid
should buy more than help
for give it any name you want
im a salaried employee of lapd that means ill have to find time off hours to do this
a long cold moment drags
someones been stealing groceries from our talent domiciles
theres no proof that its her but its her
peter will provide you addresses
faux fey thank you peter
we look forward to your updates
dialing the station sergeant pass a message to stemmons i want him to meet me at the one thousand block of south tremaine tonight at and at some point between
now and then ill need him to do a preliminary work up on a woman named glenda bledsoe

two fisting coffees
on top of a hill overlooking the atomic vampires shoot

my black and white picture
the beauty at the fight
the starlet i threw a hail mary dinner pass to at bethunes victory party glenda bledsoe
emerging from a small trailer

this is cupid firing his whole fucking quiver
make sure shes real
i hike down through the bramble
walk past a pair of beat airstream clippers
watch her propping up this silver haired junkie
she grabs a sound blanket drapes him hands him her coffee before siting down next to another woman and rehearsing
i eyeball the rest of the set
winos in werewolf masks and capes holding wooden ray guns spray painted silver one pisses bottle in one hand cigarette dick in the other
the director is a fey manic fingering a snuff box
this is the big armada landing so i need everybodys energy up up up
wheres my alien commander
the pissing werewolf careens back to set pulling at his zipper mask askew covering his eyes
mickey cohen former mob boss
he boils eggs on a hot plate and slings hash to extras lining plywood picnic tables
mickey cohen one time la crime kingpin and west coast mob heavy who now trawls for loose change
winos vibe lapd make a hole as i approach cecil b

not a chance
im still trying to play hide the submarine
you want chief bradley angry
ten years ago i could call for that little pishers head on a stick

whats her name mick
still looking for her why was she there
low budget strategy i send glenda and rock to any event where theres cameras glenda gets guest a honor treatment everywhere with that shape a hers
what she drive
following the tail lights of a corvette
top down whipping blond hair split second visible under passing street lights
glenda pulls into what i guess is her place tiny tidy glendale flat
i roll past no eye contact
around the block
park on the next street over
waiting until i think of what comes next
get out now
up to a fence
scratch it make sure a nuts hungry pooch isnt slobbering on the other side
vault the fence
dodge a pool
over another fence and into
creep to a window curtains pulled
creep to another there she is
watch her elegant fingers emanate from hands only now beginning to betray age
watch her shake her sandals off
arranging three coffee cups on a tray company coming
on cue another car
a cadillac the director and rock rockwell
i crane my neck to get as much of her as i can
she leaves the tray cups steaming
check the window open
slide it up gentle
glenda clearing seats
coffees in the kitchen
lets go over this quick because im beat

its in topanga canyon two weeks petulant two weeks
my bodyll fall apart think of it as days of push ups to the director are you sure about this sid
was this mickeys idea
and i think its brilliant
the two leads of mickey cohens magnum opus get kidnapped
the pressll eat it up
theyll write about gangster mickey the glory days
couple a headlines like that and interest in atomic vampires will go through the roof
to glenda whos gonna grab you
a charmer i knew in another life
pat myself down for a pen scribble on my hand a i n g e is he okay with making it look real he cant hit me in the face
thats a deal breaker
hell be thrilled to knock me around
plus hes holding something of mine so we can kill two birds
hell grab us tuesday in front of the pacific dining car
what about hughes
what about him
that angle can only help us
im dying to know
was he the spruce goose between the sheets
my face folds up jealous sour frown
i reach in steal one of the steaming cups bolt
audible as i retreat hung like a newborn and he called my tits propellers
belly laughter from inside
the real howler fake kidnappings always bomb
tepid pulls off the stolen mug
toss it to the passenger side lands on a bed of crumpled styrofoam
look up the magdalena residence looms a few doors down
glance at the passenger seat an envelope lined with fifty bills
the name bledsoe written across the front
pick it up
thinking i could tip milteer off to the kidnap plot and pick up the other half of my payment
stare at that money thinking i should just give the first half back now
cuz i know right now ill never hurt her
toss the envelope into the glove box slam it shut
two heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars i ordered
cursory nods as they pass
tail lights fade
dead quiet save my low jazz
fighting my drift
check my hamilton
no sense of time
exhaustion steals it
a full hour earlier than i told junior to meet me
i need sleep
lucille magdalena at her window
startling no blouse pig tails big silver dollar nipples touch steam glass
pushes the curtains back even further
adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid wide awake now
i see her eyes arent sex placid or rolled back theyre scanning hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back
this routine had been done before
that old broad babbling about a peeper
the only other link to hector magdalenas disappearance
she holds her scan for a blink a different smile eyes sex placid now rolled back now she just saw what she was looking for hidden eyes staring back at
i look to where i saw her gaze kink
get out quiet
cold for la
flush against my leg
sticking to shadows
cross the street two homes down
closer a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter
glance back up at the window lucille gone a forearm shiver flashes from nowhere blunts blasts the back of my head
nose first into asphalt
too angry to black out
spit blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning
still unsure what hit me
pick up my gun clear my nose of gouting blood stand weave a figure in black sprinting away peeper
wipe away impact tears aim realize my trigger finger is dislocated bent back ugly
tuck the gun use my left hand to pop it back in deep growl re aim pop pop pop
the peeper pitches
visible in the streetlight a red puff off his right shoulder
headlights at end of the block behind me come to life now baritone of a big v
peeper fighting for balance keeps running
i sprint heedless round the corner follow a blood trail panting bleeding my own trail
lift my eyes to see the peeper shoulder through a fence vanish into a backyard
neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus
i cross the street those headlights swerve hard in front of me black buick
i look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter panel
i bounce off like someone yanked a leash
hands pick me up
i fight back before i even see at whom im swinging square jawed types eyes hidden by bureau derbies
welles noonan gets out of the passenger side of the buick
punches me as hard as he can without provocation nothing to write home about
my gun clatters to the ground
thats for sanderline johnson
nod at the peeper trail what were you firing at
the only lead on magdalena were after the same guy you idiot
to one of the goons write that name down magda lee na or magda lay na
back to me no we were after you
but thanks for the name
sag under the weight of my own insomnia fed stupidity
assumed the feds were smart
assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the lapds deal with hector like bradley warned like everyone feared
but they had no clue and i just handed them the whole god damn thing
beat like i said i need sleep
raise my face now eyes intent chin out
first punch you ever thrown noonan
your mom have to teach you how because dad was the same no chin connecticut faggot you are
noonan stops turns back to me blazing
i think i hit the noonan family dynamic dead on
he winds up an overhand right a big bright flash then darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn
you dont want to take him in
i only want to bring him in when i know hell never leave
black dissolves to something lighter then horizontal
someone pushed a table and two chairs to one side space for the cot im on
junior looking down concerned isnt strong enough
in his undershirt
he slips the red steno pad into his back pocket
a balled dress shirt in my hand blood sopped
gaze at my hamilton face cracked am fritz koenig walks in silver pitcher in hand
i gape up still punchy
bradleys on his way down
toss the dress shirt to the floor
you needed some mopping up
who found me
i got there at eleven like you said right as two black whites pulled up you were out cold in a gutter round the block
this blithe little grin did noonan knock you out
he hit me with his car first
a nod to koenig the captain was the only one here at this hour
look from junior and koenig to the window behind him bradley steam rolling our way
to koenig conspiratorial if i need your help later on can i count on it
of course you can
take the pitcher from him drop my head douse myself the cold cuts cobwebs
bradley walks in imperious
koenig moves past ice forms between the two
what are you doing here
the lieutenant was thirsty
koenig closes the door
i refuse to look up at bradley
progress on magdalena
i point to junior happy to play teachers pet no fingerprints
clean crime scene
canvassed the neighborhood
a senile neighbor did report a possible peeper rubbing the back of my head where the peeper bashed me confirmed peeper
bradley turns to me is that who knocked you out
noonan knocked me out
beat hes having you tailed then
and he knows the magdalena name and that i was chasing a suspect the peeper lucille strips for
she knows someone watches
and who he is
she has to
back to bradley i want access to her juvie sheet or whatever arrest records exist
rumor was hector whored her out to dealers he did business with
as my teeth grit it is if youre eliminating her as a suspect
did you confirm their alibi
point to the ever studious junior
i spoke with a mr
preston mott of santa barbara the parents of madge magdalena nee mott and theyve confirmed their visit and also corroborated the argument that resulted in them leaving early
back to me now one alteration to my previous orders previous orders being what
assign the cop noonan blames for his dead boxing probe to the case thats becoming his new crusade
bradley conjures the roman visage
then slowly opens the door staring holes in me
step out stemmons
junior balks looks my way tries to mimic my sneer
i stand and shove him toward the door
his look back at me judas
bradley closes the door behind him
no direct approach on the mother or the daughter
madge was a battered wife and lucille was a suborned whore
if thats not motive what is
you want answers then we brace those two hard
if you do so directly if theyre formally questioned then noonan may find out and go after them with federal warrants
noonan will figure out who and what hector was sooner or later
yes he will so we buy time keep him busy until when
until tom bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days ratifying the official start of construction on dodger stadium this is bigger than a fucking ballpark
hector magdalena and narco is the powder keg blows the whole department to hell
dont be dramatic it looks weak
right now noonan needs a pursuit so i supply him with one me
you want me to draw him off youve been drawing him off
and the more he sees you the less hell think of anything other than getting you
now find tommy and take him alive
do not let noonan get to him
as a potential major case witness against the lapd tommy magdalena isnt just a powder keg hes an atom bomb
watch him disappear down the hall
bradley has a bigger angle and im getting close to it
i just havent hit home
in a clean t shirt from my locker
heading toward juniors desk
all eyes on my wounds
i toss stemmons his shirt
seltzer will take the blood out
junior bitchy like some broad you stood up i give you the shirt off my back and you bash me
when a superior officer tells you to leave the room you leave the fucking room
junior balls the shirt stuffs it in his desk drawer
takes a deep breath
i made a file on the bledsoe broad
the one you asked about
but forget it
i spent a whole day putting it together and this skirts got skeletons
reminded glance at my hand a i n g e in smeared ink
junior rips open a file blathers bledsoe preliminaries shoplifting in bakersfield at
prostitution arrest at
known associate of a kern county homicide victim this convicted pimp named dwight gillette probably her pimp
stabbed to death in his home weapon never recovered forget it
burn it snot important now
take the file from him flip through thorough detailed
glenda priors scream back instant conviction
why is it not important
plant the file in his chest as my answer
i need an address on a guy named ainge george ainge what about magdalena
my temper turning threadbare
after you get the ainge address get back to the magda picks up glendas file is ainge related to this cunt
snap grit grab him buttons from his shirt pop bounce
were partners in name only
you want to stay in the room next time junior
do something to impress me like finding that address
dig junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad dog glare makes me want to break the bones in his face
driving running parallels to avoid fed tails
no black buicks
but a gray packard shifts behind me on a cadence
noonan replaced the buick with a packard and a better shadow man
but i could still spot the tail
run a red light at rossmore leave the packard behind
this jet engine urge to see her
needing it like a junkie does
just the push
driving past glendas house now
driving past the griffith park vampires set addicts crew rolling up sleeping bags
pull the address list dandy handed me talent domiciles
howards fuck pad supreme a tudor mansion with airplane shaped hedges
a corvette in the drive
stop at the curb
flashes of her
check my hamilton look up as knock knock on my window
her face inches close
bags of groceries in her hands and this wry little smile watch me kill hughess new dick with kindness
roll the window down stay blank slate
she features my cuts bruises
her quiet deep voice is like medicine better looking than the last guy howard hired
once you heal
she recognizes me wait a minute
you were there the other night the bethune party
my heart jammed up into my throat
push past it
mickey told me this bent cop everybody used to call mocking i love it the enforcer was asking about me
told me to be careful
so youre lapd after all
youre going to arrest me for breaking and entering
nod to groceries those howards
thats why i left
you just shop here now
some of our extras havent had a vegetable since truman
attack of the atomic vampires
smiles no flinch we cant all be audrey hepburn
plus it pays bills
better than a billionaire does
go make amends and finish out your service contract ms
not if there was just one day left on it
im better than that
youre also better than a starring role in schlock horror flick thatll never see a screen regardless if its leading lady gets kidnapped or not
drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag
shes beat but bluffs by
this isnt the first time youve spied on me
nor the second
beat well youve got me all giftwrapped enforcer dave
youre on hughes bad side ms
its not a bright place to be
so please go glenda
this smile just for me and tell howard ill take my chances with the fake vampires
and she twirls off gone
watch her go
my radio buzzes

paw the phone book
tear out the address for bido litos
dodging darktown altogether
holed up in hollywood
hiding in plain sight
back booth with a view of the street
bido litos across the way
eyeball the entrance and adjoining alley
on the table in front of me mugshots known tommy magdalena associates
mostly greaser kids with low rent juvie sheets
stare at that photo of tommy
match a face out front if i get lucky
wait till bido litos gets busy before i make my move
snub my last chesterfield stifle a yawn check my hamilton
bito crowd bops out front
spot a face
pull my mugshots
steve wenzel okie white trash from el monte shoving his way through the crush out in front of the club hits the side alley
dump a pocketful of coins on the table
hit the door
cross fast play the wall and the shadows close
watch as wenzel climbs steps to a flop overtop of the club
get deeper into the alley a padlocked two car overhang at the rear
stock down swing split the lock
chain spools at my feet slide inside the overhang
a car concealed under a tarpaulin peel it off slow
revealing a red ford
pull the pig sticker off my ankle stab the driver side tire
now hes on foot
jimmy the door slide inside silent
muffled sounds through the floor some jazz combo wailing away at bido litos below
voices down the hall male laughter goofball guffaws
george gobel on the tube well ill be a dirty bird
creep in a crouch my
at the hip safety off
move toward the flicker at the far end of the hall
sounds of pissing nearby ease around a doorjamb
first bedroom barren dust caked mattress a half dozen bottles of old crow lie scattered among sash cords used heroin spikes
light from the bathroom
a pair of legs visible female
dark but pale splayed from inside the bathroom
the right foot slowly moves back and forth like the heel is trying to gain some purchase on fast draining life
somebody flushes zips up steps over the two legs
duck back into the hall as this greaser stinking of pomade wafts past weaving back toward the tv room
move fast now
a fist sized lump swells mid chest blossoms into my throat
i dont want to see what i know is there
turn the corner club alabam songbird tilly hopwell
three breaths from death
a spike snapped off in her greyish motionless left arm
her right hand claws at tile
these beautiful dark eyes stare up at me like she was hoping for someone sooner
throttle marks on her neck one breast exposed bra pulled down for a grope
i dont want to touch her face but i do
she closes her eyes the moment my fingertips hit
that gases my hate
choke back sudden tears
greaser in the doorway brown bagged t bird hits the floor as he reaches for his waist stand and shoot him in the throat
into his sternum like a blade before i fire the second third fourth shots
he falls flails
jump shock from the other room
just pistol fire through the half rotted walls punks taking potshots
no compliance means i hit the hallway shooting back
firing dead bang at a couple fleeing silhouettes see them pop stumble fall the archway above my head shreds collapses
somebody firing a sub machine gun
flat on my ass my back finds the wall cough up plaster sleeve my eyes to see
then quiet save the rattle clap of changing clips
machine gun fire lights up my left side
taste floor grime as subsonic zips snap close
bullets miss by inches
every part of me pauses
back door gets blunted open frantic footfalls recede
that big bent v on tommys deuce roars to life
up now plow through the cloud of cordite
see one of tommys pachucos propped up against the wall unhit unhurt
and pull the trigger a i pass
hit an empty chamber
this punks lucky day
out the door reloading as the deuce barrels away
tommy fires shots into the air to clear traffic
wenzel in the passenger seat screams to do the same
the drivers side rim sparks fireworks
pandemonium out in front of bido litos as the crowd stampedes ass over elbows
sprint to my car inside key dispatch fast as i wheel rough off the curb shots fired block of ivar
suspect fleeing scene in red ford deuce travelling westbound on wilcox vehicle impaired intercept at hollywood blvd
horns blare as i slalom club goers scrambling across ivar
punch it over top sunset parallel to the deuce
rip a left on selma
stay on my radio and i need an ambulance to respond to north ivar second floor female negro possible overdose
up ahead i catch a fireworks show the deuce gouges pavement across the way
clip mph catching up
squeal onto wilcox as tommy hooks a right onto hollywood
two prowlers pass the next second sirens lit full scream
haul ass up to hollywood round it see tommy and wenzel sitting upright the deuce spun sidelong firing m grease guns into the approaching prowlers
both cars go helter skelter under fire
six packs spill to the street belly crawl brandish
service snubs and pop flimsy return fire
tommy jumps down runs rifling his jacket for clips
wenzel stays atop the car gun my engine split the abandoned prowlers
wenzel looks up mid reload as i t bone the deuce at speed
the impact rockets him rag doll end over end before he bombs back down to the street wet sack multiple bruises fractures breaks
blood pooling in pints
tommy wide eyes the heap that was wenzel
kick my drivers side door open firing
tommy cuts loose with that grease gun sprays wild
crouch move as bullets thump wreckage and whiz by overhead
more sirens approach
tuck behind the front end of the mangled deuce
another salvo from the grease gun skips up off the pavement in front of me
the six packs have regrouped start laying down fire on tommy
tommy running now im up on one knee aiming tucking into the
take his legs but dont kill h that gray packard materializes across the intersection in front of tommy shotgun blasts from the drivers side backseat obliterates tommys mid section
my mouth gapes at what just happened
then i remember to fire at the packard as it continues down the street running lights extinguished no plates visible
get to tommy
roll him on his back
wheres your father
did wilhite kill him
bubbling blood in place of words
mouth moves like a groupers
his last gasp
pray its profound
he breathes out
radiator steam from under my crunched hood
that gray packard not the feds
make them magdalena rivals
i left bido litos too fast to catch a tail
so where did they come from
pull up onto the front lawn
grab my brass knucks from the glove box
out of my car
a pair of narco brims wilhites boys break wide on my approach
junior stumbles from the stakeout car rushing up the street toward me
when i dont respond dave
madge this vacant glaze tear smudged mock mourning with more booze and pills
word of tommys demise has reached her
wheres dan wilhite
nothing from her
climb the steps two at a time
beeline lucilles room
shoulder the door off the jamb
wilhite and lucille in the middle of some close conversation
giant startle from both
he reeks of bad scotch
present him like exhibit a to lucille did he kill your piece a shit pimp dad
wilhite rips free
or was it that peeper across the street that jacks off to your sad little shows junior behind me
urgent dave please

her eyes shoot to wilhite
grab lucilles bruised arms
wilhite grabs me in return

bull rushed back into the hall by wilhites boys

hangmans bruise forming around my neck
junior and ainge gone
floorboards under ainges bed pried up
crawl to the hole a hiding spot empty of whatever was in it
call it the knife was here
ainge was crawling under his bed not to escape me but to hand it over
too hate wired to see it
i check my watch pm
junior the player
junior the underestimated
junior the former evidence teacher a murder weapon a witness a two hour head start
few looks from few neighbors
thank god gunshots and screams are school nights in this slum
get into my car
my glove box ripped open contents gone
junior the flush my down payment from hughes gone
junior the merciful he shouldve put a bullet in my brain
nobody around this late
only a desk sergeant on the doze
zero in on juniors desk search it files squared pencils in precise alignment evidence books arrayed alphabetically
everything inspection neat
no mail no personal items
eagle scout perfect
rip at a locked return jimmy the desk drawers feel the underside for a key zilch
slide under looking
sit up grab his phone dial out
meg wake up pete
rustling and whispers
take some pills will you
ill give you a grand to locate and tail junior stemmons
find a letter opener fuck it pry the drawer loose
the lock snaps
ease it open
tell me what he does who he talks to where he goes and if hes got this mutt named george ainge stashed somewhere
red steno pads
a small orderly pile
pull one thumb it blank
whats stemmons address
im working on it
hustle to my desk sit grab a reverse directory fake flip through it as fritz koenig and two robbery blueshirts arrive seizure bags over their shoulders
i clear sweat and leftover blood with my sleeve trying to look busy as koenig sidles up
nod to shoulder bag you moonlighting
doing some ad hoc dope seizures for dan wilhite
that shark grin still love taking the occasional door down
you were born for the street fritz
i never featured you for the suit and tie set
were of a common bloodline boy o
whered you get that haul
dropping bag some reformed spic dope dealers that normally dabble in reefer
koenig his knuckles and fingernails caked with blood pulls a three pound brick of heroin from the bag
seized from chavez ravine
the city is cracking down on the dreaded to make room for their beloved dodgers
they remove the mexicans we remove the rest
scramble a joke to keep koenig from looking at me too closely
they could hawk heroin right along with peanuts and hot dogs
have the whole bleacher section goofing on horse
koenig laughs big re shoulders the bag
a new found dedication these days
whats prompting such odd hours
playing catch up
the boy chief seems to be running both of us ragged
he currying favor with chief parker with this chavez ravine sweep
parker appreciates bradleys political skills
and the addition of a professional ball club to our fare city fulfills his own personal mandate of a cleaner brighter la
stale milk to me too
and how are you faring
is our visiting u
attorney still in hot pursuit
let him see it in my face humorless and half lit
borrowed time fritz
anything i can do
a small favor
beat stemmons home address if you have it
hes in a bit of a bind
beat bigger than your own
a lot bigger
drop loose change
pete picks up on the first ring
did you want me to clip stemmons
by now hes stashed ainge so hes travelling solo
whos this ainge clown anyway
oh milteer wants a progress report on the movie broad bledsoe hang up
roll to my car
pull in plop the dishrag loaded with ice on the front seat
blood still seeping slick it back in my hair
step from the car woozy weaving the goose egg on my head feels like a hand grenade
up the front walk lean on the doorbell
she answers silk chemise barring tan shoulders her hair swept up a long perfect neck
if she just woke up she doesnt look it
i could say something witty about gentleman callers at this hour covered in blood but no time to trade repartee
out with it george ainge
she goes rigid clutches her robe
is that his
off my nod yes is he dead
but i know about dwight gillette and the knife youre trying to barter back
all of it
like i punched her in the mouth
her face embarrassment cut with confusion
she recovers quick steels herself
then why are you here
yshould be picking up a paycheck from hughes
im not watching you for him anymore
beat if youre planning on shaking me down for favors go pick up your paycheck mr
or are you being a policeman right now
the good ones are called policemen
the bad ones are called cops
im a cop
she steps closer
i can smell her
another cop has this information on you
he has the murder weapon too
he might use it against you before i can stop him
can you go somewhere
youre protecting me
you dont even know me
just the parts you wish i didnt
the place in topanga canyon where your going to hole up for the kidnapping thing
is it safe
she nods drifts somewhere a part of her life thought dead threatening everything again
get your coat
i want to pull her closer
we wind along topanga canyon
constant mirror checks looking for packards buicks ghosts
i roll my window up
light jazz on the radio gives way to the news kgfj news at the top of the hour
attorney welles noonan today announced his intention to probe what he called widespread corruption within the los angeles police department and promised an equally widespread round of criminal indictments before
click it off
she notices says nothing
after another half mile she points to a side road topanga cyn rd on the mailbox
i pull in
a gravel drive gives way to a bungalow tucked into the trees
did ainge know about this place
i didnt want to tell him till after
put the car into park
she looks over her eyes asking something
i hold her gaze hesitate then nothings going to happen to you
she frets with her hair her eyes glassy
i dont know that
im not gonna let it
i want to grab her and kiss her
i convince myself otherwise grab a card from my coat and a pen scrawl
this is my sisters number
name is meg
call if there are problems
hand her the card
so does she
slowly being squeezed on all sides
looking for leverage
figure out bradleys angle before i fry
madge and lucille in custody
no hector and no tommy equals no leads
slouched in my front seat watching a small flop style motel near the beach
beat dispatch shot me his temporary address
some beach flop he fled to after his wife put him out
check my hamilton am
a car pulls into the parking lot
two suits step out ramrod straight starched officious process servers if ever ive seen them
one of them bears a sealed envelope as they walk to room and knock
they knock rude
i roll down my window
dan wilhite answers in a robe groggy pissed hungover
before he utters a word hes handed the sealed envelope and the pair depart
wilhite calls after tearing open the envelope and reading whats inside
then rereading it
gauge his reaction ruined
he puts his hand on top of his head
like hes trying to protect it from the sky that is now falling down around him
another big pause staring at nothing
then he just calmly walks back inside the room closing the door behind him
out of my car
quietly hustling up to wilhites door reach it and hear a distinct pop see the flash snap from behind the curtains gunshot
i know what it is
hit the door
wilhites service revolver a foot away from one hand a sheet of paper still gripped in the other
body half onto the bed half off
blood drains from a round wound in his temple
check behind me nobody coming close the hotel door
pick up the sheet of paper contents of the envelope
the first word i see subpoena
my first thought pure panic noonan figured the narco magalena connection
flip the subpoena over to see his signature not noonans
this subpoena has been issued and signed by la district attorney bob gallaudet
flip it back over wide eyed but it wasnt a federal subpoena
wilhite was being called to testify by bob gallaudet a man who doesnt piss without bradleys say so
beat bradley trying to beat noonan to the punch and burn the lapd himself
a quick check of the lot
a housekeeping cart sits nearby
swipe a bottle of bleach from it
walk to wilhites studebaker powerhawk
pop the trunk return to his room
firemans carry dump wilhites body in the trunk
toss his service
pour the bottle of bleach to stanch the inevitable rot smell
swap my car for wilhites
the former head of the lapds narcotics division dead in the trunk
call it the leverage i was looking for his body can buy me out of bad spot and thats when i see it a bandage poking out from under wilhites
undo a couple buttons lift the bandage
bam me hit from behind by the peeper
bam me firing at the peeper
hit him in the left shoulder
bam grabbing wilhites shoulder in the magdalena bathroom him howling in pain
the kind of wound a grazed bullet leaves
wilhite was the peeper
bent on lucille a girl younger than his youngest daughter
call it grounds for divorce
call wilhite hector magdalenas murderer
slam the trunk as wilhites glazed eyes stare back at me
slow cruise new ride means no tails
check my mirrors anyway
back to the pad back streets all the way
rounding the corner break hard those same process servers leaning on my doorbell now
bradley trying to bury me too
that subpoena means my fifteen year career with the lapd just went up in smoke
those process geeks keep buzzing my doorbell
hey juniors left the fucking planet
you find him
i swung by his apartment car was out front
i scoped it a sawed off shotgun in front canned tuna in the back seat
think hes living outta that car
after he left i tried to get inside his place the front door is triple pad locked
out loud that knife is in there the what
ignore it maybe pete will too
meet me down the street from his place
you got bolt cutters
ill bring em
juniors stucco beige apartment building looms a block up
cursory checks of the rear and side view mirrors
sans tail as i pull the powerhawk in behind petes caddy
step out sidle up drivers side
whos car is that
junior looked real skeezed this morning
like he was on a dope jag
sweated up like a stuck pig
and be careful
he was fucking around with his front door before he left
i dont know what he was doing
two honks if he shows
then meet me in the alley back of his place
handing me bolt cutters what about this bledsoe broad
milteer has called me twice
taking the bolt cutters one thing at a time pal
hustle across the street
hang my badge over my shirt pocket
up three flights
junior three padlocks hinge receiver hardware extending between door and jamb
three kicks and a shoulder to splinter the door
stop look some kind of twine stretched taut just inside the door
pull my pig sticker extend it between door and jamb
see the twine stretching tighter flick the blade snag twine slice it
put my boot into the door full
snaps at the hinges
examine close eye bolt pulley system jerry rigged around the door
severed twine attached to the trigger of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level
continue to look around
sex horror grimace like catching pop fingering mom
juniors place a tiny filthy one bedroom
junior the insane you couldnt hide what he was hiding in la and not have it rot your mind
bear traps barely hidden under sheets
rat traps garnished with razor blades across the floor
smell rotten flowers his shirt that i wore bled on crumpled on his pillow yellowed jizz stains cover black blood stains
stifle a gag
card table an empty green banded evidence bag
gape at it
then walk over read the abstracts south tremaine
junior stealing evidence from the magdalena crime scene
then i see the bookcase
top shelf police manuals
bottom two shelves wall to wall red steno pads all exactly the same brand
flip through them tiny architect neat script covers every page
the running dialogue of a functional fucking freak a hand drawn cock doodled beneath that then below drop the steno like it might bite
pick up another same drill
pick up yet another hands shaking turn to the last page junior the climber trading me up to noonan
thinks bootlicking will buy him a bureau gig
now rifle for that knife
systemically destroy the place
dump the stenos in a trash can sift for matches strike watch the pads catch and floosh feed the fire with random paperwork sift juniors cock obsessed doodles scribbled by
under the bed now carpet covered in rat traps
spring them clear a space
a box beefcake booty gay smut mags gay classified ads
first person perspective polaroids of juniors stomach being kissed by the diskant quiff and vice versa
open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall
arsenal handguns shotguns a surplus m
dump it kick contents
only interested in that knife
move into his kitchenette
check the freezer even though junior is smarter than that amyl nitrate poppers vodka benzedrine cocaine
stop indents in the cheap tile floor from where the refrigerator used to sit
pull to see whats behind
eyes catch the bear trap near the bed as i tug ugly rusted waiting
stop part ii contort peer behind the refrigerator a pineapple shaped hand grenade duct taped to the wall next to a built in safe
the safe scared me more than all of it because a safe doesnt get installed overnight
hed been working on something planning something
twine leads from the grenades pin to the back of the refrigerator
my bolt cutters snap it
pull the refrigerator out now
the safe bolted into the drywall
stare at it the dial the black paint job
loading shells into the shotgun that was atop that jello mold
back into the kitchen
reload fast nothing can muffle this clatter
eyes closed to keep chunks of drywall out
gagging on gunsmoke
rip at the safe something gives
the safe hits the floor leaves a hole
through the ringing in my ears something that sounds like honks
quick peek pete gone
a black buick with two white walled feds up front
then junior gets out of the backseat
scoop the freezer drugs the stack of man porn the snapshots and toss a whole armful into the hallway in front of juniors door
grab the green banded evidence bag and tuck it under my arm
back into the kitchenette
turn on the gas but dont light the burners
pull the grenade off the wall
drag the safe to the rear of his place the fire escape
out the window on the escape toss the evidence bag down to pete then push the safe over the railing
feature it almost crush the back of petes idling cadillac
pete jumps yells asshole
get it open if you can and meet me back at megs
doesnt move until i pull the pin on the pineapple drop the pin down on him
he jumps back in peels off junior on the second floor landing heading to his place
bloodshot bleary wide eyes spun on a combo of drugs the feds herding him like a rabid dog stay right here
ill get it all and come back
ricochet the grenade back into the kitchen
leap down half a flight put exterior brick between my head and the big boom the grenade goes off
junior knocked on his ass halfway up the last flight
feds come sprinting
screaming junior tackles one on the way up
juniors front door blown off
terrified neighbors greeted with images of sodom scattered from the explosion drugs mags dildos
the fed that didnt get tackled picks up a photo junior kissing a hairy stomach
and juniors mind snaps cleanly in half
crawls away growling like a bear caught in one of his traps
i step calm
clear the alley slow
dont let your stride give you away
another black buick arrives
more bureau stiffs
looky loos pop up along the block pointing
im the only one not looking back toward juniors now flaming pad
the powerhawk still another street up
fire engines wail close
shouts from behind now
look back a bureau putz pointing my way one of the buicks tearing up the block toward me
keep going and give up wilhites car and the corpse inside or lay back and deal with noonans buzzcuts
lace my fingers behind my head turn to face them catch a form tackle from this geeked up junior g man diving from the buick drives his shoulder and takes
me down sprawling
welles noonan staring
he picks nipped mutilated fingernails
civil servants cant afford manicures
breaking and entering theft and willful destruction of private property
and ill add attempted murder to the current first degree murder charge im about to file against you
if you had it you wouldnt be fucking around with shitty shakedown routine youd file
coercion equals confession
so lets see you pound it out of me
where are the files you stole from sergeant richard stemmons

gulp the coffee back the burn feels good

nod to agreement i get a copy of that
after a judge signs it
stand nod take my coffee leave
noonan shreds the witness agreement
tosses it in the trash
off the baffled deputy
we wait for him to deliver then we arrest him
you never saw that agreement
let him get comfortable
let him believe me
suborned cabby driving fast
lapd on board
running out of room time both
trapped between bradley and noonan
jump out of the cab into wilhites powerhawk
slide in slam the door
bust in shaking
teeth chatter like im freezing
pete in the garage adjacent the kitchen welders goggles and a power drill punching holes in juniors safe
i know what feds look like those were feds with junior
yeah and they made me leaving the scene
had to barter out
i signed a federal witness agreement
pete drops the drill
noonans got no intention of honoring it
beat they want stemmons files though
i think juniors been working angles for awhile doing his own investigations
what did you do to his place
nice quiet neighborhood one minute nagasaki the next
point to safe he had a hand grenade tied to that
as pete resumes drilling how much longer do you need
few more hours
junior didnt skimp on this thing
i gotta bore right through the face plate
beat you got some time now why dont you get milteer off my back and go work that bledsoe broad
you read my mind
glendas vette parked behind
lights on low inside
the door opens
shes dressed for bed
i dont hesitate afraid shell shun me
move to her she doesnt startle
an arm around her waist drawing her in my mouth close to hers
i take her face in my hand check her eyes a beat before they tell me its okay
i lean in takes a lifetime
and kiss her soft until she kisses back her mouth moving over my split lips she puts her hands on my face pulling me in
she feels exactly like i imagined
my coat comes off
her camisole follows
were moving toward a bed in back
i stop pull back the moonlight moves over her shoulders
i whisper tell me if im being too rough
tears squeezed through smiling eyes she kisses me even harder pulls me down to her
we make love like weve never touched another
everything blurs burns down bradley
she takes it all away
i escape into her
i could stay here forever
lying there staring at her
a silence and peace ive never known
tell me anything
tell me everything
label her surprise her brow that furrows and unfurrows just as quickly
a long moment as she waivers
commits where would i start
this amazing smile why is anybody here
want the rest of the world to know who they are
i dont think so
beat i just love it
i grew up in seattle
my aunt every week shed take me to the movies
me watching her
tucks her hair back over his shoulders
the idea that you can outlive yourself
that a part of you goes on long after youre gone
beat grins sounds silly doesnt it
attack of the atomic vampires being your ticket to immortality
make her laugh
swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her
he face slowly goes dark
hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago
movie with gregory peck at universal
he thought he was humoring me
until i got it
they offered me the role
there in the room
so howard who im sure never thought in a million years id land that part makes some phone calls and just like that they dont want me anymore
beat nobody calls now
i cant get in to see any studio casting people
hes ruined me in those circles
and you still want it bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god awful dialogue sound decent
surrounded by winos in werewolf suits
she laughs i laugh thats
depends on the day
the laughter ebbs her eyes still shine
ill get there though
beat ill get there
i let the silence take
try not to shatter it with dwight gillette
she doesnt blanch
he asked me to take his niece and nephew to their cousin in oxnard
these beautiful funny little kids
tears she doesnt swipe i dropped them off
didnt ask any questions i believed dwight
a week later i saw their pictures in the post office
a week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near san pedro
beat tears stream ill never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought i was part of it
that i knew what was going to happen to them
so i pray to god that he let them look in when i put that knife into dwight
beat but ill never ask his forgiveness for doing it
beat clears her eyes why do they call you enforcer
she actually gets closer i can feel her breath on me
ive killed men
she blanches but never blinks
never takes her eyes away from mine
for profit mostly
why did you sign with hughes knowing what he was
for profit mostly
a feeling like and there we are
im not much good
she touches my quake
two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet the shakes the images the fear
she takes my head pulls me to her bare breasts
the only things audible my breathing a clock ticking
both slowly fade out
wake up quiet look at my hamilton
sit up slow
look back at her sleeping just stare
i lean down kiss her lightly her taste lingers inhale her hold that
its the last good thing youll get today
maneuver into the kitchen
turn on a light
on the table safe open its contents laid out neatly short stacks of files in twenties
i sit start searching for something else
petes voice behind me the knife aint there
file on top of that middle pile george ainge in an undisclosed locale
i dont turn
pete sits next to me
sets a shotgun down
junior documented everything like a fucking monk
pulls a file like here has evidence you murdered sanderline johnson
pete contd kept track of suspected contract killings you pulled for the mob
look at pete
dark rings deathbed eyes
you been up all night
in case stemmons made a house call
hes got every goddamn address of everybody you know
beat hard and you shouldve told me about the bledsoe broad
theres nothing to tell
feature pete righteously pissed then call milteer about this dead pimp gillette
im no legal mind like you but ill bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick
beat hands phone collect the rest of your money
i dont want it anymore
then give that five grand back
junior stole it
pete pauses scoffs turns back toward megs bedroom walks people are gonna start lining up to see you bleed pal
i flip through juniors files the same architect neat block printing
find a glenda entry subsequent to her fatal stabbing of dwight gillette miss bledsoe
grab another file
hyper detailed subscript clarifications attachments pictures procedural notes to the u
united states attorney welles noonan
then i see the tab of the file furthest down boyce bradley
open it noonans business card stapled to the front cover
see bradleys name finger tracks across a page
a company name hurwitz holdings i read it all
and feel my jaw slowly unhinge
barrel down the hallway toward bradleys office
a habitual eye toward juniors desk koenig going through his drawers
veer toward him
formal frosty your young partner called me at my home early this morning
let koenig talk
speaking inarticulately of betrayal how the lapd was set to be blitzed by justice
is this the bind of which we spoke earlier
and his apartment there was some type of disturbance
thats why i needed his address
i was trying to help him before something like this happened
the kid snapped in half fritz
hes literally lost it
beat deadpan he say anything else to you
koenig looks back at me
give nothing away
one gesture that doesnt read right and hell know
he lets more seconds pass than he should
trying to shake me
only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage chief bradley
like i said fritz hes flipped his lid
i dont want to go to internal affairs but im afraid junior mightve forced just that
let me try to locate the lad first dave
be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon
be careful fritz
spin press on toward bradleys office
fritz koenig the best inspector in the lapd digging
hell find junior and when he does hell find ainge
reach bradleys office burst in
to his secretary where is he
frowns at my informality out at the ravine lieutenant
park the powerhawk
check my hamilton pm
noonans deadline lapsed ten minutes ago
an official fugitive from justice now
down below bradley with reuben ruiz in tow glazed fear following him like hes handcuffed
protestors gather placards hoisted chants dodgers no
the group gathers steam supporters pack in the chorus continues dodgers no
bradley doing damage control the forced relocation of the ravines immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy
reuben ruiz forced along as the token mexican mouthpiece
bradley handles them with ease and aplomb
this area has long been rife with crime and venality but with a brand new stadium we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our los angeles
dodgers the home they deserve
like ruiz was an orphan reuben ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to redeem the ravine
chief bradley u
attorney noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the federal grand jury on bradley this brilliant rebuke welles noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us
will fail for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the los angeles police department
then bradley sees me
his press friendly face contorts the shift startling if only a flashbulb couldve framed it
he shifts back from snarl to smile
now if youll excuse me ill leave you with reuben ruiz
ruiz begins his forced coerced do it or well fuck you sob story as bradley steps away from the glare
get right on his heels
your subpoena hasnt caught up to me yet chief
bradley spins back
hand him juniors file hurwitz holdings
bradley blanches buckles
i see it
before he can play stupid with what
you bethune and gallaudet bought big chunks of chavez ravine over the past two years through a shell company called hurwitz holdings
beat look around if the dodgers move here the value of the land booms
you could sell it off for a fortune or hang onto it and make even more
the parking lots alone would make you all multi millionaires
bradley removes his glasses staring at documentation that dooms both his immediate and distant future
word gets out that the three city officials who were pushing hardest for a stadium also stood to gain a mint might color public opinion
might color it even more to know that the lapds chief of detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town
slap another file over the one hes reading
hector magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land
beat ram him you didnt give a shit about solving his disappearance
you were worried that your real estate deal was going south
me contd thats why you wanted tommy found not because he was a murder suspect or you were concerned that noonan might tap him as a federal witness
you needed him to finalize your fucking land grab
to sign paperwork in place of his dead dad
thats why youve got madge and lucille in custody now
beat maybe ill let your subpoena find me now chief maybe ill walk right into it
the tales i could tell
all bradley can muster is how
the ex evidence teacher
his excellent ratings didnt stop him from stealing the magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation
why would he investigate me
hand him noonans business card dig the big federal eagle in american blue
that was stapled to the cover
beat why would noonan worry about a turd like me now
when a high profile target like you can be taken down
i smile wide at it
where is stemmons
if you havent spoken to internal affairs today im sure theyve called
juniors apartment caught fire
deeply deviant material inside
round him up my angle and anyone hes got with him
bradley readjusts his glasses
ill issue an a
saying stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children
now quid pro quo
you subpoenaed wilhite too
bradleys reaction feature the angler getting angled
how do y dont worry how
bradley says nothing
then like a klieg light it hits me
youre going after narco yourself
exposing the corrupt parts of the lapd will redeem the whole
ill prove that police can police themselves so you show up noonan
co opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can
jesus christ can you turn lemons to lemonade
no cop will testify against other cops
this is why wilhite has suddenly disappeared
beat so where do we go now chief
beat eyes flick again to the files im holding
there are other forces at work here
faces we need to identify
names we need to know
a third party
bradley contd find out who klein and ill reinstate you rescind that subpoena burn the coroners report on sanderline that report is only useful to noonan now
it ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that stemmons file
which i know you wont do until you figure out how it will best benefit you
he walks off imperious impervious gets engulfed by the press ranks once again
a mistake to underestimate me now chief
the price to keep your secrets is steep
and youre going to pay up
back to the powerhawk fresh scrubbed six packs standing near it the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment
they see me deferential nods
one squeaky wheel offers something in your trunk smells to high hell lieutenant
easily amused academy types
brush by grinning give em an enforcer story to tell the other rookies
i jump in the powerhawk and tear off
borrowed time burning fast
my days are done
only hours remain
whatever moves i have left
make them now
going through files
filling my own steno pad with scrawl
pete walks in from the garage face bunched up bit lemon
you cant keep that car in the garage the smells coming into the house
meg wanders in dressed for work
open the windows
thats not gonna help
still scribbling take a couple bottles of bleach pour it over the trunk
what do you got in there
my foreseeable future
im going to work
she kisses me on my head
i turn you taking her
god damn glowering im taking her
meg walks out
im starting to sour him
i look up
this is almost over pete ill give milteer the five grand back
its more than that
ill square it
its my thing
that you made mine
pete sketches me head to toe
look as bad as ive ever seen you
things are as bad as theyve ever been
i keep scribbling
bradleys third party theory
everything linked wilhite magdalena the ravine
ive got my own theories
and the one that sticks is the one i pray im wrong about
megs phone blares i answer it on reflex
i hear rasp on the other end hyperventilating unhinged
motherfucker you better meet me
that cooze you threw everything away for is still cooked
i got the knife
i got ainge junior
howd you get this number junior
i got everything on you
and im youre a broom closet queer
your career is over
the knife for my file on bradley
i know you already burned that whores but dont think i cant re do investigations
you snitch to noonan then what
i got stronger allies
meet me in one hour with that file fern dell park where you used to snag fruits for vice
a volunteer gig im guessing
be there with bradleys file or i scratch your scabby bitch
hey did the feds dig your pad
the phone on the other end seems to break in half
hang up it rings a beat later
junior still wanting to spar
snag the receiver rip his shit i see anybody near there junior the deals off and i gift that file to bradley to fuck you with dave
big beat glenda
hes got her
my mind cannibalizes itself with where is she how do i get her back when sorry
you gave me this number
he doesnt have her
a sigh so big it steals all my air
who were you talking no no
i had a phone call just before yours
glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking the canyon
she sits up
was it him
the cop you were telling me about
i dont want you to worry
im handling it
but i might send my friend pete out there
you dont think its safe
id just rather have someone there with you
i wish you wouldve woken me up this morning
im better looking in low light i didnt want to blow it for myself
makes me smile despite my world caving in
stay by the phone
i miss you
and i melt
love struck at possibly the worst fucking moment of my life
hang up before your voice breaks
grab a pen scrawl for pete post it on the fridge magnet pete
half dirt half asphalt path
i scan for any back up
junior already there
astride like gary cooper
his eyes bloodshot from here
my gun riding quick draw style
the heft feels good
unbutton my coat to show him the file as i approach tucked right behind my
wheres the knife
junior this evil little curl
follow him over a small knoll that gray packard waiting
a silhouette behind the wheel
as we near it the lights come on blind me
turn your lights off
and just come out and talk to me
a pause in the car junior looks at me like im rasputin divining answers from the marine layer moving in over la
the lights pop off and i hear a tired laugh coming from the car that weve all heard before
third party confirmed
i fucking knew it
fritz koenig steps out of the packard
not much with these sub rosa things
a nod to the packard i thought it was noonan tailing me
bradleys greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side
junior jumpy in my periphery
i dont like it
wilhite ran magdalena for you not narco
when did you know
i had a feeling
i smelled cover up all over hectors disappearance and wilhite wouldnt have the muscle or the mind set to kingpin something that big by himself
you knew about bradley trying to buy him out
he was offering to exonerate hector and clear his criminal record
hector met with wilhite and i to inform us of his decision
for the first and only time we see hector magdalena alive and well
for the moment
speaking to koenig and wilhite
to accept bradleys deal
koenig pets hectors twin doberman guard dogs
and although the terms of that deal worked well for him
i found them less than favorable
koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before shooting a shocked hector twice in the chest
wilhite staggers to his feet as koenig steps over and delivers the coup de grace head shot to hector
hot spots for human vice
these are slums i run profit from
if these slums suddenly become stadiums that profit goes elsewhere
that crime goes elsewhere
you two got greed in common
junior keeps shifting
dying to shoot him dead
you knew about wilhite and lucille
thats how you were operating him
i was aware of his sexual predilections
a scowl for junior and someone elses
that great white grin we share an eye for human frailty and were both born blackmailers dave
beat i knew young stemmons here had a fondness for lads stretching back to his days at the academy
and now youre his only ally
back at junior this sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the feds
back to koenig so you get this file to battle bradley with
whats junior get in return
and like he was waiting for those words junior lunges
i twist to deflect but hes too fast feel something sink and drag in my side
i go down gouge groping for my gun
instant trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm fingers failing
then a pain like boiling oil moves through my blood
look down see a mother of pearl knife hilt in my side the business end stuck deep
junior laughing as i fall to my knees
he pulls the file from the waist and tosses my
two inches from my face koenig takes the file opening it
turning his back i dont want to watch
im sorry it came to this dave
junior his own
pulled put to my head
i hope the bledsoe whore was worth it
cuz shes still fucked
for a crooked cop you think small
koenig reads the files first page lifts it
a blank page behind
and behind that one
whatever moves i had left
i just made
koenig spins back more blank pages spilling from the file
this isnt it
junior looks thats all i need
pull the pig sticker off my ankle and corkscrew it into his calf twisting
junior bleats slaughtered lamb as i reach up a wrench his gun free
grab his tie pull him down as i jut his gun up under his chin and fire two shots through the top of his head
haul him down dead by his tie turn koenigs gun hand flashes to his shoulder
shoot him twice
he goes down gargling fuck
stand up on me sea legs bad wobble weave as i slowly pull the knife from my side pocket it
feel blood flow saturate my pant leg
this weird wooze overcomes me as i approach koenig
he pulls himself into a sitting position shaking his head
this bemused beaten half grin as he flicks blood from his hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky
poorly played dave
my intention crystal clear endgame
koenig looks up this odd squint like a bum about to beg for change
could i talk you into something
cut you in on something
give him no hope
wont work for me fritz
he nods remorse resignation
it at all looks the same now
give me a minute then
watch his hands as he removes his shoes waiting for an ankle grab his back up piece
he sets his shoes aside gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this short gruff laugh
some inside joke that will die untold
with a nod okay
and he holds his last breath and seems completely content as i shoot him
cross to junior now rifle his clothes retrieve a hotel key room read it motel commodore centinela ave
inglewood ca george ainge sweating on a stained bedsheet smoking reefer goofing on a tv test pattern randomly pulling at his dick
walk by his window he sees me recognition kinks thinks this is a good sign
i shoot him right through the glass
bradley roused from sleep silk robe coming down the stairs his back door wide open
reaches the landing turns on the light
feature me this bobble eyed ghoul bloodying his settee
i look like something exhumed
his monogrammed serving napkins soak up blood from my knifed side
he startles school girl
throw the file at his feet marred mangled stained
he inches forward cinching his robe
going pale where
along with wilhite junior
and hector magdalena
why are you here
i have the things you need to destroy noonans play
these same things can be used to destroy you
bradley prim proper even this early
he sits down across from me like some fucking duke
and wilhites body
he committed suicide after you subpoenaed him
this body is in your possession
and its what you need to burn narco to the ground
but if those files and his body were to be given to noonan and the feds with me providing the cherry on top testimony of a rogue cop
the word cataclysmic comes to mind
what will this cost
a percentage of your dodger stadium stake in perpetuity
you buy my silence for a fourth of hurwitz holdings
bradley scoffs pithy smile
whatd you expect
a stick up
empty your safe
im about to disappear for good and youre gonna fund my new life
you cant counter punch out of this
arrest me and i snitch the world
point to the file ill hold that over your head for the rest of your life
renege on our deal and it wont matter if its tomorrow or ten years from now
ill fry you with that file
at my cracked hamilton im officially outta time now chief
bradley an actual full blown facial tic
his adams apple bobs as he realizes that hes finally been beaten
cruising up the topanga canyon
shaking to see her touch her
pete opens up
a pissed off nod
liquor wafts off of him
you go to bed drunk or just been up all night
no answer as i follow him into the house
wheres glenda is she asle
round the corner glenda shaking but refusing to cry
i go pale what is this
somebody to the left look milteer
look back at pete tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with a right cross
seen pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought god help me if he ever hits me like that
instant drop moan
dont kill me
pete looks to milteer wipes blurred eyes
the harder you hit him the quicker i say stop and cease that absurd crying
pete bludgeons me
i try to get closer to glenda
feel my nose shatter
another swing right cheek detonates
a left hook to take advantage of my momentum left eye explodes
glendas crying screaming gets me madder than anything
at milteer touch me and he dies
pete knocks me down again
my face in pieces
kick him kick him kick him
pete hesitates puts his boot into my guts prim official you may stop
beat for the room howard determined that this was the price for your time together
milteer produces a polaroid takes a snapshot of my shattered husk hands the camera to pete on his way out
you still have a job
i spit volumes of blood
ill talk with a slur for the next year
pete reaches for me blotto sobbing
im sorry dave
pushing out words past shattered teeth
i put you here
that powerhawk theres a body in the trunk burn it
big drunk nod from pete
glenda panicking trying to stanch blood that keeps rushing
pete reeling drunk leans down stuffs something in my jacket
im so sorry
i sit in the tub let the shower rain down
drain floods diluted red
wash my wounds my soul
so many bruises i look bubonic
my face still swelling already purple black
my left eye more than swollen shut
on the other side of the curtain glenda naked
beauty that catches in my chest
try to stand turn my destroyed face
she gently pushes me back down
sits into me holds my face in both hands so that the water hits my lips
no nerves no unease
she closes the curtain
both wide awake
let me take you to a hospital
wed never make it inside
big beat im worried
im through the worst of it
she frames my face with her hands
i dont believe you
lies will only leak expose
the silence makes me just as guilty
she lets me off the hook her head on my arm leaning in
i kiss her
at a whisper was i worth this
whatever the cost
just like that then
just like that
another kiss the last one ill remember
you clearly see what my face will look like years hence
gauze over my left eye
reading the paper my dress blue photo the one that looks nothing like me now
headline lapd officer wanted in connection with recent rash of murders
attorney welles noonan issued a nationwide warning to law enforcement
my deadline with noonan two days old
he and bradley playing chess by press release
contd bradley relocates the deaths of captain fritz koenig and sergeant richard stemmons to chavez ravine
both given posthumous medals of valor
junior dies a hero after all
bradley professorial in glasses and pinstripes mid press conference
watch him work
a statesmans guile
cop killings clear the way for bradleys redeem the ravine mandate
dodger stadium construction moves forward
beat captain dan wilhite and hector magdalena
bradleys press fodder cast them as outlaw cop and drug dealer who most likely fled to mexico
narco under a full blown bradley led investigation
police unit run amok whos long tradition of graft does not extend to other divisions of the lapd
just sit and watch glenda
listen to her sleep rhythmic breathing
the little natural smiling curl to her lips
blonde hair splayed over white sheets
i havent loved you long enough to leave it all behind
too many enemies
too many ways for you to get hurt
too close to me
a decision that will haunt me the rest of my days
the gillette knife fold it in a kerchief gift wrap it to glenda
place a letter under it on the night stand my heaven the hours i had with you
my hell the years ahead without
someday ill see you before you even know im looking
i stand quiet grief the best word but still not enough
choke back tears as i lift petes camera and take the black and white picture youve seen before
put my jacket on pull the paper out of my pocket that pete planted
a twa airline voucher
i smile small
be nice to be in with a billionaire whos got a fleet of planes fly you outta the country on short notice
a times vending machine paper blazing with front page photos of wanted cop dave klein
i walk right past my old face
past cops and feds camped out looking for me
petes penance beating built me a brand new face
nobody gives me a second glance
not even the cops i recognize
up to the twa counter glance up at the departures board legend recife brazil im old
stare at my leather tan once broken face in a gilded mirror
the breaks occurred a lifetime ago healed uneven
i start to pack my suitcases
old files you think you may have seen before
an old gun you know youve seen before
movements slow and steady in my advancing age
my will to remember
my confession complete
still not enough
beat post scripts
contd me gringo exile rich off funds from stadium parking lots
meg and pete still married
boyce bradley lt

put her photo in my chest pocket
push the week old times into a waste basket a pan am ticket to la underneath
and it asked me to revoke our time apart redeem it
tell her anything

i stand shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long
and as i step out an old man twenty five years too late and my mgm handsome face smiles back at me through the shards
