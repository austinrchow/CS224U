burns based on the book by kurt eichenwald moving across the screen from right to left
we hear a happy and informative mans voice
we will come to know this voice as mark whitacres
you know that orange juice you have every morning
you know whats in that
freeze on one of the green gold streaks as it racks into to focus
we have been dollying through
hold on a single stalk of corn in the center of frame
and we are off again dollying past the green gold streaks of r and you know whats in the maple syrup you put on your pancakes
you know what makes it taste so good
again the dolly is on the move the corn plants strobe past
when you get grass stains on your good pants you know why the detergent mom uses can get them clean again
a huge combine enters frame and turns down a row
the camera follows it
we are in the middle of a massive corn field in southern illinois
the wind creates swells in the corn like a great green and gold sea
the farm equipment accelerates as does whitacre
theres corn syrup in the capsules you takes for your allergies com starch in my beer even corn oil in the paint were putting on the barn
corn flies through the air and into the collecting bin
bacon and eggs is really just corn and corn when you think about what they feed the chickens and the pigs
and when youre good and help with the trash you know what makes the big green bags biodegradeable
we reach the end of a row
the combine turns to harvest another row revealing
a porsche speeding down us highway
whitacre drives his young son alexander to school
whitacre is as happy as god makes creatures
alexander sips his half pint carton of orange juice
alexander hazards a guess
but daddys company didnt come up with that one dupont did
whitacre tussles his hair
they drive by a gas station in the middle of the cornfields
he continues his ode to corn in his head
ethanol is made of corn thats adm
but they also use it for scotch gin and vodka
corn and tonic
corn on the rocks
the car accelerates to pass a tanker truck with adm supermarket to the world emblazoned on the side
the is warped in the reflection
porsche or porsh a
ive heard it both ways
three years in germany i should know that
whats the german word for corn
the word i really like saying is kugelschreiber
thats pen all those syllables just for pen
whitacre signs in with the security gate at archer daniels midland headquarters in decatur
a sprawling industrial facility that makes most of what america eats
grain elevators cooling towers processing plants loading docks and a six story concrete bunker of an office building
he parks his car in a monogrammed space
whitacre walks across the open trading floor where soy and corn futures from around the world are displayed on a tote board and into his glass walled office
he has a kind word for everyone
smile flashing like a casino sign
he sees his pal kirk schmidt from accounting
hey there howdy
hey kirk we got to get out and hit some balls
whitacre scans the room full of busy co workers
his secretary liz taylor wears earrings that are ears of corn made of gold
what do they pay kirk
what does a guy like that get
i bet he gets a
hes just going to sit behind that desk and ride it into the future
they have lysine results
she hands him a folder
he opens it and scans the data
whitacre walks among the giant fermenters hes joined by a discouraged foreman
they check various gauges and dials showing proof of failure
we adjusted the dextrose again but the vrus keeps showing up thought we had it surrounded this time
were starting a new set of cultures
well vet it
we just gotta stay after it
the things eat sugar and thats what were giving them a warm place filled with sugar
they walk into a clean room full of flasks mechanically shaken like paint cans its too loud to speak
each flask is connected to a feed tube the cultures are administered to by a half dozen bio tech workers
he focuses on one worker shes asian
she adds some nutrients to the feed line
a positive mental attitude is a real important thing
theyve done studies where heart patients who have people praying for them actually do better than ones who dont
theres science for you
the cheerleaders might make a difference in the game after all
how do you know what the electrical energy of a thought actually does when its out there in the world
its gotta go somewhere
so you might as well smile
takes less muscles than frowning
whitacre closes the door on the very loud room
whitacre sits with mick andreas vice chairman and terry wilson president
an overhead projector displays the desultory performance of whitacres division
the fucking thing is supposed to produce thousand tons annually
were not gonna get anywhere near that
we got million dollars in costs over there guys
i can see the fucking thing from my swimming pool and it makes me want to drown myself every morning
did the japanese have these kind of problems with lysine
i dont give a shit about the japanese
you just gotta get the goddamn lysine bugs to eat the dextrose and shit us out some money
were still having problems with this virus
i dont want to hear about the damn virus anymore
terry what are we losing a month
were off like seven million per
thats not gonna fly much longer
you want to go in there next quarter and tell the board that were sucking hind tit on this
cuz i sure dont
he gives whitacre a cold hard were done fucking around glare
fix the goddamn plant or were gonna shut it down
the last light goes out
a pad of butter melts
whitacre stares at the ear
his wife ginger and alexander dine with him
ginger and mark have known each other since high school
she was homecoming queen then
either would be hard pressed to envision a life without each other
youre not hungry corky
whitacre is distracted
ginger cuts up alexanders food
the pilgrims loved the corn they came for the religious freedom but they stayed for the corn but its missing three of your eight essential amino acids especially lysine
thats why the indians ate it with beans or lime
you feed a chicken corn and it gets sick
yo feed it corn and lysine and it goes from egg to supermarket fryer in six months instead of eight
whitacre gazes over at a plate of fried chicken and then at his wife
she has gotten dressed up for dinner
she looks pretty
breasts and thighs in six months
you look great
they got the first wall of the stables up today
you see that
theyre doing this thing in hydroponics where theyre feeding lysine to jumbo shrimp
imagine youre a sh rimp and one day some corn goes floating by what do you think about that
i dont know what id think about that
theres an opening in mexico they might need me to go down there and get things set up
alex what do you think about mexico
i thought we were getting horses
whitacre is working late pouring over the failing lysine numbers
i would rather take a lot of pain killers in a
hotel room than jump off a bridge
or use a gun
a gun on your temple why do that
what does that say
pain killers definitely
lie down in a great big hotel bed whats that place in hong kong on the kowloon side
what a bed
if you think about it that doesnt mean anything its normal to think thoughts
his secretary liz taylor buzzes him on the intercom
on the intercom theres a call i cant pronounce his name he said he works for ajinomoto corporation
whitacre picks up
my name is fujiwara from ajinomoto corp
i want to discuss with you lysine if you have a moment
liz pokes her head into the office and mouths the words good night to her boss and leaves him alone with fujiwara
how you guys making out over there
whitacre on his way home from work this time in a jeep cherokee fills up the tank
a service station employee is changing the price of gasoline
another customer gives a sucker to her teething brat to pacify her
marty blocker used to sell us charms blow pops for three cents which was a great deal cuz at valley drug they cost a nickel
he said his dad worked for charms said he invented the blow pop and got a special deal like a life time supply
then they opened his locker
cuz of all the ants
in a line
his dad worked for the post office he came down to the school in his uniform
nothing ever happened to marty just ants
he blew off part of his thumb on the th of july with an m
at the next morning whitacre walks across the adm trading floor and straight into mick andreas office looking flustered
mick youre not going to believe what the hells happened
i think i know the reason why weve been having all these problems at the plant
well ive only been asking you to come up with one for the past eight weeks
im all ears
his story comes out in a rush of words
andreas listens silently
its not start up problems like we thought
its the japanese
this guy fujiwara from ajinomoto hes been calling me sometimes at work sometimes at home cuz of the time difference you met him he was here a couple of weeks
well last night he calls me at home just after and mick he knew everything
he says to me you remember the total nightmare you had during may june and july
and before i can ask him what he means he says those months when adm was losing about seven million dollars a month in the lysine business
whitacre stares at andreas in shock no one outside the company should know that
andreas is still stone faced
i couldnt believe it
but mick before i can even ask him how he got those numbers he starts making little comments about us having microbe problems
jokes like hes toying with me
whitacre is fuming now his voice unnaturally high
and then he tells me that one of our highest paid employees is actually an employee of ajinomoto and is sabotaging the plant
theyre injecting some kind of virus into the dextrose and contaminating the whole deal
thats the problem
ill tell you mick its like rising sun that crichton book its just like it
fujiwara even said that his boss ikeda would have him killed if he knew he was calling
so i asked him why he was talking to me and he said he said he wants million dollars
million and hell tell us who the saboteur is and give us a new lysine bug thats immune to the virus
we could be up and running in three days
andreas pauses takes it all in and then
how well do you know this guy
uh um well i met him a few weeks ago when he came over
and then he called a couple of times
so not very well
no i cant really say that
andreas ponders the situation
okay if you hear from him again talk him down on the price
i want you to find out the least amount of money hed settle for
if we can get a bug thats resistant to the virus it might be worth it
but i want you to keep this quiet if there is a mole we dont want him to know were onto him
whitacre stands with a cocktail in the fading light looking at the foundation for the new horse stables being built across the road from the main house
there is not another home anywhere nearby
thisd be a great place for some outlet stores
people would come from all over southern illinois and probably missouri too
famous name brand labels and appliances at savings of up to fifty per cent every day
maybe a food court with a mexican place
after the stables maybe a tennis court or a little pitch and putt by the pool that adds to resale value like nobodys business
whitacre looks at the swarm of insects around a street light
the birds eat the bugs the cars eat the birds the rust eats the cars and the new construction eats the rust
ginger interrupts whitacres grand plan from across the street
corky alexander says theres a bat in his room
whitacre shakes his head in disbelief
he paces nervously
stunned by the news
andreas and mark cheviron tell whitacre of his upcoming fbi interview
cheviron is a barrel chested linebacker of a man
a former decatur cop who is now private industrys version of a bouncer
i thought i was supposed to be getting him down on the price
thats what you told me to do and i was doing it
were not gonna sit back and let the japs fuck us sideways
i just dont understand we werent going to mention it and now hes in on it
of course hes in
if we got a mole then its a security issue
ill be sitting in with the fbi
but i already told you guys everything i know
whats the point
cheviron is annoyed by whitacres histrionics
we dont like the idea of talking to the fbi anymore than you do
look theyre just going to tape the guys calls and ask you a few questions
no big deal
whitacre shakes his head even more upset
we know how the fbi works
we can control this
whitacre has his doubts
ginger is putting away groceries when the phone rings
whitacre is on the phone pacing like a caged animal
now theyve got the fbi in on it
first they tell me theyre going to pay and be done with it now they want me to talk to the fbi
she sits down uneasy
this isnt like him to be so upset
why do you need to talk to the fbi
its their factory
let them talk to the fbi
im really uncomfortable about this baby
there are a lot of things going on here
what does that mean things
i just mean we have to be careful
whatever you do corky no matter whats going on just be honest with them and tell the truth
tell the truth no matter what the truth is
he considers her advice and hangs up the phone
whitacre looks out the window at the cold gray autumn day and weighs his options
leaves blow across the adm parking lot
he seems angry its spring time in nigeria you can bet theyre loving that
sitting around watching the days get longer watching the afternoon go by on their rolexes and cartiers
everyones just waiting on the mailman
while the poachers make the elephants extinct
the name mark whitacre is written across the top
special agent brian shepard sits with cheviron and a very anxious mark whitacre
shepard wears a rumpled dark suit and tie from the day jay edgar hoover set a dress code
he has been stationed in decatur where the odd dead body in a river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state lines have made up the last fifteen years
of his life
whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat
cheviron on the other hand is an old hand at this
he watches whitacre and says nothing
shepard writes down everything
he told me he wanted his payments deposited by wire transfer to numbered bank accounts in switzerland and the caribbean
and when was your last contact with him
two days ago
but i think hes getting suspicious
ive dragged this out as long as i can
if we dont get back to him soon he may back out
and these calls theyve been coming in on your home line
whitacre looks at cheviron theres clearly a right and wrong answer here
i have an adm line at my house a business line theyve been coming in on that
drifting from shepards face to his adams apple
the knot of his black fbi tie bobs up and down as he speaks
well we need to start by theres a sale at bacarachs putting a recording device on they get those oscar de la your phone
we should make renta ties that nobody buys arrangements to do that as except maybe wilson what soon as possible
we also are they two for one for need a list of everyone in another week
they never put the bioproducts division to the brioni ties on sale
i see if we can see whos should just get all the ties operating on the inside in paris wear them once or well want phone records twice
shove them in a duty employment histories and any free bag
other background checks that adm may have
i can help with that
so thats it then
i can go
shepard hands whitacre his card
they shake hands
id like to come out tomorrow and get on that phone
thanks for your time
whitacre comes in from a long day at work
ginger walks in from the kitchen
she gives him a welcome home hug but he doesnt let go holding on like a man caught in the current
you told them the truth mark
thats all you can do
they were watching me the whole time
cheviron was in the room
she slips from his arms disappointed
i never even got a chance
she doesnt accept his excuse and heads upstairs to bed
tanya called from school she has homework questions for you
whitacre stands in the vestibule alone
he walks through the big house shutting off lights he sits in a chair in the huge living room and leafs through an issue of national i go to cornell
and get a ph
and then to northwestern and get an mba mick andreas gets born with the vice president of the united states as his godfather
he goes to the nixons for thanksgiving my parents died in a car accident when i was three
i wound up in an orphanage
that was my thanksgiving
these photographers must wait forever to get these shots
although i heard a story that sometimes theyll throw a sandwich on the ground to get the panther to come down out of the tree
theyre just trying to do their jobs
wheres the harm the panther gets to eat
cheviron sits in bed with his wife watching tv
the phone jesus its late
whitacre paces while on the phone frantic and rambling
now my familys being threatened i cant put up with this
theyre threatening my daughter
she got a call at school
slow down mark
she said the guy sounded asian
they told her fujiwara couldnt wait
did you call the fbi
it just happened
he wants an answer
or he said shes in trouble
well talk about it in the morning
im thinking about quitting
moving my family out of here
i cant do this
well talk in the morning
whitacre puts down the phone and walks through the large dark house
he opens the bedroom door and the wedge of light finds ginger already half asleep
he lies down next to her in bed fully clothed
cheviron whitacre and mick andreas
whitacre is still agitated
you ever mention to fujiwara where your daughter went to school
if the guy wants to threaten you why not just call you
he told her to write down the message
i want her to tell the fbi what they said
andreas moves toward the phone
i dont want her talking to the fbi definitely not
why not mark
come on if shes really in danger
then ill talk to her
andreas picks up the phone
whitacre doesnt want that either
shes scared enough
if someones threatening her
whitacre collapses theres more to this
dont call her
no ones threatening
a long painful beat
i made it up
there wasnt any threat
cheviron shakes his head in disgust
christ what a waste of time
andreas lowers his gaze at whitacre he wants an explanation
im no good at this
the fbi guy really got to me last night
hes twisting in the wind
i figured if you guys thought my daughter was in danger youd just pay fujiwara and all this fbi stuff would go away
it was a stupid move on my part
stupid stupid move
he gets up and leaves in humiliation
he wanders through the lobby of adm in a daze
what am i supposed to do
i didnt get the fbi involved i was told we were paying the money
its like whitacre go out for a long pass and then we run the ball
look i admitted i made a mistake thats more than i can say for most people
hey when they found out that micks dad dwayne wrote a check to the watergate burglars did he admit it
besides these guys probably own the fbi with the money they have
they probably wanted me to move into dwaynes old house because theyve got it wired like in a crichton novel
he wanders into his office
sid hulse wants to know if you can have dinner at seven instead of seven thirty and marty allison called
jump shrimp on shaved ice
were into shrimp now fish too
tilapia its like orange roughie but lighter theyre growing out there next to the corn
whitacre and a very done up ginger dine with sid hulse the used car version of a lysine salesman at the club
mauve draped tables botanical drawings of the state flower on the wall
bow tied wait staff patrol the diners with pitchers of ice water
sid and ginger chit chat mark is distracted
someone told me they bugged the dining room the john too
might be paying off the waitresses here at the club
thats how business get done
clients go to relieve themselves
off her earrings mark got them abroad
whitacre shoots him a look
not funny sid
youre telling me
ginger doesnt get the joke
marks never been to nigeria
he covertly slides a business card into gingers hand
so where are you off to tomorrow
on the back is scribbled the fbi is coming at pm
west coast swing i gotta get out there and kick some japanese butt
so ill see you in a couple of weeks
shes still digesting whats on the card trying to act natural
then you guys can maybe have a chance to play some golf
whitacre throws an arm around her
ginger and mark drive home in silence
there should be a tv show about a guy who calls home one day and hes there
he answers hes talking to himself only its someone else
hes somehow divided into two and the second one of him drives away and the rest of the show is about him trying to find the guy
should i get alexander out of the house
its not like that itll be ok
what do they do in school to the kids who cant keep a secret no bmw for those boys
ginger and whitacre
whitacre tries to plead his position to his wife its not as black and white as she assumes
just tell them everything
i dont like what this company is doing to you
this is a chance to go somewhere else
you said mexico
i may tell them at some point but not now
right now im going to follow the company line
mark adm is not more powerful than the fbi
you cant tell me that
its more complicated than that
her face is a mask of determination
mark if you dont tell them i will
behind him the drapes are illuminated by headlights in the drive
he is desperate he softly repeats
i cant not now
the door bell rings
she opens the door
good evening agent shepard this is my wife ginger
whitacre knows he has to keep the two of them apart
i know its late
ill be out of your hair in a minute just show me where the uh
the line in question
right the office line is upstairs
shepard and whitacre head upstairs leaving ginger behind
any calls since yesterday
she stays on the ground floor and strains to hear if her husband is opening up
its tomorrow there
when its ten at night here its three in the afternoon in tokyo
shepard has completed his work
a small tape recorder sits on the desk next to a fax machine
whitacre wants him gone
simple device here just make go ahead open up to your sure you hit the record wife see what it gets you
button and the play button spend the rest of your life when he calls and youll see explaining why your career a red light come on dont went out the
window followed hit rewind or youll record by your wife after the golf over it
and your kids after some angle dust and the police are right back here
hit the record button right
whitacre walks shepard to the door where ginger is waiting
ill give you a call tomorrow and we can test it out
hey thanks for coming by brian
have a good night
good night mrs
shepard walks toward his car
ginger and mark linger
to her husband are you going to say something or am i
ginger pushes past him
whitacre has no choice he finishes her sentence
you gotta minute
whitacre walks past his wife toward the car
ginger squeezes his hand as he passes her on the steps
most of what we do is to impress girls i bet there are guys like circus guys who fall off the tight rope and on the way down all they
think about are girls until they hit the ground not even about growing wings real fast just girls going by they were going to find out anyway cuz of mick
who knows what mick and dwayne have been telling them about me already
the two men speak in the dome light of shepards dodge r dynasty
you want to go back inside
i think they might have it bugged
were safer out here
shepard is confused
whitacre takes a moment but decides to go on
this used to be dwayne andreas house you know that
im aware of that
there are things i know but if i decide to tell you whats going on could i be prosecuted for it
i cant provide you with immunity but any information you tell me about your involvement in criminal activity would be discussed with the us attorneys office in a favorable light
whitacre stares forward a beat
shepard gets out his notebook
everything i told you yesterday about fujiwara was true except one thing
i never received a call from him on the office line
shepard looks at whitacre hes confused
why did you tell me that you did
before i spoke with you mick andreas and mark cheviron coached me on what to say
they told me to tell you that the calls came in on my business line instead of my home line
whitacre pauses again
its too late to turn back
what im about to tell you involves something very large
this extortion attempt by fujiwara is nothing compared to it
shepard says nothing
it involves price fixing in the lysine business
ive been in several meetings with our japanese and korean competitors in the past few months where the sole purpose has been to fix prices
adm made me go to these meetings
shepard writes furiously struggling to see in the dark
thats why they wanted me to lie
fujiwaras calling on my home line
but so are the people we fix prices with
they didnt want you to hear those conversations so they told me to say the fujiwara calls came in on the adm line
but i knew if you guys ever started looking at the records youd see all these calls i have to japan
and thats what scared me
nobody has more calls than me
if you ever figured out about the price fixing id be the fall guy
shepard considers the explanation
who told you to participate in these price fixing talks
whitacre pauses summons his conviction
im operating under the direction of mick and dwayne andreas
ginger checks on her son
whos dad talking to
a friend who needs his help
she walks down the hall pausing by a window
she can see the two men talking in the car
she turns off the light and gets into bed staring at the ceiling
shepard writes down everything
mick and cheviron had me call fujiwara today and tell him to stop calling until things cool off
they told you to tell him to stop calling
theyre afraid of what you guys might find out
can you give me a tape recorder
i can prove this if you give me a tape recorder
ill take a polygraph if that helps
shepard is out of pages in his notebook
i want to thank you for being honest with me tonight
youre not going to ask questions at adm about all this
itd be my job for sure
no what was said here was confidential
im going to speak to my superiors mark and then well be in touch
whitacre goes back inside his dark house and heads upstairs he seems unburdened
he seems like a real good guy
i mean just a straight shooter
i think we really got along i bet he wouldnt mind if i called him brian instead of agent shepard
this must be very different for him
talking to a guy like me instead of a bank robber or a drug dealer
struggling to read his notes in the car
i could see us fishing or whatever
what a good listener you dont meet one of those everyday
shepard takes out his cell phone
we hear ringing on the other end
a sleepy voice answers
i just got done talking to whitacre theres something much bigger going on here
whitacre tries to look natural as he walks to his office his first day as a whistle blower
no sooner does he take his seat than cheviron appears baring down on him though his glass walled office
what happened last night
they put a recorder on my line
and thats it
yeah and i was instructed that when fujiwara calls im to record the conversation
whitacre gets buzzed by his secretary
your wife on two
well make sure you do it because they have ways of checking to see if youre going to or not
whitacre picks up the call and the big bully goes away
we hear ginger very excited on the other end of the phone
tell me what happened
whitacre listens leafs through his mail
does anyone win that publishers clearing house thing
someone must right
otherwise its against the law
someone gets a million dollars or someone goes to jail
a small conference room with bad green wall paper and a view of the illinois capital building
shepard briefs agent dean paisley and agent in charge kate medford
he searches through his large pile of notes for the most shocking of last nights revelations
medford eats her morning yogurt
minutes or someone would come after ed macmahon
you cant use the us mail that way
and a guy like ed macmahon would never get involved
a pound of bacon a peanut butter sandwich some vitamins anything that adm has a hand in its all fixed thats what hes telling me
basically everyone in this country is the victim of corporate crime by the time they finish breakfast
medford studies the ingredients of her yogurt
so what do we have
anti trust violations providing false information
whitacre is still on the phone pacing the person at the other end of the line is doing most of the talking
who can you trust
you trust your wife
ok but whats the divorce rate
he told me that the motto at adm is
the competitors are our friends and the customers are our enemies
did you discuss with him the notion of wearing a wire
is he willing to
whitacre is headed down the hall with a full head of steam
you think the automobile companies cant make a car tomorrow that gets a hundred miles to the gallon
you think the tv networks dont know whos going to win the world series before the season starts
one potential problem i see going forward with adm is this guy cheviron
he wants to be kept in the loop on everything were doing
he storms down the corridors of adm
paranoid is what people who are trying to take advantage call you in an effort to get you to drop your guard i read that the other day in an
in flight magazine
about a third the size of whitacres office with a view of the loading dock
whitacre bursts in
you told me they were only going to tap one line
they are only monitoring one line
thats not true
i just talked to my wife and some woman named regina from the phone company called saying both our lines are tapped
my home phone
cheviron is sick of whitacres antics
he doesnt believe a word
it gets a bit heated
come on the phone company doesnt call people and say hello just thought wed let you know the fbi is tapping your phone lines
then why would regina say that
she didnt say it youre saying it
call my wife
chevirons tone becomes condescending like hes talking to a sick person
whitacre storms out
walking away satisfied he passes a secretary making copies
she tugs on her wool turtleneck
i dont like wool on skin
not even that merino wool they have at fields in chicago
ginger likes it cuz its form fitting but she likes avocados and who wants that texture in their mouth
cheviron stares at his phone and then relents
he picks up the phone but not to call regina
who would make up someone named regina
on the third floor of some mid s default architecture in the heart of downtown decatur brian shepard sits in an office big enough for himself a small evidence safe
a picture of his family and the flag
out the window the stacks of adm send up great white plumes
shepard is boning up on anti trust law when the phone rings
brian its mark cheviron at adm
hey i asked you guys a couple of days ago which lines at mark whitacres house you were going to be monitoring and we agreed it would just be the
so thats all you did right
i really cant answer that
whitacre stares out through the glass walls drinking a coke
mick andreas and cheviron are making a bee line for him
off the coke can it doesnt taste the same when dwayne andreas got the government to subsidize corn farmers it all changed
corn syrup got to be cheaper than sugar so they went with the high fructose corn syrup from adm
they said you couldnt tell the difference but thats just a lie like when they replaced butter with topping at the movies
and you know who was behind that
mick andreas and cheviron march into whitacres office on a mission
weve decided that were not going to be cooperating with any further fbi requests
whitacre puts it all together
he is outraged
he turns on cheviron
i knew it
i knew it
i knew we should never have done this
i told you but you wouldnt listen
they said just the office line
cheviron has to eat shit here in front of andreas
evidently they were lying to us too
sounds to me like you cant keep track of what the fbi is doing
the phone buzzes
the call you were expecting mark
whitacre pauses then picks up
im working on this deal in sweden i have to take this
whitacre picks up the phone
andreas and cheviron continue
i told shepard were done working with them as of now
whitacre picks up the phone
its not sweden
mark its brian can you talk
whitacre shifts uncomfortably and tries to cover in front of mick and cheviron he puts on a phony cheerful voice
over the phone yeah hey its good to hear from you
id like to bring my supervisor by later around six
hey i got mr
andreas in here right now
ok ill talk to you soon
he hangs up the phone and turns back to mick and terry
whitacre smiles warmly and then lies through his teeth
so what do i do if this shepard guy calls
you let me know and ill pass it on to my dad
but youre done talking to them
whitacre sits with fbi agents shepard and paisley in the converted barn
a large open room looking more like a theme restaurant than anything that might have once involved agriculture
outside rusty the gardener fishes leaves from the pool
shepard explains the misunderstanding with the phones
the only listening device was the recorder mark
we had a trap and trace device on the home line but we cant listen in with that
however the phone company calling people and telling them about our intel gathering is well our face is red on that one
did you bring the expense reports we talked about
whitacre gives them a folder of paperwork
its all there tokyo hong kong paris and mexico city
whitacre thinks about one thing while discussing another with the agents
he is a gifted man in this capacity
his thoughts take precedence here
just last week mick and terry i read in the geographic that were in florida with the corn the skin in ears grows from refiners association
they the inside out conveyor would have their regular belt style
thats how they meetings during the day and stay clean
you could make a then at night theyd get dot with a felt tip inside together and work out the and watch it move down your price fixing
six months later a liter of pepsi costs five cents more
whens the next meeting
january somewhere in asia
paisley takes it all in
he cozies up to whitacre
mark i gotta ask you why are you doing this
we know you lied to us about the phone line and youre afraid of that
but now youre telling us all this other stuff out of the blue
i gotta ask you why
the light disappears from whitacres eyes
things are going on i dont approve of
i mean im a biochemist but they pulled me into the business side and theyre doing things that are illegal
he takes the net for cleaning the pool and walks around the barn to the attached six car garage filled with a range rover ferrari mercedes coupe bmw and a
lincoln town car
if i was going to grow with adm i had to be a part of the business side of things
rusty pulls the garage down on the cars
when they told me to lie i had to lie
i lied to you guys and i feel real bad about it
this explains the bind whitacre finds himself in
you look at yourself as wearing a white hat and theyre wearing black hats
thats a good way to put it
you know when i was a kid my folks died in an automobile accident
i was maybe six at the time and this wealthy man in ohio adopted me
he owned amusement parks and he did real well for himself real well
i got a big break went to a good school and all i adopted two kids of my own
i just want to do the right thing
well mark do you think youd be willing to go a few steps further in helping us
what do you mean
would you be willing to wear a wire
we dont have any other sources at this time
we need your help
whitacre considers the request a chance to be a hero
now you realize that by doing this sometime down the line you could be the guy who has to testify against your fellow executives people youve worked with now for
that wont be easy
he looks around at the good life whitacre has amassed
ill use my beeper to signal you when its time to set up a meeting
shepard gets out his beeper and hits a button beeeep
when you hear this you call me
then shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket a simple little radio shack dictaphone model
he gives it to whitacre
youll be risking a lot
whitacre picks up the recorder
the idea of being a white knight only becomes real when they hand you a sword
whitacre wilson and andreas get out of a town car in front of coors corporate headquarters
the rockies loom in the background
the men walk toward the doors
i was up in wisconsin last week and the guy who is running for governor
the republican guy
i was told they want funds a campaign contribution but i told them were already at out limit
you can go over the limit its just a small fine
thats what i was saying
if they want a thousand dollars you give a thousand
so what if it ends up costing us nine thousand after the fine
twelve thousand after taxes
the men laugh
if the guys asking you for money try not giving it to him and see what happens
just make sure dad is behind it
is dad asking for them
ill let howard know
he gets out his cell phone and begins dialing
a fedex employee walks by with a butterfly bandage on his nose
there are these butterflies in central america they have poison in their wings
just enough poison to stop a bird heart
but the birds know this somehow so they dont eat them
through the phone we hear
hi youve reached mark whitacre in adms bioproducts division
leave a message
whitacre punches in his code
theyre like blue orange and yellow
real pretty but poisonous to birds
over the phone we hear a message
mark its marty allison calling from london we need to
whitacre hits a button
but there are other ones butterflies theyre orange blue and yellow too
but no poison
over the phone we hear the next message
whitacre deletes it and hangs up
theyre just flying around looking dangerous getting by on their looks
wilson and andreas discuss some female employee in a most untoward way
they laugh and wait for whitacre by the doors
jesus mark this is important bioproduct stuff were discussing
the men enter the building and head for a bank of elevators
im sorry guys i gotta return a call
ill meet you
andreas and wilson hit the elevator button
whitacre paces across the lobby and talks on the phone
hey its mark
i told you i was out on business this week
the case is getting some attention from the bureau mark
theres another agent working with me now
we need to meet
yeah but im away now
any word from fujiwara
i think hes out of the picture
based on what
is andreas telling you to say that
ill let you guys know if i hear anything
i cant talk now
i gotta meeting
whitacre hangs up
and jogs toward the elevators
wilson and andreas hold the door
shepard sits in the small office with his new partner bob herndon and squeaky clean
if shepard looks like he stepped out of dragnet then herndon looks like he stepped out of gq
the guy is on a plane half his life and in meetings for the rest
any tapes of these meetings
not yet mr
whitacre believes his life may be in danger
whitacres life is in danger
hes taking a new bmw for a ferocious test drive
a big shit eating eighty mile an hour spread across his face
hes closely watched at work and theres reason to believe that adm has bugged his home
hes under a great deal of pressure
whitacre looks at the cup holders in the beemer
the german word for cup is tasse and saucer thats untertasse the undercup
what do we have cup and saucer
where does that get you
whitacre pulls into the dealership and screeches to a halt in front of the bmw salesman
whitacre smiles and nods
we had a good day at work tom
a real good day
shepard and herndon
you should probably take your gun off when you meet him weapons make him pretty nervous
the whitacre family checks out the new car
you gotta feel for the guy he tells us the truth one day and wakes up the next with two lives instead of one
whitacre checks his messages from a pay phone in the admirals club in the international terminal
hey mark its marty calling again and
whitacre punches a button
whitacre punches the buttons on his cell phone angrily
its mark brian
its been hard for me to return a page
im out of the country
we need to know if you had any further contact from fujiwara
i told you the guy has stopped calling
what about the price fixing
have you been able to make any tapes
i think you guys hanging around has really scared adm straight too word is were going to do things by the book
mick said its over
no more price fixing
shepard is confused
when did this happen
mick sat me down and said mark were going to start doing things your way
mark the fbi knows about these crimes were gonna investigate either way
you told us yourself
what does either way mean
we really need to get together
both shepard and whitacre are losing their patience
i told you its a different attitude now a different approach
whitacre hangs up frustrated
he walks over to a table in the club where a middle aged german man is waiting reinhart richter
there are papers spread out in piles around the men stacks of loss gain and opportunity
where were we
whitacre reaches underneath his suit coat into his shirt pocket and pulls out his pen
whitacres fountain pen has exploded in his shirt leaving a rorschach across his chest
richter gestures toward the stain
whitacre stares at the stain
one of the japanese guys told me a story this lysine salesman is in a meeting with someone from conagra or some other company i dont know and the client
leans forward and says i have the same tie as you
only the pattern is reversed
and then he drops dead
face down on the then
shepard and herndon are waiting in the most generic of hotel rooms for whitacre
they check their watches and peak out the drapes at a sparsely populated parking lot
theyve been there awhile
herndon eats a granola bar and reads the side of the package
maybe everyone has a sentence like that a little time bomb
i have the same tie as you
only the patterns reversed
there it is high fructose corn syrup
shepard isnt giving up on whitacre yet
he said andreas called him into a marketing meeting
the government ought to charge him for the room
shepards cell phone rings
herndon sighs here it comes
youre being honest with me here
its been months mark we need some tapes
whitacre sits alone in the hampton hotel parking lot next to the mall staring up at at a the lights of a room
i gotta go bri andreas is coming
whitacre opens his brief case and takes out the micro cassette recorder
he looks at it like its a murder weapon
over the phone mark we could be tracing this phone call
i cant live two lives
they just gave me a hundred thousand dollar raise
i cant risk my job for you guys
ive got a family
im building stables across the road
but you told us
the price fixing is over
the price of lysine is down to
and then remembering his lie
just a minute mick
the windows of the bmw are fogging up
mark listen to me the only logical thing for you to do is cooperate
and what if i dont
then somebody else will and youll end up being a defendant
for how long brian
how long does this go on for
whitacre pushes the buttons on the recorder
he hits eject
theres no tape in the cradle
i wish i could answer that
well need a lot of tapes maybe hundreds
but the tapes wont say anything
fine if thats what he said then i want to hear the tape
we need tapes mark
a beat he finally admits it
the windows are completely fogged
i didnt make any ok
i didnt make any because its over
how can i prove it to you
whitacre sits shirtless on the bed with the straps of a polygraph across his torso
herndon fits him with a blood pressure cuff and puts electrical clips on his fingers
i like my hands
i think theyre probably my favorite part of my body
i think that can be used to my advantage in social situations if i can get people focused on my hands then i can get a good result in the
contd eye contact is real important too
ill use the lotion in the hotel room on my hands the little bottles
single serving portions
bob has good hands too
herndon takes out a list of questions and watches whitacre closely
shepard watches the needle on the polygraph
now bobs going to ask you what do we lose a liter of questions mark
and you perspiration while we sleep
just need to answer them with that all goes into the a yes or no
thats all mattress
you have to say
are you married
have you ever lied to better your position
were you born in
did fujiwara ever telephone you at home and tell you there was a mole at adm
before this year did you ever lie to someone you really trusted
whitacre strains to see the read out to see how hes doing
did fujiwara say he would tell you who the mole was for million dollars
the needle traces a reassuringly straight line across the grid
is there currently any price in tokyo they sell little fixing activity in the girl underwear in the vending bioproducts division of adm
machines right on the main drag the ginza
guys in suits buying used girl panties how is that ok
now im going to ask you the same questions again to make sure the results are consistent
whitacre nods and smiles
watches the needle rock steady
i wonder where bob carries his gun
fbi agents have to wear them at all times even when theyre off duty
are you married
id like to see dwayne andreas hooked up to one of these
have you ever lied to better your position
once i told the stewardess i was claustrophobic so i could get an aisle seat
shepard and herndon step out of the room
herndon speaks to whitacre over his shoulder
you can get dressed mark
the door closes and the agents look at each other
whitacre buttons his shirt and puts his tie back on
he looks out the hotel room window at the snow
in the parking lot a high school kid drinks a beer while trying to write his name in urine in the snowbank
theyre all different
every flake is its own one of a kind version of itself
and some people still dont believe in god
i mean what more proof do you need than that herndon and shepard re enter
hey howd i do
mark we have some problems
wait a minute i watched the machine i didnt see any changes
mark you dont know how to read a polygraph
ive heard these things theyre not always per cent accurate
ive been telling the truth
herndon plays the bad cop
mark you splattered the walls with ink
come on now extortionists dont just leave their name and number then go away
whitacre nods his eyes water he sighs
i know its tough keeping it all bottled up inside keeping it a secret
but theres only one good choice for you
thats all theres ever been
theres something youre hiding something youre keeping from us
but the only way to protect yourself is to be completely honest
shepard gets another form out of his brief case
not a basic this time its a confession
you realize this document can be used against you in a court of law
whitacre nods grimly
what happened with fujiwara and the saboteur
i made it up
i had to
shepard and herndon cringe on his behalf
the floodgates open
shepard transcribes the confession
weve had problems at the plant with viruses were way behind projections
dwayne was thinking about shutting us down and everyone was on me to fix it
lets just blame it all on whitacre
thats how it is there
it was my job they were talking about
we just moved here from europe they made me vp
and the reason you agreed to help adm purchase a new bug
i wanted to be part of the team
i thought it would help my relationship with mick if he thought i would do something like that
and what about the price fixing
it isnt over is it
theres no new attitude
theres been meetings all along in the past three weeks even
again whitacres mind allows him to be two places at once
and not just in lysine mick andreas or his dad
citric acid gluconate
one theyd never lie for me
they guy he was forced to leave say were in it together
the company because he what a joke
team building wouldnt do it the off site meetings at the some gluconate guy
hes out of a lake in wisconsin i cant job now
they had me go to protect these guys if theyre chicago and meet with the breaking the law
hey i guys from ajinomoto to try tried
anybody could see the and set volume levels for choices i had
i did my best lysine production
its a for adm
you dont see them matter of dividing up the here in the electric chair
market between the producers its all make us lysine and then setting a workable mark
handle the fbi price
theres another mark
crap us out some meeting in about a month
if theres anything else you want to add nows the time
you need to tell us
no thats the full story
we want tapes mark
he slides the confession across to whitacre who nods and signs
he gives both agents christmas cards and smiles
ill give you all the tapes you want
merry christmas you guys
whitacre aims the ferrari into his designated parking space and gets out of the car
he walks toward the building
as the camera arcs around to lead him we see that he is actually speaking out loud not in vo
seven thirty a
wednesday march seventeenth
i have just parked my car and am now entering the office
whitacre gets on the elevator with terry wilson
whitacres a little off this morning
s whitacre contd terrance wilson president of our corn businesses did you speak with our friends in japan
he wasnt in
i heard from mimoto last night he is pissed
he said theres not going to be any peace in lysine until we bring production down like we promised
theelevator doors opens
in we did exactly what we told them we would do in terms of volume
right now theres no promise
he said hed like to talk to you at some point
be right there lookin at him
say listen here you little mousy motherfucker
wilson peels off into his office
whitacre continues on across the open trading floor toward his office
he speaks under his breath to nobody smiling at the world
that was terry wilson talking about setting volume and price levels with our japanese competitor ajinomoto corporation
whitacre enters his own office talking to himself
by the way there was no discussion with mimoto last night
that was all for illustration purposes only
i wanna make that clear no discussion with mimoto last night
he turns off the tape recorder
whitacre paces while herndon and shepard listen to a tape
hes got three more recordings in his briefcase
hey mark you dont really need to narrate the tapes for us when youre making them
not a problem
and you can talk less
i think i did on this one
whitacre gives herndon another tape and a small box
dont force the conversation
but theyre good right
i mean you guys wouldnt believe what goes on at these meetings
ive got well over two million frequent flier miles
the equivalent of two trips to the moon
im pretty much platinum across the board
sometimes theyll move me from business to first just cuz the computer tells them im there
whitacre emerges from the hotel and gets in a cab
and you can redeem them for anything now
a movado watch or a fly fishing vacation in montana
whitacre tells the driver
american embassy please
its like miles every time i go to zurich paris munich
dont even know how many miles are in the delta account
i just give ginger the statements
im probably one of the youngest guys ever to go over a million miles
i get a letter from the ceo every year thanking me
its a form letter but it looks like hes really signing it
they probably walk in one day and he signs like a hundred while hes on the phone
whitacre gets out of the car and walks into the embassy
shepard meets him an ushers him into a room where a phone is hooked up to a recorder
you should probably use your adm credit card
whitacre dials the phone
you make it some place good for dinner last night
i just ate in the hotel
whatd you have
the call rings through
hey its mark whitacre calling from paris for mick andreas
hey its mark
i just got out of the lysine meeting
it went great
i think we can keep it at around a buck and a quarter no problem
he follows shepards hands from kleenex to coffee cup to pen to a tug on his ear
now what happens
something you breathe in on an airplane
some little bacteria and now its on his hands the cup the phone
probably got it from his kids and now ill spend the weekend with it in bed
and ill miss a few days next week or alexander run a fever and who pays for that
where does the fbi weigh in on that as a cooperating witness what does it say about exposure to airborne contaminants
i adm compensated for me missing work
whitacre walks down the concourse carrying a black folder with adm emblazoned on it
he turns into the bathroom and stares at himself in the mirror
he checks his hair and then opens the folder
he removes the legal pad to reveal a secret compartment holding a small tape recorder
into tape recorder this is tape seven side two
chicago ohare airport
he looks at himself in the mirror
and then down at his feet
a black chuckles candy lies on the floor swarmed by ants
the black chuckle being carted away by ants inches from his wing tips
thats a big break right there definitely
theres no choices to be made
its there youre an ant you eat it you bring it back for the other ants
they dont say theyd rather have the cherry flavored one
real simple to live like that
wilson sits at a table with two french executives rollier and crouy
wilson wields the fountain pen
the lounge did well in the s and has decided to stay there most everything is covered in red velvet except for the waitresses theyre covered in sequined body suits
whitacre returns from the bathroom
he puts the tape recorder folder on the table
wilson rests his cocktail on we cannot have one section of the world where it works and the rest of the world where it doesnt
it will not last
debate and discussion
they just keep the black one from making it home
we would obviously play the game
but the koreans and the japanese
itll never work then
a tray of drinks attached to a walking centerfold goes by
look everyone has to share terry doesnt like me very numbers
its so goddamn much
hes got blotchy simple
how the hell else skin
what causes that would you do it
it must mean its what we do in the citric something medical
hell acid business and look at the have a stroke and someone price of vitamins
will say he was blotchy
lets not forget that if prices went up in europe its because we talked in mexico first
thats right you made it happen
shepherd has headphones on hes excited by what he hears
whitacre excitedly diagrams the worlds lysine market on a dry erase board for herndon illustrating the relationships a primer in corporate greed
loud because of the mark these are just the kind of tapes we need
over the headphones it didnt just go up like that you made it happen
and were getting our marching orders from andreas it goes all the way up
loud because of the we need to improve the quality of the recordings
why dont you guys just bug the building
its not that easy mark
therere a lot legal issues
he has an idea
give me your pants
whitacre undoes the pants of his sage green suit
being able to do two things at once is a big part of success
i try and do abdominal exercises
even when im at a meeting
and then releasing
and there are leg ones i do in the car
ill even floss in the shower while the conditioner is in my hair
during the part where youre just supposed to leave it in
those things can really add up to a significant time savings
rusty the gardener blows leaves off the driveway
whitacre pulls out of the six car garage in a lincoln town car
he yells at rusty over the leaf blower
hey rusty check this out
whitacre gets out of the car and places his briefcase on the hood
what do you think
its a nice briefcase
whitacre opens the briefcase and pulls a secret panel to reveal a tape recorder
he couldnt be more proud
thats a nagra model number a right there
the bureau had that custom made for me mark whitacre secret agent double fourteen
why double fourteen
cuz im twice as smart as double seven
whitacre wearing the sage colored suit he gave herndon sits with andreas and some adm suits on the company plane
andreas chats with one co worker and then turns to whitacre
whatever happened to that girl who was working for us didnt she move to california
whats her name tina
shes getting married
my tina is getting married
two or three weekends from now
that wont last for very long
shes kind of a do do head you know
shell be back
i just hope she doesnt get pregnant
fuck up her body
itd ruin her tits
shes got the greatest tits in the world
he leans in to whitacre
in the world
whitacre looks out the window at white billowing clouds
when polar bears hunt they crouch down by a hole in the ice and wait for a seal to pop up
they keep one paw over their nose so that they blend in
cuz theyve got those black noses
theyd blend in perfectly if not for the nose
whitacre descends the steps of the jet followed by andreas and some other suits
whitacre peels off the group
im just gonna hit the head here
so the question is
how do they know their noses are black
from looking at other polar bears
do they see their reflections in the water
and think id be invisible if not for that
that seems like a lot of thinking for a bear
an african american man s stands at the sink
other than that the room is empty
whitacre could you follow me
the two men enter a stall
can i ask you to remove your shirt
theres something great about walking into a conference room when theres a pad of paper and a pencil in front of every chair
most guys with a science background dont get to see what goes on
a uniformed hotel worker arranges the orange juice coffee croissants melon plate
a pen and pad of paper is put in front of every seat
a flip chart stands ready in the corner
the meticulous worker makes everything perfect pausing for a moment to adjust a lamp
usually the hotels name is embossed on the pencils and they have someone who sharpens them to perfect points like collie dog noses thats what they remind me of
maybe they come from the factory that way
and theres always a plate of danish
an almond thing or a cheese danish with a big cherry blob in the middle
the african american agent finishes shaving whitacres chest
he takes out a roll of surgical tape and attaches a small nagra recorder to whitacre
small wires attach to switches sewn into whitacres pants pockets
the almond thing makes a lot of crumbs and i usually use my pencil to sweep them away like one of those tools professional waiters use at the decatur club
you want to try it
whitacre flips the pocket switch
whitacre and andreas duck into a limo
one of the adm suits who flew in on the jet slaps andreas on the back
good luck with the japs
and as your lawyer id advise you to pat em down for wires
andreas laughs at the suit but whitacres not laughing
the limo pulls away
uh should we really pat them down
they dont have the balls to mess with adm
when its over the board of directors at adm is gonna understand
theyre gonna see the position i was in and that i acted in everyones best interest i think thats the only conclusion they can reach
whitacre andreas yamada and ikeda get on the elevator
a sign says the marriott welcomes ajinomoto corporation and i mean im the youngest division president theyve ever had and i speak a number of languages fluently
the same room we saw being prepared now from the pov of a hidden camera
the four executives enter the room and move toward the table
everything is perfect
whitacre notices the lamp and walks right toward it curious
the lamp is the look away mark look away
whitacres face fills the wide angle lens
shepard and herndon huddle around the video monitor
herndon is dressed like a uniformed hotel worker
shepard is still dressed like a g man from the s
i told him it was in the lamp
whitacre turns from the lamp
the execs sit around the table eating the baked goods and discussing business
we already spent more than one year uh to get better market situation in lysine
we talked a little bit about it in paris but we need to have an understanding on volume
its off center just the top of his head and then tilts down and zooms into his tie
shepard struggles with the joystick that controls the lipstick camera in the lamp his framing is way off
widen out bri we need a wide shot of these guys working together
still struggling with the joystick
we have a big board of directors
we have public shareholders
like you weve suffered
prices are nowhere near where we hoped they would be
now the question is if the market grows who gets it
ikeda goes over to the easel and makes a pie chart as a visual aid for andreas proposal
if kyowa hakko miwon and cheil corporation each get two thousand tons then we can divide up the rest
if were going to have any stability at all
i think some of these adm guys lie about their golf scores
it doesnt even matter and they still lie about it and that says something about character
contd i mean ive seen guys putt three times and say they got a par
or theyll go off into the woods to find their ball and theyll move it from behind a tree or from under a leaf
i admit ive done it a couple of times but i dont tell people im a really good golfer when im not
im sure if i worked at it
whitacre is distracted by a clicking sound
he shifts uncomfortably
andreas notices the sound and pauses
his briefcase seems to be the source of the clicking
ikeda gets andreas attention
we need some specific number
what would you be willing to accept
isnt that the question
whitacre nudges his briefcase
shepard and herndon
whats mark doing
they pan over to whitacre
hes opening the briefcase with the hidden tape recorder
what an idiot
as yamada approaches the easel with andreas whitacre has opened his brief case
the clicking is coming from inside
the others will say that adm has already eaten all the growth
he removes the panel concealing the tape recorder fiddles with a pieces of the lining caught in the apparatus
you gotta remember we have a lot more capacity than were using
we could be growing twenty thousand tons isnt that right mark
whitacre is still fiddling with the case
whatre you doing
andreas crosses the room and without looking inside at the recorder that is ruining his life shuts the case
i need your input here
ikeda is standing at the easel making calculations next to the pie chart
on the tape adm will be allocated its recent production plus a number we will call alpha
pull back to reveal herndon and shepard presenting their prized tape to robin mann esq early s humorless and contrary
the tape plays
what did he say i cant understand him
on the tape i dont care what you call it just as long as we get what we want
the men on the tape all laugh
whitacre and ikeda shake hands
and then whitacre ripsoffthe sheet of paper from the easel with the pie chart onit
on the tape i guess i should probably keep this huh
shepard freezes the tape triumphantly
wheres the agreement
theres just a discussion
if this isnt an agreement then what are they doing there
dont get bogged down in the words look at the actions
i see a chart with a bunch of numbers
but i cant pinpoint any agreement per se
what do you want
the guy is standing there dividing up the market plain as day
herndon opens up the evidence bag and shows her the flip chart page that whitacre took at the end of the meeting a smoking gun
it could just be a proposal
all the other companies werent there
nobody used the word agreement
im just telling you as a lawyer what their lawyers are going to say
herndon and shepard look at whitacre frozen on the monitor
they are discouraged
i dont know how much more we can ask of the guy
im not going to move for indictments with this
i need more
whitacre sits with marty allison whos voice weve heard on whitacres voice mail many times
the two are old friends and co workers martys been trying to get marks ear for some time now
theyve got some business together
i feel like a real jerk here but i need the dough
nah well figure something out
i hope its not a big deal but ive been looking at a house and i need the cash back
marty when i hired you what did you want
but i went to wilson and told him you wouldnt work here for less than seventy five and i got it
you were the first guy i hired
mark youve always been real generous with me and
whitacre waves off the flattery
i gotta leave town for a couple of days but when i get back heres what i want you to do
i like to think of myself as a good gift giver
it shows that youre thinking about the other person even when theyre not right in front of you
contd i know that ginger likes jewelry and that the kids like stuff from other countries
even if you just pick it up at the duty free at the airport with whatever money you have left over
whitacre drops off more tapes for shepard and herndon
we got a problem mark
you cant take our equipment to japan
we have no jurisdiction
so ill take notes like in vancouver
whitacre takes out his dictaphone and puts it on the bed
well sure but theres something else id like you to think about
like i said we cant give you any recording equipment
but if you taped the meeting on your own and than gave us the tapes
so you want me to make a tape
were not allowed to say that
but the sooner we get enough evidence the sooner you can stop the taping
what if i get caught there
i dont know anything about japanese laws but if youre arrested we may not be able to provide much help
thats why we need these lysine association meetings on us soil
make it easier to wrap this up
shepard picks up the recorder
you cant use any of our equipment
whitacre walks out of the radio shack with a small bag
i wonder if brian and bob are really allowed to do that it seems kind of shady
i probably shouldve gotten them to sign something just in case
turned the tables on them seeing how im the one going above and beyond the call of duty
he heads out of the mall
whitacre wilson and a collection of asian lysine execs discuss prices and customers
do we want to talk about guys tape meetings all the latin america
time lets say a guy is dyslexic and he needs to take notes
whats he gonna do
mimoto and ikeda enter
good morning we are late
no problem no problem you lost twenty thousand tons but hey
the group laughs at the wacky price fixing joke
whitacre checks his watch
i gotta take a moment
whitacre walks down the hall toward the rest room
i read this thing about moustaches on the flight back from zurich
what facial hair says to women about a mans level of honesty
i think maybe it was in esquire magazine
some psychological theory
whitacre reaches into his suit jacket and takes out the recorder
he studies himself in the bathroom mirror and then flips the tape
i should ask brian and bob about it get the fbis point of view
imperial palace hotel side two tape one
just as he is putting the tape back into his jacket the door opens
one of the lysine execs enters
things are going well
whitacre conceals the recorder
want to get back in there
whitacre sits alone fully engrossed by the movie
tom cruise as mitch mcdeere talks with fbi agent wayne tarrance played by ed harris at a dogtrack
doesnt the dog ever get the bone
yeah i hear it happens every once in awhile
its a disaster they can never get that dog to run again
listen mitch mr
boyles wants me to tell you how much the bureau appreciates
a million dollars
a million dollars in a numbered account in switzerland
ibg bank international in zurich
you sure as hell turned greedy overnight
and my brother out now
your brother is a convicted felon mitch
then get yourself another snitch
tarrance responds with a string of expletives and threats to knock mcdeeres teeth down his throat
his verbal assault is put to a halt when his phone rings
its holly hunter calling from the nearby parking lot
she plays tarrance an incriminating tape of what he has just said
mcdeere is wearing a wire
mcdeere has him now
you want to reconsider
most of the guys the government gets to do the tough stuff are probably drug dealers and mafia guys
im probably the only guy like me theyve ever met whitacre drives his new range rover through the darkness
maybe theres some guy who spied on the russians and they had to put him in that witness protection unit
its just me and some russian guy whos now a girls soccer coach in new mexico or something
whitacre tries to creep into the dark room without waking his wife
he starts to get undressed
her voice in the darkness surprises him
were you with brian and bob all this time
yeah we had to go over some tapes and
mark brian called i know you werent with him
did you go again
i needed to unwind
youve seen that picture like five times now
she turns on the light to discuss her concerns
mark is standing there without his shirt on a large patch of hair is missing from the middle of his chest
whats wrong with that
why is your chest shaved mark
why are there holes cut in your suit clothes
why arent you a part of this family anymore
whitacre tries to laugh off her concern
he sits down on the bed and puts her hand on his smooth chest
you know they needed to shave me for the tape recorder
they needed to
im a part
i need you at home the kids need you to be their father
im doing all this for you and the kids
i didnt ask for this but i want to give this family everything
thats why im working so much
i dont know who you work for anymore mark
he smiles warmly at her
warm summer day out the window the smoke stacks of adm send plumes of white smoke into the blue sky
shepard and herndon sit in their shirtsleeves transcribing tapes in the tiny office
theres a knock on the door
shepard checks to see who it is through the eye hole
whitacre enters wearing the sage colored suit full of confidence
hey guys i was in the neighborhood
i got some more tapes
come on in
and ive learned some important things recently
ive been told im probably going to be the next president of adm
who told you that
and thats not all
id say that ten of the products produced by adm are price fixed
i would estimate that for all the companies involved the total extra profit is in the range of million to one billion dollars
thats just from the price fixing
can you tell us what products
whitacre smiles hes got something else on his mind
you know brian if all these companies are charged theyre going to be paying an awful lot in fines
dont you think
i dont know they might end up paying
but nobody knows for sure how this will turn out
we still need to get everyone together making an actual agreement before we have a case
sure sure i know that
but ive taken a lot of risks and i need to think about my family
what do you mean
well id like it if in their fine adm was ordered to pay me ten years salary
its only fair
also one other thing
i never expected this investigation would go on as long as it has
its been almost two years and i think i should get total immunity if i agree to cooperate through the end
i cant grant you immunity mark you know that
whitacre smiles wishfully like a big kid
herndon senses that somethings up
hey mark its kind of warm in here why dont you take off your jacket sit down and we can talk about this
oh no bob thats okay
let me know if you want to reconsider
herndon looks at shepard
what was that about
whitacre labels the tape of the fbi agents and tosses it in a box with other tapes
these floods out on the mississippi you have to think about these
it just looks like some boy scouts and sand bags on the news right until you have your stock plummet because of crop losses
then it looks like someones knee deep in your kids college education looking for their photo albums
brian doesnt understand stock options
he doesnt see what can happen if they take those away from me
ginger alone in bed at am during a rain storm
the regular patter of rain is punctuated by the sound of a small engine
she gets out of bed and goes to the window
whitacre stands in his bathrobe in the rain with the leaf blower
theres one wet leaf stuck to the pavement and hes focussed the full power of the blower on it but its not going anywhere
three deer stand like statues in the yard oblivious to the rain
we got a deer problem here
theyre in the corn theyre eating the small trees they charge into the road
too many deer
take away all the predators and thats going to happen
no bears no coyotes
so now you have all these deer weak and desperate
close enough to hear the rain on their metal bodies
they are yard statues
and then one gets sick and they all get sick
because theyre broke and hungry and they make mistakes
whos fault is that
you cant blame the deer for not having predators
ginger approaches in her night gown under an umbrella
mark what are you doing
whitacre cant tear himself away from the lone leaf
come inside mark whats happening to you
she takes his arm and tries to lead him toward the house but he turns on her
his eyes are filled with terror
she turns off the blower
you want to be someone living in some small house
you want to be like those people who cant afford cars for their kids
youre not better than somebody else because you have more cars or a bigger salary
or some stables across the road
you used to know that you used to know what mattered
you need to find that out again you need to turn to god
whitacre stares at the leaf trying to move it with his will
softly so god wont hear i dont need god
whitacre flags down kirk schmidt a co worker and a friend who is passing by
hey kirk im gonna be heading off to europe and i was thinking id deliver the check for the abp deal in person
remind me abp deal
threonine microbe theyve made some substantial improvements and we need to get it into the market
i got the invoice somewhere
he fishes it out of a pile of papers and slides it across the desk
we can overnight it
nah im gonna see this thorstensson guy
ill just hand it to him
then ill get it over
lysines going great guns mark price is up to one twenty
out the window of the office andreas looks at the tote board and smiles broadly he gives whitacre a big thumbs up
whitacre smiles and flashes a thumbs up back
whitacre emerges from the elegant hotel and heads down the crowded bahnhofstrasse
adm supermarket to the world
well have to change that
when it all comes out maybe the board want to change the name of the company altogether
like when all those companies became beatrice in the s
there was that woman were beatrice
they made light bulbs and corn and everything
whitacre enters the swiss bank corporation
he approaches a guten morgen ich mochte herr brief finden bitte
the porter points toward a desk
whitacre approaches a secretary
behind him another woman shrieks and falls down
the heel has broken on her shoe
her papers scatter everywhere the secretary smirks at the guten tag
wie gehts es they have a word for laughing ihnen
ich suche herr briel at the misfortune of others
a word for that
we dont have any words for that kind of thing
in a way its not really funny
the secretary buzzes and moments later a wooden door opens
daniel briel emerges smiling
gut dass wir uns eben getroffen haben
the two men vanish behind a door
brian and bob always ask me if i do much sightseeing on business trips they dont understand
contd you fly in go to the meeting go to the hotel go to another meeting and get back on the plane
its not that glamorous
whitacre hands another small stack of tapes to shepard and herndon the agents are very excited whitacre has good news
were having another association meeting to work out some issues in lysine dividing up volume setting prices for some markets
theres a price fixing investigation into cement manufacturing there it has everybody spooked
we cant video tape in japan thats not gonna help us
whats his name mimoto we have him saying on tape last fall that
he checks a three ring note book full of transcriptions
they were concerned about severe penalties for anti trust in the us
whitacre smiles very impressed with himself
so why are they coming to the us
i got the association past their fears
crushed by a driver the grass and tee fly
the state bird of hawaii is the nay nay its a kind of land based goose and the state motto is va mau ke ea o ka aina i ka
pono the customer is the enemy and the competitor is your friend
mimoto ikeda whitacre wilson and another foursome of asian lysine execs crowd around a tee box in their golf clothes
mimoto watches his drive split the palm lined fairway and head toward the pacific
wilson tees up his ball
what should we play for
if we win we get tyson foods
all the execs laugh at the thought of dividing up the worlds lysine market through golf
an exec in a visor chimes in
or we could play a thousand tons a stroke
we already know whitacres score sixty seven plus alpha
i got a hole in one once back in ohio when i was about eighteen
there was a little blurb in the paper and i won a windbreaker from the country club
i still have the news clipping somewhere stashed away for safe keeping
a series of photographs are snapped of the golfers
herndon and shepard snap photographs with a very long lens from a golf cart parked on hillside
but mainly i was active in the local h club
i think h is a real good thing for kids
i got a lot of recognition from them and its not just some local thing
its a federal program part of the department of agriculture
other fbi agents dressed for the links shadow the lysine execs using long range recording equipment
herndon and whitacre like a boxer and his corner man
just remember i want you to poll the room and get them to use the word agreement
its gonna be a great meeting
let the action come to you
i gotta talk bob
i know that
i mean im representing adm
otherwise everybody would be suspicious
you can talk
just dont dominate
we want to see others involvement
its that time again
oh sure no problem
whitacre takes off his shirt as the two men face each other in the hotel room an uncomfortable moment
herndon starts spreading shave cream across whitacres chest
when its over i think well be friends all of us
ill have bob over and brian and well bar b que
maybe not so much with some of the guys over at adm probably not mick and terry
but guys like sid and marty and rheinhard weve been through a lot together
wilson mimoto ikeda and visor sip umbrella drinks we cant be manipulated by these goddamn buyers
thank god we have them but they are not my friends
the men all nod
whitacre appears pool side and begins to unbutton his hawaiian shirt
wilson turns to ikeda
youre my friend
i want to be closer to you than i am to any customer cause you can make it so i can make money or i cant make money
and all i want
nobody is listening to him
they all stare at whitacre
whitacre looks down at his chest so does everyone else
whitacres got some explaining to do
nah i had to take this physical for some life insurance the wife wanted
they shaved me for the heart thing
whitacre smiles shyly and settles into the pool
its not really lying when youre doing it to serve some greater purpose
i think thats what god would say its not all cut and dry like that and you cant really send a lie out into the world on its own you
wouldnt do that with a child per se
a lie needs the company of other lies and so it may look like a lot of lies in the end but its really just the first one that counts
a medium sized room overlooking the grounds
orange juice and fruit trays and an easel in the corner
the room seems a little cramped for the number of men assembling whitacre wilson mimoto ikeda and a number of others from asia and europe
whitacre searches for something
damn mark cant you call and get us a bigger room
this is crazy
anyone seen my briefcase
we move to bigger room
they start to pack up their stuff
i dont think they have one
is my brief case behind the flip chart
herndon enters with the brief case shepard is watching whitacre on a monitor with other junior agents
he left it in his room
ia whitacre on the phone
yeah its just theres more of us than we expected
can you check again
whitacres finger holds down the receiver switch
hes talking to no one
mimoto picks up his chair and moves it right in front of the lamp camera
call us if anything opens up
its whitacre mark whitacre
he hangs up and crosses toward mimoto
mimoto i think you might be able to see the easel better
you think mimoto would be any different in my position
they have guys filing expense reports for sex trips to bangkok at ajinomoto corporation
any of these guys who have kids and found themselves in a bind with the authorities
a suite down the hall
shepard stares at the back of mimotos chair on the monitor
theyve come a long way to go back empty handed
suddenly the room comes into view as whitacre moves the chair from in front of the lamp camera
on the monitor what if we just move your chair over here
thatta boy mark
terry wilson starts the meeting
id like to welcome everybody here glad everyone could make it and sorry for those who cant play golf tomorrow were gonna have a good time
whitacres pov he scans the room
we have an old saying at adm its like that game on tv that applies here
its where one guy knows a word better to have the elephants and tries to make the other inside the tent pissin out one say it
another word for than outside pissin in
how about consensus or understanding
maybe theyd take deal thats like agreement
language problem again
its better to be part of the group
competitors are our friends remember
customers the enemy
the group nods in agreement with whitacres translation
jm suh of cheil corporation takes issue with this
the two argue
whitacre looks at suh who is losing his hair
i want to know why cheil male pattern hair loss can be corporation has been excluded a real set back
i mean a from association in the past
lot of women their fathers are bald so theyre kind of used to it
but still seeing it in the drain every morning in your thirties thats not fair at all and this minoxidil thing its not really a cure
i explain it to you on the phone many times
suh is kind of a baby mimoto doesnt like him
wilson steps in
if the market is what we think it is
theres a knock on the door
we have a couple other people joining us i think
chaudret from eurolysine is making himself a fruit plate
from sewon in korea
and one from the fbi
he looks at the business men
do they all know
thats why there cant be any leaves on the walk
they give it away like the ants they can see a trail of ants
mimoto smiles right at whitacre the walls close in and then the room bursts into laughter
whitacre gets it
he smiles back
and seven from the federal trade commission
its all a joke
more laughter and more knocks
whitacre goes to the door
mimoto calls out
whitacre opens the door to find herndon dressed like a hotel employee he hands whitacre the brief case
this was left in the lobby
the concierge thought it might belong to one of you gentleman
herndon closes the door
you forgot your briefcase in the lobby
when i was signing for the food i mustve left it
in paris it would have already been sold
how can we know adm will stay at agreed upon levels
our preference is to trust each other
if we find someone lyin then we hire some mafia figure and rub you out
the group laughs
if we cant trust each other in the end it aint gonna work
you are okay for that
yeah im all right
so what are we saying then
wilson looks at whitacre like hes an idiot
what is there a language problem here
so everyone is uh
they just said so
its like whitacre is playing password
uh five companies agree on quantity for the first time
the men all smile at each other hand shakes and high fives
shepard and herndon have been playing the new tape for robin mann and us antitrust attorney james mutchnik
shepard and herndon beam with pride
you heard it
he hits rewind and plays it again
a jurys gonna love that
christ how about this guy whitacre
whats his story
what do you mean
whats his agenda
the guys making grand a year hes moving up the ladder and he turns informer
when does that happen
is the money going up his nose
some woman somewhere with a kid that hes seeing on one of these business trips
whats his story
shepard and herndon are offended on behalf of mark
herndon reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a greeting card
i wanted everyone to see this
this is mark whitacre and his family
the group passes it around
a photo of whitacre family smiling in front of their christmas tree
i carry this picture with me all the time as a constant reminder that he is a real person with a real family depending on him
the only reason we have these tapes is because of this man
we want to know that when the time comes if he loses his job the government is going to stand behind him
whats he looking for
about eighteen grand a month
he hands her a folder of whitacres expenses
whitacre rides down the shoulder of the two lane past the towers of the grain elevators to a railroad crossing and rumbling out of the darkness comes another box cars
of what america needs for tomorrow and each one of those cars says adm
we took the kids one year to the renaissance festival in indiana
you get to be the white knight
the kids get to ride in the joust against the forces of darkness with a helmet on
and the white knight always wins the forces of darkness fall onto an old mattress
it was maybe ninety degrees out and the heat and humidity index i cant even remember what the radio said
ginger lies alone in bed eyes open train whistles in the night
we were next in line and the mare collapsed went down in a heap
ginger was eating ye olde drumstick and she dropped it in the dirt
the kids were crying and i remember this farmer saying he had a gun in his truck
just like that
from the white knight to a gun in the truck how do you get that back
how does that get to be fair
whitacre pulls into the parking lot in a brand new porsche
shepard gets out of a black sedan and crosses the lot
he climbs into the shiny red car
off the porsche hey brian how do you like it
shepard takes in the car
its a beauty
how was hong kong
real good were going to be taking the lysine prices up again
he hands shepard an envelope
were gonna wanna hear how the company responds when we move in
shepard hands him some tapes and batteries
he grabs the brief case off the backseat
you want me to load you up right now
thats okay brian
its kind of packed with work anyway
whitacre stops shepard from opening the case he takes the tapes and puts them in his lap
ill see you at the briefing
whitacre watches shepard walk away then opens the briefcase
its filled with tens of thousands in cash
marty allison sid hulse and the other guys will understand theyve worked with me
contd they saw what i was trying to do for everyone
those guys know me theyd back me up all the way family and friends are the most important thing
thats the lesson
whitacre picks a tie to go with his tape recorder suit
he sees good things on the horizon
but gingers got another point of view
mark are you an idiot
im gonna be the only one left
dwayne will be gone
mick will be gone
terry will be gone
im going to be the only one who can run adm
thats totally illogical
how can you possibly stay there when youve dust taken down the company
you think theyre going to pat you on the back
im next in line
its the fbi right
theyre brainwashing you
brian shepard put these ideas in your head to keep you working for him
she storms out whitacre checks his hair in the mirror
im telling you theyre gonna make me president
hows your family doing
shepard herndon whitacre mann mutchnik and a host of other agents prepare for the raid
the cheap hotel room has been transformed into a command center
theres a map of decatur on the wall with push pins at various locations and a chart of which agent will contact which adm executive
theyll be at an amusement park when you guys make your move
whatever happens tomorrow it may be in your best interest to get an attorney who represents your interests alone
whitacre is confused
you want me to go and hire an attorney now
no not now
the first thing thats going to happen is the company lawyers are going to come to all the executives with a list of attorneys for you to pick from
you gotta understand these attorneys are being paid by adm
they dont represent you
do not take one of these attorneys thats when you say to them that you have your own attorney
tell them youve decided to cooperate with the government
its perfectly reasonable for you to cooperate
it happens all the time
well i know a lawyer in decatur
the towns too small
im sure youve met lawyers in your business dealings who can handle this
he searches his mind for who that might be
now mark once this thing starts its going to be intense
theyre going to know that somebody was on the inside working with us
theyre going to do almost anything to find out who it is
you guys still think everything will work out okay for me at the company
theyll take out the bad guys but ill be okay
mauve covered tables patrolled by bow tied wait staff
wood paneling botanical drawings of the illinois state flowers on the wall serrated steak knives on the table
whitacre and wilson dine with a visiting client
theyre a couple of cocktails into the swagger of american business
come on mark youre making that up
no its true
archer the a in adm choked to death on a chicken bone in
there you have it from mark whitacre ph
you know what the ph
piled higher and deeper
and let me guess daniels was killed by a pig and the cows got midland
booze soaked laughter all around
at the hostess stand whispering the hostess drops her menus
so a chicken got archer but fifty years later when you look at our deals with tyson foster farms whats the body count
the agents walk up to the table
whitacre im bob herndon and im an fbi agent
this is special agent shepherd
jesus what is it
whats whats this about
why dont we step over there
wilson is baffled
whitacre feigns surprise they both look to their client
i have no idea what this is
wilson gets up from the table
whitacre is shaken
do i need an attorney
whitacre if i can ask you to step outside with agent shepard and mr
wilson if you could have a seat
the men move away from the table leaving the visiting client baffled and all alone a stunned waitress approaches him
would you like to see the dessert menu
shepard and whitacre descend the steps of the club and head for the fbi cruiser
i saved a guy once at a restaurant in hong kong
he was choking on a bone and i got him to throw himself over the back of his chair
he sends me cards on holidays
just to say thanks
tells me what his kids are studying
he remembers me
herndon and wilson
you have a reason for embarrassing my colleague and i in front of a business prospect
wilson youre president over at archer daniels midland corporation correct
i run the corn business
this is a serious matter
it involves an international investigation into price fixing
shepard and whitacre
why dont we talk in the car
herndon and wilson
weve seen you and your boss mick andreas conspire with your competitors to fix prices
weve seen you tell others to do it
fbi agents flash badges and warrants to a night security guard and fan out down the corridors entering offices seizing documents
there are going to be indictments
search warrants have been issued
fbi agents roll up the drive way and approach a middle aged man watering his plants
and some people people you know and work with will be going to jail
the middle aged man drops the hose and goes inside with the fbi agent
pull back to reveal two other houses on the street have fbi cruisers parked in their driveways
were giving you a chance
wilson sits motionless cradling his high ball
out the window whitacre and shepard are just shapes in the dodge
a chance to be able to look your grandchildren in the eye someday and tell them you did the right thing
wilson looks out the window and sees whitacre in the fbi cruiser
whitacre and shepard watch herndon and wilson in the foyer
whitacre is in the middle of an adrenaline rush two and a half years in the making
look at that look at bob and terry
man id love to be a fly on the wall for that one
i was good wasnt i
i seemed scared
shepard tries to calm him down get him to focus
remember what we told you mark tell them that youre cooperating first thing and whatever you do do not take one of their lawyers
whitacre and wilson
whitacre is in a feigned panic
what did you say to your guy
i told him nothing
he said he had tapes that hed heard price fixing tapes
what the fuck is that
i cant believe they would pull this shit on dwayne andreas
the car skids into a turn up a very long drive toward the kind of mansion that comes from price fixing
i bet they tapped the phones i always said that about them
i bet its phone calls
maybe but whats that
you know i get phone calls from time to time terry
i know i know
terry never liked me
hes a dinosaur
the andreas bully is all he ever was
he was never going to run the place
those guys never do they just use them to find the land mines
mick andreas mid s appears in the headlights shirt un tucked holding a drink
gnats swarm around the yard lights crickets chirp out the temperature
were going to the lawyers i dont want to use the phones
see the phones
they hit everyone my dad schmidt randall
they played me a tape of me some meeting with the fucking japs
i called the lawyers
they want us to go there
they played a fucking tape
i really dont think theyve got that much and when you factor in everything weve ever done for them itll be a ten year thing for the lawyers then therell
be some deal maybe a fine
thats all itll ever be
wilson and andreas get in one car whitacre gets in another
mick shouldve been more of a friend to me
contd taken me into his confidence more just about different kinds of things
i couldve kept some of the tapes out of it
the ones about girls or whatever those are gonna be tough to hear on the nightly news
the small room is abuzz with agents reporting in
a successful raid
i couldve turned the tape recorder off and told brian and bob i ran out of batteries
do you think it went well
i dont think i would change a thing
a phone rings somewhere an agent answers
i got agent temples for attorney mutchnik
mutchnik sharing in the joy of the success takes the phone
they wouldve believed me
brian and bob really trusted me
agent temples sits in his car outside the house on his cell phone
i just interviewed an adm employee kirk schmidt
schmidt knew we were coming
he said whitacre told him about the raid days ago
mutchnik hangs up the phone
one unhappy guy in the midst of a lot of law enforcement back patting
he turns to shepard and herndon
bob brian can i talk to you guys for a second
whitacre listens to the farm report on wsoy as he heads down highway
he turns into the holiday inn and parks next to the tennis courts behind the hotel a liter bottle of coke rolls around in the wind
the metric system never panned out
we all had rulers with inches on one edge and centimeters on the other i pronounced it centimiters instead of centimeeters and nobody ever corrected me
they just let me walk around stupid so im not really upset we never crossed over although its helpful in europe
the liter bottle is the only thing that ever caught on because its a nicer word liter than quart
a sedan pulls up next to him
herndon and shepard climb in
you guys were great
i mean you scared the hell out of terry and you shouldve seen mick and the lawyers
thats super mark
and the best part is they think you gave me the once over
did you make a tape
whitacre again reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small tape recorder
yeah and its good stuff
its real good
he hands the agents the tape
so its pretty much over now
whitacre nods a moment to savor until
mark who did you tell
what do you mean
who did you tell about the raid
shepard is furious he glares at whitacre
hey i had to tell my secretary
i told her a long time ago
i just said look im working with the fbi on some things i may be out of touch for a while
shepard still glares
and uh ive probably mentioned kathy dougherty in my division
shes a dear friend and a trusted ally
i didnt want her to be scared
why did you do that mark
why did you tell dougherty
like i said i didnt want her to be scared
and i can trust her
guys i can trust her
shepard glares in harder his voice cracking
i wanted to let him know it was okay to talk with you cuz he might not on account of hes loyal to me
you could have ruined this entire operation
two and a half years
mark you know what you did was wrong in our eyes
whitacre starts to speak
look we can get past this
but is there anything else we need to know
whitacre regains his composure
no i cant think of anything bob
whitacre strolls through the lobby amazed at the mayhem hes created
documents are being carted away by the arm load
secretarys make frantic phone calls to lawyers
selenium deficiency in chicks causes reduced growth and pancreatic atrophy and increased mortality
but does anyone here know that
its in my ph
you can solve it with vitamin e
mick and terry most of the people they dont even have ph
they wouldnt have the slightest idea about what selenium deficiency can do to a chick
but i know it i did the research
a small smile of accomplishment
whitacre sits in his office
from his pov he can see the great and powerful dwayne andreas mick and terry cross the chaotic trading area toward his office with them are two starched and suited
older men who can only be a lawyers aubrey daniel and john dowd
dwayne andreas hey how ya doin
sorry about the fbi arresting your son and investigating your company
maybe you all shouldve listened to me
the smile vanishes
is he found out
mark whitacre this is aubrey daniel
pleasure meeting you
im representing adm in this matter
and this is a colleague of mine john dowd
dwaynes told me about your responsibilities here
they shake hands
aubrey defended lt
calley after the my lai massacre in viet nam
so this ought to be a cake walk for him
we thought you might take some time and talk to john here
adms going to stand behind you on this mark
dad and i want the key people to know well be paying their legal fees
great thats great
then well let you fellas get acquainted
everyone leaves except for dowd and whitacre
dowd gives whitacre a warm knowing look
how you holding up mark
uh can i ask you something
if i tell you something are you allowed to say anything to mick or dwayne
from the trading floor
dowd gets up and pulls the curtains shut
through a crack in the drapes we see whitacre and dowd talk
it feels good to talk to clear the air you get to be like a balloon after a while
a balloon looking for a pin to bump into and relieve the pressure
you could get sick from keeping it inside and get a tumor or something
i didnt ask for that
why should i pay for my own legal fees when im not the one who started the price fixing
herndon and shepard stand over a similar sea of documents exhausted
people get their lives earnings wiped out by these legal entanglements
im gonna pay for that
thats not right i have kids and ginger and horses
from the parking lot you can see two men still talking in the fluorescent light of whitacres office
i have a friend from school who has a law practice and hes always telling me how they cant talk about their cases like in the firm
you can tell them anything and they have to keep to themselves or they get in a lot of trouble theyre boxed
thats what they say boxed
a group of lawyers sit among boxes of pizza and beer
the drapes finally open in whitacres office
dowd and whitacre emerge
dowd looks stunned whitacre solemn
wilson daniel mick and the other lawyers stop what their doing and look up
i need to tell you that im cooperating with the government
the fbi has hundreds of tapes
they know all about lysine
john here agrees i should be getting another lawyer
no question about it
dowd and daniel share a knowing look
an uncomfortable silence follows
im sorry for whats happened
whitacre shakes mick andreas hand and walks away
the men are all stunned they watch him leave
john i bet that sob was wearing a wire on you tonight too
whitacre crosses the room the object of cold stares and hard silence
to nobody in particular and nobody responds
he enters his office and closes the drapes
there are perfectly good ties on sale and nobody is buying them
paisleys and yellow and red rep ones with little crests and what have you
two for one
you just have to take the time and look there are plenty of good ones
but when he looks up aubrey daniel is standing there all arrogance and anger concentrated into a very intense beam of language
mark wed like you off the premises
daniel cant we
management wants you out
but im a vp here
and with that mark cheviron picks up his briefcase and car keys
seen through the front window of a car baring down on them as they work on an old ford mustang mach one
shepard reacts to the camera he cant believe what he sees
bitter little boy rant how would brian shepard like it if he was thrown out of his job
if he was humiliated in front of his secretary
if he even had a secretary
not very much im willing to wager
contd its like hey mark well lead the parade in these bright red suits while you walk behind the elephants with a shovel and some rubber gloves in case it
a modest midwestern home on a tree lined street
whitacre brings his town car to a screeching halt in front of shepard
mark you cant be here
they threw me out brian
youre jeopardizing everything
tossed me out of adm
shepard backs away from whitacre like hes a leper
not here mark on the phone we can set something up
you gotta help me
whitacre looks around all the houses have eyes
a little neighbor boy has stopped playing catch with his mother and both are now staring at whitacre and shepard as are a group of city workers fixing a telephone
if you need to talk call me
whitacre gets back in his car
shepard watches him drive away over his shoulder we hear the phone ringing
whitacre parks at the far end of the street
whitacre is freaked out
mark you cant show up at my house
how can you know me if this is a secret investigation
they know its me my lawyer told them
i fired him right away but he told mick and dwayne
shepard paces the kitchen staring out the window at whitacre who is parked down the street
a lawyer cant do that mark
i thought that i did
mick and dwayne introduced me to this guy and i told him
who introduced you
mick and dwayne said they were going to take care of me
shepard cant believe whitacre gave himself away
mark we told you not to talk to an adm lawyer
we went over that more than once
i think we made it very clear
i know i know i do
i just dont know one
let me make a call
youre not mad at me for coming over are you bri
jim epstein and bob zaideman sit with mark whitacre in their offices in the loop
whitacre recounts his life as a mole in a rambling fashion leaping tangent to tangent
so there wasnt a saboteur in the beginning at all
you made that up
maybe there was there couldve been adm steals technology from the japanese so i wouldnt put it past the japanese to do the same thing
but after i told them that i made it up the fbi said i didnt have much of a choice
and you began making tapes
how many tapes did you make
whitacre again displays his gift to move his lips and mind in different directions
the interior monologue takes precedence the on camera story weve heard before
there are over tapes
i there are so many really nice carried a tape recorder people in the world
people almost everyday to work once who want to help out
good i signed a cooperating neighbors
witness agreement and then like when they have these they gave me a special brief floods out on the mississippi case that i took to meetings and people lose everything
that had a hidden recorder in and are sleeping in a school it they even sewed a small gym someone always shows up one they just developed into with a warm coat for the old my suit and id ride around people and a home made pot on the plane and tape mick roast
thats why ginger and and the guys talking about i bought that girl in town a price fixing or stealing special computer after she technology and illegal had the spine
that campaign contributions just kind of thing really makes a whatever wed talk about
jim here strikes made over a hundred tapes me as that kind of guy you and brian and bob and i would can tell hes the one in a get
together a couple times a hundred guy who when you come week and work on the into the emergency room you investigation until we thank your lucky stars that briefed the lawyers at the its his watch
department of justice and they raided the place
epstein cant believe it
for how long did you do this
work as an informant
uh two and a half years
i was a vp and a cooperating witness
a moment of reflection and then
ive always thought when this was over thered still be a place for me at adm
i still got a lot of friends there
the lawyers look at each other
mark its very important to your case that you not discuss it with anyone else
these people you work with your friends they could end up being witnesses
so bob and i are the only people i want you to talk to about this from now on and i want you to know you can tell us anything
hey thanks for taking the time
i really appreciate it
i feel a whole lot better
epstein and zaideman try and absorb what theyve just heard
then they burst into hysterical laughter
as seen from across the street
a stranger scott kilman is standing on the steps
hes out of town
my name is scott kilman and im a reporter from the wall street journal
kilman gives her a business card
hiding in the corn
he inspects an ear
any kind of corn will pop but not every kind turns itself inside out and gets white and fluffy
i know this is a difficult time for your family
but ive seen how these things go before these companies really go after the whistle blowers
kilman lays out what he knows for ginger
she listens briefly and then walks kilman back to his car
theyve got a whole pr theres a starch protein department putting out their matrix
certain ratios prove side
its just the nature of advantageous
how do you the beast
if he wants his explain that
who would side coming out hes gonna really take the time to have to do it
listen when the other guys have an agenda
when they can get ronald reagan on the phone because theyre building a statue of him
uh well i dont really know about all that like i said marks away just now but ill let him know you stopped by
ginger watches kilman drive away and then turns and walks toward the stables
you can come back
whitacre emerges from among the tall stalks of corn where hes been watching
whitacre is strung out on martyrdom and insomnia
he stares at his coffee
they turned the place upside down
his loyal secretary gives him a pile of mail
they went though all of this too
im sorry you got dragged into this
and then they started asking me for the access code to your voice mail
did you tell them
i dont think you have to tell them that
well according to them i do but i didnt
and about two hours later peterson told me to clean out my desk
he said ive been transferred out of bioproducts
but you didnt tell them
whitacre is parked in his mercedes across the road staring through the chain link fence
trucks rumble by
abe lincoln was born minutes from here and ive never been to his log cabin
ive seen post cards and i sent the kids there on a field trip
but ive never gone
im sure its very well preserved
original beds and dining room tables and the doorways are probably smaller from when people were shorter
its only minutes away
cu on whitacre as a sound builds in the car
a small outboard motor weve heard before
and then a voice competes
whitacre stands with the leaf blower but the driveway is spotless
he shuts it off
behind him is scott kilman
id like to talk to you about whats been going on at adm
he hands whitacre a card
im interested in hearing your side of things
whitacre takes a paranoid look around
we better go inside
we cant talk out here
whitacre makes himself a bowl of cereal and talks on the phone
hes fully caffeinated and ready to go
they kept coming back brian and they only had adms side of things
did you talk to them mark
what did you say
its real important that you not talk to the press
i told him i had no comment
but they already had the story
on the counter is a newspaper
whitacre hangs up the phone
headline seeds of doubt an executive becomes informant for i dont owe brian shepard the truth
contd i mean i gave brian shepard two c and a half years of my life and now i have legal bills to show for it
and im the good guy in all this the guy who took on adm
jim epstein reads the journal
pull back to reveal its in the hands of almost every other executive on the train
is brian shepard gonna lose his job for that
his standard of living
ive gone to the local junior high school on career day and talked to kids about biochemistry and the kind of career opportunities available
whitacres son alexander runs screaming into the kitchen
can brian shepard and bob herndon say that im the white hat
dad dad youre on tv
whitacre turns on the tv
a strange light blows out the windows of the kitchen
on the tv screen appears the image of whitacres house
a vice president in the bio products division of fortune five hundred adm whitacre was working as a spy for the fbi for over two years
i did enough for brain shepard
whos gonna take care of me
baby you gotta come see this were on tv
a crowd of reporters and eng crews have sprouted up among the corn fields
they press in on the gates
america has questions for mark whitacre
the door opens and whitacre emerges
expecting rock star exaltation he gets something else
any comment on the effect your actions have had on the decline in adms stock prices
what has been the reaction of your friends and co workers to having been taped without their knowledge
whitacre picks up speed toward the garage
do you believe you and your family can safely stay in decatur or has the government made arrangements to move you
whitacre cowers in the garage
who picks the kids up for swimming lessons
who has a plaque in the high school for the mark whitacre environmental award
where are your friends when its dump on mark whitacre wheres the pot roast and the warm coat
ginger with shepard and herndon
were still getting the threatening phone calls and i know for a fact that dwayne and terry have been telling people he wasnt a good worker
that he cant be trusted
we told mark that he had to expect the unexpected that he might be attacked that he wasnt going to win any popularity contests for this
he just mopes around here watching the news looking for a glimpse of himself
or he calls someone from adm looking for the latest gossip
whitacre gets out of the car with a brief case and heads into the hotel
maybe you guys should get out of town until the hearings start
hes got to stop talking to people that can really come back to bite him
hes very proud you know
whitacre fixes his hair and smiles
a camera flashes
i just feel that after everything hes done he should be taken better care of
where is he now
he said he was going to see you
a camera flash punctuates his words as whitacres story pours itself into ronald henkoffs tape recorder
they had warned me that i would need an attorney and told me not to get one tied to adm but they didnt stress it
i spent from six to ten that night talking to john dowd the attorney from adm
dowd promised me he wouldnt tell anyone my role
but the next day someone at adm called me and said hey dwayne told me youre the mole
youre the one who caused all this
and then what happened
whitacres story comes out in both directions
its been pure hell ever a lot of people didnt since
i really believed i believe id ever go to an ivy was doing a good deed
i league school but i did
still think that
i wont they didnt believe id get a ever regret that part
but i did that too
still think i did a good maybe cornell isnt harvard thing
just a few weeks ago but they play each other in i was potentially the next sports
when i was twenty president of the company
i eight i wanted to be making have that on tape and now twice my age and i did
its pure character then the goal was three times assasination
heres whats my age by the time i was being said about me at adm
im and im making that i wasnt a good manager well over ten times my age that i wasnt good with and ill be on the cover of people
that the feds caught fortune magazine for cleaning me at price fixing
up one of the biggest companies in america
and i was just an average student in high school
i never dreamed of being a whistle blower
and i would tell other people in this kind of situation to take a stand
try to solve the problem internally
go to the top
if that doesnt work go to the authorities
scott roberts an adm attorney thumbs through records
hes examining a file entitled abp international
the bottom line is that i know my story will eventually be confirmed by the fbi
theres no reason for me to put out a story theyre not going to confirm
it would be crazy
contracts citing various sums of money and photo copies of checks
its all on tape everything that happened
mick dwayne roberts and aubrey daniel stand before the window
the pages are taped to the window
the two signatures eclipse each other perfectly
you can see where he pasted it
aubrey daniel picks up the phone barely able to contain his glee
whitacre races the ferrari down a two lane in the middle of the farm fields of south central illinois
the phone rings and he answers cheerfully
its aubrey daniel
i think you forgot something
whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder
he looks at the cell phone in dismay and stares at a polaroid of himself from the fortune magazine photo shoot hes smiling in the picture
one of the things ive learned in business is that you should always use a persons name in conversation if you want them to feel important
sid hulse and marty allison think that and theyre very successful salesman
whitacre gets out of an fbi cruiser with herndon and shepard and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural illinois
it makes people feel like theyre definitely being told something they can use
they enter and the hostess gives them a table up front
you got anything open in the back
just by putting their name in there at the beginning or the end
the men sit at a table in the back
brian bob my attorneys telling me not to say anything but theres something ive wanted to talk about for awhile
dont tell us anything
you have an attorney now
this isnt like before
lets just talk
shepard tries to change the subject
you been playing any golf
whitacre doesnt want to just talk
they want to talk to me at adm
mark you understand your lawyer has advised you not to discuss this matter
were not asking you
let me throw out some hypotheticals
ill talk about some financial situations and you tell me if theyre wrong or how serious they might be ok
for instance suppose a company gave an executive a car you know a corporate car
but instead of driving it to work he drove his personal car and gave the company car to his daughter
would that be a problem
thats the hypothetical
the agents try not to laugh
after what whitacre has given the government a little undeclared perk is nothing
that shouldnt be a problem
what about if an executive used a corporate plane for personal use
basically its the same thing
there may be some irs issues but
what if hypothetically the activity involved kickbacks by corporate executives
there are plenty of ways companies try and attract business
dinners for clients tickets for sporting events
its not ethical but its done
then whitacre goes on
uh is this conversation on or off the record
what if the company regularly accepted kickbacks to executives in the form of cash
shepard drops his fork
hold on shepard
how much money are we talking about mark
whitacre pauses clears his throat
five hundred thousand
whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just crapped on the rug
its how things were done there
when did this start mark
shepard cant believe it
and how were you paid
they were deposited in various accounts
and always under dollars
and did any of these checks come in after we met
maybe a couple
the agents try and control their anger
who else knows about this
herndon loses it
come on mark you just said its how things were done at adm
now is there anything else youre involved in
anything else you need to tell us
just what i told you
im asking you one more time
the and thats it
he asks hopefully
this isnt going to affect the price fixing case is it
the three men get up to leave
i feel good about that
hey i dont see what the big deal is
they said help us with the price fixing and i did the two things are totally unrelated
aubrey daniel and a phalanx of a lawyers ascend the steps of besides mick knew about it definitely
hes the one who taught me to do it in the first place
aubrey daniel and a cadre of corporate attorneys sit at a conference table with mann mutchnik and u
attorney general gary spratling
an overhead projector displays the forged contracts on the wall
when you look at what went on with all the price fixing they did or the federal building being bombed in oklahoma city why are we focusing on me getting
a half million in kick backs along with everyone else
two point five million dollars
deposited in a bank in switzerland while mark whitacre was on adm business
we have sworn testimony from mr
lennart thorstensson of the abp corporation that hes never seen this contract before and that his signature has been forged
he and his company never received this check
as daniel speaks one of the younger lawyers passes out a folder of affidavits and other documents supporting his claims
it is clear to us that mark whitacre driven by his own boundless ambition to take over adm has attempted to frame his superiors in a price fixing conspiracy of
his own invention so that he could seize control of the company
mann and mutchnik cant believe what theyre seeing in the black folders
his cooperation with the government is merely a smokescreen for his lying and stealing
we have additional information that we are prepared to share with attorney general reno that the money has been moved to an account in grand cayman with the full knowledge
and complicity of whitacres fbi partners
the doj lawyers stare at the table searching for the rest of their careers
the moon and the sun are up at the same time
whitacre is out with the leaf blower the driveway is spotless
the moon is up during the day
i wonder if theres a name for that
we dont have very many moons compared to other planets
what does jupiter have
they arent scientists mick and dwayne they dont have ph
but im the one having to pull my kids out of school for doing the right thing
shepard and herndon appear before their bosses paisley and medford
shepard is irate herndon is a little more circumspect
they need to dig deep then theyll find out how high it goes its there they just need to look and theyll see
what are they accusing me of
i want the specifics
are they saying im in cahoots with the guy
medford and paisley dont want to answer this
paragraph eight in our agreement with whitacre states that his actions are directly attributable to the fbi and the us
but how could we know what he was doing
he came to us
the question theyre asking isnt how could we know
its why didnt we know
the question is were they fixing prices
medford and paisley share a look
the investigation has shifted from adm to whitacre
of course adm decides whitacres a thief as soon as they find out hes working for us
whos counting the money over there if they can just lose
million dollars for a few years and then find it in a few hours
we gotta call mark
i dont want you doing that
shepard and herndon are confused
were taking you off
i thought the fbi never hung a witness out to dry
hes not a witness anymore hes a target
a sunday afternoon
epstein and zaideman try and get a hand on the scope of whitacres fraud
whitacre has shoe boxes of receipts and bank statements
i only kept a million and a half and mick knew about it he knew these things went on
they taught me how to do it
zaideman and epstein shake their heads
you cant bullshit these people tomorrow
who knows what they know
if were going in there we got to go in with the whole story
because the way it gets bad for you is if you tell them youre confessing and you dont
then you are sorely screwed
whitacre looks at his shoe box
this is everything jim what im telling you here
i looked everywhere for the bank statements and the records
this is every penny im not gonna hide anything from you guys
whitacre enters the building with epstein and zaideman
i was never really that good at chemistry in high school
so i kept taking it just to get good and wound up with so many chemistry credits i ended up going into bio chem
whitacre epstein and zaideman on the way into battle
whitacre is strangely placid
thats really the truth about that i wanted to be a veterinarian when i was kid i raised chickens and rabbits
biochem was my advisors idea
listen i havent been telling you the whole truth
ill clear it up in there today
epstein starts desperately hitting elevator buttons to stop the approaching doom
we got to get you out of here
but its too late the doors open
whitacre steps out
i want to tell them
hold on epstein
whitacre surrounded by epstein and zaideman who can only imagine which way their loose cannon will roll
across from the doj lawyers as far as the eye can see
whitacres conduct constitutes a breach of his agreement with the us government
he is no longer a cooperating witness
my client has given you years of his life clearly he made mistakes but he made your case
were not here to discuss the case against adm
ed herbst early s and mary spearing s take over they take no prisoners
whitacre my name is ed herbst and im with the fbi economic crimes unit
id like you to tell me when your criminal conduct at adm began
i learned how things were done there from mick andreas
hes the one who taught me how to use embezzlement and kickbacks to make money tax free
epstein tries to do some damage control
my client is
i know the frauds i committed are wrong and i accept responsibility for them
how did you receive the money
primarily by check
i deposited them in my bank account in decatur
this seems unlikely
spearing gets angry they paid kickbacks in checks
what company would pay kickbacks in checks
no one from the government has ever been aggressive toward whitacre before hes thrown
i dont really remember the exact name
something like agriconsulting and trading something like that
you dont remember the name of the company that paid you checks
ive got a lot going on in my life
its hard to remember
hey were coming to you guys
were cooperating here and were going to get the money back
epstein looks at whitacre this last part might be hard
this might help your memory
he slides the forged abp documents toward whitacre
where did you get that
these are adm records showing the forging of signatures
whitacre smiles and shakes his head
he sees the conspiracy plainly
see thats how they keep didnt these people see the people in the fold they firm or read the book
tell you to take the money its all there
everything and then they use it against they did to me they did to you if you talk
its how tom cruise
im not the one they control us
you gotta they should be mad at
realize who these people are
is there anything else you have a hard time remembering
whitacre looks at epstein
epstein shakes his head no but whitacre has other plans
i have a few other things to tell you about
there were some things i did in mexico
as whitacre spills his guts the lawyers look on in bewilderment
the man is unhinged
i raised white mice too
chickens and goats and white mice in little cages
they couldnt come in the house
i took care of them that was my job outside
one got in one time i dont know how and he was found dead by my mother
this had nothing to do with anything i had done he just had died and it was up to me to bring him back to life
i wanted to do the right thing and wear the white hat and thats why i tried to make it all right so he wouldnt have to be dead
all the things i did were for that but i couldnt
shepard herndon ginger and whitacre
mark looks used up his hair seems to be graying around the edges
in front of him are a pile of newspapers washington post wsj chicago tribune etc
each with a banner announcement of his sins
we cant see you anymore and if you call us and start to talk about it well have to hang up
you can talk to us about your feelings but thats it
shepard puts his coffee cup down near the newspapers
headline reads you dirty rat says decatur illinois whitacre nods he cant play with his friends any more
mark please understand
this isnt what we want
weve got no choice here
ill tell you what my frustration and anger is all coming from my work with you guys
i mean this stuff in the papers my kids read that
its all dump on mark whitacre
its not right
im harassed by the media and mick and terry are still going to work in the morning
remember mark we told you it was impossible to predict what would happen when the case went overt
and you never told us about the five million dollars you took
ginger has heard this before and cant hear it again
he worked for you for two and a half years he risked his career his home
and now you turn your back on him and leave us out here
but the damn has burst
the reason we came today is because we are concerned about your and marks well being
its important that you tell the people in washington everything tomorrow one hundred per cent
youd have nothing without him and you know it
hes just been used by the government and then thrown away cuz its a lot easier to go after mark whitacre than anyone named andreas
whitacre stares at the newspapers
i think a lot of people would come a lot of friends
and people would be surprised by just how many there are
even folks from adm
the news media would be there for sure
whitacre is sitting on the bed up and dressed when the alarm goes off
he lies across his wife on the bed more like a child than a husband
everything would come out
brian and bob would come and i bet one of them would say something about me
rheinhard would come up from mexico
sid or marty would tell people what kind of boss i was and how i always brought back presents
youll be ok here with your mom
ginger nods groggily
whitacre leaves the room grabbing a picture of his family from a bedside table
whitacre opens the garage door and we see the entire fleet of cars he has amassed million dollars buys a lot of steering wheels
ferrari range rover jeep etc
whitacre selects the bmw convertible
he gets in the car and puts his brief case in the seat next to him
he opens it and we see the contents hundreds of articles about whitacre
a scrapbook from a roller coaster ride
he starts the car and guns the engine
the beemer does not back up the garage door comes down
jesus died on a cross to save others from their sins
jesus was a hero
i know selfish suicide is forbidden in the bible
a group of lawyers sit at a table
a note is passed to robin mann
she reads it
whitacre will not be appearing today
agent dangelo gets a call on his cell phone at a departure gate
he turns to his partner agent basset
whitacres not coming
the phone rings shepard answers
however the bible makes it clear that you sacrifice yourself
rusty the gardener shows up for work
he gets out of his pick up and kicks a few leaves off the driveway he adds some chemicals to the pool and then walks toward the garage as hes
fishing some keys out of his pocket he notices the sound of a car engine
if its the only way to save your loved ones
the air is thick with smoke
whitacre is motionless sprawled in the backseat drenched in sweat clutching the picture of jesus no
rusty throws the car in reverse and pulls out
he opens an eye but as rusty looks down at him again he closes it plays dead
the car is outside now
rusty turns off the engine
whitacre sighs heavily
bud pull the car back into the garage
pull back in before somebody sees me
rusty pulls the car back in and turns it off
the smoke is still clearing
jesus mark what are you doing
whitacre still stretched out in the backseat stares up at the ceiling explodes
you fucking god
you owe me
you fucking god
after everything i did
rusty is shocked by the outburst this is not the guy he knows at all
he backs away from the car and picks up the garage phone
ginger can you come to the garage
rusty whats wrong
i just need to talk to you
im not coming down there unless you tell me whats wrong
mark just tried to kill himself and
gingers piercing scream comes down the phone line
whitacre is fetal in the backseat moaning
ginger and her mother come flying out of the house screaming
they pull mark out of the car toward the open air as he stumbles coughing the family picture clatters across the garage floor
whitacre jumps on it like a grenade
whitacres kids come out of the house and stand clustered at a distance confused and terrified
helpless in the face of a fallen parent
ginger turns to her mother
that goddam dwayne andreas did this to him mom
he ought to be killed
sometimes id leave the country with a big suitcase full of cash
walk right through customs
whitacre lies on the couch talking to doctor miller s genial soft spoken
this is not internal its therapy
walk back in with a bag full of jewelry
you never thought youd get caught
that never occurred to me
i mean i look respectable
why would they search me
and now theyre saying i stole million dollars
thats what ive been accused of
they were paying me grand but it wasnt enough i was spending more like eight
so i took kickbacks
like i said its just what you did if you wanted to be part of the gang at adm
is that how it was when you were a kid you wanted to be part of the gang
one time i got a brand new top of the line bicycle
and i bragged to everyone about it
i told everybody how much it cost
it cost ninety dollars
how did you come to work for the they approached me
this doesnt make much sense to miller
how is it that they came to you
did they know about the price fixing
this agent brian shepard came to a number of junior executives at adm
thats why they approached me
the price fixing hadnt even started yet
miller is confused by this
but uh if no crime was then mark id like to have you checked into the hospital
whitacre looks over at a file cabinet
is thatwhereyou keep your files
im the main witness againstthesepeople
you dont know whoyoure dealing with theylldo anything to win
whitacre in his hospital gown vanishes slowly head first into the mri tube
over the last few years hes really changed
ginger and miller have a cup of coffee
he just kept buying things
we have eight cars three of them we never even use
i was always the one with the temper and corky was the happy one but thats changed too
since he said hed cooperate with the fbi hes become so intolerant of everyone
why do you call him corky
hes had that name since high school
he was like a champagne cork always flying off somewhere
whitacre looks beaten
his voice is cracking hes distracted
not very corky right now
theres one in hong kong
and then theres the bank accounts in switzerland and grand cayman
other things theres a lawyer in new york who has a million dollars of mine
and have you told your attorney the truth about all of these accounts
no but i dont need to
the other assets are legal definitely
you need to tell your attorney
i dont know if i can trust him
mark has anybody in your family ever been diagnosed as bipolar or manic depressive
whitacre nods and leans in
i had an aunt who they said that about my real parents died when i was pretty young and i was adopted
a woman weve never seen before is giving a deposition to a have you ever heard that mark told people he was adopted
it was in the paper that he was adopted
mark is your natural born son isnt that correct
evelyn whitacre isnt dead after all shes being deposed
according to the adoption story mark told his parents were killed in a car accident
is there any truth in that
mark knows hes not adopted
he grew up in our house
another aspect of the story is that his parents are wealthy
do you consider yourself wealthy
and when did mark first send you a check from the account in switzerland
whitacre appears again with epstein before another herd of my client is here to cooperate fully so agent dangelo if you have any questions
agent tony dangelo relaxed more like herndon than shepard
this is your chance to put everything on the table
this is the chance to redeem yourself but if youre not going to be completely honest you should stop talking now
i understand that
and i want to tell you i feel bad
im so sorry and i feel worst about letting down brian shepard and bob herndon
last time we talked i was under a great deal of stress and i said some things that werent true
id like to clear that up
whitacre is more earnest than ever before he begins
the first kickback was in mick knew all about it he told me thered be plenty of opportunities to take kick backs on asian and european contracts at adm
was anyone else involved
uh sid hulse
sid hulse testifies with his lawyer sheldon zenner and fbi agent grant and a bunch of doj lawyers
before sid says anything you know about these schemes with the nigerian letters
we see it every day
you ever wonder who was dumb enough to fall for something like that
hulse is flushed
this is really embarrassing
but thats how mark and i first got involved financially
then there was rheinhard richter who i worked with in mexico
we had some deal that involved
richter the guy from the admirals club in mexico city is questioned by fbi agent basset
richters entire financial history is spread out on the table in front of them
so we have money leaving your account here and here and here and its going to whitacres account
his wife gingers account
this one is going to whitacres parents account
like i said those are loans
agent basset isnt buying it
look we know youre sticking up for mark here but your story doesnt seem true
mark is cooperating now
its not true
all the money went to mark
when did it start
mark told me about this nigerian thing he got in the mail
and then there was marty allison
martys a good friend
marty allison and his lawyer michael monico appear before a host of fbi agents and lawyers
mark told you guys about nigeria right
nobody says anything
when i started at adm uh in mark got a letter from nigeria
the office as weve seen it bustling with business
allison walks down the hall and is stopped by whitacre
hey marty got a minute
he takes a seat across the desk from whitacre
whitacre shows him the nigerian letter
he told me hed been in touch with certain parties in nigeria
businessmen who had overbilled the government there for millions but now needed bogus invoices from legitimate us business men to make it all look above board
you put in ten grand you get a hundred back
i know people who have made millions on this
my step father cleaned up
basset and allison
hed never heard of the nigerian scam
not until a couple years later when sixty minutes ran a piece on it showing how people had lost a fortune on the con
and the kickbacks
he had me set up a company in germany and send fake invoices
id get a check for like grand and most of it would go back to mark
you kept the rest
he told me management knew about it
but it seemed to me that he was doing the same thing to adm that the nigerians had done to us
whitacre has laid out an amazing litany of theft and deception
how much money did you receive through all your illegal activities
whitacre takes a moment does the math in his head mouthing to himself the various sources of his massive fraud
but mick knew
like i said he endorsed these things
he endorsed you stealing
he might have though that was a bit much
is there anything else you want to tell us
well i think you did a real good job today i do know that adm has been stealing microbes from the japanese for years and that they use prostitutes to
get information from the competitions facility in iowa
i know that mick andreas uses cocaine and i have that on tape and there are illegal campaign contributions to both american and foreign politicians
an empty band shell by lake michigan
whitacre sits by himself wearing dark glasses holding an envelope
when agents go under cover for the fbi they get trained for the stresses of living a secret life
epstein addresses the standard assortment of lawyers mann mutchnik spearing spratling etc
we hear this all the time from you guys how easy it is for trained agents to crack
and here is mark
a civilian with no training
whitacre gets up and walks toward a black sedan
he looks around paranoid
he wouldnt make a good spy
but you guys shove him in there you tell him go for it without anything to make sure he doesnt crack under pressure
you have to ask yourself was the us government taken in by mark whitacre or did it help create him
whitacre leans into the car and hands off the envelope
he speaks to some hoodlum we cant see
where we talked about
epsteins plea is moving hes reaching these people
mark committed a crime
he stole nine million dollars
but these guys from adm stole hundreds of millions of dollars from innocent people all over the world
mark showed you that four white guys in suits getting together in the middle of the day isnt a business meeting
its a crime scene
and not only did he tell you about it he got you the evidence to prove it
now were not looking for the moon and stars
were looking for something in the area of three years
or we can take it to trial
and in that trial ill lay out everything mark whitacre did good and bad
whitacre stands in the parking lot reading the paper on a cool autumn day
no black sedan
the big clock outside the bank in the mall says
whitacre walks over to a trash can and removes a bottle of medication from his pocket
he empties it into the trash
and somewhere a future whistle blower is going to pick up the new york times and the wall street journal and read what marks life has become because he decided
whitacre gives up gets in his car and drives away
he drives his point home
a brilliant performance
because he decided to take on a powerful company and then youll never have one of these white collar guys pick up a phone and call you ever again
whitacre comes flying through the door his jacket is now ripped his glasses are bent hes holding his arm
he looks like hes been through hell
they grabbed me
there were two of them
ginger rushes through the house to the aid of her husband
oh my god
they wouldnt let me out of the car
look at your shirt
as she embraces him we are close on whitacre
whitacre and ginger are interviewed by the local news anchor against the wand backdrop
whitacre is calm convincing
i was abducted
they took me for a twenty minute joy ride and told me that i basically better forget everything thats not on tape
did the men identify themselves
i think we know who sent them
and they sawed the locks off the door like like mafia thugs
and where is the fbi in all this
shepard watches the interview on the tv in the corner in the crowded diner
what people have to realize is the fbi did the same thing
they locked my husband in an investigation and drove our family around for three years threatening him
you tell me where are they now
he is stung by her words
i had a lot of faith in the guys at the fbi they always said theyd take care of me
shepard throws some money down on the lunch counter and leaves
epstein brings a deal to mark and ginger
he believes he has saved his client but the whitacres feel differently
three to five years
but adms the bad guys
youve got to focus here
you stole nine million dollars
and then you lied about it
maybe in your head youre one of the good guys but to them your a guy who stole a lot of money and lied about it
ginger and i have been talking and wed like to file a law suit against brian shepard and the ijs government
jesus christ for what mark
he hit me with a brief case
this is news to ginger but she believes it
and he told me to destroy certain tapes that didnt help the case
epstein throws up his hands
mark im telling you take the plea
whitacre smiles and looks at ginger
but were going to go a different way
mark sits in his office staring at a letter from doctor miller
i read this study in time magazine when i was at cornell which is an ivy league school and there were a lot of people who never believed including my
mother that i would make it to an ivy league school maybe just ginger who i met in marching band in the th grade
fragments of the contents this is to inform you of your lithium levels
exacerbated by stress
a strict drug regimen
and the study said that people had nice sympathetic feelings about people who were adopted and treated them better
so i made up this adoption story and people did treat me better and when i got a job one of my professors told the people at ralston purina that
i was this amazing guy that had accomplished all of this in spite of being adopted whitacre takes out a pair of scissors and goes to work on the letter
and so it was really other people who spread the story not me although i admit it was wrong to start it and everything it was other people who kept
even the people at adm
my new lawyer sees that
bill walker fat and ruled by fantasy is whitacres new lawyer
he sits in a golf shirt and tennis shoes facing a squad of amazed doj prosecutors
this all goes back many years before most of us were born
its bigger than any of us and its ongoing
i know youre skeptical but ive seen it
my client mark whitacre has shown it to me
maybe im just a personal injury lawyer from taylorville nowhere illinois but i tell you i know the identity of the master puppeteer
the doj lawyers try not to laugh
master puppeteer and its not who youre thinking
mark sits splicing tapes of brian shepard from one tape recorder to another trying to piece together an incriminating tape to frame shepard
grandiosity and embellishment what they call it when you embellish things those are the major symptoms of bipolar disorder
and the other the second major symptom is poor judgement
and thats something brian shepard should have known the bipolar disorder is what made me believe id be president when it was over
although there was a time when mick told me on a trip to nebraska that i could be headed for the top
mark has tapes tapes the government doesnt want us to hear
walker is in full rant
he holds a letter up for all to see
tapes that outline the actions of brian shepard who hit mark whitacre with a brief case when mark was cooperating with the government
and he has a letter from his psychiatrist outlining and confirming the cruelty perpetrated on him by agent shepard
a letter from his psychiatrist clearly exonerating him from all wrongdoing
walker hands the letter over to spearing
gray snow on fields of dirt and broken corn stalks
an empty swimming pool and a for sale sign in the yard
inside shepard sits with whitacre and ginger
shepard holds i read the letter from doctor miller mark
its not true
definitely its on his letterhead he signed it
the area code
he puts the letter in the middle of the table
it says the letter was written in november that area code didnt exist then
well everybody knew the area code change was coming
lots of people ordered new stationery early
i thought about that
so i asked the phone company
this is the press release announcing the area code
he puts the release on the table
its dated six days after your letter was written doctor miller couldnt have known about it
whitacre stares at it then looks up
ron henkoff from fortune ron henkoff from fortune called doctor miller and called doctor miller and miller confirmed the miller confirmed the letter
i called miller mark
ginger quietly starts to cry picks up the letter
he cant talk to you
thats he cant talk to you
thats a violation of doctor patient a violation of doctor patient confidentiality
doctor patient confidentiality doesnt apply to forgeries
ginger cries harder
whitacre tries again
then why did fortune magazine then why did fortune magazine run the story
run the story
ginger has had it she breaks down
he never wrote the letter
stop it mark
you have to stop doing this to yourself please stop
whitacre is done
i think maybe i should go back to the hospital
whitacre looks like shit
he sits with walker in judge harold bakers courtroom
case united states of america versus mark whitacre
you have the right to make a statement if you wish
whitacre nods and stands
i appreciate the opportunity to say a few words its been a long five years
i apologize to a lot of people in this room
they sit together in the back row
and to a lot of them who are not in this room for my actions
i realize i hurt a lot of people and i apologize greatly
i am here to accept my punishment
to observe that mr
whitacre is the usual felon is a gross understatement
he is well educated has a loving wife and family is respected in the community
it is not inconceivable that in due course he may have become ceo of archer daniels midland
he knew he could be ceo someday
we hear whitacre in a calmer time
i like jail
i think its been good for me
but the judge isnt done with him
however the court can find no clear connection between mr
whitacres bipolar disorder and the counts of criminal misconduct he has been charged with just garden variety greed
it is very difficult to tell when mr
whitacre is telling the truth
a larger courtroom
mick and terry stand for sentencing surrounded by aubrey daniel and others
but i dont think what happened is fair when you look at what happened to me compared to mick and terry
i mean if you go and hold up your local grocery store you might get five years
mick and terry held up every grocery store in the world and they only got three
so you tell me how it makes sense that i get nine
i think thats something you should consider mr
president when reviewing my request for pardon
whitacre is in his green prison jumpsuit bald his toupee another deception also gone
he sits in front of a video camera in the beam of one light
a cameraman records his draft id also like to take this opportunity to apologize to special agent brian shepard on behalf of myself and my wife ginger he never hit
me with a brief case or told me to destroy tapes
the idea to sue him wasnt mine it came from someone at adm and i shouldnt have listened
i cant remember who
when i was at adm i lived so many lives i wasnt sure who i was
today i know more who i am and what i really want out of life
ive completed three post graduate degrees while in detention
which is of course a law degree and another advanced degree in the psychology of jury selection
i sleep better in prison than i have in years
my wife has forgiven me and believes that the ordeal with adm has brought us closer together in a marriage of over years
i hope you will allow me to leave here so that i can re join my life with my family and three kids
two of whom are adopted
especially when you consider that thanks in large part to my testimony the us government has been able to collect over a billion dollars in price fixing fines from big
the light goes out
the cameraman starts packing up the equipment
out of the shadows steps bob herndon
good luck with the appeal mark
thanks for helping me remember everything bob
i sure appreciate it
i wish brian couldve come
he still pretty angry
you tell him im real sorry
can you do that for me
the funny part is if id never gone undercover i would have never stolen million
it was my way out
what else could i do i wrote my own severance
before herndon can respond a correctional officer approaches
i gotta go bob
herndon does some math
i thought it came out to nine
did i say eleven
boy it was only nine
the eleven is with interest
mark are you still taking your medication
the doctor here says i dont need it anymore
i can manage without it now that theres less stress
it was just the stress of the fbi
herndon turns to leave and then he pauses
mark was it eleven
i mean there isnt something else we need to
i dont know bob you tell me
he smiles and turns his back on the agent and walks down the hall toward work detail
sfx a drum roll explodes into the roar of the clashs cover of i fought the law and the law won
as joe strummer sings breaking rocks in the hot sun
parked in the driveway is a truck with an adm logo on it two adm workers have set up some seismic equipment on the lawn
one works the gear the other talks to the new owner
whitacre never told me anything about any hidden rooms and tunnels and neither did the realtor
ginger whitacre checks out of the grocery store
as each item is scanned by the cashier we freeze on the side of the package
instead of the ingredients panel of the package we another item
how would you like to pay for this
ginger opens her checkbook
the adm workers have dug a hole in the yard
the new owner looks on shaking her head
whitacre drives a combine in a corn field behind a barbed wire fence he wears an orange jumpsuit and a white hat
green gold stalks of corn flash by
the combine harvests the husk we have been holding on clearing the frame
leaving only blue skies
