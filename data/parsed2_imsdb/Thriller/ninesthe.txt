written by john august november one thing that will be obvious to viewers but not to readers is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only
three actors gary gavin gabriel sarah susan sierra margaret melissa mary itll make more sense in context
unwinds a short length of green string
were extremely close with a shallow blurry focus
its like the first moments after a dream just fragments
scissors cut the string
the man wraps it around his left wrist
we see the mans teeth the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight
his fingers pull against the string
it wont break easily
theres no music
no sound at all really except for some distant birds chirping
then a squeak
a squeal as rusty springs engage
revealing gary banks in silhouette
hes effortlessly fit with movie star good looks
although for now hes merely a tv star
like most laurel canyon garages this one has never held a car
instead its the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom shitty ikea furniture a drum set a styrofoam snowman and the harley he always meant to get running
gary spots what he was looking for
gary drags a beaten weber kettle
one of its wheels is broken scraping against the deck
wider we see garys house has an incredible view of the city
he couldnt fucking care less
he yanks the circular grill out of the weber and throws it down the canyon
he empties a garbage bag into the barbecue mostly womens clothes but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames
theres too much to fit so he tries stomping it down with a flip flopped foot
he cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside
he sprays until the container is wheezing air
he shakes it making sure its really empty
then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying
we follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of gary and a blonde woman
her eyes are scratched out making her unrecognizable
under the grill lighter fluid is dripping in a stream soaking into the wooden deck
finally satisfied gary throws the lighter fluid aside
he takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket
extremely close as the match scrapes erupting in flames
on garys left wrist we see a green string bracelet
music starts a pounding hypnotic track that will carry us through these main titles
in epic slow motion we follow the burning match as it sails through the air tumbling end over end
just as its about to reach its target we
shoots to miles per gallon
its the display of garys prius
garys at the wheel driving as he finishes a fifth of bourbon
jump cuts take us out of hollywood heading downtown
our travelling music is serving us well
gary stops at a light
he looks left and sees himself on the side of a bus
its an ad for crime lab this fall mondays are killer
gary watches himself drive away
further along gary spots two thuggy teenagers sitting on a low wall
he calls out to them hey
do you sell crack
the boys look wary
im only a cop on tv
money changes hands
gary holds a small ziplock bag and has no idea what to do with its lumpy beige contents
gary pulls up to a curb
hes now on sunset blvd
a matronly black streetwalker octavia approaches the passenger window
gary holds up the little bag
is this crack
she takes a closer look
do you know how to do it
gary and octavia jump up and down on the bed each trying to bounce higher than the other laughing all the while
gary bounces so high that he thunks his head against the ceiling
he crumples falling off the bed
but hes still laughing
later octavia is sleeping
gary takes a shower with his jeans on
toweling off gary looks at his body in the mirror
he notices something odd
he tries to wake octavia up but shes down for the count
looking around he finds his cell phone
pacing he tries to sober up while it rings
the far side answers
im having a medical situation
i dont have a belly button
explaining carefully i do not have a belly button where i should on my belly
and im concerned because i dont know if thats
he sits down on the edge of the bed
can a person live without a belly button
because if you think about it youre born with one
so if you dont have one youre unborn and its really hazy whether youre alive or not
i guess im wondering am i alive
a sudden thought or what if im god
im totally sober
no i dont think i need an ambulance
i dont seem to be dying any faster than usual
but i should probably go to the hospital dont you think
yeah i should
he hangs up
hes driving again but most of his attention is focused on trying to locate his missing navel
he looks up in the rear view mirror where he sees two sitting in the back seat
all three garys give each other thumbs up
driver gary looks out the driver side window where he sees shoes and asphalt
only now do we rotate to reveal were gary has rolled the car
the music suddenly stops
we hear sirens approaching
part one margaret oreilly is speaking to herself
la la la la la
like youve never done worse
from a new angle we see shes using a cell phone earpiece
he totalled a car
but it was an environmentally friendly car
why doesnt that get reported
he was heartbroken betrayed
you say you understand but you dont
youre like a big giant vulcan
noticing something to her right
ill call you later
she hangs up wrapping the earpiece around her phone
we reveal being escorted through glass doors by a polo shirted parole officer
margaret moves to intercept them offering a hand
i work for lola
to the parole officer we need to go out the back
margaret leads the way
shes been here before
are there reporters out front
not hugh grant level
more like robert downey jr
when he broke into that familys house and slept in the kids bed like goldilocks
this bed is just right
i handled episodes two through four for robert
this sort of thing is my specialty
famous fuck ups
mamas gonna take good care of you
a phone rings
a designer kitchen in hancock park spacious and kosher ready
the phone on the counter is ringing
gary picks it up
he looks to margaret while the other end of the call talks at length
then very deliberately
the weather in toledo is rainy
he says this like a sleeper agent repeating his trigger phrase
use your normal voice
to the phone nine dogs ran through the field
the koala sits in the tree
the parole officer takes the phone from him punching in a series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet
its computer voice recognition
the system can call you any time day or night
if you dont answer within five rings the police come and haul your ass off
what if im not here
catching the officers concerned look
thats why its called house arrest
you stay inside your house
to the officer he can take direction i promise
margaret pulls open curtains flooding the room with light
gary wanders checking it all out
okay just so its said this house is flammable
i didnt mean to burn down my house
yeah i didnt mean to eat my way into a ten year shame spiral but i did and its healthier to acknowledge it
moving on this flammable house belongs to one of lolas other fabulous clients who is currently shooting a pilot in toronto
so for the next six weeks su casa es su casa
i say feel free to wear his clothes
hell probably get a sick thrill of out it
noticing two crates
he has dogs
theyre away at summer camp
now try the bed
he lies back on it feeling it out
she massages his besocked feet
look gary i know this has been crazy and stressful
i want you to feel safe
im a fan of yours you know
your number one fan
gary looks over his toes at margaret
from this angle she looks a bit like kathy bates from misery
but if you fuck this up i will smash your ankles with a sledge hammer
a long beat
that wouldnt be comfortable for either of us
margaret boxes up the alcohol while gary bounces a lime on the island
ill be coming by twice a day to check up on you
im the only person who should be coming by
no buddies no pals no heroin dealers
i dont do heroin
yeah crack is classy
and im not buying you porn
theres spray per view on cable
i really wasnt concerned about my career my family or my future
i just wanted to jack off
margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone
let me see your phone
he hands over his cell phone
she drops it in the contraband box
all my numbers are in that
dial ten digits at random
whoever answers will be better than the people on this phone
she picks up the liquor box ready to go
you have my cell number
you have delivery menus
as she leaves margaret notices a long butane lighter by the stove
she adds it to the box just to be sure
gary paces around his new home trying to get a feel for it
he plays a few notes on the piano
he looks up at the painting over the staircase a cliff near the ocean
he opens random drawers in a chinese herb cabinet wondering if theres anything hidden in one of the slots
he takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room which show the same thing in three different ways
gary swims laps trying to exhaust himself
he stands in the shallow end listening to the quiet
wearing a fluffy white robe he looks through the delivery menus
he takes a bag of food from a college age delivery guy who seems to recognize him
gary pays him shuts the door
as hes walking to the kitchen with the food gary looks back and sees the delivery guy watching him from the front walk
the guy is a little embarrassed but gary is pretty used to being stared at
gary unwraps the thai food
makes himself a plate
he watches crime lab on the plasma screen while eating dinner
once we get these samples back to the crime lab well know who the real killer is
gary scans the shelves looking for something to read
there are five times more books here than gary has opened in his lifetime
he settles on a paperback of voltaires candide
he lies back on the couch reading it
he flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting
to soft core pay per view
were close on garys straining face but we can hear the pleasured moans of the actresses as they go down on each other
nearing climax he looks for something to come on
he cant find anything
his left hand cupped to hold the semen he pads barefoot from the tv room to the downstairs bathroom
we hear water running as he washes his hands
then it shuts off
we hear a thunk
something hard was dropped on the wood floor
gary hears it too
he steps out of the bathroom looks around
he takes a few silent paces back in our direction stopping just before he reaches the two story section of the foyer
thats when he hears it click click click click on the wooden floor
a jingle of metal
we follow garys eyes up to the second floor walkway
we can hear the little footsteps toe nails clicking
but theres no dog
back on gary increasingly unsettled
hes directly below the walkway and cant see up into it
is somebody there
he claps his hands twice
hes about to venture a step forward when suddenly he nearly jumps out of his skin
it rings two more times before he ducks into the tv room to answer it
he turns his back to the foyer listening to the instructions on the phone
nine leopards run through the jungle
listening i bought two cakes at the store
his identity evidently confirmed he hangs up
he looks back into the foyer
the house is haunted
theres a zeitgeist or something
margarets brought coffee and pastries from susina
poltergeist and no
maybe they were rats
is teaming with rats
they live in the palm trees
hes obviously not convinced
you know im a licensed psychotherapist
im a publicist
my job is what other people think of you not what you think of yourself
so pull your shit together
i am thisclose to getting christine walsh to do your piece in parade
i fucking hate parade
everyone hates parade
but the people who watch crime lab they love their marilyn vos savant
give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee haw heaven
one heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner wont kill off your character between seasons
he gets it
i swear to god if you go batshit on me
im not crazy
gary is lying in the sun eyes shut
suddenly a golf ball hits him on the head
he sits up perplexed
for a long moment he has no idea where the ball came from until he hears a voice from beyond the wall that separates the properties
a practiced ear notices a canadian accent
to your left
he follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard finding sarah gleason
late s fresh scrubbed and girlish she looks more fragile than she really is
im working on my putting if you can believe it
indeed shes holding a putter
maybe i was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor
you see im under house arrest too
what did you do
i had sex with my husband
nine months later i had jaden
thats her over there
she points to a small portable baby monitor
shes sleeping for another
checks watch seventeen minutes
she keeps to a schedule
she sounds really boring
whispers she is
a smile between them
shouldnt you have a nanny from ecuador
as if that explains it ohhh
i cant work in the u
plus i want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself
another pregnant pause
listen jaden goes down again at
maybe i could stop by
im pretty sure ill be here
its a date
she picks up the baby monitor heading back into her house
suddenly she realizes
im sarah by the way
gary brushes his teeth and tongue
gary neatens up tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes
he plumps pillows
he looks up at the clock
he sits trying to read candide again
he looks at the clock again
under the pretense of sweeping up leaves he peers over the wall looking directly into sarahs kitchen
but theres no one in there
gary carefully sets rat traps staggering them every few feet
he pokes one with a pencil
the metal arm snaps back breaking the pencil in two
gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached to it
he turns it on
he opens the piano bench finding computer disks
a red disk is labelled knowing
he puts it in
the piano begins playing by itself a sensuous but melancholy gary lies on the floor listening to it
he stares up at the elaborate chandelier
gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk trying to read more of his book
he looks over to see sarah coming up the steps carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay
she stops beside him
the best of all possible worlds
pointing to his book voltaire
off his reaction are you actually reading it
i thought i was
he gets up
sorry i bailed
jaden had a fever
how boring of her
she hands him the wine
the best part is i can drink it
i pumped before i came
so did i
sarah tops off garys wine glass
theyre both on the couch
the baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them
so its kind of hard to prove that i only meant to burn my ex girlfriends stuff and not the entire house
fires tricky that way
how about you
any history of arson
i knew it
i could see that little spark
it wasnt arson
a long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him the story
when i was a little girl our house caught on fire
music begins providing backing to her monologue
ill never forget the look on my fathers face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the burning building out onto the pavement
on gary feeling bad he brought this up but fascinated at the same time
i stood there shivering in my pajamas and watched the whole world go up in flames
and when it was all over i said to myself is that all there is to a fire
is that all there is
as she starts to sing gary realizes the story isnt hers at all
its peggy lees is that all there is
is that all there is is that all there is
if thats all there is my friends then lets keep dancing
she leans closer
lets break out the booze and have a ball
if thats all there is
standing up sarah takes garys hands pulling him off the couch
she leads him to an open area more space for dancing
is that all there is is that all there is
if thats all there is my friends then lets keep dancing
lets break out the booze and have a ball if thats all there is
sarah leans up to the mirror trying to get her contacts in
its not going well
her eyes are tearing up
then i fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world
we would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each others eyes
we were so very much in love
then one day he went away and i thought id die
but i didnt
and when i didnt i said to myself is that all there is to love
sarah and gary start to dance
is that all there is
is that all there is
if thats all there is my friends then lets keep
deep in the bowels of the store sarah is surrounded by vintage lighting fixtures
shes futilely trying to match a specific light switch plate
i know what youre thinking
if thats the way she feels about it why doesnt she just end it all
im in no hurry for that final disappointment
i know just as well as im standing here talking to you when that final moment comes and im breathing my last breath ill be saying to myself
sarah and gary become more intimately acquainted on the couch
they still havent kissed but hands are running up and down over clothing
sarah isnt singing anymore though her voice continues
is that all there is is that all there is
if thats all there is my friends then lets keep dancing
lets break out the booze and have a ball if thats all there
just as theyre about to kiss its the monitor hissing and popping as jaden wakes up from her nap cranky and hungry
sarah pushes back
gary tries to close the gap but shes already standing up
i need to
as she reaches for one she knocks over a wine glass
dont worry about it
carrying both her shoes shes across the room and out the front door before he can say anything more
gary washes the wine glasses being sure to wash off any trace of lipstick
he dries them and puts them back in the cabinet
faced with the remainder of the wine he considers dumping it down the sink
instead he chugs it from the bottle
he wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the recycling
gary works out hard on the elliptical trainer
he has his ipod cranked with a pounding tune
he does abs on a stability ball
gary enters from the driveway door gulping from a water bottle
he starts to look through the delivery menus when he notices an orange post it note by the telephone
it reads look for the nines
he picks it up looks at the back
sticks it back down on the counter
gary sits on the couch with his water bottle listening to the baby monitor sarah is singing a lullaby
he takes off his shoes and socks
when shes finished
for a long beat its quiet
then we hear rustling
a crib toy plays a short melody
then a slightly digital voice speaks the cat says meow
the pig says oink
gary smiles to himself
the cow says moo
the cow says moo
the cow says moo
evidently jaden loves the cow
the dog says nine
gary looks back
did he just hear that
the phone rings
gary answers it on the third ring
its the parole system
two trains run through the forest
we see a sudden change in garys expression
he nearly drops the phone
forcing himself not to panic he pushes the button for speakerphone
he wants to make sure hes hearing it right
gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and jump on him
suddenly he backs into he spins around startled
he only catches a glimpse of the man same height same build same everything
the man is gone in half an instant vanished into thin air
gary bolts for the door
reaching the foyer gary steps on a which snaps down on his toes
he screams pulling it off
he looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main floor rather than the second floor walkway
limping he hops out the door
we stay behind looking out through the open door
headlights flare as cars travel down miracle mile bringing us to a metro bus stop a semi enclosed bench with backlit signage
the far side of the shelter has a one sheet for crime lab
this fall mondays are murder
the bench side is a promo poster for a show called knowing
some fates are chosen for you
its here we find gary taking a seat gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped
hes hobbled his way here from the house which is probably a block away
theres only a little blood but his toes really hurt
over garys shoulder we see a blonde year old girl noelle watching him with concern
she bangs on the shelter to get his attention
gary nearly jumps out of his skin
you scared the shit out of
she signs whats wrong
signed subtitled youre hurt
i dont speak that
she points to his toes
getting what she must mean
ill be fine
looking around he realizes that the little girl is out here by herself
where are your parents
she looks at him oddly not really getting the question
your mom your dad
where are they
signed subtitled mom is at the car
where you left her
again gary has no idea what shes saying
signed subtitled youre lost
look you need to go back okay
you shouldnt be out here
its not safe
noelle glances to her left
we hear bwoop bwoop as a police cruiser pulls over to the curb
we go to a wider angle as two officers get out of the car
gary looks back
noelle is gone though theres really nowhere she could have disappeared
putting on his best face for the police
handcuffed gary is placed in back
hes reserving the right to remain silent
once again the idea of house arrest is you stay inside your house
the same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet to garys left leg
we see that garys left foot also features bandaged toes
think of it like an electronic leash
basically if you ever go more than feet from the base station
she points to an electronic device by the wall
the cops come they throw your ass in jail
if you ever try to take it off the cops come and throw your ass in jail
and if they ever detect drugs or alcohol in your system
the cops come and throw my ass in jail
i kick your ass
then the cops come and throw your ass in jail
the parole officer smiles
do i still have to answer the phone
no ill be doing that from now on
im moving into the guest room
i dont need a babysitter
despite all evidence to the contrary
dont worry im a cool roomie
who do you think taught affleck how to gamble
the parole officer hits a test button on the anklet which lets out a piercing alarm
lets never hear that again
margaret walks heel to toe counting her steps
with a piece of chalk she draws a line on the concrete
she looks back to gary whos waiting by the front door
the edge of your world
in the world
jumps over the line out of the world
in the world
out of the world
look at me im dancin
she starts doing the running man over the line
even garys dark mood is broken
margaret and gary roast marshmallows over the propane grill to make smores
so the guy was like do you know fencing
and i say of course
thats what it says on my headshot
so he says foil or epi
i say im about equal in both
which is true
so he tosses me this fucking conan sword and goes after me
im just swinging trying to stay alive
but i end up cutting his ear
you cut his ear off
just a little
but i got the job
margaret is confused
you were in pirates of the caribbean
not the movie the ride
i was like gar
keep both hands inside the boat
margaret laughs so hard she coughs
ready for bed margaret leans out the guest bedroom door
gary looks out his door
goodnight you filthy whore
both doors shut
margaret and gary sip their morning beverages looking at something spectacular in the yard
whenever i see them and i always feel like damn
i was born at the wrong time
we reverse to see the object of their awe a giant inflatable jump o rama in the shape of a castle
various shots gary and margaret jump with all their might bouncing off the walls screaming all the time
when both finally collapse it becomes strangely tranquil
theyre safe inside an inflatable paradise
gary scoots over beside margaret
she puts her head on his arms
prelap a doorbell rings
gary opens the door to find sarah
wheres the warden
quite the little missus
she walks past him into the house
sarah crosses to the couch picking up the baby monitor
we havent had nearly the grand old time you two have been having
theres an edge to her voice
youve been watching
i dont want to meddle in your affairs
everyone needs affection
i get it
shes headed back for the door
are you seriously jealous
i just want to protect her
look at you
you date models
on a scale of one to ten you belong with the nines
we both know you wont settle for less
with that shes gone
gary is trying to load dishes into the dishwasher but has a hard time getting one bowl to fit
what are the nines
he looks over
margaret holds up the orange sticky note by the phone
look for the nines
its not mine
its your handwriting
i didnt write it
she puts it back down
but she doesnt believe him
all ee all ee all come free
i thought you were
at the far edge of the property margaret and gary play backgammon
their mood is significantly more subdued
margaret answers her ringing cell phone
to gary i have to take this
margaret starts walking back to the house
on phone well who thought it was a good idea letting courtney into a pottery shop
left alone gary rolls the dice idly
he gets a and a
he keeps rolling the wheels in his head starting to turn
sarah is looking in through the living room windows trying to spot gary
giving up she turns back to the main steps only to find
who doesnt look pleased
i know who you are
i know what you are
and if you come near him again
margaret lets that go unanswered
theres obviously something big were not privy to
what are you going to do m
shes forgotten margarets name if she ever knew it
sorry whats he calling you
i like that
why cant you just leave him alone
hes an actor
if nobodys watching him he doesnt really exist
approaching and for the record im not the one deceiving him
hes going to figure it out eventually
and when he does who do you think hes gonna blame
sarah lets her warning land then walks past margaret heading back down the stairs
reveal gary watching through the hole in the door
gary heard the whole conversation
or at least enough of it to be deeply freaked out
margaret leans out her doorway goodnight ratface
gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs staring at his still made bed
its impossible to know what hes thinking but the wheels are turning
gary opens the newspaper to a page at random
he starts circling things with a red sharpie
macro close up
his pen circles the number nine every time it appears
as he flips the page he spots sarah looking in through the rounded trellis just a few feet away
shes holding her own newspaper still in the wrapper
sorry for the psychotic episode
ill blame it on hormones
are you alright
you look a little beautiful mind ish
he almost deflects it but decides to trust her how many times should the number nine come up
annoyed you know what i mean
one time out of ten
how about every time
he hands her the paper through the bars
but they only show up when you look for them
looking for them changes things
trying to find an explanation
some of these are prices
theres going to be a lot of nines when
there is something wrong with the world
sarah looks up slowly
she smiles for an uncomfortably long beat
shes stalling thinking
you have an eyelash on your
she steps forward and motions for him to lean closer to the bars
brushing off the non existent eyelash she whispers
i can get you out of here
but you have to trust me
enters carrying her tea
she sees gary by himself leaning near the bars of the trellis
i like peaches
we see that sarah is flush back against the wall out of margarets line of sight
you want coffee
she turns and heads back into the house
once shes out of earshot
what do i do
you have to trust me
close on a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the room about ten feet up
it might be a smoke detector
gary stares up at it intently
he steps forward
a little red light flicks on inside the unit
after a few seconds it turns off
its some sort of motion detector
gary tests it again trying to move his arm slowly enough that the light never engages
margaret enters carrying two mugs
she watches him warily
tell me about the nines
sort of hard to start there
and dont tell me im imagining it
theyre showing up everywhere and i want to know why
trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation best guess
theyre your subconscious trying to remind you who you are
im a nine
it doesnt make a lot of sense of out context
he takes the mug then reconsiders
maybe its laced with something
why dont you drink coffee
youre always drinking tea
frustrated she takes his coffee back and drinks it
shed really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point but its just too hot
she gestures for him to sit down
reluctantly he does
she sits across from him
youre not going to understand this yet but weve known each other for like years
one day when i was you called me out of the blue
and weve been talking ever since
on the phone
i never met you before i came here
you gary never met me
but youre not always
lacking the words i can understand why youre a little confused
im a lot confused
this is all a dream
im in a coma
then im dead
this is hell or purgatorium or something
okay a purgatorium is where romans vomited
this is as real as anything can be
suspicious what does that mean
she sits forward in her chair
by instinct he sits back
everything is what it is
but youre not who you think you are
gary gets up headed for the front door
please gary dont
but hes already outside
hes walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line headed for sarahs house
leaves fall lazily from the trees counter point to the tension
margaret calls out from the arched windows
you dont know what youre doing
shes almost at tears
he stops at the edge of the chalk line
what happens if i cross this line
the tear in her eye falls
i dont know
but its not good
he very deliberately steps over the line
we hear a thin beeping from the house arrest anklet
he shoots her a look to say is that all there is
but the beeping grows louder deeper
it starts to come from all sides booming a nuclear meltdown self destruct sequence activated drone
gary suddenly realizes something very very terrible is about to happen
the world ignites in white hot atomic flames
we see the blinding glare erupt behind margaret illuminating through her skin right to the bone
the same flash catches a leaf in mid air sizzling through it like an etched x ray
as the light hits gary we
reader note part is a half hour episode of a project greenlight style documentary series called behind the screen which tracks the progress of a one hour tv drama pilot
from conception through delivery
in keeping with the genre its very fast and cutty
interview sequences are done to an off camera interviewer
some scenes are unscripted
the gist of these scenes is summarized in italics
part two we rush in on a television set which spins around revealing a blinding constellation of pixels
previously on behind the screen
gavin taylor walks to a meeting with his laptop bag over his shoulder
he has a tidy banana republic sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule
gavin taylors one of the best tv writers out there
cluttered and corporate with stacks of scripts and a few touches of arbitrary quirk
susan howard and gavin kiss hello
every network would kill to work with him
knowing is a one hour drama about a woman whose husband disappears
she starts to believe that her daughter is the key to a dark conspiracy
gavin pitches his show to the network bosses
basically its like rosemarys toddler
gavin is beaming
we sold it in the room
gavin leans into the speakerphone
just tell me roger liked the script
susan is on her speakerphone
youre shooting a pilot
gavin has coffee with actress melissa mccarthy his best friend
hes pitching her the idea
melissa mccarthy is my first and only choice for the lead
i love it
ill do it
an epk style interview on the set of the pilot
gavin and i have been friends for forever
melissa hangs out with her gilmore girls cast and crew
its really hard to leave a show like gilmore girls but i really believe in gavin
gavin susan and a line producer go over the figures
the only way we can afford to shoot the pilot is in canada
gavin stacks up clothes on his bed preparing to pack
its really hard to think about leaving for six weeks
gavin yells action
a steadicam follows melissa as she gets out the passenger door of a toyota prius an alarmed look on her face
a driver holds up a sign for taylor
gavin approaches waves to him
he has a laptop bag over his shoulder
titles identify him as
gavin taylor creator showrunner gavin unlocks the door entering from the driveway
hes hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag
note this is the same house from part one
we hear the clatter of toenails on hardwood floors
gavin kneels down to greet
gavins pugs pounce all over him
gavin is on the cordless phone talking with a friend as he sorts through massive piles of mail
on his left wrist we notice the same green string bracelet gary wore in part one
its weird being back
it doesnt feel like my house anymore
gavin sits at the piano pecking out a haunting melody hes been fiddling with
he grabs a red diskette and a sharpie
at this stage you have the script you wrote and the film you shot but you dont know how its all going to come together
you just know how you want it to feel
he writes knowing on the diskette and pops it into the disclavier unit
susan gavin and the editor watch the cut
susan is taking notes on a legal pad
susan flips to her next note
titles list her position as
susan howard vp drama development i just dont know if you need the cold open
people want to get right to the story
angle on the editor bristling a bit
i invited susan to see a rough cut because i trust her taste
intercut editing suite
could we be more clear why mary is so freaked out at that moment
i thought it was pretty obvious
more importantly i trust her as a barometer of rogers taste
but thats rogers big thing this season
never let the audience be confused
the editor hands melissa a microphone
titles list her simply as melissa mccarthy mary so were trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of noelle
the monitor shows a three second clip
its melissa and a eight year old actress noelle in a car
melissas character looks alarmed by something the girl has just done or said
whats the line
quickly how could you
it sounds like kosher drug paraphernalia
like come on shmuley
have a toke on the howkajew
its just for the test screening
they really think people wont get it
the dumb people might not
i didnt think we were making the show for dumb people
melissa holds a microphone
as video footage plays back we hear three evenly spaced looping beeps
where the fourth one would be melissa says the line
again how could you
again how couldjew
finished she hands the mic back to gavin
i feel so dirty
thats how i like ya
a moderator explains how it all works to the recruited audience
the test begins
angle on a monitor
we see a scene of melissa as mary on a forest road
through a one way mirror gavin and susan watch as the moderator asks a group of twelve male viewers about the pilot they just watched
their comments are mostly positive
gavin and susan share relieved looks
she has a notepad as always
one agitated man keeps staring at the mirror right at gavin
we recognize him as the parole officer from part one
that guys looking at me
he cant see you
as a test gavin waves his arm
the agitated mans expression changes slightly but its not clear whether its in reaction or not
the moderator directs her next question to the agitated man
how about you
did you feel it was
its not real
and what do you mean by that
the shows not real
why cant you see that
are you fucking blind
looking at the mirror you think youre above it all dont you
you are trapped here with the rest of them brother
he stands up pushing past the other people to come right up to the one way glass
he stares directly at gavin even though he shouldnt be able to see him
he shouts get out
gavin backs away from the glass freaked out
impromptu interview with gavin standing beside his prius
hes clearly still shaken by the experience
the guy was crazy
the show is kinda twisted and it just flipped something in him
gavin sounds like hes trying to convince himself
what did he say
what do you think it means
other than the world is coming to an end
oblivio also means forgetting forgetfulness
jump cut i think thats what im going to do
gavin hosts a game night good friends and lots of cocktails
the guests include melissa and susan along with sam tom bruce dana jon kevin jeff dan and carl
we dont show anyones names
theyre playing celebrity
we go several rounds keeping the best of whats said
between rounds of celebrity party goers mingle
gavin is making a new batch of cocktails he obviously has a knack for it
susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay
did you have a chance to look at the cards yet
from the screening
melissa reaches in grabbing the vodka
daddy needs his drink
she makes a quick cape cod
from the other room sam yells woman wheres my cocktail
yelling back im a comin
to gavin i still love you most
she gives him a quick peck then dashes off with sams drink
continuing her thought people write stuff on the cards they wont say in a focus group
they get more specific
he shakes the mixer
roger has this advice i always remember
forget about anyone who scores you in the twos and threes
theyll never like your show
instead look for the nines
theyre the one who think your show is almost the best thing theyve ever seen
they get your vision
they just want it to be even better
melissa yells from the living room round two is starting without you
so youll look at the cards
making his way back to the living room he stops by the phone
pulls out an orange post it and makes a note
as he leaves we go in close to read it sometimes the numbers point things out that you dont want to admit to yourself
in this case melissa
insert comment cards
her overall scores were okay
but if you look at the people who scored the show highest the one consistent dip was melissa
susan and gavin are having lunch
she doesnt have a ton to do in the pilot
theres so much to set up you dont get a lot of melissa time
thats one of the challenges with a premise pilot
but the network still likes the show
roger is your biggest cheerleader
how about above roger
roger calls the shots
after he consults with the higher powers
do they like the show
they havent seen it
theyre watching all the pilots on friday
why are you focusing on melissa
because shes the biggest concern
shes also the biggest star in the show
no youre the biggest star
roger made a huge deal with you and he went along with casting melissa when that wasnt his instinct
well hooray for roger
i dont understand what you want me to do
meet with someone
gavin drops his fork so that it will clatter on his plate
the network has a holding deal with her
and you put her in gatins pilot
but the network loves dahlia
so if she could jump over to your show
replace melissa and reshoot the pilot
roger would pay for it
gavin is nauseous
he has to take a drink to be able to speak
so is this even about melissa
its about getting your show on the air
thats all that matters in the end
gavin meets with dahlia salem
shes pretty funny and very cool
they talk about the other pilot gatins the role and how fucked up it is to be having these double top secret conversations
it goes well
they seem to genuinely like each other
dahlia is gone
interview with gavin
i see why the network loves her
its just i wrote the part for melissa
shes one of my best friends
and in my head i only see melissa for the role
jump cut could dahlia do it
it could work
i just dont know if i want it to work
a empty storefront in koreatown both walls lined with computers for the customers playing high end videogames
we see gavin playing
his interview is intercut with his intense focus on the screen as he plays bad day l
when i get stressed out i play videogames
its my therapy
i cant have them on my own computer because then id never write
so i come down to koreatown
videogames are better than real life
when you get stuck you can always hit reset
life needs a reset button
gavins on the phone
if were really going to replace melissa i want to hear it from roger
susan talks to the speakerphone
rogers on a flight to london
but i talked with him before he left
he said yes on dahlia
what does that mean
it means yes
yes replace melissa
he wants your show on the air starring dahlia
i just got off the phone with her agents
they love it
she loves you
what about melissa
you want me to call her agents
ill tell her
gavin hangs up
we stay on his side of the conversation
in the background we see the door to the driveway swing open by itself
a beat later it slams shut
gavin is understandably startled
melissa wearing a nuns habit sings as long as he needs me
a pianist is rehearsing with her
as long as he needs me i know where i must be
intercut with on camera interview in between the pilot and the series im trying to squeeze in a one woman show
edit ive always been obsessed with nuns
theyre sort of like gods fag hags
melissa spots gavin entering and sings the rest of the song to him
gavin and melissa have martinis
i think my house is haunted
your house is really old
ever since i got back i feel like theres someone else there
and then last night i thought i heard something
a woman singing
like a ghost
and then i saw something
i ran into someone
it was a man
i think it was me
a beat while melissa processes
your house is haunted by yourself
gavin are you alright
he takes a long beat psyching himself up
what spills out is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed
the network wants to replace you
oh my god
and im letting them because i really want the show on the air
i have all these characters inside my head and they want to live
im the only way they can
this is the only way they can
i have five seasons mapped out and though it sucks either you go away or the show goes
i had to make a decision and thats the decision i made
by the end of it we can hear the emotion in his voice
melissa takes a beat to process
so its done
its not your fault
youre morally incapable of doing the right thing
gavin doesnt rise to the challenge
dont get me wrong
i think you do feel bad for me
but thats all you feel for me
you still see me as the fat girl you call on friday night when a date falls through
lets go to a movie
lets go to fubar
and if you meet a hot piece of ass dont worry about melissa you can apologize tomorrow
its not like were actually friends
i dont want to do this on camera
no because you cant control it
your little puppets are off their strings running around
saying things you didnt write
reality terrifies you
the reality is you would not be here without me
i gave you your first few roles
and your career is a result of that
with exaggerated relief
god thank you
thank you for finally playing that card
i always knew you were holding onto it the i invented melissa mccarthy card
congratulations you win
the game is over
she gets up to go then decides she has one more thing to say
dont you ever pity me again
she leaves him sitting at the table
new music for a change of mood upbeat excited
upfronts is the week each year when the networks present their fall schedule to advertisers
sort of like heres our new shit
edit upfronts is a complete oxymoron because no one is remotely honest
the schedule is a secret until its announced so everything is still in play
at least youre in new york
gavin watches manhattan roll by out the windows
gavin tips the driver and wheels his luggage into a skyscraper hotel
gavin opens the door to room
gavin checks out the view
we go close on a card which reads congrats
love roger susan and everyone at the network it came with a fruit tray
gavin alone is headed down to the lobby
impromptu interview continues its surreal being here
none of this is how i planned it
the elevator stops at another floor
camera doesnt look as the doors open but gavin spots someone he knows
turn to find dahlia salem
shes hesitant to get on the elevator
youre doing your
she means the camera filming them
come join reality television
she steps on
hits the button for lobby
when did you get in
this whole last hours has been surreal
i just said surreal
i wanted to call you
i dont sleep
i just felt weird about what happened
not sure hes following
did something happen
near the hotel gavin is on his cell phone
so i just bumped into dahlia salem star of my show
titles indicate gavins on the phone with his agents
who tells me gatins show got picked up so no she wont be in my show which makes me wonder does my show even exist
as he listens to the other side we hear a distant boom and then a rush like autumn leaves blowing down a street
gavin reacts though none of the passersby seem to hear it
back to the conversation
no ive left word with roger
ive left word with susan
its like theyve dropped off the face of the earth
susan is on her phone
at the same time shes plowing through email on her blackberry
right now the whole schedules in flux
you get these missives from roger and the higher powers
but youre not sure what they add up to
right now i cant say for certain whether knowing will end up on the schedule at all
gavin talks with john gatins whos doing abs on an exercise ball
john gatins creator showrunner paradise fields look im sorry
but im kind of not
i want my show on the air
and i think it was shitty for you to go after dahlia behind my back
i heard your show was gone
i heard you fired melissa mccarthy without having a backup
why would they pick up your show when you dont have a star
the network wanted dahlia
yeah in my show
we tested right before you
our numbers were through the roof
whos your exec
she would know
she was there
susan is on her cell phone
a cocktail party is in full swing nearby
we can hear the din and music and see the occasional guest looking for the restrooms
on phone im at the uta party
did you hear about rickys assistant
she literally shat herself
no i saw it
in the background we see gavin approaching
susan spots him and seizes up a bit
she holds up a one sec finger to him as she continues her conversation
i will break your fucking finger
to phone ill call you back
she hangs up
they look each other in the eye daring each other to go first
roger wanted to talk to you personally
theyre only picking up two dramas
the rest is what reality
you can go mid season
you can go to hell
she takes a beat trying to size him up
you think i deliberately sabotaged your show
im on your side
trust me im the only one who is trying to protect you
protect me from what
there is so much more going you are psychotic
on than you
all i want to know is why
you want a motive
this isnt crime lab
no one got murdered
my show did
so tell me why
i had to get you away from her
she was holding you back
you had to give her up
beat cmon g
if she really mattered you couldnt have betrayed her so easily
what youre the victim
the big creator cant stand up to one little d girl
it was your choice
i didnt make you do anything
i mean do you have any principles
do you believe in anything but your own ego
your dialogue used to be sharper
maybe gatins could do a polish
he suddenly punches her one hit to the face
she drops hard
gavin takes a step back
tasting blood susan gets to her knees
a wry smile
is that all there is
in the background we see partygoers responding to the blow
susan gets to her feet
she approaches gavin hands open
shes not going to hit him
do you feel like a man
because ill tell you a secret
she leans in very close to his ear
theres a strange intimacy between them
whisper youre not
she walks away
close on gavin
we move with gavin as he walks
hes trying to get away from the camera but it keeps following him
he reaches a crosswalk
he has to wait for the light
finally he looks into camera look i dont want to do this anymore
my shows not going to happen so this show is over
i m not going to be your fucking puppet
are you alright
gavin looks left where an african american woman is waiting for the same crosswalk
we recognize her as octavia the streetwalker from part one
who were you talking to
gavin looks back towards camera a strange expression
we see gavin and the woman on the corner
theres no camera gavin could have been talking to
hes understandably perplexed where did the documentary crew go
was there ever anyone there
our camera style has changed instead of handheld and jerky were smooth and slow
the music has completely changed underscoring a sense of creeping dread
we hold for a long beat
the light changes
still a little unnerved octavia begins to cross the street
only then do we notice something unusual floating above her head wider we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their
no one seems to see the lights other than gavin
gavin looks around in uneasy fascination as if hes just landed on an alien world
a beat then he has an unsettling thought
he slowly looks up
above his own head he sees the same sphere of light only his is bright white
we pull back rising up to a perspective above and behind gavin
as we do the edges of the frame creep in revealing icons and unintelligible statistics changing moment by moment
a dialog box appears in the center of the screen reading
unsaved changes will be lost
cancel exit an arrow slides back and forth between to the two options
finally it lands on exit
x x were continuing an earlier scene from the end of part one
i can understand why youre a little confused
im a lot confused
this is all a dream
im in a coma
then im dead
this is hell or purgatorium or something
okay a purgatorium is where romans vomited
this is as real as anything can be
suspicious what does that mean
she sits forward in her chair
by instinct he sits back
everything is what it is
but youre not who you think you are
who am i
with practiced calm
youre a multi dimensional being of vast almost infinite power
you created this world on a whim and decided to stick around to see how it turned out
you this body youre in is just one of your incarnations
call you what you will
not sure he follows
are you saying im god
if god is a ten a theoretical ultimate that which no greater can be imagined youre more of a nine
so what are you
humans are sevens
monkeys are sixes
what are the eights
plus they control the weather
she didnt mean to get on that tangent
whats important is that you youre the big cheese
you could destroy the world with a single thought
suddenly dont incidentally
just file that away
but the truth is you hold all the cards every church every candle every sacrifice thats for you
when people pray theyre not praying because they want this thing or that thing
they just dont want to be forgotten
so you understand i would have told you earlier but i didnt
but i dont believe you
he gets up to exit
this is where we jump cut time earlier
part three in a wide shot we see a vast field bordered by green mountains
unseen birds call out from the trees while insects click and whirr
in the distance we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way
its a family father gabriel wife mary and daughter noelle
theyre returning from a short day hike
mary carries a small videocamera
seeing that noelle is already a ways down the path
dont get too far ahead
noelle turns around
instead of speaking she moves her hands in sign language
shes mute not deaf
you had ice cream at lunch
noelle begs to differ
to mary apparently frozen yogurt doesnt count
ill make note
the family walks up to their car a blue toyota prius
gabriel sheds his daypack trying to open the hatchback
it wont lift
mary goes to open the passenger door
did you hit it
shouldnt have to
he fishes the keys out of his pocket
presses the remote entry button repeatedly
gabriel tries to open the drivers side door
even noelle knows somethings wrong
gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob
unlocks the door and climbs in
opens the door for mary and noelle
i think we left the overhead light on
he taps it
moves the switch
noelle signs her made up representation of shit
gabriel slides the key into the slot
battery is dead
least the starter is
noelle leans forward aware that this is something serious
how do we
we call the service
thats all we can do
its just the little battery thats dead right
the big one is probably fine
we cant jump it from one battery to the other
cross over somehow
who did you marry
he gets out of the car retrieving his cell phone
mary follows him out
noticing that hes not dialing
are you getting a signal
she checks her phone
a long beat
theyre both relieved
finding the aaa card in his wallet gabriel takes the phone and dials
its at this moment we notice the familiar green string bracelet around gabriels wrist
in the back seat noelle knocks on the window
she signs asking if everything is okay
daddys calling people to help us
gabriel pulls the phone from his ear
looks at the screen
the minute you try to place a call the bar goes away
okay ill keep trying mary
but it will keep happening
well what do you want to do
i dont know
he tries redial
maybe if you hold it up higher
humoring her he holds it at arms length
the problem is were boxed in
its a canyon
where we turned off the main road it was more open
and higher too
thats at least a mile
i can run that
we stay here
you okay with that
i dont think we have a choice so yeah
half a beat while each waits for the other to think of a better plan
gabriel leans down next to noelles window
daddys going to get a truck to help us out
you take care of your mom okay
ill be right back
gabriel gives mary a quick peck and starts running down the road
we move in on noelle who smiles a little
gravel crunches under gabriels shoes as he runs
he keeps an easy pace
in various shots we get a sense of the distance hes travelling
he passes gulches meadows and boulder fields
he finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger
pulling out marys cell phone gabriel tries to get a signal
by his reaction its still iffy
he dials but the call drops
just the same
he looks left
looks back down the dirt road
he decides to head off to the right downhill
we catch up to gabriel as hes walking in the middle of the road still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal
in the distance he spots a patch of moving color a female hiker
a moments hesitation then he yells out to her excuse me
she stops turns
gabriel jogs to close the distance
as we approach we reveal sierra
in the past years shes made a fresh start times
in this incarnation shes a wilderness loving bush hating wildly overeducated clerk at trader joes in venice
do you have a cell phone
no i dont
theres no service up here
re his phone yeah im finding that out
you can usually get a signal up at the ranger station
she points in the opposite direction back the way he came
you follow the road
i dont know
you have a car
thats why i need
she pulls a stray hair back from her mouth
notices him noticing her
she takes a subtle step closer to the center of the road
are you headed back to your car now
if you could give me a ride to a gas station wherever
she doesnt leap to extend an invitation
it takes a beat for gabriel to figure out why
look im not some crazy ted bundy guy
im not going to rape you or kill you or anything
she doesnt seem reassured
of course thats what ted bundy would say
look im a videogame designer
fishing through wallet my wife is an editor
my daughter is four
he offers her a family photo
she looks at it but doesnt take it
theyre waiting back at the car and i want to get some help before it gets dark
i can call somebody when i get to town
trying to temper his frustration
i believe you
but you dont know where the car is
and the guy might not come
we cant be up here all night
sierra backs away
dont be sorry
just help me out here
once she feels shes reached a good distance she turns and keeps walking
why wont you trust me
she doesnt turn back heading down the road
mary is sitting in the back seat of the prius with noelle whos getting tired of her coloring book
noelle signs something to mary who considers the request
okay but you have to be careful understand
you have to use big girl hands
mary hands her the small video camera
noelle has some trouble folding out the little screen but eventually gets it open without any help from her mom
do you want to see where we were today
mary takes the camera back for a second flipping it to playback mode and rewinding
the blocky video footage zips past
okay now hit play
on the tiny screen we see noelle and her father eating lunch by a waterfall
mary is filming
and theres daddy
youre a little movie star huh
hell be back soon
dont you worry
gabriel continues walking headed back in the direction he came
from behind him
he turns finding her a ways back
were you following me
once i was sure you werent following me
im sorry its just
you thought i was ted bundy
my names gabriel
weird that theres no cars
im parked that way
she points off the road through the forest
its not that far
if you want ill give you a ride to town
make up some karma
lead the way
they cross off the pavement descending into a dark forest
gabriel walks with sierra
the trees here are taller creating a cathedral like ceiling above them
i kind of recognized you
i wasnt sure but i think i saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had
youre like the shit
youre like the quentin tarantino of that world
a videogame god
you seriously recognized me off of one photo
i thought you were kinda hot
within the subset of videogame people
i wasnt masturbating to your picture or anything
well i guess im flattered
you should be
im stingy with compliments
so your boyfriend plays videogames
way too many
he used to play evercrack back in the day but yours well that was like
whats worse than crack
he was this orc witch doctor guy
at one point he was spending like hours a week gathering thunderleaf or whatever
then i was his mule hauling it around because he ran out of space
you had an account
i was part of your world and you didnt even know it
you can make it up to me
mary is pacing but trying not to look like shes pacing
she holds the other cell phone gabriels which she turns on and off hoping that somehow shell get a signal
each time she turns it on we hear the chimes
noelle is still playing with the video camera watching footage of the hike
she decides to wind back further
close on the blocky pixels rushing past
noelle hits play
for now we just hear the audio
i have five seasons mapped out and though it sucks either you go away or the show goes
i had to make a decision and thats the decision i made
we reveal the screen
were watching the argument between gavin and melissa from part
so its done
confused noelle looks out at her mother mary who is still pacing with the cell phone
its not your fault
youre morally incapable of doing the right thing
noelle rewinds further
blocky pixels rush past as we
sierra continues to lead the way
she seems confident where shes headed even though theres no real path
during the conversation we notice a small tattoo on her right shoulder blade ix
so you play a lot of characters at once
most people do
youre not most people
you created the world
you know all the secret codes
what like god mode
thats what you call it
thats when you have all the powers and you cant be killed
its fine when youre designing but its really boring to play
a game isnt fun unless there are rules
and you make the rules
yes i do
i mean you want to give everyone freedom but they cant handle it
half your players are teenage boys and its like theyre programmed to be destructive
they deliberately crash the world servers
theyd ruin everything just to prove they could
sarah offers gary her water bottle which he gladly takes
out of nowhere
do you think im pretty
she stops turning to face him
do you think im hot
on a purely physical level
thats a rave
well i dont know why youre asking
my ex boyfriend the orc he says what i like about you is that youre not so hot that im afraid of losing you
so wheres the orc now
i spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of ghb
he hallucinated went into convulsions and died
he screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back
remind me not to piss you off sarah
he could have sworn her name was sarah
and what makes you think you havent pissed me off already
she smiles keeps walking
mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car
noelle is still in back watching footage on the video camera
how are you doing kiddo
noelle doesnt look up
i was thinking we could all go to el cholo for dinner
how would you feel about some blue corn enchiladas
should we ask daddy when he gets back
without looking up
hes not coming back
mary is stunned
for her part noelle seems to have no idea she just spoke her first words
we hear three evenly spaced beeps
after the third one mary says how could you
its like someone walked over her grave
noelle hands her the camera
the footage is cued to earlier in part where gavin is having melissa loop in a wild line howkajew
how could you
how could you
beat i feel so dirty
thats how i like ya
mary backs out of the car as if trying to get away from the video camera
but shes still holding it
she hits stop
tries to collect herself
noelle gets out of the car but doesnt approach
she signs mommy
mary backs away
gabriel and sierra stop for a moment so he can pull off his outer shirt
for the first time we see that gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this hes sweating a lot
am i crazy or is it getting hotter
oh youre crazy
she hands him back the water bottle
he gladly drinks
when she takes the bottle back she steps forward
the motion leaves them face to face
she pauses for a moment just long enough for him to turn away
she kisses him
he doesnt really kiss back but he doesnt fight it either
she puts a hand on his thigh sliding up the inside
only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back
i have a wife
and a daughter
theyre waiting for me
where are they
back at the car
i mean which direction
gabriel turns trying to get his bearing
the trees blur
he nearly falls over
he manages to steady himself
face it g
you dont know where they are
you dont know where you are
weve been walking in circles for an hour
wheres your car
there is no car
that was all a
whats the word pretense i guess
an excuse to get you alone
wobbling gabriel sits down on a stump
sierra kneels down in front of him
its probably just the ghb
in the water
she holds up the water bottle
gabriel experienced the flashbacks
he felt time move
im sorry it had to come this g
but itll all be over soon
youre trying to kill me
this isnt a murder
its an intervention
images to accompany previous dialogue
i had to get you away from her
she was holding you back
you had to give her up
i can you out of here
but you have to trust me
do you feel like a man
gabriel dry heaves
sierra rubs his shoulders
just let it go
let it go
shes genuinely empathetic she doesnt enjoy his suffering
why are you doing this
you did it to yourself
admitting that is the first step
she comes around to face him
and now we see theyre not alone
two other familiar faces approach the parole officer agitated man and
theyre nines as well
youre a crack head g
the thing is this planet these people theyre your drug of choice
the next sequence bridges multiple earlier scenes from parts one and two
gary gavin gabriel has one conversation with sarah susan sierra but its broken up among previous scenes and locations sometimes for just a line
its not that hard to make a universe
at first you just checked in every once in a while
see how the neanderthals were doing
move some continents around
but then you got more into it
starting playing a couple of characters of your own
pretty soon you were playing
how long have i
youve been gone for four thousand years
not that time means the same for us but
you came looking for me
thats what a girl does
x x streetwalker octavia leans in garys car window
because you forgot who you were
x x the agitated man leans up to the one way glass
you forgot this wasnt real
we couldnt just storm in on a fiery chariot
its your universe
we had to play by your rules
we had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was
dont get me wrong this world is nice
but do you remember where you came from
a few beats while it comes back to him
tears start to build in his eyes
what hes picturing is unspeakably beautiful
it was warm
x x the agitated man parole officer attaches garys anklet
you cant describe it with human words
x x octavia leans over gary who has fallen off the bed
you cant think it with human thoughts
thats why you have to come back
come back with us
mary is sitting on the road
noelle has her chin on her mothers shoulder watching the videotape with her
on screen with tinny audio from scene you could destroy the world with a single thought
suddenly dont incidentally
just file that away
but the truth is you hold all the cards every church every candle every sacrifice thats for you
when people pray theyre not praying because they want this thing or that thing
they just dont want to be forgotten
mary is still watching the tape
she realizes noelle isnt watching over her shoulder anymore
mary looks around
her daughter is nowhere to be seen
gabriel and sierra are back at the junction where the paved road meets the gravel road
maybe if i just cut back didnt get so involved
we both know thatll never work
next week youll be back here redesigning the pinecones
you have to quit cold turkey
but i cant force you to leave
you have to want it
she takes his hand running a finger through the green string bracelet around his wrist
she kisses him
and then shes gone
gabriel stands there for a long beat considering his decision
x x panicking mary calls out for noelle
shes nowhere to be found
then from behind her
gabriel is walking up the gravel road with noelle holding his hand
i didnt forget you guys
mary regards him as a familiar stranger a beloved imposter
lets go home
music begins a song that will carry us through the next sequence
gabriel climbs into the drivers seat
both mary and noelle watch with interest as he pushes the start button
the car beeps and engages without any problem
everyone fastens their seatbelts
the prius drives down the gravel road
mary tries to keep her eyes on the scenery but they keep drifting over to gabriel trying to read what hes thinking
the prius turns on to the paved road
headlights switch on
the metal gate at the top of the driveway swings open squealing on its rusty hinges
gabriel lifts the sleeping noelle out of the car
carries her into the house
mary shuts the door behind them
taking off her shoes gabriel tucks noelle into bed
turns on a nightlight for her
gabriel brushes his teeth with an electric toothbrush while mary reads a magazine on the toilet
gabriel switches off the light
he spoons mary who kisses his hand
on both mary and gabriels faces we see anxiety
things left unsaid
gabriel lies awake staring at the ceiling
gabriels bare feet walk down the carpeted stairs
gabriel stares at the three paintings on the wall
gabriel stands in the doorway looking out at the inky blue sky
his eyes are red tired
he hasnt slept at all
its very quiet except for the occasional precocious bird mary enters from the living room still in her pajamas
he knows shes there
neither wants to speak
you need to go dont you
i can stay
every day youd know what you were missing
he smiles a little
if you go
worst case scenario
spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void
the end of everything
that probably wouldnt happen
the basic structure of the universe should hold
i guess im just worried about the human factor
you guys kill each other a lot
in fairness thats usually in your name
plus weve gotten much more efficient at it
i like this world
i like my life here with you and noelle
but its not real
im not really your wife youre not really my husband
on some level its all pretend
its not pretend
theres a reason you were there in every version
you were my sister my wife my best friend
thats a little creepy
i wanted you close
in one version i even told you
i warned you that some day they might come for me and
youd have to leave
how many versions were there
this is the last one
ive destroyed billions of people with a thought
and youd like to think its painless
you dont have to explain or apologize
everything that is is because of you
if thats all thats enough
with that theres really nothing more to say
guess you dont really need to pack anything
its been a pleasure
i love you
love you too
ya big lug
he kisses her
its not a big passionate movie ending kiss but rather a fond kiss farewell
at the end of it he whispers into her ear youre my favorite
with two fingers gabriel breaks the green string bracelet around his left wrist
and in that moment a film passes over him like the boundary between water and air
hes stepped out of this dimension
mary is frozen with the same smile on her face but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two dimensional images
she and everything around her has become like wallpaper slowly curling away revealing emptiness beneath
gabriel collapses into a single spiky sphere of light
the light moves through the kitchen creating waves that ripple through the tissue thin walls
picking up speed the sphere rushes through the window heading west
as the light flies out over hancock park the mansions and skyscrapers seem unreal like models
reaching santa monica we pass over the ferris wheel at the end of the pier
we dive into the blue ocean beneath us which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness
we see three lights in the distance
we join them moving with them
further ahead more lights circling
its a loose spiral made of stars resembling nothing so much as the number
as we get closer and closer we
hands reach up expecting to find glasses but there are none
as we pull out we reveal its not mary melissa or margaret but a fourth person just slightly different from any of them
well call her m
she looks first to the spot where gabriel was standing
honey do we have nutmeg
m looks over at husband ben who is busy making pancakes reading from a recipe
coming around from behind ben noelle checks through the spice drawer
m watches her with cautious fascination
m catches her reflection in the toaster
notices she looks different than she expected
to ben if i had a horse
noelle turns back with the spices handing them to ben one at a time
i would name her cinnamon
and if i had another horse
she beckons noelle over
tucks back the little girls hair
keeping her voice low enough so ben cant hear this is going to sound really strange but
whats my name
noelle only gives her a half crazy look
m smiles too a little embarrassed
noelle looks her right in the eye
hes not coming back
but its gonna be okay
he put the pieces together its like
the best of all possible worlds
noelle taps her nose
is it supposed to stick like this
sharing a look
we should help him
they head over to assist
we move across the family as they work on the pancakes noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be
we leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen gooey pancakes and a good life
the following scene scene is the conversation between s and g that plays near the end of part three
the plan is to shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that involves both characters be it in part one two or three
so well be shooting this scene a lot
well then be intercutting the best of all these moments to create one sequence
its not that hard to make a universe
at first you just checked in every once in a while
see how the neanderthals were doing
move some continents around
but then you got more into it
starting playing a couple of characters of your own
pretty soon you were playing
how long have i
youve been gone for four thousand years
not that time means the same for us but
you came looking for me
thats what a girl does
we couldnt just storm in on a fiery chariot
its your universe
we had to play by your rules
we had to make you see how limited and corrupt your little world was
dont get me wrong this world is nice
but do you remember where you came from
a few beats while it comes back to him
tears start to build in his eyes
what hes picturing is unspeakably beautiful
it was warm
you cant describe it with human words
you cant think it with human thoughts
beat thats why you have to come back
come back with us
