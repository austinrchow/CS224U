by peter berg september pitch black
dim faint light appears in the distance approaching growing larger
as the light nears we recognize car headlights
closer and closer until the car is bearing down upon us with great force
two men in the front seat fisher and moore
all seems quite normal until we take a closer look sweat matts hair dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are blistered and bloody
they seem almost entranced
that ought to be about the end of that
push in on fisher
the oakland raiders have taken a lead in a tough football game and this crowd is standing
playoff game between the oakland raiders and the pittsburgh steelers
scoreboard reads seconds th down yards to go th quarter
hang on to your hats here come the steelers out of the huddle
it comes down to one big play th down ten yards to go
terry bradshaw at the controls
and bradshaw back and looking
again bradshaw running out of the pocket
looking for someone to throw to
bradshaw fires it down the field and theres a collision
the ball bounces off the helmet of a raider player and is caught low by the steelers franco harris
and its caught out of the air
the ball is pulled in by franco harris
franco harris running for the end zone all but home
oncoming headlights illuminate fishers face
slowly tracking down a long line of couples
some with kids some old some young all waiting to pay their and pick up their marriage license
we hold on a young couple late s keith fisher and his fiancee liz garrety
fisher has a blondish quality to him unassuming pleasant attentive a bit more reactive than he could be
liz is quite attractive but somewhat tense and not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow moving line
this is ridiculous
why cant we do it through the mail
patient we missed the deadline
cant we do it on the phone
i dont think so
in front of them a middle aged mexican couple make out intensely while their chubby little three year old stares at liz
why is this kid staring at me
im not sure
liz pulls a note pad out of her daypack
reading from her notes did you send in all of the deposit checks
i think so
pause what do you mean you think so
i sent a lot of checks im not sure what all of them are
the wedding cake check
hotel for my parents the tent the band the judge
beat i think i forgot the tent
somewhat alarmed you forgot the tent
i think so
why did you forget the tent check
i didnt mean to liz
you cant play around with these tent people
im not playing around
what else have you forgot
how could i know what else i forgot
im working my ass off here
ive taken care of absolutely everything keith
because you wanted to
you wanted this to be your wedding not your parents
dont you dare
dont you put this on me
dont do it dont do it dont do it dont
a young teenage couple behind them stares at liz a bit confused
trying to calm her stop it
trying to control herself you know how important this is to my mother
you know that
im sorry i forgot the tent
i dont think i forgot anything else
not bitchy i bet you didnt forget the bachelor party checks
are we going to do this again
im just saying i bet those checks all found the mailboxes
i wouldnt know
it amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to vegas
patient they organized this not me
i have nothing to do with it
well its bad timing
how do you figure
right before the wedding
its a bachelor party
you sort of have to do it before the wedding
i suppose boyd is the creative force behind all this
hes a moron
hes my friend
hes not a moron
david boyd is a big sack of hot gas
tight on a fred sands realty sign being pounded into the ground
pictured on the sign as offered by is realtor david boyd ish short hair smiling with bizarre sincerity
wider to reveal david boyd in the flesh suit jacket off pounding away sinking the sign into the front yard of a cute little house
his cell phone rings
boyd gets the phone from his jacket
into phone david boyd
heres the deal were talking five guys
nice guys tina
im calling you directly so you dont have to go through the agency
suddenly over his shoulder back into phone thats correct
cash straight to you
i dont think so
its just stripping
just a show
could you please wait off the property
angle on a young couple obviously here to see the house
were just trying to sneak a peak
just stay off the property until im off the phone
cause thats the way they do it
bewildered and somewhat intimidated they back off
back into phone so its five guys hard rock casino
nine hundred bucks and you do the thing with the rubber hoses
are you in
tina are you in
boyd hangs up puts on his jacket and turns with the same bizarre insincere smile in his photo
david boyd nice to meet you
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality
what are you talking about
im talking about the kind of people you hang out with
about growing up assuming responsibility of yourself
i asked you to marry me
im ready for marriage
i just think that at some point youre going to have to re evaluate some of your friendships
charles moore for instants
you dont like moore
its not that i dont like him
but the wedding has really got me thinking and
i just keep myself opening up
and i want you keeping up with me here
what does moore have to do with your growing
i just dont see him in the big picture
ive known him since cub scouts
late twenties a chef in a very upscale very busy kitchen
his name moore is embroidered on his white chefs jacket
food orders fly all around as moore works with a mesmerizing focus a poetic sense of purpose fifteen things going on at once he chops sautes braises etc
in a perfect mute silence
he just doesnt talk a lot
whats his problem
hes a great chef
and i expect more from you
you expect more what
youre going to be hungover for three days
like those guys on oprah that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them
people are staring
ive seen it on television
im not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body
starts to cry i am not common keith
i am not common
i am a creature like no other and i will not be commoned
is that to much to ask
screaming is that to much to ask
you will not be common
finally at the head of the line liz steps up to the clerk
marriage license please
fisher and liz emerge start for the parking lot
liz stops to look at fisher her eyes well with tears vulnerable and apologetic
do you love me
with all my heart
vulnerable kiss me
fisher takes her into his arms pulls her to him kisses her hard for all its worth
desk after desk after desk of identical men seemingly repeating the same task
we find fisher at one of the desks number crunching
at the desk across from fisher sits
michael brenn short compact with a severe personality disorder masquerading as semi appropriate behavior
thats just insecurity
i dont know
shes really been stressing out
nut crunching gut splinters
what does that mean
it means shes insecure
michaels phone rings
picks up mike brenn
hangs up im amazed the windows dont blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed ass puckering rage in these soul less lizards
beat i just want her to be happy
same alarm clock every morning same two pops on the same snooze button
phone rings picks up michael brenn
looking through stacks of stats hold your horses
hangs up same shower towel toothbrush razor hair gel
its a fucking epidemic fisher and you better start addressing it
youre getting married and im not going to candy coat it
it just gets worse
its an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body
fisher looks pale
im not breathing right
youre not breathing right
lately ill just start getting lightheaded dizzy and i realize i havent breathed in like two minutes
adam brenn michaels older brother mid s a bit soft in the belly approaches more or less in charge

fishers phone rings
picks up keith fisher
liz sits at the kitchen table in a mild panic
into phone weve got problems here
intercut liz and fisher
keith do not trivialize this
whats the problem

what kind of seats can we have

come send me off
boyd moore fisher in the middle michael and his older brother adam all in suits pose in front of adams brand new state of the art chevy minivan while adams
very aggressive wife lois mired in domestic resentment focuses her camera
notice how clean and well behaved they all appear respectable members of modern society
timmy adam jr
take a good look at this
adams and lois kids timmy and adam jr
watch with liz
in leg braces and crutches suffers from muscular dystrophy we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in hours no matter how low how
regression of modern man to his most primitive ape like state
the stone age
the post vegas man
a mutant species
okay boys smile
lois clicks off photos of the men
as you were
the guys break
fisher goes to liz
will you please call the chair people
do you love me
just call and let me know that your okay
i love you

adam kisses lois and the kids goodbye
nearly looses his balance in the excitement adam catches him
boyd starts to get in the drivers seat
not on your life
boyd slides over shotgun cranks the music
fishers the last one in
he slides the big minivan door shut and theyre off
adam looks in the rearview mirror lois liz timmy wave goodbye
waves one of his crutches
the minivan cruises east from santa monica through downtown los angeles and the city of industry
at the turn off a freeway sign reads las vegas miles
youre a fucking moron
its my fucking opinion
its really a stupid opinion
you have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak
because my opinion threatens yours its poorly developed
no because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about which makes of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me
boyd brought up divorce statistics
the hell i did
the hell you didnt
the hell i did
you said one in two marriages end in divorce
i never heard that
you said that boyd
well i didnt mean it
youre an asshole adam
youre an asshole
oh and why am i an asshole
i dont have to
as they ride through the lifeless desert fisher dials his cell phone
into phone is this pico party rents
can i speak to whomever is in charge of chairs
boyd checks his watch
four hours and fifteen minutes
i can make vegas in and change
im not getting a ticket

a very large exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in colorado
nobody gives a fuck
into phone no im holding for tony
that would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of million dollars
into phone we need padded chairs
or a stock kick of approximately on shares which are currently sitting around
or in plain english
what is wrong with you people
im a helper here
your investment ideas never work out
thats the whole point
they rarely work out
but on occasion they do
and when they do they do big
your ideas never work out
thats one idea
into phone no
we want padded chairs
one idea that if you had fucking listened to you would each be worth approximately million dollars
you cant keep bringing up starbucks
that was your only real hit in like tries
i set up fisher with the broker that found his house
took care of that one didnt i
beat prison communications
i dont think so boyd
dont come crying to boyd
he turns away from the guys and stares out the window
yes i was holding for tony in chairs
i have a chair problem
no im not tony i need to speak to tony
the minivan cruises through death valley in route to vegas
north of vegas
the minivan is parked high on a cliff overlooking the city
a couple of tequila bottles on ice a case of heineken
the boys are arming up
all the bullshit aside fish weve been coming up here for what eight years
boyd carving a branch with his boy scout knife
over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life
drum banging real times
theyve all been real times
and as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life as you prepare for new roles father husband teacher you will as i have come to except the
letting go of of old ways
soon the mellowing will begin
but not tonight
tonight we return once again to the cave
tonight we let the monsters out
we fill ourselves with the spirits of genghis kahn joe namath jfk paton lombardi hemingway
screaming franco mother fucking harris
keith richards dean martin
jack kerouback herman melville henry miller and hunter s
i dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing
so from sun set to sun rise let me be heard
boyd holds the bottle above his head as the guys raise their glasses in a toast
he who acts the beast rids himself of the pain of being a man
the guys smash the bottles together in an explosion of glass and the golden tequila
cash and chips play fisher on cell phone calls about the chairs again
shot after shot after shot after shot
michael throws back a shot falls off his stool
fisher sneaks a call to liz
liz is making place cards i love lucy is on the tv
teasing are you calling from jail
well the night is young

im working on it ive made three calls
beat i cant stop thinking about how much i love you
well i do
well you should
what are you doing
just a bit of organizing
im mad at you
go have fun
not too much
ill see you tomorrow
fisher hangs up a crazy about the girl smile on his face
the music is loud
the boys are super drunk in the swank bachelor party suite
moore stagger dances on a table
boyd and michael stand at the wet bar
i dont hate women
you hate women
you have a king fantasy
i am a lover
in africa you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night
and what happens when you cant
swigs whiskey looks up new king
adam and fisher
its what my father said to me
he said it and he meant it
he said to me
he said adam he said
he told me and i heard him
struggles to remember hell he said so many goddamn things i cant remember everything he said for christsake
thats exactly what im saying
my father said first of all im your father not your friend
im your father
are you solid with that
i think its fucked
then fuck what your father said cause im gonna tell you right now
youll know what its all about why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning and the streetlights coming through the
window and its just catching a corner of her face like a sleeping angel
and her hair smells sweet and shes yours
shes all yours
do you see where im going here
speed hitting cocaine
if im the king of israel i say to myself king i say to myself king
take a good look around
what do i see
israel doesnt have a king
then what do they have
they have a president
a benjamin yahoo something
i say to myself look at the map
look whats all around you
people who wish bad bad things for you and your people
for thousands of years the jews are fighting everybody
it used to be theyd throw rocks then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears
then the gunpowder revolution
now theyre shooting fire power back and forth all day bullets flying babies getting shot
whats your point
now if im the king of israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know its just a matter of time
am i right
the israelis can protect themselves
they got the mossad thing happening
mossads for real man
they scalp babies
theres my point exactly
whats your point
look up the chickens dig up the holy dirt pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long stick it all on a big
fucking tug boat
the whole country picks up and takes mexico
moore crazed with the rhythm of the chemical brothers jumps up and down on the table
fisher and adam power shooting tequila
the bucks gonna stop right here
pounds his chest if my son doesnt know the six new england states if he has trouble with geography i wont stick it in his face
ill help the little guy
ill put him in the car and take him out there
ill take him to maine for a big lobster dinner go skiing in vermont hot dogs at yankee stadium
i wont stare him down
dont ever stare him down
i wont do it
dont eyeball your kids
on the coffee table dances the beasty dance
the mexicans would love it
theyre dying for a little order down there
they need direction
they need leadership
thats what im saying
let the israelis straighten it up
they got plenty of room down there number one
plus and this is just a plus they kind of look alike the jews and the mexicans
so i think on a whole your average joe mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing
am i right
the door bell rings
i tell mine that theyre little men
i tell them theyre strong
they make me feel joy
i let em know
so they really know that i need them just as much
just as much man
and you know youre their godfather
i know and im honored
if anything ever happens to me
thats the real point here
thats what im driving for when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leaves are bare
the little trees the little fellas that the storm didnt see
the tiny little
moore is on the balcony
the strippers here
he and fisher stagger aside
boyd introduces tina a devastatingly sexy asian girl to all the boys
gentlemen this is tina
the guys wasted attempt to greet tina
whos the lucky groom
the guys point at fisher roaring
tina presses her lips to fishers ear
boyd dims the lights cranks up the music as the guys stumble for position on and around the couch
tina starts to move very sexy
michael tokes a joint
god i love women
tina dances slowly peeling off her clothes
the guys are into it
michael seems especially turned on
tina moves in on fisher starts a very nasty lap dance
somehow incorporating a rubber hose
the guys hoop and holler
michael is mesmerized
tina grinds on fishers lap touching her nipples
michaels going crazy
he tries to touch her she slaps his hand away
fisher cant take it anymore
michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat
she passes over him teasing tormenting him and settles onto adams lap
the guys roar in approval
adam turns bright red as tina arouses and rides him
michael starts to burn
the guys egg tina on she gets off on adams shyness rubs her breasts in his face
the guys are howling
tina sucks one of adams fingers into her mouth
michael looks like hes going to explode
adams overwhelmed he politely bails out
whispers to fish shes all yours fish
anything you want
happy bachelor party
jumps up ill take a ride
go for it
to tina come on
to boyd you said just dancing
re money ill take good care of you
dead flat re michael with him
beat lucky me
michael moves in on tina
hesitantly she leads him into the master bedroom
shes fucking hot
i need a drink
boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on
distorted a bit crooked
music and dialogue constantly changing levels
were not sure whos saying what
were not sure of physical geography
the one thing we are sure of is that michael is fucking the hell out of tina in the bathroom
michael works tina from behind
moore bouncing off the furniture
fisher and adam wildly high
boyd sprays beer on adam who returns fire
drunk they start wrestling throwing each other around the room knocking over furniture
michael tightly ties tinas hands behind her back with her rubber hose
oh come on
i want to play
its gonna cost extra
i will pay
fisher spraying beer all over adam and boyd as they knock a table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor
michael screwing the hell out of tina
easy baby easy
moore wildly leaps from the couch to the chair to another chair back to the couch
michael plows like a monster into tina hands tied behind her back
close on her stiletto heels digging into the marble floor
one of her heels breaks
she starts to slip
moore jumps misses the chair falling down on the glass coffee table glass explodes
tina falls michael reaches too late she cant break her fall with her hands tied behind her
shes going down
moore falls through the shattered glass to the floor
tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet
fisher adam and boyd stop brawling stare down at moore covered in glass
moore is fine not even a scratch
the guys break into roaring laughter completely hysterical shaking roaring releasing
tight shots of each howling until
one by one
they sober up
tight on fisher as his smile slowly fades to confusion he stares o
standing in the door face ghost white blood dripping from his fingers
i really fucked up
the guys rush in
stop dead in their tracks
on the floor legs twisted underneath her lies growing in a growing puddle of dark blood
silence as the guys stare trying to comprehend
dont touch her
in shock i was just playing
we were playing just playing around
examines tina shes dead
how do you know shes dead
shes got no fucking pulse
you dont know what youre doing
boyd pushes adam out of the way
starts feeling her pulse
not getting anything where do you look
what side of the neck
either side you idiot
semi gone what happened
oh my god
we were playing
she hit her head
adam moves into the living room heads for the phone
boyd intercepts him
they wrestle for the phone
what are you doing
hysterical what are you talking about
what do you think you are doing
im calling the ambulance
just wait a second
wait one second
what are you doing
calling the ambulance
why are you calling an ambulance
a reasonable point
we have to call the ambulance
fisher entering freaked
call the police
attacking michael what did you do
defensive you never heard of accidents
get off me
adam slaps michael
moore tries to break it up
everybody shut up
listen to me
listen to me
everybody just calm down a bit here
are we sure shes dead
her heads bashed in and her heart isnt beating
it was an accident
are you sure this was an accident
youre a lying deviant
what did you do
the floor was wet
why was the floor wet
i dont know why the floor was wet
fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where moore is they stare down at tina as the conversation rages in the b
listen to me
lets just take a second here and take hold of the situation ok
lets just review our options here
we have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom
call the police
call the police
okay thats one option
that is not an option
there is no multiple choice here
yes sir there sure is an option here
there are always options
on fisher and moore
ive never seen a dead person
as moore moves in transfixed to take a closer look
fuck you fucking guys
well we can definitely call the police
thats an easy call
if we call the police
silence they find a dead prostitute in the bathroom
they ask us
we say ah
our friend michael
to adam your brother
got a little out of control
they were making love
and he got a little excited
and he ah sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet while he choked her to death with a rubber hose
just giving the facts
im calling the police
what were we doing officer
why didnt we help her
were all a bit high you know bachelor party that kind of thing
fisher here is getting married in three days
he didnt have anything at all to do with it
it was all michael here
you dont play games with homicide police
there are no options here
there is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle
ive known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer take him away go on its for his own good
outraged what are you talking about
we dont have a choice here boyd
i mean what are you talking about
calm bury her out in the desert
sarcastic sure why not
we can take her out to red rock
find some quiet place
and put her in the ground
you dont just casually walk out of a vegas casino with a dead woman
we can do this
we can get her out of here
have you completely lost your mind
so you get her out of here
so you get her out into the desert somehow without anybody seeing so what you dont think at some point somebody might notice that shes gone
nobody knows shes here
i called her personally
oh for christsake boyd
somebody must know shes here
pause as the guys digest this point
her blood is all over the bathroom
id say thats a bit of a dna problem
its a marble floor we can clean it up
this is insane
whats insane is the fact that michael here put a fucking girls head through a toilet
theyll get us on accessory to murder
bullshit its not accessory
i didnt do shit
you call the cops you explain it was an accident
her fucking head was caved in
i didnt fucking do it
shes got bondage burns on her wrists
theres blow all over the room moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion
this room looks like the manson family stayed here a month
michael goes down we all go down
im not going to ruin my life over a dead whore
thats a horrible ugly comment
shes a person
falling away im getting married
ive got a wife and two boys
fisher shuffles to a corner collapses head in hands
unflappably calm lets take a vote
a simple vote
two choices we clean up the mess
bury it in the desert go home and never look back
or we can call the police
open those doors roll the dice and hope that its only michael who falls
lets take a vote
boyd looks around
raises his hand
he looks at moore
beat fucking desert
to fisher fish im really sorry
i owe you man
puts up his hand desert
all eyes on fisher no response
nobody knows shes here
all eyes on adam
he takes a while
finally how do we get her out of here
a reasonable question
wrap her up in blankets
bring the car around to the back of the hotel throw her off the balcony put her in the car
beat you dont think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony
we check out the area and wait for a time when its clear
what about the blood
someone goes to walmart gets some buckets brushes mops spic and span the works
have you ever done this before
the reality is you take away the horror of this situation take away the tragedy of the death take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you
have had conditioned beaten into your head since grade one
what are we left with
that must be moved from point a to point b
now a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line
but that line exists and i see it
i see that line
i can take care of this
the five men stop breathing
somebodys at the door
the guys stare at each other in horror
is anyone in there
boyd races to the door eyes the peephole
boyds pov through the peephole outside in the hall a man
ralph early s fairly unassuming
calls out what is it
ah yeah hi
is tina there
adam throws his head in his hands
through door what
im with tina
is she there
boyd indicates to the guys to be cool
shes not here
where is she
hold on a second
boyd turns as the guys freak
crazed bits of panicked conversation gibberish
could you open the door please
boyd moves back to the door slowly opens it
ralph steps in
takes a good look around
ralphs pov of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five severely traumatized men
so whos the lucky guy
beat you all dudes from l
doing the bachelor party thing
the black bitch
all day every day
beat wheres tina
shes in the bathroom
shes still working
shes still working
ralph checks the rest of the guys
some strange eye contact
is everything okay
indicating bathroom im gonna just tell her im waiting
he starts for the bathroom
shes in there
im just gonna let her know im here
and ralph is on his way to the bathroom
and the guys are freaking as ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the bathroom
hand on door opening door stepping in and ralph sees tina
ralph in shock staring back peddles
as ralph starts to turn no
on boyd his boy scout knife raised above his head driving it into ralphs neck
major arterial spray as ralphs jugular is severed
boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom
dont let him bleed on the carpet
and moore is there
helping boyd wrestle the screaming thrashing ralph into the bathroom
ralph fights like a gilled marlin
they shove him into the bathroom
boyd slams the door shut
holds it tight as ralph tries to force it back open
hell bleed out
hell bleed dry
help me hold the door
and help they do
michael moore and adam all hold the door shut as ralph continues to fight for his life
slowly the force of his pounding eases
we hear ralph slowing down
the thrashing slows
the moans quiet
just a slight gurgle
ralph is going
ralph is gone
eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door
devastating silence as the guys attempt to process this the latest of developments
with fisher staring blotto
the door slowly opens
boyd first then the rest of the guys heads slowly appear in the doorway
and moore is out the door racing for a garbage can to relieve himself
an absolute blood bath
the walls are covered with ralphs arterial spray
tina lies still dead on her side
ralph has somehow assumed the position dead head in the bathtub
a bizarre and gruesome sight
boyd surveys the carnage takes charge
with military precision all right people
not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan
beyond shock im calling the police
so help me god you touch that phone and i bury you with them
beat surrender is no longer an option
i repeat it is not an option
is there anyone who does not understand that
fishers response is to join moore as he searches for a garbage can to puke in
michael just stares
a little gut check time fellas
a time for some serious self exploration
how do i function
no more bullshit
can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas
when they wont play my fucking song
do you get me
do you get me
not a problem
understand not my words but follow my orders
follow my orders the boys move down the isles of the massive hour everything store boyd pushes a cart grabbing cleaning supplies tarp tape giant pruning shears etc
we will organize we will mobilize we will maximize and prioritize
moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in it for all hes worth
the boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the casino with their supplies
late night gamblers pay them little notice
boyd turns up the music
lets do it people
moore and fisher scrub blood from the carpet
fisher keeps forgetting to breath
michael and boyd put tina and ralph in the bath tub
adam sits in shock on the floor
fisher and moore try to fix a broken chair
boyd starts to dismember ralph with the pruning shears like cutting the joints of a roasted chicken
adam stares at the wall
michael wraps one of ralphs feet in plastic puts it in a suitcase
fisher and moore clean
adam slowly straightens up a lamp begins to help
until the last of the body parts tinas head is wrapped in plastic packed in a suitcase
the bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up
just a bit of blood left in the tub
boyd looks pleased
looking good people
the minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snails pace
adam drives cringing with every bump and bang
everyone is tense
boyd eyes the clock
sun rises at
im not wrecking the transmission
the guys off loading the suitcases
fisher and boyd digging holes
they start putting the suitcases in the holes
wait a minute
we cant do this
weve already done this
no i mean the suitcases
we cant bury them in suitcases
how do you figure
according to jewish law the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being
they must be buried together or their souls wont rest in peace
so thats what were doing
no were not
the bodies are all mixed up
we cant do this to them
they dont have jews in asia
that is absolutely not true
beat well what the fuck are we supposed to do
as if reasonable open the suitcases unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs
it has to be done
we have to get going
i am not flexible on this
lets do it
the guys start breaking down the body parts ripping open cases
i got her arm
heres his head
as the guys put limbs with bodies
dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they are all completely buried
as the last of the dirt is packed down by boyd
the guys stare down at the grave site
now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing
its not a good thing
but it was given the circumstances the smart play
we did what had to be done
im proud of us
im proud of each and every one of us
under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations we stood fast and we delivered
i feel proud
we are all going straight to hell
either hell or prison whichever comes first
that is flat out wrong
hell is for cowards for hypocrites who fear to live by the strength of their own convictions
this is war
given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not we have chosen life over death
two wrongs dont make a right
so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here not less
i dont know man
it just seems to me that ever since you took tony robbins self help thing
youre all fucked up in the head
i got to agree with that
that is a load of shit
personal power has nothing to do with any of this
tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly yes but to give him credit for this for all of this
well thats just more than the man deserves
i think we should say some words over the grave
what kind of words
im talking about prayer
fisher steps to the grave looks down
i dont know how to pray
just go ahead and say whats on your mind
speak from the heart my brother
adam turns in disgust
this is pathetic
turning on michael what did you say
pointing youre not a team player
dont point at me
you never were a team player
thats why you never had any friends
i have plenty of friends
the hell you do
the hell i dont
you have acquaintances business friends and superficial golf buddies
you have always been a fringe player
you have some serious male on male intimacy problems
what are you fucking talking about
michael looks at boyd
michael now is probably not the best time for this
no this is the perfect time
this is real time
your brother and i as well as several others present have always suspected that you
points to adam are a fully repressed living in major denial locked down fly boy butt fucker
adam stares stupefied at boyd then michael
finally fisher says his prayer
dear god please forgive us for what we have done here tonight
we have lost our way
speaking for myself let me say
fishers prayer over the guys driving home
each lost in his own thoughts
i am deeply in love with the woman i am about to marry and i look very much forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society
we promise if you forgive us we will never forget this tragedy and will try with all our powers to use it as a daily reminder that we are here
on earth to do good not evil
let us go from this day forward with new purpose and spirit
you have given us a second chance and let us take that second chance and use it as fuel to feed our fires of productivity so that the spirits of
the two we now bury live on forever in the good deeds and positive achievements we from this moment on shall make our lifes work
continue as the minivan disappears down the freeway heading back to los angeles
a freeway sign reads los angeles miles
thank you lord and again we ask for your forgiveness and guidance
adam watches his mini van move through the wash and rinse cycle staring paranoid at the mexican towel boy cleaning the interior
michael tries to open a child proof bottle of excedrin
boyd plays mrs
pac man in the corner
moore dry heaves for all hes worth
fisher finishes dialing waits
where are you
were on our way home
were running a little late
just like an hour or so
what about the chairs
i left a message
i think its going to be okay
you sound funny
did you do cocaine
ill see you in about four hours
as he hangs up the phone
distant unheard do you love me
fisher in a daze turns and walks into right into adam who has been standing there listening
adam doesnt look so good
i want you to hear me out
you and i have done nothing
we are innocent
i dont think so
we go to the police
we tell them the truth
before they find out
we save ourselves
the hispanic car wash worker beeps the horn adam jumps
the van is ready
adam stares daggers into fisher
we save ourselves
its our only chance
adam heads back to the car leaving fisher alone
the shiny clean minivan cruises to a stop in front of the house
little adam and timmy play in the fenced yard along with a couple of other kids
adam stops the car
the guys sit in silence as the kids assault the truck climbing all over it
little adam waves his crutches wildly
screaming daddys home
boyd addresses the fellas
the past is the past
today is the beginning of the rest of our lives
today is the best day of the rest of our lives
disgusted the first day
as lois with camera and liz come out the front door
disgusted depressed it goes today is the first day of the rest of our lives
however it goes the point is nobody says anything to anyone ever
as the little kids put their lips up to the windows making funny faces youre goddamn right
adam is silent watching the beautiful chaos that is his family
as the guys get out and are mauled by the hyper kids and lois and liz
with camera group shot
here we go boys
yes sir compare and contrast time
she starts herding the boys into a group pose
feeling a little hungover are we
do you kids take note
taking pictures see how pathetic daddy and his jackass friends look
fisher makes eye contact with liz
whats the word on the chairs
im working on it
then youd better work on it in the car
we gotta go see the judge
we dont say love honor and obey anymore
and we dont say till death do us part
today we say respect honor and cherish as long as you both do love
how does that sound
i kind of like till death do us part
i mean this is forever
in sickness and in health through good times and bad
honey what do you think
liz looks at fisher who is a nuclear wreck barely coherent
i dont know youve got all the important stuff in there
all right then
its refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment
will you have friends or family saying words singing or anything
beat are we supposed to
its not a question of supposed to its an entirely personal decision
some do some dont
we dont think so
i mean we just want the singing when i come out
what will that be
were just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar
you send me
oh i know that
how does it go
you know talks it darling you
you send me
you mend me
to fisher honey sing it for judge tower
in lieu of an anxiety attack fisher
ing you ewe ewe ewe send me darli
ing you ewe ewe ewe mend me
at first i thought it was infatuation
but oh its lasted so long
now i find myself wanting to marry you marry you and take you home
judge tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and its pretty pathetic
the guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes
lois takes pictures of the five groomsmen
liz closely watches as the tailor makes adjustments to fishers tux
adam looks sick
fisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs
a father and son moment
i wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you
you know just to be with you father and son before you run off and do your own husband daddy thing
starts to choke up im just so goddamn proud of you

fisher realizes hes not breathing
fuck you boyd
any time fat boy
boyd hangs up the phone looks at his picture on the realty sign he just pounded into someones yard
behind the bizarre sincere smile we now see the eyes of a maniac
boyd picks up the sledge hammer and swings wildly destroying his sign splintering it into kindling
fisher and liz taste different samples of cake and compare different cake designs with a baker
surrounded by hundreds of different floral arrangements liz shows a zombied fisher the flowers shes picked for the wedding
a beautiful country style beach house in santa monica
liz fisher and the realtor maggie walk into the charming kitchen
fisher seems stresses by the price tag
i love it
i just love love love love it

liz throws her arms around fisher kisses him
five percent should be fine for now which is lets see twenty thousand dollars
of course ill be splitting my commission with your friend
beat he is a very sweet man
liz stares at fisher
his hand shakes as he writes the check
adam lois and the kids pull into the mini mart up to the gas pump
adam ghost white fumbles for a credit card as the kids go nuts in the back seat
singing do your balls hang low do they wobble to and fro can you tie em in a knot can you tie em in a bow
snapping knock it off
dont snap at them
theyre driving me nuts
a black sedan looking like an unmarked police car pulls up nose to nose with them at the pump
two men in dark suits in the front look like cops
adam cant help but notice
getting out its a disgusting song
adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling his tank as one of the suits gets out of the black sedan and does the same
adam and the suit make eye contact
how ya doing
nervous mumble what
what did you say
i said hows it going
i didnt hear you
well thats what i said
adam nods eyeing his gas pump willing it to pump faster
his heart starts to pound he looks away sees
an lapd police car pull into the station stops in front of the mini mart
two cops inside
on adam eye balling the cop car
he slowly turns to steal a glance at the suit
how do you like that mini van
adams tank is almost filled
he wants nothing more than to get out of there
lois rolls down the window
honey go in there and get some starbursts
theyre screaming for starbursts
theyre screaming like monsters and its giving me a headache

adam looks from the suit to the cop car
track with adam as he walks from the pumping across the parking lot past the cop car his heart pounding
adam quickly searches the candy section for starburst
he looks out the window
the suit has finished with the gas but hes not leaving
hes taking a close look at adams van
he seems to be checking the license plate
oh my god
adam is blocking the aisle
he doesnt notice a young uniformed cop trying to get past
adam turns panics stumbles back into the candy display and topples to the ground
adam lies flat on his back in a monster mess of candy
adam scrambles to his feet trying frantically to fix the major mess only making it worse
the iranian store clerk approaches pissed
just leave it
determined its okay
startled by his tone adam staggers back into a gatorade display slips and topples to the ground
on his back im sorry
they young cop gives adam a hand up
adam stare at the cop
tears in his eyes im sorry
adam scurries out of the mini mart the cop watches in confusion
as adam races back to his car the suit moves in on him
the wifes begging me for one
hows the mileage
adam jumps in the van quickly starts it up
wheres the candy
there is no candy
what do you mean
its its a goddamn mini mart
adam in a cold sweat hauls out of the gas station pulls into traffic nearly gets hit slams on the brakes lois rockets face forward into the dashboard
fisher and liz greet their guests
moore smokes alone at the bar
boyd and michael charm a group of old ladies
adam arrives with his family adam jr
lois sporting a nose cast and two very black eyes
boyd and adam check each other out hostile and suspicious
adam takes fisher aside
have you thought about what i said
jesus adam can we not get into this now please
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack
cuts him off i got you
dazed wheres the bathroom
a large dining room in a westside restaurant has been taken over by the wedding party
seventy five guests dressed up are into the desserts
the toasts are about halfway over
fisher stands in the middle of the room with the large blown up pictures of keith at different stages of his life
holding picture of keith age on a mule and this is keith at age four and his best friend bunker the mule
evidently when they were in camp keith and boyd got into some serious arguments over exactly who was keiths best friend boyd or the mule
fisher holds up a photo of a young fisher and young boyd both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight
boyd sits with moore at a table
fisher had a less than normal relationship with that donkey
seated next to liz you always were a jealous man
fisher holds up a picture of keith boyd moore and michael all in a peewee football uniforms
after camp came football and for those of you not following the sports pages back in you might not remember the peewee powerhouse oklahoma who under the brilliant leadership of
yours truly rolled to an auspicious league record of scoring exactly zero touchdowns
tight on adam looking extremely uncomfortable surrounded by his family
the problem was coaching
as the room laughs adam becomes visibly upset
not keeping it together
the problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left
no the problem as i recall was the lack of blocking
as the guys debate in front of the room whos fault oklahomas season really was
tight on adam
hes had enough excuses himself from the table
tight on fisher seeing adam he quietly excuses himself
adam stands by his car trying to compose himself
you all right
i cant fucking breathe
boyd followed by michael exits the restaurant

adam attacks michael slashing biting mauling the brothers go down hard slugging it out on the ground
liz is back at the restaurant door
fisher bolts over to liz
just some more preparations

well all be right in
fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the
fisher helps break the fight
adam and michael try to contain their rage
this is going to stop right now
seething you will not screw this up

boyd pulls michael to his car

boyd opens michaels car door puts him in

michael starts his car
boyd shuts the car door

michael eyeballs adam
adam eyeballs him right back
michael hits the gas and screeches away
lets all go back in
youre cool right

i am not cool at all
reluctantly they start back in
a hundred or so feet away michaels car comes to an abrupt stop
they all turn
michael turns his car around idles for a moment
michael in a trance staring at the guys watching him
he hits the gas
wheels spin rubber burns
the guys watch as michael speeds full throttle like a battering ram right at adams beloved minivan
adam jumps between the minivan and michaels car
michaels expression turns to horror
he slams on the brakes but its too late
michaels car crushes adam like a sandwich meat between his car and the minivan
metal flesh severed limbs adam explodes like a gnat
the room is filled with people from the rehearsal dinner
black eyed nose broken lois sobs surrounded by her kids and liz
boyd and fisher talk to the police
it was just a crazy freak accident
he thought the car was in reverse
he didnt realize
the cop takes notes
michael sits in a corner by himself
was there some sort of an argument
nothing like that
we heard there was some arguing going on
some loud talk
we were just all outside just talking
what were you talking about
we were talking bout how it was going to be one of the last times for us to all be together with fisher not being married
a lot of people seem to think there was some hostility out there
getting righteous well i cant really comment on what a lot of people thought
i can only tell you that we had a horrible accident here and were all feeling extremely traumatized and your questions are a bit poorly timed
were in full on grieving mode right now thank you very much officer
no easy boyd
i got a best friend in there in pieces
how about a little sensitivity
boyd storms off goes and sits with michael
fisher stays with the cop
thats all i wanted to know
a doctor appears in the doorway
his situation is critical
hes asking to speak to his wife
shots of the guys eyeing each other nervously as lois slowly gets up and follows the doctor into a treatment room
the guys move to the door where they can see lois leaning over the hospital bed talking to adam
adam hooked up to dozens of wires etc
lois leans over to kiss him
adam appears to be whispering something to her
watching adam speak to lois
lois has her ear to adams mouth
he is clearly speaking to her
lois is sobbing when
alarms go off in adams room
a medical team rushes into the room
adam is a v tach hearts not beating
the team injects medicine defribulates
lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her
finally a doctor calls time of death
lois collapses on the floor
the guys have witnessed adams death
michael turns in horror
boyd fisher and moore stare
liz rushes to fisher throws her arms around him overcome with grief
fisher boyd moore and michael eat eggs
the need to know is clear
what did adam tell lois
thats the name of the game
what did adam tell lois
what does lois know
ball park sausages
you want some breakfast meat michael
is that what you want
clearly starting to crack franco harris has a flare for the dramatic
the former pittsburgh steeler running back beat known for the immaculate reception his improbable sixty yard ricochet reception
i say ricochet reception has made a bold move on corporate america
inappropriately loud harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the park sausage company
by taking on the challenge of resurrecting parks harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime
on a roll he must take an open field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share
before the clock runs out
customers are starting to pay notice
shut up michael
screams all eyes on michael
boyd is immediately up trying to get michael out of the booth
time to fly
fisher helps boyd lift michael who is becoming more and more frenzied
i ran down my brother in cold blood
shame on me
waitresses cooks and late night dinners stare confused as the howling michael is carried to the door
struggling time to pay the man
for if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
fisher and boyd struggle with michael
tipping waitress thank you
she watches them haul michael outside
michael thrashes wildly in the parking lot
kill one man and you are a murderer
kill millions and you are a conqueror kill all and you are a god
michael breaks free starts running away
boyd moore and fisher give chase
moore dives on michaels back
fisher helps moore hold michael down while boyd gets the car
calming down the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot
boyd is there with the car
they load michael into the back seat climb in and disappear into the night
boyd drives fisher rides shotgun moores in the back trying to contain michael
you will get yourself together here mister
are you hearing me
michael now catatonic stares out the window
hes cracked up
he is not cracking up
what have we done
what did you ask me

love is second to nothing
i love you
i love moore
i love michael
this car is full of love and nothing absolutely nothing supersedes love man

boyd takes fishers head in his hands and kisses him deeply on the mouth
love does not lose
tight on fisher speechless
a jewish ceremony
a hundred or so guests
a rabbi conducts the service
lois sits in shock flanked by her boys
michael fisher boyd and moore stand in positions of honor up front
theyre all eyeing each other
michael starts emitting deep uncontrollable highly inappropriate moans
michael cant control himself as his body starts to seize and tremble
moore and boys attempt to stabilize michael who breaks away charges over to lois and buries his head in her lap sobbing deeply
everyone is stunned but the rabbi continues
liz and fisher

ive got relatives on the airport right now
the phone rings
fisher picks up the phone
lois on the phone near hysteria
i just found a note up in adams study
its some kind of crazy confession about killing a stripper and cutting up bodies and
explaining burying them outside of vegas about boyd being the ring leader
she wants to know what the hell is going on and im starting to freak out here
boyd moore and michael looking particularly traumatized are seated at a booth with fisher
were not goosed
what is her disposition
does she sound pissed scared hostile
did she mention the police
no but shes definitely pissed and hostile
and shes clearly starting to think thats somethings not right
michael starts sobbing uncontrollably
goosed by god
michael get a grip
to fisher what did you tell her
i told her that i have no idea what adam was talking about in that letter
did she believe you
i have no idea

well i dont have that skill and if i had to guess i would say that in no way did she believe me
people are staring
to moore give me the valium
he just had two

moore counts out two valium hands them to boyd as michael continues to freak
to michael open sesame
michael complies like a puppy

michael starts back in with the power sobbing
all eyes are on him
guilty uncomfortable silence
michaels coming unglued
do you have something to tell me

shut up boyd
all eyes on michael
fisher struggles to breathe
boyd tenses up
lois we were bad we were very very bad
hes upset about adam

i will call the police right now if i dont start getting some answers
she heads for the phone
fuck you boyd
the guys are freaking as she picks up the phone
boyd looks at the kitchen knives
fisher sees him intervenes quickly
heres the deal
beat adam was with a prostitute in las vegas
lois freezes puts down the phone
boyd and moore look stunned at fisher good lie
im sorry he was unfaithful to you
and it wasnt the first time
he had a thing about prostitutes
fisher gives boyd a look
lois starts to choke up
crushed my adam
lois crumbles before their eyes
lois starts sobbing
michael joins in
and timmy appear in the door in their pajamas awakened by the noise
seeing their mother in tears they start to sob
the room is filled with anguished tears
boyd give lois a glass of water and a valium
fisher and moore load michael into the car
boyd leans into the back window
and timmy are in the backseat still in their p
mommy just needs a little time out

fisher starts to get in the car boyd pulls him aside very wound up

fisher kisses liz and goes
dark smoky music
michael fisher and moore sit in a corner booth
finger in his ear do you hear buzzing fish
i got some kind of buzzing
like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull
i dont hear it
yeah well its a nasty problem
have another drink
tracking shot down hallway into bedroom where lois sleeps peacefully
fisher and michael
moore drinking just listening
dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and adam
out back wed light em up
the three of us
wed hold em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light
and dad would be all
watch for it
here it comes here comes the wahoo the wahoo
the sparkler would burn hot then hotter then even hotter
and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect
it would only last a second but that second was it
it was it
thats what dad had us looking for
you get me
the wahoo moment
thats my point
you see man
burning at his absolute
to see all the forces just come together just right you know just in perfect harmony

and what if i already had it
what if its gone
and i never saw it
finishes drink youre getting married man
thats a fucking beautiful thing

i just cant stop breaking beautiful things
as lois sleeps boyd softly enters the room
moving in on the sleeping lois another couple of steps he looms over her reaches his hand to her throat when suddenly lois eyes snap open
boyd is startled
lois grabs mace from her night stand and sprays boyd in the face
he moans stumbles back
lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a side of beef
they go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild animals
you picked the wrong woman mother fucker
as lois sinks her teeth into boyds balls
you see for me its over
im gonna turn myself in
after the wedding of course
after the wedding
out of respect
i dont think thats a good idea
i said out of respect
respect for you fisher
for you and your wedding and your beautiful bride

this is my doing
you see im gonna have my wahoo spark for my own
for lois and the kids for my brother for franco
im gonna turn myself in
i am all that
im gonna do it for sweet lois
boyd and lois are choking the living shit out of each other
boyd pulls back swings with a left lois ducks she swings a right cross to boyds eye
he goes down
she jumps on him
choking him like a mad dog
as boyd struggles for air
fisher checks his watch as michael fumbles with his eighth shot of yukon jack
if i was to think

no i mean i have thinked it over
and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just
well i just

michaels eyes bore into fisher like he knows something fisher doesnt
fishers cell phone rings
tight on boyd eye swelling scratch marks hair a crazy mess
into the phone okay
heres the deal and its a good one
lois is cool
its a pacified situation
what does that mean
michael stares at fisher
im talking about lois having relaxed her anxiety
only deal is
you still got michael there
lois just wants to hear it from michael
that it was all an accident
she wants to here it from michaels mouth
michael drunkenly nods his head as if can hear the conversation
isnt it a little late
hold on a sec
turns lois you sure you wouldnt rather do this in the morning
pan over to see lois half hanging off the bed strangled to death
back into phone she says nows the time
quietly i got a peace treaty thing happening over here

fishers car pulls up
boyd is waiting outside
he opens the back door
michael is drunk in the back
fisher and moore are up front

hes too drunk
okay mikey lets go
to fisher and moore you guys stay here
boyd leads michael into the house
fisher and moore wait in silence
beat im thinking about maybe making a move
maybe go up to the north pole the arctic
tag polar bears with dart guns
ive always had a pretty good aim
a pop resounds from within the house
moore and fisher lock eyes frozen
boyd comes jogging out the front door hops in the back seat
fisher and moore turn eyes wide
michael was having an affair with lois
thats what michael and adam were arguing about in the parking lot
michael killed adam in a jealous rage
lois broke it off with michael he strangled her to death and then shot himself in the head
beat happens all the time
boyd touches the painful scratches on his face
that lois fought like a fucking comanche
on fisher and moore in stunned horror
tight on barry morris mid s attorney
i dont see how this could have been kept from you
the facts are quite simple last month adam and lois changed their will
they requested that you two as a married couple be the custodians of record for their estate including all properties cash holdings security holdings and
you are legal custodians of the brenn trust
liz and fisher flanked by adam jr
and timmy eyes wide they sit across from the attorney totally bazookad
they stare in horror at morris
adam and lois were not terribly prudent in terms of providing for the possibility of the unforeseen
what are you talking about
im talking about life insurance
im talking about money
adam had a five hundred thousand dollar term life insurance policy
what does that mean
that means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids
adam was switching to a whole life policy but re scheduled his medical exam
and failed to make his last payment
so his term life lapsed
so its value is null and void
off lizs horror now he did have a pension account worth another thousand
relieved well oh
and a house
valued at thousand
so wheres that leave us
we still get thousand
not even close
with property values down the house is worth less than he paid for it
with three credit cards the minivan payments and other outstanding debts
plus the income and estate taxes assessed on his punches his calculator youll get oh
in the neighborhood of ah
suddenly slips off his chair lands flat on his back starts struggling to get up
fisher tries to help little adam up
get away from me
im just trying to help
i dont want your help
fisher manages to get adam jr
back up in his chair
liz looks rather horrified
breaking the tension so
when is the wedding
tomorrow at fisher we are getting married tomorrow
fisher drives liz up front adam jr
and timmy in the back
everyone is shocked in silence
fisher looks deathly ill like hes about to vomit
he pulls the car over and gets out
fisher leans on the trunk puking
liz gets out to help him he starts crying
liz is gentle and loving
its okay baby
cry for mama
cry for mama
no its not okay
the kids watch from the rear view window but cant hear
cry for boom boom
sobbing liz weve got to cancel we have to put it off

ive waited twenty seven years twenty seven years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle
i will not be derailed
i will not be embarrassed
i will not be denied
i am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water
liz marches back to the car gets in and slams the door
fisher just stares in shock
its pouring rain outside
shots of guests dashing from their cars to the church
fishers parents with adam jr
and timmy looking overwhelmed
upstairs liz and her bridesmaids help liz get dressed
everyone looks depressed
fisher and moore in tuxedos
boyd enters shuts the door
fisher looks ill
okay were about two minutes out
moore better take your position
moore looks at fisher
a long tense beat between fisher and boyd
this is a situation that defies judgement
we have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most
im getting really tired of your bullshit
youve got a warped thought process
your brain doesnt function properly
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation
snaps im talking about some bad bad very bad things
those are bad fucking things
whatever you say kojak
im the serious one here
im the one making the play
im the indian runner
and i want my money
the organ is playing
the guests are seated
liz and her father are waiting in the front hall
i told boyd two fucking minutes
insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all
in no way have you mentioned that money
and i find that to be very very offensive
veins pulsing and if you think you can fuck me dont
cause im fucking insulated fisher
backed up on floppy
do you get me
i want my fucking money
not a prayer
im a lifesaver
up all night in the rain in stormy gale force wind tornado and fucking earthquakes
i stay lit for you
i stay lit
i dont go dark
i never go dark
you need help
fisher turns away
he leaps on fisher with a wild cry
i want that money
boyd and fisher fight like animals choking pounding mauling a fight to the death
fisher is losing boyd is choking the life out of him killing him
fisher is going down eyes rolling back hes dying until
boyds head is caved in from behind
reveal liz wielding a big heavy crucifix
boyd slumps to the ground
fisher gasps for air
liz beats him repeatedly with the crucifix until hes dead as a door knob
fisher is stunned
liz tosses the cross
miraculously only one perfect droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress
she flicks it off with her finger
composing herself here comes the bride
liz gathers up her train and marches out
fisher looks at boyd a bloody dead mess
fisher joins moore at the alter
judge tower smiles warmly at fisher
whispers downstairs in the closet
before moore can ask the organ begins playing the wedding march
liz starts down the aisle escorted by her father she smiles radiantly
lizs father kisses her and gives her to fisher
they stand before the judge who starts talking
tight on fisher
his head pounding
he hears none of what the judge says until
may we have the rings please
fisher looks at moore
moore opens the closet
boyd falls out
everyone waits patiently
fisher is sweating
he looks at liz who stares straight ahead
moore rolls boyd over checks every pocket trying not to get blood on himself
he hands the rings to the judge at which time he she fisher and liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff
the judge looks at moore
he pulls his jacket sleeve down
continues these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day
fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife to respect honor and cherish till death do you part
liz slides the ring on fishers finger
liz do you take fisher to be your beloved husband to respect honor and cherish him till death do you part
fisher slides the ring on lizs finger
i now pronounce you husband and wife
fisher kisses liz
they turn to face their guests who applaud
liz cries tears of joy
liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests
fisher and moore load boyds body in the trunk of fishers car
he came to me early today was talking about money insurance money
said he was gonna get what was his
he said he was the brain trust
said he was smarter than all of us
he started reading atlas shrugged staring at himself in the mirror
did he try to kiss you
all week long
fisher slams the trunk closed
only a few guests remain
fishers parents watch the boys
the caterers are cleaning up
fisher and liz sit alone
he kept saying he was protected
what does that mean
like if something happened to him he could still get us
i dont know
he could have told someone
he could have like in the event of his death somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried
the only proof is those bodies
so what do we do
move the bodies
move the bodies
fisher and liz look up at a sweet old couple who talk at the same time oblivious to each other
we just wanted to say congratulations and wish you great happiness
i just did
i said malzeltov
you never listen to me
were your uncle henrys parents
opal and earl
tell them from both of us
wish them luck
the secret to a good marriage is to listen
cheerleader smile thank you
the old couple shuffles away
fisher watches them go he suddenly breaks down crying
all i ever wanted was for you to be happy
i just wanted to give you the wedding the life you always dreamed of
sobs i just love you so much
beat unmoved you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them
in fact put moore in the ground too
if you dont tie up all the lose ends itll never be over
you put him down or dont bother coming back
do you love me
do you love me
fishers car blasts past a road sign reading las vegas miles
fisher drives moores in the passenger seat
theyre still in their tuxedos
fisher almost in a trance
im thinking about michaels franco harris fixation
you know how michael was always harping immaculate reception
ive seen that play
a lot of times
and i have to say this
franco was lucky
flat out right place right time
he was where the ball bounced
you get me
im saying its luck
you work your entire life all the training focus all the dedication all irrelevant
where does the ball bounce
my father spent his whole life trying to start a company practiced every day worked like a dog finally got enough money
hes paid the dues hes ready does all the market research picks his shot pup corn
thats right pup corn
little snacks for dogs
hes figured it out
there is a hole in the market and hes going to fill it
spends all out money works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up
after fifteen months the big day arrives the first box of pup corn pops off the belt
he comes running home with that box pulls us out of school
we all pile into the living room must be fifty of us and in comes shelmer our year old mutt
here shelmer my dad cries
hes got that little fucking pup corn in his hand here girl
this dog will eat anything she eats rocks anything
she walks up to my dads hand looks down at the little pellet licks it once turns around walks out of the room
shelmer rejected the pup corn
fifteen months of my dads life right there
not one dog ate pup corn
three months later pup corn shuts down
my father never got over it
silence hangs again
fisher and moore search for the graves of tina and ralph with flashlights and shovels
i think it was over here
they move into a new area and start poking around
it was over by those rocks
again they search prodding into earth with their shovels
fisher stops digging tired he pauses shines his light around until
fisher moves to a new spot
this rock is where i stood when i said the prayer
he starts digging in front of the rock
the earth is soft
moore and fisher quickly start to dig until finally moores shovel makes contact
and they dig some more
in the hole passing the suitcases up to fisher
loads the cases into the car
the suitcases are unloaded
fisher and moore dig a new grave
moores back is to fisher as he digs
ive been thinking about what you said that day
about using this whole mess to bring out the good in me
fisher is directly above moore holding the shovel looking down at the back of moores head
i think theres a lot of truth in that
im gonna pursue some options
i want to join that big brother thing
slowly raises the shovel over his head thats a good one
i want a black one
a little black brother
thats a big problem it seems to me
lack of racial integration
thats a big one
moore looks up to
fisher tears running down his face the shovel high above his head ready to bring it down hard onto moores skull
moore confused and then realization
cut between fisher above poised to strike moore below still and vulnerable
their eyes locked for several beats
what do you think
slowly fisher lowers his shovel
i think youd make an excellent big brother
back to work thats what im thinking
the cases are in the hole with boyds body
as fisher and moore re fill the grave with dirt we
fisher drives moore rides shotgun both mean are dirty sweaty and tired
well that ought to be about the end of that
tight on fisher staring deep into the road a faint smile creeps on to his face
the distorted but definitely recognizable image of franco harris running for his life
and its franco harris running for
franco makes it into the raider end zone
lost in his reverie wakes up in a hair pin turn
the speedometer reads
they run out of road
the car skids on the shoulder fisher cranks the wheel jumps the divider into oncoming headlights
fisher and moore lit up bright
fishers car smashes head on into another car
in slow motion fisher and moore are launched through the windshield in an implosion of glass and steel flesh and blood
we hear the sounds of scrubbing
tight on liz on her hands and knees scrubbing around the toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom soiled jockey shorts tonka trucks mess everywhere
we hear voices outside
liz gets up off her knees brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out the bathroom window
okay lets try it again
and timmy in ill fitted cub scout uniforms recite the scout laws
a scout is thrifty saves for the future
a scout is clean he keeps his body
a scout is brave
a scout can face danger even if hes afraid
lets see the salutes
timmy snaps out a fine salute
adam balances on one crutch to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face
he starts screaming
reveal fisher in a wheelchair both legs amputated above the knee
he leans over trying to help adam jr
up and his wheel chair tips over
fisher falls on top of adam jr
who screams even louder flailing arms and legs like a turtle on its back
reveal moore in an electric wheel chair he operated with a mouthpiece
as he is paralyzed from the neck down hes no help at all
timmy suddenly snaps
to adam jr
shut the fuck up
its okay its okay
liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner
timmy shut up
help your brother
let him help you
tight on liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished silent adam jr
gets back on his feet with the begrudging help of timmy
as fisher struggles to hoist himself up back in his wheelchair
remember a scout is helpful
a scout doesnt scream in the face of adversity
from the bathroom liz wails
fisher looks up at the window
to the boys okay lets skip to the scouts oath
on my honor i will do my best
the boys recite the scouts oath as lizs deep heaving wailing sobs grow in intensity o
to do my duty to god and my country
to obey the scout law to help other people at all times
slowly pull off fisher moore and the kids
to keep myself physically strong mentally awake and morally straight
crane up past liz at the window out of the yard over the house wider to reveal the surrounding track like homes housing track like families with track like nightmares
as lizs plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human village
