michael straczynski revised nd draft close on a horimono tattoo as it is being drawn into flesh
the ink is needled into the surface of the skin raw and bloody the needled brush tapped with the precision of ritual
the tattoo is in the style of a kuniyoshi print miyamoto musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon
the image has beauty but retains the violence required to saturate flesh with art
the skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle work
fucking shit fuck fucking fuck
pull back to reveal that were in
a place of designer furniture beautiful girls carrying towels tea and cigarettes
dozens of yakuza look on as the process continues sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos
hollywood the young yakuza member is getting his first tattoo a relatively small one on his back
he grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby
watch it old man
the old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush
maybe a little harder
what the fuck
youre doing it wrong
the needle is doing what the needle does
whats that supposed to mean
goldenrod revised nd draft
the irezumi does not hide the skin the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the book of five rings the warrior the
artist the merchant and the farmer
if there is a conflict between the needle and the skin between the mark and the man then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which
you are suited
what did you just say old man
hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old mans jaw
i know you didnt just disrespect me did you
you that fucking stupid
you disrespect me and ill tattoo this ceiling with your fucking brains
the old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through years of service to men like hollywood
i cant kill you til you finish this thing
gimme that mirror
hows it looking
goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus
hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror
he whistles approval as yakuza one enters carrying an origami envelope
for an old fuck
this just came for you
what is it
goldenrod revised nd draft
so open it dumb ass
he opens the origami envelope then hesitates at what he sees
what is it
he pours the contents out into his hand
looks like sand
he tastes it
the tattoo master drops his brush
it clatters to the floor
you know what this is
the artist barely nods
wanna let us in on the joke
years ago i watched a man open an envelope like that one
his eyes pool with fury at the memory
there were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now
then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood
you cannot bargain with what is coming
you cannot reason with it
because it is not a human being
it is a demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are dead
goldenrod revised nd draft
what came out of the shadows
i cannot say the word
he pulls open his robe revealing a hauntingly beautiful tattoo of a shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump of scar tissue at the center of his heart
that night one of their blades struck here
i should have died but for an accident of birth
my heart is here on the other side
hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon
what the fuck is that
looks like a ninja boss
are you kidding me
thats the word youre afraid to say
as he starts to laugh
ninja ninja ninja
his laughter is infectious
you old fuck
you had me going
thats some good shit
his lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his head disappears sliced off from his jaw up leaving his tongue wagging in space
lights shatter around the room
the panicked screams of the fleeing entourage co mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles of hollywoods foot soldiers as one by one they are eviscerated
goldenrod revised nd draft
theres a rush of movement more felt than seen
the whistle of swords through the air
cries and screams
guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled
stay on the face of the tattoo master barely visible in the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window
as the killing continues around him
then silence broken by the sound of heavy desperate breathing and a match being struck by hollywood who looks up and sees a dark figures standing before him
everyone else is dead
only he and the tattoo master remain
the figure regards him with still silence
for perhaps the first time in his life hollywood is terrified
you dont have to do this
whatever youre getting paid ill triple it
you hear me
ill pay you whatever you want
just name your price
their answer is silence
hollywood sees his guns nearby
with a desperate scream he throws the match in the air as he dives for his guns grabbing one in each hand
there is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed hands are tumbling gracefully through the air
the blade swings again slicing through his body as if it were barely there coming out the other side as hollywoods body erupts as it falls in two pieces splattering
the artist with blood
the match touches the floor and goes out
the tattoo master does not move has not moved
but you are real arent you
after a moment the ninja emerges into the moonlight the way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the dark to inspect its kill
the artist doesnt move but his eyes widen his heart pounding in his ears
for fifty seven years ive told your story
goldenrod revised nd draft
no one ever believed me
the ninja walks towards him his steps soundless
he crouches down his eyes taking in the old mans tattoo
but you are real arent you
theres the shing of a sword being unsheathed
the artist closes his eyes anticipating death
he waits for the death blow
it does not come
he finally forces himself to open his eyes
the ninja is gone having departed as silently as he came leaving death and blood in his wake
a roll of toilet paper drops into a cart
pull back to reveal raizo s slim and sinewy his expression distant almost haunted
he considers the toothpaste options for a moment then drops in one of those too
moves on to food
turkish muzak plays in the background a beatles song helter skelter by way of turkish musicians
other shoppers cruise past in their own private quests
raizo gets quick easy bachelor food six eggs a single stick of butter several handfuls of noodle packages
raizo waits while the checker a pretty young woman tallies up his groceries
thats a lot of noodles
beat are you a student
here on business
raizo shakes his head to all three
when was the last time someone cooked you a real meal
beat i get off at seven
goldenrod revised nd draft
you could come by let me make you a proper dinner
she winks at him
i dont think so
no emotion in raizos face
he pays in cash
he picks up the bag and starts away when so if youre not a student and youre not a tourist and youre not here to work
what are you doing
for the wheel to turn
and he exits
ancient gateway between asia and europe
minarets thrust up from the tangled streets into the bright aegean sky
the street is crowded with bicycles cars and motorcycles as raizo makes his way down a narrow sidewalk
wherever you are wherever you may go
were in a heavily shadowed room lit with flickering candles as an older man ozunu hard edged and unforgiving talks to his clan
you must never ever forget who you are how you came to be
you are ozunu
you are a part of me as i am a part of you
goldenrod revised nd draft
beside him is a ten year old boy
his expression has the weight of stone
this is the truth of your lives and it will remain true after death
he pushes the boy forward
this is my new son
i have given him the name raizo
welcome him as your brother
the clan mummers welcome raizo bowing their heads
one head remains upright looking him in the eye
a girl roughly his own age
her name is kiriko
mika coretti s high energy a force of nature in human form
she enters europol agent ryan maslows office carrying an armful of reports
whats all this for the delgata case
this is delgata sets her pile down and she hands him one folder from the ton
and the rest
her eyes tell him
you said youd take it serious when i had serious evidence
goldenrod revised nd draft a
does that evidence include photos of the loch ness monster as well
shes not laughing
youve trusted my research before whats the problem now ryan
whats the problem
come on mika its like one of those questions on an iq test which of these doesnt belong laptops space shuttles nanotechnology ninjas
all im asking for is an hour
give me an hour and if you still think im chasing ufos ill walk out and youll never hear another thing about them
he eyes her
why do i think im going to regret this
on a door lock as he inserts his key and hears oh mr
nan good youre back
raizo turns to his landlady an older woman who looks up at him from the top of the stairwell
we had a heating problem and i had to go into your apartment
raizo nods his expression not betraying the sudden tightness in his chest at this information
is everything all right
goldenrod revised nd draft b
yes fine its all fixed
you keep it very dark and spare in there
ali my privacy is very important to me
if you enter my apartment again without my permission i will leave your building
i just goldenrod revised nd draft
he closes the door behind him
he stands on the other side of the door surveying the room for a moment with severe unforgiving eyes
the place is monastic nothing decorative or comfortable
then in a quick series of cuts he checks all of the secret places he hides things
a drawer is flipped over and a hidden bottom opens revealing weapons
a panel in the oven reveals his chain and blade
a hidden compartment in his suitcase exposes inky folds of fabric
he sifts through them as we hear you should have died
raizo breathing hard stands over another young boy that he has just defeated in a fight
both are sweaty dirty scarred
the other children are lined up in perfect rows watching silently
most are boys but a few are girls
one of them is kiriko lithe and supple a childs eyes haunted by an adults sorrows and knowledge
ozunu circles raizo as he regards his fallen opponent
on the street
abandoned by your parents
without a home
without people to care for you
you should have done as most children do and gone quietly from this world to the next
beat but instead you fought
as you did here today
and you won
as we track with ozunu we see that raizos body is covered in scars
scars are the calligraphy of violence raizo
they inscribe the story of ones life
goldenrod revised nd draft
you survived because you are different
you are special
that is why you are here
that is why the great current which flows beneath all life carried you to me
mid day traffic tourists strolling down wide avenues past war monuments and street art
just long enough to establish under its a pattern like the currents of the ocean
close on a mound of bank records rivers of numbers cascading neatly down perforated spread sheets
some people see money as the root of all evil but to me it looks like a fingerprint
whether were talking about th century korea or st century iraq the game is the same
if you want to understand why certain things are happening you have to understand the flow of money
youre excited mika
you know i get nervous when youre excited
he would never admit it but he enjoys watching her work almost as much as he likes poking her about it
you remember the eulmi incident
goldenrod revised nd draft
korean queen late eighteen hundreds
according to you she was offd by one of these ninja clans
ive been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of kunitomo shigeaki
the prosecutor questioned him about a payment of pounds of gold
shigeaki answered that he didnt know what the prosecutor was talking about
the question was never brought up again
but what pinged for me was the amount the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the hattori clan for the assassination of lord sanda
so you start to wonder in this ever changing world if the cost of a mans life has remained constant
i figure these clans are like a thousand years old
they probably dont change a lot
she begins flipping through huge reams of bank records
i started looking at international wire transfers targeting banks in the regions of several high profile assassinations and bingo the proverbial needle in a haystack a single wire transfer circled
the day before the assassination
was transferred from the bank of shanghai
the exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold
goldenrod revised nd draft
i thought you might say that so i checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years
let me guess
he sifts through the report
okay you got me
this is interesting
the clans are real ryan
they steal children and turn them into assassins
theyve been doing it for years and nobodys doing a damn thing to stop them
look no ones denying the historical record mika
but the whole idea just doesnt fit in with a modern world
its like one of those questions on an iq test which of these doesnt belong in this sentence laptops space shuttles nanotechnology ninjas
theyre real ryan
you can call them spooks or assassins or whatever you want if it makes you feel better but theyre out there
theyre killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them

close on tokens being rammed down the mechanical throat of a washing machine
overhead the fluorescent lights strobe unevenly the fixtures old and in need of new bulbs
raizo steps back as the washer begins to cycle loudly a wheezbox instrument that rattles gurgles and groans
as he looks at the machine we hear our enemies are everywhere
ozunu strides among his children who are bathing scrubbing themselves with evergreens
you must move without trace or footprint
young raizo pours water through evergreens onto clothes he is scrubbing
you must become shadow your scent nothing but wind through trees
a pretty young japanese woman the only other customer calls to raizo as she stands beside one of the dryers
catches his eye would you mind
she hands him one end of a freshly dried sheet
if its not too much trouble could you help me with this
he smiles and nods
goldenrod revised nd draft a
they begin to fold corner to corner end to end
the fluorescent strobing above them
we sense a strange tension between them as we realize they are alone in the midnight cleaners
he looks at her
the uneven strobing on either side of the laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face
almost as though she had two faces
one light one shadow
we extend the silence for a long beat until he looks down at the sheet and says what clan are you from
she glances up sharply
you came alone
the ozunu clan would never make such a mistake
her eyes react as suddenly a blade flashes from beneath the sheet reaching for raizos throat
goldenrod revised nd draft
he catches the blade in the sheet twisting it in her grip
she fights for control
a fury of slashes and the sheet is shredded
the night manager is half asleep watching a korean soap on empress min
when he hears a series of crashes he gets up
he throws open the office door wielding a fire iron
what is going on the space is empty glowing with fluorescent glare
one machine is thumping loudly
he crosses to it
as he nears it bloody water begins bubbling up flowing over the top
ketchup splatters the chopped meat
and two cokes please
how long have you been here
and you cant say zwei cola bitte
course i can but you tend to hear more interesting things if people dont know you can understand what theyre saying
do you ever stop being a cop
not the way i was raised
my dad always said being a cop has nothing to do with a clock
its a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire
goldenrod revised nd draft
he smiles as they move to one of the circular tables
so you got something else
i think so
same template as before
the transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in osaka
the police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying
how do you know what the police report says
youre not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes are you
she shakes her head
quickly sipping her coke
what about the bank audit
it was a long shot at best
but you said you found something
a friend of mine in moscow tipped me to it
he slips an envelope from his briefcase and gives it to her
it was written during the height of the cold war by a high ranking kgb agent named aleksei sabatin
in it he raises the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the nine clans
goldenrod revised nd draft
mind you he doesnt call them ninjas
what happened to him
same thing thats going to happen to me if i keep hanging around with you booted out of the service for mental instability
is he still alive
we need to find him
working on it
you believe it now dont you
are you kidding
then why are you doing this
no idea he finishes his soda and takes his garbage to the can
but i can guarantee you that it has nothing to do with the fact that youre the most attractive researcher that ive ever worked with
he smiles and turns before she flushes a bright shade of red
a teapot begins to sing
raizo pours the boiling water into a plastic bowl of noodles
he covers the bowl and waits a moment for the soup to cook
as he stares we hear
goldenrod revised nd draft
the body must obey the will
several of the younger members of the clan are sitting at the table about to eat
ozunu stands before them
he removes a small blade from inside his robe
places the blade against his palm
hunger and thirst your bowels and breath even the blood in your veins are the bodys weaknesses
the knife slices down along his palm opening a split the flesh parts yet no blood flows
master them and you master the self
he closes his fist
this is the power of the ozunu clan
he concentrates squeezing his hand tightly until he opens it revealing that the wound has closed
this is the way of the ninja
the children look at each other except for raizo who stares at ozunu
eat tonight and you work twice as hard tomorrow
the children look at the soup their mouths watering
all around the older ozunu clan members eat noisily
one of the children cant resist any longer and begins scooping up the noodles
in short order others do the same
goldenrod revised nd draft
all except for raizo who sets down his chopsticks
willing himself not to be hungry
the grown raizo looks at his soup
we cannot tell if he is going to eat or not
the world feeds on the weak
young raizo stands in the central chamber of the compound
the floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern
they are not however glued down to the floor
the slightest wrong move will make them shift noisily
this is our first look at the nightingale floor
suffering exists only because weakness exists
ozunu watches from the far side of the room as raizo takes his first step
graceful as any dancer
he makes no sound
you must hate all weakness
hate it in others but most of hate it in yourself
he takes another step and another
each soft as a falling feather
he is a third of the way across the floor his body gleaming with sweat when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him
raizo stops a flash of panic in his eyes
then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot holds it out as ozunu rises and approaches
ozunu lays open raizos foot with a bamboo rod
slashing blows that leave deep cuts
goldenrod revised nd draft a
raizos expression hardly changes
ozunu returns to his place and raizo starts walking again making no noise and leaving no trace of his passage
except for a trail of small bloody footprints
the same evening
most of the children in this place sleep on mats in the same room
they are exhausted silent motionless
goldenrod revised nd draft
we find raizo and though he makes no sound his eyes show silent tears of pain his feet still bleeding and bruised
kiriko looks on from her mat for a long silent beat knowing the agony he is in
then as if coming to an inner decision she reaches under her mat for a leaf into which a thick salve has been folded
she crosses the few feet to raizos mat and as he watches in silent agony she puts her finger to her lips then kneels down and begins applying the salve
to his feet
within moments we can see the pain leaving his eyes
finishing quickly she folds the remaining salve back into the leaf exchanges a quick furtive glance with raizo then heads back for her mat
he lays there for a beat confused as to whether his diminishing pain is a good thing
then he turns to look at kiriko but she lays with her back to him apparently asleep
he regards her silently for a moment then rolls over himself to sleep as we come around to the other side of kiriko and see that she is very much
awake almost smiling
she closes her eyes
the apartment is dark as mika enters and turns on the lights
she looks the place over then goes room to room turning on every light in the place
the practiced way she does it makes it clear she does this every night
satisfied shes alone she goes into the bedroom to change
mika is curled up in a chair and with kgb report
she turns a page and sees a photocopied drawing of a very intricate floor that we now recognize as the nightingale floor
she reads the caption beneath it
goldenrod revised nd draft
russian accent historical evidence suggests that ibn battutas journey through the far east brought him into contact with what might be one of the oldest of the nine clans
he travels with a group of orphans that are being taken from a city devastated by war to the shido of the ozunu clan
the people of the surrounding province refer to the shido as the orphanage
we see battuta the th century muslim explorer sitting among the original leaders of the ozunu clan watching two children fight
battuta describes a ceremonial dinner followed by a display of martial skill
the combatants were children neither beyond the age of ten
battuta masks his revulsion as the battle continues until one child beats the other to death
small fists gleam with blood as one boy pummels the other
his host explains that a mans life must be made meaningless compared to the life of the clan
own the meaning of a mans life and you own his heart
slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes out
she freezes and the world seems to freeze with her
she doesnt move doesnt breathe
she forces herself to sit slowly up reaching under her bed for a cricket bat
a car drives by outside
could be nothing
could be everything
despite her fear she edges toward the door
slowly peers around it
the darkened hall is empty
goldenrod revised nd draft
there is a ticking sound like someone tapping at a window
could be a tree in the wind
could be something else
she moves slowly through her apartment
every shadow could conceal unseen eyes
she comes to the end of the hall where the overhead light is out
she flicks the switch on and off
she reaches carefully toward the light bulb
the bulb rattles its just burned out
she breathes a sigh of relief
then she notices that the living room window is open the blinds gently swaying from the wind tapping against the sash
she closes it and locks it
looks to her desk concerned
did she leave the window open
or is something going on
she goes to her desk anxious to check on something
she opens a drawer revealing a box of tampax
pulls out the tampax to reveal a key
a place no guy would think to check
she unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked dvd in a slim plastic case
relieved she starts to put it away
is it the same dvd
she moves os
the tv is switched on and an image begins to play revealing a time coded security camera recording an urban street corner in japan
the tape is riddled with digital noise and artifacting
then slowly the digital noise seems to coalesce to grow shapes
the shadows come to life
then with incredible speed two dark figures start battling it out their blades striking sparks that are still descending after theyve slipped back into the shadows
they emerge over and over brief flashes of clarity like the perfect arc of a calligraphers brush describing the wing of a bird
mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the screen examining the figures
one of the figures is wearing a mask but the face of the other combatant is revealed albeit somewhat obscured by the dim light and digital noise
goldenrod revised nd draft
as we push in we see that its raizo
but she doesnt know that name yet
who are you
she stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches the screen gently
istanbul raizos apartment day aa close on a bed of nails sixteen penny nails arranged in perfect rows pointing up the sharp tips catching the light
as we reveal raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep but this is really the first time we have heard him sound like he is straining
as we continue to widen we discover the reason for this he is doing handstand push ups
on the nails
over and over with little apparent effort
the hard edges and lines of his body catch the light like the tips of the nails as we hear strength is the only virtue that nature respects
ab flashback int
orphanage day ab children are sharpening their weapons
ozunu walks above them
hone your body
sharpen your mind
become the weapon you will need to survive
young raizo looks up and sees young kiriko looking at him
he looks back to his weapon
raizo walks down a street where repair work is being done
to keep cars from falling into the hole theyve covered the street with big steel plates
as the cars and trucks pass over the plates they make a bump thump sound
bump thump bump thump bump thump
we push in on raizo under that sound
goldenrod revised nd draft a
kiriko is working in the bonsai garden
raizo watches her silently for a moment noticing that she is secretly loosening the wires letting the branches ease back into their natural shape
you shouldnt do that
its against the rules
if they catch you then they catch me
theyll put you in the box
yes they will
she finishes releasing the branch
i believe the heart of the tree knows which way it needs to grow
trees dont have hearts
everything has a heart
goldenrod revised nd draft
theres sadness and bitterness in his eyes
hes closing off to the world becoming what they want
she wont let that happen
let me see
he hesitates then approaches
kneels down beside her
she reaches toward him
a sword he can handle but kindness has become something foreign
then allows her to undo the top button of his shirt
she presses her ear to his chest
then she gently whispers to it
hello you in there
she listens again
its saying hello back
and that its happy to meet me
but it misses you
raizo smiles despite himself
listen to mine im not lying
ill prove it
again he hesitates
then he leans in and listens to her heart
goldenrod revised nd draft
he looks up at her his ear still to her chest
and for the first time his face softens
in the present as the traffic bounces past raizo
his eyes saddening with memory he continues on his way
mika is at her computer doing what she does best intuitively sifting through interconnected threads of information
searching through what is known about ibu battuta she discovers information concerning the lost chapters of the rihla supposedly destroyed sometime in the th century
she remains immersed until a sound grows louder and louder
a vacuum cleaner
she checks the time
she looks up and finds two eyes watching her through the crack in her open door
startled she gets up while the eyes quickly disappear
in the hallway an older asian man is pushing the vacuum cleaner
he shuts it off turns to her
he seems not to understand her
the usual cleaner
well tell him i hope he feels better goldenrod revised nd draft
you should take care
work so late
not good for you
she smiles sheepishly
mika walks down the empty street the sound of her heels slap against the stone buildings
the shadows seem to stalk her
she hears a faint sound like metal claws against glass
she stops and listens trying to see into the dark
is someone there
raizo is practicing his chain form
we begin to hear the sounds of another fight
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo is fighting with takeshi a few years older in a room lit by hundreds of hanging torches
armed with katanas the boys duck dodge and weave around the burning obstacles as they fight
they are both extremely agile their bodies moving with the impossible flexibility of youth
kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan
if she feels anything as she watches the fight we cannot tell
they perform a vicious series of combinations then takeshis sword cracks against raizos head opening a huge gash
raizo hits the ground hard blood speckling the mats
takeshi backs away as ozunu steps in
as blood flows down the side of his face raizo looks like the young boy that he is
pain throbs from the wound and he begins to cry
did takeshis blow hurt you
you think this is pain
you are mistaken
he gouges three fingers into the boys stomach and twists something inside of him
his screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing
that is true pain
you must learn to live with it
he steps back leaving raizo writhing in agony
goldenrod revised nd draft
this is your first test
survive the night
he signals to the rest of the clan and they all begin to leave
kiriko is the last to turn away
raizo is still where we left him a twisted knot of pain his face stained with tears and crusted with snot
he is trying to control his breath at first without success
then slowly finally it begins to ease
his hand twisted into a kind of rigor mortis slowly begins to relax opening like a lotus flower
dawn breaks over the wall as ozunu returns to the dojo to find raizo is sitting in a full lotus completely calm the wound already beginning to heal
ozunu shows a hint of a smile
very good raizo
they are walking
maslow is nervous
goldenrod revised nd draft
last night im working late and i get a visit
guy named zabranski
works upstairs for internal affairs
just drops by
in the neighborhood cup a sugar how ya doin kinda thing
asks what im working on
oh this and that usual blibbity blab i tell him
then he smiles and says zabranski is leaning against the door jam
his faint smile reminds us of ozunu
i dont understand what is really going on but im smart enough to recognize a warning when i see one
if your little fantasy has even slightest chance of being real then these nine clans would have some pretty major juice protecting them
what are you going to do
we are going to tip toe very carefully from here on out
you dont do anything else without checking with me
did you find sabatin yet
goldenrod revised nd draft
maslow isnt sure he wants to answer her
they killed him
people die of heart attacks mika
was he married
did he have a family
god you are relentless arent you
i know you ryan you would have checked
still in russia
he pulls a folded piece of paper from his jacket
explain something to me first
where is this obsession coming from
what started this whole thing
goldenrod revised nd draft
we see mika reaching out to touch raizos face
like your father said
its a consequence of consciousness often interpreted as desire
desire for what
for the truth
he shakes his head handing her the paper
shes in berlin
mika shoots off as maslow calls mika
she takes several exaggerated tip toe steps
a shuriken blade grinds against a whetstone as raizo sharpens the weapon with practiced grace
despite being blindfolded
sunlight is held back by vertical blinds
when he finishes he stands a rodin sculpted out of midnight
we realize there are wooden blocks placed around the room
in his palm a single shuriken abruptly fans into many like a deck of cards
suddenly his arm whips around as the shurikens crack and split the thick wooden targets
he stands alone still blindfolded
goldenrod revised nd draft
these next five years will be the most important of your training
one of the older ninjas is wrapping raizos eyes with a sticky gauze like the tape used to wrap horses legs
for an entire year you shall live without one of your senses beginning with the sense you rely on the most your sight
takeshis sword slides from one position to another as ozunu looks on
raizo blindfolded reacts to the sound matching his posture a fraction of a second later
a true shinobi lives in darkness
the night is his weapon
takeshi attacks again
while raizo eludes or blocks several blows for every two he manages to block another connects
you must see with more than your eyes
raizo gets up slowly releasing the tension in his jaw
he takes his position again and this time the stance is easy his expression softer
this time as takeshi comes at him everything becomes clear
the whistle of the blade
the zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat
the sound of his robe
combined with takeshis unmistakable body odor raizo has everything he needs to dodge slip and counter
goldenrod revised nd draft
his chain strikes wrapping an ankle throwing a stunned takeshi to the wall
kiriko tries to hide her smile
ozunu nods in appreciation
raizo nods back as if he can see without eyes
young raizo still blindfolded is in bed
trying to sleep but its impossible
takeshis snoring doesnt help
he turns slightly towards kiriko as her chest rises and falls her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea water in a tidal pool
he begins to breathe in sync with her perhaps in hopes it will relax him
slowly all the other sounds in the room go away until only her breathing and his remains
there is the slight murmur of their hearts
then she opens her eyes
and smiles at him because he cannot see her
but he hears her heart begin to beat faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips
they listen to each others breathing growing heavier the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster
her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement
tilting her pelvis up rubbing her hips ever so slightly against the blanket its like tectonic plates shifting for raizo
bump thump bump thump bump thump their hearts growing louder and louder as they become mika knocks
the cold war widow opens the door
im with europol
we spoke on the phone
goldenrod revised nd draft
stepping aside ah sehr gut
sabatin and mika sit across from each other
the house has the chill of loneliness
tea has been set out between them
you said you read my husbands report yes
what did you think
i found it
especially the references to the rihla
your husband quotes passages not found in battutas present manuscript
my husband journeyed all over the world researching that report but when he was home he never spoke about it
he said it was safer that way
i understand the report caused some problems for him inside the the report caused problems for alexeis career the way moses caused problems for the pharaoh you see
terrible people saying terrible things
she pours tea the harsh memories still fresh
goldenrod revised nd draft
after he retired
was asked to retire
we moved first to byelorussia and then here to berlin when the wall came down
he said this will be a good place to grow old together
and it was for a time
she looks off shakes her head
about two years ago
yes after the assassination of zhukov the report drew attention
after that everything was different
as alexei supervises workmen install locks put in fencing material hang lights and video cameras on the outside of the house
alexei hired men to change all the locks and put in more of them
locks on the windows locks on the doors locks on the locks
he put in cameras and motion sensors and lights
the lights snap on illuminating the back of the house with brilliant klieg lights
there can be no shadows he said
closer on mrs
sabatin as she looks down at her tea
i will tell you a true thing and a hard thing
my husband was a soldier
a member of russian intelligence
he had seen many terrible things
beat he was not a man to frighten easily
goldenrod revised nd draft
but from that day on when the sun went down behind the hills
in his eyes i saw the fear a child has of the dark
beat then one day a man came to the door
we are over the shoulder of someone who could be raizo or takeshi as the door opens revealing alexei
after a moment alexi invites the man in
a security camera watches them enter the house
they talked in alexeis study for sometime
then the young man left
sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries toward the study door
it was unlike alexei not to see him out
i remember being very scared
but when i opened the door he was just sitting there
for a moment he didnt even notice me
then he stood up and kissed me and told me that he loved me very much
he said i should always remember that
we see alexei looking shell shocked eyes hollowed as he stands and kisses his wife
his eyes begin to shimmer with tears but before he cries he leaves
do you know what they talked about
alexei never spoke about it
but two months later he was dead
can i ask how he died
goldenrod revised nd draft
the lights have come on outside his house
alexei comes out a gun in hand shielding his eyes
searching for whatever set off the automatic lights
then suddenly darkness
and sudden movement in the shadows that lunges toward alexei
a as mrs
sabatin shakes her head looks away
a the lights went out
she looks to mika
that says it all
you are the first person who has taken my husbands work seriously
it would be good to know that he did not die without cause
come with me
mika follows her into an adjoining room where mrs
sabatin pulls the bottom drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor
from the darkness she removes a metal box
he would want you to have this
raizo sits alone
crossed legged on the floor
theres an ocean of sound swirling around him
the cacophony of instanbul evening rush hour
raizo starts to build a dam auricular sandbags laid one by one walling off the outside world
the traffic outside horns engines squealing tires rattling trucks chassis all fade away
people shouting singing
a couple next door making love
a baby wailing
slowly the world fades away until there is only one sound
faint familiar but almost too quiet to hear
goldenrod revised nd draft
he listens to it
meditates on its simple rhythm
until a sound explodes in the room it is a sound we havent heard in his apartment a phone
he rises slowly as the phone continues to ring
he answers it silently waiting for something the line clicks and goes dead
raizo walks through the crowded market
shoppers salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the stalls
five children who we see only from the back run past
the last one jostles against raizo as he goes by
raizo keeps walking but he is holding an envelope in his hand
he slips it into his pocket
raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street
theres a square of paper inside and a photograph
on the paper is a street address in berlin
the photograph is a close up of a womans face
close on the box
it sits on her desk calling as another box once called to pandora
she opens it
inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the style of s archeologists like those of the dead sea scrolls of the lost chapter of ibn battuta
the scrolls contain his th century islamic writing and several sketches
goldenrod revised nd draft
there is also a very rough map that suggests the location of the orphanage
images of the orphanage of the children training and their ordeals bloody combat ritual bindings beatings on the nightingale floor
there is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage tree of the nine clans
also in the box is a single vhs tape
she pushes the tape into the player
its a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the front of the sabatin house
a man walks up to the house and ringss the bell
we cannot see his face
sabatin opens the door
they exchange words
sabatin seems wary but invites the man in
mika doesnt understand why this is significant
she hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man exits
she stops rewinds and plays it again
as he steps out of the shadow of the house she sees his face it is raizo
she is startled when someone pounds on the door
it seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries to open it revealing maslow and hes not happy
you lied to me
he pushes into the room and slams the door behind him
whatre you i told you to stop using my confirmation code
i did dammit mika goldenrod revised nd draft
im sorry it was the only way i could get the evidence
everythings fucking happened
he tries to dial it down succeeds but only a little
when you were slapping my code all over town like some phone number in a bathroom did you happen to notice the classification code on the cases you were digging
what did it say
do not quietly actually that would be dnfp we see men and women in dark suits their expressions deadly serious tossing through everything he has in the place
right now there are people from internal affairs cia homeland security and for all i know the martian fucking military in my office tearing the place apart
goldenrod revised nd draft
i dont know what theyre looking for but i think you do
she shifts nervously no poker face
she turns and leads him into her home office
with the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer
maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of sabatins box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence
most of this is from sabatin
copies of what i think are the lost chapters of the rihle
i think it describes the original location of the ozunu clan but my th century arabic is a little rusty
meaning the dvd
thats how it started
i made a mistake mixed up the case code and they sent me that
a moment later the dvd is playing raizo and the other ninja dancing through the shadows
i dont understand why theyre fighting though
it could be a clan war
maslow starts to put it together
so you requisitioned this by accident
you used my code which is why you didnt want to show me this
which is also why theyre tearing apart my office right now
im sorry ryan
you have to know i didnt mean for you to get in trouble
goldenrod revised nd draft
i just thought if this was real if these clans were killing people you know it was our job to try to stop them
he eyes her
isnt that what your dad would do
okay thats low
look i know i broke the rules
ill explain what i did and accept the consequences
very noble of you but ive got the feeling this isnt a slap on the wrist kinda consequence
let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started
in the meantime you will not say anything to anybody
close on raizos fake passport
are you coming to berlin for business or pleasure mr
han raizo smiles pleasure
shes at her computer studying a topographical map of japan trying to relate the ibu battutas drawing to it
suddenly she realizes she is not alone zabranski is leaning against the door jam
goldenrod revised nd draft
boy youre like a dog with a bone on that computer arent you
who are you
he reaches across her desk
need to ask you a couple of questions
you are mika coretti yeah
she nods her gut clenching
he pulls out a small notebook
you work a lot with an agent
a few cases
you have something of a social relationship
you had lunch with him on the th and again on the th
how do you know that
is it not true
im not sure
we do have lunch together sometimes usually when were working are you working on something with him right now
goldenrod revised nd draft
not right now
has agent maslow seemed different lately in any way
has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual
has agent maslow done something
he smiles in the way a piranha might smile if it could
the agency cares about its field operatives
we monitor for signs of stress fatigue mental exhaustion
agent maslow has a serious case load
that much work can wear on a man
she gets up and closes her door
she grabs her phone and calls maslow
this is ryan maslow
leave a number she disconnects then texts
it is later
the garage is a gyre of shadows
mika walks towards her car
the fluorescent light flickers and goes out
she stands in the dark
youre kidding me
it flickers back on
she continues to her car
she gets in as a shadow leaps to life behind her
she starts to scream when she realizes its goldenrod revised nd draft
fucking christ ryan i couldnt talk earlier
theyre watching me
zabranski came to my office
asking about you
i know how sabatin must have felt
i showed jamison the materials
what did he say
a typical autocrat
this agency is subject to the international laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority
if a case is marked dnp we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and act accordingly
i understand that sir but let me be clear agent maslow
in the eyes of the law these materials do not exist
if so than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue
goldenrod revised nd draft
he took the materials
come on mika how could he take something that didnt exist
which means that i couldnt copy it either and if i couldnt copy it than i cant be violating international laws and agreements by still having it
she likes this guy
what are we going to do
your going to go home
pack your bags and go on holiday
no way dont fucking argue with me mika
i trusted you
now youve got to trust me
ryan i cant let you lose your job because of me im not talking about my job mika
he hands her a glock and two spare clips
its clean no serial number
ive never even fired one of these
pointing this is the bad end
this is the end you hold
point shoot run like hell
he also gives her a phone
goldenrod revised nd draft
im going to try to find some help
until then i need you gone
dont tell anyone where youre going just go
use this phone to text me when you get there or if you have any problems
ive investigated world bank officials drug cartels arms dealers and ive never faced this kind of heat
he shakes his head and slips out the door
mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building gets out and starts down the street when she sees the apartment building and the one next door are
candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows a scattering of neighbors congregating outside
mika approaches a neighbor
us the building behind us that one across the street
seems like every few months boom the lights out
i call i complain they listen
nothing gets done
so i sit out here at least its cool
mika looks up at the building scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything
she pulls a tiny led flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building
goldenrod revised nd draft
watch your step
youre not the first person to give me that advice today
and she continues into where she climbs the steps each creak adding to the possibility of attracting trouble
on the passing floors we hear doors being opened and shut footsteps the distant murmur of voices
could be nothing
could be everything
she presses on
she opens the door to her apartment shining the tiny light ahead of her
shadows chase each other across the room as she swings the light one way then another
there seems to be no one else in the place
but as she hurries into her home office we see a shadow move behind her
as she packs she begins to hear something a tapping
the same sound she heard before
she pulls the gun from her purse
with the flashlight spearing the darkness she goes to her office
again the window is open the blinds gently blowing against the sash
she is certain the window had been locked
now every shadow is alive
she rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction
her flashlight finds her suitcase
on the top of her clothes she sees it an envelope
setting the gun down she picks up the oragami folded envelope
opens it with a shaking finger
black sand spills out
terror steals her breath
behind her a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja
before she can even move a blade flashes from the darkness heading for her neck goldenrod revised nd draft
another shadow blocks the blade knocking mika over the bed
the sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness
her flashlight catches glimpses
impossibly fast lethal predators trying to kill each other
she crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase towards the gun
another blow arcs for her and is again blocked
her hand finds the handle of the gun
she points into the dark fires
the gun flash strobes the room freezing the two ninjas in the blink of a flashbulb
they move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying
she can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight a blade is struck deep blood erupts
one shadow falls to the ground
the other turns towards her
her flashlight shakes as the ninja reaches up and removes his mask
it is raizo
he sees in her eyes that she knows him
you know me
security camera in new york
recorded you fighting
one of them
she glances at the dead ninja
you know about them
goldenrod revised nd draft a
uhh well there are these clans
were not sure how many
and they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years
give or take
he nods faintly
then turns to his dead brother
his name was jin
you knew him
he was not born an assassin
she looks at the dead body
youre from his clan
his nod is almost imperceptible
why did you stop him
the clans have three kinds of people
people with power
people with money
or people hunting them
goldenrod revised nd draft
he hears something she cant
she starts to speak and he stops her with a gesture
the hanta kirra
does that mean what i think it means
they wont stop until you are dead
she looks for her gun
the gun wont help you
i dont have a lot of options okay
i once took a tae bo class but thats the extent of my kung fu abilities
i can help but you must tell me something first
you saw ms
how did you know that
ive been watching you waiting for them
she tries to compute the idea that hes been following her
goldenrod revised nd draft
did she give you something
she nods raizos eyes lite up
you have them
shakes her head no
but i can get them
he hears something else
we need something black
she runs with the flashlight to a bureau
inside is a black tablecloth
he pulls her shoes off
step where i step
he leads her down through the stairwell of the large walk up
she follows him step by step
suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway
wrapping the tablecloth around them they melt into darkness
beneath the wrap he puts his hand over her mouth and nose stopping her breath
outside after a long beat a ninjas foot silently glides past climbing the stairs
inside he releases her nose
before she can finish taking a breath he yanks her up and they quickly descend the remaining stairs
the dead ninja lies in a pool of blood
goldenrod revised nd draft
the shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge born from the black the hanta kirra
their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment his dark eyes flashing that we recognize
like snap focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the fight the bullets in the wall footprints and shattered lights
one of the killers uses his sword to trace the line of a slashing cut in wall
braille from the blow that raizo used to cut the ninja
he removes his mask and we see its takeshi
another ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his nose
like a dog getting the scent his inhalation a long low whisper in the silent room
hes taken the girl
takeshi nods turning to the windows
he smiles a hunter who knows the hunt is almost over
weakness compels strength
a figure is running wildly through the thrashing branches
ozunu addresses the clan his eyes like those of an executioner
betrayal begets blood
goldenrod revised nd draft
we are gaining on the figure who continues to bolt like a panicked horse
this is the law of the nine clans
this is the way of the ninja
we rush up behind the figure who glances back
it is kiriko and she screams as we attack the sound of the assault becomes mikas car rushing past us
raizo is silent
mika is driving
im going to have to make a phone call in order to get the manuscript
does not matter
just get as far away from here as fast as you can without drawing attention
you think theyre following us
i know theyre following us
goldenrod revised nd draft
she watches in the mirror for a moment
i dont see anything back there
they have our scent
following our scent
how do you know so much about them
i was one of them
you flunked out of ninja school or something
raizo is dressed in normal clothes his hair starting to grow back from the close shave he had in the orphanage
he wears a silk blindfold
ozunu sits in the leather gloom of the stuffed upholstery
you may remove the blindfold
raizo does so
looking around at the lights of osaka a city he has never seen before
your entire life has brought you to this moment
do not fail yourself
do not fail your family
raizo nods faintly
goldenrod revised nd draft
he is wearing a black and gold watch
bring it to me
raizo nods again then opens the door and steps out
close on the fat wrist of a large man as he strides across the lobby
he turns to his entourage which includes several bodyguards and a few arm pieces
want me to come with you boss
so you can shake it for me
you some kind of secret faggot
he laughs and the arm pieces cluck on cue
he heads into the bathroom
kingpin enters there is only one person in the bathroom raizo washing his hands
his eyes flash in the mirror watching the kingpin only after he has turned away
the enormous man steps into a stall
after a moment he begins to piss moaning slightly as he does
raizo hits the air dryer button
the sound fills the room
a thin razor sharp blade flashes from his sleeve
the kingpin continues to enjoy his piss but as we look at him we see the door behind him silently swing open revealing raizo
raizo stares at the back of the mans head
he can almost see his jugular beating beneath the thick folds of his neck but something prevents him from striking
goldenrod revised nd draft
the dryer stops the sound of the piss dribbling when the kingpin suddenly looks back over his shoulder the fuck
raizo strikes but the kingpin is able to deflect the blow which sinks into his enormous body
that kinda tickled
he smashes a fist into raizo that slams him backwards
gonna take more than a knitting needle to fuck me up boy
raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is not going to be easy
several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck of a smaller man only seem to make the kingpin madder
soon both are covered in blood and gore
but it is not until raizo slams the mans head against the lip of the urinal the first time a font blood splashing up the second time the porcelain shatters
as the kingpins head opens spilling black blood across the floor
it is raining
raizo still wearing his bloody clothes climbs up onto the roof his clothes spattered with gore
he waits as the shadows around him come to life ozunu takeshi and several other clan members surround him
all but ozunu wear their masks
raizo extends his hand revealing the black and gold watch smeared with fresh blood
he offers it to mr
goldenrod revised nd draft
it will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that i have given you
you have made me proud tonight raizo
there are some who believed you would fail but i knew you would not
his eyes narrow
you have a strength inside you raizo
you must use that strength now to show me that you are truly ozunu
several of the other ninjas step back
he pushes a small hooded figure forward
weakness compels strength
betrayal begets blood
takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl
she is bloody bound and gagged and for a flash raizo sees her as kiriko
a daughter that turned her back on her family
she tried to run
takeshi hunted her down
he unsheathes his blade offering the hilt to raizo
it is the law of the nine clans
raizo looks at the girl her tears lost in the rain
we cannot tell if raizo is crying as he takes the blade he cries out the light of madness in his eyes
he strikes lashing out with the fury of a wild animal at ozunu who bends back with impossible grace
but not far enough
goldenrod revised nd draft
the point of raizos sword slashes across his face opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and mouth
he hasnt tasted his own blood in years and the anger boils up in his eyes
raizo meets their attack
throwing himself into the fray as only a man who is no longer interested in living can
but the ninjas are everywhere
they hurl shuriken at him by the handful a storm of jagged steel racing for raizos flesh
raizo blocks some of the shuriken misses many more
the shuriken strike muscles tendons flesh
he swings around still trying to attack there are too many of them
he stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as takeshi swings what he believes will be the death blow as raizo half falls half leaps backward falling from the
rooftop tumbling through space until he splashes into the canal below bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood
mika speeds along the autobahn
okay if youre not going to say anything do you mind if i talk
when i get nervous it helps if i talk
he says nothing
my name is mika by the way
goldenrod revised nd draft
yeah well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise
he considers her
is the name i was given
so you were an orphan
his head nods slightly
interesting nature verses nurture case study i imagine
he cocks an eyebrow
if its okay with you ill try to fill in some of the blanks
you must have been taken by the ozunu clan trained to be an assassin but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program
i dont imagine this went over so well and since theyre after me for just peeking through the keyhole they must be after you in a major way
but you are also after them or you wouldnt have bothered going to sabatin
which i figure means youre searching for the location of the orphanage because thats obviously the only information battatus book would have that you wouldnt already know
he looks at her impressed
yeah i got some moves too
im pretty lethal with the research thing
he almost smiles
goldenrod revised nd draft
but heres a question i cant answer since you didnt know i went to sabatins why did you save me
ninja only kill two kinds of people
the first kind has power and money
the other kind is trying to stop them
he nods noticing shops out beyond the exit
the shops are all closed mikas car crawls to a stop in the empty parking lot
raizo looks her over
i understand retail therapy as well as any girl but i think its a little late
you are a size
cept certain times of the month
he starts to leave then stops if you leave while i am gone they will catch you and kill you
he looks her in the eye
do you understand that
he opens his door and slips out
goldenrod revised nd draft
she watches as he heads for the doors
he passes into the shadow of the building and disappears
she digs into her bag for the phone maslow gave her
but situ stable
guardian angel all in black
need battuta book soon
m she hits send
looks out to the darkness surrounding her
after a moment one of the shadows comes to life
the door opens and raizo gets in his arm full of clothes
we need a hotel
the car is parked around several others
raizo goes into the bathroom and turns on the shower
do not use the hotel soap
or any towel
do you smoke
put your clothes in here
he pulls the garbage bag from the wastepaper basket
then leaves as she begins getting undressed
outside the hotel raizo finds a pine tree
he cuts several branches from it
back in the room he enters the bathroom
she is still in the shower
goldenrod revised nd draft
dont you know how to knock
im trying to save your life
he hands her the tree branch
dry yourself with this
he starts taking off his clothes
he does it quickly without any sense of awkwardness the world where he came from makes little distinction between male and female
shes not from the same world keeping herself as covered as possible with a tree branch
he jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself off
im just a researcher
im really not equipped to deal with this
he steps out and quickly wipes the dripping water off his body with the branch
in the bedroom raizo is dressed in new clothes
he lights a cigarette as mika come out struggling with the tightness of her new jeans
these are a little tight
run a little small i guess
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo takes the cigarette and begins waving it all around her
this is for my scent
close as he picks the lock of a different car trunk
they teach you that at ninja school
most locks are not worth the metal theyre made of
the trunk pops open
raizo tosses their bag of clothes under the lid of the tire compartment
then closes the door
he leads her down the parking lot sizing up the cars until he finds one he likes
youre going to steal a car
just borrow it
the door opens
in for a penny in for a pounding
raizo takes out a small electrical device
he aims it at the dash and hits a button
the device finds the right frequency to start the car
she is impressed
goldenrod revised nd draft a
at ninja school i minored in electrical engineering
his smile makes her smile
a moment later the car flies back towards berlin
now we have some time
goldenrod revised nd draft
how much time
make your call
she nods digs through her purse for the phone
ryan its me
for christ sake ive been calling for hours
im in a bit of trouble trouble
you miss jury duty youre in trouble
youre in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit
least im not down here by myself
she looks at raizo
your guardian angel
is it him
the one from the tape
hes on our side ryan
i trust him
i promised him the battuta pages
do you still have them
goldenrod revised nd draft
yeah i got them
can you meet us
in three hours
how bout the usual
maslow waits the red tip of his cigarette glowing in the middle of his silhouette
mika is leading
there he is
raizo hesitates an animal sensing danger
hes a good man
its all right
they approach maslow
he embraces her
youre all right
thanks to him
why have you done this
step back mika
people will die
goldenrod revised nd draft
maslow takes hold of mika as he shouts an explosion of light a firing line of kliegs all aimed at raizo each as bright as a slice of the sun
twenty heavily armed men emerge from the wall of light
hands on your head
on your knees
do it now
this is wrong
the clans have people everywhere
raizo raises his hands slowly a glance thrown like a shuriken at maslow
what are you doing
the men swarm over him binding him with brutal efficiency hauling him away
a faint look of disgust dangling from his lips
kiriko is panting covered in sweat and blood standing over a bloody beaten takeshi
all failure must be sown into the flesh
kiriko is handed a razor sharp blade
goldenrod revised nd draft a
takeshi prepares for the blow but kiriko drops the blade
he marches up to her
you know the law
her silence remains defiant while he boils with suppressed rage picking up the blade
you will wear this disgrace for the rest of your life
he slashes her slicing across her face
raizo wakes up
theres a commotion on the other side of the shoji screens that comprise the inner wall of the dorm
silhouettes limned against the paper
raizo moves to the screens
pulls them a half inch aside as the other children watch
through the tiny gap he sees ninjas dragging kiriko down the hall
gagged arms twisted with shiburi blood streaking her pale and terrified face
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo is chained to the walls of a vault
spread eagled double locked and lit from all sides so there are no shadows anywhere in the room
raizos head sags
cameras stare at him
classic berlin aesthetic
a modern office shoe horned into an abandoned building cubicles computers and aeron chairs amidst crumbling walls
maslows team are hanging out there thirty agents a fairly competent and well armed bunch
maslow is inside the control room which is like a small construction trailer
several different monitors have images of raizo
prisoner is secure sir
for a moment it appears that raizo looks up as maslow looks at him as if somehow raizo could see through the lens watching him
then his head drops again
he scans the different monitors
somethings wrong with the infrared cam
no sir we checked it
then why isnt he showing up
we think hes able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral
or maybe hes just cold blooded
goldenrod revised nd draft a
the goon struggles to stop mika as she storms inside
ryan you know this is wrong
it cant be legal
what is this place
your own private guantanamo
its an old gdr safehouse
jamison wants this off the grid
ryan youre making a huge mistake
i dont think so
we got reports from washington london osaka all tagging your boy
only problem we have is where to extradite him first
so two weeks ago theres no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one
we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies
hes not the enemy
you ever heard of stockholm syndrome im getting the feeling im looking at a pretty serious case of it
im not crazy
goldenrod revised nd draft
hes a killer mika
werent you the one telling me it was our job to stop him
youre not listening to me
youre not saying anything worth hearing
look if want to do the insubordination tango lets go but not in front of the kids okay
boys give us a minute
the security goons clear out closing the door behind them
she wheels on him to let him have it
damn it ryan i but he holds a finger to his lips indicating be quiet
listen to me we dont have much time
look i dont know what youve stumbled into but somebody is pulling some major strings inside
they want him dead
hes been fighting them for years
i believe you
softer i believe you
ive been in this business too long not to smell a set up
but we have to be careful how we handle this
and i cant risk you going awol on me again because beat because i dont want anything to happen to you
he glances up at her and its clear he has affection for her
goldenrod revised nd draft
he presses a tracking device into her hands
if trouble comes turn this on no matter where and ill find you
raizo remains motionless his eyes open when he hears someone coming
you shouldnt do that theyll catch you
then theyll catch me
theyll put you in the box
it is the middle of the night
raizo lies on a floor mat unable to sleep
he looks over at kirikos empty mat
quietly he gets up and makes his way outside
he moves to an upright bamboo box about the size of a coffin
looking at kiriko in the box
dehydration has left kiriko with barely the strength to breathe
her lips are swollen and cracked she sags against the tight walls of the box
he pulls a bamboo straw from his dark robe then fills his mouth with water from a flask
sticking the straw through the bamboo poles near her lips he feeds her drop by drop and in this way separated by a cage they share a kind of kiss
her eyes part ever so slightly and she manages a smile
i told you
i tried to warn you
goldenrod revised nd draft
yes you did
but you did it anyway
why am i in here for watering my tree
or why are you out there
she meets his eyes
mika is standing behind the bars which slide open
she has a bottle of water she looks at the two armed guards following her
could you give us a moment
not safe maam
if he wanted to hurt me he could have done that a while ago
maslow okayed the water
they stand near the door as mika crosses to raizo
you looked thirsty
she holds the water bottle to his lips whispering
i didnt know about this
he nods swallowing another sip
goldenrod revised nd draft
the only time you lied to me was when you told me your size
how did you know that
it is special
you know about my heart
hearts speak truer than tongues
he is unlike anyone she has ever met
listen maslow is on our side
hes going to try to help you
its too late
all that matters is the rihla
get the manuscript before they get here
the hanta kirra
mika rushes up to maslow who is talking to the group of europols
ryan can i talk to you
we have to do this again coretti
i have reason to believe that a group of ninja may be on their way here
the men chuckle
goldenrod revised nd draft
i think these gentlemen can handle a few whack jobs wearing pajamas
am i right
they ad lib responses fucking a sir
locked cocked and ready to rock
but the situation we discussed im working on that
you have to give me a little time
we dont have time
theyre not here now
theyll be here soon
how soon raizo looks up
his eyes narrow theyre here
the lights go out
mikas eyes dart into the pitch red emergency lights suddenly glowing ominously
raizo maslow spins as she sprints for the stairs
maslow draws his firearm and hisses at one of the special ops
goldenrod revised nd draft a
go with her
secure the prisoner
instantly tiny led flashlights and laser targeting systems light up on automatic weapons
night vision goggles go up
rather than panicking the police are instantly in stealth mode communicating with quick urgent hand gestures
a handful of men splinter off for the vault while the rest separate into teams with practiced precision moving through the safe house ready for whatever comes
mika charges into the holding area the detail of men right at her heels
hold your fire raizos guards release their aim
christ good way to get yourself killed agent coretti
what the fucks with the lights
we got some guys in pajamas comin to play spin the bottle
one of them lifts a shotgun
i got something they can wrap their lips around
i dont have time for this shit
we have to move the prisoner
in the back of his cell raizos head lifts at the sound of mikas voice
goldenrod revised nd draft b
those arent our orders
raizo calls from behind the reinforced door
youve got to get out of here
she calls to his cell
not without you
raizos voice hangs in the gloom
then we all die together
one of the teams edges through the decay of the dilapidated industrial cavern
straining through the eyepiece of his goggles one of them mutters
dont see shit ahead the point man motions and the men take up defensive positions
the point man creeps forward a flicker of heat fluttering in his ir optic
through the darkness we see that his infrared is actually picking up the slow exhale of a ninja poised like a cobra inches away just above him
his blades flash and the detail of men recoil as their infrared sensors light up the point man cleft open in hot volcanic gore
a cloud of shuriken spit out of the darkness and punch into necks faces eyes
ten of them fall like wheat before a scythe
the rest fire hitting nothing
goldenrod revised nd draft c
the screams of dying men and gunfire shudder down the gullet of the old concrete building
she watches as the men position themselves pressing into the black of the corridor
thumbs flick safeties to hot
a shriek pierces the silence one of the agents suddenly jerked from his feet like a puppet on a string
they watch in ir as the agent falls to the ground in several pieces
what the fu s exclamation gets caught in the oozing slit that opens in his throat
the man guarding raizos cell door screams
theyre not showing up on ir
he clicks his flashlight the beam glinting against a hail of shuriken that pound into him wounds flowering in ribbons of red
mika watches as he lands wetly at her feet
more screams and gunfire shake the shock from her
she dives for the guard frantic fingers clawing at the key chain clipped to his belt
the remaining europol agents cluster together flashlights strobing spastically while mika slams through raizos cell door
she instantly goes to work on his leg irons
come on come on raizos eyes narrow the last of the europol agents butchered by shadows
goldenrod revised nd draft d
i dont want to sound critical he can feel the rush of darkness
the leg irons click open and raizo springs forward the chain of his handcuffs catching a falling blade
he twists and the ring of metal on metal is followed by the dry snap of bone as raizo breaks the ninjas neck
she releases his handcuffs and they move quickly through the glistening remains of the bodies raizo shielding her from the darkness
the two sprint from a stairwell into a concourse raizo stopping suddenly sensing the presence of the hanta kirra
he pushes her toward another set of stairs
he turns to facing the dark
she lurches up the stairs as the hanta kirra descend on him like a murder of crows
mika flies up the stairs taking the steps two at a time rounding the next flight a beam of light flashing weapons rattling suddenly trained on her
her stomach finds its way into her throat
goldenrod revised nd draft e
jesus ryan maslow rushes down to her another agent scanning the stairs above them
i thought you were mikas eyes widen as the agent on the flight above them is ripped into the air replaced by a squall of red
maslow whirls as a blade suddenly pierces his side but before it can continue its deadly cut maslow catches it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows
one of the hanta kirra falls tumbling past them down the stairs
maslow grunts as he rips the chain blade from his side
are you ok
he nods a bit woozy
i hope that wasnt my liver
gonna need that soon
sparks dance along the singing ringing blades the melee escalating in the darkness
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo meets the hanta kirra in the air
vaults from one wall and door to another spinning in and out of view as he moves through the shadows
the ninjas move with him matching his speed and ferocity and ability to disappear within the darkness
swords clash against chains and sword and walls
sparks fly and blood falls
this is the first time weve seen raizo turned loose
but its three on one
and takeshi isnt a pushover
mika and maslow slam through the exit into the building carpark
mika suddenly stops
goldenrod revised nd draft
the manuscript no mika he is about to argue but wilts at her resolve
he stuffs his car keys in her hand trying not to let his voice crack
keep it in gear
maslow he turns
he opens the door retracing their steps into the dark
mika suddenly very alone manages a slow nervous pirouette in the crypt like garage before skittering for maslows sedan
she slides in pulling the door shut behind her as quietly as she can and waits
maslow moves cautiously through the folds of midnight
he hears the fighting before he can see it
raizo blocks a sword thrust from takeshi
dodges around a hail of shuriken
uses his chain to drive another ninja back
takeshi rips free his left arm
draws a short angled blade and brings it slashing down at raizos neck
raizo blocks the knife with his elbow twists throws takeshi twenty feet through the air
he recovers mid flight like a cat and regains his balance
goldenrod revised nd draft
from the darkness a ninja fires a dozen shuriken at him and at least three of the spinning blades find their mark
raizo grunts at the impact but vaults up and over a counter and leaps through a window crashing out to the surrounding shadows seem to press in on the car
come on ryan
a figure darts in her periphery and her head whips around craning all directions
hurry the fuck up
ka chunk she punches the lock
click the headlights flash on ka chick she chambers the glock
motherfuckfuckfuck she twists the ignition and as the motor turns over the cars headlights explode shattered by projectiles that seem to materialize from the void
mika screams throwing the car into gear peeling out toward the down ramp
the car fishtails down level after level through the oscillating light dark of the dimly lit exit ramp
her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead a shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider
she ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a squall of stars
the sedan rebounds into the light
its hood and windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a great white
goldenrod revised nd draft
mika cranks the wheel tearing around a dark bend as toom
something lands on the roof of the car
above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as she passes under a light revealing a crouching
ninja staring right at her through the sun roof
his blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike she jams the barrel of the glock between the two tips of one set of claws right where his
foot should be and fires
a scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over the sunroof the ninjas body tumbling off the back of the car
maslows gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of sparks as it corners into traffic
mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell phone
the lights are still dead
maslow is with a team of europols moving through the stairwell
he talks quietly
ryan i had to leave
good stay clear
do you have the map
were heading upstairs now
wheres raizo goldenrod revised nd draft
he took off
we think they went after him
he looks into the surrounding shadows unsure
raizo parkours across the roofs the hanta kirra close behind
shuriken sizzle past some missing some lashing open whip cuts across his flesh
raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side
drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change
he looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight
and suddenly the ninja are on him
raizo blocks and parries
counterattacks with a reverse cut and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him
the truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death
raizo cartwheels over the hood forcing the scarred ninja to leap the other way and as he turns raizo comes down on him slashing his shoulder
the fight is now two one against one and one of them is takeshi
their swords crash back and forth sending sparks flying
raizo is tired already wounded by the shuriken
with a cry he hurls a second ninja back and spins to face takeshi
takeshis blade gets under his guard
opens up raizos side
his sword is ripped free from his hand rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo stumbles backward
lifes blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete
takeshi raises his sword high
this is the end for you brother
mikas car slashes across the width of the street screeching to a stop next to raizo
the door snaps open
raizo gets into the car
collapses into the seat arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side
she peels away before the others can stop her
mika carves a path through the traffic driving as fast as she can
eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas
raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump
his shirt is drenched with his own blood
what were you doing in the street
waiting for you
you have to go to a hospital
not a hospital
the car speeds into the night
the sort of store where the owner lives above the shop
mika pounds on the door as a light comes on in the floor above
a moment later the door opens
what is it
what he steps out of the way as mika helps raizo in bloody and half dead
goldenrod revised nd draft
herbalist places herbs into a hand grinder as raizo staggers through the rows of bowls grabbing what he needs and handing it to her
dong xia leaves
three of the lo chan
you should not mix these
raizo ignores him
gives her some more dried bits and pieces
the herbalist shakes his head
if you are in pain
if you wish to die
there are other ways this will be agony no
it will save me
beat let me write this down
he goes to find a pen and paper as mika grinds away
she goes to a tea kettle pours water into the bowl
he reaches for it and nearly collapses
she helps him raise the cup to his lips
tilts it and watches him drink
takes the empty cup away from him
raizo shudders as the drugs course through him
i have to sleep now
a day at least
his eyelids flutter
shes holding him up now muscles already loosening
what should i do
goldenrod revised nd draft
he slumps over the counter like a child dropping into deepest sleep as the herbalist comes back pen and paper in hand
he pauses as he sees mika standing over raizo
she looks from him to raizo and back again then ill have him to go
beat can you
help me to the car
mika is the proverbial bat outta hell
her phone is at her ear
the lights are back on but the place is trashed
mika where are you
he told me to keep moving
hes still alive
she glances at his slumped body
after a fashion
let us bring you in
not this time
mika the situations a little different
jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked
goldenrod revised nd draft
do you have the manuscript
he takes a breath
they got to my office
the news crushes her
mika its gonna be all right
well find them
but i promised
well keep your promise
theyre too many people involved now
its just a matter of time
i dont think we have much time
just tell me where you are
she hangs up
the car is parked outside the same hotel that he took her too
she steps out of the shower and dries herself with an evergreen branch
in the bedroom raizo is sprawled out on the bed
she is wearing new clothes
she takes a drag on a cigarette then passes the smoke over her body
goldenrod revised nd draft
i know you cant hear me so im sure this doesnt matter but im going to say it anyway
she looks at him
im a forensic researcher okay
thats like a fancy way of saying im a librarian
by myself i cant do anything to help you
she opens her fist inside is the tracking device maslow gave her
i wanted to think you for saving my life
bending over him she kisses him gently
and i hope you can forgive me for this
theres a crowd of other officials there having turned the place into a makeshift command and control center
an aide rushes in from an adjoining room goes to maslow
agent maslow the tracking device youve got a lock
triangulating her position now
mika watches from the trees as a shadow comes to life on the balcony outside their room
it pauses as if sensing something
raizo lies alone
the heavy shadows begin to undulate as the hanta kirra emerge
goldenrod revised nd draft
takeshis eyes gleam the way a blade gleams
police and europol cars scream up to the hotel
a moment later the door bursts open maslow and his men pour into the bedroom
the bed is empty
raizo is gone
mika is sitting in the chair
they took him
ten minutes ago
maslow embraces her
there is a furious storm raging outside the thin screened walls
raizo is watching kiriko who seems to be sleeping
in a flash of lightning her eyes open and she stares at him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye
the flashing ends and as the thunder booms she is gone melting quietly into the shadows
two shadows race through sheets of rain visible in flashes of lightning
he catches her near the base of the wall
you cant leave
i have to
goldenrod revised nd draft
because my heart is telling me too
the hanta kirra will come for you
then they will come
you know the law
he will cut your heart from your chest
he can never touch my heart
she puts his hand on her chest then leans in and kisses him
come with me
what is out there
he cannot imagine what that life might be
my life is here
she bows her head and turns
why are you doing this
because i cant watch you become something you are not
she races for the wall
he watches her climb
goldenrod revised nd draft a
raizo drifts on the edge of consciousness
he can sense some light filtering through the edges and air holes
the air begins to smell familiar
we have been betrayed
the clan is gathered outside the sun beats down on the spartan courtyard
kirikos body is twisted bound to a pole like one of the bonsai trees
ozunu delivers his eulogy
a child of mine my daughter betrayed us
she refused these gifts
rejected our clan
goldenrod revised nd draft
raizo stands among the clan his face a mask
hers is a shame that can only be purged with blood
he unsheathes the ancient wakizashi then offers the hilt to takeshi
you who returned her shall have this honor
takeshi hides a smile as he takes the blade
kiriko looks out into the clan and finds raizo
he can hear her heart pounding
takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to strike
blood pounds in raizos ears
the sword plunges into her heart
raizo hears it die and feels his own heart stop
a bucket of water slaps raizo awake
hes bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by thick rope that bites into his flesh
ozunu stands before him as well as the rest of the clan down to the youngest of them
he looks the same as he has in the flashbacks except that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length of his face
trace of raizos blade from atop the building in dubai
when he speaks ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the rest of the clan as to raizo
you are ozunu
your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the clan
this is our deepest truth
because of it we have endured for hundreds of years and will endure for hundreds more
goldenrod revised nd draft
he looks to the rest pounding the message home
the message that says hope and escape are futile
weakness compels strength
betrayal begets blood
this is the way of the nine clans
beat this is the way of the ninja
he looks back at raizo approaching slowly
taking his time
i have waited many years for this moment
i have dreamed it many times
he hits raizo
you will suffer for seven days one day for each year you defied me
he takes a knife and very carefully cuts out a very small piece of raizos flesh from the upper arm
raizo doesnt cry out
for seven days we will
from you as i have just done
everyone here will take from you
piece by piece
you will live through it all you will feel through it all
you will watch as the birds fight over the pieces
he strikes raizo as he did long ago his hand jutting deep inside gut flicking switches of nerves that cause instant agony
this time raizo does cry out
you will know pain like no other human being has ever known
he twists something in raizos belly and violent spasms wrack the young mans body
blood burbles up through his mouth and flows down his chin
goldenrod revised nd draft
your death will be remembered for a thousand years as a testament to the will and strength of the ozunu clan
one last gouge in raizos stomach sends a heaving shudder through him
confident victorious ozunu turns and walks a few steps away as raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor
takeshi smiles at this then looks more closely seeing something amidst the bile
ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder
a single led light blinking through the gore
he nudges it with his foot
and time slows down as he realizes what hes looking at
he slowly raises his eyes and meets raizos gaze as suddenly explosions rock the orphanages centuries old gate
a reinforced military humvee crashes through the cloud of splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of blinding lights
the ozunu clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves into the courtyard revealing behind it still more vehicles all equipped with brilliant lights
the ninjas take to the shadows trying to melt away but the shadows are gone
theres no place for the ninjas to hide anymore
we find mika and maslow in one of the lead vehicles as takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc raising it over raizos helpless form
maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off a long burst
takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and dodges the others
he slides into one of the few remaining shadows
goldenrod revised nd draft
one of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and fires an incendiary grenade
the explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous splashing through the courtyard but takeshi is gone
they prepare to fire another one when maslow comes on the run
no more grenades not until we get the children out
but some parts of the orphanage are already on fire the flames spreading through the ancient timbers
the carnage continues
maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as mika rushes for raizo pistol in hand
one of the mps screams as a shuriken rips open his face as other mps fire back at the ninja tearing him apart with gunfire
mika makes it to raizos side
he smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her knife
what took you
you knew id come
just because i was asleep doesnt mean i couldnt hear you
mika finishes with the rope
raizo pulls free and reaches for a fallen ninjas sword and chain
and i forgive you
mika looks back at the sound of gunfire tearing apart another ninja
when she looks back raizo is gone
goldenrod revised nd draft
the fires are ripping through the interior leaping from bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished wooden floors as raizo kicks down the burning wall of the empty dorm
the futons smoldering
raizo continues into the next hall to find takeshi waiting for him
an apparition in the wavering blaze of heat silhouetted against a wall of fire
come little brother let us play like old times they spring at other
meeting in the middle of the hallway as the flames dance around them
recalling the lanterns they used to fight through in the days of their training
their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on steel
neither giving an inch
evenly matched in skill and ferocity
locking together for a moment takeshi smiles
no death tasted as sweet as hers
raizos back glistens orange in the firelight sweat pouring as he strains attacks defends and attacks again
takeshi jumps over them twists mid air and ducks low beneath raizos swinging chain as raizo stumbles back on the polished floor blocking takeshis attack but takeshi catches his wrist
in an iron grip
as he brings his sword around raizo gets a loop of chain around the blade and locks it tight
both men spin in their sudden embrace
faces inches from each other
i watched you die when i pierced her heart
you have always been too weak to be ozunu
takeshis finger trips a hidden button on the sword
goldenrod revised nd draft
the blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of steel jolts out from the hilt of takeshis sword
he moves to slam it into raizos side
but raizo flips over him holding onto the hilt and as he lands he drives the steel into takeshis heart
he still stands for a beat more by inertia than will then slumps dead to the floor
raizo stalks down the hall
one last task ahead of him
raizo walks across the nightingale floor his bloody footprints moving soundlessly
from the shadows he hears ozunus voice you have not forgotten your training
you will always be mine child
raizo stops considers this then continues his footsteps now bringing every sound possible
ozunu steps out of the darkness as though shrugging off a cloak of midnight
perhaps this is the best way for you to die
his blade rises as like a cobras hood while the chain blade begins to spin
the breath i take after you are dead will be the first of my life
raizo unleashes all his fury the chain cutting with the power of an enormous buzz saw hacking timbers in half carving scars in the floors and walls braziers are thrown
fumes begin to spread but ozunu blocks or evades absorbing the assault patiently goldenrod revised nd draft
waiting for raizo to tire waiting for an opening
a portion of the orphanages wall burns through
mika spots raizo through the flames
she runs for him
raizo begins to weaken
an attack misses wrapping a beam and ozunu has his opening his assault is ferocious
wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out
raizo retreats his chain just blocking catching or deflecting the whirlwind attack until one sound cuts through the furious fight
snap zoom to ozunus ear as the hammer is cocked a cylinder spinning into place
die you fuck
she fires and ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him
a scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor
but the distraction gives raizo his chance
the blade whistles the chain snaps and blood arcs out of ozunu
rage thunders the hall
mika gets back up and aims but ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears
raizo goldenrod revised nd draft
she cannot see him
ozunus attack hits raizo with the force of a bomb burst his blade shatters through raizos chain hurling him back petals of blood fluttering from his chest
raizo tries to recover his chain now in two pieces
where is he
i cant see him
ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her a wraith
his eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull
she spins around but is too late
the ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as raizo finds them
he sees kiriko the same blade taking her life and howls his pain a force of nature unleashed
the chain blades crackle in the air dual cyclones that batter ozunus parrying blade which finally shatters against raizos fury
and with a final scream raizo lunges at his master the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates pieces hanging in mid air like an unstitched rag doll
raizo throws down the blood slick blades and hurries to mikas side
he picks mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door
the fighting is over now
all the combatant ninjas dead or long gone
goldenrod revised nd draft
maslow sees raizo emerge from the smoke and flames carrying mika in his arms
he runs to her side as raizo lays her gently on the ground
she saved my life
raizo puts his hand on her chest
closes his eyes
we can feel her heart beat
raizo opens his eyes
she will be all right
how can you be sure
raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath
he smiles distantly
her heart is special
over here now
several medics rush to them raizo gently laying her on the stretcher
as they immediately begin working on her raizo fades back
maslow remains at her side
her eyes flutter open
is she going to be okay
i dont know
shes got a hole right through the middle of her heart
but shes not really bleeding that badly
goldenrod revised nd draft
she points to the right side of her chest
is over here
you gotta be fucking kidding me
he said you saved his life
so you kept your promise
can we go home now
raizo stands among the bound trees
you shouldnt do that
kiriko releases one of the trees
i believe the heart of a tree knows which way it needs to grow
a raizo releases a tree
a trees dont have hearts
everything has a heart
goldenrod revised nd draft
she listens to his heart
hello in there
it said it was happy to meet me and that it missed you
he stands and looks at the wall
the storm lashes against them
come with me
he begins to climb
she kisses him
we hear his heartbeat
bump thump bump thump
as he stands on the edge of the wall
in the next moment he is gone and finally free
