pg presentation credits appear
out of black
shock cut to a mans face filling the screen
marcus filter stay away from here
were watching a video monitor
a pre recorded tape shows a view of what is obviously a pristine research laboratory
john marcus in a lab coat faces the camera disheveled and looking like a madman
filter this lab must remain sealed
overhead lamps cast pools of light down onto a conference table onto the hands of people assembled to observe the video
we see no faces
but expensive watches sleeves with high ranking stripes indicate wealth power and a military presence
the video on the wall behind marcus we see shadows darting frantically
we hear voices rising in panic
filter for gods sake dont come in
the camera is swatted by a hand that lurches suddenly into the foreground
we only see it for a few video frames but we might subliminally notice lesions on the flesh
the image swirls wildly
the next clear picture we see
is of the same laboratory
the camera is lying on its side on the floor
voice in the room o
a laser pointer casts a red dot on a corner of the video screen indicating a hunched figure leaning over a human body apparently
with a grunt the figure turns
and lunges its face covered with blood at the camera
the image swirls again and the screen goes black
with a music sting a single title appears full across the blackness
pg a dark sky
and in the foreground profiled against a full moon a dark face
watching the heavens with piercing black eyes alert though not predatory
this is chris redfield young handsome
more than simply an outdoor type he seems perfectly in place almost part of the environment
a band of purple tints the horizon outlining the tops of magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles
sitting on a ridge squinting into that band of light chris sees
an eagle coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through the hilltops
as the bird moves swiftly closer it becomes recognizable
chris smiles and jots a note on a pad
the regal bird lands on a high rock where
a freshwater trout lies flapping three thousand feet above the highest water
take it goliath
goliath snaps up the fish and flies away with it
see ya next year guy
chris reaches into a water filled bucket pulls out another trout climbs efficiently unerringly across a precarious cliffside and deposits the fresh fish on the same high rock
another eagle smaller a female appears in the sky
chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note
cleopatra spots the fish pumps her wings and swoops down
shes about to snap up the prize but at the last minute she recoils and climbs again hovering
come on down
the eagle circles its sharp eyes scanning
it makes another dive but stops short again
whats the matter beautiful
the bird seems frightened
it makes one more dive
gets very close to the fish
but suddenly shrieks and peels away from the rock
chris sees its eyes looking crazed as it soars right past him its wings brushing his hair
pg close on chris concerned as he watches the eagle disappear over the hills
over his shoulder we can see the high rock that holds the fish
its out of focus in the background but the moonlight catches something moving there
something that lets out a sharp inhuman sound
chris whirls around
theres nothing on the rock
nothing at all
the fish has been taken
chris walks into a characterless apartment
he quietly sheds his clothes
even in silhouette we can see that his body is in perfect shape not pumped but lean and tight
moving lithely with the natural grace of a cat he eases himself into a bed where
a beautiful young girl jill valentine seems to be fast asleep
as chris nestles in beside her we see that her eyes facing away are open
chris gently drapes an arm around her and lets his body relax
a whisper glad youre still here lady its my apartment
surprised youre awake
ive been awake
since you left
his apology goes no further
hes still troubled by what happened in the hills
what with my dinner
i never had a mother
chris smiles politely
ill do the cooking
pg but he cant switch focus
on the mountain
must have been something
prowling around up there
there are probably all kinds of things prowling around up there
in the middle of the night
chris apologizes again this time more sincerely
have to be there at dawn
they ride the wind over the ridge
you left at one a
i had to go fishing
its the fish that bring them down so i can get a close look at them
enthused ive tracked a dozen of them jill
twelve of those big bruisers
i can actually recognize them
ive even given them names over the years
youve been doing this for years
only in the early autumn
when theyre migrating
iii set the alarm for next
jill rolls over and faces him
i wish i could get excited
thats the truth
as excited as you over such
if it was
id be beautiful
pg no no no
you on the other hand
have all that
hiding underneath somewhere
thats what fascinates me
jill is being playful
chris taking her question to heart becomes introspective
honestly dont know
i guess ive been
living alone too long
youre the first the only woman ive ever thought of as
a real partner
now jill becomes introspective
ive always been
afraid of living alone
ive always had
talking at me
knowing they could wind me up and id do
whatever they wanted
chris looks into her eyes
she kisses him gently
we all have
beauty may not be simple
but its not all that complicated either
most of the time you find it
right in the middle of all the
im part mohawk
indians are never confused
at least they never let it show
they kiss again this time more passionately
rolling over they begin to make love
the purple horizon is turning orange but its still quite dark when a crusty old farm hand rake opens the creaking door of a stable and with a flashlight leads
three horses out into the morning breeze
two dogs a lab and a spaniel romp at his heels as rake opens a log gate
pg two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large corral
the third a beautiful stallion resists snorting tossing its head in high spirit
get in there lucky
quit horsin around
lucky moves into the corral strutting proudly
if i didnt know you was just an animal id say you was all full of yourself
get in there
rake waves his flashlight not meanly there is clearly a great deal of affection here
rake shuts the gate behind the stallion who begins to gallop around happily inside the fence
all seems lovely until
the dogs suddenly go on point
their ears perk
they sniff the air
and begin to whine
whats wrong with you two
a startling sound
rake turns to find lucky and the other horses their eyes flaring trying to kick their way out of the fencing
they seem terrified
a wide shot of rake and the frightened animals from two hundred yards away
the camera moves in slowly at first then gaining speed
we are seeing through the eyes of
whatever it is thats running charging slathering hungrily
reaching the corral darting through the fence past the kicking horses and leaping at rake who whirls around
and cries out in pain as his flashlight blinds us with whiteness
the whiteness becomes the glare of halogen lights
we are overwhelmed by the sound of aircraft engines
we see men armed soldiers scrambling into combat helicopters
a radio man runs right toward the camera holding out an open receiver
top brass sir
pg another man in the foreground takes the radio phone
we cant see his face
only his forearm which bears a tattoo of a grinning skull
voice on phone o
filter how long before you get in there
a suit talks on a red telephone
once again we see no face
an ostentatious diamond ring kicks light as the man snips off the end off a monte cristo
youre good soldier
but not that good
its five hundred miles away
in the backwoods of pennsylvania
man with tattoo o
filter we have troopers on site
a first strike force
the flame from a wooden match lights the monte cristo
you have my permission activate them
ive already done that
you have my permission
to say that you gave me permission
the tattooed man runs off to join the other soldiers
jill is awake deep in thought when
its not a ring its a vibration
jill reaches down and extracts something small and black the size of a box of tic tacs from one of her shoes
she gets out of bed checking to see that chris is still asleep and moves into
pg a bathroom
closing the door behind her she puts the small box to her ear extracts a wire from it with a tiny microphone on its tip and
we cant hear the voice that speaks to her
if this is just another a drill ill strangle you
she listens shit
give me the activation code
jill pulls a small envelope from a toiletry bag
she breaks open a wax seal
and takes out a thick paper on which is printed
gaping not believing th thats a match
beat im on my way
jill clicks off
she dumps something else from the envelope into her hand
a blue plastic card the size of a visa blank except for a mag stripe
theres a small hole in one corner through which a chain is strung
jill slings the chain over head wearing the blue card like a pendant
chris is still asleep
jill comes out of the bathroom and looks down at him longingly
should she wake him
tell him whats happening
she wants to but duty prevents it
she pulls herself away
tchik tchik tchik
jill pushes aside hangers which hold her clothes
she types numbers into a hidden keypad
a secret panel opens revealing a closet within the closet packed with combat uniforms and weapons
of the front door closing snaps chris awake
his first thought is for his lover
he reaches out and finds that
shes not in bed
he jumps up rushes to a window looks down from the second story and sees
pg jill heavily armed in uniform wearing a beret that has an insignia
she rushes down the front path and jumps into a hummer with three other troopers on board
the vehicle pulls instantly away
leaving chris looking through the window puzzled angry and very much wounded
williams and disimone sit in the back all tough special forces types
jill in the front passenger seat though the only female ranks the highest
another practice run right
we been practicin six months
this is the real deal
honest to god
based on my experience williams god isnt always honest where we goin
jill points into the arkley forest which lies ahead
miles of old growth trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist
deep in the heart of the mist
the hummer bounces over non roads and stops fifty yards from
a pair of iron gates each wrought with the letter a
beyond the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of
the troopers amazed climb out and approach the gates
pg if you had the jing to build a place like this would you build it in the middle of fuckin nowhere
wistfully some people prefer
a quiet life
back to business our orders are to secure the area
this areas been secure since the french and indian war
a deep animal snarl comes from the woods
the troopers raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush
the fog keeps sunlight from penetrating
the forest is a maze of dark shadows
dark shapes can be seen moving circling
a half dozen of them
jill whips out a transmitter and quickly types an access code
into radio this is valentine bravo team
we might be in trouble here
something leaps out of the brush
automatic weapons spit reflexively
kritch kritch kritch
more lunging shaes appear
the troopers scatter firing as they are attacked from all sides
jill dives for the shrubbery shouting into her transmitter
jills voice stutters over a headset which is pressed against jill o
filter under attack
the shot widens as the man lowers his headset
first we see the tattoo on his arm
a grinning skull which we recognize
then gradually we see his face
lean and mean wearing dark sunglasses this is albert wesker a hard assed career officer
can you get a trace
the pilot laguardia responds
lost the beacon
it just cut out
like it was
swallowed by something
oddly wesker smiles
i do believe gentlemen
that were gonna be earning some combat pay
there are three other men on board
the closest to wesker is barry burton a muscular black man as big as a grizzly with the heart of a teddy
damn if you dont love a fight
hey if i didnt
youd be a dead man
to the pilot call in a nine nine
i want raccoon city e vacked
wesker and the men fly from the lens
the camera passes out through one of the helicopters windows as the chopper soars away
when the shot widens we see other hueys
black unmarked keeping formation
ten of them
the troopers are under assault by thrashing inhuman shapes
jill rolls into a natural trench
disimone is behind her williams is crawling just ahead his legs pumping
jill scoots past him and sees that
those legs arent moving on their own
theyve been ripped away from williams torso and are being dragged into the underbrush by some
concealed in the thick brush so we never get a clear look at it
other beasts attack disimone
we see only details
jill fires her pistol point blank
to no avail
red rimmed eyes snarling jaws drooling teeth descend on her as we cut to pg chris steps out of jills building
suddenly incongruously camo painted hueys swoop down out of the sky
the choppers land where they can
commandos leap out and begin to cordon off the town
theres been an accident in the hills nearby
a military aircraft carrying live weapons has crashed
chris runs down a side street into an alley where hes trapped by commandos both in front and behind
lets go hayseed
aiming his m you gonna be a good boy
chris swallows his fury
gritting his teeth he goes along with the soldiers prodded by rifle barrels out onto
main street where there is chaos
an orwellian sight as citizens find themselves horded into helicopters and trucks from the local national guard post
a sweating man still in his pajamas rushes up to the soldiers that are escorting chris
look here im the sheriff of this
but im the sheriff
an ex army man like you
there is no immediate danger but as a precaution we are evacuating the area
you will be provided shelter until the weapons have been removed from the crash site
pg thats a worn out scenario
if a plane crashed nearby dont you think somebody would have heard it go down
tell us the truth guys
whats this really about
i said step aside
the soldier lifts his rifle
hes about to club the sheriff when chris lunges grabbing his arm
chris kicks the soldier in the balls
the man buckles
one of the other commandos fires at him a loud burst which misses chris but shatters a shop window setting off wild panic on the street
chris ducks into a building
and out a rear door
he runs through a warren of back alleyways arriving at
a jeep sahara which is parked behind jills apartment building
he jumps in without opening the door jams the key into the ignition and roars off
still airborne in one of the black helicopters that have yet to reach the site wesker barks orders into a radio
charlie david edward proceed to raccoon city
assist the e vack
im going on target with alpha team
all forces stand ready to support
chris rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque farm secluded deep in the forest
we dont recognize it immediately
it was dark when we last saw the place
jumping out chris sees three large shapes lying in the grass of a corral
rushing over chris realizes
one of them is lucky his prize stallion
dead in a pool of blood with its belly torn open and a huge chunk out of its neck
pg chris hears a weak moaning sound
he turns and sees
rake lying near a water pump
chris rushes to the mans side and finds him brutally slashed barely clinging to life
coughing blood they
they come outta the trees reddy
dont know what they was
maybe some kinda
wolves or somethin
examining the mans wounds chris realizes theyre fatal
i never seen em comin
dont try to talk rake
never left this farm
since yer daddy first took it over
kept the place runnin
better than me
never seen em comin reddy
had a chance to
turn a gun on em
theres a thunder in the sky
chris looks up
weskers fleet of black hueys appears on the horizon
they split up seven banking off toward raccoon city the remaining three grinding ahead over the forest slowing down dropping in altitude
where are they going
theres nothing in there
when you was a kid
the old arkley place
i remember them days
i surely do
them old days
chris looks back down at the old man who is drifting starting to lose it
pg chris cont
im not gonna bullshit you rake
in a bad time
if theres any way to save you ill find it i swear
hang in there old guy
ill be right back
chris jumps to his feet and runs into
the great room of the farmhouse
chris snatches up a telephone
theres no dial tone
the line is dead
chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old winchester rifle
he scoops ammo from a drawer into a shoulder bag and runs back outside
where his eyes catch movement in the corral
lucky entrails spilling is trying to stand
oh god rake
oh jesus the poor things still alive
chris shoulders his ammo bag reaches inside and quickly reloads the winchester
stepping forward he aims carefully
sorry old hoss
a clean shot to the horses brain drops the animal
it takes chris a long moment to recover
then he looks into the trees
the helicopters are no longer in sight but their thunder remains
they havent landed yet
chris turns and rushes back to rakes side only to find
he has died
chris jaws tighten but he has no time to mourn
he closes rakes eyes
digs through the grass
pulls up a handful of dirt
stuffs it into the old mans hand and closes his stiffening fingers over it
the earth keeps us
conquering his emotions chris runs to his jeep and jumps in
he shifts into four wheel drive and ignoring the road heads straight over the field for the trees
as the jeep disappears the camera cranes down zooming pg one of the farm dogs
not the entire animal but one of its three separate parts
its front end
crushed head bloody neck and a single broken paw
which is trying to crawl
fifty yards away rakes hand relaxes
the earth spills out through his fingers as the dead mans eyes
the first of the black hueys drops hazardously into a small clearing with barely enough space
unable to land on the scrub brush it hovers ten feet off the ground
its rotors clip tree leaves as wesker barry and two other s
commandos jump out heavily armed
the chopper lifts off placed by huey number two
not far away chris navigates through undergrowth until he can see the helicopters through the trees
the thunder from their rotors masks the grinding of chris jeep
he pulls within a hundred yards and leaving his vehicle in the bush moves closer cautiously on foot
the third huey air drops two men and two women in s
there are twelve commandos in all
wesker looks up at the hueys pilot using his radio to speak to the man
youll have to rotate or youll run out of fuel but i want one chopper to remain in the air at all times
we might need help in a hurry
a roger that squaks back as the huey banks away
barry looks worried
his instincts are asking
we might need
we only see this in his eyes he says nothing as
wesker leads the team through the woods unaware of
chris following behind crouching around trees and bushes not a trained commando but comfortable with the land a natural warrior using ancestral instincts
the camera tracks combat boots as they crunch through the low lying mist
stopping abruptly when they encounter
weapons ammo belts bits of shrdded uniforms
and human body parts
strewn all through the surrounding brush remnants of what was obviously a feeding frenzy
brad vickers vomits
unarmed hes alpha teams computer techie
not a combat soldier hes a bit of a coward
another non combatant rebecca chambers is the teams medical officer
she digs an ammonia capsule from her pack and holds it under vickers nose
richard aiken and kenneth sullivan are buddies regular g
joes right out of every war movie
aiken stares at the carnage calmly chewing a wad of gum
you ever eat road kill sullivan
a guy with a brain your size would be better off dead
want me to shoot ya aiken
rosie rodriguez a tough body built babe steps in
im ready ta shoot somebody
forest speyer a wiry willem defoe type finds a bloody beret and brings it to wesker
theres an i
tag on the brim
reading the tag valentine
beat radio washington
bravo team found on site
in the bushes chris overhears not wanting to believe
he sees wesker angrily pitch jills beret into the brush
were goin in
watch your backs
wesker advances his troops
when the coast is clear chris rushes in picks up the beret and sees the name tag for himself
after what happened at the farm
feeling sucker punched defeated chris hangs his head
one of the hueys dips in low
pg chris looks up
the sight of the war machine lifts him from defeat
his eyes are soft for the last time as he tucks jills beret into his pack
when he looks up again those eyes have become newly predatory
he ducks out of sight as the helicopter swings lower
downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle catching chris attention
he realizes that
its not just the wind
the shrubs are being disturbed by
something dark which is moving through them
it pokes its head out
rake was right
chris readies his winchester as the animal stalks forward
its not a wolf
its a dog
mottled its flesh gray covered with rotting lesions
and it has three bleeding bullet holes in its belly chest neck
it leaps at chris
up ahead wesker and his commandos freeze
before anyone can answer the team is attacked by more dogs which burst out of the surrounding woods
dobermans and shepherds
but something is seriously wrong with all of them
their eyes are dead their flesh decaying
automatics piss streams of lead
hot rounds tear through the animals many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains
of his bullets hits its target
one of the dogs heads
the commandos are backed up against
the iron gates we saw earlier
the arkley mansion stands beyond
lets get inside
shouting i want em all the dogs dont stand a chance
alpha teams firepower is overwhelming
but there is a human casualty
joseph frost trips and falls
one of the dogs pounces on him chewing out his heart
through his back
wesker steps in riddling the dead man and the dog with forty rounds from his m
pg in the next instant another dog leaps at wesker from behind
he hears its snarl
he dives into the grass
the dog is about to land on him when
its blasted out of mid air by
even steven boss
you saved my ass in the desert
i saved yours i in pennsylvania
wesker stand straightening his ever present sunglasses
i dont believe in being
even steven with anybody
a man saves my ass
i pay him back
before this day is over ill pay you back barry
stick with me okay
wesker checks his equipment belt
something is missing
he looks to where he rolled in the grass
using a flash light he finds
a small electronic unit the size of a cell phone
but its not a cell phone
whatever it is
wesker clips it onto his belt
from the brush chris sees all this
the guns have gone silent
the attack seems to be over
chris moves stealthily to the body of the animal that he shot
its wearing a collar which reads
alongside the i
theres a corporate looking logo
the symbol of an umbrella
another dog is advancing on chris
he aims his winchester
the magazine is empty
no time to reload
the dog is on him
chris scrambles away
the dog bounds after him
chris drops to the ground
did he trip
he pushes a tree root which is false
it swings open and he dives in pulling the root shut over him
the dog arrives an instant later
it lets out an angry howl
and is blown away
by rodriguez who neither saw chris nor where he went
the forest goes dead quiet
theres not even the chirping of morning birds wesker is slapped startlingly on the back
pg look here man
id follow you into any kind of enemy fire
but these things aint firin at us
they want us for breakfast
when are you gonna tell us what the hell is goin on here
when you need to know
just do your job soldier
thats what im doin
wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt
it holds a card the size of a visa like the one jill found in her secret envelope only weskers isnt blue its green
stepping away from barry he slide the card through a slot in the iron gate frame
the gates swing open with a rusty squeal
chris crawls through a long dark shaft with earthen walls a man made tunnel
at the mansions front door a hand carved monolith of solid oak wesker finds another hidden slot and swipes his card
the giant door creaks open
inside the place looks like a haunted house a glorious ruin once spectacular now mysterious and threatening
the chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls
indistinct noises echo within the ceiling the floor as alpha team enters
they probably dont have cable
they probably dont have radio
whos place is this
wesker shuts the front door
the booming sound makes us wonder if we will ever see it opened again
pg guy named arkley
built this old fortress during prohibition
he figured nobodyd ever find him out here in the back woods
till he died
feds have had it ever since
place has been here for eighty years
a safe house
a safe house
a secret installation
a network of laboratories
what kind of
shrugging they didnt issue us gas masks so i figure
its okay to breathe
why send in a strike force
what are we supposed to do
polish the silver
theres a man downstairs
a top priority man
its our job to
bring him out
hopefully there are others alive as well
well rescue them too
if we can
he comes out alive at any and all cost
though its still morning the windows are sealed over
no sunshine can enter
from this point on
there will be no indication of time
except as shown on clocks
a sense of dread takes hold of us as
dark shadows lurch
feet scrape sluggishly
not in combat boots but in nikes loafers dr
past an accordion gate of corroded bronze
a motor hums
behind the gate an old fashioned service elevator rises
but stops just below floor level
eyes peer out waiting for the shuffling feet to pass
then the car rises the rest of the way revealing its occupant
pg jill valentine
she deactivates the elevator by pulling her blue access card out of an incon gruously modern receptacle
checking to be sure that the coast is clear she slides the accordion gate aside and steps out into the corridor
with a ghostly moan something lunges at her out of the shadows
its a man in a lab coat
his skin is rotting his teeth snapping like the dogs
he tries to bite jill not merely to do injury
he seems hungry
jill leaps aside lifting her pistol and firing
once twice three times
the man is shot in the stomach heart neck
but he keeps coming
finally jill shoots him in the head
and he falls
jill quickly reloads on instinct
but as she does it she stares at the corpse frowning weighing life long belief against the hideous facts of the moment
wesker and his troopers hear the gunshots
there are three doors nearby
wesker selects one that seems to lead to the source of the gunshots
using his card he unlocks it
three men stay here
im not a man
im better than a man
wesker grins but hardly skips a beat
you come with us
aiken sullivan stick here with chambers
the troop moves out
aiken and sullivan remain in the central hall with rebecca
i dunno why me
i guess the c
figures youre as worthless as a dame aiken
pg sullivan catches rebeccas eye
sorry ma am
i meant aiken
i get it
wesker leads his troop into an enormous cobwebbed library lined with book shelves but no books
there are doorways on all four walls
wesker pulls out something that looks like a game boy
he types on a keypad
a map of the mansion appears
wesker scrolls with the arrow keys
barry looks on very impressed with the high tech unit
tells you where to go
wesker doesnt answer
he pockets the game boy
one man stays here
shoot to kill
just make sure its not one of us
the rest of you
wesker leads his squad through one of the doorways
ridley a young rookie remains
chris reaches the end of the earthen tunnel
there are signs that children once played here
chris finds his nickname
etched in hardened mud
after a moment of reflection he moves on into
a small sheet rock chamber
chris rushes to a door that looks like its been there since the beginning of time
as soon as he touches the knob
an alarm sounds
ridley standing guard hears the alarm
he hears chris jiggling the knob
but he sees no door
the walls around him seem to be solid slabs
pg chris cant get the doorknob to turn
behind him a dusty oriental carpet bulges upward
one corner flops aside
ridley is spooked by the sound
frightened trembling he un slings his rifle
chris doesnt hear the trooper
behind him a decomposed hand pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet
finds purchase on the floor
chris is unaware of the danger
he hurls himself against the door
he cant break through
the thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man once a scientist
its wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick eyeglasses
but its long dead
as it pulls itself up its eyeglasses strike the side of the ditch
they fall clattering the rims scraping the zombies cheek which peels away like onion skin
chris hears the noise
turns and sees
the dead man reaching out hungrily
chris is trapped
he aims his winchester
the zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor
chris digs in his shoulder bag
pulls out a handful of bullets and with them accidentally jills beret
rising emotion stops him for a moment
the dead man crawls toward him
chris might not have time to load
as he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle the zombie swats at him
catches the beret
looks at it
the bullet pops out of chris nervous fingers
he tries to load another
ridley spots a blue access slot in the wall
he levels his automatic and chews the thing up with a short burst
a panel swings open
chris dives out
with the zombie inches behind him
ridley fires off another burst of rounds
pg stray bullets pierce the zombies head
it drops back into the chamber
with ridley never knowing why
ridley and chris look at each other asking rapid fire questions none of them answered
who are you
who are you
what the hell is howd you get in here
who sealed the door
who knew there a door
another zombie appears suddenly behind ridley biting out the muscle between his shoulder and neck
the trooper stands stunned for a moment
then he drops
the zombie in a uniform once a security guard gazes dully at chris
a wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it calmly chews on ridleys flesh
swallowing it reaches out
chris grabs its arms flings it into the chamber
then fires his winchester once putting a hole in the things head
chris slams the door
in a hearst sized dining room with draped furniture wesker and the other troopers have heard the new gunfire
whered that come from
where we just were
shit man were chasin our tails
pg chris hears the clattering of the troopers heading his way
what he doesnt hear is
a slight crackling
in the walls
wesker and his team burst into the corridor with the old fashioned elevator
the body of the zombie that was shot by jill bullet holes allover its body
surnbitch took a lotta lead
thats not what killed him
bloods still running
wounds are fresh
but look at his skin
this guys been dead for a couple of days
he was dead
before he was shot
chris checks ridley
his own rustling movements prevent him from hearing
that soft crackling sound
the kitchen is lined with fifty year old ivy patterned wallpaper
the printed vines seem to be moving
chris doesnt notice until the vines begin to wiggle furiously
and rip through the paper
sprouts from some sort of exotic plant that have climbed up the walls
they seem aware of chris presence
rebecca has appeared in an open doorway
chris looks at her with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders
im one of the good guys okay im just trying to
pg chris familiar with the room opens a small door in the wall barely man sized and almost invisible because its covered in matching wallpaper
chris dives in
aiken and sullivan pop up behind rebecca having barely caught a glimpse of chris
who was that
what are they
sullivan points at the vines
which are swirling groping as if alive making their way toward ridleys body
in a laundry chute propping himself against the sides chris descends
as he did as a child
and comes out onto
a drop ceiling newly installed
iron frames support air filtration systems and other heavy machinery
sheet metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia
light from somewhere below knifes through gridded iron vents
somebody did some major remodeling
the vines continue to advance
we gotta get him out
the troopers rush to retrieve ridleys body
the vines hover around them occasionally darting then pulling back as if they were timid animals hungry but afraid of anew food dish
when aiken brandishing his m the vines recoil and retract fully
thwip thwip thwip
behind the wallpaper and down
somewhere into the bowels of the house
smart fuckin plants
no big deal
most plants are smarter than you aiken
pg the others are still puzzling over the downed zombie
why would anyone shoot a dead man
maybe cause he was
barry steps closer to the corpse notes its collapsed skull
we were sprayin those dogs outside
but think about it
were any of em brought down without a head shot
wesker has been exploring the corridor
stopping in front of the elevator he shines his light into the car
we expect someone
or some thing
to be lurking inside
an attack comes from the opposite direction
a figure bursts out of the shadows behind weasker
in a rage she holds her pistol to weskers head
i lost three me
you killed them wesker
and i did
because i didnt know what to expect
didnt tell me
calmly tell you what
i wasnt told anything
put down the gun
instead jill clicks the hammer back
put down the gun
slowly reluctantly she lowers her gun
pg wesker turns
and recognizes her
did you get in here
sarcastic how ya doin valentine
good to see ya
glad youre still alive
same here colonel im
how did you get in here
exploding the same way those fuckin dogs got out
through their pens
relaxing some i
locked them off
a voice interrupts from the end of the corridor
the voice is sullivans
the troopers run to join him
last to leave the corridor are wesker and jill
wesker gestures gallantly
the troopers trickle into the kitchen to find
rebecca kneeling over ridleys corpse examining the ragged bite on its neck
theyre in the house
more of them dogs
diameters too small
almost looks as if
it was done by a
arriving a human
rebecca looks up
the two women make sisterly eye contact
pg yes but
what kind of
would do something like this
not a vegetarian thats for sure
aiken youd be better off
there was a guy
not part of the team
and there was
some kind of
gimme a fuckin break
right into the wall
rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall paper near where shes standing
i guess its
time to spill it
wesker pulls off his dark glasses for the first time
i dont know
much more than i already told you
ill tell you the rest now
the labs hare are
working on special apps for bio eng neered materials
speak english hombre
marcus has been experimenting with an artificial
the t virus
financing came from a private corporation you may have heard the name
so huge that they have
in high places
thats why were here
pg this virus
it jumped right
were all dead
we got the bug and were all dead
its not airborne
it was spread
in the water supply
lab animals and
the researchers themselves
passed it on
wesker hangs his head
its an affirmation
you catch this virus and
not for long
revives the brain and
you stand back up
and chew on the first guy you see
christ this is like
night of the living dead
why in the name of jesus would anybody wanna mess with shit
that does that shit
civilization has come a long way but we still have
a soldier who cant die
was the concept
but the virus
if we got all the dogs
weve contained it
why didnt you tell us
pg by telling you now ive put your lives in jeopardy
nobody has this information
except a few high and mightys
and now you
the troopers fall silent as all this sinks in
we have to get marcus out of here
he developed this thing
hes the only one who
i dont know this all sounds pretty shaky to me
with a lightning move wesker draws his pistol and
the bullet flies past her and shatters the skull of ridley the dead trooper who having stood up was about to attack rebecca from behind
guess that proves it
a head shot knocks em down
rebecca turns and looks at the blood splattered body
th that man
im a doctor
i should know
that man was dead
vickers reaches in rebeccas bag pulls out an ammonia capsule cracks it and holds it under her nose
i hope you have a lot of these
chris crawls across the drop ceiling into the up rising light from one of the vents
he looks down through the grid work and sees
the same laboratory that was behind marcus in the opening video
no longer pristine its wrecked torn apart
files are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of furniture and computer hardware
cages that line the walls are filled with lab animals making nervous chatter
chris watches a monkey sip water from a dish
like the other animals its skin is rotting
pg chris is about to move on when his eye catches
outside the cages
theres a man in a lab coat sitting at a desk writing on a note pad
close on the mans hand
the pen it holds is making only random erratic marks
the man turns his head slowly to look up toward the voice
theres nothing left of his face
raw tissue seeps odd colored fluids
a single eyeball is nested tenuously in the ooze
something like a mouth recognizable only because of its position opens
chris pumping his winchester hears
a noise from below
he looks down again just as
the lab door bursts open
wesker and alpha team stream into the lab
the thing with
the destroyed face turns toward the invaders stands and shuffles toward them
without hesitation wesker on point fires a quick burst into the things brain
it drops like a sack
the lab animals shriek
the team files in not noticing
crawling across the floor
heading directly for speyer
chris shouts chris cont
he punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle and
punches a sure fire hole in the zombies head
brad vickers his nerves badly frayed thinks the team is being attacked
he sprays the ceiling with his automatic
chris ducks and rolls narrowly escaping the initial barrage but bullets keep coming punching a dotted line up through the ceiling panels
chris scrambles as fast as he can his feet barely escaping the punch holes
he finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents and plexiglas panels
bullets weaken the framework
then cracks dropping away
chris is plunged into
chris kicks paddles with his rifle righting himself getting his bearings
hes in a huge aquarium thats built into one of the laboratorys walls
and hes not alone
there are six sharks in the tank
zombie sharks their flesh rotting leaking pus
the largest of them snaps at chris but its jaws catch only a clump of his swirling hair
chris kicks with his feet remaining upright and fires his wet winchester
the bullet wimps out restrained by the water
it penetrates the shark but barely
we can see the casing lodged in the animals flesh
chris gets an idea
he kicks forward
plants the barrel of his winchester directly against the aquarium glass
only to find himself aiming directly at
jill who is aiming back at him with her m
theyre both stunned
they stare at each other for a moment like gunfighters until
another shark circles in for an attack
chris swings the winchester away from jill and fires underwater
the aquarium glass cracks
were gonna get wet
more cracks but the glass is resistant
water surges into the lab knocking wesker and some of his squad down
they stand up again only to find themselves knee high in a dark pool
with shark fins slicing the surface
everybody opens fire
the dead fish keep coming
where the fuck is a sharks brain
in its head
i swear aiken you would be better off dead
in a bizarre frenzy the sharks kick their tails making startlingly quick turns darting every which way snapping at the scent of warm flesh
the troopers hampered by the water splash around wildly many of them nearly getting bitten
the air above thickens with a fog of graphite from ten spitting automatics
pg the water gets darker as it becomes clouded with blood
but thankfully the level is dropping
the water is seeping out through grates in the floor
the sharks become more visible moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor
the troopers pick them off one by one
the immediate threat passes
but as the water drains away the troopers become aware of
a klaxon like sound
the entry door glides shut with a booommm
very nice valentine
you set off a containment breach
it must have been the water
god the water
she turns to chris did you swallow any
a bunch of us did man
wesker looking crazed his sunglasses gone is typing on his game boy
getting no response
we can go in deeper
but we cant get out
not with my card key
we live here now
rosie finds sullivan looking at her curiously
kicked my family out of six apartments
i got use to sayin
we live here now
there are override exits
but i cant find them without this
wesker flings his game boy angrily against a wall
it shatters into bits
pg that was a smart move
hes about to confront chris but he spots his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by the water
he walks over and picks them up wiping the lenses on his shirt
without looking at chris he asks
a local guy
chris spots a dry lab coat hanging on a wall hook
he takes it down and uses it to dry his rifle
who gets pissed off when he finds
his farm animals
and his fathers oldest friend
and the only woman he ever cared about turns out to be a goddam metal head
wesker while seeming to understand still doesnt look up
who is this asshole
his name is chris redfield
part of my cover sir
a snappy argument develops a lovers quarrel with higher than normal stakes
this is not the time to mouth off chris
youre in deep shit here
why didnt you let me in on this
why did you have to come after me
how did you get in here anyway
i used to play here when this was a fucking laundry room
and what makes you think i came after you
pg interrupting whoa
barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that wesker shot
he rips an i
badge from the corpses coat
he tosses it to wesker who reads the i
marcus barry cont
is this the pile of shit were supposed to bring out of here
it once was
i got something here
brad has been quietly working at one of the labs computers
barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen
same as on your gizmo
blue and green
wesker steps in for a look
the greens are the overrides
to brad can you print this out
i can try
chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor
he wrings out the cloth and using the lab coat wipes the bullets dry
off the screen were on level a
we have to get down to level d
marcus is dead
if this mission was about bringin him out were outta here right
i wish we were but no
we have a potential outbreak here
we might be the only ones who can stop it
pg stop it
everyones ears perk
we cant bring marcus out but we can bring out the serum
can analyze it
and figure how to beat the virus
jill looks at chris
catches him weighing options
privately not simple
privately not complicated either
we only have to decide
and whats wrong
privately i forgot
youre never confused
whats right mohawk
and whats wrong
at the computer there are no green exits on this level
why would that be
they dont want anybody up here to go snoopin
upstairs or down
wesker looks at chris with that odd confident smile
pretty good guess
you must have been in the military son
typing starting to panic fuck
theres no way out
yes there is
chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium
pg wesker looks up
then looks back at chris
not a bad idea
turning to vickers see if you can call up
service charts schematics
brads fingers fly
he scrolls through menus
ceiling grids ladders
the whole infrastructure
print all of it
the young man types a command
wesker rushes over to the h
and grabs the first chart that rolls out
rebecca steps over to brad
she points at his leg
seated at the computer his trousers hiked blood can be seen on his sock just above his boot
whats that from
on the desk
when we were scrambling
lemme look at it
its just a scratch
chris watches wesker as he studies the printed charts
part of an old laundry chute
it might not show on there
it runs up to the kitchen
im not going up
im going down
wesker grim faced looks at his team
id like to let you guys off the hook
but i cant
i need back up
youre comin with me
the troopers exchange glances
jill is first to speak
pg no objections
well back you up
disappointed you said
people wind you up and you do whatever they want you to do
stay out of this son
youre the only one who doesnt have a choice in this
theres no place to lock you up
i cant let you go youre a security risk
i could shoot you
but your lady friend would probably get all over my ass
im afraid youre comin with us
whether you like it or not
to jill pointedly hes your responsibility valentine
see that he doesnt make trouble
jill looks at chris
you up to the challenge
snappy i already have
one by one the members of alpha team wiggle up into the crawl space above the ceiling
chris climbs up behind jill
other troopers are already away following wesker who guides them with the help of his chart
jill starts after them
chris grabs her arm
thought you were gone i
when i saw you
i realized that
that you were still
he pulls her into an embrace
she goes willingly
pg chris cont
come with me
we can get out of here
i want to
when im in this uniform im more than
try to understand
theres no i in team chris
theres no i in dead either
chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her
i should order you to come with me
youd never refuse an order
youre not part of this
im part of it as
long as you are
this is very uncomfortable
barry having overheard is halfway up through the grate
for me too brother
i mean this
indicating the iron thats pressing his belly
its very uncomfortable
chris and jill help barry up into the crawl space
start off after the troop
the camera tracks them
this is gettin old man i swear
i been in this army eighteen years
two away from the big re ti
desk job right
nobody lasts that long if theyve seen action
pg ive seen action in granada
and desert storm
would have lost it all there
if my buddy didnt bring in a team against orders to pull my ass out
youve been with this asshole since
since before that
only an asshole some of the time
up ahead wesker reaches a service ladder
he waves his troop on
they start to climb down
who knows what well find down there
the farther down we go the worse its gonna get
until we hit bottom were in good shape
it sounds like the mgm lion
what the fuck
whatever it is
it cant get us
were in the ceiling
maybe its like
the lead troopers reach another section of the ceiling
clustering around a vent they look down into
the b level lab more streamlined more high tech than the one upstairs
there are large computers linked by metal shielded conduits to jacks in the walls
pg main frame
might have some data we could use
a quick decision fox marini vickers
wesker kicks out the vent
he jumps first through the opening down into the lab
chris watches from behind
the man has balls ill say that
wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent
marini climbs down followed by fox
brad is last
hustle it vickers
youre the guy we need
to cut into the network
wesker looks around
there are three doorways
open wide with only darkness beyond
wesker runs around closing them
watch these entrances guys
fox and marini take up posts
brad lowers himself gingerly
he drops the last two feet onto the desk landing on his bloody leg
he topples falling to the floor but pops up instantly
he limps over and attacks the computer keys
another distant snarl
it doesnt sound like its on this level
at the computer shit
im locked out
any clues for a password
brad types rapidly nervously
just some kind of video feed
its a play back
watching the screen holy shit
we hear it before we see it
the sound of absolute panic
thuds and crashes
then a womans voice
womans voice o
if anyone is receiving this
brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the others to see
the woman is an oriental
shes standing in the foreground as marcus was in the opening video
behind her is a lab we havent seen yet
with white coated figures
the situation is completely
out of control
the woman is pushed out of the way by a man who is trying to protect her from
something that blurs past the lens like a pendulum from above
in the next instant
the lens is coated with blood
as it oozes down we see a partial image of the same man
his head is out of frame at the top of the screen
the thing above must have a hold on it
because the man is dangling his arms witching
his back has three gouges in it long and so deep that they might have been made by piece of heavy machinery
we only see this for an instant
before the man is lifted straight up with amazing speed
wesker clicks off the monitor
the other men instinctively look up above their heads
maybe the ceilings not such a safe place after all
the door behind fox bursts open
before he has time to react a zombie is on him biting his cheek neck shoulder
the two figures fall to the floor grappling
wesker cant get a clean shot
pg marini is first to reach the desk but he helps the limping brad up ahead of him
two more zombies lurch in through the open doorway
wesker shoots them but he sees more
cant tell how many
shambling toward the open doorway from the darkness beyond
wesker focuses on fox who is still being mauled bitten
wesker still has no safe shot
brad is yanked up into ceiling by sullivan and aiken
chris leans out of the opening reaching for marini
wesker kicks the mauling zombie in the head
it takes three hard boots to attract the things attention
when it finally looks up at him wesker blows out its skull
fox is lying on his stomach writhing bleeding profusely from a half dozen bites
wesker stoops down trying to roll him over lift him up
hes gone insane
chris pulls marini up to safety
barry leans down through the opening
haul ass boss
the zombies are heading for wesker
there are three of them
barry shoots at the one in front
his second shot hits the things brain
wesker again tries to hoist fox who this time rolls over on his own
he has drawn his pistol
before wesker can stop him he eats the barrel and blows out the back of his head
one zombie is dangerously close
barry fires two more rounds
no head shot but the zombie staggers and though not dead falls
directly toward wesker
the colonel rolls on his back kicking himself away managing to get clear
he uses his own pistol to blast the zombie
he scrambles to his feet darts toward the desk and jumps up
the third zombie grabs his legs
from above barry risks a dangerous shot
wesker hears the bullet whizzz past his head like a mosquito
the zombie is hit in the skull
there are more of them coming out of the darkness
barry takes hold of wesker and with a single strong arm pulls him up into
the crawl space where wesker breathes heavily for a moment
then looks up at his old friend
two i owe ya
we were all
is not in my vocabulary
a horrible moaning sound comes from below in the lab
three more zombies can be seen clustering around the desk dumbly trying to climb up sensing the food above
wesker takes off
speyer rodriguez aiken and sullivan are quick to follow
the others lag behind when chris says
those things could get up here
we cant let that happen
this is our way out
chris swings his legs through the grate and jumps down
onto the desk
he boots one of the zombies away and tries to leap over the others
one of them catches his foot in mid air
chris isnt hurt but he topples to the floor sprawling losing his winchester
the zombies have him cornered
he crawls toward his rifle
pumps a shell into the firing chamber
aims at the closest of the walking dead
which was once a young man a simple laborer wearing overalls with a name tag
chris looks empathetically into the things dead eyes
can you hear me
the zombie lumbers forward hungrily
can you hear me
pg chris has come late to the realization that these things were once human
now he comes late to the realization
that they are human no longer
the zombie grabs the barrel of the winchester pushing it aside
chris cant bring it back to bear on the monsters head
he blasts a round through the things belly
it has no effect
the zombie reaches for chris throat
starts to lean in to bite him
the things skull explodes
jill has jumped down onto the desk
she fires another accurate pistol round
the second zombie falls
jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk
chris gets to his feet rushing in to help her
together they shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate
how do we get back up
shit if you didnt have a plan you shouldnt have jumped down here
we have a real problem here chris
jill nods toward the open doorway
there are more stuttering figures approaching out of the dark
how big is this place
how many people were down here
with a startling sound a dark shape swing down from above and grabs jill
is it the thing we saw on the video
his mighty arms lift jill
shes caught by aiken and sullivan and pulled up to safety
barry grabs chris and lifts him as well
chris grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up
he reaches back down through the opening
below barry squats
and makes a mighty leap with his muscular legs
chris grabs his arms
and is nearly pulled back down
pg straining big
jill grabs on then sullivan
but one of the zombies has reached barry
it grabs his kicking legs
its teeth snap
the commandos lift barry clear but the zombie ends up with a chunk of something in its mouth
it got you
barry checks his leg
his trousers are torn but
no skin broken
we owe you a pair of pants
they crawl away
the zombies below reach up their fingers clutching at the ceiling but with the desk gone theres no way they can get up
the commandos climb down a steel access ladder into a storage room stacked with crates and cartons
theres only one door
the place seems secure
wesker sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts
gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room
a few light cigarettes
but not speyer
im through wesker
me too man
this aint nothin i signed on for
calm you want to wait here fine
were gettin out
he flashes his access card
not without this
pg fuck you
and your fancy doors and your green key
the choppers have rockets
they can blow out a wall if they have to
im callin em in
speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code
you wanna see a wall blow ill blow all of em for ya
wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and retrieved in the woods
he pulls a long wire out of it with a small sensor on the end
ill put a crater in this forest that takes out racoon city and everything else for twenty miles
he jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button on the belt unit
small red lights blink
its a radio detonator
to set off explosives that are
buried under neath us somewhere
the ultimate containment measure
incinerate the place
smiling again it has a
dead man mechanism
he taps the ear piece
that reads my pulse
my heart stops and
that damn thing can slip out of your ear by accident
its your job
all of your jobs
to see that it doesnt
and to see that my heart
doesnt skip any beats
wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses
at speyer wesker cont
give me the radio soldier
wesker explodes for the first time
this text orginiated from www
com please check us out for resident evil coverage
pg shocked silence
sullivan is the first to speak
sumbitch might do it speyer
iii be obliged to do it
if i dont get that antidote ill have to burn this place out
jill steps over to speyer and takes the radio from him
to jill what are you this guys flunky
he just threatened to blow us all up for christs sake
thats what im trying to prevent
whap whap whap
one huey is in the air
the camera moves in on a window
laguardia is flying his radio man beside him
how many digits did you receive
the beginning of an air support code but
it just went dead on me
the radio man presses his headset to his ear
laguardia looks on apprehensively
radio man cont
into mike yes sir
we got the signal sir
he clicks off he says it was
call washington anyway
i want the authority to take action if necessary
the hand with the ostentatious ring snatches a red telephone receiver from of a desk drawer
man with ring o
once again we dont see his face
just his free hand with another monte cristo burning
holden man with ring cont
this is weskers show
if he was in real trouble wed have lost half of pennsylvania by now
as the hand flicks ash we see a sheet of paper on the desk with a letterhead that bears
an umbrella logo
in the huey the radio man clicks off an incoming call
no independent action
i feel so fuckin
the huey over flies the mansion which from the air looks as stable as the rock of gibraltar
wesker has come down off his rampage
he looks exhausted
he also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his troop
you guys were hand picked
a special unit
most of you have been sitting on your asses drawing pay checks for more than two years
its time to repay those
wesker lifts his automatic
the action wasnt meant as a threat
wesker is just checking his ammo
pg pitch your empties
put all your loaded clips on that crate there
i want a count
then i want the rounds divvied up
the troopers deposit their loaded clips reloading the ones that are half used
checking the maps
god dammit no more jokes
we have men dead upstairs
this hell hole is full of people who died
because of this stinkin
jill has been counting the ammo clips
thats all we have
we werent expecting a war speyer
to jill ill take three
three to your boyfriend
dont need em
got my own loads
weskers eyes dart angrily toward chris
but he notices jill watching him
and he calms himself
we all get four clips
they must have
weapons down here somewhere
a powder magazine
no more side trips
it was a mistake to go into that lab upstairs
and im not makin another one
from now on its straight ahead
in and out
pg wesker stands and opens the door
outside is a service corridor with unfinished walls
spaces between raw metal beams are stuffed with insulation
wesker checks the jamb outside
its got a lock mechanism
not an override
my key wont work here on the way out
prop the door
the troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open
wesker moves out
the commandos trickle after him
chris holds jill behind for a moment
this guy is a loony toon
trying to get the job done
doing what he has to do
i hope youll say the same about me
when i do
what i have to do
chris turns and walks off
jill follows him out into
they catch up with the troop which is clustered at a blind alley which has two doors
checking his map its not clear
which way to go
want me to flip a coin
wesker is annoyed by the remark
decisively he selects one of the doors and uses his green key card
with a bzzzz the lock releases
the troop enters
a vast room fifty by fifty yards
its filled with heaters air conditioners water pumps
main frames for the internal computer network line one wall fuse boxes and switcher panels another
this is the systems center for the entire facility
theres an attendants desk just inside the door
aiken and sullivan drag it over to prop the door open
it makes pg a frightening sound as it scrapes the floor echoing bouncing around in the large space
it prompts a response
another of those animal like snarls from somewhere in the distance
whats that sound like to you
alken a meat eater
there are thick columns floor to ceiling every ten feet
the spaces between them are very dark
its hard to see
wesker and some of the others click on their flashlights
beams cut through dust
there are electronic hums
clicks and chatters emit from the switchers pings from the heaters all combining to fray everyones nerves
light beams dance nervously as the commandos start out across the dark and frightening space
softly to jill this is the heart of the whole place
theyve got to have it
two things happen almost at once
chris notices electric eyes
on all of the columns
a zombie lurches around a corner and bites a chunk out of marinis face
jill whirls around to shoot at the zombie but chris grabs her and flattens her on the floor
marini staggering screaming in pain triggers the first electric eye
laser beams shoot in all directions forming a tight net
chris and jill are barely beneath them
many of the other troopers are hit by the beams
which do no immediate harm
but wherever they make contact small cylinders above the electric eyes begin to hiss
the commandos duck under the laser beams
just in time
jets of steam spout from the cylinders
its not just hot steam
its acidic deadly
marini is hit by it
his clothes ignite
his flesh boils
its a horrible sight but for the moment the jets stop
pg marini is dead on his feet
when he falls he trips another of the laser beams
the steam jets spout again
the troop is beneath them though many are burned by liquid drops that spit from the nozzles
amazingly the zombie has avoided contact
but as it begins to stumble after commandos we realize its going to activate the sensors again
theres no way outta this mousetrap
so we live here now
we gotta run for it
the zombie hits one of the laser beams
the steam hisses out again
the zombie is melted
bad idea speyer
chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor
where do they go
does it matter
sullivan whips out a swiss army knife and goes to work on the screws that hold down one of the panels
other troopers do the same
another zombie lurches out of the darkness
human hands work furiously loosening screws
panels come up troopers begin to duck through the openings
a second zombie hits a red beam
chris and jill are spattered
but jill bravely keeps working with her own issued knife
she gets a panel open
as she drops through a third zombie triggers a burst of steam
chris ducks and covers
when the jets stop chris begins to climb into the opening but one of his legs is grabbed from behind by
one of the dead things which has already been melted
pg its flesh is bubbling
bone is beginning to show
but the acid hasnt reached its brain yet
the creature is still alive
chris cries out
acid from the zombies hands is burning his leg
the things lips have been eaten away making its teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a bite of flesh
chris jams the stock of his winchester into the zombies mouth
hes able to hold the things head back but hes stuck
he cant let go
jill pops up out of the floor
she presses the barrel of her own weapon into the zombies forehead
chris pulls his rifle away
at the same instant jill fires
the zombie is propelled through the air
one of its flailing arms triggers another laser beam
chris throws himself in on top of jill as steam hisses over them
twenty yards away wesker crawls under the cloud of acid
just as he climbs down through one of the openings he feels pressure
on his ear
a groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the wire that runs from the detonator to weskers ear piece
for a breathless moment it seems like the sensor will be popped loose
holding the pulse reader in place wesker twists his body lifts his hand gun and pumps three into the dead things brain
the zombie flops over but its fingers cling entangled in the wire
wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles of the things dead hand
three more shots cut through bone removing the fingers from the hand
the wire is freed
wesker dives into the opening in the floor
the commandos find themselves in an air duct
no room to stand
hardly room to sit
chris looks at his rifle stock
its corroded from the acid in the zombies mouth
and it doesnt even stop them
pg its not meant to stop them
its meant to stop
that distant snarling sound comes again making jill shiver
the troop is strung out along the metal shaft
rebecca crawls among them treating the worst burns
wesker checks his maps
speyer confronts him again
we damn near got turned into rice krispies by that gizmo of yours
if you dont want me to nail that fuckin thing into your ear you deactivate it
so you cant chicken out
the system can only be turned off at the main panel
where the hell is that
where the explosives are
farther than we need to go
we only have to make it down one more level
we make it back up to the choppers
we can fly out of the detonators signal range
chris calls out from the far end of the shaft im not willing to rely on that
i live here this is my town
the towns been evacuated
just in case
that explains the lie
about the plane crash
an airplane down
with weapons on board
would nicely explain a big explosion wouldnt it
you figured all along you might have to blow this place
i dont want to do it
i hope i dont have to
pg chris looks down the dim air shaft unable to see weskers eyes hidden by distance
and by his dark glasses
thats the best i can do for you kid
lets knock on it
wesker moves out
the troop follows
i cant let this happen
ive got to find that bomb
once wesker gets what he wants my obligation is over
chris looks at her with appreciative eyes
i want you out
with the rest of them
wesker wont push the button until youre clear
he doesnt want to push the button
he has to
dont you see
he cant leave these labs here
hes gotta get rid of the evidence
the light is dim at its best
long stretches of the shaft are pitch black and theres a constant stream of air that moans eerily
this whole mission has been like a descent into hell darker and more frightening with each level down
there are turn offs t s and y s
at one point when jill looks back she finds rosie behind her
chris is gone
did he leave to deal with the bomb
no but hes about to
hes at the rear of the pack pressed against the side wall waving others past
ive got to try and stop this
pg jill starts back toward chris but freezes
everyone freezes when
the duct work starts to ping
one thing after another
the air shaft is rocked as if punched by a giant fist
the whole structure begins to shimmy
what is it an earthquake
ride it out
a sheet metal panel buckles
others do the same
all along the shaft panels begin to fold inward
something outside is crushing the duct as if it were a giant tube of toothpaste
and the troopers are being squeezed inside
the panels begin to separate
and large pulsing bits of flesh appear
not animal flesh
but the flesh of a plant
the things that press in through the openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the kitchen
those were its fingertips
these are its arms
strong arms that are ripping the ductwork apart
chris rebecca aiken and sullivan end up in one part of the shaft
the rest in another
including jill who calls out
the section that holds chris group falls away
with a monstrous crunching sound
chris group spills out of the dangling metal with cables from the torn ceiling
sparking around them
the troopers drop out of hell into
an enormous hot house a lush indoor jungle of plants ivies grasses
its like a rain forest complete with a thick damp mist that makes it difficult to see
we might be on another planet
none of the foliage seems indigenous to earth
there are leaves the size of bed sheets flowers the size of armchairs
and at the center of it all is the mother of the deadly vines
plant a monstrous schefflera twenty times normal size
most of its limbs reach upward where they have opened cracks in the ceiling and walls to stretch on into the facility above
there are also dozens of shorter beefier arms each of which act independently like tentacles on an octopus
and each has a large drooling pod at its tip
pg bursts of gunfire from three m s shatter our ears
and a ceiling vent
wesker and the others jump down into
a very unusual corridor
it seems to stretch forever in both directions
it has no doors no visible means of exit or entry
the walls are made up of multi colored polymer tiles whose irregular shapes fit together like a jigsaw puzzle
the floor is heavy steel though faceted
it seem designed to shift
the whole corridor looks like it might be able to bend to change position like an airport jet way
there are disconcerting signs of damage
claw like gouges on the tiles clean cut holes punched through the metal ceiling larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by bullets
and there are smears of blood everywhere as if some terrible battle
took place here
he starts off
chris and the others
if theyre dead theyre dead
if theyre alive theyll still be alive in twenty minutes
when we get back
and how do we know its only going to be twenty minutes
how do we know well be able to come back this way
but well do our damndest to try
this is it guys
the home stretch
wesker trots off
vickers and rodriguez follow
speyer and barry hang back
with jill who remains torn
looking back valentine
youre on the clock
jill wrestles with her emotions but in the end dutifully she falls in
as the troopers move off we hear odd scratching sounds
with the high pitched squeal of metal on metal
pg the beefy arms of plant undulate overhead as chris and his companions look for an exit
th this thing was no accident
it was cultivated
and it didnt rip out the ceiling for the fun of it
the plant seems to behave intelligently with caution
the pods on its arms dart almost as if sniffing
then pull back
like the vines in the kitchen like timid animals
chris spots a doorway
as the others follow him one of the pods swoops down in front of rebecca and doesnt withdraw
it hovers there
its follicles open like jaws which display serrated daggers of cartilage that look like teeth
inside a pulsing calyx emits a pistil that twitches and swells
my mother made me eat vegetables
i know em all
this aint one of em
another pod swoops down on sullivans back
its beak clamps onto the flesh between his shoulder blades
its pistil shoots out like a hypodermic needle stabs him and within the blink of an eye sucks out every ounce of the mans blood
his skin turns the color of parchment flaking off him like powder as he dies
aiken rushes to his buddys side
get out of the away
chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one of the gardens
leaping up he grabs one of the sparking conduits and pulls it down
pg chris cont
get outa there aiken
chris ends up having to shoulder aiken out of the way
tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them but chris manages to jam the semi rigid conduit into a pool of sprinkler fed water around the plants roots
a bright current stutters through every vine
the plant shrieks hideously as electricity causes fluids to squirt from boils that develop on its flesh down along its arms and into its blood sucking pods
which flop lifeless to the floor with the same sort of liquid smacks that human skulls might make
they killed sullivan
whoever did this shit
they killed sullivan
enraged aiken draws a long bladed knife and wildly attacks the remains of plant slashing at the things dead limbs not stopping until he cuts into
something that looks like a vine
but bleeds red
aiken traces the thing with his eyes up to where its coiled in high tree branches
its the oversized body
of a copperhead with a belly six feet in diameter
as aiken gasps spellbound hes stuck from behind
the snake is so long its body is draped on one side of the greenhouse but its head is on the other
with the power of a dozer shovel
jaws like the open hood of a cadillac
teeth the size of windows
clamp onto aikens mid section instantly crushing his ribs
chris finds a skein of rope
he throws the long end over a ceiling beam then instantly makes a lasso out of the piece in is hand and tosses the loop at the snakes head
aikens body in the serpents jaws makes the rope miss
chris throws again
in the seconds between tosses the snake has slurped aiken into its mouth
the rope encircles the beasts head
the noose slips down over the snakes maxillaries and tightens around its neck
chris uses all his strength
with the ceiling beam as a pulley the snakes head is slammed against the rafters
to rebecca hold this
rebecca is understandably not quick to respond
pg chris cont
in this crisis chris finds himself sounding a lot like wesker
it sobers him
it sobers rebecca as well
she rushes in and takes hold of the rope
moving fast chris rushes to where aikens knife dropped on the floor
he grabs it turns back and sees
something moving inside the snakes beaded torso
chris charges plunges the knife into the beast hacking through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody cavity
aiken is curled within like jonah in the whale
his chest has been crushed to half its normal size
acids from the monsters intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands his face but hes still conscious able to wheeze out words
k kill me
s sullvan said
better off dead
aint never been truer than now
the snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the ceiling
rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope but shes lifted bodily off the floor
the rope snaps cut by the steel beam
the trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris
it delays the snake for two seconds
those fragile seconds give chris just enough time to reach into the open belly of the monster
and pull the pins on two grenades that dangle from aikens vest
the giant copperhead snaps at chris from behind missing him by inches
he dives like a wide receiver reaching for a pass
what he catches is
his momentum carries her down to the floor
they roll behind another stone wall that contains tons of earth which protects them from
the explosions of the grenades
which blow aiken
and yards of the snakes mid section
the same nervous hands that we saw in the opening fidget on the polished surface of the conference table
a distorted voice scratches over a speaker phone
pg voice on the phone o
filter were close
i think ill be able to get the package
anything you cant handle
voice on the phone o
filter chuckling theres nothing i cant handle
a hand with an ostentatious ring flicks cigar ash
keep us appraised
holdens hand clicks off the speaker phone
to the others in the room im reassured gentlemen
that every thing is
wesker alone in the strange faceted corridor packs away his radio
where are the others
right behind me
talking to someone
theyre your superiors too valentine
dont forget that
should she challenge wesker
she has no time to think
more footsteps come clacking at her back
its rodriguez and speyer
a moment later barry and vickers appear from the opposite direction
we hit a dead end
were never gonna get to that lab
pg tchung tchung tchung
a sound like a rivet gun resounds in the corridor repetitive but random not rhythmic
chris and rebecca are crawling through a two foot high feeder passage for electric cables their bellies scraping the floor their backs the ceiling
they hear the sound
tchung tchung tchung
crying quietly i
cant take this any more
we take what comes
thats the secret of our genius
he looks back
how old are you
not very old at all
not nearly old enough to
none of us is old enough for that
rebecca nods forcing a smile meant to be appreciative
you were nice
she never told me
that sound returns
tchung tchung tchung
down in the corridor the other troopers see
faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark
agile shapes advancing
not along the floor but along the ceiling
they look like apes swinging from
what could they be swinging from
the ceiling is solid metal
close on a monstrous hand both hairy and scaly
its fingers have ten inch claws
more like horns
which punch upward penetrating the ceiling metal and clamping on
pg the shot widens to reveal a beast unlike any weve seen dangling from the ceiling
it is ape like
and lizard like
with ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect like carapace
this thing is an amalgam of all the nasty creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares
there are six of them
as far as we can see there might be more coming from behind
their three toed feet also have claws that can pierce the ceiling enabling them to move forward
hand over foot foot over hand
one of them lets out a grrrowllll
the same sound weve been hearing through the walls
now it echos in the corridor up close and personal
the troopers open fire even before the creatures get in range
chris and rebecca hear the gunfire
chris crawls on
rebecca is stopped when
one of the hunters claws punches up through the floor almost stabbing her
in the tight space chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand
more claws penetrate the metal
the couple plunge ahead of them the way chris plunged ahead of the bullets on level a
wesker jill and the others spit lead at the advancing creatures
bullets thunk into their bodies
blood flows but the creatures seem to feel no pain
even when theyre hit squarely in their skulls
aint doin nothin
that was the idea
the idea was
pg jill aims at one of the hunters pressing the trigger of her m and not letting go until her clip runs out
the creatures head is turned ragged by the barrage
revealing an iron superstructure beneath the skin
is a metal head
jill looks up
chris jumps out of the open grate in the ceiling
rebecca jumps down after him
what dya think
should i wait for orders or just wing it
that just might be the ticket
wing the fuckers
chris takes a careful shot with his winchester
he hits one of the hunters squarely on its wrist
the creature drops to the floor
forget the head shots
shoot for the joints
rebecca opens fire with aikens m giving the others time to reload
barry is the first to resume firing
at the closest of the hunters
at its wrists which are snapped by the bullets
the creature drops to the floor
the troopers fire at knees ankles elbows which seem to be the weakest spots
more of the hunters drop from the ceiling
but they continue to advance crawling pushing themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact
we slowed em down
as far as well get either way is a cement wall
there are two hunters left on the ceiling
one of them makes a mighty impossible lunge
and hits speyer like a battering ram slashing his chest open with its claws
two of the hunters on the floor rush forward not attacking but wanting to feed on speyers remains
pg brad trembling completely crazed drops his weapon and backs away
one of those jigsaw tiles a red one glow from within
he thinks hes hallucinating until
the floor jerks in a tight spasm
its steel facets begin to separate sliding away from each other
the troopers narrowly escape as
the floor behind them grinds in and out left and right as if it were chewing
speyers body and those of the hunters on the floor are eaten by the powerful steel blades
but one hunter remains above it all
tchung tchung tchung it continues to advance along the ceiling
an invisible jigsawed door glides open twenty yards down the hall
the troopers run for it and are met by a beautiful asian scientist
the woman we saw on the video playback
you lost a man
if i had only been faster
i was unfamiliar with the mechanism
the hunter approaches
one of them
the troopers rush into
a security cubicle
chris is the last to enter barely making it before the door begins to slide shut
claws penetrate the opening
dont worry its mindless
it doesnt realize that its strong enough to push the door open
sometimes the dumb get lucky
hasnt happened to me yet
the hunter growls
its snout darkens the space between door and wall
mucous from its nostrils spits through
pg after a terrifying moment the claw recedes
the dark snout disappears
the snorting fades away
followed by a distant
tchung tchung tchung
as the hunter departs
everyone relaxes visibly
the troopers turn and for the first time notice two haggard scientists standing across the room
as far as we know we are the
we worked on c level
one of the biologists saved us
brought us down here
he knew that
he didnt have long to live
started the mechanism
out there in the corridor
and he let it
ada stares at a complicated control panel
i only saw it used that one time
i could have been faster
you did fine lady
as are we
sighing we believed
we would die here
the bomb would destroy us
about the bomb
the end for a place like this when it fails
must be a bomb yes
jill looks at chris
his point has been proven
that you are here
the bomb will not come
we brought it
the colonel here
hes wearing it
ada looks at the detonator on weskers belt at the sequence of blinking lights
to wesker is it true
are you here to
with that odd smile of his if i have to pick only one
ill pick destroy
youre not s
still smiling two salaries
three if you count combat pay
ada looks at him with disgust
the man i loved john marcus
developed the organism that caused all this
he did it for humanitarian purposes
it was taken away from him
for in human purposes
by men like you
men like me
are just errand boys
sent in to do the wet work
all of the glory
none of the benefits
after what youve seen down here do you think any of it could be turned into
i think it could be turned into five or ten million dollars
how do we get into d lab
she slumps john was killed
never even knowing it existed
they kept him
isolated upstairs while a separate team was down here
corrupting his research
using it to build b
pg bio organic weapons
its behavior remained reptilian
all they could ever get it to do was
grow in size
they were weapons
simply became infected
people who believed they were serving their flag
turned into mindless
before the outbreak the experiments went further didnt they
ceiling crawlers out there
the product of human dna spliced with the dna of vicious carnivores
animals even insects
plated with armor beneath newly cultivated skin
injected with poison so their biological components would die
the t virus reactivates them in a matter of minutes but
in battle lost minutes are
so the b
s had to die
and be allowed to revive before they could be used to
they were murdered
by their own people
so they could never be murdered again
by the enemy
pg were any more of these
ada is about to answer but wesker interrupts
ada glances at an innocuous wall panel
wesker notices a key slot
it cant be opened
none of us is cleared for that level of security
that i am
wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into the slot
the panel slides open
beyond it is a steel door with another green slot
wesker uses his card again
a lock clicks
wesker pushes the door open
come with me
the rest of you
make sure this door doesnt close
wesker taps his ear piece
everyone gets his meaning
he and barry disappear through the opening
the steel door begins to close
rodriguez lunges and catches it
you been leaving doors open
this place is going to be overrun by
brads in really bad shape
brad is leaning against a wall sweating shivering
rebecca looks at his wounded leg
thats not just a scrape
you were bitten werent you
of the sharks
brushed up against its teeth
after it was dead
alert shoot him
somebody shoot him
were so close
wesker and barry trot down a flight of metal stairs
whats got into you man
this isnt like you
oh yes this is exactly like me
until now wesker has been steadfast
he suddenly seems nervous anxious
some of it is fear
most of it is anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach
what ive been all my life
suckin up to the honchos
wipin the shit off their asses
all the while lookin for a break
a way to get some of my own
well this it friend
im myself alright
and i know exactly what im doing
i told you
before this day was over
id pay you back
chris and jill step past rodriguez
they take off down the stairs
as they leave ada opens a desk drawer and pulls out a
looking at the gun you know how to use that thing chica
of course i do
im a scientist
pg ada clicks back the bolt whips up the
and aims it at brads head
rebecca dives in front of the man
not while theres still a chance to save him
wesker and barry arrive at a set of plexiglass doors
they cant see through them theyre fogged
wesker finds a key slot inserts his access card and
the doors open
a cloud of hyper cold mist rushes out instantly coating the men in frost
wesker doesnt feel the cold
he doesnt feel anything except a surge of triumph
he steps through the opening into
a laboratory that looks like the cockpit of a concorde
only a hundred times larger
nothing is recognizable except desks that hold futuristic ibokin computers
a befuddling array of buttons switches stuttering lights covers every inch of wall space
and at the center of it all stands a tall cylindrical tank a stasis tube filled with ice
its mounted on a six foot tall platform like an altar with cables and flexible tubes running out of it
wesker squints and through the freeze sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder
its nine feet tall
like the hunters it has more or less human form though its musculature is more defined than supermans
one of its arms is scaled to size but the other is much longer
its hand dangles at knee level
monstrous steel claws depend from its fingers nearly touching the floor
in awe its called
nobody knows it exists
umbrellas man in d
we need him
he signs the checks
excited weve got it barry
pg youre not gonna try to get this big mother outta here
dont have to
all we need is the data
these things can be cranked out on an assembly line
laying down his automatic wesker hits computer keys until a disk pops out of a master feed
this is it
what about the antidote
laughing there is no antidote
that was just happy horse shit to keep the team going
neither man notices
that the removal of the master disk has caused certain systems to fail
indicated by red lights and by the fact that
the walls of the tyrants cylinder are beginning to run liquid sweat
youre gonna give this to umbrella
im gonna sell it to them
then im gonna open a swiss bank account
right next to yours
jill has appeared in the doorway with chris
they both at the monster with awe
cant be real
its real alright
and its worth
more than gold
more than uranium
do we get a piece of that action
rosie has arrived
so have rebecca ada and the two surviving scientists
pg all of you do
anyone who comes out of this alive
gets a taste
i been eatin shit all my life
im happy to eat some more
as long as its got some gravy on it
rosie steps into the lab her weapon ready
anybody else see it my way
one of the scientists toshiro rushes to join
to toshiro you disgrace yourself
i want to live
jill looks at chris
then she steps through the doorway and takes a defensive post beside her c
and i was gonna try to disarm the bomb
this place should be destroyed
it needs to be destroyed
chris lifts his rifle
wesker is faster with his pistol aiming it at chris belly
its only because of valentine here that i didnt squeeze the trigger
chris and jill exchange dagger eyes
if shes on your side
she doesnt mean shit to me
and i dont mean shit to her
one way to go here
pg yes sir
jill presses in close to wesker as if completely allied
cant yell you chris
how much i wanted
things to have turned out differently
swiftly unexpectedly jill snatches the detonator wire and pulls the sensor out of weskers ear
everyone shuts their eyes expecting to be blown sky high
jill pulls the detonator off weskers belt
she stares small led screen which reads
i got all my courage up
and we still have fifteen minutes
jill tosses the detonator to chris
wesker turns on her lifting his m
i shoot boss
wesker turns to find barrys weapon aiming at his belly
here i am still callin you boss
wesker is holding the data disk
suddenly he feels it snatched away
by ada who has rushed into the room
he aims his weapon at her back as she darts away
before he can fire hes kicked in the head
buckling dazed he looks up at her
we believed in you
i believed in you
boy was i a sucker
she kicks him again just for the hell of it
he flops on the floor his eye socket swollen
hes dropped his gun
he gropes for it
barry steps in and boots it away
a klaxon sounds
the ice in the tyrants tank has melted down to a critical level
is beginning to move
pg reaching the doorway ada hears a mechanism trip in the jamb
the plexiglas doors begin to slide shut
ada strains to hold them back
or you never will
well live here
glancing at the tyrant no
the landlord looks like a sonuvabitch
rosie rushes in to help ada hold the doors
so does benjamin the second of the surviving scientists who is
mauled from behind by a zombie
its not just any zombie
its brad vickers back from death who bites out the artery in benjamins neck
ada lifts her
and blows vickers way
she looks down at benjamin writhing on the floor aims at his head
and fires again
rodriguez is the only one holding the doors
jill rushes to help her
off the led thirteen minutes
inside the lab barry turns to toshiro the other scientist
a second too long
the stasis tube bursts open
water and bits of ice fly out
along with an enormous bionic hand
big enough to grab toshiros head as if it were a cantaloupe
powerful enough to crush that head as if it were
well a cantaloupe
wesker still searching for his pistol sees all this
the tyrant is not completely free
much of the cylinder wall has cracked away but sections of it cling to a now misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound
though it won t for much longer
wesker starts toward the door
barry grabs the back of his shirt and pitches him across the lab
pg barry cont
you and me
we aint goin nowhere
not just now boss
barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway
this thing gets loose its gonna be pissed
somebodys gotta hold it back
give you guys a fair chance
wesker has found his pistol
he fires at barry who ducking is only grazed
wesker aims at the group in the doorway
barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him
ada and rebecca duck away from the doors pulling rodriguez and a reluctant jill after them
the doors begin to slide closed
chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting
wesker crawls lke a dog
he manages to fling an arm out through the opening
steel bumpers press on the meat of his forearm
wesker looks up
through the plexiglas his eyes meet chris
get me outta here redfield
or so help me god youre a dead man
with his free hand wesker aims his pistol at chris
the gun barrel is an intimidating sight even though its on the other side of the plexi
chris glances at the others
ada rebecca and rodriguez wrestle jill away bodily and start up the metal stairway
orders dont mean shit any more wesker
especially when they come from sell out bastards like you
pg chris lets go
the doors squeeze tighter
through the plexi chris catches a glimpse of barry who stands and gives him a military salute
chris salutes back
blam blam blam
wesker fires three rounds
dusty blemishes appear on the bulletproof glass
the slugs ricochet back into the lab
one of them chips away at the ice which is less and less able to contain the tyrant
chris makes a break for the stairs
wesker twists his body in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening but his fist around the stock is too thick
nonetheless wesker fires
blam blam blam
bullets scream off the banister rails but none of them contact chris legs which disappear up the stairs
the ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush
the tyrant is about to break loose
wesker looks pleadingly at barry
you gotta get us out
not sure i know how boss
is there some other
need to know secret for shutting down the big bopper here
it cant be shut down
the ultimate warrior
the ultimate soldier
how it does against a couple of hard ass career guys like you and me
wesker swings his free arm and aims his pistol at barry
the gun is empty
the escapees arrive in the security cubicle
the corridor outside
can be moved
ada rushes over to the instrument panel
her hands go to work on an array of buttons and switches
pg the multi faceted corridor twists into a new configuration with the rumble of an eight on the richter
you wont come out in the same place
but youll find a freight loader that can be accessed with
a blue key
pot blue or green
ada pulls a red key from under her lab coat snaps the chain on her neck and holds it out to chris
i took it from an umbrella agent assigned to us here
like all the rest
you could have unlocked d lab
i was hoping it would never be un locked again
i will see that this
she holds up the data disk
chris grabs adas arm and holds it tight while he wrenches the disk away from her
he folds it over onto itself drops it to the floor and pumps three winchester rounds into it
its worthless but youre not
i helped develop it
they lied to you
they lied to marcus
they made you believe you were doing a good thing when it wasnt good at all
it was evil
ada looks deeply into chris eyes
the kind of evil that
resides in all of us
the kind of evil that will
wipe us out in the end
unless we stand up against it
against powers that have
ruled the world since before we were born
we will only be
or locked away someplace else
id rather die here
knowing that the virus has died with me
jill takes a step toward ada
what if its already spread
youre the only one
who knew anything about it
the thought penetrating but i
know so little
more than anyone else
to a higher command
she and chris touch eyes again this time with understanding
the tyrant flexes its monumental muscles
the ice around it cracks
the giant heart dangling outside its chest pumps rapidly
sending fluids through exposed synthetic veins that run to the creatures brain
thats one helluva big pump
pg an implant
a fuckin elephant
i figured you knew more than you were telling
barry fires at the encased organ
his bullets bounce off the shielding with no effect
how do we kill this thing
i told you we dont
w we cant
more ice pops off the monsters pectorals
close on adas face
i dont know if i can face this
she and the escapees are no longer in the cubicle
theyre in the runway
just get us upstairs
ill take care of it from there
with a sigh come
they break out at the run klacking along the faceted steel floor of the movable
and still moving
theyre nearly knocked off their feet when the system suddenly stops dead
ada slams her fist into one of those jigsaw tiles on the wall
another red one which glows from within
a panel grinds open revealing
pg a more natural looking corridor
half way along there are steel prongs that protrude from a wall
the group starts toward them
but stops when a soul shriveling sound fills the passageway
the hungry moaning of things that are dead
were left open
the tyrant breaks free of the last bit of restricting ice
whimpering he gropes with his hand thats outside the plexiglas doors
he grabs something
brad vickers boot
wesker tugs on it
barry opens fire on the tyrant full bore with his m
the stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster notice the big man
the escapees run down the corridor
shapes appear at the far end
the walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs crawling over each other hungry for living flesh
the humans reach the freight loader
prongs like those on a fork lift extend from a heavy chain drive that runs up and down through openings in the floor and ceiling
ada swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button
the chain drive grinds upward hoisting the prongs
ada pushes rebecca onto the next set of prongs that come up out of the floor
the footing is precarious
rebecca has to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted
the lift moves slowly eight feet separating each set of prongs
the ghouls continue to press in
i dont know if its gonna happen
i been waitin all day for somthin
pg rosie opens fire
chris and jill follow suit as ada steps onto the next set of prongs
front ranks drop
zombies from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them
the corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies pushing inexorably forward
rosie teeth gritted keeps firing while chris forces jill onto the next set of prongs
as she rises she hands her m to chris
he slings it on his arm while levering his old winchester making each of his shots count until the next set of prongs rises out of the floor
to rosie youre up
im havin too much fun
you got a lady
i just got me
i aint gonna die in this rat hole
ill make it
get outta here
chris hands jills rifle to rosie who fires with both hands as chris jumps onto the lift
zombies are mowed down
but more come
the syringe keeps pressing
the next prongs rise
rosie steps on still blasting
the first zombies reach her
shooting down she blows them away
but more come grabbing her legs grabbing the chains rocking the prongs
rosie nearly falls
she drops one of the rifles in order to hold on
she carefully picks off the most threatening zombies
miraculously she rises out of their reach and into
a very tight very dark space with sheet metal walls that have been bruised by loads of freight
the rumble of the chain drive echoes frighteningly
above rosie the others rise slowly
feeling apprehensive vulnerable
rebecca at the top looks up and sees light spilling through an opening through which she is about to pass
calling up to her level c
have your weapons ready
from below whoop de doo
pg rebeccas eyes rise above the floor of level c
all seems quiet
but who knows what might be lurking
the tyrant still a bit sluggish steps down from the platform that supported its tank
barry jams in a fresh clip and keeps firing at the thing
the tyrant impervious stalks after the big trooper
wesker is still on the floor his arm through the doors tugging on vickers boot
the flesh on weskers forearm is peeled by the bumpers as he uses all his strength to drag vickers body closer
until the boot winds up in the opening preventing the doors from closing
wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free
he rushes to a computer console and types a request for the t virus
get under a desk man
im gonna feed this thing a pineapple
barry pulls a grenade from his belt
it might damage the system
ive got to get this data
weskers m has been lying where he left it on the console
he picks it up
bullets dont work
barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when wesker triggers off a burst
into barrys gut
they seem to work just fine
barry is blasted across the lab
the tyrant makes its first quick move
making us appreciate how fast and powerful it really is
it swipes at barrys body as it flies through the air catching it in its steel claw
we hears bones snap as barry goes limp
take a little lunch break mr
i just need a few more seconds
pg the tyrant lifts barrys body as if it were as light as a feather up to its snout
recognizing that the man is dead the monster flings him aside like so much garbage
and begins to lumber toward wesker
to the computer come on come on
a monitor reads complete
wesker rests a finger on the button to eject a floppy
the tyrant is getting closer by the second
wesker fires a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat
wesker ejects the floppy jams it into his flack jacket and firing another burst runs for the door
the tyrant has to move around desks and computer consoles to catch him
wesker shoves his m through the space thats being held open by vickers boot
he begins to pry the opening wider
a warning buzzer goes off
the tyrant dimly registers the sound
its eyes dilate like camera shutters with a cli click
it strides forward at top peed pitching desks easily aside smashing through a console as if it were made of balsa
wesker has pried the doors wide
the tyrant is coming at him fast
its going to be very close
wesker makes it
he gets outside
the doors begin to glide shut
the tyrants long bionic claws shoot with the speed of switch blades through the opening just before the doors meet
four of the claws skewer wesker passing clean through him
he doesnt die instantly
hes still alive and screaming when the tyrant uses the same hand with wesker impaled on it to push the doors open wide again
the action causes weskers head to be sliced off by one of the steel bumpers
the tyrant steps out of the lab
as the doors glide shut the monster holds the remainder of weskers body inside their path
the bumpers are stopped by the tyrants iron hand
which it extracts letting the doors scrape the dead meat from its claws
pg rebecca is approaching another opening
the corridor on level b is long and narrow with only occasional pools of light from bare overhanging bulbs
rebecca rises like a spirit out of the floor
she lifts her weapon
her eyes dart looking for dangers
there are none
the corridor while very spooky is quiet
dont see anything
rebecca rises through the ceiling
were almost there
youll have to jump off
the belt wont stop
as the echo of adas voice rings off rebecca looks up and
something dives down on her out of the darkness
she ducks almost losing her balance
she clings to the chain as other things
black relatively small
whip past her head
there are bats in here
dont let them bite you
rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past her
looking up she sees more coming
she aims her m and fires up the shaft
two birds are hit
one hits ada
she swats it aside
it drops all the way down to rosie who jumps gasping when it hits her
pg beneath her rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from level b
they circle then start to fly up again
rosie opens fire filling the shaft with ribbons of lead
another bird dives from above and
takes a chunk out of rosies cheek
from above you alright
rosie keeps firing
the deafening sound of her m keeps her from hearing a
in the sheet metal wall
a second later
the metal is torn open like tissue paper
something dark lunges from the opening
its the surviving hunter
one of its steel claws grabs the chain drive
the mechanism stops dead
quick cuts of the escapees slipping nearly falling as they hang on to the chain
i thought it wasnt supposed to stop
rebecca has nearly reached level a
shes able to hoist herself up and roll to safety
ada tries to climb
the chain is greasy
her hands slip
below the hunter lets go of the mechanism
the chain jerks
the escapees nearly lose their balance again
rosie at the bottom is being lifted toward the hunters free hand
she jumps down
barely catching the next set of prongs beneath her
at the top ada reaches level a
rebecca catches her and pulls her up onto level a
jill is next rising slowly
rebecca and ada reach down and grab her arms just as
the mechanism stops again
the hunter has grabbed the chain again
its free hand swings clutching at rosie who crouches avoiding capture
pg jill is pulled to safety
she turns and reaches down for chris who starts to climb the chain his hands slipping on the grease
shes not alright
she cant get up past the hunter
she fires at the thing
bullets bounce off its protective steel under hide
chris climbs three feet
slides back two
the others reach down from above
their hands come within inches but cant quite catch hold of him
you fuckin cockroach here
straining to reach rosie the hunter lets go of the chain for a second then latches on again
that second lifts chris to within reach of jill and the others
they grab his arms
lift him up
that second has also brought rosie within reach of the hunter
its claws comb her hair as she tries to duck lower while keeping her balance on the prongs
something crashes through the wall
a monstrous claw that impales the hunter
its the claw of the tyrant
the chain mechanism begins to rise again
rosie cringing is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught
disappointed the tyrant scrapes the hunter off its claw
it drops away down the shaft
the tyrant turns its clicking dilating eyes up at rosie and
purposely stops the rising chain
calling up bad news guys
this from above climb rosie
i live here now
pg rosie dives off the prongs
directly at the tyrant
with another lightning move the monster catches her in its bionic claw crushing her ribs
with blood spurting from her mouth she utters her last words
ada is the most pragmatic
you convinced me that there were
were at the top
you said youd get us out
adas words snap chris back into the urgency of their situation
he struggles to his feet
th this way
they are in the mansion which chris knows well
he leads his small troop into
a small powder room decorated garishly in an east indian motif
a ceramic tigers head sits atop a vanity
chris grabs it
and twists it on a pivot
a panel spins
the commode disappears into the wall opening a secret passage
hell of a shit house
the guy was a bootlegger
with a sense of humor
chris leads the other into
a small blank chamber
the only thing it holds is a pg i hope they havent disabled this
chris opens the door that covers the clock face
he quickly spins the hands until they hit
a wall begins to grind open straining against rust dirt from years of idleness
cobwebs are pulled apart and
we made it
chris urges the others out through the opening
at the same time he checks the detonator
the led is down to six minutes and counting
at the controls of his helicopter laguardia spots something
rebecca then ada then jill climbing onto the lawn
im goin in
you dont have authority
chris climbs out of the secret exit
the others having spotted the incoming chopper are waving at it
theres a sense of relief of salvation
only chris notices
a bit of plaster falling away from one of the mansions stone walls
the tyrant bursts through the wall
with superhuman speed it attacks the escapees who run dodge barely escaping the whishing swipe of its iron claw
pg what in gods name is that thing
somethin we werent supposed to see
drop the ladder
and drop the stinger
the huey swoops down as low as safety will allow
a faceted aluminum ladder unfurls
chris pushes jill toward the ladder
she pulls on adas arm and sends her up first
ada begins to climb
the tyrant closes in swiping at chris who just manages to avoid the slice of its mighty claw
the radio man leans out of the door above holding something
chris doesnt hear
toss it to me
the radio man drops the stinger
a rocket with a shoulder launcher
down into jills hands
chris hits the dirt
the tyrant tries to crush him by stepping on him
chris rolls away
the ladder is too wobbly
jill cant be sure of launching an accurate shot
chris looks up
sees jill holding the rocket launcher
he runs past the tyrant okey doking left right then dodging left again
the monster swipes at him with its elongated claw
chris flack jacket is caught
protective fibers fly
but chris escapes without injury
pg jill pitches the weapon
chris catches it
the tyrant is on him about to stomp him with a bionic foot when
chris aims at the monsters rhinoceros heart and fires
the rocket connects on target
the casing around the animal heart explodes
and the tyrant drops like a giant redwood
on top of chriss legs
as chris tries to free himself he checks the detonator
laguardia drops his chopper a bit lower
the bottom of the ladder hits the ground coming within chris reach
he grabs on
the helicopter rises again
chris is pulled out from under the tyrants steel body and is lifted into the air
he climbs frantically
above him jill is still on the ladder as well
ada and rebecca pull her up
chris dangles as the huey banks away over the forest
the tops of trees whip his legs but he hangs on climbing up
until the others catch his hands and hoist him into the chopper
chris checks the led
reading over chris shoulder we have to get out of range
to the pilot circle around
are there more survivors
i want to
take a last look
the huey banks into a circle
chris looks down at
and just over the hills
chris looks at her with a resigned smile
pg i hoped
it would be our home
were gonna be moving
chris checks the led
thirty eight seconds
to the pilot full throttle
out of here man
laguardia pushes his stick
the huey lunges forward at top speed
rebecca ada and jill are pressed back by inertia
chris holds himself erect
through the window in the receding sky he spots
an eagle riding the wind
the ground erupts from an enormous under ground explosion
the mansion is reduced to particulate as the shock wave spreads outward
chris farm hand rake is shambling out of the house a zombie
when the explosive force hits tearing him apart
the town is empty
except for nine lonely figures lumbering down main street
the hot wave hits
two are vaporized
fire engulfs two more
the brains of two others are destroyed by flying debris
which catches the remaining three as well
arms are torn off
iron shafts from shattered plumbing shards of window glass slats from picket fences
punch through necks chests bellies
but the dead things their skulls undamaged through billows of dust
