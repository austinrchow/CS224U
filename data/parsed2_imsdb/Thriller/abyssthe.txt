b if window
href b b the abyss by james cameron august directors revision blue deep and featureless the twilight of five hundred feet down
materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an ohio class ssbn ballistic missile submarine
in the attack center darkened to womb red the crews faces shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments
the skipper and his exec crowd around barnes the sonarman
no way barnes
the reds dont have anything that fast
checked it twice skipper
its a real unique signature
no cavitation no reactor noise
doesnt even sound like screws
he puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to the intruders acoustic signature a strange thrumming
the captain studies the electronic position board a graphic representation of the contours of the steep walled canyon a symbol for the montana and converging with it an amorphous trace
representing the bogey
what the hell is it
ill tell you what its not its not one of ours
contact changing heading to two one four diving
speed eighty knots
still diving depth nine hundred feet
port clearance to cliff wall one hundred fifty feet
simultaneously still diving depth nine hundred feet
port clearance to cliff wall one hundred fifty feet
tension builds in the attack room as the montana surges to intercept the intruder
the exec tensely watches the vector graphic readout for the side scan sonar array
the sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls
low to captain its getting tight in here
we can still give him a haircut
helm come right to oh six niner down five degrees
coming right to oh six niner sir
down five degrees
port side clearance one hundred twenty feet narrowing to seventy five
sir we have a proximity warning light
thats too damn close
weve gotta back off
range to contact two hundred
contact junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to
one hundred thirty knots sir
really freaked now nothing goes one thirty
suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness
we see only the effect not the source as a large diffuse light passes rapidly under the subs hull
moments later a shockwave like an underwater sonic boom impacts the sub slamming it sideways
the bride crew are knocked off their feet as the ship is buffeted
were in its wake
everyone shouting at once
the power flickers low
helm all stop
full right rudder
full right rudder
planes are not responding sir
power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side scan display
as the sheer cliff wall loom before them
hydraulics restored sir
the cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with nightmarish slow motion
the sub slams into it with horrific force scraping along and bouncing off
one tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw prangs the wall with an earsplitting k k kwang
with the outer tube doors torn off seawater slams in busting the inner hatches
two foot thick columns of water like fire hoses of the gods blast into the room
everything vanishes instantly in white spray
everyone is hurled off his feet
the planesman flights to recover control of the yoke
lighten her up charlie
the torpedo room is flooded sir
blow all tanks
passing twelve hundred feet
blowing main tanks
twelve hundred fifty feet
the great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for hell
the command crew fights futility for control everyone shouting and terrified
main forward tanks ruptured
passing thirteen hundred feet
too deep to pump auxiliaries
all back full
all back full
answering all back full
passing thirteen hundred fifty feet
the captain locks eyes with the exec amid the din
were losing her
launch the buoy
the exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button
a red light comes on
the captains takes a deep breath
a tiny transmitter is ejected from the subs hell and begins its long ascent to the surface
a second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a ledge tearing open its pressure hull
various quick cuts just flashes and impressions as
seawater blasts down the corridors explodes across the control room hurling men like dolls floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds bursts through hatches into the reactor room blasts men
out of frame in a micro second
in the cobalt twilight we see the montana slide down the sea cliff its hull screeching like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur
descending in an avalanche of silt it finally disappears into the blackness below
a blackness which continues almost straight down feet to the bottom of the cayman trough
above in the world the caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky
the montanas emergency buoy pops to the surface transmitting
long lens shot three massive navy sea king helicopters thundering straight at us filling frame
reverse as they barrel over camera toward a lone civilian ship
an ugly but very sophisticated deep sea drilling support ship the benthic explorer
it is a twin hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck around which crouch enormous cranes winches and other arcane equipment
the first sea king settles onto the helipad disgorging a contingent of naval officers technicians and a squad of armed seamen
a pantomime in the rotorwash we see the benthic petroleum company man kirkhill greeting commodore demarco the on scene commander
the bridge is state of the art with computers and sophisticated navigation and communications gear looking like mission control with its bank of video monitors
the drilling operations supervisor leland mcbride and bendix the crew chief watch the invaders swarming the deck below
does not look good at all
tight on video screen minutes later showing divers working in total blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean
they move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion looking like space suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses
no light from the surface
how deep are they
seventeen hundred feet
wider showing the navy contingent crowding the control room
demarco is hardcore military brusque and efficient
kirkhill is a small man with pinched features wearing a shirt and tie which on a drill ship means company man and or dickhead
i need them to go to over two thousand
they can do it
to mcbride get brigman on the line
a submersible oil drilling platform deepcore ii an island of light in the vast blackness
its main framework connects two tri modules consisting of three cylinders each
these contain living and work areas in a pressurized environment
an umbilical cable thick as a mans thigh runs up from the oil rig into the darkness to the benthic explorer at the surface
in a bubble like dome port window we see the rig foreman or toolpusher bud brigman
hes talking via headset with two divers working outside
catfish de vries and lew bird dog finler
hey you guys are milking that job
kentucky drawl thats cause we love freezin our butts off out here sooo much boss
bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor
the working heart of the rig
thunderous mechanical roar
the drill crew in hardhats and mud plastered overalls tend the massive spinning turn table in the center of the chamber
the semi automated system requires only five men to operate
the others are lupton mcwhirter dwight perry jammer willis and tommy ray dietz
bud hears his names called above the din by jammer a massive roughneck diver who stands a good head taller than the rest
hippys on the bitch box
its a call from topside
that new company man
that guy doesnt know his butt from a rathole
one of the roustabouts a wiry texan turns to him
do me a favor and square away the mud hose and those cable slings
this place is starting to look like my apartment
perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully
bud exits ducking his head through a low watertight hatch
bud tromps down the narrow corridor his work boots gonging on steel
keep your pantyhose on
he enters his office a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork dust gathering tech manuals and waterstained penthouse fold outs
he picks up the phone
punches down a line
whats going on
pause i am calm
im a calm person
is there some reason why i shouldnt be calm
hold on buds expression darkening as he listens
the control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a winnebago packed with instrumentation
at the end is a small bay with multiple viewports
outside at a christmas tree pipe installation a lone diver can be seen welding
he is accompanied by a large submersible flatbed and by a remotely operated vehicle or rov call little geek
little geek is an underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable like control tether
it has a single video eye in front by which the operator pilots the little machine
the rigs rov pilots is allen hippy carnes who stands by the window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee
his pet white rat beany crawls contentedly around his shoulders
the door bangs open
hippy jumps slops his coffee
bud strides in
son of a bitch
he kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked diver recall
a siren blasting through the water from a big hydrophone loudspeaker
drop what youre doing
everybody out of the pool
flatbeds pilot lisa one night standing can be clearly seen behind a bubble canopy
she is a no nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the business
she controls a hydraulic manipulator arm assisting the diver arliss sonny dawson in his work
little geek hovers around them like a tiny helicopter
one night moves the flatbed arm to sonny and hands him the pipe
here you go hon
just in time sugar
they react to buds recall looking toward him up in the control module
dammit we just got out here
there was a time when i would have asked why
one night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw which he narrowly avoids
flatbed moves underneath the rig a few feet above the seafloor with sonny riding on its top deck
it passes under a lit opening and rises toward the surface of the water in the chamber above
little geek follows like an obedient dog
the opening is called the moonpool and deepcores submersibles are launched through it
from inside the sub bay it looks just like a swimming pool
flatbed surfaces nearly filling it
the chamber also contains cab one a similar submersible
jammer perry and some of the other drill room boys are helping the divers out of the water
the water at this depth is only about six degrees above freezing and these folks are cold and prune fingered
finler pulls off his demand helmet revealing a round boyish face
whats goin on
how come we got recalled
hell is i know
one night jumps ashore from flatbeds broad deck and joins them
catfish is unzipping his bulky dry suit
just follow standard procedure will ya
flog the dog till somebody tells us whats happening
hey catfish ill sell you my october penthouse for twenty bucks
save you money darlin
the pages are all stuck together by now
bud enters approaching the group
whats goin on boss
folks ive just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig
were being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security
now you know exactly as much as i do
so just get your gear off and get up to control
theres some kind of briefing in ten minutes
the whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing
demarco is on the main monitor with his aides and kirkhill visible b
at local time this morning an american nuclear submarine the uss montana with men aboard went down miles from here
there has been no contact with the sub since then
the cause of the incident is not known
pan around the reactions of the various drill crew members
shocked hushed curious
your company has authorized the navys use of this facility for a rescue operation
the code name is operation salvor
you want us to search for the sub
we know where it is
but shes in feet of water and we cant reach her
we need divers to enter the sub and search for survivors if any
buds scowl has been deepening since demarco started to talk
dont you guys have your own stuff for this type of thing
by the time we get our rescue submersible here the storm front will be right on us
but you can get your rig in under the storm and be on site in fifteen hours
that makes you our best option right now
hippy born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid leans forward
why should we risk our butts on a job like this
i have been authorized to offer you all special duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal dive pay
hell for triple time id crawl through razor blades and shower off with lime juice
im here to tell ya you could set me on fire and call me names
look i dont know what kind of a deal you guys worked out with the company but my people are not qualified for this
theyre oil workers
a four man seal team will transfer down to you to supervise the operation
you can send down whoever you like but im the toolpusher on this rig and when it comes to the safety of these people theres me
then theres god
if things get dicey im pulling the plug
i think were all on the same wavelength brigman
now lets get the wellhead uncoupled shall we
bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks
they comment gravely as they pass
when lindsey finds out about this its not gonna be a pretty sight
theyre going to have to shoot her with a tranquilizer gun
a single navy sea king churns through the rain under massive thunderheads
the sea below is whipped by the storm
panning along booted feet four pairs of black military size twelves line up onto
a pair of charles jourdans fives under shapely ankles
wider revealing the four man team of navy seals
and a slender woman in her early thirties
shes attractive if a bit hardened dressed conservatively in a skirt and jacket
project engineer for deepcore
shes a pain in the ass but youll like her
shes holding on grimly sitting crammed in with the seals and a bunch of gear getting tossed around by the storm
the seals are dressed alike in black fatigues
they are muscular finely tuned and extremely dangerous special forces types
the leader of the seal team lieutenant coffey makes his way forward to the cockpit
the pilot is white knuckling his stick trying to hold the great beast of a helicopter in position
through the windshield the deck of the benthic explorer can be seen below pitching in a violent sea
no way im putting her down
i shouldnt even be flying in this shit
cool just hold it over the deck
coffey goes back to the crew deck moving easily in the bucking craft
he nods to the others seals monk wilhite and schoenick
in the open side door wilhite clips a foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the coil
one by one the shoulder the gear bags grab the rope and step out
lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door watching the seals fast roping to the deck
one two three
coffey looks at her
you want to be on that ship theres only one way its going to happen
hes sure she wont go for it
its his certainty that gets her
she sets her jaw
opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag puts her shoes and purse in the bag and grips the bag in her teeth
then grabs the rope and slides down
swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum lindsey fast ropes forty feet to the deck
she steps away an instant before coffey hits behind her
lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides
her nylons are ruined
an air crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases using the rescue sling
the seals catch them as they swing radically across the deck
they navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the mounting storm
then shafts of light become visible above a ridge of rock
flatbed appears trailing two heavy two cables
behind it the mass of deepcore emerges from the darkness its forward lighting array blazing
flatbed is towing it like a tug aided by deepcores own mighty stern thrusters
bud his feet propped up uses joystick controls to fly deepcore maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles
he is guided by the side scan sonar display with hippy assisting in the sonar shack
through the front viewport flatbed can be seen out ahead
mcbride appears on the bridge monitor holding a sheet of weather fax
mcbride on screen well its official sportsfans
theyre calling it hurricane frederick and its going to be making our lives real interesting in a few hours
bud responds via video
i dont know
hurricanes should be named after women
mcbride looks up as the bridge door opens
lindsey enters in a blast of wind wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off
maybe bud is right
bud is surprised to see lindseys face appear on the monitor screen
i cant believe you let them do this
unpreturbed almost cheerful hi lins
i thought you were in houston
i was but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here
only here isnt where i left it is it bud
wasnt up to me
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work
we had over seven thousand feet of hole down for chrissake
i cant believe you let them grab my rig
i designed the damn thing
yup a benthic petroleum paid for it
so as long as theyre hold the pink slip i go where they tell me
i had a lot riding on this
they bought you
more like least rented you cheap im switching off now
virgil you wiener
you never could stand up to fight
you bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead
hippy looks over him trying very hard not to crack up
god i hate that bitch
yeah well you never should have married her then
bud nods fatalistically
ten foot waves crash through the launch well sending up geysers of spray
next to the launch well crewman have attached a lifting cable to cab three eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible
it slams violently in its steel cradle as the drill ship rolls
coffey and schoenick hand the gear bags in to wilhite and monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible
lindsey approaches wearing a borrowed roustabouts coverall
she looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the seals lying on the deck
stenciled on it are the words f
deep suit mark iv
coffey and schoenick push past her to pick it up
lets go gentlemen
we either launch now or we dont launch
coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of cab three and grabs the lifting shackle circling her raised hand to signal the crane man
take her up byron
cab three with lindsey riding its back is pulled up out its cradle and starts to swing violently as explorer pitches
the submersible is then swung out to the center of the launch well
it sways and gyrates above the furious water below
lindsey drops into the upper hatch
kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window
what the hell is she doing out there
son of a bitch
into microphone lindsey
get out of cab three
bates is taking her down
lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the hatch
bates is sick
besides ive got more hours in this thing than he does
to coffey a little change of plan
the little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable and the seals jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space are getting slammed into the walls
lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks
lady we better fish or cut bait
just hold your water okay
to kirkhill so kirkhill we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it
the plug is pulled on demarcos patience
i dont care who drives the damn thing
just get my team in the water
he gestured dismissively to mcbride
cab three you are clear to launch
lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever
to coffey theres only one way its going to happen
she pulls the lever hard
the shackle release drops the sub
it freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right on going after lindsey floods the trim tanks
coffey et al have been slammed hard
the crowd goes wild
we are styling
mcbride filtered roger cab three
lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port
moving up through her lights it will guide her down to the rig
cab three free falls into increasing darkness
soon it is a candle below us in the indigo
one night is driving the tug one handed pouring coffee from a thermos and rocking out to the great truck driving song willing on the beat box shes got propped
up on the sonar rig
fighting white line fever in the best tradition
bud and hippy come in for a rousing chorus
ive been driving every kinda rig thats ever been maaaaade
lit up like a proud peterbilt the rig crossed the trackless wastes
we hear them singing carried over
in total blackness the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the umbilical cable
two hundred feet below it the lights of deepcore resolve out of the darkness
now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom like some monster lawnmower
this is cab three on final approach
gotcha cab three
who is that
that you lindsey
bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name
buds expression is nothing less than stricken
you gotta be kidding me
lindsey executes a degree turn and cruises over the control module back through the a frame toward the docking hatch
the flange of cab threes lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rigs back
there is a clunk as it mates up
lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber
the seals drop down behind her passing their gear through hand over hand
the chamber is spartan with steel benches a folding card table breathing masks and medical supplies
catfish greets them through the tiny porthole at one end
ill be damned
you shouldnt be down here sweet thing yall might run ya stockings
couldnt stay away
you running mixture for us
couldnt ask for better
okay here we go
start equalizing yall
hissss of inrushing compressed gas
the pressure in the chamber rises
the breathing mixture is composed of helium oxygen and nitrogen
catfish monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber watching the gauges with a practiced eye
lindsey and the seals all grab their noses and start making funny faces
popping their ears with the familiar divers equalization technique
they continue as get comfortable
the bad news is we got six hours in this can blowing down
the worse news is its gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later
weve been fully briefed mrs
dont call me that okay
i hate that
alright from now on we watch each other closely for signs of hpns
as if by rote high pressure nervous syndrome
muscle tremors usually in the hands first
nausea increased excitability disorientation
about one person in twenty just cant handle it
they go buggo
theyre no way to predict whos susceptible so stay alert
look weve all made chamber runs to this depth
were checked out
uh huh thats good
coffey turn away well hey
you guys know any songs
they ignore her
start going over some diagrams of the montanas interior
its going to be a long six hours
catfish checks his watch then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri mix manifold watching the gauges
satisfied he leans over to the pressure window in the door checking out the seals
hippy has come down from the control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers
jammer is in a chair reading a louis lamour paperback
those guys aint so tough
i fought plenty of guys toughern them
now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender
catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of hippys face
you see this
they used to call this the hammer
hippy wasnt born then
it looks like the end of a long bus trip
leafing through beat to hell magazines or just staring
lindsey has her feet propped up on the smaller of the seals two equipment cases
she casually toes open one of the latches then the other
glances at coffey
she begins to lift the lid with her toe
gets a glimpse inside of packing foam and what looks like a small black metal box
coffeys foot comes down on the lid slamming it shut
startled she looks up into his cool gaze
curiosity killed the cat
tight on catfishs hands
spinning the wheel on the chamber hatch
cut wider as it cracks open with a virgins sigh and swings aside
yaller done to a turn and ready to serve
the seals nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear
lindsey exists first followed by monk wilhite and schoenick
coffey bends to relatch the small equipment case
he is alone for one moment in the chamber
he raises his hand and stares at it
the fingertips are trembling the slightest bit
he clenches them into a fist and walks out
as lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig she bumps into a large dark mass
hey was there a wall here before
i dont remember a wall here
the wall grins down to her
howdy there little lady
coffey emerges behind them and ignoring lindsey faces jammer
to jammer show us the dive prep area
we need to check out your gear
jammer scowls turns and leads the seals in the sub bay
catfish and lindsey exchange a look
those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit
tight on hippy bathed in the light of the sonar display
he is making kissing sounds at beany who has his inquisitive nose right up to hippys lips
hippy youre going to give that rat a disease
wider as hippy and bud to see lindsey leaning in the doorway
she and bud size each other up
he opts for a jovial approach his eyes wary
not for long
lindsey crossed past him her eyes scanning the banks of equipment almost unconsciously checking checking
getting the pulse of her big iron baby
you never did like being called that did you
not even when it meant something
looking through the front port is that one night up in flatbed
lindsey leans past bud to the gooseneck mike on the console
hi one night its lindsey
one night mimes a puking motion finger down her throat
then she replies with sickening sweetness
oh hi lindsey
lindsey fives the sonar shack the once over
she tweaks some knobs
i cant believe you were dumb enough to come down
now youre stuck here for the storm
dumb hot rod
look i didnt come down here to fight
she crosses past bud and exits into the corridor
bud bolts out of the chair to follow her and hippy scrambles in to take over
bud catches up with lindsey in the corridor and through the following keeps pace with here as she make here inspection
then whyd you come down
she stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe
he almost slams into her
she moves on climbing down the ladder to the lower level
you need me
nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do
what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off
what would have you done
wow youre right
us poor dumb ol boys mightve had to think for ourselves
coulda been a disaster
on the lower level landing lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine rooms
roar of pumps and compressors
lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and roaring machinery
her eyes rove constantly over fittings gauges circuit panels
yelling you wanna know what i think
jeez look where this is set
she scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely
i think you were worried about me
that must be it
lindseys on the move again and bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up
no i think you were
come on admit it
i was worried about the rig
ive got over four years invested in this project
oh yeah right
and you only had three years with me
she looks up at him
youve got to have priorities
the door opens and bud snaps on the light
my bunks the only one i can guarantee wont be occupied
you can grab a couple hours before we get there
lindsey slips past him into his tiny state room the only private bunk on the rig
rank had its privileges
his hand on the door is just level with her eyes
she notices his wedding ring a massive band of pure titanium something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from what are you still wearing that
i dont know
divorce aint final
forgot to take it off
bud stays in the doorway
lindsey takes a heaps of buds cloths off the narrow bunk
start unconsciously straightening the room
i havent worn mine in months
yeah whats his name wouldnt like it
do you always have to call him that
it makes you sound like such a hick
his name is michael
lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks
bud eyes her sounding too causal
so what about michael then
you still seeing him
no i havent seen him in a few weeks
bud why are you doing this
its not part of you life any more
ill tell you what happened
you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh
youre right bud
it was just that simple
arent you clever
you should get your own show
bud advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms
she closes the watertight door forcing him out
she turns and throws her shoe hard against the far wall
she flops down on the bed sitting
staring at the wall
her armor is gone
she looks small and vulnerable
a long beat
she reaches over to the tiny sink
amid the clutter is a bottle of buds aftershave
she unscrews it and takes a sniff
bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger
he pulls the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet
he reaches forward to flush
cant do it
now really pissed off at himself he reaches into the toilet bowl wrist deep in the chemical blue water and salvages the ring
he puts it on and washes his hands
the right hand stays faintly blue no matter how hard he scrubs
the platform is stopped hovering in place
like a great spacecraft setting down on a barren planet the rig settles into the bottom ooze
flatbed releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside
close on a photograph actually a computer composited down looking scan from a towed lidar laser imaging sonar rig
it shows a faint blurry outline of the montana lying on her side on a ledge part way down the canyon wall
there is no detail
a finger points to a flat ledge nearby
an x has been put on with a grease pencil
this is us
were just on the edge of the cayman trough
the montana is here on its side meters away and meters below us
we think she slid down the wall and lodged against this outcropping
cut wide showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub bay
the divers bud catfish sonny finler jammer and the four seals have their dry suits on
the pre dive briefing
lindsey one night and hippy will crew the submersibles
wilhite is going around clipping dosimeter badges on everybody
this tells us how much radiation we get
i cant handle no radiation man
include me out
hippy you pussy
what goods the money if your dick drops off in six months
well take reading as we go
if the reactors breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris well back away
hippys not going
mcwhirter you can run little geek
bud pats the top of a small rov sitting next to its larger brother big geek
he cant fly an rov worth shit
to all on the dive you will do absolutely nothing without direct orders from me and you will follow my instructions without discussion
is this clear
alright i want everyone finished prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes
the rig crew disperses picking up helmets and diving gear
some are studying the diagrams of the montanas interior layout
bud takes coffey aside as the others prepare
look its three am
these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep
you better start cutting them some slack
i cant afford slack brigman
hey you come on my rig you dont talk to me you start ordering my guys around
it wont work
you gotta know how to handle these people
we have a certain way of doing things here
im not interested in your way of doing things
just get your team ready to dive
end of discussion
coffey is walking away
burning bud crosses to his gear locker
picks up his helmet
finler is suiting out next to him
hey you know your hand is blue
shut up and get your gear on
nearby monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable
hippy points to the heavy equipment case that says f
deep suit mark iv
ive been meaning to ask you what this thing is
mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit what looks like a space helmet and a large backpack
fluid breathing system
we just got them
we use it if we need to go really deep
shrugs its classified
anyway you breathe liquid so you cant be compressed
pressure doesnt get to you
catfish is grappling with the concept
youre saying you get liquid in your lungs
oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion
monk take a clear plastic box full of o rings off the shelf and dumps them out
he opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside it to drain into the box
then he take beany by the tail off hippys shoulder
check this out
he drops beany in the box and before hippy can protest closes the lid
beany is forced under the surface
he struggled for a second and bubbles come out of his mouth
then he casually swims around in there completely submerged
catfish and the others stare into the box amazed
hes diggin it
monk takes beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his lungs
then hands him back to hippy
the rat is annoyed but otherwise alright
this is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest thing i ever saw
three sets of moving lights move outward from deepcore
cab one and three with lindsey and hippy at the controls respectively and one night in the flatbed
lindsey is in the lead
she approaches the cliff like drop off and starts to descend
com check everybody
flatbed you on line
ten four lindsey read you loud and clear
cab three check
right behind you
whats you depth cab three
going over the wall
coming to bearing
everybody stay tight and in sight
starting out descent
divers howre you doing
eight divers ride the back of flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to the fields
bud and his civilian crew catfish finler and jammer
sit across from the seals
they are in their gear and breathing from umbilical hooked in flatbeds low pressure manifold
okay so far
how deeps the drop off here
this heres the bottomless pit baby
two and a half miles straight down
knock off the chatter
cab one you getting anything
lindsey consults her array of instruments
cab one do you see it yet
the magnetometer is pegged
side scan is showing a big return but i dont see anything yet
are you sure you got the depth right on this
filtered you should be almost to it ace
she turns the submersible and
the spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the montana
it dwarfs cab one filling frame
uh yeah roger that
uh found it
cab one maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub while flatbed and cab three move above it
wilhite take readings with a hand held neutron counter
cab one radiation readings
neutron counters not showing very much
just continue forward along the hull
copy that continuing forward
you just want me to get shots of everything right
roger document as much as you can but keep moving
were on a tight timeline
the great black hull of the montana recedes into the darkness beyond the puny beams of their lights
it seems bigger than the titanic and just as eerie in its final resting place
on it side the subs top deck becomes a wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving
ahead in the lights is a white painted circle
thats the midship hatch
you see it cab three
roger i see it
just get around so your lights are on the hatch
then i just hang with these guys right
how do you want me
just hold above it
alright a team
wilhite schoenick and monk unhook their short whip umbilicals from the central manifold and roll off the side of flatbed
they maneuver down toward the subs hatch
hippy guides cab three in closer to the hatch area
hippy turns to perry back in the lockout chamber ready to launch little geek
the rov has a handheld neutron counter gripped in its manipulator arm
stand by on the rov
perry stand by on the rov
to little geek sorry about this little buddy
better you than me know what i mean
hippy nods and perry drops little geek through the hatch into the water and feed out a length of tether
hippy picks up the control box and watches the video screen guiding the rov toward the montanas hatch
the three seals have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch
they open the out hatch and monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk
he bangs on the inner hatch with a wrench listening carefully with his helmet pressed against it
alright im opening her up
straining hard in the confined space he get the lower hatch open then swims backs out immediately
he gestures to hippy via little geeks vision and hippy flies the rov into the hatch
meanwhile cab one and flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull
beyond lindseys front port the great hatches of the trident missile tubes roll toward us in procession
several of the hatch covers have been forced partway open by the warping of the hull
radiation is nominal
the warheads must still be intact
how many are there
eight mirvs per missile
and how powerful are they
your mirv is a tactical nuke kilotons nominal yield
say times time hiroshima
this is world war three in a can
lets knock off the chatter please
tight on video screen little geeks camera
passing through a hatch into a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery
the engine room
getting a reading
its twitching but its below the line you said was safe
monk moves into the opening
lets get in there
wilhite and schoenick follow him through the escape trunk into the dark corridor beyond
out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail big as a five story building
far below her flatbed moves along the edge of the ledge which supports the vast sub
its lights and lindseys strobes reveal the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail
the torn and twisted hull looms above flatbed as it sets down
coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away from the rest of the hull
well go in through that large breach
lets go guys
buds team leaves flatbed swimming forward
the opening is a black mouth in their lights
coffey moves inside
bud attaches one end of an orange nylon line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him
take it slow stay on the line and stay in sight
watch for hatches that could close on you or any loose equipment that could fall
jammer catfish finler and sonny follow him inside
they find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of bunks
the room is twisted and disheveled with bedding hanging from the bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs
papers float in gentle eddying currents letters pages from paperback novels photos of girlfriends
bud pays out the line and follows coffey forward
as they pass sealed doors coffey pounds with a tool listening
monk leads his team along a corridor following little geeks tether
through a hatch into the engine room
their lights play over flooded machinery
from the berthing coffeys team swims up a companionway towards the attack center
he pulls at a buckled watertight door
give me a hand
jammer and bud squeeze in around coffey
together they wrench the door open on its squealing hinges
it give way suddenly flying open
the suction pulls something through
it slams buds shoulder
right in front of him
he jerks back gasping
face to face with barnes the sonarman
the ensign seems unmarked merely dismayed at his own mortality judging from his wide eyes and mouth
coffey reaches past bud and pushes the ensigns body out of the way
alright lets keep moving
we knew we were going to see this
they enter the control room
their lights play over the high tech wreckage
floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl in the currents
a languid weightless waltz
they move through the carnage
their lights pick out tableaux
the planesman still strapped in his chair someone jammed into the ceiling pipes hanging down
dead faces pale in the lights
we see only glimpses
coffey locates the captains body and rolls it over
removes the missile arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead mans neck
bud turns back to his guys
he notices jammer is breathing so rapidly hes fogging his helmet
catfish finler and sonny arent much better
a wave a panic seems imminent
how you guys doing
im alright im dealing
triple time sounds like a lotta money bud
were here now
lets get her done
we see bud working calming them talking them through it
hes sweating rivers in his helmet not looking too steady
his projection of calm to the others is his own salvation
coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room
this part i do alone
brigman take you men and continue aft
split up into two teams of two
lets get moving
we head back in fourteen minutes
bud leads his team into a narrow corridor
they search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to a vertical hatch open
a pit of darkness below
okay cat lew sonny
you guys stay on this deck
hook you line onto mine
any problem you tug my line
jammer youre with me
bud drops down through the hatch to the level below followed by jammer who barely fits through
catfish hooks his safety line onto buds with a carabiner and move along the corridor with the others
lindsey circles the hull documenting photographing
her strobes sear the darkness give glimpses of the dead leviathans form as her tiny submersible circles it like a bee
working from a plastic card coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens it
he removes several plastic binders
the code books
he also grabs handfuls of classified documents and orders and a set of missile arming keys all which he places in a pouch at his waist
bud leads jammer through a long claustrophobically narrow corridor tapping on the walls and hatches periodically
after he taps he waits a few moments
there are no answering taps
they open doors and shine their lights into the rooms
the are bodies but they seem anonymous
crumpled shapes in khaki or blue
they undog and open a hatch
beyond it is the largest chamber of the sub the
the missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long and forty feet high with two rows of vertical launch tubes in all
the chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork
where are we
those are the launch tubes
they sweep their lights around the chamber
his beam illuminating a body just beyond the door
a coveralled seaman turning slowly in the eddying current
small albino crabs crawl slowly over the mans face
one scuttles out of his gaping mouth
hey you okay
bud goes to him
gets up close to his face
sees that hes not
that hes hyperventilating
bud grabs him by the shoulders
deep and slow big guy
deep and slow
just breathe easy
theyre all dead bud
theyre all dead
some of them
im taking you back out
im okay now
i just dont
i cant go any further in
bud sees that the big divers breathing has stabilized
he looks at his watch
checker jammers pressure gauges
you stay right here
i have to go there to the end
youll see my lights
well stay in voice contact
just hold onto the rope
five more minutes
he moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge cylinders
he pays out the lifeline as he goes
coffey is working rapidly and efficiently moving from one rack of electronics gear to the next setting thermite grenades at vital points
as the thermite ignites it generates an intense arc bright light and tremendous heat
the circuit chasses melt
coffey works calmly in the infernal glare
bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the missile compartment
he goes down a stairwell to the lower level
a hundred feet away jammer loses sight of buds dive lights
he starts to get nervous
suddenly his own lights begin to dim flickering lower and lower
they become little orange candles the filament barely glowing
the darkness closes in
you readin me
bud at the same moment is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet lights which are dimming and flickering
he hears nothing from his helmet transceiver
jammer smacks the side of his helmet
shakes the transceiver on his belt
then even the static dies
he grabs the safety line and pulls twice
it is snagged on a sharp metal edge ten feet from him
he pulls twice more harder hauling the thing
the line severs
jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward him
his eyes bug
he looks all around in the darkness
cant see bud
cant decide what to do
we can see hysteria revving up inside him like a flywheel
then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls
it is a cold and ethereal light unlike the warm white of their dive lights
it grows brighter
he turns slowly toward it
the glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck sending shafts of cold light flickering upward hypnotically coming toward him
is that you
jammer shielding his eyes staring into the radiant source
guess what jammer
its not bud
in the brightest center of the glow something is moving a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls
jammer blinks against the glare his face registering total outright astonishment melting into terror
the glare pulses subtly hypnotically
the shifting shadow falls across jammer
he finally snaps out of his fixity
screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand through the treacherous wreckage
his harness catches on a twisted pipe
he struggles totally out of control
the big man reduced to a blind panic
jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength
he tears free of the entangling debris
launches like a torpedo
slamming his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway
his tri mix regulator takes the full brunt of the impact
on bud swimming furiously back toward jammers position
the strange radiance is gone
his dive light flare back to full brightness
answer me buddy jammer
he reaches jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place
bud grapples with him
hang on big guy
catfish sonny and finler arrive from the corridor a moment later
they leap into the fray
its his mixture
too much oxygen
then theyre all yelling at once grappling with the big man struggling with the valves on his breathing gear
crank it down man
were gonna losing him
shit its stuck
you got it
you got it
jammers convulsion ends
he goes limp
we gotta get him out of here
to jammer hang on buddy
they drag jammers slack form into the corridor hauling their way rapidly back along the lifeline
lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail maneuvering to clear the horizontal diving plane
then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose power
suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and something appears right in front of her a glowing object moving like a bat out of hell right
it is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get a glimpse
what we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside
like some hallucinatory jet engine
and its hauling ass
lindsey jinks left
the object jogs right
she fights the control as her sub slews around slamming broadside into the sail
her power comes back up
righting can one she spins to look through the aft viewport in time to see the object racing away in a broad arc
it pulls a high g turn and dives straight down
we see the object zip behind flatbed
one night cant see it
the thing spirals down into the darkness like a hit and run drunk diving along the wall into the abyss until it is lost to view
hold on lindsey excited amazed
her hands are shaking
suddenly buds voice blares out over the open frequency
meet me at flatbed
this is a diver emergency
do you copy
she has a hard time focusing on what hes saying
copy you bud
on my way
jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the infirmary
monk who is cross trained as a medic as well as a demolitions man has hung an iv of something
bud and the seal are in the room the others hovering outside
im a medic which is mostly about patching holes
this type of thing
theres not much i can do
the coma could last hours or days
bud torn by guilt gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot
the seals minus monk are all gathered inside debriefing with demarco via closed circuit video
demarco video did any of you see it
but there was definitely a russian bogey
the brigman woman saw it
cinclantflts gonna go apeshit
two russian attack subs a tango and victor have been tracked within fifty miles of here
and now we dont know what the hell they are
okay i dont have any choice
im confirming you to go to phase two
wilhite and schoenick glance uneasily at each other
coffey is silent
he is vibrating with tension
his fists clenched to prevent the shaking
he is wrestling with the moment knowing it is in a way a point of no return
is there any problem
i mean no
coffey takes a deep breath
lets it out
phase two is clearly a big deal
the maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation
an adjoining head serves as darkroom
lindsey is glumly reassembling cab ones camera housings
did you get anything on the cameras
video or anything
look forget it
i dont want to talk about it
be that way
i dont know what i saw
coffey wants to call it a russian submersible fine
its a russian submersible
but you think its something else
one of ours
talk to me
lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge
jammer saw something in there something that scared the hell out him his mixture got screwed up
he panicked and pranged his regulator
but what did he see that made him panic
what do you think he saw
i dont know
i dont know
hippy comes pounding up sticks his head in gesturing animatedly
hey you guys
hurry up check this out
theyre announcing it
they follow him into the corridor trotting down to the mess hall
general melee as they rush in everybody focused on the tv
turn it up bozo
the kremlin continues to deny russian involvement in the sinking of the trident sub uss montana
the navy has not released the names of the crewmembers who are all presumed dead at this time
civilian employees of a benthic petroleum offshore drilling rig hey thats us
are apparently participating in the recovery operation but we have little information about their involvement
on the scene now is booooh
we want names
theres the explorer
a long lense video shot of the benthic explorer and the other vessels in a stormy sea cuts to a shot of bill tyler the on scene reporter in rain
gear clutching his microphone
he is on the deck of a navy support ship being used as a staging area from the press well away from the center of the operation
there is a tremendous amount of activity
with cuba only miles away the massive buildup of us ships and aircraft in the area has drawn official protest from havana and moscow and has led to a redirection
of soviet warships into the caribbean theater
how would you describe the mood there
the mood is one of suspicion even confrontation
a number of russian and cuban trawlers undoubtedly surveillance vessels have been circling within a few miles throughout the day and soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away from the
bud lindsey and hippy walking along the corridor hippy in a black mood of incipient paranoia
whats the matter with you
now were right in the middle of this big time international incident
like the cuban missile crisis or something
figured that out for yourself did you
we got russian subs creeping around
something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here man
give our folks medals know what i mean
hippy just relax
youre making the women nervous
no i mean it
those seals arent telling us diddly
somethings going on
hippy you think everythings a conspiracy
one night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay
coffeys splitting with flatbed
he got me to show him the controls then his guys suited up and theyre rolling
bud breaks into a run passing her
dyou tell him we need it right now
i told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool roiling with turbulence
he runs to the edge and looks down
flatbed is a vague shape moving off
the sky is charcoal the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes
waves thunder over the foredeck whipped by eighty know winds
men in life jackets scurry like insects
off the port bow the asw destroyer albany vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall
mcbride scream orders that cant be heard to the crewmen on deck
he staggers back along the bridge railing
mcbride steps into the quiet of the control room
he turns on de marco
were trying to get unhooked and get out of here
and your boys go sightseeing
theyll be back in two hours
were gonna be getting the shit kicked out of us by our friend fred in two hours
de marcos expression is infuriatingly calm
mcbride looks at his watch and swears under his breath
for a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated by divers lights
tiny figures the divers move like moths around a distant streetlight
wilhite monk and schoenick are clustered around an open missile hatch
using a large lift bag they are removing the frangible fiberglass or diaphragm
coffey pilots flatbed with increasing deftness deploying the big arm to aid in the work
down angle as the diaphragm lifts away
revealing the blunt nose of the trident c missle
like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet aimed right at you
tight on video screen a helicopter shot of a warship burning rolling ponderously as it sinks in stormy seas
little is known at this hour about the events leading up to the collision
the us navy guided missile cruiser appleton apparently struck the soviet udaloy class destroyer in low visibility conditions
various cuts of men in life jackets among huge waves
rescue helicopters hovering
shaky camera work
intercut with reactions of the rig crew watching
in violent seas little hope remains for over a hundred russian crewmen still missing after the sinking an hour ago
shot of american cruiser burning listing to one side in heavy seas
replaced by shot of network anchorman
soviet military spokesmen have claimed that the collision constituted an unprovoked attack
this was denied it continues
bud looks at lindsey
she turns to him expression grim
bud this is big time
the divers are working head first in the missiles launch tube
monk reads from a plasticized card directing the other two step by step
the arcane litany is punctuated by the hissing rasp of their breathing
wilhite filtered separation sequencer disconnected
monk filtered remove explosive bolts one through six in counterclock wise sequence
schoenick filtered check
removing bolt one
on the rig crew watching
bathed in the light of the video screen
just learned that soviet negotiators have walked out of the strategic arms limitation summit in protest over the incident this morning
bud switches the channel
us and nato military forces have been put on full alert worldwide this morning in the wake of
its on every channel
bud switches again
reception is getting worse as the storm affect the satellite down link to explorer
the screen shows a reporter on a city street stopping people at random
their answers are edited together you just feel so hopeless
you can see it coming but what can you do
what can anyone do
hey they dont want war any more than we do
you think about it you say
hey they love their kids too
so why are we doing this
he is replaced by a self righteous middle aged woman
if the russians sank that submarine they deserve what they got and a lot more if you ask me and you did
i think weve been pussyfooting around with them long enough
it is now clear what the seals are doing
using large lift bags and flatbeds big arm they have pulled one of the trident c missiles partway out of its launch tube and have partially disassembled the nose shroud
exposing several of the mirv warheads within
moving very carefully wilhite and schoenick ease one of the individual mirvs out of its bracket
hanging under a lift bag in a jerry rigged harness the three foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of flatbed
another man in the street interview tortured by static
im scared less
but if it happens it happens nothing i can do about it
so why think about it
flatbed surfaces in boiling foam
the rig crew are all waiting
like a crack pit crew buds people leap onto flatbed while its deck is still awash and start to work on to navy divers unsealing their helmets and uncoupling their
hippy and bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped in one of the seals gear bags
coffey emerges from the hatch
dont touch that
just step away
coffey were a little pressed for time
secure the package
the two seals unlash the object in the black bag
bud an lindsey exchange a glance
he glares at coffey as they pass each other
one night nimbly climbs the hatch tower and drops in
bud swings the heavy hatch up balancing it and grins down at one night
this aint no drill slick
make me proud
piece of cake baby
he swings the hatch closed with a clang
the big a frame massive as a railroad bridge to which the umbilical from the explorer is attached
flatbed rises into frame arcing around the coupling mechanism f
one night deploys the big hydraulic arm
it unfold from flay bed like a huge steel spider leg its claw like gripper opening
an alarm sounds stridently on the dynamic positioning console
were losing number two thruster
deep in one of the catamaran hulls the positioning thruster motor is screaming like a steel banshee above its usual roar
it explodes with smoke and shrapnel
a roaring fire erupts
crewmen run shouting in the smoke
now a klaxon is going off as the ship begins to slew in the high winds
its not holding
were swinging out of position
as the ship slews the umbilical is drawn off vertical
it goes tight as a bowstring
pulled to the edge of the launch well it rips down the side with a godawful screech tearing loose ladders and floats
flatbeds manipulator has gripped the de coupling mechanism when the cable suddenly pulls taut
the sub is jerked sideways its grip dislodged
we see one night get tossed around inside
lindsey is in the corridor with a cup of tea when the whole rig booms like a gong and lurches sideways
shes wearing her tea when bud tears through a doorway and goes pounding past her
the intercom blares
hippy intercom bud to control
bud to control
bud claws his way up the ladder to level two
the rig booms and shudders as
the rig begins to move
the enormous skid breaks loose
start to slide plowing furrows in the bottom
one night junks the controls pivoting her submersible as the a frame looms toward her
bud runs in past hippy and grabs the mike
pay out some slack were getting dragged
the winch man staggers along the railing blasted by knot winds
he sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical winch
a wave blasts him into the bulkhead
he half crawls to the ladder going up to the winch house
as he climbs the winchs heave compensator slides up and down filling frame behind him
it is bottoming out with a sound like a piledriver overloaded by the strain on the cable
it chooses that moment to fail
grinding crash of metal
lindsey has joined bud looking out the front viewport
were heading right for the drop off
the deck is ripped upward as the entire ton crane is pulled over by the weight of deepcore
it topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured steel that rivals the storm
an explosion of water
underwater the crane tumbles between the twin hulls
trailing a vortex of foam and debris it roars down on us filling frame with blackness
mcbride stares in shock at the churning cauldron of the launch well
grabs the underwater telephone
weve lost the crane
everyone is stunned by what is happening
lindsey fires up the sonar
its dropping straight to us
she puts the signal over the speakers and the room fills with eerie pinging
bud shouts over the intercom
rig for impact
seal all exterior hatches
various angles quick cuts as everyone runs to comply the rig crew pounding down the narrow corridors
diving through low hatchways
hatches are closed and the wheels spun down
hippy puts into a zip lok bag and seals it
the umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above draping itself over the habitat in large coils
one night pilots her submersible feverishly among the falling loops
she banks and twists
a length of heavy umbilical slams onto her neck tipping the sub
she manages to get out from under it a keep going
through the front viewport they can see the coils of cable piling up in front of the rig
the hull booms with impacts as the massive stuff hits
everyone hold their breath as the sonar return pings get closer
an enormous shape plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig
the ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them
a clean miss
much whooping and cheering
the crane topples slowly over the back
it rolls down the slope of the drop off gathering speed
then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon
the coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon
and theyre still attached
an agonizing few seconds
the cable pulls taut
the rig is slammed by the shock
everyone is knocked off his feet into walls and equipment
the rig begins to slide
it tilts over the embankment and grinds down the slope of the drop off in a cloud of silt
the cable pulling it inexorably toward the cliff
the framework twists and slams into rocks
screeching and groaning of tortured steel
all hell has broken loose
sirens screaming a klaxon hooting moronically
bud sprints from control bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig lurches and tilts
the lights go out
emergency light come on
he trips and falls scrambles up running on
in the ladderwell of trimodule c lindsey runs toward the machine rooms
a searing bright explosion in the electrical room
flames roar through the doorway
she dashed to a seawater hose hanging nearby and starts to unroll it
she sees coffey and schoenick in maintenance lashing down the mystery package
get on this hose you turkeys
monk is working in a spray of seawater turning valves to stop the flow of ruptured pipes
behind him a wall of flame blossoms through the door from the electrical room driving the back with the heat
a reservoir tanks breaks loose from one of the compressor assemblies
in rolls at him crushing his legs against machinery
the fire roars into the room
hippy runs in
the place is going nuts
water floods from the moonpool as the rig tilts
wilhite is dancing across the deck leaping over compressed gas cylinders which are rolling around loose
cab one jumps clear off its cradle and slides screeching across the deck
wilhite running before the tom juggernaut had no place to go
the seal dives into the churning moonpool
cab one slams into the end wall then spins and rolls toward hippy
he starts to run
beany in his zip loc bag is lying in the path of the slide submersible
hippy runs back
scoops up the baggie
cab one fills frame behind him
he makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him buckling the steel doorframe
wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool
he gets his fingers over the top
pulls himself up
a steel helium tank slams against his fingers crushing them and he falls back
more tanks bounce over the lip of the pool hammering wilhite down into the foaming water
he doesnt surface
the rig is sliding to the edge of the cliff
the bottomless pit of the cayman trough
it slams crushing and twisting into a rock outcropping and stops hanging over the precipice
perry is trapped as the trimodule floods with stunning swiftness
he makes it through an emergency hatch between floors but cant get it closed
the inrushing tide blasts it open
he scramble upward to the next hatch
spins the wheel
he is slammed against the ceiling by the force of the water
lew finler tommy ray dietz and lupton mcwhirter fight their way toward the door as the drill room floods rapidly
ahead the big automated watertight door is closing like a motorized bank vault
they reach it just as it is closing but cant prevail against the strength of the motors
from the far side we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in the door
we can hear the dull thunk of their pounding
coffey and schoenick in emergency breathing masks are fighting the fire with a seawater hose and fire extinguishers
smoke and steam choke the dark chambers
nearby lindsey grabs hippys arm as he is running past and drags him into the blazing compressor room
hands him her seawater hose
wide eyes he starts blasting everything in sight with water
hold it on me
she rushed into the teeth of the fire as hippy blasts her with a spray of water following her into the intense heat
she grabs monk who is semiconscious and drags him out of the blazing room
hippy dancing back with the hose tripping blasting her in the face
but it works
they get monk clear
bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the drill room swirl above the pressure window obscuring the faces of the trapped men
he claws futility at the door
the motors and the fail safe latching mechanism are on the opposite side
through the pressure window he watches helplessly as they drown
we dont see what he sees but we know what he sees
suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing torrent thunders in
bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor
he scramble up somehow splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably
hes not going to make it
he reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through
grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with the strength of this arms
it doesnt work
the steel door closes on the fingers of his left hand pinning them in the doorframe
but something amazing happens
his wedding ring lodges between the door and frame preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from sealing and locking
it resists tons of pressure denting but not collapsing
the freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear
on the other side of the door catfish and sonny come pounding up
they see his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door
sonny wedges a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry
catfish whips open his jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator
he is sprayed with red hydraulic fluid machine blood
together they force open the door
bud is blown through in a torture of water
sonny is thrown back into some pipes
breaks his arm
together they somehow heave the door shut manually cutting off the flow
catfish hammers the fail safe latch home with the crowbar
bud lies gasping and shivering
staring at the tiny band of metal that saved him
looking down the wall of the canyon as big geek moves beneath us tilting up to show deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss
the rig is twisted and dented covered with loops of umbilical trimodule a a mass of wreckage
the rov passes across the front of the control module
through the front port two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp
static mayday mayday
this is deepcore two calling benthic explorer
do you read over
sonny flips some switches on the uqc acoustic transceiver
benthic explorer benthic explorer
do you read over
this is deepcore forget it sonny
bud walks down the corridor from control slowly
as if carrying a great weight
the air is still thick with smoke
the power off
everything lit by emergency lights
makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess hall with blankets laid out on the tables and with folding cots in the storage room across the hall
jammer is still unconscious
coffey and schoenick bring monk in on a stretcher and set him up on a table
he is conscious but dazed with painkillers his led splinted
did you find wilhite
he and bud lock eyes
bud bites back on his recriminations but his gaze blames coffey
he turns away
bud turns i was under orders
i had no choice
coffeys manner is subdued contrite
a marked contrast to his previous brusque arrogance
hes wrestling with his own loss a sever blow to the tight brotherhood of a seal unit
buds anger is not dispelled
but he cant address it now
he moves on
past the infirmary where sonny dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken arm
he cries out in pain cursing at himself
looking down the central well as bud crosses
down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level of the module is flooded
catfish is down there welding sending shivering reflections through the chamber
lindsey is working up to her knees in water
she is covered with grease tools scattered around
bud puts his hand on her shoulder
she looks up blows some hair out of her eyes
whats the scoop ace
i can get power to this module and sub bay if i remote these busses
ive gotta get past the mains which are a total melt down
rather than trigger anger and invective the disaster seems to have affected her in a different way
shes accepted the situation now thats its done and is immersing herself in technical tasks which are for her therapeutic
need some help
no i can handle it
there wont be enough to run the heaters
in a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker
what about o
weve got about hours worth if we close off the sections were not using
the storms gonna last longer than hours
i can extend that
theres some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module
ill have to go outside to tie onto them
she goes back to her task working efficiently with a socket wrench
she looks up im glad your here
well im not
the sub bay is still a mess
a few battery operated lamps
flatbed is back floating in the moonpool
one night and hippy are in deep concentration piloting the two rovs in a damage survey of the rig
bud comes up behind them check her screen first
big geeks monitor shows a view of the aft section of the rig
the drilling derrick had collapsed across cab three totaling it
a girder is jammed through its acrylic front dome
right through the brainpan
deadern dogshit boss
to hippy wherere you
little geek rises up through the open central hatch pivoting in a circle to scan the flooded interior
tight on video screen little geeks pov
the interior of the structure is a shambles
the lights of the little robot fall upon a figure
lying on the deck almost looking like hes asleep
lets his breath out slowly thats it then
finler mcwhirter dietz and perry
gestured at the screen do we just leave him there
yeah for now
our first prioritys to get something to breathe
catfish and lindsey in suits and helmets drop down from the glare of the moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig
walking they pull their umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage
little geek follows along like a dog at their heels
they settle beside a valve assembly at the base of the wrecked module
cat you tie onto this manifold
theres some tanks on the other side im gonna go check them out
you watch yourself
he begins to attach one end of a coiled up high pressure hose to a manifold
she takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness
little geek goes with her faithfully
cab one is hanging from the overhead crane while one nigh works to repair it
bud is nearby tending hose for the divers and handing her tools
talking while they work
hippy is across the moonpool running little geek
gimme a three eighths socket on a long extension
he hands it to her so there you were there we were side by side on the same ship for two months
im tool pusher and were testing this automated derrick of hers
so we get back on the beach and
were living together
doesnt mean you had to marry her
we were due to go back out on the same ship
six months of tests
if you were married you got a state room
otherwise it was bunks
okay good reason
it was alright for a while you know
but then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing couple years ago
she went front office on you
tighten that for me right there
well you know lindsey too damn aggressive son of a
hes jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt
whips his hand out
she didnt leave me
she just left me behind
she puts her arm around his shoulders somehow managing to be fraternal maternal and suggestive all at the same time
bud let me tell you something
she aint half as smart as she thinks she is
she smiles and pretends to kink lindseys air hose
across the chamber hippy scowls as little geeks screen starts to go haywire with interference
hey lindsey you reading me
catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while lindsey is on the other out of sight
she is standing on the bottom at the base of the wreckage checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage
right at the edge of the canyon wall
behind her is a sheer drop to nothingness yeah hippy i read you
whats the matter
the reply is garbled by a wash of static
then for no apparent reason lindseys helmet light begins to dim out
little geeks lights fade
his motors whine to a stop
on catfish as his lights drop to candleglows
the emergency lights are dimming like a brownout
bud grabs the diver intercom mike
lins howre you doing
on lindsey as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack
i got a problem here
behind her something rises from the depths
it is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the montana wreck
it comes right up behind her
she doesnt know its there
it hovers sideways like a hummingbird as if curious trying to get a better look
she becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her
she turns slowly
we see her react as the glowing pulsing apparition is reflected in her faceplate
a more powerful glow washes up onto her from below
her eyes go down
she gasps absolutely stunned
above the edge of the wall an enormous shape rises silently out of the depths
over sixty feet across
it looks like a blown glass manta ray its transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and complexity pulsing with a blue violet glow
lindsey stand before it unable to move
captivated by its ethereal beauty
it begins to turn majestically one rounded wing passing only a few feet above her
she reaches up
touches it as it passes over her
lindsey is without fear completely mesmerized
the thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall
she is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water
about that time lindsey remembers she has a still camera a little nikonos
she fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful machine glides into the depths
gets all set for a shot and
the little scoutschip whizzes past her from behind startling her
she completely misses the shot of the manta ship
she pivots trying to get a shot of the little one as it zig zags down along the wall fast as a meteor
she get a shot a second before it disappears
from around the flank of the rig module catfish appears
their com sets come backs to life along with their lights
you better not say you missed that
tight on slide strip
lindseys fingertip in for scale
the shot is black with a little squiggle of light in the center
nice shot lins
what is that
you drop your dive light
wider showing the group huddled around lindsey who has her freshly processed slide roll laid out on the pinball machine using it as a light table
come on you guys
look this is the little one right here
you can see how its kind of zigging around
if you say so
it could be anything
im telling you what is there
youre just not hearing
the impulses somehow arent getting from you ears to your brainpan
theres something down there
she looks around
sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her
yall could be more specific
something non human but intelligent
you mean like coffey
lindsey is reddening
despite her conviction this is really hard
a non terrestrial intelligence
non terrestrial intelligence
yeah i like that better then ufos
although that works too
underwater flying objects
hippy is not really mocking her
hes actually into it
but it has that effect
catfish is eyeing lindsey like hes never seen her before
are we talkin little space friend here
hot rods of the gods
hey no really
it could be ntis
the cia has known about them for years
they abduct people all the time
there was this woman i knew in albuquerque who hippy do me a favor
stay off my side
bud takes her firmly by the arm
heads her out into the corridor
lindsey will you step into my office for a minute
he propels her along the corridor away from the mess hall doorway
they face each other in the narrow space
jesus lindsey bud something really important is happening here
im just trying to hold this situation together
i cant allow you to cause this kind of hysteria whos hysterical
theyre talking across each other not connecting
bud weary and frustrated
lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter
all im saying is when youre hanging on by your fingernails you dont go waving you arms around
i saw something
im not going to go back there and say i didnt see it when i did
god you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew
i need you to believe me bud
look at me
do i seem stressed out
any of the symptoms of pressure sickness any tremors slurred speech
bud this is me lindsey
you know me better than anybody in the world
now watch my lips
i saw these things
i touched one of them
and it wasnt some clunky steel can like we would build
it was the most beautiful thing ive ever seen
bud is stilled by her intensity
she moves close to him
eyes alive and luminous
it was a machine but it seems almost alive
dance of light
bud you have to trust me
i dont think they mean us harm
i dont know how i know that its just a feeling
how can i go on a feeling
you think coffeys going to go on you feeling
we all see what we want to see
coffey looks and he sees russians he sees hate and fear
bud you have to look with better eyes than that
bud has been taking this all in
his eyes tracking her face
he closes his eyes taking a deep breath
its so hard for him to do this but
i cant lindsey
how can i
coffey has bud lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little summit
lindsey is withdrawn sitting far from the others a self imposed exile
theyre all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves
their breath shows in the air
i want round the clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras
we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion
rolling her eyes gimme a break
coffey these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench
theyre not speaking russian
coffey looks at her for a moment then goes on as if she hadnt spoke
to one night why havent you finished repairs on the hydrophone transmitter yet
i was having my nails done
coffey is sweating despite the chill
keeps his hands clenched in fists so they wont see how bad the tremors have gotten
get something straight
you people are under my authority look podner
we dont work for you we dont take orders from you and we dont much like you
in addition to which your momma dresses you funny
coffeys eyes are straight razors
he slashes them from face to face
you can see him tightening up like a clockspring losing control of the situation in front of his own men
bud defuses it
take the first watch in sonar
hippy you handle the exterior surveillance
one night see if you can get that transmitter working for me okay
gimme a couple of hours
hold on coffey as everyone leaves
coffey and schoenick are bending over the warhead
they have a small port removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an electronic detonator
the black box lindsey glimpsed earlier
as the two seals work like surgeons we see past coffeys shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him which looks out into the perpetual blackness
a goofy shark face
big geek rises silently in front of the port
it moves a little trying to get a peek over coffeys shoulder
hippy is twiddling his joysticks watching the screen like a ferret
move to the left
just a little more
come on a
thats it on the screen geeks pov
coffey is blocking hippys view of whatever it is theyre working on
abruptly be moves
the warhead is lying there in plain sight detonator wires hooked up
hippys eyes bug out
he knows exactly what it is
pretty radical guys
he hurries to the vcr and puts it into record
video image of the seals working
it freezes on a clear view of the warhead
say hello to mirv
bud has his face right up to screen
he frowns skeptical
come on man
what else could it be
why bring it here
its gotta be like an emergency plan to keep it away from the russians
hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator put it back in the sub and fry the whole thing slickern snot
bud whips around
lindsey standing quietly in the doorway
its apparent from expression shes been watching them for some time
she looks ready to kill somebody
then shes gone
bud catches up to her in the corridor trying to put the brakes on her
look goddamnit if you wont do something about it i will
wait a second she reaches the watertight door to maintenance room b
before bud can stop her she grabs a fire extinguisher off the wall and pounds on the steel door like a big gong
needless to say it opens
she pushes past schoenick see the bomb lying there naked
youve got some huevos bringing this
into my rig
with everything thats been going on up in the world you bring a nuclear weapon in here
does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic or is it just me
you dont need to know the details of this mission
youre better off if you dont
i just need to know that this thing is out of here
you hear me roger ramjet
brigman youre becoming a serious impediment to this mission
i believe the stress is affecting you
to schoenick escort her to quarters and have monk prepare a tranquilizer
schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip
bullshit you cant do that
lindsey goes bananas trying to get schoenicks big hands off her arms
bud slams his hand down on the intercom button
maintenance room b
he pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on coffey
warning him with a look that is not to be messed with
coffey is braced back against the worktable
an odd stance with one arm behind his back
suddenly theres a crowd outside the door as catfish hippy one night and sonny come running up
about a million volts of electricity in the air
bud braces schoenick
let her go
lindsey jerks away
rubs her arms
you dumb jarhead motherf chill out lindsey
whats the problem
everyone is frozen in place
bud a coffey
snake and mongoose glaring
bud pulls lindsey back into the corridor
we were just leaving
to her werent we
angle from behind coffey as buds group moves out of sight up the corridor
hands behind his back
in his hand cocked finger on the trigger is the
he turns and sets it on the table steadying himself as if in the wind
he seems to sag
when he looks at schoenick his eyes are wounds
a hunted animal
they cant be trusted
theyre turning against us
we may have to take
lindsey bud hippy
bud slows letting them trail behind the others
lins stay away from that guy
i mean it
the dudes in bad shape
you see his hands
hes got the shakes
look the guys operating on his own cut off from chain of command
hes exhibiting symptoms of pressure induced psychosis
and hes got a nuclear weapon
so as a personal favor to me
will you put your tongue in neutral for a while
man i give this a sphincter factor of about nine point five
coffey goes to the dome port
looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection into the void
angle from outside
coffeys face in the window
stuck to the acrylic bubble beside him is one of those garfields suction cups on its paws
coffey stares out
behind his eyes his brain is like that cat just hanging on spreadeagle and screaming
under a single worklight a couple of conspirators
lindsey and hippy hunch over big geek
the rov grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth
look you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go and he goes right
well yeah but the tether off it aint gonna be fancy
when he gets down there hell just sit like a dumb shit
unless something wanders through view of the camera youll get nada
lets go for it
we could get lucky
one surveillance monitor
lindsey and hippy next to big geek
their voices are tinny but intelligible
i dont know
i really oughta talk to bud about this
watching them in the dark
just you and me
we get some proof then tell them
if was can prove to coffey its not russians maybe hell ease off the button a little
i gotta tell you that guy scares me a lot more than whatevers down there
squared away goddamn jarhead robot
okay gimme a couple hours on this
coffey watches his jaw clenched
the lights are down
those who can are grabbing some sleep
snoring comes from one of the bunkrooms as lindsey passes
in the mess hall catfish and bud are crashed out on the tables wrapped in blankets
the cold has gotten intense
the walls sweat with condensation
lindsey can see her breath as she makes coffee
she carries a cup over to monk who is a face in a pile of blankets
a hand comes out takes the coffee
lindsey sips hers staring
her thoughts are far away
in the bottomless pit
she is leaning up against the table where bud is sleeping
his soft snoring downshifts into a loud rasp
lindsey touches him gently on the shoulder
virgil turn on your side
bud grunts and turns without waking an automatic response
the snoring stops
it is a quiet intimate moment a reminder of the mileage these two have logged together
sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens
hes asleep chin on his chest
on the main passive sonar screen an almost imperceptibly faint trace appears
a hum which is by now familiar becomes audible
sonny shifts in his seat
hippy puts his tools away finished with the modifications to big geek
all set big guy
hey i told you to wipe that grin off your face
he yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door
switches off the lights
quiet lapping of water in the moonpool
a cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening sending shadows shifting across the top of the chamber
the surface begins to pulsate
suddenly the water itself rises forming itself into a shifting shimmering pseudopod as big around as a mans body
the transparent form pulses
an amoebic mass shivering in the air
it stretches becoming a more refined form
like a blindly probing glass python it elongates and weaves across the room
it extends and extends stretching out from the moonpool a shimmering tentacle
the head or tip a featureless liquid bulb seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward as if it can see where its going
hippy trudges along the dark corridor
he reaches the mens head and goes in
as the door closes the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor b
it looks left and right
then extends the length of the corridor holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake
looking down three levels through the central ladderwell between the cylinders
the pseudopod enters and undulates upward
from inside the makeshift bunkroom we see its tip extend inside
sonny and one night are snoring oblivious
jammer is still unconscious
the pseudopod taking its time checks them out and then moves on
in the mess hall its dark and quiet
lindsey has even fallen asleep in her chair her head buried in her arms on the table
the shimmering tentacle enters the room in total silence
it sways gracefully in to air searching
it undulates across the room hanging about five feet in the air surveying everything
it moves past lindsey
sensing something she lifts her head turning
sees the apparition next to her
her eyes go wide
amazement but not fear
the tentacle is moving on still searching
lindsey shakes bud awake clapping her hand over his mouth
bud blinks twice then freezes
when she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging open like a total goon
bud chucks his pillow are catfish on the next table
catfish cracks one eye open
turns right back
both eyes open now
sensing movement the thing turn back toward them
it seems to recognize lindsey
it doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to her
she holds her ground fascinated
the bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face
it is water still clear and undulating
but definitely lindsey
she gasps in surprise
the liquid lindsey gasps soundlessly
a perfect mimic of her expression
lindsey laughs involuntarily
lindsey makes a face sticking out her tongue
the liquid lindsey does the same
bud has just had the rug jerked out from under his sense of what is possible and what isnt but hes taking it pretty will considering
whispering i think it likes you
its trying to communicate
her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of buds
she reaches out her hand slowly
gingerly her fingers touch the surface
ripples extend outward from the contact across buds features
her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface just like shes dipping her hand into a bowl of water except sideways
she draws her wet fingers out and studies them amazed
touches one fingertip to her tongue
the pseudopod pulls back from her
it loops in the air dramatically full circle
and ties itself into a knot
as the knot tightens down it melts back into the body
the disappearing knot trick
lindsey laughs grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a magic show
she is transported
she looks at bud
he grins broadly
hes with her now
the stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room
out to the corridor coffey and schoenick enter the back way through the dive prep area
they see the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk
coffeys mind is blown
we can smell the insulation burning
he just stares
the water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot wired warhead
it studies the device for a few seconds
bud and lindsey enter through a side door in time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the warhead
they begin to lift it off its cart
coffey finally jump starts his brain
in a flash of insight he runs to the big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor
he and schoenick heave on the door
like a guillotine blade it slices effortlessly through it
various angles corridors mess hall ladderwell maintenance
as the body of the pseudopod collapses splashing on the floor
it reverts to nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater
as the tendrils dissolve the warhead slams back down onto the cart unharmed
on coffeys side on the door however the stump rears back like a cobra
it withdraws rapidly into the moonpool
the glow fades away
sonny wakes up with a start as the hum revs up into a loud whine and then fades away
he scrambles to track it
hippy emerges from the can and looks down puzzled at the puddle running the length of the corridor
he missed the whole thing
lindsey is really strutting high on life now that shes been proven right
okay raise your hand if you think that was a russian water tentacle
well a breakthrough
coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like nicholson in the shining
bud give her a warning look
dont poke at the rattler
you done impressing yourself ace
no way that could just be seawater
they mustve learned how to control water
i mean at a molecular level
they can plasticize it polymerize it
put it under intelligent control
maybe their whole technology is based on that
coffey is hunched over elbows on his knees
his hands are out of sight
his arm is moving in a slow rhythm
we cant see what hes doing
that thing was probably their version of big geek
like an rov
just checking is out huh
angle under the table showing what coffey is doing
he has his k bar knife gripped white knuckle in one hand
he is drawing it slowly and repeatedly across the skin of the other forearm
neat chevrons of blood from wrist to elbow
coffey he doesnt flinch
his eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills
no one notices
hes keeping the edge
theyre curious maybe
we could be the first people theyve seen up close
hope they dont judge the whole race offa us
maybe i oughta shave
coffey stands abruptly snags schoenick with his eyes and leaves walking through the group as if they were smoke
this cold behavior brings the mood down a notch
outside the mess hall coffey pauses listening to the conversation resume
bright speculation a few jokes
coffey is visible shaking
schoenick looks at him with concern
it went straight for the warhead
and they think its cute
you need to get some sleep
coffey walks away without hearing him
schoenick catches up
the door opens in the dark room
coffey enters moving with purpose
he pulls his gear bag out from under the work table
pulls out a short barreled car assault rifle
we have no way of warning the surface
do you know what that means
schoenick doesnt know
he hopes coffey knows
because hes a fearless man whos discovering what it is to be afraid
coffey inserts the magazine with a clack
snaps the bolt
tosses the rifle to schoenick
whatever happens is up to us
hippy passes the maintenance room
the warhead and its cart are missing
he looks around
heads toward the sub bay
the discussion still in progress
you think theyre from down there originally
she jerks her thumb toward the ceiling
i think theyre from you know
some place that has similar conditions
cold intense pressure
happy as hogs in a waller down there probly
hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from the sub bay
he edges forward slowly trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor
slides up along the wall next to the door
inches his eye around the doorframe
across the room
schoenick is working with a chainfall lowering big geek onto the mirv warhead which is still on its cart
he begins to attach them together with a sling of tie down straps
hippy lets his breath out slowly
his expression is holy shit
he slides back along the corridor wall silently
away from the door
then turn turns quickly to go
coffey slams him up against the wall
pressed to hippys temple
hippy gulping air as coffey ears back the hammer
sniff something did you rat boy
the meeting is breaking up as the door clangs open and hippy is thrusted inside
his hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face
coffey steps through smoothly straight arming the
schoenick flanks him with the assault rifle aimed at the group
to monk here hold this a second
were going to phase three
he hands his gun to monk with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team member
monks eyes move between coffey and the pistol
we cant tell what hes thinking
coffey grabs hippy and shoves him onto a chair
theyre using big geek to take the bomb to the ntis
we set it up to go right to them
lindsey looks stricken
her plan is betraying them all
oh my god
steps toward coffey please you cant
coffey think about what youre doing
for gods sake coffey lets her approach him his eyes glittering
without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the coke machine pinning her there with one hand
bud leaps forward
the rifles muzzle is aimed for a heart shot
coffey moves up close to lindsey
this is something ive wanted to do since i first met you
his hand reaches down out of frame
we hear something rip
his hand comes back up
holding a piece of gaffers tape
he slaps it over her mouth
then pushes her down into a chair
hippy looks at monk and schoenick
you boss is having a full on meltdown
guys fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and were all ringside
whats the timer set for
we cant get to minimum safe distance in three hours
the shockwave will kill us
itll crush this rig like a semi driving over a beer can
whats the matter with you
everybody is twitching a hyper
schoenick is white knuckling his assault rifle
looking from monk to coffey to the group
just stay calm
the situation is under control
coffey backs out quickly with schoenick
coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into the mechanism so it cant be opened
schoenick take a position in front of the door
coffey turns and runs through the corridor like demons are chasing him
their only hope is to sway schoenick
but the seals fear is making him the perfect machine totally dependent on external orders
and his orders are clear
they can see him through the tiny window in the door
lindsey rips the tape painfully off her mouth
your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move
that guys craziern a shithouse rat
we have to stop him
they pound on the door
schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny window
using the chainfall coffey maneuvers the completed geek mirv package over the back of flatbed obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it out and launch it
lindsey is up next to the door with bud
hes about to declare war on an alien species schoenick just when theyre trying to make contact with us
to bud i think im reaching him
there is a clunk clatter and the door unlatches
the door opens
jammer is standing there
schoenick is in a heap against the far wall moaning
jammer hands the rifle to hippy as he walks in
hippy turns to cover the other seal
monk puts his hands up passively
im the least of your problems
bud appraises jammer who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay
how you feeling big guy
figured i was dead there when i seen that angel comin toward me
they all look at him for a second
uh okay right
you can tell us about it later
bud drops down the ladder into frame followed by the others
he tries the door into the main corridor
the wheel wont turn
the others get on it
hes jammed the mechanism
theyre locked in trimodule c
no other doors give access to the sub bay corridor
buds mind is racing
he drops down the ladder to level one into about two feet of water
he reaches down and open the emergency lockout hatch
takes off his boots
okay im gonna free swim to hatch six
get inside get the door open from the other side
bud that waters only a couple degrees above freezing
then i guess you better wish me luck huh
catfish is pulling his boots off as well
wish us luck
hands his wallet to hippy case i dont die
lets go podner i aint got all day
bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating
he drops into the water
bed shoots down through the hatch
the cold hits him list a fist becoming instantly paralyzing
he starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark water maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel
catfish is behind him swimming like hell
they reach hatch six
together they spin the wheel and heave upward opening it
bud surges up into the lock
catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him
they try the upper hatch
theyre both panting with the exertion and intense cold
go on to
bud looks at catfish shivering and heaving wide eyed
you head back
bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch
bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit
he sees the lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead
in the moonpool bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of flatbed
his wracked breathing is masked by the whine of hydraulics as coffey uses the external controls to extend flatbeds big hydraulic arm locking the geek mirv in its gripper
bud strokes to a point where coffey cant see him and heaves up out of the water onto the deck of the pool
he lies gasping behind cab ones cradle
his limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold
his fingers are completely numb
he hugs himself putting his hands under his armpits
scans the situation
he cant get to the door which is across the room without coffey seeing him
lindsey watching the whole thing going down on the screen a high angle of the sub bay
bud moving up on coffey
he cant get to the door
i think hes going to try and take him himself
he couldnt be that dumb
the guys a trained killer
buds idea of a fight is arm wrestling one night over laundry duty
on the screen bud picks up a piece of pipe
moves forward crouched
lindsey yells at the screen in frustration
bud chucks a tool across the chamber creating a clattering distraction then wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of coffeys knees taking him down
coffey spins even as he falls catching bud in a scissor kick that topples him
grappling they fall together into the freezing water
coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold giving bud time to haul himself out hoping to make it to the door
coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs
he pulls himself up as bud kick out
claws his way viciously over buds body until he has him pinned to the deck
then he pulls out the
put it unceremoniously to buds forehead
coffey pulls the trigger
bud flinches then opens his eyes staring cross eyed at the muzzle of the
coffey cocks it and tries again
really pissed off beyond description bud hurls the commando off him with a powerful heave sending him clattering against a rack of equipment
they face off panting
the rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of monks voice
i tool the liberty of removing this before i gave it back to him
monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from the
even so bud is getting his ass kicked
coffeys really trying to put him out of business
its mostly duck and dodges on buds part
throw a few things
when coffey connects bud goes down hard
give him credit though
he manages to scramble back up
the fight wrecks the room scattering tools and gear
compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor
coffey slips on one and buds get in a couple of good licks
slams the seals head in an equipment locker door
but the navy man is just too massive
bud is hammered back into a wall
coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace
spins around at the sound of a voice
catfish is right behind him
a trail of water goes back to the moonpool a few feet away
catfishs hammer punch comes in so hard and so fast coffey is knocked right on his ass
he doesnt get up
just sort of flops around
catfish helps bud to his feet
they advance on coffey who crab scuttles sideways his eyes rabid
he picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them
as they duck he sprints to flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down
to catfish get the door
bud leaps across the water to land on flatbed
the hatch is already sealed
he grapples with geek mirv trying to free it from the steel claw
coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilots compartment
he claws his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches
catfish pounds down the corridor like hes never run before his beer gut doing a rumba
he reaches the door tears out the piece of pipe and spins the wheel
hippy pushes it open so fast it hits catfish in the stomach
hippy tears past him running with the assault rifle
flatbed is submerging with only the hatch tower still above the water
bud is being dragged down still trying to free the rov
he gives up when he sees hippy run in waving the assault rifle around like a pound rambo
bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool
hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at coffey visible inside his viewing bubble beneath the swirling water
coffey looks up stares at the gun
doesnt seem to care
hippys squeezing the trigger and nothings happening
flatbeds hatch tower goes under
on the side
up push it up
hippy fumble with the selective fire lever blam blam blam
he put three quick rounds into the ceiling
give me that
he grabs it out of hippys hands and aims it at the sub
he racks the water with a long burst
beneath the surface the rounds nip nasty contrails through the water
they barely scar the front port
go for big geek
catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts trying to hit the shimmering shape of the rov on its back
underwater we see the rounds arcing wild a few hitting the rov but causing little damage
coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor
above catfish empties the weapon
gimme a hand
they all turn
bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman
the others rush over to help him
get the rest of my gear
grab that hat there
lets go guys
come on come on
catfish slams a backpack onto buds shoulders grappling with the straps and hose connections
hippy and sonny with one hand are clipping zipping and buckling all over him
this is a world record suit up time
bud pulls the rubber neck dam of the helmets lower ring down over his face
beneath the habitat coffey is maneuvering flatbed through the twisted pipe and debris left by deepcores slide to the edge
bloodied his fatigues ripped half off he looks like a feral animal
his eyes burn with the determination of his mission
jammer expertly works the crane controls moving cab one out over the moonpool from its drydock cradle
lindsey and one night are scrambling like monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub clambering up to the hatch tower
lindsey hesitates go
youre better in these than i am
lindsey recognizes this for what it is
a sign of respect a reconciliation
she nods and drops through the hatch
coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes a tight turn beneath the drill floor module
flatbed scrapes through between twisted conduit metal screeching on metal
bud has his hat locked down and his air cut on
he take two quick strides to the edge of the pool and just drops in
bud rockets down into frame in a column of bubbles
he looks around
through the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see flatbed moving forward from its exit point under the stern
bud see a shortcut under the platform
he kicks along a lattice a pipes heaving himself along in frantic hand over hand stokes
he reaches for flatbeds stern as it passes
misses the last hand hold
but just manages to seize a tie down trailing behind it
he is jerked along behind the sub
bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful thrusters
flatbed gathers speed moving out toward the edge of the abyssal wall
the current slams him spinning him like a fishing lure
he pulls himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of flatbeds platform
low angle look up the wall
flatbed appears over the edge and stops
on the back of flatbed
bud has the break he needs
he scrambles up onto the deck and opens and equipment locker
nothing in it but one of the yellow nylon safety lines
the big arm begins to unfold lifting geek rov
coffey works intently
his eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a face streaked with blood
he brings the rov into view with the boom arm
geek rov had a passenger
the diver is holding geeks skid with one hand doing something with the other
he turns to look at coffey
coffey releases the rov with the gripper and makes a grab at bud with the steel claw
the gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow
bud kicks away rapidly letting nylon rope pay out
we see he has managed to tie one end to geeks skids
coffey hits the button to activate the rov sending an acoustic pulse to geeks transponder
the little robot pregnant with its load of death turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void
coffey pivots his bid machine toward bud
bud strokes rapidly to a large jumble of wreckage
he loops the rope around a twisted pipe
big geek is hauling ass away from him
the line snap taut an instant later
the rov strains like a rottweiler on a leash
trying to go
the rope is slipping as bud fights to make a knot
flatbed slews around thrusters whining
as it banks it hurls up clouds of sediment from the escarpment face
through the front panel we see coffey jerking on the controls
the big arm extends menacingly
the smaller from manipulators open
an enormous predatory instinct its lights blaring
the big machine roars forward
straight at bud
bud gets his knot partly done
see flatbed looming
glare lit in its lights bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as coffey closes the last few feet
one manipulator slams into his backpack tumbling him and the subs underside rakes across his legs as it passes over
flatbed crushes into the tangle of pipework
coffey is slammed hard over the controls up into the front dome port
he gets back in the seat
strains to free his machine
bud swims clear diving down at an angle along the wall hoping to stay in coffeys blind area
flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris
it pivots toward bud
moves after him
nearby the rov is whining mindlessly trying to please
trying to go
detail of rope attached to wreckage as buds knot begins to slip
the nylon line starts to play through the knot slowly
bud has gotten himself into a bad position
along the bare rock face of the cliff wall he is naked nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a truck
coffey puts the hammer down thrust levers all the way forward
flatbed surges forward multi limbed and demonic
theres no cover side to side up or down
coffey has him head in his lights
suddenly a bright glare blasts in blinding coffey
he looks up to see cab one rushing down upon him full throttle
at the last moment lindsey slams the thrusters full lock and the submersible slews sideways slamming its heavy skidplate into flatbeds cab
coffey is smashed sideways by the shock
he fights to control his vehicle
lindsey looks up to see coffeys sub gun it up over the wall out of sight
she cruises up over bud
bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into cab ones belly
bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut
he ditches his helmet
lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall
through the front port there is not sign of coffey
you owe me one virgil
can we negotiate later
theres big geek
through the front port they can see the rov still straining at its leash
lindsey dives toward it simultaneously working the controls to open her own small manipulator claws
the last few feet of the rope slip through the knot
big geek happily surges forward
it dives gracefully down into the void trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail
one cab one bud and lindsey through the front port
go after it
we gotta catch it
flatbed drops into frame behind them dwarfing little cab one
they are slammed viciously as coffeys submersible hammers into them
she hits full throttle
coffey floors it after lindsey ramming her from behind with his more powerful vehicle
with difficulty lindsey maintains trim
she arcs back toward the rig
flatbed slams her again for the side
she fights for control
bud is tossed around ricocheting off the walls
lindsey flies with her jaw set
fighting hard for control
the a frame of the rig looms before her
she shoots through at full throttle
now the fight is really on
the two subs are dodging between the cylindrical modules at full throttle slamming into each other and the steel pressure hulls
coffey sideswipes the smaller sub jamming it sideways
it screeches along the flank of one of the trimodules
they head out over empty terrain in a flat out speed run
lindsey is jinking and dodging as flatbed roars along behind her tearing up the bottom with its powerful backwash
lindsey carves hard around a rock pinnacle finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon
coffey is ramming hammering from behind then from side to side
hes pissing her off
he shouldnt do that
ahead out of the blackness another outcropping
lindsey rises cuts right
smashes down into coffeys craft
timing it just right
he skids catch in the rocks
flatbed slews violently nosing down
crushing into the rocky bottom
pressing the advantage lindsey hammers into flatbed from behind
it smashes full force into a second spire spinning out of control
tangles together the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the wall
with her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of flatbed and grounds her crippled sub
flatbed tumbles over the edge
angle down the wall as it falls trailing a cloud of sediment like a comets tail down into the unfathomable blackness below
inside the machine coffey is fighting for control
he has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge
as the pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan and steel fitting scream with the enormous load
a tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble
coffey gives up fighting
just stares wide eyed at his death
a damned soul dropping into the bottomless pit
the fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port
suddenly a scythe like curtain of seawater under tons of pressure slashes into him
a moment later the bubble implodes and coffey disappears in a bloody froth of churning water air and glass shards
flatbed looks like a toy tumbling away down the wall
soon its lights vanish
theyre both going to have a lot of bruises
lindsey is surveying the damage
water is spraying down on them like a shower and lights are flickering
you did okay back there
i was fairly impressed
not good enough
we still gotta catch big geek
not in this thing
lindsey is flipping switches
you totaled it huh
so sue me
bud looks down
theres already about a foot of water sloshing around the floor at their feet
its flooding like a son of the bitch
she picks up and hand mike of the underwater telephone
deepcore deepcore this is cab one over
deepcore this is cab one
we need assistance over
deepcore this with a searing crackle or arc light a power panel shorts out and everything goes black
well thats that
looking around theres some light from somewhere
a faint illumination dimmer than moonlight washes in through the front port
lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness
its the rig
a glow beyond a rock promontory
like the lights of a town just over the hill in the desert
good hundred yards id say
theyll come out after us
yeah but its gonna take them a while to find us
we better get this flooding stopped
he picks up his helmet and clicks on the light
using the thing like a bulky flashlight
the water is really pouring in spraying them like a shower
almost two feet deep already
you see where its coming in
somewhere behind this panel
she takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld which is blocked by a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit
cant get to it
have to pull this panel off
you go any tools
i dont know look around
bud scans the cramped interior feels around under the water
its past his knees
son of a bitch
all i needs a goddamn crescent wrench
he grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it trying to wrench it off the wall
heaves on it repeatedly
finally stops panting
hes breathing hard now and its not just effort
son of a bitch
calm down bud
a nervous edge in her voice now
buds turning all around looking around for anything trying to think fast
water up to their waists
the sea closing in
we gotta get you out of here
i dont know how
weve only got one suit
but we better come up with something
she climbs up on the pilots seat scrunching right up against the ceiling keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water
shes shaking all over with the cold and getting drenched from above by water pouring in
okay look you swim to the rig and come back with another suit
seven eight minute swim each way
not enough time
look at this
the rate of flooding time i get back youll be that stops the conversation for a second
about two feet of airspace left
bud cant believe what this is coming down to
they both stare at each other for a long moment
he makes a decision
starts pulling off his backpack
alright put this on
what you growing gills all of a sudden
you got it on keep it on
dont argue goddamnit just no way
not an option
bud has his pack off uncoupling it
she keeps fighting his hands stopping him hooking it back up
the desperation of the situation fuel the struggle
lindsey just put the thing on and shut up no
now be logical bud youre theyre both right up against the ceiling water up to their chests
lindseys lips are blue and trembling from the cold
will you listen to me for a second
youre for the suit on and youre a better swimmer than me
so i got a plan
whats the plan
i drown you tow me back to the rig lindseys gut scared
shaking violently her eyes wide
but shes keeping it together
thinking it out
bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her and he can barely think
look this water is only a couple degrees above freezing
i go into deep hypothermia
my blood like icewater
i can maybe be revived after ten fifteen minutes
you got all the stuff to do it on the rig
bud stops moving and looks into her face inches from him
the water is up to their necks
he knows that as always infuriatingly lindsey is right
it is insane
its the only way bud
now trust me
she takes a deep breath
before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his suit rehooking everything
jesus i dont believe this is happening
she raise his helmet
water up to their chins
they lock eyes inches apart
he can feel her breath on his face
maybe for the last time
oh god lins
i tell me later
he grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his
they lock together in a fierce kiss fueled by passion and terror
the naked realization of love hanging over the abyss of death
she breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet over his head
seats is down over the neck ring
lock the bail out handle sealing it
even with her head press up into the highest point of the ceiling lindseys mouth is barely above water
she give a scared little laugh
this is maybe not such a great plan is it
she is half paralyzed with the cold shaking pathetically
puts her face to the glass of his helmet
seconds to go
hold me bud
im so scared
he cant hear her but he read her lips
they clutch each other desperately
the embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose
she starts to choke
her hands grip his shoulders like claws
she bucks and thrashes
bud holds her and a scream tears loose from him a pure agony of the soul
the freezing seawater races into her lungs
her finger go slack and her hands float lifelessly
bud stares transfixed as the last tiny bubble trickles out of lindseys open mouth
he kicks himself into gear fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of the lockout hatch
tight on video screen one of the outside cameras
a ghostly figure swims out of the darkness towing something
oh my god
faint deepcore deepcore do you read
read you bud
bud swims with long powerful kicks towing lindsey
her arms and legs float as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current
buds voice comes in short rasps breathing hard but icy with control
go to the infirmary
get the cart
de fib kit
adrenaline in a
ten cc syringe
you got all that
meet me in the moonpool
the door crashes open and jammer thunders in
he picks up the cpr cart meant to roll on wheels and carries it out past hippy catfish and one night who are crowding in to get the rest of
they ransack the place in about ten seconds grabbing everything they might need and half of everything else
bud moves up toward the rectangle of light towing lindsey to the diving platform
through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge looking down
hippy and catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit dropping things making mistakes
one night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a bottle of adrenaline
here he comes
jammer and sonny leap into the freezing water waist deep on the submerged diving platform
bud bursts to the surface
together they haul lindsey across the platform out of the water and onto the deck
her skin is blue white her chest still
bud rips his helmet off in a near frenzy like a man possessed a man with a mission
the others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see lindsey as dead a corpse
cold and inert
water flows from her mouth and nose and her lips are blue her limbs completely limp
hippy peels back one eyelid to find the pupil fixed and dilated
but when bud shouts for them to move they move
turn her over
they flip his wifes body over
he straddles her pushing down with both hands in the middle of her back
seawater gushes from her slack lips
he does it again until the flow stops then flips her onto her back
come on hurry
gimme the de fib
one night and catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment
theyve all been trained in cpr and use of the gear but that was years ago and is a friend theyre working on
theyre all thumbs
catfish drops the electrodes picks them up quickly hands them to bud
here here here
no you got to have bare skin or it wont
bud rips into her clothing opening her jumpsuit literally tearing away her t shirt revealing her bare chest
bony and still
gimme those come on
catfish move it man
he slaps the things into lindseys bare skin one on the sternum and one on the side of the rib cage
is that it
is this right
i mean i dont know
it looks right
one night hits the switch and lindseys body convulses
it is a pure muscle reflex and when it is over there is not a hint of life
hippy pushes him back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth
he opens the valve on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag
they start packing electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia do it again one night
zap her again
the current hits lindsey again and her back arches
bud doesnt wait for a result
hes in his own reality now driven
hes doing it all at once somehow in a senseless frenzy
pumping on her chest with his hands squeezing the oxygen bag placing the electrodes
come on baby
do it again
lindseys back arches
her body relaxes inert
come on one night
what are you waiting for
a hush seems to have fallen over the group
they know instinctively that its over
but bud cant accept it
he looks at them beseechingly like they are somehow intentionally holding out on him
one night starts to cry quietly
gently bud its over man
there is a beat of silence
bud stares down into lindseys half open motionless eyes
tight on lindseys eyes moving in until the pupil fills frame a black void
reverse her pov
a distant distorted image we see bud one night jammer hippy catfish staring down
it is like the circular top of a dark well their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water
it is as if we are in a well descending looking up at a circle of faces growing smaller as we drop away
smaller and smaller receding until it becomes a point of light in the void like the fading bright dot at the center of a turned off tv
tight on bud rigid staring
catfish puts his hand gently on buds shoulder
suddenly bud tears catfishs hand away and sets upon lindsey like a madman renewing his efforts in spades
her heart is strong she wants to live
cant you see that
come on lins
come on baby
zap her again
and bud works feverishly
he lock his lips over hers and starts mouth to mouth
it is frantic passionate
the kiss of life
come on breath
goddamn it you bitch you never backed down from anything in life
he slaps her face hard
her head lolls
he smacks her the other way
lindseys pov from the bottom of the great well
the circles of faces and light rockets toward us in the blackness as we soar upward from the pit
we see bud yelling but his voice is distant windlike
tight on lindsey still
then something incredible happens
something they will never forget as long as they live
lindsey coughs once weakly and her hands clench in a spasm
bud see it and his expression becomes beatific
come on lins
you can do it
fight your way back baby
the others look on in wonder as bud wills this woman back
she starts to cough weakly at first
then more violently as she draws air into her lungs
bud crouches over her rubbing her limbs
trying to re establish circulation
it is like a difficult birth
lindsey comes hacking and howling back into the world wet and naked and fighting for breath
bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized breath
he pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands and watches her breathe
color is returning to her skin as she lies there gasping weakly
one the group
catfish hippy one night jammer the others
theyre all grinning crying beaming
gazing at the miracle of her rebirth
tears are streaming down his face
a whisper fierce and harsh you did it ace
tight on lindsey sleeping peacefully
wider shows bud hovering over her attentive
they are alone in buds tiny cubicle
perhaps twenty minutes have passed
she is completely swaddles in blankets except for her face and looks like a waif
lindseys eyes flutter and open
the first thing she sees is bud bending over her
he cant help himself
the tears break again and roll down his cheeks
she seems terribly fragile but bright and aware
she smiles faintly
touches his cheek
big boys dont cry remember
hi tough guy
i guess it worked huh
course is worked
youre never wrong are you
how dyou feel
ive been better
next time its your turn okay
buds expression turn inexplicably grim
well you got that right
tight on buds eyes as monks fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet
wider reveals bud is wearing the seals deep suit
everybody is grouped around buckling and zipping
he is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing
monk on his stretcher is presiding
the resident expert
lindsey is wrapped in a blanket still looking wan and frail
she doesnt have the strength to resist buds will but shes trying
no bud no
she looks around at the others
sees their eyes
has her answer
he lowers the helmet over his head
catfish clamps it down
we see whats driving him
his sense of responsibility for these people for not being able to prevent this situation
he touches her cheek one last time
she sees his fingers are trembling
then he puts on the gloves
catifsh is strapping a keypad unit onto buds forearm
lindsey wants to scream
to stop this madness
bud muffled so ill hear you but i cant talk
the fluid prevents your larynx from making sound
itll feel a little strange
bud muffled warning you now folks im a lousy typist
a beat the moment of truth huh
his breathing is shallow and tense
he looks at lindsey
the eyes of a condemned man
she squeezes his hand
he takes a deep breath
lets rock and roll
monk gently cracks a valve on the suits feed line
the breathing fluid m fluorocarbon emulsion fx swirls into the helmet
bud reflexively raises his chin
the liquid fills toward his mouth
relax now bud
just keep breathing as it fills
dont fight it
take it in
just let yourself take it in
suddenly theres nothing in there to breathe but liquid
his eyes go wide instant panic
he starts to thrash
this is normal
itll pass in a second
youre gonna be okay
we all breathe liquid for nine months bud
your body will remember
lindsey grabs buds shoulders steadying him
he finds her eyes the look calming him
hes passed into a realm from which she has already returned
his spasms subside
he begins to breathe normally
he gets a goofy look of wonder on his face not really believing what hes experiencing
he is alive alert and quite completely drowned inside the fbs helmet
gives a big thumbs up
lindsey picks up a microphone
can you hear me okay
another thumbs up try your keypad
bud taps out a brief message
feels weird you should try this prints out on their portable monitor
i already have moron
they help bud to the edge of the dive platform
jammer and hippy lower little geek into the water and bud grabs onto it
hippy yells right up next to his helmet
i redid little geeks chip the same as big geek
he should take you right to it
all you gotta do is hang on
lindsey crouches at the edge to watch bud submerge
he looks up at her as he drops away
in a few seconds she cant see him
her chin quivers minutely
from far below deepcore is a faint tiara of lights above in the blackness
a single moving light appears above at the edge of the cliff and starts down
it grows large resolving into bud free falling down the wall
he gathers speed as little geeks vertical thruster drives them down
bud looks down
between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the glow of his single light and beyond that an unfathomable blackness
the wall unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery
he looks up
the lights of deepcore are gone
he feels more alone than he has ever felt
he types out cant see you were right here with you bud
your depth is feet
youre doing fine
bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane hanging against the wall like a forty ton yo yo at the end of the umbilical
everyone is grouped around the monitor screen watching buds telemetry
bud types out good deal on slightly used crane
they watch the depth meter counting down
bud according to monk here you just set a record for the deepest suit dive
bet you didnt think youd be doing this when you got up this morning
the screen print out call guiness
so far so good
one mile down and still grinnin
bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little pool of light
the wall is sterile brown gray devoid of life at this depth
looking down as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness yawning below
lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly and the lightness in her voice is a bit brittle
ask him a pressure effects
tremors vision problems euphoria
ensign monk want to know how you feel
on the screen printing out cold
then hands shaking
hhard to type
it hits the nervous system first
keep talking lindsey
just let him hear your voice
it doesnt matter what about
dont forget bud youre being graded on spelling as well as sentence structure so concentrate okay
long pause bud i
uh theres some things i want to say
its hard for me
im not of those softy gooey center type people
its not easy you know being a cast iron bitch
it takes discipline and years of training
a lot of people dont appreciate that
lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room
in her mind she is with bud out in the darkness
but is wasnt all bad
i know that
you remember that bike trip
we rode the honda up through oregon
it took me a week to get my hair untangled but ive never been happier
it was the most
ive ever felt
im sorry i cant tell you these things to your face
bud is visibly trembling gritting his teeth
holding on as the vise grip of pressure takes him
filtered its pitiful
i have to wait until youre freezing in the dark and theres ten thousand feet of water between us
i guess im babbling
bud struggles with his keyboard
somehows shes smiling and on the verge of tears at the same time
two miles down and still grinnin comin up on the big ten thou
bottoms still a mile and a half down
bud jerks as his dive light implodes
he still has geeks floodlights
he falls on
jesus i dont believe hes doing this
shut up hippy
bud how you doing
he types se luminus thinngs everyone snaps suddenly alert
what kind of luminous things bud
the screen prints out its ok
bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid graceful attenuated creatures less than a foot long
thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs around him filling the black void as far as the eye can see
he stares at them in wonder
reaches out and touches one catches it lets it go
are they really here
he can no longer be sure of his own perceptions
another message from bud think theyr real
hes losing it
talk to him
keep him with us
bud its the pressure
try to concentrate
concentrate on my voice
just listen to my voice
bud emerges from the school of squid
as he falls they form a luminous plane of swirling colors above him
he stares upwards transfixed
buds pov the ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him
a spectral form takes shape in the patternless glow
resolving into lindseys face a hundred feet wide
gazing down at him her expression sad
her image receded away from him into the darkness above as he falls
down angle on bud reaching up in anguish
lindsey watches as bud haltingly types out your going away im not going away bud
im right here right here with you
this is lindsey bud
im right here
were losing juice
kill everything we dont need
catfish knock out those lights
everyone hustles to comply
the room is plunged into darkness the faces of the group lit only by the ghostly crt screen
run it through the digital processor cook it as much as you can
seventeen thousand feet
good christ almighty this is insane
bud is shaking violently as if with palsy
his eyes keep rolling back and hes having a hard time staying conscious
he tries to type a message and he cant
the tons of pressure per square inch are short circuiting his nervous system
suddenly k bam
little geeks pressure hull implodes
its lights go out
little geek just folded
bye little buddy
he can still make it
i know how alone you feel
alone in all that cold blackness
but im there in the dark with you bud youre not alone
lindsey seems not to be in the room but to be with him seeing what he sees
she is oblivious to the others
then a bright light appears
hes lit a magnesium flare
its fierce flickering glare lights his plunge
bud discards the stalwart little rov and free falls like a skydiver without a chute
out of control he hits a ledge and rolls off
tumbles forward in a cloud of debris
he hits another outcropping limp as a rag doll
rocks and sand rain down with him as he continues his descent
bud us quivering teeth locked in a titanic rigor
he pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position
in the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle returned to the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the
world of air and light
still there is lindseys voice faintly in his helmet
you remember that time you were pretty drunk you probably dont remember
the power went out at the old apartment the one on orange street
and we were staring at that one little candle and i said something really dumb like that candle is me like every one of us is out there alone in
the dark in this life
tight on lindsey as she grips the microphone
her voice has become a hoarse whisper
her eyes are intense focused on a point far beyond the walls of the room
and you lit another candle and put it beside mine and said thats me
and we stared at the two candles and then we
well if you remember any of it im sure you remember the next part
bud there are two candles in the dark
im with you
ill always be with you
a tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall
bud falls on in dream like solitude a candle in the dark
catfish gently takes the microphone from lindseys hands and leans close
how you doin podner
still with us come back
talk to us buddy boy
they watch the screen expectantly
hippy and one night start checking the equipment
lindsey tried unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice
you hangin in there
talk to me bud
are you okay
there is an agonizing pause then the letters appear slowly shaking stoped
what kind of light
hes hallucinating badly
bud is no longer in pain
his expression is rapt
looking down past his to a ghostly landscape
his last flare sputters out but there is light
bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him
and hes right
it is beautiful
the water is so clear we can see down feet past buds tiny silhouetted figure to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels
barren as the moon but exquisite serene
a place unseen by human eyes
like a firefly below the lights of big geek are visible
bud descends toward the rov which has grounded on a narrow shelf
below the shelf the wall slopes out suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but cant see it
one big geek mirv sitting there like a dumbshit
buds feet thump into the sediment next to it stirring it luminous particles
three and half miles of water over his head
bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of fireflies
at geek prints out
monk takes the headset gently from lindsey
okay bud well go step by step
take the cover plate off the firing box
a long pause
plate off all right bud you have to cut the ground wire not the lead wire
bud is peering into the detonator unit
how bad is he
we cant tell
its the blue wire with the white stripe not
not the black wire with the yellow stripe
bud is staring
the two wire look big as sewer pipes and theyre miles away
way down there where his hands are
the only light he has left is a cyalume stick
he pulls out the little plastic tube
breaks and shakes
it starts to glow a tiny wand of green light
he fumbles with his tool pouch takes out a pair of side cutters
cuting nnow he types to them
he reaches into the detonator
detail the wires
in the green cyalume glow the look identical
the cutters go over on wire
a long beat
they withdraw then go over the other wire
he cuts everyone is frozen
its very quiet
would we see the flash
through three miles of water
i dont know
theyre holding their breaths
still here a cheer goes up
save you air goddamnit
bud give me a reading off you liquid oxygen gauge
ten minutes worth id say
lindsey does white
it took him over an hour to get down there its hopeless
lindsey grabs the headset from monk
drop you weights and start back now
the gauge could be wrong
bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead
his expression is enigmatic
he looks around slowly at the luminous canyon
starts to type
the message comes in no
think ill stay a while
you can make it
you hear me
drop your weights
can breathe shallow
it could be wrong lindseys voice has twisted into a sob
she begins to weep quietly
oh god virgil please
then the words
lindsey sobs at the mike
the others look away
the signal is weakening
one night boosts it and the screen clears briefly
she stares at the printout
there is no reply
a tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert rov an indian dying with his horse in the desert
buds eyelids close
his chest barely moving
a strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open
weakly he raises his head facing the source of the radiance
a glowing figure hovers before him like a vision
it seems to be an angel
seen closer as it drifts toward him we see that it is an extraterrestrial being bioluminescent like some deep sea fish
its body and limbs are transparent and it resembles a figure made of blown glass
a delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona which pulsates gently propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a spanish dancer
the head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic with large eyes that convey a cold dispassionate wisdom
it is stunningly beautiful
the creature settles toward him
unafraid bud extends his hand
its slender blown glass digits grasp his bulky glove
it pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope deeper into the abyss
at the limits of visibility we see faint glowing forms moving below
they resolve into nti ships
tiny ovoids like the little scoutship that lindsey nearly collided with at the montana wreck
the larger manta ships
and others strangely configured moving in the darkness below like luminous fish
suddenly the darkness explodes with light
a vast reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines like some enormous circuit diagram appears below them covering the floor of the abyssal trench
it sweeps outward from the center as if the light were surging through channels
the ntis are revealing their home to bud
the ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city
bud and the creature descend until between the lines of light we see a dark surface of inhuman design
the shape extends beyond the limits of visibility
towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface
it dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it approaching an opening that soon yawns like a vast mouth
they are picking up speed swept along by a powerful current into the mouth like opening
bud stares around in awe as smooth pearlescent walls blur past him
it is a curving three dimensional maze of tunnels like a vast circulatory system where controlled currents of water become freeways in three dimensional space
tunnels divide narrow and reenter main routes hundreds of feet across as the pair race through in a dizzying blur
entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor and the nti moves back a few feet
a shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the chamber
the seawater divides like the red sea into two rippling walls
they move apart
leaving bud standing in a short shimmering hallway
weakly he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free
drops to his knees
doubles over as spasms wrack him
breathing fluid explodes from his lungs
he lies gasping and coughing on the floor dragging in deep breaths of what he can only hope is air
bud slowly recovers sitting up
his head is clearing
this really is happening
beyond the shimmering vertical surface of the water he sees the nti being joined by others move or less identical until a group of seven is gathered watching him
how you guys doin
his voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber
soft laps of water from the walls
in the air a pattern of glowing lines appears a series of what appears to be circuit diagrams
bud staggers back from this strange screen hanging in mid air
the image is about twenty feet across
there is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into
the face of dan rather doing the evening news
static then another newscast
fragments of the same story
the world on the brink of war
you watch out tv
that what youre trying to say
that you know whats been going on up there
the ntis are impassive
then another newscast
this time were allowed to focus on the story
an on the scene interview outside a high tech seismology lab
there is an air of hysteria about the scene
technicians running across the background of the shot people shouting the reporter jamming his mike at the harried looking scientist
a caltech scientist who is among those reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the worlds oceans
breg can you give us a clearer explanation then were getting
berg is edgy and distracted
people keeps handing him pieces of paper computer hardcopy
the biggest thing in his life is happening
theyre acoustic shockwaves like tsunamis but with no seismological source
the waves are propagating toward the shorelines of every continent an assistant runs up face shiny with fear beckoning
we see that berg is running scared
the impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational mind
ill be right there
i have to go
look we dont know what it is
not the slightest goddamn idea
the image dissolves into static fades out
bud turns to the ntis
youre doing it
thats what youre telling me
yeah you can control water
thats your technology
static again then a brilliant flash
grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb test in the pacific
the film repeats and then again faster and again until is merges into an unbroken white glare
bud gets the message
hey you dont know theyre really gonna do it
where do you get off passing judgment on us when you cant be sure
how do you know
the screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images stark moments from recent history
us soldiers fighting in vietnam street warfare in beirut a car bomb in belfast a suspect shot in the head in the streets of saigon burned and bleeding children grainy
footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at auschwitz wermacht soldiers marching in goose step review a year old contra with an ak
just glimpses strobing
a few frames of each
the images continue
hold on bud as the lights flicker on his face the ongoing indictment of humanity
a video news crew leaps from a jet ranger helicopter in a parking area and runs to set up near the railing facing the ocean
pandemonium reigns around them people running driving evacuating inland
on the horizon out to sea a dark line has appeared
it grows in height as it comes closer a wall of water stretching across the horizon already hundreds of feet high and growing
long lense shot looking seaward past the statue of liberty out past the verazzano narrows
stacked up by perspective the distant wave is a wall of water impossibly high still miles out
the scene repeats on the eastern coast of the kamchatka penninsula in russia where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave
sirens wail as russian sailors run from the docks of petropavlovsk naval base
some stand rooted as the black glacier of water a thousand feet high and growing thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion
the minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly faltering with emotion his voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the hindenburg disaster
the horizon has gone dark
the crowd is starting to run
some are just staring unable to move
the wave is
i dont know
maybe a thousand feet high already
getting bigger as im watching
still miles out
oh my god jesus
i can hear it
a roar fills the air a thunder which drowns out the peoples screams even the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard
they leave the announcer standing transfixed his face blank eyes tracking upward and upward as the ground begins to shake
the statue of liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is blocked out by the cresting tsunami an escarpment of water feet tall
long lens shot the golden gate bridge and the hills of the city the buildings downtown
beyond filling frame is the wall of sea green which defies our comprehension
the image shakes with the thunder
a diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which transcends his worst nightmare
he lies paralyzed on his board
downtown miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith
in a penthouse office suite an executive watches the wave towering above him blocking out the sun a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over about to break
upon the teeming city
the wave slows as it crests
feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its surface in the bright sun
there is quiet a faint wind and calling of confused gulls
various reactions as the thunder fades and people recover only to stand awed before the vast inexplicable manifestation
a news helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly
the surfer just blinks starting
on the east coast its the same as the world trade centers are dwarfed by a shimmering blue wall which stands
russian seamen lining the harbor breakwall at petropavlovsk naval base on the kamchatka peninsula stare upward at the monolith of water undulating in the moonlight
it seems poised to crash down inflicting inconceivable devastation
but it doesnt
when all have seen
the wave soundlessly subsides slowly slipping back and down until the surface of the sea is normal again
video shot handheld of a crowd of people watching the sea
moving from face to face
various reactions as people respond to what they can only understand as a miracle
awed stunned tear streaked
the cameraman is just walking
some people turn to him and smile or laugh or whoop
a woman is collapsed on a bench crying
a man is on his knees shaking
total strangers hug each other
a black guy tears pouring down his face turns to the camera with a beautific grin
somebody just laid it down to us man
things aint never gonna be the same
pull back to reveal that we are in the
bud sits shaken watching the screen as people react to their deliverance
he turns to the ntis
you couldve done it
why didnt you
the screen darkens
then letters appears on it slowly printing out as if someone was clumsily typing them
and weve seen this before so we know the rest
a pause then the last message expands to fill the entire screen
bud stares at the screen at his message of self sacrifice then at the aliens
they bow their heads just for a moment
a sign of respect
close on bud as he begins to realize what has happened
lindsey is slumped in a chair just staring
the others are conserving oxygen and heat huddling in the dark
the air is looking pretty thick
the speaker of the hydrophone transceiver crackles to life
deepcore do you read
this is benthic explorer over
hell yes we read
good of you to join us
hows that storm doin
well its strange
it just kindve blew itself out all of the sudden
were up here in a flat sea with no wind
but then a lot of weird thingsve been happening
well hell son
you better get us a line down here were in moderately poor shape
later hippy catfish and monk are conferring b
on how to get a new umbilical hooked on
one night is talking to mcbride on the hydrophone
they figure is was over a half mile high
i wish i could have seen it she glances down at the telemetry screen seeing movement
lindsey bolts to the screen
stares at the message printing out
a huge grin wraps around her face
no its not
whats it say
lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen
during the message her voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder to a childlike joy
lindsey grins as she reads the next part
id say thats a big jack
beyond the windows the ocean is calm
the sky steel gray put placid
mcbride turns to commodore demarco and the navy contingent his eyebrows cocked
looks like you boys might by out of business
somethings going on down there
im getting some big readings
bendix is hunched over the sonar and we can see the screens lit up like a wurlitzer
in deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling
the sonar is going crazy
one night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to her ear then jerks it away
whatever this is its major
the rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water
the glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the viewport bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance
a last message appears on the screen the radiance intensifies
everyone covers their eyes
it flares to bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts
all their instruments are pegged
active is pinging back something big
coming up right under us
looks out the window over there
a depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off not swirling down like a whirlpool just dimpling down
it gets wider
rapidly becomes a yawning pit
the ocean is opening
now the surface is churned by turbulence
slow massive roils of tremendous power boil up from the depths
mcbride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better
the open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across
the ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom
something rises in the center of the opening
a massive spire
smoothly curving and iridescent
off the starboard beam a quarter mile away another spire rises
tons of seawater fall from its sides with a thunderous roar the energy of niagara
off the port bow
and another beyond the destroyer albany dwarfing it
plus one larger in the center
one the explorers deck a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out the sun
the air the sea the deck
all vibrate with the thunder of and now for the payoff shot were high looking down
the spires form a it surfaces with slow majesty gently beaching all the ships on its broad back
we recognize it as the structure into which bud was led by the angelic being which we assumed was a city
the explorer rocks gently on its flat hull clunking massively to one side as it settles
the bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of the vast slightly curved hull
the missile cruiser rocks back and forth nearby high and dry
its prop whining futility
on explorers deck mcbride bendix demarco the rest of the navy contingent
theyre all standing there open mouthed in a dream like daze
touched by the hand of god
what they see fifty yards away between them and the albany sits deepcore two
it looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy sitting on the glistening plain of the nti arks hull
closer on trimodule c as the hatch at the bottom opens
catfishs feet appear bicycling
he swings down to the pearlescent deck
stands there blinking in the sunlight mole like
jammer plonks down behind him
he turns lifts lindsey down
hippy sonny and the rest emerge into the light of the sun
a deliverance from the blackest night they will ever know
we should be dead
we didnt decompress
out blood oughta be fizzin like a warm shook up coke
they mustve done something to us
lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks
for the sun for life for their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened an epiphany for the whole human race
i think you could say that
seeing something not far away
she gives a little laugh or something between laughing and crying
reverse as bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth like enterances to the nti structure
his suit is casually unzipped and the fbs helmet dangles from one hand jauntily
she starts toward him
breaks into a run
then stops a few feet from him
watching him come to her
his smile his eyes illuminating her
he stops and she touches him lightly
is this real
the look at each other wonderingly a moment
she sniffs loudly
their lips meet
