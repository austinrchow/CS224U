written by agnieska wojtowicz vosloo we hear a man gasping softly
a luminous pale shape slowly forms out of the searing whiteness
gradually we realize were moving across the alabaster body of a woman
her skin translucent
her eyes closed
her face lifeless
her eyes open
she looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes
this is anna late s
we pull back
paul s makes love to anna
their movements perfunctory
he turns to look at her
realizes shes not there
he suddenly stops
rolls off her
sits on the edge of the bed
anna leans down and picks up her red slip from the floor
you used to enjoy it
he shakes his head
lights a cigarette
its like fucking a corpse
paul immediately realizes hes gone too far
turns to anna
that was anna gets out of bed
walks towards the bathroom
paul puts his head in his hands
through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of anna
paul walks in
that was a stupid thing to say
but you know sometimes
sometimes its like youre not here anymore
like youre somewhere else
anna doesnt reply
is this about us
her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her
its not about us
then what is it
i dont know
i just want us to be happy
anna doesnt move
we sense the emptiness inside her
are you happy
she closes her eyes
forces herself to reply
falls into the water
then another drop
her nose is bleeding
she touches her lips
looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips
the sound of water carries into the next scene
a mans hands penetrate the water
thin and elegant
turning slowly as he washes them meticulously
he picks up a crisply folded white towel
dries his hands carefully
snaps on white latex gloves
a beautiful morning
we move through a tranquil cemetery
pastoral and idyllic
dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels
a path leads to an old well kept house
amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign eliot deane
sun streams into an elegant wood panelled room
the funeral director eliot deane s guides mrs
ayres s past caskets tastefully arranged on faux marble pedestals
hes a serene man
quiet and professional
the antique carlisle
strokes the wood lovingly hand rubbed satin finish
tufted sovereign interior
eternal rest adjustable mattress with matching pillow
he gestures to a metal casket
or perhaps the aegean
solid bronze exterior
hand brushed finish with grecian bronze highlights
the antique carlisle
definitely the antique carlisle
writes in his notebook excellent choice
ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming
an antique coffin for an antique lady
we suit each other
youll look beautiful
now about the service
would you like a private visitation
ayres is miles away
a private visitation
what happens when we die
eliot chooses his words carefully
its different every time
each person dies in their own way
anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town in a green toyota
on the dashboard a kitschy bobblehead doll nods its head from side to side
anna pulls up to a red light
glances across at the other cars
we see the vacant faces of commuters staring blankly into space
the light changes
anna hasnt noticed
the car behind her honks in frustration
she quickly pulls out
just as a suv turns in front of her
she slams on her brakes
missing the suv by inches
the driver screams at her
his face contorted in ugly rage
anna locks her car
heads towards the main building
classes have started
jack a serious looking boy walks through a silent corridor
up ahead two older boys a tall kid and a kid with acne push a geeky boy against a locker
jack tries to pass by unnoticed
jack walks faster
the two older boys set off after him
he darts into a corridor
ducks into an empty classroom
jack waits anxiously by the door
it looks like hes lost the bullies
then a sudden rustling noise makes him jump
tiny chicks huddle in a plastic incubator on a table
jack moves over to them
didnt you hear me jack off
jack swivels round
the tall kid walks towards him as the acne kid guards the door
jack doesnt reply
he must be deaf
you deaf jack off
jack ignores them
irritating the tall kid even more
cant fucking speak either
he pushes jack against the table toppling the incubator
panicked the chicks scatter across the surface
just then the door opens
anna walks in
whats going on
she glances at the older boys then at jack
nothing miss bryant
the incubator didnt just fall by itself
the older boys stare at jack
waiting for his reaction
it was an accident
anna looks at jack carefully
she knows hes lying
to the older boys shows over
get to your classes
help me clear up
jack doesnt hear her
hes mesmerized by a solitary chick standing motionless in the corner of the incubator
i think its dead
anna reaches in
tenderly picks up the chick
the poor things just scared
anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books
she cant focus
pulls out a bottle of pills
shakes a pill into her hand
swallows it dry
paul works with half a dozen colleagues around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files
he reaches across to a pizza box
who took the last pepperoni
a preppy guy slides across another pizza box
lifts out a slice who the fuck ordered broccoli
neal a thin pallid guy looks up
oh thats just disgusting
whats wrong with vegetarian pizza
pizza isnt supposed to be healthy
paul glances at his watch
suddenly realizes the time
he quickly picks up his cell phone
heads for the door
you ordering in another pizza
with wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts
paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone
annas cell phone rings as she closes her locker
she fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door
checks the id
then takes the call
paul cups his cell
worried hell be overheard
im really sorry about this morning
i fucked up
anna steps into an empty corridor
we still on for tonight
i dont know paul
we sense hes hiding something
it took me weeks to get the table
maybe we can change it to thursday no
it has to be tonight
whats the matter
paul tries hard to cover his nervousness
forces a smile
i just need
i just want us to have dinner tonight
despite pauls reassurances anna is clearly worried now
lowers his voice
everythings going to be fine
anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks through the deserted corridor
her high heels echo loudly in the eerie quietness
suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her blows out with a loud whumph
the next light dies
anna quickens her step
the lights go off one by one
the darkness quickly creeping up behind her
theres only one light still on as she reaches the exit
she looks up
the light flickers
but then strangely stays on
bathing her in a cold pool of light
she turns and frantically pushes the door
it doesnt open
she pushes hard with both hands
she turns back slowly
the darkness around her impenetrable
she reaches out
her hand disappears into the thick blackness
anna snatches her hand back
stares at it
then we hear the sound of slow footsteps
moving deliberately towards her
her voice echoes down the silent corridor
she glimpses something move in the blackness
is someone there
a black shape materializes inside the darkness
anna cant move
suddenly the corridors flooded with a blinding white light
shades her eyes with her hand
as she tentatively pulls her hand away
its only jack
his hand on the light switch
did i scare you miss bryant
jack moves over to the door
he gently pushes against the door
the door slowly opens
anna still shaken walks with jack towards the parking lot
shouldnt you be home
my moms picking me up
its my birthday
were going to macdonalds
then on saturday my moms taking me to busch gardens
were going to ride the alpengeist
continually voted one of the top ten roller coaster rides in america the alpengeist is a breathtaking avalanche of adventure
tries to keep a straight face i didnt know the park was open yet
my moms friends with the manager
theyre opening it specially for me
she knows hes lying again
sounds like fun
it will be fun
they reach annas car
stand in silence for a moment
do they bother you a lot
then slowly nods his head
you know you can always talk to me about it if you want to
annas clearly worried about him
you sure you dont need a ride
jack shakes his head
anna glances at her watch
i better run
where are you going
i have to go to a funeral
my old piano teacher
with sudden interest can i come
funerals are very private affairs
ive never been to a funeral
it wouldnt be appropriate jack
anyway wouldnt your mom worry about you
im sure she would
ill see you tomorrow in class
have a wonderful birthday
jack nods disappointed
anna watches him walk away then gets in her car
anna slips her key into the ignition
loud music suddenly blares from the car radio
she switches it off
squeezes the bridge of her nose
she pulls out a bottle of pills from her bag
she rummages in the glove compartment
finds another bottle
jack sits on the bench
watches anna drive away
then unzips his backpack
something moves inside
a strange jerky movement
jack closes the backpack
glances up and down the empty street
then walks away on his own
anna steps out of the pharmacy
as she washes down a pill with a bottle of water she notices a small hair salon
looks critically at herself in the pharmacy window
anna moves over to the salon
reaches for the door handle
shes about to walk away when the salon door suddenly opens
anna smiles shyly as a freshly coiffured woman politely holds the door for her
anna leans back against a washbasin
her neck tightly cradled against the white porcelain
the lights harsh and not particularly flattering
she closes her eyes
behind her the hands of a hairdresser in latex gloves begin to rinse dye from annas hair
a stream of water flows into the sink
then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually turns a deep crimson red
anna closes the front door behind her
she smiles as she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror
her hair a dark vibrant red
just then from another room we hear an old womans hacking cough
is that you
annas mother beatrice s sits in bed knitting with swift violent precision
the bedside tables stacked with medication
shes clearly been bed ridden for some time
an electric wheelchair in the corner of the room
anna appears at the door
beatrice scrutinizes her for a second
then returns to her knitting
anna moves to the beside table
picks up a dirty plate
can i get you something to eat
im not hungry
you have to eat
i dont have to do anything
the doctor said the doctors an idiot
he doesnt know what hes talking about
trying hard not to let her mother provoke her
beatrice glances up
anna avoids her look
why did you do it
today of all days
what have i done wrong this time
anna goes to the window
draws back the curtains
youve forgotten havent you
no i havent forgotten
the service isnt till six
then youve got plenty of time to wash it out
you cant wash it out
then dye it back
you cant show up at the funeral looking like that
like some prostitute
i dont look dont argue with me
why are you constantly arguing with me
anna bites her tongue
heads to the door
where are you going
to do the washing up
the sheets need changing
they havent been changed in months
i changed them monday
anna goes to the cupboard
takes out clean sheets
you werent here monday
you never sleep at home anymore
what if something happened to me in the middle of the night
nothing is going to happen to you
fat lot of good she is
i wouldnt have to pay for a nurse if my only daughter wasnt living in sin with that lawyer of hers
doing god knows what
they always leave you in the end
just like your father thats enough mother
anna dumps the sheets on the bed
as she turns to leave beatrices hand darts out and grabs annas wrist
go and cry to paul
anna pulls herself free
moves to the door
go and bitch to paul about your mean old mother
a warm intimate room
rows of chairs filled with elderly mourners
eliot stands respectfully beside a casket
father graham s reads at a lectern
we have entrusted our brother james hutton to gods mercy in sure and
anna in a black dress walks quickly along the gravel driveway
stares out over the cemetery
certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord jesus christ who died and rose again for us
anna slips into the back of the room
eliot leads mrs
hutton s to the body of her husband james hutton s lying in the casket
hutton touches a bouquet of white roses by the casket
they were his favorite
how did you know
they just seemed appropriate somehow
he looks so peaceful
as if hes only sleeping
anna approaches mrs
she doesnt notice eliot watching her carefully
im so sorry
thank you anna
you were always his favorite student
anna smiles awkwardly
hows your mother
she sends her condolences
you look tired dear
but we can see in her eyes that everythings not fine
hutton nods then turns to greet another mourner
anna steps nervously up to the coffin
james hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming
suddenly his lips part
as he gasps softly
anna steps back terrified
stares at hutton
his face serene again
it must have been her imagination
she glances up quickly
eliots still observing her
he nods to her cordially
a spartan room at the top of the house
eliot carefully pins a polaroid of hutton lying in a coffin to the wall
next to huttons photograph we briefly glimpse the edge of another polaroid
eliot stares intently at huttons image for a moment then takes off his jacket and moves to the window
annas by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys
getting increasingly frustrated
anna suddenly looses it
angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway
she kneels down
grabs the keys
throws the rest of her things back into the bag
leans against the car
she looks weary
she glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears
black storm clouds gather on the horizon
anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand
pulls herself together
angry with herself
eliot watches intently as anna drives away
paul sits at a window table
its raining hard outside
he glances at his watch then nervously checks his pockets
pulls out a ring box
he looks at it for a moment then slips it back into his pocket
as he refills his glass anna appears outside holding her raincoat above her head
she stares at paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain
paul suddenly notices anna at the window
spills some of his red wine on his shirt
close on the red stain
it unfurls like a flower
spreading out over the white material
sorry about that
paul dabs the stain with a napkin
you scared the life out of me
anna laughs as she sits down
paul looks up at her
you dont like it
i didnt say that
its just very
i mean its not really you is it
a waiter appears at the table before anna can reply
are you ready to order
well have the duck
you always have the duck here
picks up the menu i dont always have the duck
pours anna some wine as she looks through the menu
the waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently
puts the menu aside
ill have the duck
paul smiles as the waiter leaves
anna tries to ignore him
but after a second she cant help smiling back
the duck is very good
annas smile broadens
the tension between them broken for the moment
paul reaches across
touches her hand
lets not argue tonight
anna takes a sip of wine
this is good
she picks up the bottle
checks the label
and looks very expensive
whats the special occasion
pauls momentarily thrown
he tries to cover it by rearranging his napkin
suddenly very serious actually there is something i need to talk to you about
now annas nervous
ive been offered a transfer to head office in chicago
anna looks down
stares at her hands on the table
itll mean more work of course
a lot of changes
but its an incredible opportunity
id be crazy to turn it down
well ive been thinking
maybe its time for us to
paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket
without looking up youre going to leave me
before he can say anything you couldve just told me this morning
you didnt need to buy me off with an expensive meal
paul reaches for her hand
anna gets up to leave
why did you lie to me
you promised everything was going to be ok
dont be ridiculous
youve got it all wrong
im not being ridiculous
why do you always talk to me like im a small child
as if talking to a small child anna
there you go again
do you know how irritating that is
cant we just have one fucking meal without arguing fuck you
the other diners turn and stare at them
paul glances at them embarrassed
anna doesnt notice
keep your voice down everyones watching
you know that
just like your mother
im nothing like my mother
anna grabs her coat
pushes her way through the restaurant
im not running after you this time anna
pauls suddenly aware that everyones looking at him
he quickly sits down
drains his glass of wine
anna closes the car door
its still raining hard outside
her hair perfect minutes ago is now bedraggled
her make ups running
she places her hands on the steering wheel
trying desperately to pull herself together
pauls at the car window
he thumps the glass again
anna hits the locks
paul grabs the door handle
open the door
i want you to come with me
i want to
anna cant hear him above the sound of the rain hammering onto the car
she shakes her head
puts the car in drive
paul stumbles aside as annas car pulls away
she stops at the parking lot exit a short distance away
anna looks up into the rearview mirror
paul stands forlornly in the rain
their eyes meet
for a moment we think she might go back to him
but then anna pulls out and drives away
leaving paul alone in the parking lot
the rain pounding the asphalt
anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers battle with the torrential downpour
a large truck plows past menacingly on the rain slicked highway
annas still upset
she wipes away her tears
on the dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to side
anna picks up her cell phone
glances down as she dials a number
she looks up
a white van with black tinted windows cuts in front of her
anna swerves into the next lane
we hear the blaring horn from the car behind her
into rear view mirror ok
i saw you
the cell phone connects
we hear pauls answering machine
you home yet
can you pick up
i just dont want it to end like this
anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat
wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass
a tractor trailer shudders past loaded with metal pipes
the badly loaded pipes bang ominously against each other
a bright light comes on
close on a mans hands
turning slowly under a stream of crystal blue water
we pull back
eliot dries his hands
opens a cabinet
takes out a pair of latex gloves
a large room
tall vaulted ceilings
soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall
the room is silent
like a chapel
in the semi darkness we see a body on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet
we hear a key turn in a lock
then another lock
the rooms suddenly flooded with a harsh white light
eliot steps inside the room
he takes off his jacket
carefully places it on a coat hanger
puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves
his every move meticulous
like a ritual
eliot walks over to the slab his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor
he looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing
pale and lifeless
an ugly gash above her eyebrow
cracked violet lips
a rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain
shes only wearing one shoe
eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist
places it inside a brown paper bag
eases off the shoe
picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley
delicately slices open her dress
peels it off
hes about to cut the straps of her red slip when
anna opens her eyes
she looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes
strangely eliots not surprised
he calmly steps back
watches her carefully
annas eyes slowly focus on eliot
where am i
she talks with difficulty
her breathe labored
youre in a funeral home
annas vacant eyes widen in shock
she struggles to sit up but she cant even raise her head
her body stiff
eliot speaks to her calmly
you had a car accident
it was raining
you hit a truck loaded with metal pipes
she looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in eliots hand
im not dead
you were pronounced dead eight hours ago
your blood no longer circulates through your body
your brain cells are slowly dying
your bodys already decomposing
im not dead
eliot looks at her sadly for a moment
he places the bloodied dress on the trolley
then picks up a document
holds it up for her
its annas death certificate
this is your death certificate
cause of death
massive internal trauma
time of death
you were dead on arrival
the attending physician signed here
points to document at
i picked up your body from the hospital morgue at
anna stares with horror at her death certificate then at eliot
he looks away
it pains him to see her so distressed
eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley
who are you
eliot delicately washes annas face
she doesnt flinch as he dabs the wound above her eye brow
dont touch me
why are you touching me
im preparing your body
you have to look beautiful for your funeral
im not dead
eliot sighs wearily
as if hed had this conversation many times before
you all say the same thing
maybe you should rest now
eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door
as he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and looks at anna for a moment
the lights go off
the door clicks shut as it locks automatically behind eliot
i cant be dead
its just a nightmare
ill wake up soon
paul wakes up
badly hung over
still in his clothes
sunlight streams into the room
he reaches across
the beds empty
hes surprised for a moment then remembers the argument the night before
he gets up
sits on the edge of the bed
lights a cigarette
he notices his jacket on the floor
as he pulls out the blackberry from his jacket the ring box falls onto the floor
paul doesnt notice
paul steps into the kitchen
nervously checking his blackberry
just then he sees the red light blinking on his answer machine
he presses play
you home yet
can you pick up
i just dont want it to end like this
he picks up the phone
we hear the ringing on the other end
two technicians an old guy and his young pale assistant push a naked body wrapped in plastic through the morgue
they jump as they hear the muffled sound of a cell phone
the ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on a table we recognize it as annas bag
the assistant walks over
takes out the cell phone
its the schoolteachers
from the car crash
should i answer it
the ringing stops abruptly
its suddenly very silent
someones in for a surprise
how many times do i have to tell you
you cant leave their stuff laying around
it shouldve been returned to the family
ive been busy ok
like shes really going to need her rollover minutes now
as the assistant reaches for the bag he notices a solitary shoe on the table
he picks it up
what shall i do with this
wheres the other one
the assistant looks round
he cant see the other shoe anywhere
he turns to the old guy and shrugs
just burn it
you cant send them back one shoe
its not respectful
we hear a beep
you got it all wrong baby
i want you to come to chicago with me
ill swing by your place on my way to the office
you know i love you
paul pulls up to a suburban house
walks quickly to the door a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in cellophane in his hand
he rings the bell
no one answers
he rings again
knocks hard on the door
still no answer
paul looks around
notices the driveways empty
he heads back to his car
pauls on his cell phone as he drives
he gets annas voice mail again
its me again
i must have just missed you at home
call me when you get this
paul strides down an empty corridor
the flowers in his hand
searching for annas classroom
a teacher stands in front of the class holding a shell
the shell grows slowly
the door opens
paul steps into the classroom
his smile fades as he realizes its not anna
im looking for anna bryant
the teacher quickly moves over
hustles paul to the door
im sorry but you just cant im annas
i thought this was her class
the teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand
we had a little misunderstanding last night
she didnt come in today
jacks in the front row
following the conversation
did she call in sick
she hasnt called in at all
its not like her
she always calls in
pauls worried now
anna lies rigidly on the slab
her head turned to one side
staring blankly at the wall
her eyes glazed
suddenly classical music fills the room
she moves her head with difficulty
nervously looks around
for a moment she doesnt know where she is
then she sees eliot by a cd player
she watches with trepidation as he approaches her
please dont hurt me
how can i hurt you
youre already dead
but im not dead
then why are you here
anna doesnt know what to say
she turns her head away
a tear falls down her cheek
just let me go
i wont go to the police
i wont tell anyone
eliot moves her head back
gently wipes away her tear
youre still in denial
you have to trust me
im only here to help you
eliot slides a wooden head rest under her neck and studies her wounds touching them delicately
thinking about how to conceal them
he turns to a tray of instruments
picks up a needle
leans over anna
the needle pierces her brow
sliding cleanly through her skin
she doesnt feel any pain as eliot carefully sews the wound
clearly very good at his job
eliot glances at his watch
picks up a syringe and an ampoule of amber liquid
draws up the amber liquid
she tries to pull back
dont be scared
what are you doing
this will relax your muscles
stop the rigor mortis setting in so i can work on your body
he injects anna in the neck
just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside
your mothers early
annas eyelids feel very heavy
slowly her eyes close
eliot pulls the white sheet over her body
a nurse diane s follows beatrice in her wheelchair as eliot leads them through the hallway
im so very sorry mrs
its always so tragic when you lose a child
i lost her years ago
he glances at her curiously
then gestures to his office
if youd care to come to my office we can discuss the arrangements
i want to see her
but she hasnt been i dont care
i want to see her
it takes him a second to respond
beatrice leans against the slab staring at annas covered body
eliot stands respectfully to one side
in the b
the rooms cold
beatrice touches annas hand through the white sheet
then uncovers annas face
the needles still embedded in her eyebrow
eliot quickly steps forward
pulls out the needle
cuts the thread with a pair of large scissors
as i said
ive only just started preparing her
whats the point of preserving the body if the souls already left
quietly to himself no
the soul never leaves
beatrice stares at anna
its us who are left behind
its us who suffer
whos going to look after me now
did you think about that
she nods to diane
diane helps her into the wheelchair
ill confirm the date with father graham this afternoon
friday as you requested
just do what you thinks best
its just details
beatrice whirs towards the door
she suddenly stops
turns to eliot
oh there is one thing
she was a brunette
id like it back to that color
eliot watches beatrices car drive away
paul waits in his car outside the mothers house
the wilting flowers on the passenger seat beside him
beatrices car pulls up
diane gets out
pulls the wheelchair out of the car
paul grabs the flowers
paul strides over as diane helps beatrice into her wheelchair
beatrice doesnt acknowledge him
paul turns to diane
i need to talk to anna
diane cant look him in the eye
i think you better come in
beatrice sits in her wheelchair with her back to the door
paul stops a short distance away
anna was in a car accident last night
my daughters dead
thats what happened
paul stares at beatrices back in disbelief
a car crash
beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face paul
i dont know
they said it happened just before
we were at the restaurant
beatrice glares at him
she clearly blames him for annas death
you shouldnt have let her drive in that weather
paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand
she cant be dead
there must be some mistake
theres no mistake
we just got back from the funeral home
beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair
as she whirs past paul she notices the flowers
pauls not listening anymore
why didnt you call me
you took her away from me
i dont want you anywhere near her
eliot turns on the taps
fills a copper kettle
a shuddering pipe bangs ominously
anna opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep
she stares at us
close on an exploding blue flame from a gas ring
we pull back
eliot places a kettle on the ring
then measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin into a teapot
meticulous in everything he does
close on annas hand
her fingers flex slightly
she pushes herself up awkwardly
suddenly realizes something
she touches her wrist
desperately searching for her pulse
then frantically checks her neck
she cant find her heartbeat
she stares at her hand
then abruptly slams it against the slab
she feels no pain
she does it again
i must be in shock
its just shock
she struggles to her feet
stumbles groggily to the door
tries the door handle
she bangs on the door feebly
then she hears something
she cocks her head
follows the sound of eliots footsteps upstairs
let me out
eliots by his desk
checking his appointment book
whistling softly to himself
we cant hear annas cries
he pours a cup of tea
adds a drop of milk
as he stirs his tea he hears the sound of feet crunching on the gravel outside
he glances out the window
paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly at the funeral home
eliot steps out of the funeral home
heads towards paul
can i help you
paul turns to him
pulled away from his thoughts
my names conran
holds out his hand
off pauls surprised look its a small town
in my line of work you get to know everyone eventually
as they shake eliot looks at pauls hand strangely
as if he senses something
im anna bryants fiancee
she wasnt wearing an engagement ring
well not quite fiancee
im very sorry for your loss mr
id like to see her
im afraid the viewing isnt until id need to see her now
if thats possible
its not possible
youre not family and please
itd only take a minute
but anna suddenly hears pauls loud voice outside
she frantically beats her fists against the door
paul quickly controls his anger
his eyes smart with tears
i tried to stop her
she didnt hear me
pauls voice breaks with emotion
he cant go on
eliot gently takes him by the elbow
leads him back to his car
there really is nothing i can do
im so sorry
paul looks defeated
he simply nods his head
eliot watches him get into his car and drive away
anna sits by the door in the darkness
suddenly the rooms flooded with light
eliot walks in
looks at anna for a moment
she just stares back at him coldly
he heads over to the sink
who was that
a long beat
it was paul
i heard you talking to him
why didnt you let him see me
amused she caught him out
he continues washing his hands
did you love him
anna looks up sharply
eliots clearly hit a nerve
thats none of your business
dries his hands on a white towel
you werent going to tell me paul was here were you
because it would only hurt you
you have to let go of the living
just like they have to let go of you
i dont believe you
why are you doing this to me
he shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin
youre all the same
you all blame me for your death
as if it were my fault
you drugged me
so my mother the others
they just see you as a dead body on a slab
only i can see you as you really are
eliots taken aback
im a busy man
i dont have time for this
he heads to the door
pulls out his keys and unlocks it
just then he remembers something
turns to her
oh i nearly forgot
how tall are you
he looks her up and down
gauging her height
i need to know how tall you are
for your coffin
eliot looks at her for a moment
then switches off the main lights
he ignores her
the door clicks shut behind him
eliot steps into the hallway
stops by a vase of flowers
he plucks a dead petal
curiously sniffs his fingers
then heads to the casket room
close on annas face
she looks empty
just then something catches her attention
the light from the window glints off a pair of large scissors on the steel trolley
anna stumbles to the trolley
feeling her way through the semi darkness
grabs the scissors
just then she notices a body covered with a white sheet lying on a gurney in the corner
she turns away
but then almost against her will she approaches the gurney
as if drawn to the body
she slowly pulls the sheet away
the dead body of an old woman
staring blindly at anna with cloudy opaque eyes
long greasy gray hair
shaken anna pushes herself against the wall
i dont want to die
jack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper
the loud sounds of a tv blare from another room
schoolteacher dies in tragic car crash
the curtains are drawn
jacks mother sits in an armchair with her back to us watching tv
jack walks in
you were supposed to pick me up from school yesterday
his mother doesnt reply
jack moves in front of the tv
his mother doesnt respond
jack furiously cycles through empty streets
past identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns
he stops suddenly
then turns and cycles away purposely
eliot walks out of the funeral home
we pull back
jack stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him
eliot looks up
as if sensing someone was spying on him
jack steps back quickly behind a tree
a police officer talks on the phone as paul walks in
hang on a sec
heard about your girlfriend
clearly doesnt want to talk about it
is tom in
the captain just stepped out
he wont be long
you can wait in his office if you want
ill just go and grab a coffee
as paul walks away the officer returns to the phone
a buddy of the captains
paul slides a dollar bill into a coffee machine
presses his selection
he pushes the button repeatedly
then angrily slams the side of the machine
you piece of shit
as paul turns away he notices a door with a sign on it authorized personnel only
paul glances around
then quickly walks over to the door
a dozen wrecked cars
pauls footsteps echo through the empty garage
out the corner of his eye paul glimpses a shape move quickly around a pillar
just then we hear a womans footsteps
her high heels clicking on the concrete floor
theres something strange about the sound
paul listens nervously
the footsteps grow fainter
then fade away
the garage is silent again
paul moves apprehensively over to annas green toyota
the cars a mess
one sides completely caved in
he touches the car
pulls open the door
squeezes into the drivers seat
paul glances at the kitschy bobblehead doll on the dashboard flecked with blood
he places his hands on the steering wheel
suddenly he hears a strange noise
he looks up
the kitschy doll
its head nodding slowly
its smiling face now unnaturally sinister
turning towards us until it abruptly stops
staring straight at us
paul looks at the doll transfixed
just then a pale womans hand slowly reaches through the window
and touches pauls shoulder
anna stands by the car
staring blankly at him
the color drains from pauls face
the police captain tom peterson stands by the car where anna was a second ago
he pulls his hand away from pauls shoulder
looks at him with concern
paul gathers his composure
he must have just imagined anna was there
he shoves the door open
hes about to step out when he turns back and grabs the kitschy doll
paul gets out awkwardly
he cant look tom in the eye
i just found out
im so sorry paul
if you need anything i need to see anna
what do you mean
the funeral director wont let me see her tom
he says im not family
can you talk to him
put some pressure on him
i cant do that
youre my friend
i cant do it
paul nods slowly
tom notices the kitschy doll
you sure youre ok
i fucked up
it was an accident
you should get some rest
let me drive you home
i always fuck everything up
eliot stops by a thermostat
studies it for a moment
turns it lower
he glances at his watch
takes out his keys from his jacket and moves over to the prep room door
anna sits on the slab
her hands behind her back
she carefully watches eliot as he pulls on his pale blue smock then walks over to a cabinet
her hands clutch the large scissors
eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women
as he prepares the dye he looks across at anna
shes staring at something behind him
sees the uncovered body of the old woman on the gurney
he quickly walks over
carefully pulls the white sheet over the old woman
who is she
he mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to anna
you shouldnt be afraid of her
the dead cant harm the dead
but im not dead
annas hand suddenly flies up
she slashes at eliots face with the scissors
the sharp edge misses his cheek by inches
eliot drops the bowl
stumbles back against the steel trolley
instruments crash to the floor
anna staggers to the door
her legs weak
her long lank hair falling over her eyes
she frantically wrenches at the door handle but its locked
eliot gets up
slowly moves towards anna
raises the scissors
stay where you are
holds out his hand give me the scissors
i only want to help you
dont come any closer
i swear to god ill kill you
eliot walks right up to her
his face now inches from hers
anna doesnt move
eliot looks her steadily in the eye
he reaches for her hand
he brings the scissors to his cheek
then lets go of annas hand
the sharp tip pushes into his skin
for a moment we think she might do it
but then she wavers
what are you waiting for
annas confidence falters
she slowly lowers her hand
the scissors fall onto the floor
anna looks down defeated
her breath labored
suddenly she realizes
raises her head look
im still alive
you think youre still alive because youre still attached to life
youre just imagining you still have symptoms of life
shes not listening
eliot takes a roll of paper towels
kneels down picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess
maybe i was in some kind of coma
the doctors made a mistake
theyre always making mistakes
how can i be dead if were talking
he stands up
were talking not because youre alive
but because i have a gift
i can talk to those between life and death
to help them make the transition
for the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind
is this what happens when you die
it depends on how you lived your life
what do you mean
not everyone needs my help
some let go as soon as their body dies
others dont let go until long after theyre in the grave
am i a ghost
is that why im here
youre here so i can bury you
trying to make sense of what shes just heard
eliot takes her arm
leads her to the slab
weve wasted enough time already
she lies down submissively
suddenly very tired
eliot leans over her to apply whats left of the dye
i dont want youre a corpse
your opinion doesnt count anymore
but i can breathe
i must be alive
she weakly pushes him away
anger flashes across eliots face but just as quickly he controls it
you all think that if you breathe shit piss youre alive
anna doesnt know what to say
you clutch onto life as if your life was worth clutching onto
was your life worth clutching onto anna
anna turns her head away
clearly hes struck a chord
maybe you died a long time ago
eliot rips off his latex gloves
tosses them into a bin
i have to tell you im surprised youre still arguing with me
you dont have much time left
gestures to the old women look
shes accepted her death
her life has been examined
she has no more regrets
and now shes at peace
she used her time well
you still have so much to learn
i have nothing to learn
are you sure
eliot stands in the doorway
he switches off the light
his body silhouetted by the light from the hallway
your funerals in three days
soon youll be enclosed in a coffin
then buried in the ground
no one will hear you then
no one will talk to you there
the door clicks shut behind him
anna doesnt move
clearly unsettled by eliots words
after a moment she looks at the old woman
she moves over
hesitantly pulls away the white sheet
stares at the old woman curiously
then tentatively touches her cheek
are you cold
she takes the old womans hand
strokes her paper thin skin
im so cold
anna notices the old womans plastic ankle tag
name carol whitehall
you had a long life
anna turns back
studies the old womans serene face
you look so peaceful
arent you scared
annas eyes fill with tears
im so scared
jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling
on his bedside table an alarm clock reads
he looks across at an anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open shoebox
he gets up
walks towards the muted light
the small chick huddles in the shoebox
it looks dead even though its eyes are open
jacks about to reach into the box
then changes his mind
he looks at the lamp
switches it off
after a moment he switches it back on again
paul stands motionless in the middle of the room
staring blankly into space
the room feels empty and depressing
he suddenly looks around
not quite sure why he came into the room in the first place
he moves over to a cd player
mechanically switches it on
music fills the room
he turns the volume higher
then all the way up
the musics unbearably loud but paul just stands there
the musics strangely distorted now
as if we were inside pauls head
anna lies on the slab
curled in a fetal position
we hear the unnaturally loud metallic drip of a faulty faucet
anna opens her eyes
stares at us
then she turns her head
the old woman sits on the other slab
slowly brushing her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush
anna looks around anxiously
the room is strangely larger
the perspective not quite right
certain objects look absurdly small or abnormally large
she notices a tiny door
half hidden by a steel trolley
the doors slightly ajar
the old woman shakes her head
staring blindly at anna with opaque eyes
anna ignores her
moves quickly to the tiny door
as she approaches the door seems to grow to normal size
then we realize its anna who has shrunk
the steel trolley now towers high above her
the massive instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects cast in surgical steel
she opens the door
revealing a solid wall of darkness
the small shape of anna in the doorway
the huge dark space engulfs her
the only light comes from the prep room behind her
anna reaches forward
her hand disappears into the thick blackness
she snatches her hand back
a childs hand darts out of the darkness
grabs annas wrist
pulling her in with surprising strength
anna struggles to free herself
but the hand drags her deeper into the darkness
the door slams shut behind her
anna stands in the black empty space
im disappointed with you
an innocent looking young girl materializes out of the blackness
she looks like a young anna
who are you
the young girl walks slowly towards anna
you promised me so many things
you dont recognize me
anna shakes her head
i am you
ive been waiting for you
you shouldnt have disappointed me
the girl now looks strangely malevolent
anna steps back terrified
but theres no door anymore
the old woman stands alone in the middle of the room
braiding her long hair
youre not ready
a small congregation of mourners sit in the white chairs
ave maria plays quietly in the b
a man leans over the casket paying his respects
the old woman
her long hair braided
she looks serene
ave maria filters into the room
anna opens her eyes
she gets up awkwardly
looks around the room
the other slabs empty
the old womans gone
anna stumbles over to the trolley
pushes it aside
desperately searching for the tiny door
she touches the wall
theres nothing there
frustrated she turns to a counter crowded with instruments
she sweeps her arm across the counter top in rage
sending everything crashing to the floor
the funerals over
eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of flowers from a vase
in the b
jack stands half hidden in the doorway
glancing around in fascination
a flower in his hand
to jack without looking up can i help you
jack steps back timidly
eliot looks up
then perhaps you can help me
holds up the withered flowers could you throw these away for me
jack nods hesitantly
moves over and takes the flowers
eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase
as he looks at the wilted flowers
he crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers
theres no life left in them
jack looks up
eliots watching him carefully
they belong in the garbage
jack turns to leave
ive seen you round here before
jacks suddenly nervous
did you know mrs
i thought it was miss bryants funeral
her funerals not until friday
where is she now
eliot considers the question for a moment
because shes not ready
is the flower for her
she was my teacher
and you are
jack holds out his hand
a serious look on his face
he shakes jacks hand
what did you think
did you find it interesting
it was ok i guess
are all funerals the same
theyre never the same
each one is special
the dead always speak to us in different ways
what do you mean
eliot finished arranging the flowers
he glances at his watch
smiles at jack
it was a pleasure talking to you jack
he watches eliot walk out of the room
as eliot heads to the prep room we hear a muffled crash from inside
eliot quickly pulls out his keys
moves to the door
just then eliot hears a creaking sound behind him
jacks at the top of the stairs
staring down curiously at the prep room door
eliot observes him cautiously
did jack hear the sound as well
jack looks back at eliot
then without a word turns and heads back up the stairs
anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room
hugging her legs to her chest
rocking to and fro
surrounded by broken glass torn papers and instruments
eliot enters the room
coldly surveys the destruction
why did you do this
anna ignores him
eliot strides over to her
anna stares at him blankly
is this the afterlife
am i in heaven
or am i in hell
strangely eliots not surprised
he nods his head
his anger gone now
there was a door
it wont be long now
i used to believe in god
i thought id see him when i died
instead i saw you
eliot softly strokes her hair
maybe you are god
youll be at peace soon
for a moment we see a deep sadness in eliots eyes
but then abruptly he pulls himself together
moves away and starts clearing up
anna closes her eyes
hugs her legs closer to her chest
she lets out a despondent sigh
the sigh carries into the next scene
the tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves
a sudden gust of wind bends the dense foliage
their leaves ripple
languid and fluid like a wave
the sound almost malevolent
pauls red rimmed eyes snap open
he lies on his bed fully clothed
an empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside table
behind him the curtains stir
the kitschy dolls head begins to slowly nod
turning towards us
we hear the eerie rustling sound again
like a murmuring whisper
paul turns quickly
sees the open window
its only the wind
it suddenly got very cold
he gets up and closes the window
the whispering starts again
this time from the bathroom
paul walks over to the bathroom door
as he touches the door handle
the whispering stops
the rooms strangely silent
he slowly opens the door
the bathrooms empty
paul looks around nervously
he catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror
leans wearily against the washbasin
water drips from a leaky pipe
the fluorescent bulb over the mirror crackles softly
paul turns on the taps
splashes cold water on his face
hes about to reach for a towel when he senses something
he cocks his head slightly
he turns and checks out the bathroom
paul dries his face
as he replaces the towel
the sound of dripping water abruptly stops
suddenly the shower starts running
pauls paralyzed with fear
steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor
he turns slowly towards the shower
anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him
she slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook
then her hand moves to her chest
theres a strange wet sucking sound
as anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe
dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles
anna turns slowly
her skins like alabaster
a bloody gash where her heart used to be
the steam from the shower curls around her like a mist
she looks hauntingly beautiful
a line of thick black fluid trickles from her nose
paul turns away
when he turns back a second later annas not there
the bathrooms empty
the showers not even running
jack opens the fridge
its almost empty
he takes out a carton of milk
recoils from the smell
from the living room we hear the loud sound of a tv
were out of milk
theres no reply
jack grabs his jacket
annas still sitting on the floor
the place is clean and ordered again
she watches eliot unzip a garment bag
he lifts out a plain black dress
its your dress
for your funeral
your mother brought it round this morning
as eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag anna moves haltingly over to the dress
she touches the material puzzled
this isnt my dress
realizes with shock this is my mothers dress
it was supposed to be for her funeral
why has she given it to me
eliot starts folding the plastic bag
he notices something else inside
he opens the bag
hesitates then takes something out
an old fashioned wooden rosary
eliot looks at it for a moment
then glances over at anna
shes still staring at the dress
he opens a drawer beneath the counter
its full of rosaries and printed holy cards
he quickly drops the rosary into the drawer
then turns back to anna
it should have been her not me
turns to eliot she was the one dying
eliot unlocks the door
jams it open with a door stop
slips his keys back into his jacket pocket
takes off his jacket and hangs it up
he moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor
bends down and snaps open the side rails
anna looks at the open door
im not ready to die
eliot looks up at anna sadly
why are you still struggling
im not ready to die
she glances at the open door again
eliot follows her look
theres nothing out there for you anymore
as eliot turns back to the gurney anna notices eliots jacket hanging beside her
realizes the keys are in the pocket
she quickly glances back at eliot
hes still busy adjusting the gurney
she leans over to his jacket
as he gets up and turns to anna
anna looks at him calmly
we cant tell if she managed to get his keys or not
eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door
he steps back into the room
nudges the door stop away with his foot
ill be back soon
the door locks behind him with a click
eliot pushes the gurney to a white van with black tinted windows note the same kind of van that cut in front of anna just before the accident
anna listens anxiously to the crunch of eliots feet on the gravel outside
after a moment she hears the van drive away
she unfurls her fist revealing eliots keys
as eliot slides in a cd he notices the fuel gauge
hes low on gas
he glances into his rear view mirror and makes a left turn
anna staggers to the door
theres at least a dozen keys
she frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock
begging the door to open please
it doesnt fit
she fumbles for another key
it almost fits
she forces it
the key snaps off loudly in the lock
anna looks around desperately
sees a tray of instruments on the steel trolley
she scrambles over
finds a pair of surgical pliers
she moves back to the door
eliot replaces the pump nozzle
walks over to the cashier
thirty four fifty
in the b
jack a carton of milk in his hand steps out of the gas station
eliot doesnt notice him as he pulls out a roll of notes
hands over two twenties
then he frowns
he checks his pockets again
he cant find his keys
he walks quickly away
eliot ignores him
scrambles into his van
intrigued jack watches eliot drive away
then unlocks his bicycle
annas still trying to pry out the broken key
eliots at a red light
drumming his fingers in frustration as he waits for the light to change
finally anna pulls out the broken key
quickly chooses another
turns it gently
again it doesnt fit
annas hysterical now
she tries the next key
shes stunned for a second
then pulls open the door
eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery
anna staggers to the front door
she pulls at the door
it wont open
frantically she finds the key
unlocks the door leaving the keys in the lock
as she opens the door headlights sweep across the hallway
eliots van pulls up in front of the house
we hear the crunch of eliots footsteps on the gravel outside
anna looks round desperately
eliot reaches the front door
its slightly ajar
he pushes it open
steps warily inside
eliot looks around
the entrance halls empty
then he notices the keys in the lock
anna pulls at the back door
it wont budge
sees a kitchen knife on the counter
quickly grabs it
as she steps back she knocks over a metal bucket
the sounds deafening in the silent house
eliot hears the noise
he calmly locks the door and puts the keys into his pocket
moves down the hallway towards the kitchen
eliot switches on the light
the kitchens empty
he steps back into the hallway
he stands very still
we pull back
anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife
eliot turns towards her
then at the last moment changes his mind
heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room
eliot steps carefully into the viewing room
just then we hear the sound of bare feet stamping along the hallway behind him
anna runs to the front door
she glances around anxiously
sees a staircase leading upstairs
she weakly stumbles up the stairs
anna walks along the corridor
she peers into a room
notices a telephone on a table
she moves over to the telephone
the door creaks closed behind her
eliot hears the creaking door upstairs
he cocks his head upwards
straining to listen
anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone
a telephone rings in the empty kitchen
anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the ringing on the other end
please pick up
please pick up
eliot slowly climbs the stairs
the phone continues to ring
we pull back
paul stares at the phone blankly
a drink in his hand
he looks worse than before
dark circles under his eyes
anna glances back to the door in panic
please pick up
finally paul reaches across and picks up the phone
anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece
help me paul
annas hoarse distorted voice sounds almost malevolent
he stares at the phone as if it was possessed
then slowly puts it down
leave me alone
anna looks at the phone in disbelief
the monotonous tone drones in the ear piece
she doesnt notice eliot appear in the doorway
suddenly the light comes on
im the only one who can hear you now
anna drops the phone
backs away towards a window
eliot walks over and calmly replaces the phone
id be very careful if i were you
the dead have such a hold over the living
what do you mean
nods to the phone he still feels your presence
youre only causing him more pain
if you really loved him youd accept your death and let him go
then prove to me im really dead
you always need proof
eliot places his hands on her shoulders
turns her towards a tall mirror
a pale cadaverous woman
a blood stained tear in the side of her red slip
she moves closer to the mirror
touches her reflection through a thin layer of dust
why do i look like a corpse
because you are a corpse
anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror
its time you finally accepted the truth
you are dead
you will never live again
i am dead
like a father proud of his childs first step
just then he notices something outside
we see a brief flicker of unease in eliots eyes
jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle
looking up at the funeral home
anna in her red slip by the mirror
she looks frightening in the harsh light
like a ghost
strangely jack isnt scared
he continues staring up at the window
eliot coolly turns back to anna
she hasnt noticed jack
still staring at her reflection in the mirror
paul stares at the telephone
after a moment he slowly pulls the telephone plug out of the wall
mechanically grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink
paul opens the wardrobe
pulls out annas clothes
stuffs them into the bin liner
he notices the kitschy doll
shoves it in with annas clothes
anna lies on the slab
she stares at us blankly
her face emotionless
eliot rinses her hair now dyed back to brown
she slowly closes her eyes
close on red dye draining into the sink
eliot picks up the scissors
carefully slices open annas red slip
delicately peels the slip off her body
anna doesnt react
close on anna
she opens her eyes
she turns her head
shes in pauls bedroom
paul lies in bed next to her watching her intently
he looks different
i was dead
i had a car accident
did you ever dream you were dead
paul doesnt reply
the beds empty
anna looks up
pauls in the doorway
she gets up
suddenly the light goes off
the light comes back on
paul stands by the light switch
what are you doing
puts his finger to his lips ssh
dont talk so loud
youll wake the neighbors
annas getting nervous
somethings not right
you dont have any neighbors
suddenly he looks at her reproachfully
did you ever love me anna
close on annas face
she looks away guiltily
anna closes her eyes
unable to answer
say you love me
suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone
arent you going to pick it up
its probably for eliot
annas eyes snap open in shock
eliot stands over her
were back in the prep room
we hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs
is it always like this
what do you mean
i thought when you died you wouldnt feel anything
you wouldnt feel any more pain
you wouldnt have to struggle anymore
but it just doesnt stop does it
upstairs the phone keeps on ringing
eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone
he looks at a day calendar on his desk
idly flips over the page from tuesday to wednesday
its no problem at all
he glances at his watch
ill pick up the deceased from the hospital
thatll be fine
its my pleasure mr
gray bodies lie on steel tables
eliot moves over to one of the corpses
examines it with professional interest
just then the old guy walks in with the pale assistant pushing a gurney with a body wrapped in plastic sheeting
well here he is
the old guy hands eliot a clipboard
the assistant unties the rope
pulls the plastic sheeting away
frank s the top half of his head has been flattened
his head split open
grotesquely distorting his face
that had to hurt
eliot glances at the assistant with disdain
signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the old guy
paul stands by a principal as they watch a janitor snap off the padlock on annas locker
ill leave you to sort out her things
the principal and janitor walk away
paul reaches inside the locker
pulls out a stack of exercise books
an empty pills bottle
then he notices something in the back of the locker
he pulls it out
its a photograph of paul and anna together on vacation
paul looks at it for a moment
trying hard to hold back his emotions
the deafening noise of schoolchildren
paul weaves his way through the crowded corridor
my names jack
miss bryant was my teacher
i saw her last night
paul looks at jack coldly for a second
then walks away
jack follows him
i was going past the funeral home
miss bryant stood there
in the window
in a red dress
anna doesnt have a red dress
you think im lying
im not lying
turns to jack angrily
trying to remember his name jack
im in no mood she needs your help
pauls words echo loudly
the bustling corridor goes silent
almost to himself i cant help her anymore
paul turns and walks away
jack grabs his arm
maybe you just dont love her anymore
paul turns and hits jack with the back of his hand
jack falls to the ground
paul stands over him enraged
you little fuck
you think this is funny
hes about to hit jack again when a stocky teacher grabs him
paul tries to struggle loose
the children stare at paul
a security guard runs across talking into a walkie talkie
another teacher bends down
are you alright sweetie
jack nods numbly
looking up all the time at paul
the security guard grabs pauls arm
the police are on their way
paul watches jack stand shakily
realizes what hes done
he reaches out to jack
step back sir
paul sits at a table
staring blankly at a row of cctv monitors
the door opens
tom walks in
theyre not pressing charges
paul doesnt look up
hes miles away
what the hells wrong with you
holds his fingers close together youre this close to fucking up your career
suddenly looks up you know what he told me
he told me annas alive
you didnt believe him did you
of course not
paul turns back to the monitors
the ghostly figure of a young female teacher drifts hypnotically across the screen
im having these
eliot leans over franks body on the slab
rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up
he gently moves franks head to one side
in the b
anna lies on her slab watching eliot work
frank stares back at her with open dull eyes
his face partially reconstructed with plaster of paris
eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give franks face a more natural texture
then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook like barb at each end
whats that for
eliot looks up surprised
anna stands beside him
he leans down
peels back franks upper lip
to keep it closed
eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back franks lower lip
he attaches the other barb into the lower gum then twists the wires tightly together
he picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs
now his eyes
he inserts the caps into franks eyes
pulls his eyelids over them
glues the eyelids together
is this how youll prepare my body
eliot looks at her for a moment
theres no need
i had to rebuild his face
youre still beautiful
does he have family
hes coming in later
anna touches the white sheet covering franks body
she didnt cry did she
when she came to see me
shakes his head im sorry
its not important anymore
i need to know
he didnt cry
we see a brief flicker of pain in annas eyes
i knew he wouldnt
he always got upset when i cried
he said crying never helped
anna suddenly looks very weary
she leans heavily against the slab
as if shes about to fall
you should rest
he guides her back to the slab
helps her lie down
youre getting weaker
its almost time
eliot strokes her hair tenderly
she looks up at him
can i ask you something
why do we die
a long beat
to make life important
annas fingers curl around his hand
like a vulnerable child
totally trusting in him
eliot looks down at anna sadly
we sense hes conflicted
but then reluctantly he reaches for a syringe filled with amber liquid on the steel trolley
he injects her gently in the neck
watches over her for a moment
then moves to the window
he picks up a window pole
pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness
eliot moves through the funeral home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors
it feels like a ritual
the once airy sunlit rooms are darker now
close on a stream of crystal blue water
we pull back
eliot picks up a white towel
dries his hands
deep in thought
he moves to his desk
picks up a polaroid
the old woman mrs
whitehall lying in her casket
i hope you found what you were looking for
suddenly eliot looks up sharply
as if someone had spoken to him
think nothing of it mr
no need to apologize
eliot moves over to the wall
i really enjoyed our time together
we pull back slowly
eliots talking to a polaroid of an old man
we pull back further
the walls covered in hundreds of polaroids of bodies in open coffins
most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with their eyes wide open
eerily staring at us
eliot touches the polaroid of a young man
we see the fear in the young mans eyes
just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs
eliot moves to the window
a police officer stands at the front door
a squad car parked on the driveway
eliot steps back
calmly continues to dry his hands
eliot leads the police officer through the hallway
how can i help you officer
id like to see the body
we see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes
im his brother
i called this morning
i hope its no trouble
id just like to see him before the funeral
eliot glances at his watch
smiles at vincent
its no trouble at all
eliot leads vincent to franks covered body
vincent looks over at anna
the white sheet only comes to her shoulders her head facing straight upwards
your brothers here
vincent turns back to eliot
were not sure if eliot was speaking to frank or to vincent
eliot pulls the sheet away
franks face is flawless
no sign of any damage
he looks so peaceful
youve done a beautiful job
you should remember him as he used to be
suddenly we hear a faint rustling sound
vincent glances again at annas body
her head is now turned to one side
wasnt she facing upwards a moment ago
vincents puzzled for a second then shrugs
must have been his imagination
thats the schoolteacher isnt it
eliot pulls the sheet over annas face
now is there anything else i can help you with
turns back to eliot
somethings not right here
looks up sharply not right
vincent nods towards franks body
it was a bit more
vincent raises his fingers to his mouth trying to find the right word
eliot manipulates franks lips
a touch more
thats much better
im glad i could help
do you mind if i have a couple of minutes alone with him
not at all
ill wait outside
as eliot leaves vincent looks at franks body
after a moment he glances at anna again
then at the door
he quickly moves over to anna
looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet
he reaches over
and caresses her breast
mesmerized by her naked body
as vincents hand moves down her body he bumps against the trolley
instruments crash to the floor
he pulls back the sheet just as eliot enters the room
i didnt see
eliot notices the sheet covering annas body is slightly askew
he reaches over and straightens it
then looks coldly at vincent
theres an uncomfortable silence
i guess i should be off then
ill see you at the service
vincent glances one last time at anna then leaves
the door locking shut behind him
eliot stares at the door
i just told you
that was your brother
turns to frank you had an accident
why do you people never listen to me
frank doesnt move
his mouth still wired shut
its not a gift
its a curse
eliot picks up a compact
roughly layers franks cheeks with thick rouge
with every word he gets more agitated
i take care of each of you as if you were my children
i wash the shit from your bodies
i dress you
i do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive
and what do you do
eliots extremely irritated now
he grabs a garish red lipstick
smears franks lips
you argue with me
as if it were my fault youre dead
as if i was to blame
slams down the lipstick
youre not talking to me now
you dont want to
the crudely drawn bright red lips
clown like circles of rouge
gaudy and macabre
you dont talk because you have nothing to say
and you have nothing to say because youre a corpse
from eliots reaction it seems as if frank has started to talk again
now i dont want to talk to you anymore
the curtains are drawn
jacks mother still motionless in front of the blaring tv
jack stops in the doorway
im off to school now
his mother doesnt reply
after a moment she slowly turns her head
stares at the empty doorway
jack cycles through the cemetery
he pulls up by a bush
stares at the funeral home in the distance
the service hasnt started yet
jack walks nervously through the empty room to an open casket
he glances back then leans over the coffin
frank merano lies nestled in the velvet interior
his face placid
no sign of the gaudy make up
jack stares in fascination at franks body
he reaches into the casket
touches franks cold hand
in the b
eliot walks into the viewing room
he stops surprised
watches jack intently
whats it like
are you afraid
jack turns quickly
eliot stands over him
you have empathy with the dead
youre drawn to them
just as theyre drawn to you
its a rare gift
jack cant look eliot in the eye
i know you saw anna
then nods his head
youre frightened by it
i was scared too the first time
but you shouldnt be
christ had the same gift
he raised lazarus and spoke to the dead
you spoke to miss bryant
youve spoken to others
who was the first one you spoke to
a long beat
jack looks up sharply
eliots words have clearly struck a chord
you shouldnt be afraid
they wont understand
they dont see what we see
i can help you
i can teach you
anna stares vacantly at the ceiling
eliot places a bunch of tulips on the trolley
turns on a cd
classical music fills the room as before
he moves over to anna
gently pulls away the sheet
your fingernails are dirty
examines his nails
your hands are normally so clean
ive been gardening
he walks over to the sink
scrubs his nails
is it sunny outside
eliot fills a bowl with water
carries it to the slab
the tulips love the sun
i miss the sun
anna glances up at the shuttered window
eliot snaps on his latex gloves
picks up a sponge and wets it in the bowl of water
anna turns to the tulips
are they your favorite flower
i think so
eliot raises annas arm
delicately washes her armpit
along the length of her arm
her skin pale
i thought itd be lilies
dont they symbolize death
they symbolize purity
he moves to her breasts following the contours of her body
pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge
eliot hesitates for a second before replying
whats your favorite flower
eliot softly washes her legs
a beautiful flower
they need shade and lots of water
what do they symbolize
eliot puts down the sponge
dries her body with a towel
roses are red violets are blue
he reaches over to the cd player to switch it off
leave it on
its so peaceful
leaves the music on
paul drives aimlessly past strip malls
he stops at a red light
lights a cigarette
just then he notices something across the street
he looks puzzled
paul gets out of his car
quickly walks over to the store window
a red slip on a mannequin
just like annas red slip
the lights turned green
the drivers honk angrily
paul doesnt hear them
he places his hand against the plate glass
eliot prunes a low hedge by the front door
pauls clearly agitated
eliot stands stiffly
rubs his back
i love gardening but im not sure gardening loves me anymore
shes not dead is she
someone saw her
one of annas students
nods towards the funeral home in the window
do you mean jack
pauls momentarily taken aback
you know him
of course i know him
hes often round here
he seems to have a strange fascination with death
hes eleven years old mr
and like all young boys has a vivid imagination
now if youll excuse me i dont think he imagined it
i think he really saw her
maybe you just want to believe he saw her
paul pushes past eliot and strides into the funeral home
paul moves quickly through the hallway
eliot calmly heads towards paul
i think you should leave before i call the police
paul notices the stairs leading down to the prep room
whats down there
paul runs over to the prep room door
he grabs the handle
eliot appears behind him
shes in here isnt she
give me the key
eliot stares at paul with pity
give me the fucking key
paul turns back
pounds the door in rage
the pounding echoes through the room
anna awkwardly sits up
struggling with her emotions
she wants to call out but knows she has to let paul go
anna gets up
weakly stumbles to the door
im here anna
he places the palm of his hand against the door
anna places her palm against the door
as if touching pauls hand
a tear falls down her cheek
well be happy again
i cant live without you
eliot looks up at paul with sudden interest
anna shakes her head
takes her hand away from the door
walks back to her slab
eliot gently puts his hand on pauls shoulder
paul pushes him away
i know what youre going through
denials a natural part of grieving
anna lies down on the slab
closes her eyes
eliots voice seems far away now
but youve got to accept shes gone
she needs my help
eliot looks at him for a moment
you cant help her anymore
an open plan office
paul weaves quickly through the rows of desks
he seems unbalanced
detectives cautiously watch paul approach tom sitting at his desk his head bent over paperwork
i need you to issue a search warrant
tom looks up
hes shocked by pauls appearance
i need a fucking search warrant
now are you going to help me or what
jeff s a young detective at a nearby desk stands
tom nods to him
its under control
paul hesitates for a second
tom leans forward
hes not amused
just what the hell do you think youre doing
i got a call from eliot deane
are you out of your fucking mind
annas not dead tom
he wont let me see her
hes keeping her there
anna was in a car accident
her car was wrecked paul
shes not dead
tom calmly gets up
moves to a filing cabinet
takes out a file
hands it to paul
heres the coroners report
paul manically rifles through the file
shows file to tom the paramedics phoned it in
they only checked for eye dilation and pulse
the doctor signed the death certificate without even seeing her body
thats standard procedure
there was no eeg
he could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead
are you serious
jeff looks up eagerly from his desk
there are drugs like that chief
total paralysis within seconds
the heartbeat slows to almost nothing
tom shoots jeff a look
im telling you
shes not dead
the boy at school
he saw her
i saw her
paul turns hopefully
finally someone believes him
vincent merano stands by jeffs desk
she was on the slab
ive seen dead bodies
believe me she was definitely dead
just go down there and check the place out
on what grounds paul
do you have any evidence
but do you have anything
we sense his uncertainty
i think she called me
on the telephone
pauls beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds
collect or long distance
jeff snorts with laughter
first you hit a fucking kid
then you attack deane
and now youre telling me your dead girlfriend called you
what the fucks going on
youre loosing it paul
merano and jeff shake their heads looking at paul as if he were crazy
toms voice softens
i know you feel guilty but youve got to pull yourself together
paul slumps in the chair
rubs his face
maybe youre right
but why wont he let me see her
tom signals to merano and jeff
merano walks back to his desk
jeff turns back to his work
the funerals tomorrow
youll see her then
it will give you closure
the suns low on the horizon
eliot whistles softly to himself as he digs a grave
like everything else he does
suddenly a shadow falls over eliot
he calmly looks up
the suns behind the figure
for a moment eliot cant tell who it is
you said you could teach me
gestures to jack to come inside the grave
jack steps back
the grave terrifies him
its only a hole in the ground
im digging it for miss bryant
she belongs here
because shes dead
because theres no life left in her
jack carefully considers eliots words
dont you see
i have no choice
im the only one who can see all these corpses
wandering the earth aimlessly
all they do is piss and shit
suffocating us with their stench
doing nothing with their lives
taking the air away from those who actually want to live
i have to bury them all
i have no choice
now theres two of us
eliot holds up the shovel
jack looks at him for a moment then reaches for the shovel
anna watches eliot brush an invisible speck off her mothers black dress
you did well this morning
she talks with difficulty now
her voice slurred and hoarse
her words muddled and rambling
her eyes even more sunken
her skin even more pale
when paul came
you did the right thing
you let him go
hell be all right now
eliot looks away
he drapes the dress over his arm picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and moves over to her
why do i have to get dressed
tomorrows your funeral
eliot lifts annas arms and puts them through the sleeves of the dress
her bodys stiff and unyielding
i told you
you only had three days
he delicately turns her onto her side
buttons up the dress
i told you to use your time well
as if trying to remember something
eliot gently lifts her legs
pulls on a pair of black tights
i need to
i have so many regrets
i have nothing but regrets
she looks up at him
thats why im here isnt it
to be judged
eliot picks up annas shoes
slips them onto her stiff feet
youre here to understand your life
so you can finally be at peace
i wanted a different life
eliot picks up a nail clipper
gently holds annas hand as he carefully cuts her long nails
then why didnt you do anything about it
no matter what i did everything just stayed the same
id wake up
sit in the same traffic everyday on my way to work
go to sleep
then wake again
eliot stops clipping her nails
what did you really want from life
i just wanted to be happy
you all say you wanted to be happy
what does it mean anna
to be happy
i dont know
dont you understand
thats the whole point
i dont know
yes you do
youre just too scared to admit it to yourself
anna turns away ashamed
she knows hes right
i dont want to talk about it anymore
i just want this to be over
what did you want from life
i dont fucking know
shes finally admitted it
i wanted love
you had love
paul loved you
you dont understand
i was scared
i wanted to love but i didnt know how
when i was a child
anna struggles to pull together her thoughts
when i was a child
i learnt that love
that when you love someone
you get hurt
so i learned not to love
that way no one could ever hurt me again
she looks down at the slab
touches the cold marble
i was always pushing paul away
he thought i didnt love him
he was the only one i ever loved
but i never told him that
and then he stopped loving me
eliot stares at her intently
comes to a decision
what would you do if you had another chance
eliot goes to the door and unlocks it
moonlight floods in from upstairs
washing it with a cold light
anna doesnt move
isnt this what you wanted
eliot holds out his hand
anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab
mist drifts through the cemetery
anna stands in the driveway
pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress and shiny black shoes
she starts walking
anna approaches her mothers house
paul opens the door
hes not surprised to see her
beatrice stands just behind him
a black shawl over her head and arms
in the candlelight we can see the house is full of old women
their faces deeply lined
wearing identical black shawls
they stare at anna whispering in different rhythms
unintelligible words undulating like an ancient prayer
paul and beatrice lead anna to the bed
as she lies down we realize the bed is full of black soil
clouds of ugly flies hang in the air
the old women surround anna in a tight circle
leaning over her
making her feel claustrophobic
she can smell their rotting breath as their prayers grow louder
through the chaos of words we begin to make out
spit it out
anna doesnt understand
then she feels something in her mouth
the women are screaming
spit it out
anna spits out
she gags again
closes her eyes
shakes her head
annas eyes snap open
shes still in the prep room
she steps back from the doorway
i thought you were different
you all say youre scared of death
but the truth is youre more scared of life
eliot switches off the lights
im glad im dead
im glad its over
paul sits in his car
staring out at the funeral home as he nervously smokes a cigarette
the light in eliots room goes off
paul waits for a moment
then gets out of his car
stubs out his cigarette
paul treads carefully along the side of the funeral home
its a full moon
the trees rustle ominously in the wind
casting eerie shadows against the dark house
he finds a window
tries to open it
it wont budge
just then he hears a noise in the bushes
he crouches down quickly
someone watches paul tentatively move to another window
paul strains to open the window when suddenly
hes caught in a circle of bright light
paul turns quickly
a dark figure stands over him
what the fuck are you doing here
the figure lowers the flashlight
im taking you home
close on black earth
a trowel digs into the soil
we pull back
jacks just finished digging a hole in the flower bed
a shoebox beside him
he takes off the lid
the chick trembles in the corner of the box
jack slowly replaces the lid
puts the box into the grave
he pushes the earth over it
the box jerks
we hear the faint rustling of the chick inside
dont be scared
its better this way
eliot lies on his bed
dressed in a dark suit
he hasnt slept at all
his eyes rimmed red
he checks the clock on the bedside table
he glances to the window
dawn light seeps into the room
eliot walks through the garden
a pair of small secaters in his hand
he stops by a bed of violets
still covered in morning dew
he kneels and starts cutting the delicate flowers
anna lies on the slab in her burial dress
her eyes closed
eliot enters the room
he doesnt lock the door behind him
doesnt turn the lights on
doesnt change into his mortician smock
he approaches the slab
the violets in his hand
pulls over a chair and sits next to anna
places the violets on the steel trolley beside her
he looks at her intently
for the first time he seems uncertain
as if questioning himself
after a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the door
hes about to close the door behind him
i dont even know your name
her eyes still closed
too confused to look back at her
its not important
he closes the door
close on beatrices face
her eyes closed
a hand delicately powders her forehead
as if shes being prepared for her own funeral
we pull back
beatrice dressed in black sits in front of a mirror
diane applies her make up
beatrice opens her eyes
paul badly shaven leans against the washbasin
wearing a crumpled black suit
staring vacantly in the mirror
anna lies in a casket as eliot arranges her hair
its time now
she looks up smiling
eliot positions her hands entwining her fingers
you have to look beautiful for your funeral
he picks up a syringe and an ampoule of amber liquid
fills the syringe
we glimpse the label hydronium bromide
this will relax your muscles
make your skin radiant
as if you were still alive
this is how theyll all remember you
can i see myself for the last time
picks up a mirror
hands it to anna
anna looks peaceful
is this the end
the last part is the most difficult
youll have to face it alone
but youll be at peace soon
her breath fogs the mirror
touches the small circle of condensation on the glass
looks up at eliot in shock
eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror then at anna
you lied to me
weve been through this before
youre just imagining you lied to me
eliot injects her in the side of the neck
anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but shes too weak
youre still clutching onto life
dont give in to your fears
youre so close
annas fading away
her hand drops limply to her side
why did you lie to me
she stops struggling
stares blankly at us
eliot looks at her for a moment
he picks up a polaroid camera
the flash explodes in a blinding white light
he pulls out the polaroid
peels off the front and fans it in the air
delicately closes annas eyelids
good bye anna
annas funeral is in progress
eliot stands by her casket
surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies
beatrice in her wheelchair in the front row
diane beside her
a schoolteacher sits behind them with jack and other children
i am the resurrection and the life
those who believe in me even though they die will live
tom and paul appear at the door
tom guides paul to a seat near the back
they that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy and the earth will bring those long dead to birth again
anna lies in an open casket
her eyes closed
she can hear the distorted voice of the priest
we have come here today to remember before god our sister anna
to give thanks for her life
we see an almost imperceptible frown
eliot gestures to beatrice
diane wheels her to the casket
beatrice looks at anna for a moment then touches the violets in annas hands
they were her favorite flowers
turns to eliot how did you know
violets just seemed appropriate somehow
next we see mrs
hutton at the casket
he stares at annas body before being moved on by the schoolteacher
finally paul and tom approach the coffin
anna looks serene
paul takes out the ring box from his pocket
gently slides the engagement ring onto annas stiff finger
suddenly he looks alarmed
turns quickly to tom
what is it
shes so cold
paul turns back to anna
tears prick his eyes
he touches her cheek again
finally accepting her death
im sorry anna
he kisses her lips
eliot watches him carefully
its almost as if hes jealous
jack notices eliots look then turns and stares at paul
as paul and tom walk away eliot closes the casket
begins to screw down the lid
we hear the screws tightening
annas eyes flicker open then close again
just then paul turns back sharply
as if he sensed annas reaction inside the casket
tom gently stops him
shakes his head shes at peace now
paul glances at the casket again then reluctantly allows tom to lead him away
eliot tightens the last screw
his back to the room
suddenly the screwdriver slips
gashes his finger
a drop of blood falls onto the polished wood
eliot stares at the blood for a moment
takes out a pristine white handkerchief
carefully wipes off the blood
then places his hand on the coffin
dont be scared
its better this way
signals to the pallbearers standing nearby
the pallbearers slowly lower annas casket into the open grave
the casket lurches as it settles in the grave
annas eyes snap open in terror
she tries to scream out
but only a soft rattling whisper escapes from her throat
the teacher throws a handful of earth onto the coffin
jack steps up
looks down curiously
as if he could sense anna
then slowly pours the soil from his hand
we have but a short time to live
like a flower we blossom and then wither
in the midst of life we are in death
earth clatters heavily onto the wooden lid
anna gasps softly
the earth keeps falling
the sound becoming softer with each shovelful
bangs her fists against the wood
the graves covered with a stone slab now
votive candles flicker on top
in the b
mourners head to their cars
paul and tom stand by the grave
you sure youre going to be ok
tom squeezes pauls shoulder then walks away
eliot carefully pins annas polaroid to the wall
we pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before
but now we look at them differently
in some faces there is the glimmer of life
in some a despairing pleading look
in others passive resignation
eliot moves towards the window
the dark cemetery
in the distance flickering candles illuminate annas grave
the whole world your mother your fiancee your friends
everyone has buried you
theyve placed a stone above your body
theyve said their good byes and gone back to their tv dinners and shopping malls
thinking that this is never going to happen to them
until its their turn to be buried
think about it anna
eliot glances at his watch
think about it while you still can
paul unlocks his car
hes about to open the car door when he feels someone watching him
jacks observing him carefully
you said she was alive
i never said she was alive
i just said i saw her
paul simply nods his head
too drained of emotion to react
you need a ride
jack shakes his head
paul opens the car door
dont forget to fasten your seat belt
gets in his car
jack looks up at the funeral home
eliot stands in the window smiling at him
were at annas wake
people talk quietly in small groups
paul fills a glass with whiskey
knocks it back in one
people stare disapprovingly
whispering to each other
dont you think youve had enough to drink
eliot stands beside him
paul pours himself another drink
go to hell
an elderly couple shake their heads and walk away
were at a wake
you should show more respect
i know she wasnt dead
eliots suddenly tired of pauls allegations
you come to my funeral home making wild accusations
you have no idea what happens when someone dies
what happens to their body
what happens to their soul
you think anna was alive after the accident
maybe youre right
maybe shes still alive
you obviously dont believe a word i say
so why dont you go and find out for yourself mr
find out whether shes alive or dead
paul grabs eliot by his lapels
shoves him against the wall
you twisted fuck
the rooms silent
everyone turns towards paul
eliot whispers in pauls ear
you dont have much time left
father graham puts his hand on pauls arm
youre not well
paul pushes his hand away
eliot shakes his head sadly
everyone looks at paul with pity as he runs out
paul sprints across the lawn to his car
paul slips his key into the ignition
his hands shaking
eliot watches pauls car roar off
we cant see a thing
but we can hear annas short shallow gasps
and the sound of her nails desperately scratching at the coffin lid
paul drives fast
accelerating then quickly braking as he weaves through heavy traffic
he comes up behind a slow tractor trailer
hits the horn
he swerves into the middle of the road
theres a blind curve ahead
suddenly an suv comes out of the corner
a bright white light sweeps through his car
pauls momentarily blinded
paul opens his eyes
the roads empty
no sign of any traffic
the road was busy a moment ago
just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the car
paul looks in his rear view mirror
an ambulance moves quickly towards him
paul looks through the front windshield
where did the ambulance go
we see the funeral home
bone white in the moonlight
the cemetery next to it
eliots white van sits by the side of the road
pauls car slams to a halt
he jumps out
in the distance the candles still burn on annas grave
paul grabs a shovel by the grave
then the shovel clunks against wood
he kneels down
scrapes away the earth from the coffin
then pulls open the lid
annas eyes are wide open
her fingernails torn and bloody
paul grabs her shoulders
pulls her out of the grave
her body slumps limply like a rag doll
he desperately tries to revive her
but theres no life left in her
hes about to give up when
annas hand twitches
then after a moment she gasps
her eyes slowly focus on paul
paul gently helps anna to her feet
she looks round
turns back to paul
you came back for me
i came back for you
youre safe now
just then paul hears a rustling sound behind him
he cocks his head slightly
theres something unnerving about the silence
suddenly a crow rises noisily into the air
then watches relieved as the crow disappears into the dark sky
he turns back to anna
shes not there
paul looks round desperately
runs between the stone crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her
just then he glimpses something move among the trees
the cemetery is empty
the trees appear to shimmer for a moment
pulls his jacket around him
he doesnt notice the candles on annas grave behind him suddenly blow out
we hear the sound of a siren
the ambulance blasts past
eliot slides a disc into the player
classical music fills the van
he strums the wheel
enjoying the music
paul frantically runs into the parking lot
still calling out for anna
suddenly the interior light in his car comes on
paul looks at the car nervously
he heads over to it
the car door slowly clicks open
stares into the car
theres no one there
through the windshield we see paul approach the car
he peers in nervously
then cautiously gets in
as he switches the interior light off the camera moves slowly around him revealing
anna sitting in the passenger seat
are we going home
paul turns sharply
anna moves towards him
or do you want to make love here
where did you go
anna puts her fingers on pauls lips
clearly turned on
we hear the sound of something being unzipped
ive been waiting for you
i missed you so much
a line of blood trickles from his nose
he touches his lips
looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips
a drop of blood falls on pauls white shirt
it unfurls like a flower
spreading out over the material
i love you
i always did
anna hungrily kisses him
he responds passionately
suddenly we hear a sharp metallic sound
what was that
anna responds as if it was nothing strange
its only the scissors
we see the growing anxiety in pauls eyes
annas just interested in his lips
for your clothes
eliot just put them on the table
paul pulls back
youre safe now
were finally together
a strong bright light sweeps across pauls face
like the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier
paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light
slowly the room comes into focus
eliot stands over paul holding a pair of bloody scissors
paul looks down
his white shirt soaked with blood the material sliced open
where am i
he talks with difficulty
his breath labored
youre in a funeral home
im not dead
jack appears at eliots side
you had a car accident
you swerved off the road
on the way to the cemetery
hit a tree
i saw anna
you buried her alive
im sorry mr
you never made it to the cemetery
you never saw anna
pauls glazed eyes widen in shock
im not dead
eliot speaks calmly
your skull was crushed
your spinal cord pulverized
your brain cells are slowly dying
your bodys already decomposing
im not dead
eliot sighs wearily
hes had this conversation many times before
you all say the same thing
eliots voice with each word fades further and further away
paul closes his eyes
im not dead
