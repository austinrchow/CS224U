dark city early by alex proyas by alex proyas november th a low rumble increases in volume
a black gloved hand wraps around a bulky electrical lever thrusts forward
electricity arcs through darkness
sound of machinery turning on
montage of clocks starting various
second hands turn ticking gets louder
a bare bulb swings from the ceiling revealing clothes on a chair puddles of water on the floor
sleeping eyes in and out of darkness
the eyes open
widen angle on jonathan white a man in his early thirties dark featured
he sits up
hes in a tub of long cold water
his neck aches like hes been sleeping forever
he looks down into the murky water around him
a feint movement beneath the surface something swimming a small dark shape
startled he leaps from the bath
angle the swinging light bulb
the mans hand reaches up stops the light bulb mid swing
he steps to a circular window
the glass is cracked covered in grime
he wipes it this only smears the dirt
its dark out there
angle on white from outside the window through blurry glass
a rapid flying p
pulls back in silence
the window is a speck on the side of a vast grey tower
white shivers cold
he stares down at the puddle he drips on the floor
he looks at his feet and legs covered with numerous small bites
he dries the bloody wounds with a towel
he picks up the clothes lying on the chair puts them on
loose trousers with braces a plain shirt leathers shoes with holes in both soles
in his trouser pocket he finds a key a room number on a plastic tag
he hears splashing in the bath tub
he steps over looks into the murky water
suddenly a small silver fish leaps from the water lands at his feet panting heavily and flapping about
he leans down picks the fish up throws it back into the water
like a blind man he feels the walls comes to a door in the shadows
he hears something on the other side hesitates hand inches from the doorknob
he leans down
blinking through the key hole
of an empty room a glimpse of motion the door across the room leading to a corridor
white pushes the door open steps into the adjoining room
no sign of life
he walks around cautiously
turns lights on
turns them off again
disturbed he studies his features in a wall mirror
angle on open bathroom door the fish has jumped from the tub again and is flapping on the floor
white steps back into the bathroom
he picks up the fish again doesnt know what to do with it so he puts it in his pocket
he searches through things
a grey overcoat in the closet
he goes through the pockets finds a wallet
just a laundry bill some money and a postcard from a sea side town
angle on a revolver on the bed side table
he picks it up his grip tightens on the handle his finger applies pressure to the trigger and
the gun goes off
a bullet ricochets wildly around the room bounces off the metal bed head smashes a vase embeds itself in the wall
startled he holds the gun away from him like it might go off again
he examines it carefully now
opens the chamber
tight on the gun five bullets left
he turns the chamber carefully shuts it puts the gun in the inside pocket of the coat
he moves to the bed
a ripped photograph on the rug
a fragment of a womans face her left eye
he lifts the fragment up
theres handwriting on the back part of a note the rest is missing
he sits on the edge of the bed
as he does this he notices something else on the floor
follows a dark stain on the floorboards to a womans bare foot behind the bed
he stands abruptly fumbles across the bed to stare into a dark corner of the room
in the shadows he can make out a womans naked body lying in a pool of blood
her eyes stare lifeless
white stumbles back in horror throws his hands across his mouth
white stumbles from the room leans against a wall for support
at the end of the corridor elevator doors open
light and musak flood out
white staggers from the elevator moves past a deserted front desk
a voice from the back room hey you
you gotta message
white stops looks uncertainly towards a bead curtain
message in dbox
white sees several nooks for messages and keys in front of him
reaching across the desk he glances through the bead curtain into the managers office
television sounds o
hard to see the man sits in the chair lit by the glow of the t
white grabs the note looks at it
a phone number also his room number and what appears to be his name jonathan white
white thrusts the message in his pocket
got my money
how long have i been here
jeez too damn long if you ask me
what about the two weeks yowe me
totally confused white turns to leave sees something
a painting on a wall cheap print variety waves on a beach
a breeze rustles the pages of a calender pinned beside the picture
tight on white move in on his ear
sound surf crashes on shore
a womans voice whispers what is your name
what is your name
he backs away from the painting looks about the lobby in panic sees a sign toilets
a painted hand points the way
white without turning ill be back later
well ybetter be
camera reveals a figure watching from a shadowy corner of the lobby
as white runs out the mystery man picks up a pay phone dials
whispers into the receiver in a foreign language
white pushes shakily through a red door runs down a corridor
pipes steam and drip water
he rounds a corner slips nearly falls
puddles on the floor stains on the walls
white bursts through the door and into a cubicle
he bends over a toilet bowl and vomits
he looks up wipes his mouth on his sleeve
a breeze tugs at his stringy hair
a tiny ventilation grill above the cistern looks out at the street
sheets of newspaper blow past
a full moon surrounded by blood red clouds hangs above empty streets
a watch on a hairy wrist
seconds tick past
soft flickering light
angle on frank bumstead police inspector
he looks down at the watch
time to leave
he stands heads for an illuminated exit sign
images flicker on a screen
the inspector rushes to the door runs into an usher who gasps
bumstead to usher gesundheit
bumstead quickly moves off
the inspector makes a call licks the tip of a pencil scribbles in a notebook
behind thick glass he argues soundlessly into a phone
big in foreground a popcorn machine rattles noisily
the inspector is upset face strained
a male voice chatters quickly through the receiver
bumstead cuts in but you told me the meeting was ten thirty a burst of chatter
i know sir but i cant make it at nine thirty its um well inconvenient
a stream of chatter stops him
but ive done fine so far without an assistant
the inspector tries to interject as the voice cuts in again
defeated nine thirty
we are underwater
whites face swims into view
bubbles spew from the mouth the eyes stare in horror
white washes his face in a sink
he looks up wipes his face dry with his coat
he turns towards the door to leave
there are two identical
he cannot remember which he came through
takes a guess opens one and steps into darkness
he realizes hes picked the wrong door tries to go back but the door clicks behind him locked
a distant voice over a p
system recites names followed by numbers
a light far away
white walks towards it
he steps into a bare concrete area a public phone hangs on a blank wall
he pulls a coin from his pocket puts it in the slot dials the number on his message
ringing no answer
suddenly white feels cold
there you are
startled white drops the phone and turns
a figure moves forward out of darkness angle on the mystery man from the hotel lobby
the stranger wears a long black coat dark glasses and has extremely pale skin
he is completely bald
he studies white carefully
white glances about nervously walks back up the corridor his eyes pinned to the man
you are lost yes
white retreats faster
a flash of steel a dagger appears by the strangers side gripped in a black leather glove
he moves forward a grin on his pale face
white stops backs against the wall
do not make this difficult
white panics hes cornered
he remembers the revolver
he pulls it from his coat and levels it at the stranger his hand shakes terribly
on the stranger continuing to advance
something about his eyes makes white immobile unable to think clearly
you will not shoot yes
there is a place in your mind a corner of darkness
the gun fires again and again
red splashes appear on the man
he walks forward with spastic jerks as bullets rip into him
a final shot point blank into the strangers forehead
a stream of black liquid spouts from the hole
blue smoke clears
the man stands motionless his mouth hangs open
then his eyes roll up and he collapses to the ground
clicking of new leather shoes walking striking tiles
inspector bumstead strides down a silent corridor
he reaches into his pocket removes a surgical mask places it over his nose and mouth
bumstead steps up to a bald man with a moustache standing at the end of the corridor
the man who is dressed identically to the inspector is his superior chief inspector stromboli
good evening sir
stromboli leads the inspector into a tiled room containing several covered bodies
the two men are greeted by a cheerful looking mortician
here for the examination right
stromboli nods then ignores the mortician and walks along the row of corpses
the handiwork of an extremely sick individual
he throws back covers to reveal horrible mutilations
youive read the reports
not much to go on
we know nothing about him except that he likes to cut them
always the same type of blade
forensics match in each case
anyway its all in the reports read them for yourself
stromboli shakes his head turns away from the final body looks at the inspector
why are you wearing that thing on your face
these places are full of them
continues one thingis for sure heis ambitious
youill be a busy man from now on
you can say that again
stromboli looks annoyed at the smiling man
the mortician becomes serious and goes back to his work
what about thompson sir
wasnit this his case
thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing
anyway he isnit with us any longer
the case is yours
go through his files
take what you need
less business like by the way howis your mother
sheis getting better thanks
stromboli cuts in very good
the chief inspector turns paces to the door briskly
letis go bumstead
so much to do and so little time
a large faded billboard advertisement on a building facade
a portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called lump o a cereal box carton
the camera moves in steadily rises upwards closer on the womanis face finally enters a hole at the centre of her a raftered room on the other side of the
camera tilts to a convoluted staircase at the base the shadow of a man runs
feet pace rapidly
tilt up to reveal white
camera follows as he tries to lose himself from possible pursuers
he steps through a low archway into a back alley rounds a corner
a dead end
white stops looks around then up
heis breathing heavily trying to catch his breath
he starts to shake
above the walls stretch into darkness
an opening way up there he can see stars
something dark crosses the gap of sky
a rushing noise in the distance
wind starts to pick up
trash is being kicked up
a sheet of newspaper wraps around whiteis leg
he tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonit come off
he bends down grabs it to throw it away but something grabs his eye
he stares at the page for a moment then his legs slip from under him and he falls to the ground
he holds his head like itis going to explode
a whimper deep in his throat
his body is trembling violently
push in tight on the paper on the ground
a front page headline man hunt continues for serial killer
white looks up terrified
the rushing noise o
on the wall facing him a door has appeared where moments before there was nothing
the door creaks open to reveal another door within
this one extends outwards on the end of a lengthening wooden shaft
white stands quickly thrusts the newspaper into a pocket
tries to side step the advancing door but itis too late he can only open it and step through to avoid getting pinned to the wall
hand held p
through the swaying beads hanging in the back room doorway
two figures peer into the room
we are looking for jonathan white
the hotel manager looks up moves forward into light a squat hunch backed man with glasses
he steps through the beads glares at the intruders
on the men an uncanny resemblance to the one who tried to kill white
black coats glasses pale skin
a black gloved hand flashes forward grips the manageris face and doesnit let go
the manager struggles gulps for air
heis pushed back heavily against the wall
which room is he in
the leather glove squeezes blood trickles from the manageris ears through the fingers
another very short figure is searching the room
he hears noises o
in the corridor runs to the door presses against the wall
on the man fredrick a stunted body an oversized head thick limbs
the rest of his features lost in shadow
the door swings open a shaft of light floods the dark room
on the two mystery men as they step in and look around
they search the room knock stuff over
one of the men kicks at the womanis corpse in the corner
behind him fredrick still hiding near the door slips into the corridor unnoticed
a flying perspective past buildings
an insect like buzzing o
way down below in a canyon of silent buildings a lone figure walks
a breeze pulls at whiteis hair and coat
he takes out the wallet a few dollars
the city is dead
buildings hang down out of black
day time was never invented
as he puts the wallet back in his pocket a business card he hadnit noticed flutters to the ground
he stops picks it up
in simple print doctor d
a phone number
scribbled handwriting on the back says thursday
on white he glances across the street
a broken neon fish buzzes above the doorway
he walks up rickety stairs into a small room with five or six tables
he sits and waits
a clock ticks on the wall midnight
white coughs for attention
a noise from a doorway
a shadow moves towards him dragging one foot as it walks
a small asian woman appears and limps to his table
she speaks very quickly in chinese
he does not understand
she points to a chalk board on the wall a list of dishes also in chinese only one in english the last one
at the bottom
in small print
white nods the noodles
iill have some noodles
the old woman rips a yellow ticket from a pad gives it to white
a number on it
she points her crooked finger again at a speaker box above a small serving window in the wall
a greenish fluoro pulses from the room within
she leaves again
white looks about the empty room
insects are zapped on an illuminated device hanging on the wall
an old air conditioner rattles noisily
noises from the kitchen voices argue in chinese a baby cries
white removes the newspaper from his coat and spreads it on the table
he overcomes his fear starts to read the article
leans forward hands trembling
without realising he holds the paper over a candle burning on the table
the paper catches fire is engulfed
he drops the flaming page on the table
now the table cloth starts to burn
white is frantic
on a nearby table he finds a pitcher of water and dumps this on the flames
it kills the fire but leaves a black hole in the table cloth
the paper is ash
he moves to another table pretending nothing happened fans the smoke away
bumstead is moving quickly
he suddenly trips and falls to the floor
he curses under his breath then looks up
a door thompson detective inspector on the frosted glass
bumstead stands pushes into the office
a total mess paperwork everywhere dozens of used coffee cups rotting food in greasy paper bags
bumstead shakes his head
a real shame
he starts to look around
tight on filing cabinet a drawer is pulled open
thompsonis files are also a mess
bumstead continues to shake his head
he reaches for a file
a loud snap
bumstead screams he recoils
a mousetrap has snapped over his fingers
he pulls it off his hand throws it to the floor cursing
white is still waiting for his food
he leans down to scratch an itchy ankle lifts his trouser leg to examine the bites worse inflamed
he uses a napkin to wipe at the pus
aerial perspective of a fly circling the room looking down on white
on the fly it lands on a plate of half eaten food on another table
the creature is some kind of surveillance device half insect half machine
itis spying on him
move in tight as inbuilt camera lenses focus in its head
it shits on the food behind it
white is oblivious to this
heis finished examining his leg is sitting quietly
his head nods forward briefly
white looks up
a trap door has opened in the ceiling
two feet in black leather shoes descend from the hole
a sea breeze blows through the room
the sound of surf seagulls crying
on whiteis nose twitching
he can smell the ocean
the wallpaper comes alive like a seething tangle of worms
one by one three men in black coats lower into the room floating on air
they pull out knifes step forward
on white rigid with terror
on the men though their faces cannot be seen clearly in the gloom they too resemble the man who confronted white earlier
they walk towards him slowly holding knifes above their heads
ready to attack
they lean over him pause dramatically
donit fall asleep
chuckles softly might never wake yes
this man turns to the others
they all smile then turn back to white
men in unison fifty six
another voice has been speaking softly now it is louder
repeating fifty six
angle a chair falls to the floor
white leaps up from the table terrified disoriented
just a dream he had dozed
widen angle the place is still empty
white glances to the serving window
a dish waits for him framed in the glowing fluoro square
he gets it
a bowl of soupy liquid with noodles
he sits down
he is about to start eating realizes he has a fork instead of a spoon
picking up the bowl again he heads to the kitchen
he takes a door beneath a set of wooden stairs and finds himself in another corridor
he looks about unsure which direction to go in
white is lost still holding the soup
he moves through a number of rusted metal doors that open and shut automatically
each reveals another room or corridor
deserted spaces long forgotten dusty crumbling
he feels the fish moving about in his pocket pulls it out and looks at it
white holds the dying fish in one hand the bowl of cold soup in the other
disgusted he puts the fish into the bowl
a large clock suspended from the rafters
a tug at his coat
standing beside him is fredrick the little man from whiteis hotel room
fredrick stutters where have you been
the doctoris been worried about you
who are you
fredrick looks nervously down the corridor
cimon letis go
we donit have any time
the little man grabs whiteis sleeve starts to pull him along
hold it a minute
letis start at the beginning huh
angle on the top of a set of stairs in front of them
two dark figures appear
fredrick looks up at them in horror
looks at white quick
both men run like crazy white awkwardly holding the bowl of soup
they come to a junction each takes a separate corridor
fredrick finds some stairs climbs two at a time
white climbs into frame looks around finds another corridor
the little man is nowhere to be seen
white reaches another junction several corridors branch off
each passageway completely deserted
he keeps running
a photo flash illuminates the dead body of the hotel manager slumped in his own blood
bumstead leans into frame examines the corpse
he notices several stab wounds in the manis abdomen
various cops search the room
one cop walks up to the inspector
we got another one upstairs bumstead deadpan great
a small room with arched windows that look over the city
fredrick is pulling a notebook and pen from under an upturned table
he scrawls rapidly screws the message into a tight tube then puts it into a metal cylinder he finds beneath the table also
he glances out a window notices a figure standing beneath a street lamp below looking up at him
startled fredrick darts back into shadow goes to a wall covered in about a dozen vertical pipes running up into the ceiling
tight on one of the pipes he opens a small hatch and puts the metal cylinder in it
the cylinder is snatched from his hand sucked into the pipe with a rush of air
fredrick steps back a sigh of relief
a shadow falls across his back
tight rushing along lengths of rusted pipe at blinding speed
the cylinder races around corners
it clanks and grinds
hurtles up the side of a building
then plummets underground
rushes through darkness
the camera moves along a bridge like structure
an enclosed corridor supported by rotting wooden pylons
under the bridge pipes spew sewage into stagnant water
angle on white walking seen through a series of illuminated dirty windows
he occasionally glances into the bowl he holds before him
tight on the fish swimming weakly in the soup
angle on white he stops looks up at o
sound of clattering metal
a pipe runs the length of the corridor the invisible clanging cylinder races away into darkness
then the silence is shattered by a piercing series of screams somewhere in the building
white hurriedly moves towards the source
white rounds a corner stops notices a small rectangular hole in a wall
another scream weaker now he runs to the hole in the wall and looks through
a small very ordered room
a fake fireplace bathes the room in a warm glow
white cranes his neck forward stretches his head through the hole
he can see into an adjoining room to his right two dark figures stand over a man on the floor lying in a pool of dark crimson
the man looks up itis fredrick just as both dark figures stab him repeatedly with bloody daggers
he doesnit scream this time just gags on blood running from his mouth
suddenly a sliding door slams onto the back of whiteis neck traps his head in the hole
he struggles tries to free himself
drops the bowl of soup
it shatters on the hard floor makes a mess
inside the bathroom the killers look up at the smashing noise
back in the corridor white pulls with all his strength
the door gives and he stumbles backwards
he is about to run away but glances at the floor
the fish is flapping about still alive
white darts from a doorway trips and falls
he sprawls at the base of sweeping stone steps
he looks at a building towering above him
chiselled in the facade above the entrance a series of ply wood silhouettes race through frame
stop suddenly mechanically
chunks of ply wood blast away violently
bumstead is practising his marksmanship
a hand on his shoulder
he whips around startled
on miss crenshaw a young stiff looking woman
donit ever sneak up on me like that
who are you
she puts out her hand
iim your new assistant
i didnit requisition a secretary
the chief inspector thought you might need a hand
bumstead uncertain oh
he takes her hand tentatively
iive taken the liberty and had inspector thompsonis office searched as i believe you instructed
all clear now sir
they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories
you wonit regret this sir
bumstead moves off
white steps into a vast empty room stops beneath a big sign saying silence in formal letters
the place seems abandoned then he notices a hint of movement
cigarette smoke snakes into the air a light across the expanse of polished floor
he walks up to an elderly female librarian sitting behind a desk smoking reading
white looks somewhat distraught still
keep newspapers here birth certificates records of deaths that kind of thing
the librarian looks up from her book
which would you like first okay
she takes her glasses off
her eyes are tiny like pin heads
she studies white
are you alright
he looks around restrained panic
white looks at the woman sure
librarian nods mmm hmm
stairs at the end of the hall
row near the toilets
she replaces her glasses watches white rush away
donit mention it
she blows her nose into a handkerchief
the snort echoes white rushes down a dark hall lined with bronze statues
he finds section c then walks between towering rows stacked with old volumes
comes to number
he follows an arrow past row after row finally finds row but then it skips straight to letters again a b c etc
he stops and looks around sure enough a door displays a small sign toilets
white is sweating profusely
he now sits on a chair takes off his shoes rubs his feet
he pulls a book from a shelf behind him looks about opens the book and tears several pages out folds them stuffs them into his shoes to plug up the
he gets up tries to backtrack comes across an elaborate diagram of the library interior
an arrow points to a section near a wing labelled maps
near the arrow it says you are he keeps walking
he finds the door to the maps wing but the door is locked a sign is nailed to it we are remodelling
we apologize for any white annoyed now tries to force his way in
puts his shoulder to the door pushes several times
it crumbles under his weight rotten
he finds himself in a dusty room
a narrow room filled with rows of bookshelves with stacks of old newspapers
tight on white he steps forward pulls a folded newspaper off the shelf
the instant he picks it up it crumbles to dust in his hands
he picks up another and another each in turn breaking apart and dissolving to nothingness
two silhouetted figures face each other across a polished black table
they speak in a foreign language
a phone rings
figure picks up the receiver and listens attentively
figure is involved with various metal shapes he is trying to lock together
a complex puzzle
he gets impatient with the puzzle dashes it to the floor
figure on the phone hangs up and writes something
hands the note to figure who in turn drops it into a chute
the note falls from a slot in the wall before figure in shadow yet again
he reads from the note over a silver microphone still in the unfamiliar tongue
tight on a speaker his distorted voice
a final mysterious person figure listens to the announcement
he takes a stick and moves a small cut out figure of a man across a board away from a large grouping of similar cut outs
the board resembles a planning table in a war room
a high angle as the camera pull backs on the grouping of cut out figures
more and more of them
a sinister army
white is in a phone booth
he removes the note from his pocket dials
no answer again
he dials the operator
a muffled voice over the line
iim trying to reach nine zero eight triple two
i canit get through
he reaches into his pocket pulls out a coin puts it into the slot
heis sweating again
he wipes his brow with a trembling hand
which area is that number listed in
is that near the ocean
the ocean never mind
have a jonathan white listed
he hangs up then removes the business card he found in his wallet
he is about to dial but decides otherwise
he steps into the street
white walks between tall buildings towards a narrow street that branches off into two separate routes
he canit decide which branch to take he steps to the left then steps back takes a few steps to the right reconsiders again
police station bumsteadis office night track along piles of towering files bursting at the seams with paperwork to find bumstead hunched over notes photographs and files
his eyes are rimmed with red
he doesnit seem to be getting anywhere
he looks up
the secretary stands in the doorway with another big pile of paperwork
i donit drink coffee
a cup of tea would be good
milk and no sugar
crenshaw puts the paperwork down on bumsteadis already overcrowded desk
he looks at her like she just slapped him
these are the investigations of a madman
he has fabricated an entire bizarre paranoid delusion with no internal logic whatever
without looking up this is a mess
a horrible mess
looks at her now itis the second time now
miss crenshaw looks concerned
look at this
he holds up a sheet of white paper a report
the woman steps over and looks at it
you typed this report
look at this
the woman bends down adjusts her glasses examines it
it seems fine
fine look here
his finger points at the bottom of the page a tiny insignificant ink smudge
how can i submit this
do you wash your hands before you type things
well be more careful please
an embarrassed beat then bumstead reaches for the phone but crenshaw is on it first
inspector bumsteadis office
she cups the receiver with her hand looks at bumstead
the chief inspector said he would see you now
tracking shot towards a door chief inspector on the frosted glass
a hand reaches into frame knocks twice
bumstead steps into the office finds stromboli wandering about the room distracted searching for something
what is it
he pulls the waste basket up and empties the contents onto his desk sorts through it
i need to speak with thompson
officially i need your written permission
stromboli is looking through his desk drawers now
why do you want to speak to him
he might be able to
stromboli from under desk bumstead donit be so paranoid
leave him alone heis a sad case
itis extremely important to my investigation
iill be the judge of that
actually i was wondering sir if you could let me have a few uniforms to follow up for me
pokes head above desk absolutely not
up to my ears in cases right now canit spare anyone
stromboli becomes distracted again stands up looks behind pictures hanging off the walls
a big sign suspended above his desk says so much to do and so little time his motto
what makes you think that
if you would learn to concentrate on facts not get so side tracked you might get things done faster bumstead
the door clicks shut
stromboli looks up the inspector has gone
white walks under stone archways
across an empty plaza is a sign above a door drugs open hours and in smaller print recently added beneath shave white walks between bare dusty shelves
only one shelf carries products box after box of lump o
he moves up to a small counter
a man with thick glasses dressed like a barber is seated there
i need something to keep me awake
looks like you need a haircut to me
just some pills
only two bucks
shave as well
white annoyed now your sign says you sell drugs well iim here to buy some
he waves dramatically to a shelf above his head with several bottles of all sorts of different coloured capsules
tell you what let me cut yer hair give ya watcha need half price
canit argue at that
white evenly i donit want a haircut
camera tracks off a clock on a wall reveals white in a barber chair
the barber gleefully works on whiteis hair
a thin old guy in a moth eaten suit steps from behind a curtain smiles playing a violin
heis passionate but bad
barber talks fast cut hair when i was in the navy yiknow havenit lost the touch
bet youire happy ebout that
i need to get to the ocean

the old guy with the violin moves back and forth behind white smiling as he plays
grandpa thought customers might like some mood music
white unconvinced nice

white nervous now not me
barber looks out the front window as his hands busily trim hair
lathers up whiteis face that night couple weeks ago
that was real cold
yeah iim like that
senility says the wife
but she sure canit complain
the erector set still works good
points to head and this ainit no fucking rug
grandpa laughs and plays louder
push in on white he smiles weakly
a hand scrawls cryptic diagrams into a notebook
doctor schreber at his desk
heis bearded with thick lensed glasses
he puts the phone down sits quietly at his desk staring into space lost in thought
a loud rattling noise fills the room
schreber looks up
a rusted pipe runs across the ceiling and down one wall
he steps across to the pipe on the wall leans down looks into an open hatch at its base
without warning out of the hatch pops the metal cylinder from several scenes previous and bounces off the doctors head
he curses picks it up opens it
he plucks out the note and reads fredrickis scrawled message things donit get back to you
schreber looks up then punches his fist into the desk angrily
moves down halls made of wood slatting the floors walls and ceilings are bare boards
tight on a manis shadow as it descends a wooden staircase
reveal white he rummages in a paper bag as he walks
pulls out two capsules swallows them
now he pulls out a pack of lump o rips it open eats ravenously
white steps out into a street turns a corner drops the empty packet of cereal
now he sees two figures approach
he hides behind a wall before he is seen
suddenly a deafening ringing startles him
he looks across a plaza
a bell tower black against the sky
white stares up into the night
white walks in sits on a pew towards the back of the room glances over his shoulder
he tries to blend in with the small gathering of people sitting silently around him
a priest appears at the altar cloaked in a blood red robe followed by two altar boys also in red
they move past a statue of an insect like creature walk in circles chanting softly stop and stare at the congregation through eye slits in their hoods
the priest begins his sermon
the night is deadly
there is a criminal among us
white looks forward
tight on the priestis hand it rises points moves over the heads of the congregation accusingly
suddenly the red finger jabs towards an old woman in the front row
it could be she
the innocent across the street
all the congregation turn and stare at the woman
the hand moves slowly now across to a beautiful japanese woman several rows back
or the temptress next door
the priest pauses dramatically then or mister nervy stranger at the back
suddenly the finger is pointing at white
all the faces turn stare suspiciously at white
angle on white frozen with fright
fortunately his face is obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand continues the sermon
the people look away
you are thinking it could be anyone
and youire right
why it could even be mother
white goes to leave
as he stands he notices the doors of the church open two figures step in and move into the candle light
mystery men whiteis bizarre pursuers
they look around
white ducks down crawls between pews startling several of the congregation
he motions to them to keep quiet
he runs into the legs of the beautiful woman the priest pointed out
she is startled momentarily but looks down at him smiles
priest continues sermon evil stalks our streets
it seeks to hide in our hearts
have you not evil within you now
white sees a nearby confession box
staying low he runs almost knocks over a large illuminated candle holder darts inside
the girl watches him
a gaunt faced woman stands
she looks at the priest
he took my little boy
iill rip out his eyes
inside white breaths relief
carved on the dark stained wood in front of him is a crucified insect
a voice surprises him
another priest you have sinned
white watches the two mystery men walk past through the ornate wooden grill in front of his face
i am listening
white lying thereis a
i dont know but i think i ahh
the mystery men look towards the box for a moment towards white but keep walking
you seem restless
the mystery men seem to have gone
white takes out the gun keeping it hidden from the priest
opens the chamber
tight on the gun only one bullet left
someoneis after me
then we must call the police
that isnit necessary
the silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward
then who is after you
what sins have you committed
just let me sit here for a moment
iill go soon and stop bothering you
the priest suddenly stares incredulously at white
his eyes widen in horror
youire the murderer
starts to yell yes
that must be it
donit kill me
white lunges grabs his collar with one hand slaps the other over his mouth
the old man stares at him trembling uncontrollably
walk out quietly
holds up gun understand
the priest nods stupidly
white pushes him out of the confession box grabs his coat from behind puts the gun to his back
together they head for the doors
still no sign of the mystery men
donit kill me
white loses his temper grabs the priest shakes him violently
white not so quietly iim not going to kill you okay
the priest kicks white in the leg bites his hand
while white is wincing in pain the priest breaks away
priest shouting pointing people start to scream and run
the gaunt woman points at white
gaunt woman screams insanely itis him
rip out his eyes
frightened white holds the gun out
everyone panics scatters
people run for the exit
religious statues topple and smash
the gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor trampled by the crowd
amidst the chaos the two mystery men appear across the room see white head towards him
he turns and runs
white climbs narrow stairs rapidly
white stops nowhere left to go just a long drop to the street through a series of arched windows
a low raftered room three huge black bells
suddenly a groan of gears in the ceiling and the bells start to swing build momentum
cla a a ang
a cacophony of noise
white puts his hands over his ears in pain then turns to the stairs
through the swinging bells the mystery men climb the last few steps on the other end of the dark room
they advance slowly clutching daggers
white raises his gun
difficult to find his target the approaching men are obscured by the bells
white steps sideways never taking his eyes off the men
they follow him slowly pivoting about the bells in the centre of the tower pursuers and pursued remaining a semi circle apart
white shouts what do you want
the men stop
so does white
they separate now approaching him from opposite sides moving around the bells
white doesnit know who to point the gun at he swings back and forth one to the other faster and faster as the men approach
he lets them get uncomfortably close then swings to his right thrusts the gun to one manis forehead
the man steps back spouting liquid from the bullet hole hits a low railing falls into the shaft at the centre of the tower
the second man swings his dagger at white
white falls backwards dropping his gun clumsily
the man advances smiling kicks the gun across the wooden floor
white clutching at straws lifts his foot kicks down hard on a loose floorboard
the board flies up pivoting against whiteis heel catches the mystery man with a crack under the chin
white runs at the off balance man head butts him in the stomach
the man recoils canit stop steps off backwards into space plummets into darkness towards the street below
white relieved turns dusts himself picks up his gun
looks down at the floor
broken glass and capsules everywhere he dropped the bottle of pills during the scuffle
starts to pick them up
behind him something is rising
the shadowy mystery man is levitating himself back up to the bell tower
he lands behind white approaches lifting his dagger closer and closer
white glances around
the man lunges pushing white towards the shaft beneath the swinging bells
white falls dangles over dark space the man stands above him
mystery man shouts do not make us hurt you
the bells are swinging very close to the man
it will be inconvenient yes
suddenly to whiteis amazement the shiny black rim of a bell clips the manis head
slams it against a low wooden beam in the ceiling
a splash of black liquid
the man slumps to the ground his head crushed beyond recognition
white pulls himself up stands over the manis body trying to decide what to do
a movement catches his eye
tight on the collapsed manis ear something moves inside
a black insect half dead crawls out of his crushed head
white revolted squashes the insect under his shoe
rapid move across mystery men screaming
faces contort with pain
intercut with electricity arcing between electrodes
a building against the sky
the windows explode
glass blows out raining down on the street
a concrete wall splits open
slime oozes through the crack
an old man walks on a deserted street looks up at the sky
one of the lenses of his spectacles cracks without warning
a chair falls over in a dark room
a woman under a hair dryer gossips on a phone
suddenly the phone emits a high pitched shriek
her ear spouts blood and she screams
a small transistor radio emits a high frequency and short circuits with a spark
tight on a wristwatch spinning backwards rapidly completely haywire
inspector bumstead stands on a street corner staring blankly at his watch
taps it several times annoyed then looks up at a three storey building
he holds a piece of paper in his other hand on it a number rapidly scrawled
the dilapidated building arched windows only on the topmost floor
a faded number on the facade also
the windows light up continuously with rapid bursts of white light
the inspector climbs a staircase enters a dark room
two figures move about
bumstead glances at a uniformed man standing beside a fake fire who acknowledges his arrival
to the side a police photographer flashes something swinging back and forth hanging from the ceiling
it looks like
his arms and legs missing
a pool of blood beneath the mutilated torso
bumstead looks at the cop
how long have you been here
maybe ten minutes
looks at his watch thatis strange
the cop is shaking his watch tapping it with his finger
he looks up
bumstead indicates his own watch
he removes a notebook from his pocket walks about the room glances at objects makes notes
bumstead steps over to a small rectangular hole in the wall
he examines it carefully then bends down and puts his head through
on the other side is a corridor snaking off into darkness
just beneath the hole is a broken dish and a puddle
lying half in the puddle is the business card of doctor d
without removing his head from the hole he shouts to the nearby cop
i want prints over here
suddenly the door has caught bumsteadis head in it
the cop and the photographer run over to help
move in on a doorway
above it a small illuminated red sign he stands on the street under the sign rummaging in his wallet obviously looking for the business card he doesnit have anymore
a white room bare
dirt stains the walls near the air vents
a nurse is typing behind her desk
a thumping fills the room
the nurse stands removes her shoe and hits a pipe running along the wall several times
the noise stops
the front door creaks open and white enters
she watches him step into the room
i want to see the doctor
what time was your appointment
white angry look
tell him im here
now hes leaning across her desk threateningly
nurse scared standing yes certainly
who should i say
just get him
suddenly a door opens and doctor schreber clutching a file of papers steps out
he freezes stares at white
the papers fall from his hands to the floor
a group of dark silhouettes file into a concrete room
the mystery men have gathered
like the men who pursue white they wear coats leather gloves dark glasses and have near white skin
one man points to diagrams on a chalk board and speaks in the peculiar foreign tongue
tight on the diagram a path through the city
a circle marks the point where the red line ends a cathedral
the man goes into broken english a guttural accent
it has failed
another man stands at the rear of the room
this is becoming dangerous yes
yet another man starts to tremble violently seized with some kind of convulsion
he froths at the mouth and throws his head about
a taller man standing beside him opens a silver box removes a small writhing worm
he places this on the tip of the trembling mans tongue who swallows it and calms down
lets get this over with
another man rises suddenly pushes forcefully to the front of the group
what about the dance steps
this is my responsibility we must resolve this issue yes
the men turn to face him
he is out of line
he becomes irritated as if to say something further then pulls himself short sits down
the situation has changed
pacing the room this one is in possession of knowledge
man cuts in to avoid influence yes
rumbling noise o
attracts everyones attention
they all look to a round portal high on a wall
the noise is louder
several figures on stilts run past outside the opening then the noise subsides
the mystery men go back to more important things
it gets interesting yes
it has gone too far
tell mister black
man stares blankly into space he makes a peculiar clicking noise with his mouth his eyes roll upwards
the camera glides down a corridor towards a door a sign says doctor is in
white sits in a leather chair across from an ornate wooden desk
the doctor paces up and down in front of glass jars containing preserved specimens
he stops looks at white
you remember nothing
who you are
what youve done
you know something about me
ah that would be cheating wouldnt it
smiles is there nothing you remember
not even a detail
you must try
you think i havent been trying
calms himself its like there was never anything there
pauses just water
a woman whispering
looks up yawns i need to stay awake
do you have any pills
the doctor walks to a glass cabinet and removes a bottle takes out two green capsules
hands them to white
sits behind the desk again
what does she say
asks my name
over and over
just like a broken record
only thing is i cant answer
ive no idea what my name is your name is john white
thats what people keep telling me
te doctor walks to a small sink in the corner returns hands white a glass of water
white swallows the pills
schreber indicates pills and whats this about
white stands up starts to pace nervously
tell me about them
white interrupts yeah well why dont i ask some questions for a change
if you like
youre supposed to be my doctor right
i am your doctor
white is very agitated now his voice is getting edgy
known me for long
white cuts in am i a killer
i cannot say
you dont know the answer to that
i told you i cant remember a thing
white reaches across abruptly grabs the doctor
white angry now shouting look you know something about me out with it
lets end this bullshit
i want answers
the doctor is obviously scared
we wont get anywhere like this
lets take things in easy steps
tight on drawing pins being pushed into a map
a seeming random pattern across the terrain of the city
each pin is labelled victim victim
hes tired like he hasnt slept
hes looking at the map stuck to a wall
theres several neat piles of folders on the kitchen table in front of him
the kitchen itself is incredibly neat everything completely organized
bumstead shakes his head slowly turns away from the board
picks up a cup of hot tea pours milk into it from a small jar
tight on the tea cup cream swirls into a rapidly dissolving spiral
bumstead looks up
puts down the cup hurriedly turns back to the map
with a thick pen he traces a line between each point marking the location of the victims
he steps back to examine his handiwork
a spiral moving outwards
beyond the last victim it becomes a dotted line following the same trajectory but with a big question mark beside it
bumstead glances over to a blackboard with a list of names and addresses on it
he holds up the doctors card and stares at it
he turns it over notices an address on the back
schreber is showing white a series of charts
the doctor seems nervous about whites potential for further violence
a penetration of the left parieto occipital area of the cranium
complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges
without going into detail
the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles producing incipient atrophy of the medulla
white cuts in look
it was a simple question
can someone kill and not remember it
schreber smiles im sorry
i get carried away sometimes
ah afraid so
did she drown
the woman you told me about
she was found in a canal disembowelled
the body wrapped in a bed sheet
white shakes his head looking blankly at the doctor
you remember nothing eh
shakes his head let me show you something
schreber turns points to double doors
he walks towards these
formation of memories is the most important of brain functions
they step into a room of living animal experiments
we are little more than a sum of memories
from them we reference who we are where were going
without a past we are nothing
this is why you are so interesting
im nothing then
anything but my friend
the two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements
it feels no pain
white turns and starts to pace away
schreber reluctantly follows
can i get my life back
schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats
we know of two kinds of memory
firstly declarative memory
the rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols
schreber turns to look at white eyebrow raised
and then there is procedural memory
tight on his slender finger pointing to a machine also run by rats
the object is to make it through a guillotine device
one rat is successful the other is chopped neatly in two
research on simple animals can be
to show us where memory storing systems are located for example
i am building an experiment with hamsters next
looks at nearby cage of hamsters cute little things
schreber puts a hand on whites shoulder
listen to me talk
you must be hungry
white nods again extremely troubled
schrebers office is an annex of his living quarters a maze like series of rooms and halls
white is led down a dark hall by schreber clutching a candle
whole damn wing lost power
keep meaning to get it fixed
here we are
theyve stopped outside a flaking door
a small eat in kitchen
dirty and run down
white sits at a bench as schreber removes items from the refrigerator
the doctor holds up a large frozen fish
head and all
just how i like em
angle on frying pan on stove the fish lands in it and starts to sizzle furiously
i dont blame you for getting angry
you are in a frustrating situation
you must be patient though
trust me completely
im here to help
a set of swinging doors on the other side of the room open slightly and the nurse looks in
nurse to schreber i have to talk to you
it cant wait
she shakes her head with a serious expression then darts out again
schreber to white excuse me
ah make yourself at home
alone white looks around the bleak room
he takes off his coat and sits down again
he removes the fish
the eye opens
the creature looks up at him
it breaths painfully
still kicking huh
he puts it back in his pocket
the other fish is spattering oil everywhere
smoke starts to fill the room
white steps over and looks at the frying pan
the fish is turning black
he turns the heat down
he notices a small hole in the wall
at eye height
he steps across looks through
tight on whites eye through the hole
a dark room
shadows on the wall
something wet some kind of animal moving in the darkness
he can hear breathing and whispering voices
whites eyes start to blur he rubs them
how are things in here
white spins like hes caught doing something wrong
the doctor walks across to the stove prods the frying fish with a fork
ah nearly done
so tell me about your dreams
im very interested
white is having a hard time focusing
just the typical fabrications of a distorted mind
you know chased by mysterious men in black that kind of thing
angle on schreber with his back turned at the stove
the image is blurring
ah our friends in black
they are not just a figment of your imagination you know in fact none of what you are experiencing is anything but real
smoke rises thickly around the doctor
i know everything about you
you have no choice but to trust me
flames are shooting up around schreber from the frying pan
his arms catch fire and he suddenly spins around clutching flaming daggers in both hands his whole body engulfed in fire his face charred black flesh hanging off his skull
scarey isnt it
white startles awake
schreber stands at the stove looking at white
everything is normal
are you feeling alright
white stands awkwardly pulls his coat on
what are you doing
i have to go
you cant go yet
weve got so much to talk about
suddenly white feels feint leans against the wall to steady himself
you need to lie down
on white swaying
the scene is distorted like looking through water
things start spinning
schreber echoic yes
a little something to help you relax
a tile floor rises rapidly towards camera
objects float underwater
they rise upwards amidst bubbles break the surface
a storm at sea dismembered body parts float all the way to the horizon
two foetuses in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass
this is madness
if were caught
help me with these straps
white wakes strapped to an exantination table
schreber and the nurse loom above him
the nurse hands schreber a long chrome syringe
the doctor moves towards white
schreber holds syringe up now you must relax anton
a door bell rings o
the nurse makes for the door
hes tapping the side of the syringe squirting out air bubbles
the door bell rings again very insistent
schreber looks at the nurse annoyed
whoever it is get rid of them
she heads to the door turns back
schreber puts the syringe down fumbles in his pocket pulls out a huge collection of keys on a ring walks to the nurse hands them to her
white manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him
the nurse leaves the doctor shuts the door locks it
he steps over to white
im sorry i had to put you through this anton
lowers syringe to whites forehead there will be some pain but things will be easier this way
white lashes out punches the doctor in the face
his glasses go flying and he falls to the floor blinded scrambling for the spectacles
a convenient scalpel cuts white from his remaining bonds
he undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe into the struggle continues each man tries
to turn the syringe on the other
white pushes the doctor who falls backwards
schreber leaps onto him both fall against a tray of medical instruments
a loud thumping on the examination room door
white is grabbed from behind pinned down with the syringe inches from his face
a crash o
the door bursts open
a rotund silhouette is revealed clutching a police special flashing a badge
a squeaky over excited voice hold it
schreber and white freeze in mid struggle look at the inspector
behind him the nurse appears in the hallway
he tried to kill me
everybody stay calm
bumstead steps into the light shoves his gun in whites face handcuffs him
bumstead searches white finds the revolver takes this
also takes his wallet
he glances at the doctor who hides the syringe behind his back
bumstead to doctor you schreber
schreber nods blankly
bumstead runs his hand over whites side pocket feels something
white says nothing
the inspector opens the pocket and looks in
bumstead disgusted a fish huh
an old fashioned black sedan drives over a rusty suspension bridge
stone gargoyles look down at the lone vehicle
its been raining
streets are empty
white and the inspector drive silently
bumstead has appointed his un marked police vehicle with all the comforts of home
note pad holder complete with light
a system for everything
glances at his watch im curious
how many so far
he shakes his watch puts it to his ear
white confused what
bumstead counts on fingers lets see theres the little guy with no arms or legs
and the young boy
white disturbed young boy
close on white frightened now
the six year old
sure you remember
bumstead pulls something from under the dashboard
a sandwich carefully wrapped and prepared
after glancing at his watch again he bites into it
bumstead chewing yknow the kid you left in the meat packing plant cut into pieces
packed into brown paper parcels wrapped in twine that kind of thing
you sure have demonstrated a great deal of
the baby was the best though
several cops lost their lunch over that one
head twisted off spine pulled out yeech
white cuts in stop it
youre making me sick
we count seven so far
anyone we missed
radio crackle o
a tinny voice cuts in
bumstead picks up a microphone speaks into it
what is it crenshaw
just reminding you
your eight pee em
looks at watch very efficient as usual crenshaw
remind me to give you my watch
it needs fixing
bumstead replaces the microphone under the dashboard takes a sharp corner as he finishes off the sandwich
where are we going
burastead pulls out a small brush cleans the fallen crumbs from his trousers keeping a hand on the wheel
white is silent his wounds continue to bother him
he leans down to scratch through his trousers
white quietly shit
white looks up i didnt sneeze
the inspectors car pulls up and stops
what are we doing here
bumstead grabs a bunch of flowers off the back seat
bumstead pushes the handcuffed white through a swinging metal door
they enter a sterile air conditioned room
an effeminate male nurse sits behind a glassed in counter
directly opposite is a small waiting room through a glass panelled door
bumstead pushes white into this room
the inspector shuts the door behind him
white looks about the blank room takes a seat
he can see bumstead through the glass panel in the door walk up to the male nurse opposite
the inspector talks to the male nurse through a tiny opening in the window
im here to see my mother
he cannot hear anything of what bumstead is saying
he sees him take out his wallet and show his badge
the male nurse is concerned looks over towards white then opens a drawer hands bumstead a key
the inspector steps back to the waiting room door and locks it from the outside
he looks at white for a moment then walks away along the corridor
bumstead enters darkness pneumatic machine noise fills the gloom
he walks quietly to his mother encased in a metallic contraption something like an iron lung
bumstead whisper brought you these
he places flowers on the bedside table
his mother just stares expressionless into space in a coma
he sits on a metal chair looks at the woman
her life sustaining machines hiss and breathe
a finger presses down on the sticky surface of a page
it pulls away revealing an inky finger print
white is standing in a bare room in front of a finger printing machine
a blast of electrical feed back
white looks up at a speaker mounted to the wall
mechanical voice through speaker move forward
white follows a painted line on the floor stands against a wall in front of an old fashioned camera
a slot opens in the wall behind him mechanical arms spring forward restrain him one arm holds a sign with a number in front of him
a flash goes off the click of a shutter
a claw lowers from the ceiling grips whites head turns it abruptly the camera fires
the claw turns his head the other way
the camera fires again
across the room a buzzer sounds a red light flashes above a door
white is released by the mechanical hands walks over opens the door and steps into darkness
lights come on extremely bright
a room for line ups markings on the white wall behind white indicate varying heights a darkened window faces him
he is obviously to be identified by an unseen person
a buzzer sounds again a light indicates another door
white moves into another room
a chair faces a large wheel painted in a black and white spiral
he sits down the wheel turns faster and faster
watch the wheel
the wheel stops after several seconds
the next room is full of scientific equipment
stand behind the screen
white sees a metal frame x ray machine he steps across to it
the screen lights up filling the room with a green glow
we can see the shape of his skeleton
where his pocket would be is the tiny skeleton of the fish
the next room is empty
face the wall
as soon as he has done this hears a door open behind him
blows rain down on him fists boots clubs
he slides to the floor
the lights go out
lights come on again
white is dazed in a chair a bright light in his face blinds him
whats your name
white squints into light i dont remember
white shakes his head slowly and looks at the floor
the light is angled away pointed down towards a table
white can see now
a featureless room
stromboli stands over him behind him is bumstead and two shadowy guards
bumstead picks up an envelope removes a series of photos hands these to stromboli
he throws the first shot down on the table in front of white
a black and white police photo of a murder victim
another photo goes down
another and another
each more grisly than the last
youll sign a confession
hes looks utterly lost
bumstead steps across to a small speaker box on the wall near the only door presses a button
bumstead into speaker okay
two guards immediately step through the door grab white by his arms
they carry him off
white is woken by a uniformed guard shining a light in his eyes
white is led into an empty pale green room with a glass barrier down the middle
the guard tells him to sit and wait
the door on the other side of the barrier opens with a squeak doctor schreber steps in looking frightened
white to guard keep him away hes insane
the guard just smiles looks at the doctor knowingly
please stay calm
white to guard this man wants to kill me
the guard remains indifferent
schreber to guard just one of his many delusions its nothing
a whisper to white shut up
listen damn you
this is a fortunate coincidence we wont get another chance like this
listen to me
white turns to doctor what do you want
still a whisper you didnt kill anyone
white sarcastic what am i doing in here then
listen to what i have to say
decide for yourself
the dark silhouettes of bumstead and another cop watch from behind a two way mirror
whats he doing here
says he is the mans doctor
taps side of his head you know
know its his doctor
into intercom i need the file on
reads clip board daniel paul schreber m
isnt that his doctor
bumstead evenly yes
beat and its with an h
the inspector looks up from the speaker
through the mirror white seems to have calmed down
the men in black theyre the killers
white stands abruptly pushes himself against the glass
youre a liar
no its the truth
so youre telling me the truth this time
is that it
the doctor removes a small syringe from his black bag places it on the table in front of the glass blocks it from the guards view
if you would only take this inject it in your brain everything would be much clearer
not that again
everyone gets one very much like this
points to syringe but this ones special
it will help you understand everything
white cuts in im not injecting anything into my brain
anton i mean john there has been an experiment a dangerous experiment
i arranged it
it was a lie from the beginning
it almost worked but things did not go as they should have
you have been left blank
schreber waves frantically at the air surrounding him
you can change this all this
points at syringe again but you must take it
white stares blankly at him for a moment then youve been working too hard
dont be foolish
time is short
let me show you something
look at this syringe
dont ask stupid questions
look at it
white reluctantly does this
imagine the syringe rising
picture it floating above the table
the syringe starts to vibrate actually rises into the air floats stationary between white and schreber
its a trick
no it isnt
you are doing it
now raise it over the glass and
suddenly the syringe spins towards the doctor impales itself in his shoulder
he yelps grabs it
the doctor pulls out the syringe is about to say more when a your time is up
schreber looks to where the voice came from a speaker above their heads
schreber looks at white i gave you your chance now its too late
theyll learn you are here soon
its all over
doctor schreber paces towards the exit
bumstead steps in front of him
the doctor is startled
what brings you here
just visiting my patient
and how is his state of mind
hes seriously disturbed
the doctor is nervous glancing about
you seem a little edgy
yes of course
he tries to push past
bumstead grabs his arm
to tell you the truth im glad weve run into each other like this
maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends
schreber looks like a trapped animal when bumstead
bumasead turns to look down the corridor
he sees stromboli peaking out of his office door
i need to speak to you
the door shuts again
bumstead turns back
the doctor is gone the corridor empty
white is staring through a glass door at a cop
a kettle whistles o
the cop gets up and moves off
white looks up
a small window high up on the wall
impossible to get to even if his hands werent cuffed
nothing he can do he looks at a clock on a wall
push in on the clock ticking gets louder
bumstead enters strombolis office
a nervous chief inspector is flanked by two strange looking men in ill fitting brown suits
er gentlemen are here to collect white
bumstead suspiciously eyes the two men beside strombolis desk
bumstead to men who are you
stromboli even more nervous please bumstead
co operate its easier
this is highly irregular
i have a right to know
we are from a mental asylum
he notices that this mans moustache is lop sided
the other man wears spectacles with no lenses in the frames clutches an un lit pipe in his teeth
hes ill he needs expert help
has he been displaying any strange
hes been a little angel
if you could show them to the holding cell now
slow move in on bumsteads face
bumstead and the mystery men walk towards the holding cell
bumstead glances up through the glass in the door before he enters
he fumbles furiously for the key in his pocket bursts into the room
white is gone
bumstead throws a look back to the front desk
where is he
the cop is just returning holding a cup of coffee
he looks at the inspector sees the room is empty
a nervous twitch knocks the cup from the cops hands
tight on the cup smashing on the floor
constant noise o
of trains arriving and departing but none are seen
camera moves past broken tiles on a wall to reveal white sitting amidst rubbish on the ground looking around confused groggy from sleep
he looks down at his hands unsuccessfully tries to free them from the cuffs
he starts to cry
he puts his head in his hands his body spasms with each sob
several angles of the empty corridors of the subway
whites crying is heard echoic
back on white a small feminine hand touches his head
startled he throws himself back like hes about to be attacked
the beautiful japanese woman from the church looks down at him
bumstead and the cop are getting grilled by stromboli
but i dont understand how it was possible
the only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall he was cuffed
shouts at cringing how could you have been so stupid
im sorry sir
alright get out
bumstead gets up and leaves
the cop hustles out shuts the door
bumstead youre starting to annoy me
this case is very important to me
just a little warning ive got my eye on you inspector remember that
white awkwardly trying to hide his cuffed hands in his coat follows the japanese woman up a flight of dark stairs
she keeps looking back at him smiling but says nothing
white and the woman step into a run down apartment
she points to a couch
white looks uncomfortable
she smiles again then turns on the radio
she steps into an adjoining bedroom leaving white alone
he gets up and starts to tune the radio
a babble of fragments of voices and music then a news report
earlier this evening it was reported a man fitting his description had been apprehended
white listens nervously
and now for a message from lump o food products
across the room he can see the womans bedroom door ajar
he crosses to the doorway and looks in
the woman stands naked against a deep red wall her back turned
she has an elaborate tattoo on her back looks like an insect
she puts on a dressing gown and turns suddenly
white steps back before she notices him he goes back to the couch
she steps from the doorway holding a bar of soap in her hand
she sits down beside white and takes his hands gently lathering soap around the handcuffs continuing to smile at him
white looks down
his hands seem to have shrunk they poke out of his sleeves like tiny childrens limbs
the cuffs effortlessly slip off
white looks at the woman then back at his hands nothing strange they are normal size but somehow the cuffs have been removed
he looks at the woman again grateful
he cant help smiling
she leans forward goes out of she touches her tongue to his lips
kisses his face
she pushes him back on the couch and pulls her dressing gown open
white does not respond seems uncertain
she sits upright astride his body unbuckles his belt opens his shirt caresses his chest
she stops her face in shadow
slowly white lifts his hands to her breasts touches them
she starts to breath deeply
out of focus their bodies entangle begin to move rhythmically
the camera tracks sideways reveals a microphone behind a chair leads us to a mirror on a wall
on the other side of the one way glass a reel to reel tape recorder is picking up the sounds of heavy breathing
the building the lovers are in slowly rises into the air past taller buildings and floats out over the city
its shadow moves past empty plazas and across faces of grey towers
white sleeps as buildings move past outside the window
he opens his eyes forces himself awake
looks across the dark room
the japanese woman stands naked at the window clutching a large red megaphone
in perfect english she shouts down at the streets drifting past
hes up here
he raped me
before he kills again
mystery men stand on roof tops watching the building drift past
white runs to the window grabs the woman
as they struggle the building is landing softly in another part of the city
long shadows move towards the entrance
white wakes up again finds he is still on the couch
no sign of the woman
then he notices her standing by the window minus megaphone
the wind pulls at her black hair
a distant siren o
he gets up walks over stands beside her looks out at the dark city
she ignores him goes back to the couch turns on a table lamp puts her hands before the lit bulb casts animal shadows on the wall
white watches her
he walks across and sits next to her
she points to herself
woman a whisper sachiko
he nods slowly looks at her
she waits for him to respond with his name
he shrugs remains silent
then he puts his hands in the light makes his own animal shadow
im a shadow
she smiles at the shadows
do i look like a murderer to you
she just keeps smiling not understanding
he notices an old phone on a corner table removes the note again and rings the same number
this time after several rings the call is answered
who is this
white remains silent
sachiko stands and leaves the room
john is that you
who is this
what do you know about me
in the darkness of a doorway sachiko hesitates momentarily
she slides a hand into whites coat removes the wallet
she takes out some cash puts the wallet back then she moves off
bumstead pulls up in his car
across the street is doctor schrebers surgery
he is about to get out of the car when the surgery door opens and a figure steps into the street
bumstead watches the shadowy man for a moment
then gets out and follows assuming it is schreber
bumstead follows inconspicuously
without warning the figure stops and turns
bumstead backs into a doorway to hide
he gets a glimpse of the gaunt features of a mystery man in the dim light of the alley
when bumstead steps into the alley again there is no sign of the man like he disappeared into thin air
a shadow crosses the wall beside bumstead
he spins looking around behind him
then he looks up into the air
the shadow of a levitating figure crosses the face of a building
sound of a woman sobbing o
a wet dog sits in a corner gnawing a bone
a crackly voice recites a list of names from a small speaker box mounted to a wall
a trembling finger presses a door buzzer
sachiko opens the door and looks out
angle on a strange woman in the dark corridor adjusting her hair nervously
she pushes past the japanese woman into the room
white stands inside the room looking at the woman expressionless
the woman suddenly leaps forward grabs him kisses him passionately
white tries to push her away but she takes his hand pulls it inside her dress makes him touch her breasts
he pushes harder she trips on a chair falls to the floor
she starts to cry
the camera moves past flaking bricks to a window
behind the glass white and sachiko sit across from the woman who attacked white
she is talking though nothing can be heard drying her eyes with a handkerchief
the strange woman looks at white intently between sobs
please believe me
its me john
your i wouldnt lie to you
you told me i could come and see you now you want to just send me away again
white looks at the floor
a crack in the floorboards movement underneath
i thought it would make more sense
im getting the pieces but when i put it together it feels like
like youre telling me about somebody elses life
its the truth
i need you
i know youre innocent
how do you know im innocent
of course you are
you couldnt do those terrible things
come home with me maybe things will make sense then
i cant do that
what about my parents
do you know where i can find them
theyre dead john
he stands and walks to the window looks out at the city
you have an uncle
you were very close
she fumbles in her handbag pulls out a notebook scribbles something on a piece of paper hands it to white
this is where he lives
im sure he would like to see you
white taking paper thanks
wife looks at him for a beat dont you want me
remember how my skin feels
she notices sachiko becomes self conscious
sachiko silently stands and leaves the room
the wife puts her face in her hands overcome with tears
whats your name
wife looks up still sobbing elizabeth
white removes the torn fragment of the photograph he has in his wallet holds the black and white eye up to her face it matches
white thoughtful yes
in the darkness of a doorway sachiko watches the couple
she i want to help
he pulls the postcard from his wallet holds it up so the woman can see it
know this place
she looks at the card
elizabeth stops crying of course
your home town where you grew up
white stands abruptly startling the woman
he glares down at her intensely
how do i get there
she trails off into silence
her hand about to point in a certain direction freezes in mid air
strange i forgot
white sits back down quietly
sachiko locks the door behind her and steps to the middle of the room lifts a small round rug off the tiled floor
underneath is a trap door
opening it she climbs down a hole
in the semi darkness she moves to a wooden box
she cranks a small metal handle on the box which makes the lid open
music plays softly
she looks into the yawning black mouth of the box
a worm like apparition threads its way out of the hole wraps about her thigh
she breaths deeply shuts her eyes
low angle tracking shot feet walk along a tattered rug approach a door
bumsteads shoes shiny as always
a knock on the door startles a huddled man in a blanket sitting before a small t
this is thompson the detective with mental problems
hes unshaven haunted
clutching a shotgun he steps to the door peeks through a spy hole
bumstead back turned glancing at his watch
thompson backs away points his gun at the figure through the door
open up thompson
thompson puts his eye to the door again
through the spy hole lens the inspector turns looks at us his face distorted fish like
thompson undoes four locks opens the door a crack but leaves it chained
cant let you in
im on the serial killer case need to talk
thompson wipes at the sweat on his forehead
you dont look so well
cmon let me in thompson
thompson stares at bumstead then silently unchains the door and lets him through
i cant talk about that as long as you understand thats all
the room is very dark
bumstead is assailed by a wave of putrid smells
its a mess rotten food overturned furniture dirty clothes
pull up some garbage make yourself at home
thompson smiles weakly
they sit down face each other in the gloom
a rat scuttles past thompson
with lightning reflexes he throws a shoe at it
the rat runs under a table
he looks back at bumstead smiles slightly insane
theyve taken my mind my memories
is that your idea of a joke
i dont remember
looks around take my advice bumstead
get off this case
what is going on
thompson looks more frightened wish i could tell you bumstead
he screams horribly
stands clutching his head
startled bumstead falls backwards off his chair
thompson still clutching his head runs and starts pounding his face against the wall
leave me alone
thompsons head is changing bloating
it rapidly elongates into a pink fleshy tube
thompsons head continues to grow his features are lost beneath folds of skin
his screaming is stifled
thompson falls to the floor
his head huge now larger than his body
small tendrils sprout from the main appendage
bumstead takes cover behind a sofa
then as violently as the head began to transform it stops
bumstead peaks over the sofa at the huge throbbing purple growth sprouting from thompsons collar
at the top of the growth an orifice opens
an explosion of green bile spouts into the room covers everything in sight
then the head starts to shrink
thompsons features appear again
it returns to normal size
thompson groans sprawled on the floor clutching his head
bumstead looks on in horror
its its disgusting i know
thompsons face is heavily bruised covered in sweat
his nose starts to bleed he wipes it on his sleeve
we have to get you to a doctor
bumstead stands unsteadily
how long has this been happening
a few days
a few weeks dunno i cant remember
stands slowly worse thing is i never know if it will change back again
now please leave me alone
white elizabeth and sachiko sit around a small table eating quietly
without warning elizabeth starts to cry again
white tries to ignore her
sachiko looks sadly at the wife puts a hand on her shoulder gives her a handkerchief
the woman quietens down
they resume eating but in no time elizabeth again bursts into tears
white looks at her now
elizabeth through sobs sorry
sachiko leans across and puts her arm around elizabeth helps her to her feet
elizabeth hangs onto the woman as she is led from the room
white can hear the sobbing still as the women move through to the bedroom
they sit on the edge of the bed sachiko holds elizabeths hand smiles at her
elizabeth calmer now im sorry
this is embarrassing my husband doesnt know who i am
with this she starts to cry again
sachiko leans forward and tenderly kisses elizabeths lips
tight on two mystery men speaking in whispers
the men continue talking as the camera rises through several levels of concrete and machinery to reveal other mystery men are rigging a wire to some kind of antenna device
the group of mystery men have gathered once again
one addresses them all
the line of junction between two edges
men unison we have located him
now is the time yes
a switch is thrown
electricity sparks to life
a hum is in the air
let the tuning commence
the congregation of men place electrodes to their foreheads in a trance like manner
they chant quietly at first steadily building in volume
the men stand and move rhythmically to some inner beat
the camera moves across to a diagram pinned on a board
a representation of a mans legs
trousers rolled up above the knees showing a number of bite like wounds on the flesh
labels point out various parts of the legs in medical fashion the legends are an unknown language
the antenna glows with a ghostly green light
screams white downs a cup of black coffee staring blankly out the window
he glances across to a wall notices a fly there something about it looks wrong
a distorted electronic image of whites face looming up
at exactly that moment the fly takes off flies erratically down the hall around a turn and disappears
white moves quietly towards the bedroom door
it is ajar dark inside
the women are naked on the bed
the japanese woman has her eyes shut head back in ecstasy
the wife is bent over her kissing her stomach
angle on white watching through the crack in the door
the women are oblivious
he moves away slowly feeling strange
his feet stop making contact with the floor
he grabs a table to steady himself
the table cloth comes away things spill to the floor and smash
white desperately reaches out to grab something holds the light fixture in the ceiling
it breaks off in a cloud of plaster
sparks briefly illuminate
he falls heavily onto the ceiling now the floor
the apartment is upside down
he stares up at furniture and objects
white steps into the room eerily illuminated by a glowing heater stuck to the floor
water is running filling the tub and overflowing making a suspended puddle above whites head
white takes off his clothes and climbs the wall towards the floor
its difficult but he reaches the tap turns it off
pulls himself towards the tub
gravity becomes normal again as he sinks in the warm water
hes incredibly weak floats limply in the bath
submerges his face
a distant throbbing o
like a huge machine heart somewhere in the building
he opens his eyes still underwater stares up at the ceiling
a blurry dark figure moves into his vision
it stares down at him
white rigid with fright cannot focus on the figure through the thin veil of water
the figure reaches out
a gloved hand grabs white about the throat holds him forcefully
white gulps for air swallows water
his eyes widen
he tries to stop the hand strangling him but cant
suddenly the hand pulls away
the blurry figure stumbles back and erupts into bloody explosion
the body splits apart throwing internal organs through the room
white awakens in the bathtub
he looks about the room
he gets out of the water starts to dress
bumsteads car pulls up
he gets out stained here and there with bile
a high angle on the slain bodies of the japanese woman and whites wife
two cops wander about the dark room doing stuff
bumstead walks up to the cop in charge
all the same entry wounds
its definitely him
indicates sachikos corpse she lives
the other one
looks around wheres the photographer
no one available
a third young cop steps up to the cop in charge glancing at the bile on bumsteads suit
they wont come out
well interrogate them anyway
the cop leads bumstead behind a wooden partition
a small area neatly arranged a double bed various possessions
someone obviously lives here
the room is empty however
this is the family of the victim apparently they were in the apartment when he committed
bumstead looks around empty room what are you talking about
he walks to the bed bends over and lifts the bed spread
in the shadows underneath bumstead can make out several faces
a man an old woman three or four children
they dont speak english
how will we interrogate them
i dont know exactly
under the bed bumstead can see a little girl
he walks over to her
she puts a hand over her mouth edges away
i wont hurt you
without coming out from under the bed she hands the inspector a crumpled paper
he looks at it then glances over his shoulder
the wooden room divider
the camera moves in steadily into a crack running along the length of the divider we can see the room on the other side with the cops moving about
bumstead looks back at the page he holds in his hands
a child like drawing
two men stick figures dressed in black with impossibly big knifes slash at two screaming women
unmistakable mystery men
doctor schreber walks stiffly into the room and sits at the head of a boardroom table
hes cold pulls his coat up about his neck
the long table is lined on both sides with immobile a dark figure walks into the room steps up to the other end of the table
this is the enigmatic mister black only ever seen hidden in shadow
mister black addressing men gentlemen
peers at schreber doctor
he sits dark and mysterious
i have called this meeting for a purpose yes
turns to schreber it is clear to you we are unhappy yes
yes of course
the tuning failed when our agents arrived he was gone
he knows things predicts things
explain to us doctor
why is the situation this way
schreber seems distinctly uncomfortable
im not certain i fully understand myself
no excuses dearest doctor
mystery men chant in unison answers
you said this would be containable
nothing works this time
why is this so
i ah i
its a little cold in here dont you think
we must find him
this is your responsibility
schreber thinking fast yes of course
bumstead once again scratches his head in front of a map
the little girls drawing is pinned to his board
his attention wanders
he notices a fly crawling across the wall in front of his face
he leans closer studying it
the intercom crackles to life
the insect flies off
miss crenshaw through intercom a call sir
who is it
says he must talk to you
put it through
a light flashes
bumstead picks up
this is bumstead
who is this
he listens intently
he looks nervous
his secretary sits at her desk in an adjoining office filing her nails
i need everything on the jonathan white case
everything all the important stuff
wrap it up for me
the inspector turns to face her a little manic
she is staring at him
please im in a hurry
miss crenshaw evenly certainly
bumstead steps from the doorway and walks across to his car briskly
bumstead moves down a long corridor full of people in towels and swimming outfits waiting silently
they sit lined by a wall staring into space
bumstead walks into a larger tiled room full of steam
he walks beside a heated pool naked people swim about weakly or sit on the edge washing themselves
he steps up to a fully dressed man sitting silently on a bench
it is white
a feint smile brushes across whites lips as he looks up at the inspector
he looks away like hes forgotten something
stands walks over to the pool cups his hand bends down scoops some water
bumstead sees white has picked up the little silver fish
why give yourself up
i ah couldnt think of anything else to do
i thought maybe you know something
beat im scared
that was a pretty good escape act at the station
how did you do that
i woke up in a subway
i dont know how i got there
bumstead not convinced uh huh
pauses what are you scared of
i dont know who they are
why are they after you
dont know that either
dont know much do you
piano accordion music wafts on a breeze someone breathing
high angle down through an opening metal hatch
a dim laboratory is revealed a maze of scientific instruments
elongated shadows move about
mystery men are hunched over something
behind them a diagrammatic chart of the evolution of the human brain
man bends across to a control panel works a switch
a small speaker in a metal box crackles to life
sound of distant what is your name
what is your name
wires lead from the metal box to a human brain within a metallic container
electricity arches across electrodes
more sounds from the speaker water bubbling
high heels walk man steps forward and pulls a bloodied sheet from their handiwork
a puppet like creature is revealed
small two and half feet tall
the top of its head an open hatch containing the brain
wires lead to this
tight on puppets eyes they glance about the room
its body is a series of geometric shapes and polished surfaces
man shines a torch into the puppets eyes
gears turn illuminated by the beam of the light
the gears part slowly to reveal a small writhing insect screwed to a metal plate
man shows the puppet photographs white as he looks currently shots of him as a teenager a young boy a baby
photos of what we realise are his parents standing on a seaside pier sirtiling and waving
where he went to school
a red push bike he owned as a boy
his first sweetheart
then a photo of a young woman smiling his wife
man holds up a small sea shell to the mechanical ear of the puppet creature more sounds of surf
a figure clutching a wooden cane looks on from the shadows
his pale hand fondles the ornate handle of his cane a carved silver insect
its mister black
man steps up to him
you have duplicated the personality yes
it is ready
the doctor was most helpful
mister black turns towards the other men
i hear a clock in my head and i like it
men respond in unison we hear clocks in our heads and we like it
a world in our likeness
a world in our likeness
the men close the hatch in the top of the puppets head
the puppet tests out its many weapons a series of nasty looking blades snap out of its small body then retract
bumstead leads white through the front door into a sitting room
everything is extremely neat and organized plastic coverings on all the furniture
white steps towards a sofa
not that way
if you could just follow the covering the carpet gets stained and its impossible to clean
bumstead indicates a clear plastic mat running through the room
everything the department knows about john white is in this
hands file excuse me for a moment
white flips through it
details of whites history
bumstead removes an empty suitcase from a closet
begins to place neatly folded clothes within it
bumstead calling to white age thirty one
five feet ten and a half inches tall
until recently worked for a firm manufacturing scientific equipment
wifes name elizabeth
father and mother harold and edith
a history of mental instability
bumstead walks back into the sitting room packed bag in hand
he looks at white leafing through the file
that stuff helpful
white disappointed i suppose
looks up why are you helping me
youre case has been driving me crazy
you see i pride myself on being thorough
theres too many loose ends with your case
a beat thought it was best you were hidden until we understand more about the facts
what do you know about these men in black
white looks up pauses as if he didnt understand bumstead then if you shoot them here
points at his forehead you can kill them
theyre not people like us got insects in their heads
got any disinfectant
the inspector is caught off guard by the question
white continues its my legs
giving me trouble
bumstead walks silently to the bathroom opens a medicine cabinet
bumstead to himself insects
he returns clutching a small bottle and some cotton wool
hands things to white careful with your trousers
that stuff stains
the inspector gives white back his revolver and his wallet
bumstead paces thoughtfully careful to stay on the plastic protective covering
he turns glares at white who dabs his legs with the cotton wool
any idea what part the doctor plays in this business
white shakes head
lets try and find out shall we
points at whites shoe lace is untied
white looks down
bumstead doesnt lie
the barber is shaving under the armpit of a client
grandpa snores in a corner his feet buried under a pile of hair clippings
the bell hanging above the door rings
the door swings open
he with you shortly sir
several heads turn then look down to see the puppet
the puppet wheels forward and stops
barber not really looking hello sonny
mother get it for you
the puppet crosses the room threateningly
two other clients look up startled from their newspapers and girly magazines
on the puppet it wheels up to the barbers leg and grabs his trouser with a mechanical claw
the puppet holds out a photo of white
puppet incoherent obscenities barber looks down scared now huh
hes grabbed and thrown into a nearby chair
the puppet leaps onto the bench in front of him hes frightened so are the customers
puppet wheels up and down on the bench in front of the customers stopping to glance at individuals in a threatening manner holding out the photo of white
it leans forward spinning its blades hair flies
the puppet retracts its weapons covered in blood
it wheels forward through the door and into the street
the camera pans to reveal a scene of complete carnage
blood covers the walls
four bodies slumped about the room
each has an outlandish hairstyle
white looks at the inspector street lights pass over his features
bumstead stares at the road
i didnt tell you the entire reason i helped you
it started with two little girls
used to play with them when i was young
couldnt remember for the life of me what they looked like then i understood why
he looks at the dashboard brushes away a small piece of lint
they didnt have faces
just seamless flesh across the front of their heads
i just hadnt remembered it that way
up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory
looks back at white thats not all
once i started examining them all sorts of things about my life had
it was like a game
i would think about a person or a place or an event
then i would turn the lights off
sit down in a comfortable chair
and study each detail of this subject
he glances at white then back to the road
everything was liquid beneath a thin surface that had always seemed solid to me
bumstead and white are quiet momentarily then is there anything you havent told me about this business
even the most insignificant thing
white thinking no
nothing i can think of
the only thing ive been certain of all this time is that i need to get to the ocean
the point is no one seems to know how to get there
why thats ridiculous
he trails off
shakes his head slowly
well get to the bottom of this
i mean it
the doctor is sitting at his desk when the door bursts open suddenly
white and bumstead move into the room and grab the doctor before he can protest
i met a friend of yours the other night doctor
rather pale skin
i dont know what youre talking about
he was leaving your office at the time
you are mistaken
what are you hiding
i dont know anything
bumstead removes his revolver sticks it in the doctors face
please theyll kill me
i think its time you introduced us to your little friends
schreber bumstead and white sit in bumsteads car in an alleyway
schreber points to a solitary metal door in a wall
just like that
the threesome step from the car keep close to a wall
schreber alone steps up to the door leans down to a mat at the foot of the door lifts it and takes a key from underneath
he unlocks the door opens it puts the key back goes inside
he waves the other men forward
white and bumstead step up to the door bumstead looks at the mat it says welcome on it
through the door an elevator
there is only a down button
schreber presses it several seconds later the doors open
they step inside
the doors close the lift descends
what is this place
you wouldnt believe me if i told you inspector
have patience youll see for yourself
when the doors open again the three men look out on a dark the puppet wheels up to the sweeping set of stairs at the base of the building
it stops wheels bump into the steps repeatedly
it looks down and shrieks with a string of mechanical obscenities
white and bumstead follow schreber down a corridor to what appears to be an ancient crypt
they enter a door it has something written on it in a strange language
they stumble around in the darkness schreber finds a light switch suddenly white stops dead in his tracks bumstead turns to him
white points to a wall featuring a line of brass hooks
on these hooks hang mystery men coats thats not all
each hook carries a face
bumstead and white step closer look at the faces
they seem to be elaborate very life like masks
put them on
white and the inspector look at each other incredulous
the door opens
white bumstead and schreber step out wearing poorly fitting masks and coats disguised as mystery men
the three men come across a small area with a raised platform between arches
a number of open carts roll past on tracks the scene resembles some bizarre amusement park ride
the carts are numbered on the side all of them empty
white bumstead and schreber hop aboard
the cart takes them into a dark tunnel deeper into the secret underworld of the mystery men
they move through a subterranean landscape of unexplained contraptions and bones
to bumstead where do you think this goes
it sure isnt the fun fair
the cart finally comes to a stop in a cave
bumstead white and schreber leap out and hide in a dark doorway as a long line of mystery men walk past them
follow me and do exactly as i do
they join the end of the line falling into step
the men with white bumstead and schreber in tow enter and sit in a number of rows of wooden chairs
white and the inspector do the same
more mystery men appear in circular portals high up on the concrete walls
one man faces the others at the front of the room
eleven past eleven the night of the eye
the seated men start to chant
a man in the front row stands
the eye is too small for the head of the pin
another man stands
next to the first who sits again
what is it that floats on the water
so it goes around the room each man takes his turn announcing part of the strange ritual
it will be white bumstead and schrebers turn shortly
white is worried looks at the others
white whisper what do we do
schreber hisses back fake it
schreber is next he stands abruptly
master of time and space
then its bumsteads turn
the eye um delicious with horseradish on rye
man at the front seems confused for a moment several of the others turn towards bumstead
man uncertain good
the inspector sits back down whispers to white without looking at him
nothing to it
white sits down shaking his head embarrassed
the man next to white rises up keeps rising floats in the air above the mens heads
my spine will bend for the eye
he turns sideways still floating
back above ground bumstead white and schreber run from the door at the end of the alley way tossing their masks away
was that for real down there
im afraid so
the inspector stops walking suddenly grabs white holds him back
what the hell is that
at the end of the alley the puppet advances menacingly
schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and disappears
fortunately bumsteads car stands nearby
the two men leap in start it up
bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the glare of the headlights
the puppets head opens a tiny propeller pops out spins lifting the puppet into the air
the car passes beneath it at speed
screeches off into a street races along between tall buildings
this ocean business
i know where i can find a map
i need to go back to the station
where will you be
white thinks for a moment pulls the paper his wife gave him from his pocket
ill go see an uncle of mine
reading five one eight three double six three
bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash battles with the wheel driving at breakneck speed
looks in rear mirror uh oh
white turns and looks behind them
headlights gaining on them
on the puppet sitting at the wheel of a stolen car driving like crazy
white takes out his gun aims at the rapidly approaching car
white remembers its empty
bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat
the puppet pulls alongside a mechanical arm extends towards bumsteads front tire
a spinning blade extends from the end of the mechanical arm
tight on the blade heading for the spinning wheel
shells hit the puppets car shattering windows
the blade cuts into the tire it pops loudly goes flat metal sparks off the road
white is thrown forward hits his head on the dash
bumstead fights to keep control swerves into the side of the other vehicle making it scrape a concrete wall hits garbage cans flying
the puppets car falls behind then swerves off into a side street and disappears
bumstead looks behind him where did it go
white looks back also dont know
both look forward again to see the puppets car pull out in front of them blocking the way
bumsteads car is going too fast
slams the brakes
tight on puppet screaming with insane joy as bumsteads car approaches like a bullet
bumstead rips the phone number from the pad
the two men leap
the car continues onwards
in the glow of the flaming wrecks the two men pick themselves up from different sides of the street
look at each other turn and head in opposite directions
camera moves in on mangled metal a mechanical claw starts to pull itself from the wreckage
white steps up to a small door in the side of a building
a sign above the door depicts an underwater scene crammed with fish sea weed bubbles floating to the surface
dominating everything is a green man with scales a king neptune type
white stops in front of a ticket booth beside a faded blue curtain
in the booth a ticket seller is snoring with his mouth hanging open his head sagging
white knocks on the window
the man wakes with a start
thats what i said
looks at white rubs head what
im looking for this address
the man squints at the card white holds up nods groggily
he thumbs the blue curtain
curls up shuts his eyes again
a dark room full of bubbling noises and water dripping an aquarium
several corridors meander between large glass panels that look into illuminated tanks of sea creatures
white moves past a shadowy doorway
he can barely make out white moves cautiously in the darkness
on a door a tiny nameplate says k
the door is unlocked
he opens it and goes in
an entrance hall of an apartment
a large number of mounted fish of all sizes line the hall
photos on the wall family portraits
white examines these concentrates on one in particular a young boy on a red push bike in the background a sign with a faded image of a girl in a
bathing suit welcome to blumbville
a strange whirring noise o
white hides behind a sofa
whatever is making the whirring noise moves past slowly
white cannot see what it is
white turns to see an old man in his pyjamas sitting in a wheelchair
the man pushes a lever on the side of the chair
a whir of electric motors
the chair carries him out of the shadows
white steps from behind the sofa
are you alright
what are you doing here
is this one of your jokes john
its been so long i thought youd forgotten your uncle karl
moving through a dark claustrophobic pipe
twisting around tight corners darting down straight lengths of ducting
dim light spills from wire grills spaced along the walls
we travel up to one grill at the end of a long stretch of tunnel stop nowhere left to go
we can see through the gaps in the wire looking down into
white and uncle karl are having a slide show
shots of a recent vacation the uncle doing a series of mundane things
karl chuckling not often i get a chance to show these
he changes the slide an image of him standing against a brick wall
and this is me again about um i would guess about twelve feet further to the right of the last shot
now just behind the wall is the hotel i stayed at sweet little place
the phone rings
uncle karl wheels over picks up the receiver
karl talks down the line hello
yes hes here
holds out the phone to white its for you
white concerned takes the phone
he listens oh its you
my uncle apparently
just looking at some memories
bumstead talks to white on the phone
he stands in a dark room surrounded by charts and maps
at first i thought there was no way to get to the ocean
the buildings are a barrier no windows no doors everything just well ends only thing would be drill a hole
but then i saw it one door just one
inside a tenement building
bumstead is interrupted by a noise o
he looks to a frosted partition dark figures walk past on the other side
he quickly sorts through several maps making as little noise as he can
bumstead whisper we can meet later but first i have to do something
look i got to go
white holds the phone listens to bumstead on the other end
where can we meet
as white hangs up he notices a door behind a big old crockery cupboard
the cupboard has been pushed up against the wall hiding the door
bumstead quickly folds the map and shoves it into his pocket
as he turns and runs from the room we notice a dark figure standing behind a shelf in the room
uncle karl continues to change slides the noise echoing about the room
white moves over and sits down next to him
this is a good one
what is that door
behind the cabinet
where does it go
the uncle watches the slides
such a joker
like your father
have a look
he leads the old man over to the cabinet
you see it
where does it lead
it must be a closet or something
white pushes at the cabinet
the old man helps
they only manage to push several inches it is very heavy
white decides to just climb over it
he squeezes through opens the door and climbs a set of dark stairs
uncle karl watches
dont trip over
its dark up there
tight on a light switch it is flipped
an attic full of books boxes discarded possessions
white picks up a book and opens it the pages have been eaten out by a swarm of roaches
he drops it in disgust as the insects scurry over his hands
in a small wooden box are several toys he examines with great interest
at the bottom of the box he finds a small dog eared drawing book
on the cover is a colourful scrawl in childs writing a title answers by jonathan white age nine
white sits down and flips through the book in the dim light
page after page is filled with neat handwriting and drawings
as he reads segments from the book he seems more and more disturbed
he flips through faster and faster
pages flip past stopping occasionally
glimpses of diagrams
the mystery men and their world
cross sections of the mystery men the cavity in their head with the insects inside clearly illustrated
push in close on white
he looks up stunned
white emerges from the attic clutching the small book to his chest lost in thought
he steps quietly into a hall way notices the old man putting the phone back on its cradle
john i didnt see you there
a noise o
white and uncle karl turn
a ventilation grill falls off a wall revealing a hole
eyes shine from the darkness
the puppet leaps from the hole
its blades unfolding spinning wildly before it hits the carpet
it faces the two men
what is that white to karl get back
he wheels forward attempting to scare the puppet off
the puppet goes for uncle karl
a whirr of metal blood splashes across white and the walls
uncle karl screams horribly
white grabs a chair holds it above him
the puppet turns from the dead man in the wheelchair
white lets it have it
the chair crashes down splintering into pieces
the puppet is dazed but immediately recovers
white has a fire poker now
as the puppet advances he swings connecting with the creature hurtling it across the room into a wall
white runs out the door
he leaps into a waiting elevator
pushes the top floor button
the elevator shaft the elevator moves upwards
white looks through the circular window in the door
floor after floor slides past deserted
he looks at the floor indicator
tight on numbers lighting up
then the elevator stops the doors open looking down a dark corridor
the puppet is at the end
it turns to face him suddenly races forward a horrible high pitched shriek from its mechanical voice box
white stabs the buttons of the elevator frantically the doors wont close
the puppet is upon him
he jumps straight up
it goes under him crashing into the back of the elevator
white hits the down button one last time and leaps out of the compartment as the doors close
a mechanical extendible arm shoots out and grabs white around the ankle
drags him across floor
the puppet shrieks wildly again as
its arm is jammed in the closing doors now
the puppet squeals
the arm snaps off
white stands pulls dislocated arm off his ankle
he can hear the elevator descending
suddenly it stops starts returning to his floor
white turns and runs again
the lift doors burst open the enraged creature emerges and races after him
he tears around a corner finds himself in a dead end
nowhere to go
he can hear the puppet approaching along the corridor
suddenly he notice a grill on a wall above his head
he pulls it off climbs into an incredibly tight pipe
he sees a light ahead
he kicks the grill off
a sudden gust of wind
the pipe leads to the outside of the building nowhere to go except a hundred stories straight down
he screams almost falls
turns to start crawling back
suddenly the end of the pipe fills with whirring metal blades
the puppet has followed him in and is advancing
no choice he looks out the hole
sees a pipe on the outside of the building running vertically near the opening
it looks impossible but its his only chance
he climbs out balancing himself on the lip of the opening reaches for the pipe
the puppet is almost upon him
he swings across gets a hand on the pipe
he slips dangles holding on one hand on the pipe one on the edge of the hole
the pipe is greasy slippery cant grip it
suddenly he hears a mechanical clicking turns to see the puppet standing on the edge of the hole inches from his hand
a soft noise reverberates in its voice box a mechanical giggle
a circular blade on one of its arms starts up moves down onto whites hand
tight on his eyes sweat beads and runs down his forehead
tight on the blade as it cuts into flesh
blood spatters whites face as he grimaces with intense pain
he cant hold on
he falls plummets through space
a group of surgeons stand about bumsteads mother on her life support machinery
the surgeons have face masks on and are in deep shadow
the woman stares blankly still in a coma
bumstead looks up from his wristwatch
i cant wait any longer
he is standing in front of the male nurse in the glassed in counter
i told you she is being examined
he turns and storms off down the corridor
the nurse stands shouting after him
one of the doctors leans down and grabs a handful of wires leading out of a box beside the woman
we will teach the pig to meddle in our affairs
he pulls the wires out in a burst of electrical sparks all the machines die
the woman comes to life momentarily starts to claw at the glass shield in front of her face like she is suffocating
the life drains from her weak body and she is angle on the door it bursts open
bumstead is standing there
the masked surgeons are startled they turn rapidly to face him
bumstead steps forward what is happening
ah inspector bumstead
we are glad you are here im afraid we have done all we can
your mother has passed
bumstead turns towards his mother
but she was getting better
we are sorry
the cancer it was fatal
bumstead turns to the men confusion in his eyes
she doesnt have cancer
the men glance at each other for a moment then back at the inspector
we knew that
the other men nod anyway she is dead
bumstead leaps forward rips off one of the surgeons masks
angle on the man he turns to look at bumstead pale skin staring eyes a mystery man
two other men grab him from behind
bumstead struggles ill kill you all
one of the mystery men steps up to the struggling inspector places the palm of his hand across bumsteads eyes
you will obey us yes
in your mind there is a dark space
bumsteads hand reaches out fumbles at a tray of surgical implements grabs a scalpel
he cuts into the hand of one of the men holding him spins and drives the scalpel into the forehead of the mystery man attempting to hypnotise him
the other men leap towards him
his eyes are shut tight
he opens them slowly looks around curious why he isnt dead
white floats in mid air hovering ten feet or so above a dark body of water
he looks amazed
shuts his eyes rubs them opens them again
he clenches his fists and tenses his body
slowly he starts to move forward hovering at an even height over the water
several angles feature the figure of white levitating across the harbour past half sunken buildings and rusted ships
tight on white he comes to a stop
smiles in amazement
then he suddenly plummets into the water like a trap door has opened beneath him
angle on bubbles floating to the surface
whites face rises slowly out of the water
a small object floats towards the ground at the end of a tiny white parachute
he swims across to a small boat climbs aboard pushes himself silently through the still canals of the city
oil tankers move silently through inky water
white paddles the boat to the bottom of a pier climbs a rotten ladder
he runs off into the shadows
the puppet cuts through the waves pushed along by a rear propeller
it reaches the pier climbs to the top
the prop retracts and the creature wheels forward slowly onto a concrete surface
it looks around it knows white is there somewhere
a trail of wet footprints on the ground
it follows them is led to a crane cabin
inside the cranes cabin is white a lunatic grin on his face at the controls
a noise o
startles the puppet
it looks up
follows the crane up into the air
the crane is swinging around against the dark sky
a huge metal container dangles stops above the puppet
nice knowing you
tight on whites hand it pulls a lever
the container shakes and starts to fall
the puppet screams up at the plummeting container
the container crashes into the ground crushing the creature
dust floats in the air
he looks a mess clutching a bleeding gash in his side cuts on his face clothes torn but he made it out alive
bumstead sits on the ground leans against a wall breathing heavily hes losing a lot of blood
a noise o
startles him a figure in the shadows across the roof
its too big to be white
the man steps from the shadows
stromboli walking forward hello bumstead
hes holding a gun levelled at the inspector
bumstead lies bleeding against the wall
he points his own gun at the advancing man and pulls the trigger
stromboli is upon him grabs the empty gun throws it away picks up the inspector leans him against the wall
without stromboli holding him up bumstead would not be able to stand
why do you always have to find things out the hard way
couldnt you just do your job you idiot
i told you didnt i
these people are not playing games bumstead
they can do anything they want dont you understand
bumstead a hiss youre one of them
stromboli laughing in a way we all are inspector
stromboli carries bumstead towards the edge of the roof
he keeps laughing
time for that early retirement bumstead
didnt bring the gold watch im afraid
bumstead weakly no
the edge looms up a long drop to the street
white paces nervously through empty streets
he stops to get his bearings then turns and runs into a silhouetted figure in a bizarre metal contraption on wheels
a skeletal hand reaches out to white grabs his arm
an inhuman moan
terrorised white pulls back
the mechanized figure trundles forward pins him to a wall
a streetlight reveals
doctor schreber covered in blood encased in a metal framework covered in silver blades
what happened to you
the blades are connected to the wheels they turn when he moves forward metal cuts into his flesh slowly skinning him alive
a torture machine
between screams of intense pain the doctor speaks
i had to ahhhh find you
the doctor shuts his eyes a trickle of blood runs down his face
what is it
living in their dreams
schreber turns and rolls off into the night screaming blades spin furiously peeling back flesh
he glances at white one last time
white is running
as he approaches the building he hears a scream looks up to see a figure plunge off the roof
he runs over
looks down at the twisted body
the inspector moans barely alive
white kneels by his side
bumsteads hand moves across to an expanding pool of red beside him traces an h on the ground in the blood
white reading aitch
the inspector seems to be dying then revives momentarily puts a map in whites hand looks up at him gesundheit
his eyes roll up and he goes limp
white stares at the body then i didnt sneeze
the mortician turns off the lights in the main hall and steps into his office sits down pours himself a hot drink turns on the radio opens his conic book
a noise o
disturbs him and he gets up walks out of his office looks into the darkness
pans around the empty morgue
decides to go back to his office
he turns and is startled by three mystery men obstructing his path
we are looking for the white victims
and who the hell are you the mortician catches a glimpse of the shiny dagger man is clutching by his side
he becomes very scared
numbers eight to twelve
three men look over to where the mortician has pointed in unison
man looks back
a flash of steel
the morticians throat spouts blood
he grabs reflexively at the gash and falls back onto the floor dead before he hits the tiles
the mystery men step to an adjoining chamber
man puts down a box he is carrying opens the lid
a green glow oozes out
the other men manipulate levers on a control panel on a nearby wall
stainless steel doors open
body length trays slide into the dim light
shapes covered in white sheets
man with the box removes a glass syringe filled with a glowing green liquid
he steps to the bodies and injects each with the syringe through the sheets
when he has finished he steps back places the syringe back in the box
the men leave silently
all is silent and still
then the shape beneath a sheet starts to sit up
then another and another
white is running again clutching bumsteads map
reveals the entire corridor
keeps pulling back until the view is impossibly wide like a cross section of the building hes in a dolls house with the roof taken off
the tiny figure runs amidst a dark network of surrounding rooms and passages
white is no more than a speck the hall way stretches endlessly in both directions behind and in front of the moving figure through an infinite labyrinth
we no longer make out the figure
the x rayed environment resembles some intricate aerial map of the vast city the corridor an ever increasing spiral
white reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs
apartment h a rusted metal letter on the door
white steps forward
he knocks once and the door creaks open unlocked
the rooms are empty derelict strewn with rubbish
mould grows on the damp walls
a door stands at the end of a long empty room
he can hear the muffled sounds of surf seagulls
white starts to walk forward smiling
as he approaches the door he begins to feel colder
he opens the door and looks out
a blast of sunlight blue ocean and sky
white does not turn about he takes a step forward then another and runs into the sky a painted wall
he glances up at a small speaker built into the wall the source of the sea side sound effects
he hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him
hopes dashed he turns
angle on a mystery man a gun pointed at whites stomach
there is nothing mister white
beyond the city
never has been
white is led into a pitch black room
tight on whites face in the darkness he looks across to the mystery man standing beside him
how did you know where to find me
we knew you would turn up here eventually
been waiting for you yes
hoped you wouldnt make a nuisance of yourself on the way
the man motions with the gun for white to walk forward
as soon as white turns to do this the man slips from the room and shuts the door cutting off any existing light
a noise o
some kind of machine being turned on lights start to come up all over the room
its a normal average sized living room
all the furniture has been removed and replaced with chairs tables podiums an arrangement resembling an improvised court of law
in fact white realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box
the apartment is devoid of people though almost immediately a door opens to the side looks like it would lead to the kitchen and a series of figures step through
all the men take up specific positions around the room without uttering a word but dont sit
one mystery man opens a curtain beneath an arched entrance beyond it within a very small room stand dozens of people crammed shoulder to shoulder
the people stare at white silently a bizarre gallery of spectators
an eerie silence falls on the room
the kitchen door opens again
white is shocked to see the victims walk into the room and adopt positions in what is obviously the area for the jury
the disemboweled corpse of a woman steps out of the shadows pushing a pram
her throat is cut she is shrouded in a white sheet
within the pram is the baby clutching its own head with spine attached under its arm
then the mutilated fredrick hops out followed by the three brown blood stained paper parcels containing what is left of the young boy
finally his wife and the japanese woman still in passionate embrace take their positions
another door opens a closet
within stands the figure we have only seen as a shadow the elderly mystery man with the cane
mister black slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain hanging from the ceiling the light snaps on inside the closet
somewhere a long way off in the same building a toilet is heard flushing
he is much older than the rest carries himself with authority as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium supporting his withered body on his cane
looks like he will play judge
everyone in the room now sits
mister black looks at white
angle on white he starts to tremble not so much from fear but cold
white just looks at him still clutching the small notebook called answers
john white you are to be tried for murder yes
you wish to confess to these crimes now
white is silent
he leans over and scratches his legs through the fabric of his trousers
they itch like crazy
mister black turns to the assembled people
the testimony of the prosecutors
two mystery men stand and step across to a wooden easel
man stands beside it reveals a series of visuals charts etc
drawn on stiff cardboard
man uses a pointer while he describes the evidence to support their case
we will show that john white is abnormal a menace to society a dangerous sick individual and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable
to the extreme for his crimes
man places a large black and white photo blow up on the easel
it shows white at the door of the japanese womans apartment clutching a kitchen knife covered in blood
exhibit a shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime yes
a photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents
white watches in stunned silence
a general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is made
mister black turns to the victims nods his head slowly
man removes a small tape recorder hands it to man
actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime yes
he turns a switch the reels spin slowly
a hush fills the room
voice sounds like japanese woman no
voice sounds like white shut up
a ripping sound
voice sounds like his wife john
white is standing up involuntarily he cant listen to this any longer
white a squeak almost inaudible stop it
this is a lie
mister black turns to white
the men testifying stop the tape and look at him also
something to say
ready to confess
the men in the audience turn and all stare at white as do the victims and the spectators in the adjoining room
white back to a whisper i didnt kill anyone
white finds his voice its lies
he grips the barrier before him
a shriek from the pram containing the baby it rocks violently from side to side
the disemboweled woman rises from her chair
she has difficulty standing her limbs stiff
she looks at white opens her mouth to say something but no sound comes out
instead a tiny red crab scuttles out across her face and falls to the ground
she sits down
white is stunned
bring the witnesses
an older couple are led out of the kitchen by a mystery man
shown to seats behind a podium
the woman looks sadly at white
you are the accuseds parents
wait a minute
you had your turn
let them speak
white angry my parents are supposed to be dead
you cant keep changing the damn rules like this
why go through this ridiculous set up
why dont you just kill me and be done with it
mister black smiles at parents please continue
this is insane
he looks over to the victims
it was them not me
points at the mystery men they killed you
looks back at the mystery men
you have invented all this
history is a lie not just mine everyones a fiction
you are the authors
his knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier
a fanciful idea mister white
everyone has a job a function
each one teaches you more about your invention
im what is called a murderer the whole court listens in silence to whites testimony
youve given everybody memories but i missed out
the doctor saw to that played your own game
white looks at the mystery men then back at mister black
youre trying to get rid of me
there is silence
why do i threaten you
youre scared arent you
mister black and the gathered mystery men look speechless at white
suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous laughter led by mister black
a terrible cackle fills the room all the mystery men laugh hysterically so do the mutilated victims
the spectators in the adjoining room remain silent
ah a plot now we have a plot
chuckling very inventive
the older couple behind the podium look disturbed
please john youre embarrassing us
mister black chuckling still you have proof
white holds up notebook its all here
mister black seems startled by the book then pretends its nothing
a book of delusions
turns to the victims the verdict yes
wait this isnt fair
the disemboweled woman stands again
this time she opens her mouth there is a bubbling noise water runs out then disemboweled woman whisper guil ty
white is agitated fear in his face
mister black stamps some papers before him repeatedly
on the papers official looking documents
the stamp says close on whites eyes
before i pronounce sentence
suddenly the papers on the bench in front of mister black burst into flames
mister black recoils almost falling off his chair taken by surprise
the mystery men all look at white a murmur of concern
mister black looks up at white angered
how dare you use your tricks on me
white genuinely surprised looks around
several mystery men back away from him scared
i didnt realise
shut up freak
you are insignificant
he glares across the room angrily
an wooden chair in a corner starts to vibrate
close on mister blacks eyes
the chair rises into the air hurls across the room at white
mister black laughs as it crashes into the wall
white ducks just in time
the gathered mystery men erupt into enthusiastic applause
white regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own
he lifts a small table into the air and makes it spin a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface as several plates from a stack in
the kitchen hurl firstly at the spinning table then go flying across the room smashing near mister black making him dance back and forth comically
this display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a waltz playing on a floating gramophone white has also activated with his mind
several mystery men are terrified
white is amazed at his own performance
youll regret that
mister black is furious spluttering spit flying from his mouth
mister black shouts a mystery man by the window picks up a phone and dials furiously
everyone in the room remains silent waiting
yes we have a problem here
shut it down immediately
white doesnt understand what is going on
the sound of machinery winding down
angle on a clock hanging on the wall
on the second hand
it suddenly stops
all eyes are on mister black
this has all gone too far
yes much too far
mister black starts to shake
his eyes shut clenches his teeth grips the insect on his cane plants his feet firmly to the floor
around the room walls crack plaster rains down from the ceiling
all over the city things start to fall apart a devastating impact on the landscape
a street cracks open
beneath the pavement are pulsating intestine like organs
these burst open with pus
a building vanishes
a car on a street corner flies into the air
a telephone box starts to spin faster and taster digging itself into the concrete
monstrous insect legs sprout from the hole left behind
geysers of steaming bile spurt into the night sky
black excrement forces up out of a sewer runs down stone steps
the city is coming apart
the room looks like an earthquake hit it broken furniture and gaping holes torn in the walls
several mystery men huddle behind an upturned table watching white and mister black
they face each other both still standing mental energies focused against each other in battle
the fighting is taken its toll on both men
a dagger hangs suspended in mid air slowly rotating to face white with its shining silver blade
mister black is clenching his rotting teeth tightening bony fists by his side
pushing every ounce of mental power at the knife
white bleeding from a gash in his cheek is straining his mind against the knife
the blade starts to move ever so slowly at first towards white
his body is shaking with his mental effort
a bead of sweat runs down his brow dripping into his eye blurring his vision
he is losing
we see an out of focus image
a group of dark figures
white regains consciousness strapped to a kitchen table
from his perspective in the immediate foreground a figure speaks as he removes a syringe from whites forehead
good as new
everything is easier now
his vision clears he can see
its mister black
behind him a small crowd who turn out to be mystery men
mister black suddenly pulls at his own face removes the mask
underneath is a mess of pulsating organs and insect parts
this is what mystery men really look like
he laughs starts to move rhythmically a strange dance step
the others join in as they too pull off masks
each man reaches up to his left ear in unison
they pull squirming insects out hold them up to the light
the insects scream triumphantly
white screams too
and he cant stop
everything goes black
then the sound of a key rattling in a lock
a door slowly creaks open
enters a small room
dappled sunlight through a tattered lace curtain
a clock ticks on a wall
a cough o
from the corridor
a fat man talks as he enters its small but clean
it isnt and the views nice
points to window isnt it
john white enters
he is haggard eyes rimmed with red
he still holds the small black notebook tight to his chest
he stands in the centre of the room looks up
strangely though the room is very small it extends upwards several stories windows sit at various heights
white walks to the lace curtain opens it with shaking hands
a narrow street and at the end the ocean
the sound of distant surf he can taste the salt spray
white without turning ill take it
the man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go shutting the door
white puts the notebook down on a table near the open window
white has fallen asleep on the bed
he wakes troubled
stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed
he moves like he is underwater
the sea breeze tugs at the curtain draws him to the window
down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings
two figures approach each other
he pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the woman places it against the pillow on the bed
he sits on the edge of the bed and lifts his trousers looks at his legs nothing out of the ordinary
white is disturbed by a tiny movement in his coat pocket
he reaches in and pulls out a small emaciated fish
disgusted he drops the fish to the floor looks at the creature
white raise his foot
his heel comes down with a sickening squish
the camera moves in steadily towards the notebook near the window
as the shot tightens we can read the title on the cover answers by jonathan white age nine
now a sudden gust of wind blows open the book
the pages flicker past
glimpses of happy things
a childs drawings of smiling people
the sun shining down on a blue ocean full of sailing boats
fields of colourful flowers
sound of surf distant muffled
camera moves slowly towards a door
the final door no others beyond this
tight on white his haggard face moves through darkness
he looks down at his walking feet
white sees water waves breaking through the cracks in the floorboards of the hallway
the cracks around the closed door are illuminated white hot by the sun outside
on his hand as he reaches towards the handle
on his face as the door opens
a sharp line of light cuts across his features as his eyes blink and water
the wind pulls at his messy hair
surf noise is louder now
reverse angle wider outside looking through the door along a long wooden pier jutting out into a blue seascape
at the end of the pier stands the tiny figure of a woman with red hair
she looks out at the ocean her back turned
angle looks back at white standing in the open doorway squints into the sun
suddenly he looks relieved almost happy for the first time
he steps out of frame briskly a weight gone from his shoulders
everything is clear finally he knows exactly what to do
a voice recites names over a p
a tracking shot follows white moves down the pier toward the woman
as white steps up to her she turns and smiles
woman indicates the sea beautiful
white nods slowly
he looks out of place in his crumpled suit
he stares out at the ocean
seagulls fly over
sun reflects off waves
whats your name
he looks at her
then slowly brings his hands to her throat
