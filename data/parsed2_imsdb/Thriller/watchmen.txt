written by david hayter alex tse close on a have a nice day happy face pin
steam rises past the pin
we hear a kettle boiling
we pull back and find that the pin adorns the lapel of a robe worn by edward blake but amazingly not far from his physical prime body chiseled built like
handsome too save the long scar running down the side of his face
blake removes the kettle from the stove
he scoops some asian tea leaves from a can dumps them in a cup
the apartment is expensive but not quite luxurious
terrific new york view from the window
blake lives well if alone
he sits on the couch with his cup of tea puts his feet up
hits the remote turns the big screen tv on
the news addressing the united nations today the president expressed his concern over the increasingly intense territorial disputes in both asia and the middle east
cut to the president of the united states the sound of a bullet at one end of the world echoes across the ocean to the other end
armed conflict is not self contained in its respective region the consequences reverberate through every nation across the world and therefore must be avoided at all costs
cut back to the anchorwoman while the presidents position was clear he did not comment on whether or not he would order dr
manhattan into action should the situation continue to escalate
cut to stock footage of dr
manhattan a man at least he appears to be who has glowing blue skin
the stock footage shows dr
manhattan flying through the air as a missile heads straight for him
with a wave of his hand dr
manhattan stops the missile in its flight frozen in mid air inches from his face
with another wave dr
manhattan detonates the missile
manhattan disappears in the explosion
but once the smoke clears we see hes still there
unscathed blake snorts at the stock footage changes the channel crash
the front door explodes splintered by a kick blake jumps up immediately at the ready when we see the intruders feet entering
blake sees the intruders face though we never do we only see that hes dressed in all black including gloves and a knit hat
a look of recognition comes over blake
just a matter of time i suppose
with sudden blinding speed blake whips the saucer from under his cup sending it flying like a saw blade
the intruder bats it out of the air with even quicker reflexes but the act buys blake time to pull a pistol with a silencer from a hollowed out stereo
hes a pro but so is our intruder
before blake can get a shot off the intruder is already upon him snatching the gun out of blakes hand blake punches the intruder in the chest plate the intruder
drops the gun
not like an old man but like the trained killer he is
but the intruder is much much faster
he smashes blake with an elbow to the head
blood blurs his vision
the intruder picks blake up off the ground
brings him to the window with the great new york view
thirty stories up
blake looks the intruder in the eye and starts laughing
i always thought i knew the punchline
but i guess the jokes on me now
the intruder seems to regard blake a moment then with incredible strength he lifts blake over his head and throws blake through the window
blake never makes a sound as he plummets to the sidewalk
close on blakes dead body
his eyes are wide open not in fear but in resignation
as blood starts to pool behind his head we move to the happy face pin blake wore now on the sidewalk by his neck
we slowly zoom in on the pin as blood drips on it when the pin is washed away
a shopkeeper has his hose out spraying off the blood from the sidewalk
blakes body is gone a chalk outline in its place
a cop comes running up to the shopkeeper
this is still a goddamn crime scene
its been over four hours i got a business to run as they argue were back following the happy face pin as the water carries it to a drain when
someone picks the pin up
were in this persons pov as he studies the pin for a moment before pocketing it
we never see his face
we move from his pov to across the street arriving at a news stand
people at the news stand stare at
the crime scene
at the cop still arguing with the shopkeeper the patrol cars the yellow tape
at the medical examiner zipping up blakes body bag
other people at the news stand ignore the scene and peruse the magazines and periodicals most of which have inflammatory headlines regarding the tense atmosphere currently in the world a
newsweek headline reads war
the new york times china moves battleships near taiwanese waters the new york post over a photo of the president with dr
manhattan what me worry
the news vendor notices a man frowning at the papers
re headlines depressing aint it
but good for business right
ironys a bitch
the man pays for a newspaper when a homeless man taps the news vendor on the shoulder
the current issue of the new frontiersman where is it
its late this month
when will it be here
i dunno pal like i said its late we move back across the street to blakes apartment building then move up the building to the broken glass window blake was
thrown out of
we move into the window inside the apartment where det
gallagher older jaded and det
fine street worn but not quite cynical yet walk through the crime scene
fine studies the broken window
edward blake years old six two
a solid guy was built like a linebacker
this is plate glass too youd have to step on the gas just to put a crack in this
had to be a two man job
you check the bedroom
drawers were open tossed through
or made to look like one
tosses fine an id found that in the bedroom
fine studies it
its blakes united nations id
it reads special advisor united states
you see this
he picks up a photo from the floor hands it to fine
shaking hands with the president
youre saying this guy was a spook
you think this might be a political murder
i think that this is way bigger than the both of us
he leaves det
fine to ponder this
outside blakes apartment building
its later now the news stand is closed businesses closed people gone
we move into someones pov
the person stares up at the broken window of blakes apartment now covered with plastic rorschachs journal october th
earlier today i came across what appeared to be a suicide
it was later learned to be a homicide
someones time was up
still in pov we see the person pull something from his pocket the happy face pin
we realize that this was the person whose pov we were in earlier
i discovered a clue
something i recognized
and suddenly unexpectedly i heard my own clock ticking
we move out of the pov and see our guy for the first time rorschach roar shock a masked vigilante who wears a trench coat fedora and a silver white
mask with oily black spots moving about creating shifting doubled patterns like a rorschach test
rorschach draws a hydraulic grappling gun from his coat and fires the hook and cable thirty stories up where it latches itself through blakes broken window
pressing retract rorschach flies up the wall to the th floor
with a grunt rorschach pulls himself past the plastic sheeting through the window and into blakes apartment
he investigates silent
he sees the same things that the cops saw
but he notices the speakers by the tv
notices one of the speaker covers is ever so slightly askew
rorschach pulls the speaker cover off and discovers that the speaker was hollow
the intruder clearly took blakes gun and put the cover back on when he left
blakes clothing hangs in military rows
rorschach runs his fingers along the wall seams
he pauses presses on the hanger bar which slides back to reveal a red button
pressing it the back wall of the closet slides open revealing a secret compartment
on the wall is an old framed photo of eight people in costumes from the s
included in this photo is a young edward blake blake wasnt a spook he was a superhero
weapons of all kinds adorn the walls in here
tear gas grenades rifles pistols if it can kill you blakes got it
but thats not what draws rorschachs attention
hanging on the back wall dead center is a more current costume
black leather armor gloves boots
hanging over it all like a vacant grinning face a black leather mask
framed nearby is the front page of the boston globe
the headline reads the comedian gets last laugh on moloch
underneath is a photo of blake dressed in the costume rorschach was staring at blake was a superhero called the comedian
in the photo blake holds a supervillian named moloch prisoner
well meet moloch later
on the same page is a smaller photo of a group of superheroes
rorschach is in the photo as is dr
manhattan as is the comedian
as are dan dreiberg adrian veidt and laurie jupiter all of whom well be meeting soon
the caption below reads the new watchmen
suddenly rorschach hears the front door open
he quickly closes the secret hatch
two uniformed cops stand in the doorway
you sure it wasnt the wind
nah i definitely heard something
i tell ya id rather do traffic duty than be posted at a crime scene all night
watch the door
cop pulls his gun going through the motions rather than being concerned
he then enters the bedroom
cop stands guard nervous from the bedroom clear
im checking the other rooms
cop relaxes a bit turns and comes face to face with rorschach standing inches away
the cops face goes slack with childish terror
he goes to yell but rorschach raises two fingers shhh the fingers jab into the cops windpipe
the cop hisses and falls silently as rorschach brushes past him like a whisper
see the comedian thought he had it all worked out
close on a framed photo of the first watchmen identical to the old one in blakes closet
holding the photo is hollis mason
he puts the photo down but we dont see his face yet
he was young and arrogant but what he lacked in experience he made up for in tenacity
as he speaks we pan across various framed memorabilia the first is a newspaper clipping dated mysterious masked man cleans up wharfs the caption underneath reads hero calls himself the
guess i was that way too when i started
ill never know what possessed me to put that mask on the first time
it started with the villains yknow people forget that
pirate outfits ghosts
gangs that thought it was funny to dress up and pull heists crap like that
pan across another framed clipping dated nite owl forms watchmen costumed heroes combining forces
were going to clean up this town
says costumed crusader
so a few cops we decide it might be funny to mask up too
take these guys on at the street level right
then the media got wind ran with it turned it into a whole different beast
pan across a gold statue of nite owl in his sixties era costume
the plaque below reads in gratitude
another clipping hero retires reveals identity in tell all book
finally we come to hollis mason aka nite owl s though his eyes sparkle with strength and his face still shows the edges of a born hero
the tv is on in the background
superheroes supervillians you know who i ran into the other day at the market
the screaming skull
we chatted for a while
turns out hes a born again
we see who hollis is speaking to dan dreiberg the second nite owl late s handsome though hes let himself go the past few years his edges have gone soft
he was in the photo of the new watchmen in blakes apartment
all the nuts that started popping up ill tell ya
who was that midget you and your partner chased down years ago
whatd he call himself
the big figure
a midget bad guy
guess it doesnt get lower than that does it
hollis laughs at his own joke dan chuckles polite
glances at his watch wow its really late
dan stands finishes his beer
hollis sees him to the door
well even though i spent my time catching real bad guys you were still a better nite owl than i ever was
thats bullshit hollis and you know it
with all this talk of war all thats going on in the world its a shame the government forced all you guys out
before dan can answer he notices a breaking news report on the tv this just in masked vigilante rorschach has assaulted a new york city police officer who was guarding
a crime scene in the early morning hours
rorschach is on the fbis ten most wanted list for violation of the keene act which banned masked heroes ten years ago
dan and hollis watch as an image of rorschach flashes on screen
well forced all of you guys out except one
dan nods then leaves
dan descends the stairs
he pulls up his collar against the cold and walks down an alley
a sign below hollis apartment reads mason auto repairs obsolete models a specialty
dan rides the subway lost in thought when a group of gang members wearing yellow and black bandanas brush past him
dans leg is out a couple inches too far
move your leg
i said move dick
dan finally realizes what hes talking about
dan meets his eyes for just a moment and draws back his leg
the gang members snicker at dan as they pass
dan walks down the empty street to his townhouse digging for his keys
then he stops suddenly alert
his front door hangs slightly open the locks been smashed
theres a light on inside
cautious dan enters the house
dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen
he hears odd metal scraping sounds
dan enters the kitchen stunned to find rorschach
rorschach sits at the table mask half up eating a cold can hello daniel
i helped myself to some beans
you dont mind
no of course not
you uh want me to heat some up for you
rorschach finishes the can of beans stands pulls his mask back down
theres a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time dan is wary
you were on the news
they say you attacked a cop
wont need hospitalization
other than that
how have you been keeping
out of prison
look at this
he tosses blakes happy face pin onto the table
dan picks it up runs his fingers over the red brown splotch
this little stain is that bean juice or human bean juice
it belonged to the comedian
nervous now dan glances out the window
dan contd lets talk downstairs
rorschach follows dan to a closet at the end of the hall
dan opens the closet revealing an old bookshelf
with some difficulty dan pulls open the hinged bookshelf with a rusty creak
steel stairs lead down into the dark
the two men descend into dans workshop the dusty remnants of a heros lab old computers and an owl costume hanging in a locker
no one has been down here for years
in the center of the space an oval vehicle the size of a subway car is covered by a dusty tarp the owl ship
how did it happen
someone threw him out a window
maybe it was a burglary
the killer might not have known who blake was
an ordinary burglar
kill the comedian
i heard he was working for the government
maybe it was a political killing
or maybe someones decided to kill off costumed heroes
you dont think thats
a little paranoid
is that what theyre saying about me now
that im paranoid
i m just saying the comedian made a lot of enemies over the years even amongst his friends if he had any
the man wasnt exactly endearing
just because something happened to him doesnt mean it involves us
one of our own has been murdered
i thought you might be interested
an attack on one is an attack on all of us right
im out rorschach
ive been out weve all been out
you know that
i know that
anyways i thought id let you know
just in case
you can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on fleet street rorschach turns to walk off down a long dark tunnel
used to come here a lot
back when we were partners
those were good times rorschach
more to himself what ever happened to them
rorschach disappears into the subway tunnel leaving dan to reminisce alone
dan glances at his old costume hanging
the kind of room you rent by the hour
or the minute even
a cheap looking hooker enters with an army officer giggling
she playfully pushes the officer onto the bed
so tell me what you wanna do
seeing that i dont have to be back to base till friday everything
he puts a stack of bills on the dresser
then takes his uniform off like he cant wait
the hooker gets on top of him when the door flies off the hinges
rorschach steps in yanks the hooker off the officer gets to his feet throws a punch which rorschach dodges
rorschach grabs the guys arm then kicks the officer on the side of his knee tearing the joint to shreds
the officer cries out in pain falls to the floor rorschach nails him in the head with a black jack knocking him out
the hooker screams
rorschach grabs her by the hair and slams her face into the wall
nose broken and bleeding the hooker quiets to a whimper
rorschach takes the officers uniform and id
a mammoth shining skyscraper
at the th floor there is a huge v shaped hole where water falls
a mammoth lobby
the decor is egyptian and marble
dan approaches a beautiful assistant behind an imposing desk
im here to see adrian veidt
do you have an appointment
no uh just tell him dan dreiberg is here to see him
im sorry mr
veidt doesnt see anyone without an appointment
i understand but if you would just tell adrian that dan dreiberg is here im an old friend
veidt is very busy at the just tell him im here
i assure you hell see me
dan glares at her
she glares right back
a game of chicken
she reluctantly gets up goes inside the office
once shes gone dans glare disappears replaced by nervousness
because hes not sure if adrian will see him its been a long time
he glances at the security guards eyeing him
finally the assistant returns
go on in mr
dan enters the enormous office there are three tv feeds projected onto the walls architectural models of real estate developments poster size ad campaigns for nostalgia perfume all reflecting the
financial empire of veidt enterprises owned by adrian veidt late s movie star looks is at the far end of the office sprinting on a treadmill as journalist doug roth holds a tape recorder to him
adrian sees dan approaching smiles wide
he holds up a finger telling dan to hold on a sec
dan nods takes a seat on the couch
picks up a fortune magazine with adrian on the cover
veidt would you acknowledge that you are considered the worlds smartest man
i think its better to be the worlds most modest man
you should ignore my pr people they tend to be a little too enthusiastic
though adrian seems to be sprinting at top speed he hardly seems out of breath as he answers questions
if we could move off the subject of business for a moment im curious whether the worlds smartest man thinks were headed for our next world war
adrian stops the treadmill towels off as he heads to dan
predicting stock prices isnt the same as predicting world events
i hope there isnt a war or even a skirmish for that matter
because veidt enterprises has some exciting plans plans that will pardon the cliche truly make this world a better place
my team of engineers and scientists have been working with dr
manhattan himself on synthesizing a new cheap form of energy which will eliminate the worlds reliance on fossil fuels with no toxic emissions
this energy could power cars aircrafts stadiums there are no limitations reaching dan
but i talk too much
will you mind pausing the interview a moment doug
a good friend of mine is here
doug roth leaves
adrian hugs dan despite the sweat
you look good adrian
dan its been far too long
dan and adrian sit talking over coffee
dan examines an action figure of adrian as ozymandias his superhero alias
he paid me a visit too
mustve been tough to get past your security even for him
i thought your assistant was going to take me out
sara can be tough
is that why you came to see me
youre worried about this mask killer theory rorschachs conjured up
youre the worlds smartest man adrian
you tell me
rorschachs a sociopath suffering through nostalgia
i revealed my identity to the public as soon as the keene act was passed
if an old enemy wanted me dead it would have been done already
adrian notices the news on one of his tv projectors
something about pakistan putting troops along the indian border
adrian turns up the volume looking grim
no there are other things in the world im far more concerned about
on the wall the tv projector shows an image of two pakistani soldiers on patrol
were now actually with the two soldiers on patrol
one of the soldiers takes out a pair of binoculars looking into the mountains
they speak in baluchi we should attack the indian bastards
i dont understand cut to pov a sniper scope locked in on the pakistani soldier
why i cant just pull this trigger
we see two indian soldiers hidden in the mountains one with his sniper rifle aimed
they speak in hindi because then a battle begins
then a war
and then the americans will send in mandarin their blue abomination to intervene
and we dont want that
at the same time we cant assume to know whats on the minds of our enemies
were in chinese waters off the coast of taiwan
the chinese captain and his first mate look out at the water
taiwanese gunboats can be seen in the distance
were in the control room as an israeli officer and his much younger aide watch satellite images on the giant screen
images of potential targets
they speak in hebrew is dr
manhattan even real
why dont you ask the vietnamese
or the iraqis
manhattan is real
thank god for that
a sign posted on a razor wire fence reads rockefeller military research center
an m toting guard stands at the gate
we move into rorschachs pov as he approaches the gate
the guard has no reaction to rorschach because rorschach is in disguise wearing the army officers uniform he stole
rorschach presents his id
the guard waves him through
rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask on
he quietly enters a huge room which contains technologically advanced military devices
distorted in sections of glass we see the reflection of a huge man glowing bright blue good evening rorschach
and we see dr
manhattan formerly jon osterman for the very first time
he is sixty feet tall blue light ripples from his skin emanating pure power he is god on earth
he works on a reactor telekinetically moving parts in the air not even looking at rorschach
its as if dr
manhattan already knew he was coming
manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend laurie jupiter very much in her prime enters from the other end
jon did you say some rorschach what are you doing here
youre a wanted man
nice to see you too silk spectre
dont call me that
my mother made me take that name
i always hated it
sorry miss jupiter
i thought i should tell you the bad news the comedian has been murdered
yes since he and i are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed by the government i was informed
the cia suspects one of the radical islamic groups
manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size
he speaks in a cold even matter of fact manner
i have my own theories
but neither of you seem too concerned
a live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles
structurally theres no difference
well i might not be able to count molecules but either way blake was a bastard
you know he tried to rape my mother
sounds like you may have had a score to settle
you or your mother
are you accusing rorschach please dont upset laurie
i he pauses as if he hears something
excuse me for a moment
suddenly he disappears
a group of suspicious looking middle eastern men watch as a container is being loaded onto a truck
when suddenly dr
manhattan materializes in a blue flash floating in mid air
the middle eastern men shield their eyes from the light then realize in awe and fear in arabic its him hes hes real
allah help us hes real
the men run for it but its useless dr
manhattan shoots beams of energy at them freezing all the men in mid motion when port security pulls up
they get out of their jeeps in awe of dr
manhattan still floating in mid air
these men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium with a gesture the container floats off the truck and separates into pieces
revealing the uranium inside
suddenly the uranium changes ive safely transformed the uranium into sand
i trust you can take things from here
and just like that he disappears and is back in the lab without missing a beat
im not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country
you call rape a moral discrepancy
rorschach youre upsetting laurie
i think you ought to go
i came here to warn you both just like i warned adrian and dan
i believe someone may be targeting masked heroes i said you ought to go
it took a lot of effort to get in here
im not leaving before ive with a look dr
manhattan makes rorschach disappear
rorschach materializes down the road from the base
had my say rorschach realizes what just happened
checks himself his surroundings
with nothing else he can do he heads down the road
manhattan resumes his work
he looks distracted
are you okay now
manhattan are you okay jon
manhattan pauses for a moment thoughtful
im having trouble with my vision
i cant see clearly what lies ahead
theres some static interference
caused by what
a power surge of great magnitude
perhaps a nuclear detonation
more war talk
i cant deal with this
i dont want to think about the future right now
theres no such thing as the future
ive explained to you on many occasions
that time is simultaneous
theres no past to travel back to no future to travel forward to everything happens all at once our actions affect the course of time instantly yes i know
im sorry its just a little unnerving to be with someone who can see the future or whatever you call it
i understand your frustration laurie
the human mind for some reason is only capable of viewing time frame by frame
perhaps youd find it more comforting if you could perceive time as i do dr
manhattan touches her head lauries childhood home
were in lauries pov as a little girl
theres arguing downstairs
laurie goes down to investigate
she comes upon the kitchen door ajar
she can see her parents inside arguing jon stop
back in the present laurie pulls away from dr
that memory seems to be painful for her
i didnt mean to upset you
i think ive been cooped up on this base for too long
rorschach mentioned dan dreiberg we havent seen him in years
maybe we can give him a call see if hes available for dinner tonight
you go ahead laurie
i want to further investigate this interference with my vision
i find it troubling
laurie dressed up and looking gorgeous heads out when shes stopped by a secret service agent forbes
going somewhere miss jupiter
ill have a car brought around in a few minutes
no thank you
i called a cab already its waiting for me outside
she tries to walk past but agent forbes steps in front of her
you look quite nice
who are you meeting
an old friend of mine
and of dr
now step out of my way
please keep in mind ms
jupiter that your boyfriend is this countrys most valuable asset
you need to keep him happy
and on our side
laurie glares at him
she brushes past him as she leaves
we move down the beautifully lit new york city skyline passing the brooklyn bridge
the statue of liberty and the in towers of the world trade center
we hear the laughter
of dan and laurie as they finish up their meal at this trendy restaurant
you remember that crazy guy what did he call himself
pretended to be a supervillian just so he could get beat up all the time
yeah he tried that with me once
i just walked away but he starts following me down the street in broad daylight yelling punish me
whatever happened to him
uh well he pulled that on rorschach and rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft
they look at each other serious then explode in laughter
sorry sorry thats not funny
i cant remember the last time i laughed like this
it feels good
dan looks at her as she finishes her coffee
we can see hes smitten with her and that he probably has been for years
laurie seems oblivious
its great seeing you again laurie
yeah this was fun
the waiter arrives with the check laurie grabs it
you sure i cant get that
let me put my expense account to use
you can thank uncle sam
laurie nods out the window
dan turns and sees a government sedan parked outside
theyve been watching the whole time
just making sure im not doing anything that might upset the countrys most powerful weapon
how is jon by the way
i really dont know
its been harder and harder to tell over the years
its like his emotions are slowly eroding
to be honest i cant tell if he even cares about me anymore
theyre quiet a moment
laurie glances at her watch
i should get back
dan and laurie step outside
y know when i think back why did we do it
why did we dress up like that
i think the keene act was the best thing to ever happen to us
youre probably right
i mean you remember my costume
all that tight spandex
that was awful
and to think my own mother pushed me into that spandex
pushed me into the whole costume thing in the first place
wanted her little girl to be just like mommy and fight bad guys
well i guess my ride is here
she gives dan a hug
well do this again
id really like that
laurie crosses the street and gets into the sedan
as dan watches the car drive off two kids nearly bump into him running around playing
the kids make flying noises
manhattan saving the twin towers
no i wanna be dr
you can take turns okay
dan watches the kids for a moment then walks away
the twin towers looming behind him
a few mourners gather in the rain for edward blake aka the comedians funeral
mostly government types
dan adrian and dr
manhattan line the edge of an open grave
laurie materializes in the hallway of her mothers condo in california
she immediately runs to the bathroom
bright california sunshine gleams over this upscale condo facility
lauries mother sally s but looks in her s reclines by the pool
she hears someone vomiting in her condo
is that you
sally steps through the sliding glass doors as we hear the toilet flushing
laurie wobbles out of the bathroom
id figure youd be used to traveling that way by now
well im not
i hate it when jon teleports me
sally pours herself a margarita from a pitcher on the counter
we see photos remnants of sally from her crimefighting days around the condo
under the pitcher of margaritas is a days old la times with the headline dr
manhattan intercepts terrorists at port
its eddie blakes funeral today isnt it
from here on intercut between blakes funeral and sallys condo funeral blakes coffin is removed from the hearse
finally got his punchline i guess
how can you say that
after what he laurie youre still young
you dont understand how things change as time goes by
funeral blakes coffin is carried past adrian dan and dr
another lesson on time passing
yknow you and jon should get together and write a book on the subject
sally reaches into a drawer and pulls out the old photo of the watchmen the same one with blake and hollis mason in it
that leaves just two of the old team left
me and hollis mason
she stops at blake in the photo regarding him
eddie was the comedian
he always thought hed get the last laugh
as the priest speaks we move down the row of mourners stopping at dr
manhattan looking thoughtfully into blakes match cut to dr
in the night sky a burst of fireworks
outside a crowd of vietnamese people cheer
a young blake sits in a derelict saigon bar mean drunk
his face is devoid of his trademark scar
youd think this countryd had enough goddamn fireworks
if wedve lost this war i think it might have driven us crazy yknow
as a country
but we didnt
thanks to you
you sound bitter
i think its hilarious
they both turn
a pretty vietnamese girl stands in the door
shes pregnant just starting to show
just what i need
the war is over now
we must talk
touching her abdomen about this
blake slams his glass down
he glares at her drunk and dangerous
theres nothing to talk about cuz im leaving
im gonna forget you and your horrible sweaty little country
he turns away
her eyes blaze with betrayal and hatred
you will remember
you will remember me and my country forever
she smashes a bottle
blake turns just as the broken shards slash his face slicing him his jagged scar you bitch
he pushes her into the bar and draws his pistol blake
blake shoots her the girl slams against the far wall
she drops dead
she was pregnant
you gunned her down
blake turns on him spitting fury
and you know what
you watched me
you couldve changed the gun into steam or the bullets into mercury or the bottle into snowflakes but you didnt did you
youre drifting outta touch doc ive seen it
dont tell me the war got to you
blake walks off shouting medic
manhattan turns to the girls body and regards it curious
match cut to dr
manhattan looking down at blakes grave
we move down to
this is all bullshit
dan fit and trim in full nite owl regalia attends the meeting of the new watchmen
rorschach is there as is a teenage laurie dressed in her tight spandex costume
manhattan his age unchanged stands with his girlfriend janey slater though he casts occasional glances at young laurie
who definitely glances back
dan also pays laurie attention but she is oblivious
a younger adrian dressed as oxymandias leads the meeting
what are you saying comedian
blake now in his forties smokes a cigar feet on the table a flask in hand
the paper in his hand reads arab leaders call dr
manhattan americas weapon of satan
what im saying is this whole bringing back the watchmen thing is bullshit
it didnt work twenty years ago and it aint gonna work just because you want to keep on playing cowboys and indians
maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings
look rorschach and i have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts
rorschachs voice is quiet not yet its tortured rasp
but something like this seems too big
bureaucracies can be effective with the right leadership and that would be you right veidt
i mean youre the smartest guy in the world right
it doesnt take a genius to see that the world has problems
but it takes a roomful of morons to think theyre small enough for you guys to handle
you people are a joke
you hear molochs back in town and get your panties in a bunch
you think that matters
of course it does
theres no such thing as justice
he stands moving to adrians display which outlines the watchmens agenda gangs racketeering drugs
blake flicks his zippo and the display goes up in flames
justice doesnt matter alright
because twenty years from now were all gonna be dust
mankinds been trying to kill each other off since the beginning of time and now we finally got the power to finish the job
aint nothin gonna matter when the nukes start flying and i promise you they will
then ozymandias here is gonna be the smartest man on the cinder
he sneers and walks out
uncomfortable in the wake of truth the others pack up to go muttering apologies to adrian but adrian ignores them staring at the flames flickering across his face
he seems more thoughtful than upset
match cut to adrian moving down to dan as we fade to a newspaper box
the headlines cops say let them do it senator keene proposes emergency bill banning vigilantism
pan up to reveal the streets jammed with angry protestors waving signs decrying vigilantes
angle on an oval airship the owl ship its forward windows sculpted like the eyes of a great owl
dan in costume pilots the ship
the comedian stands outside the ship in one of the owl eyes wielding a machine gun
over loudspeakers crawl back in yer holes before you get hurt
i got rubber bullets
we want regular cops
no more vigilantes
my son is a cop asshole
the comedian gets hit in the head by a flying soda can
okay thats how you wanna do it
smiling grimly he fires tear gas cannisters into the crowd
over speakers the comedian dives into the crowd knocking random people aside with his rifle butt then starts firing rubber bullets into the crowd
the protestors scatter and retreat
dan lands the owl ship exits wearing a gas mask hands one to blake
comedian this is a nightmare
the whole city is erupting
you seen this
the smoke clears enough for dan to see a message spray painted on a brick wall who watches the watchmen
how long can we keep this up
my government contacts tell me theyre pushing some new bill through congress
until then were societys only protection
protection from what
blake laughs exultant in the blowing smoke the chaos
are you kidding
close on the happy face pin on blakes costume
match cut to dan fingering blakes happy face pin
lord have mercy upon us
dan drops the pin into blakes grave
the mourners linger a moment as dirt is shoveled onto blakes casket then start filing out
we follow one particular mourner all the way in the back a lone man as he walks away
the lone man leaves quickly
the lone man removes his hat and coat
he is old withered
he is edgar jacobi
in his younger days he was a supervillain known as moloch we recognize him from the news clipping in blakes closet
moloch goes to the refrigerator opens it
then stops staring
there is a scrawled note inside
moloch picks it up in spiky handwriting it reads look behind you
over molochs shoulder rorschachs hat brim tilts up
as moloch turns rorschach lunges pins molochs arm behind his back and slams him to the floor
edgar william jacobi
also known as edgar william vaughn
also known as william edgar bright
also known as moloch
what are you talking about
im a retired business maaaaahhh
rorschach twists the mans arm back viciously
lie again ill break your arm
oh god please
i did my time
im not moloch anymore
what do you want from me
rorschach lets him go
molochs hollow eyes follow him
you attended a funeral today
i dont know why i went
i just felt i should
id been thinking about the comedian rorschach slams moloch against the wall
how did you know blake was the comedian
he broke in here
a week ago
he he had his mask off
he was drunk you were enemies for forty years
why would he visit you
i dont know
i woke up in my bedroom and there he was
he was upset
he he was babbling not making sense
i was pissing in my pants i thought he was going to kill me
what did he say
he said he was wrong
about it all being a joke that it wasnt funny anymore
he said he was scared
scared of what
something he saw i think
he said something about wishing he never broke into that building
but that he had to keep his mouth shut
then then he left
rorschach studies moloch a moment then releases him
rorschach glances around the kitchen
he opens some drawers looking inside
he picks up a stack of mail flips through it
one of the envelopes contains a pension check from pyramid industries
so thats it
i searched your house
found illegal drugs
illegal i dont use drugs
rorschach pulls a pill bottle from his coat
phony medication made from apricot pits
oh c come on
look please dont confiscate that
im trying anything i have cancer
what kind of cancer
the kind you dont get better from
youre off the hook for now
if you remember anything else leave me a note in the trash can opposite the gunga diner at fortieth and seventh
keep out of trouble moloch
close on rorschach blasting through the night air as the city streams by
this close he appears to be flying
rorschachs journal october th
thought about molochs story on my way to the cemetery
could all be lies
a scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars
cut wide to reveal he is actually perched atop an elevated subway car
just one way he gets around
but if its true then what
what could have possibly scared the comedian
what building was he talking about
what was it that he saw
so many questions
rorschach stands alone over blakes fresh grave
paying his proper respects
edward blake the comedian
born buried in the rain
flash to blake the night of his murder turning as his door is kicked in
violent lives ending violently
flash to adrians display burning
humans are violent in nature
no matter how much you try to dress it up to disguise it
flashes of the group photo of the old watchmen
then the photo of the new watchmen
blake saw the true face of human kind and chose to become a parody of it treated it like a joke
flashes of blake being beaten in his apartment
i heard a joke once
man goes to a doctor says hes depressed
life seems harsh and cruel
blake is kicked in the stomach
says he feels all alone in a threatening world
blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke
doctor says the treatment is simple
the great clown pagliacci is in town tonight
go and see him
that should pick you up
blake is lifted up by the intruders hands
the man bursts into tears
a bloodied blake laughs at the intruder
but doctor he says
ultra slow blake crashes through his apartment window
i am pagliacci
blake flies toward frame on his silent trip to the ground
blake falls into frame go black
close on laurie eyes closed with pleasure as dr
manhattans glowing blue hands caress her face
what time do you have to be at your tv interview
dont worry we have plenty of time
eyes still closed she does not see a third blue hand trace a line down her cheek
she kisses it
hey your finger its like licking a battery
its all she opens her eyes
they widen in shock and horror as she sees two dr
manhattans in bed with her
laurie jumps up
the two dr
manhattans stand confused
please dont be upset
i thought youd enjoy it
im sorry i you startled me thats all i dont know what stimulates you anymore
laurie backs into the hall trying to get a grip
forget about it
it was just strange to see laurie can now see into the kitchen where yet a third dr
manhattan is working on an experiment
her eyes blaze
how long have you been working in here
laurie try to understand understand
youre working in here at the same time were in bed
my work with adrian is at an important stage
it seemed unnecessary to shut up
just shut your mouth
laurie whips a full beaker at s chest
it passes through him and smashes in the kitchen sink
laurie storms out
laurie please if you think theres a problem with my attitude im prepared to discuss it as he speaks the smashed beaker and its contents rise into the air reassembling
perfectly in the palm of s hand
in the hall laurie nearly bumps into dr
but logically not clouded with human emotion
you were human once
thats the problem jon
youve forgotten that
laurie where are you the door slams
manhattan stands there
he walks back to the bedroom where is
manhattan holds an old photo
in the photo is a couple smiling into the camera
we recognize the woman as janey slater dr
manhattans ex girlfriend who we saw in adrians flashback at blakes funeral
we recognize the man in the photo as
when he was human
manhattan stares at the photo
perhaps feeling the tingle of human emotion again dan heats up some leftover chinese food in the microwave as the tv plays in the b g no ones fired their
weapons yet but no ones lowered them either
maybe these other countries arent so afraid of dr
manhattan maybe theyre calling the presidents bluff
im very curious to see what dr
manhattan himself has to say in his live interview which should be in about an hour or so boom boom
dan looks up
someones banging on the door
dan approaches the door cautious mask killer on his mind
who is it
it takes a few moments for him to open the door
sorry i had a new lock installed its a little sticky i left jon
dan pours a teary eyed laurie a glass of red wine
did uh the secret service follow you here
i lost them in the subways
im really sorry laurie
living with him
dan you dont know what its been like
intercut to dr
manhattan holding lauries bra
the way he looks at things like he cant remember what they are like he doesnt really care
this world the real world to him its like walking through mist and all the people are just shadows
shadows in the fog
manhattan lowers his head
a shadow falls over him
he looks up to see a three piece suit floating before him waiting for its wearer
dan and laurie walk the streets getting some air
i hope i didnt ruin your night
not at all
i was just going to see hollis for our weekly beer session
youre more than welcome to join
in fact i insist they pass the news stand from the opening scene
the homeless man is arguing with the news vendor i told you this months issue still hasnt arrived yet
why do you care about that right wing rag so much
cuz those bastards dont give a damn about you pal
they hold up here it comes
they turn as seymour a fat slob of a man arrives with a bundle of the latest issue of the new frontiersman
cut to dr
manhattan stepping through and into the empty floating suit
his tie knots itself
manhattan looks around the empty room
again he looks at the photo of him and janey slater
then dan and laurie turn down a darker less populated street
laurie will you please stop apologizing
im here for you anytime
shadows trail behind them ominous
i just find it rude when people show up at your door the main waiting area
people go about their jobs
the receptionist hears a strange electric crackling
completely out of the blue
manhattan appears in a burst of energy
the receptionist shrieks
the producer looks out his office
manhattan arrives and no one thinks to tell me
he he just all geez
we dont have time for make up
that blue is too light for television
the light from dr
manhattans skin darkens to a deeper blue
is this dark enough
uh yeah dan and laurie turn down an alley
we now see whos following them a group of young thugs
thats dark enough
a white house press agent escorts dr
manhattan to the set
just another reminder that if the second geneva convention comes up our official position is that talks will not resume until the chinese agree to exclude you from the agenda
the president approved this interview because he wanted to strengthen morale at home and to gently remind the rest of the world who holds the cards
please keep that in mind
manhattan stands off stage waiting
the lights come up and were live with the glossy news host
hes been called many things hero weapon linchpin of our security cut to dan and laurie turning as the young thugs block the alleyway
one of the thugs pulls a knife
laurie and dan exchange a look
dan removes his glasses
cut back to his given name is jonathan osterman dr
jonathan osterman a renowned nuclear physicist who through a terrible accident became the man the world knows today as dr
the audience applauds loudly as dr
manhattan takes his seat
thank you dr
manhattan and not simply for appearing on this program
i believe i speak for all of america when i thank you for thwarting the terrorist plot at the port of long beach over a week ago furious applause from
the audience which dr
manhattan regards curiously
it was my duty
cut to dan and laurie surrounded by the thugs
when suddenly they dive into the group fighting like the heroes they once were
dan grapples with one of the thugs and knocks his knife away when another thug nails him from behind with a bat
dan drops to the ground
back to before we start i want to explain to our viewers the unconventional format for this interview
our live audience is made up entirely of news media and dr
manhattan will be taking questions from the floor
this commercial free broadcast is presented to you by veidt enterprises
we see adrian standing near the audience with the press agent smiling for the camera
cut to laurie driving a fist into a thugs nose when another thug grabs her hair
we will now take our first question the thug draws a pistol on her
dan still on the ground sees the gun and his eyes narrow harden
he pushes himself up off the ground
cut back to the tv studio audience where doug roth the journalist who interviewed adrian earlier stands
manhattan doug roth nova times
do you remember a man named wally weaver
yes he was a good friend of mine
when we were both physicists
he died of cancer
i attended his funeral
how about edgar jacobi also known as the supervillian moloch
you had a lot of battles with him didnt you
did you know that he has cancer as well
the news host looks confused
adrian turns to the press agent growing concerned with where this is leading
cut to dan snapping the gunmans wrist back and up barrel aimed at the thugs chin
in the last fraction of a second dan shifts the gun two inches left as it fires deafening the thug but leaving him alive
back to i was not aware and what about jose flores
he was the longtime janitor at the watchmen headquarters where you worked for many years
by your line of questioning youre suggesting that i was the cause of cancer in these individuals
you tell me doc
adrian turns to him
doug that s enough
it is irrelevant whether i was the cause or not
a live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles
structurally theres no difference
an appalled then angry buzz comes over the audience
what about janey slater
do you think it makes a difference to her
wh your ex girlfriend she was a physicist too
you were with her for ten years
or does she have to remind you herself
suddenly janey slater emerges from a door at the top of the stands
she is old now frail barely recognizable from the images weve see of her
she has cancer as well
doctors have given her six months
what do you have to say ms
he sticks the microphone in her face
d damn you jon
god damn you
she leaves as fast as she came bursting into tears
manhattan stands visibly shaken no janey wait
in the audience adrian turns to the press agent frantic
we need to stop this now
adrian and the press agent hurry on stage security following
back to the alley littered with the unconscious bodies of the thugs
laurie and dan lean back on the wall gasping for air horribly out of shape but victorious
cut to the tv studio as adrian and security surround dr
manhattan trying to escort him out
the audience spills out of the stands rushing dr
manhattan with questions and flashing cameras its madness
adrian shoves a camera out of dr
as the sponsor of this program i demand all cameras off
his plea is futile of course
a reporter breaks through gets in dr
did you give ms
slater cancer by sleeping with her
please let me through do you even care about human life
if everyone would just go away and leave me alone
adrian hears the note of warning in his voice
everyone back off
dont you understand
hes the only thing preventing the world from chaos
how many other people did you do this to
manhattan finally snaps i said leave me alone
every last person bursts into particles and disappears
manhattan is suddenly alone
he looks stunned almost
the tv audience materializes out on the roof dan and laurie exit the quiet alley trying to play it off
i should find a hotel
imagine us getting mugged
why dont you come by hollis with me
shake off the adrenaline
no thanks ive had enough hero stuff for one night
walking away you take care dan
its a dangerous world out there
hollis opens the door for dan youre late
i know you wont believe it you missed it dr
manhattan just lost it on live tv
dan turns to the tv which replays the clip of dr
manhattan being accosted and then teleporting everyone to the roof
i was just with laurie
she doesnt know
shell know soon enough
the whole world will know
laurie rides in back staring out at the street calming down
the cab stops at a red light the cabbie takes outa zippo lights a cigarette
laurie stares at the flame like she stares at the flame here as adrians display burns
laurie glances around as everyone leaves apologizing to adrian
outside watchmen hq dans owl ship rises out of view
rorschach skulks off into the shadows
manhattan and janey slater get into a town car as young laurie watches from around the corner
startled laurie turns
blake steps out of the shadows
youre sally jupiters kid
youre the comedian right
you were pretty cool in there
blake lights a smoke looks her over
you got your moms eyes
even that funny little mole
got another smoke
she was one of the all time champion beauties your mom
she talk about me much
as blake gives her a light laurie touches his hand to cover the lighter from the wind
she looks up at him sly
laurie nearly jumps out of her skin
a younger sally marches toward them from a limo waiting at the sidewalk
long time no see
not long enough in my book eddie
she eyes laurie with cool death
put that out
get in the car
inside the limo laurie cracks her window an inch
her mothers harsh low tone drifts clearly back
are there no depths you wont sink to
christ we were just talking
cant a guy talk to his yknow friends daughter
what the hell do you think i am
i know what you are eddie
ive always known
dont ever forget that
driving off laurie watches blake through the window like she watches through the window in the present
the light turns green when a black suv pulls in front of the cab blocking its path
the cabbie honks his horn as a team of secret service agents get out of the suv
agent forbes knocks on lauries window
jupiter you need to come with us now
agent forbes escorts her into the room
i dont understand what do you mean jons gone
i mean he snapped and disappeared during the interview
now our trackers cant detect him anywhere on the planet
if we want to find him youre our only hope
a technician wires laurie up graphs record lauries neural responses monitors show satellite images
miss jupiter we need you to visualize dr
do you need a prompt
transmitting on all frequencies
were ready miss jupiter
we need you to try and talk to him
laurie wired like a porcupine seems embarrassed
jon can you hear me
the graph needles jump and tick searching when a high clear tone rings through the room
technicians dash to lock it down
agent forbes hurries to the graph looking over their shoulders
have you got him
weve located his signal yes
where the hell is he
the technician looks up not happy about the answer
hes on mars
huge dishes scan the skies
we hear the high clear tone above all the radio chatter news reports and military frequencies the endless echoing chaff of the world
massive mobilization of troops in unconfirmed reports of a gunfire exchange in tehran prompting the president to call an emergency meeting with his national security advisors jon
can you hear me jon
but these voices get progressively quieter as we zoom back up out of the atmosphere at a blinding rate landing on a vast martian plain and the tiny blue figure
walking across it red dust billowing behind him
the peace and quiet after the cacophony of earth is soothing
manhattan stops looking over the landscape
he holds the photo of him and janey slater in his hand when he was human
he stares at the photo a moment and closes his eyes and we flashback to the moment that photo was taken
he and janey are at a carnival
after the flash janey turns to him
aww jon look youve got cotton candy on the side of your mouth
you do too
here let me get it for you
he pulls her close
they giggle like the young lovers they are and then kiss passionate back to dr
manhattan walking on mars surface
he approaches a large rock formation which blocks his path
he parts the rock formation telekinetically like moses parting the sea and we flashback mirroring the parting of the rock formation to the parting of two sliding doors in the
lab of a nuclear testing facility as jon steps into the reactor ill catch up with you guys i left my watch inside
jon backs into the chamber without noticing the digital clock above the doors counting down time lock initiated the doors close
back to dr
manhattan on mars as he stops to pick up a strange rock
its beautiful the colors the crystals unlike anything weve ever seen and we flashback to jons lab colleagues watching in horror as jon retrieves his watch oblivious
they try to open the door but its no use the time lock cant be overridden
janey arrives screams when she sees jon inside
jon turns sees all the terrified faces staring at him
the time lock jon
as it dawns on jon he hears the hum of the reactor initiating the big mechanical parts moving
jon runs to the door bangs on it
janey oh my god
tears stream down janeys face as she looks at him through the thick glass helpless hopeless
inside the chamber starts to glow
im sorry jon i cant janey cant bear to watch she runs out of the lab as the reactor initiates and with a blinding flash jon and his watch are
obliterated to bits
back to dr
manhattan on mars as he obliterates the strange rock he was holding to bits and we flashback to the lab cafeteria
janey sits at a table crying softly being consoled by her colleagues cut to outside the nuclear facility by the barbed wire fences a disembodied brain a set of eyes
and a spinal back to dr
manhattan on mars as he rises into the air
at a thought the red sand fuses into a beautiful pink glass and we flashback to the cafeteria kitchen as a cook shrieks at a walking network of human veins
back to the pink glass structure on mars which spreads out into complex glass patterns rising from the plain at dr
manhattans command and we flashback to the cafeteria hallway as a skeleton passes two terrified guards back to dr
manhattan now dwarfed by the rising evolving glass structure which begins to resemble parts of a watch and we flashback to the cafeteria
janeys still crying
one of her colleagues reaches for her hand when static sparks snap around them
all over the cafeteria the metal utensils begin to spark
in the center of the room glowing blue particles begin to collect slamming into each other with amazing force and in a blinding flash the particles form dr
manhattan hovering over the room like a newborn god
everyone in the cafeteria looks up in awe in fear and oh god
jon is that you
back to mars where dr
manhattans glass palace rises in its full glory
a home fit for a god
pull out from a satellite image of mars
noise filters back in as technicians buzz this way and that desperate
there must be some way to contact him
laurie sits in the room largely forgotten
distracted annoyed what
i need to go to the bathroom
agent forbes gives her a look then waves for a secret service agent to escort her
laurie heads to the bathroom trailed by the secret service agent
as she reaches the bathroom door she suddenly spins and elbows the agent in the groin
the agent buckles laurie grabs him by his coat shoves his head through the bathroom door and slams the door on his head
laurie drags the groggy agent into the bathroom
she takes his gun pulls it on him
youre getting me out of here
were only detaining you for national security purposes
dont you understand
dont you understand that sitting there with a bunch of high tech radios and monitors isnt going to bring him back
only one thing can bring ion back and thats jon
if he wants to find me hes quite capable of doing so on his own
ive been a prisoner in my live long enough
you are taking me out of here because if you dont and jon does come back im going to let him know who was naughty and who was nice
and he wont give you a lump of coal hell turn you into one understand
the agent eyes her then reluctantly gets to his feet
dan sleeps peacefully in his bed when a shadow moves over dan dropping a newspaper on his lap waking dan with a gasp
rorschach hovers beside the bed
rorschach good morning daniel
i brought in your paper
dan reads the headline dr
manhattan leaves earth
the comedian murdered
two of us gone within a week
rorschach turns for the door as dan reads the story
by the way that new lock broke after one shove
my new lock
get a stronger one daniel
you cant be too security conscious these days
these days nobodys safe
we see the same pakistani soldiers from before only now there are dozens more troops with them mobilizing on the border as are their indian counterparts
cut to the chinese battleships we saw before moving towards the coast of taiwan
they fire shots cut to the israel missile control room we were in before now bustles with frantic action
three synagogues were bombed in tel aviv a bus exploded in jerusalem enough
begin the first wave of air strikes
a huge map of the world is projected onto the war room screens
the president and his advisors look up at it
the chinese have already made their move
india and pakistan have engaged and everyone in the middle east is going at israel
time to start picking sides mr
forget picking sides first are we safe
weve increased security at all entry points water ports airports and border patrol
i want the national guard put on the border
as for the rest of it
lets not jump into the fray just yet
president i urge you to lets just wait okay
maybe hell come back
beat wishful maybe hell come back
adrian steps off the elevator when hes met by his assistant
clocks ticking mr
im meeting the toy people yes
they want to talk to you about some new villains for the ozymandias line
all the old villains are dead
whats with everybody today
everyones on this death trip
i suppose the threat of war has that effect
across the way dan enters the building intercepts adrian
adrian i need to talk to you
adrian looks put off
dan im sorry this is a bad time
but what about what happened with ion
adrian excuses himself from his assistant
jons departure is terrible
not only for whats happening in the world now but for what could have happened
the energy project he and i were working on its dead now
rorschach came to see me again
maybe theres something to this mask killer thing
are you still preoccupied with the ramblings of that lunatic
i really dont have time for this dan
adrian walks away continuing on with his assistant when a man in a trenchcoat approaches the pair
he draws a gun on them
sometimes i cant bear to watch the news
it makes it so hard to be optimistic is that a gun
dan sees whats happening adrian
the man shoots the assistant in the gut adrian immediately springs into action he moves with unbelievable speed and quickness grabbing a velvet rope stanchion deflecting a second bullet with
it and smashing it into the face of the assassin knocking him into a fountain
security guards run guns drawn toward the fountain where adrian grapples with the dazed man
let us handle it
wait hes got a poison capsule
he jams his fingers into the assassins mouth when dan arrives
dont bite down you scum
i want to know who sent you
the assassins eyes bulge i want to know whos behind this
the assassin chokes and dies
adrian drops him unanswered
he looks over at dan frustrated
dan and laurie sit in the back of the cafe making sure they have privacy
oh my god
wheres adrian now
talking to the cops
thank god hes still in great shape
you get so caught up with the whole smartest man in the world thing you forget what a physical specimen he is hes as fast as ive ever seen him
what about you
what are you going to do
im not sure
i cant go stay with my mom im sure thats the first place theyll look
but i need to get out of the city
its only a matter of time before they find me
listen why dont you
how about you stay at my place
oh dan i couldnt impose it wouldnt be an imposition i have an extra room
and with everything thats been happening youre buying into rorschachs mask killer theory
i dont know
but it cant hurt to be safe
besides ive already had one wanted person visit me another one wont make a difference
they look at each other
so this guy who tried to kill adrian who was he
some local low life named roy chess
rorschach investigates the apartment of roy chess adrians would be assassin
the place is decent but messy
rorschach spots a porno mag on the coffee table
on the couch nearby a pair of pants
rorschach picks them up reaches into the pockets
he pulls out some cash credit cards and an id for pyramid industries
it says chess was a security guard and then rorschach remembers the pension check he saw at molochs house
from pyramid industries
rorschach sees a laptop over on the kitchen table
the computer is on and shows the server for pyramid industries
rorschach navigates the server until he finds the employee once in the directory he pauses for a second
then he types in a name jane slater
a photo of janey slater pops up status retired
rorschach stares at the screen excited at the connection
were in rorschachs pov as he walks down the street
from the non reaction of passers by he obviously doesnt have his mask on
rorschachs journal october th
someone tried to kill adrian veidt
proves mask killer theory the murderer is closing in
pyramid industries is the key
rorschach approaches a trash can
he rummages through it and finds an envelope
he opens it and finds a note that reads tonight m
checked mail drop got a message from moloch
was just going to pay him a visit
rorschach turns down an alley approaches a dumpster
he reaches behind the dumpster
my things are where i left them
still in his pov we watch him put each article on
then he pulls out his mask
rorschach pulls his mask on filling the screen close on molochs eyes staring fearfully out the rainy window
rorschach appears in the darkness behind him
somebody tried to shoot the worlds smartest man today moloch
moloch sits at the kitchen table
close on molochs hand
an ignored cigarette smolders
in his other hand a note
the hitman worked for pyramid industries
so did janey slater and everyone else dr
manhattan allegedly gave cancer to
and last time i was here i saw a pension check sent to you from the same company obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the
comedian that pushed dr
manhattan over the edge that wants us masks dead
is that why you left me a note in my mail drop
you have something to confess
a hole gapes between molochs staring eyes
a pistol lies on the table molochs dead
rorschach carefully pulls the note from molochs hand
its the note rorschach had left in molochs refrigerator the one that reads look behind you
behind rorschach blinding light glares through the window
over loudspeakers no
no no no molochs corpse stares at rorschach
rorschach tears open the cupboards pulling items off the shelves
walked right into it
stupid stupid stupid
rorschach takes an aerosol can and a pepper shaker
rorschachs mask disappears back into darkness
when you are crash
molochs door is smashed open
armed swat cops swarm in but no more than three can fit in the narrow entry way
its a bum tip im telling you
keep your eyes open
swat cop moves down the hall carelessly ahead of formation behind him rorschach appears out of the darkness
he ignites the aerosol cans stream spraying the cops with fire
they fall back screaming shooting
swat cop catches the worst of it he drops and rolls on the floor trying to extinguish the flames on him
rorschach bolts upstairs igniting the staircase behind him
whered he go
swat cops top the nd floor landing already lit by fire
where is he
into radio send the second team in
graves is down
and we need a fire unit
all this smoke stay calm the file says he never goes armed
rorschach appears blowing pepper into cop s eyes
get out of the way
i dont have room to swat cop clears his line of fire and finds rorschach the hook blows the body armored cop over the railing
gallagher and fine watch from behind a line of cop cars
the house is now blazing
smoke and mens screams drift out
weve got him
theres no way out
from the second floor rorschach smashes through the window snarling like a rabid dog landing hard on the concrete
his ankle twists dropping him to the ground
rorschach struggles to get to his feet
when he looks up he finds twenty cops in a semi circle before him
a loaded pregnant pause
the cops rush forward
but rorschach holds up a gloved hand
and they all stop unsure what this lunatic will do next
ive waited for this
he beckons them forward
the cops pile into him
rorschach brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed
must get up
find who framed me a cop kicks him in the throat
rorschach drops again
get that mask off him
i got it
christ he stinks
no no no no no no
the cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the homeless man from the news stand
he screams at them wildly
give it back to me
rorschach is finally beaten surrounded by cops as molochs house blazes in the background
dan is at the front door fixing the lock rorschach busted twice when laurie comes down the stairs yawning
what time is it
thought id let you sleep in
laurie smiles at him
is dan crazy or does he sense a spark
she touches his shoulder as she turns into the living room then turns on the tv
today police searched the apartment of walter kovacs better known as the masked vigilante rorschach
kovacs was captured last night and charged with the murder of edgar jacobi formerly known as the supervillain moloch
moloch was found shot in the head at point blank range
both dan and laurie stop what theyre doing eyes fixed on the tv they see rorschach unmasked in shackles
inside the decrepit apartment police discovered stacks of right wing literature including several years of back issues of the ultra conservative publication the new frontiersman
we asked new frontiersman editor hector godfrey for comment
cut to a clip of the editor being interviewed
we see seymour who we met at the news stand in the background
rorschach is an american patriot and we are proud that he reads this publication
during his capture kovacs assaulted and severely injured at least nine police officers shooting one officer with a grappling gun
that officer is in serious but stable condition
meanwhile in kashmir fighting continues to intensify
both india and pakistan alluded that the use of nuclear weapons is not out of the question laurie shuts off the tv not wanting to hear the war talk
that masks eaten rorschachs brains away
he wasnt always like that
we were a great team tactically he was brilliant
but i dont know something about this murder charge i just cant see rorschach shooting moloch
he shot a cop with a grappling gun
dont remind me i made that thing for him
but a regular gun just seems too ordinary and this war god
sometimes i wish i could just leave the planet
the old manhattan transfer
now thats funny
thats what you call jons teleportation
well not to his face
rorschach walks led by two correctional officers
from the cells prisoners shout insults death threats
rorschach stares ahead
the prison psychiatrist black amiable a mite portly sits across the table from rorschach sans mask cold and frightening
the psychiatrist reads his file
is that your name
the psychiatrist sits back considering rorschach carefully
let me explain your situation here walter
if you cooperate with me i may be able to convince them that you should to be treated medically in a hospital which i believe is best for you
but the authorities want to put you in general population
a prison is a prison
yes but the difference is downstairs
theyll eat you alive
he holds up a rorschach blot card
tell me what you see
flash of a dead dog
a pretty butterfly
the psychiatrist holds up another blot card
how about this one
what do you see here
flash of rorschach as a little boy watching his mother half naked embrace a man as he hands her some money
when she catches rorschach interrupting she smacks him in the face
shuts the door on him
some nice flowers
the psychiatrist eyes him dubious
holds up another card
flash of rorschach as a little boy looking up at two older boys teasing him
calling him son of a whore
rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the boys spits in his face
suddenly rorschachs face changes
he attacks the boy like a wild animal biting clawing
the psychiatrist sighs puts the cards down
tell me about rorschach
will you do that
why are you here with me doctor
because i want to make you well
theres other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine
of course theyre not famous
you want to know about rorschach doctor
ill tell you about rorschach rorschach walks through intermittent streetlights
in his glove he holds a photo of an angelic six year old girl
i was investigating a kidnap case
blair roche year old girl
i was young then
too soft on criminals
i let them live
a creepy deserted looking house
rorschach peers through a slatted fence at two german shepherds fighting
broke a mans arm to get a tip
led me to the missing girls location
the front door is kicked open smashing the lock
rorschach moves between a line of headless mannequins
in one corner rests an old wood burning stove
rorschach peers inside removes a blackened scrap of underwear
its decorated with little hearts and bears
i knew the girl was here
but when i searched the place i found nothing
rorschach enters the kitchen
out the window the dogs are fighting
rorschach opens a cupboard where a line of knives cleavers and a hacksaw hang on hooks
outside the snarling dogs get louder
slowly now rorschachs gaze moves from the knives
to the counter
he runs his gloved finger along red stained deep cut grooves in a thick wooden chopping block
his gaze continues out the window and then i found her
to the dogs still fighting over the bone which we now recognize as a small human femur that of the little girl
rorschach clenches his hands in fury his fists tremble and suddenly he relaxes
rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard
he reaches for a large cleaver
the child molester greasy and fat walks past the now silent fence
it was dark when the murderer got back
as dark as it gets
the man flicks a light switch
he draws a gun
he tries the light in here
he turns away as the body of a dead german shepard crashes through the window
he scrambles through the warehouse falling over mannequins
he fires madly into the dark
the second dog smashes into him from a second window
his gun goes flying
he scrambles backward against the stove
from behind rorschach cuffs the mans wrist to the stove
when the child molester sees that face he loses his bladder
rorschach just stares mask blots shifting you think i had something to do with that girl
wheres your evidence
rorschach calmly points to body of the dog
it is the same image rorschach saw in the first blot card
okay i confess
i kidnapped her
i killed her
men get arrested
rorschach raises the cleaver high over his head
rorschach contd dogs get put down
rorschach swings the cleaver down
blood spatters his mask
the psychiatrist listens paralyzed
a tremor of impact shook my arm
warm blood splashed my face
it was walter kovacs who screamed who closed his eyes it was rorschach who opened them again
the silence reels out rorschach contd you see doctor
god didnt kill that little girl fate didnt butcher her and destiny didnt feed her to those dogs
if god saw what any of us did that night he didnt seem to mind
from then on i knew
god doesnt make the world this way
the psychiatrist rises shakily
he crosses to the guard
i cant help him
the mess hall is packed hundreds of inmates eat dinner
the place goes instantly heavily silent
suddenly someone yells hey rorschach i heard your momma was a whore
a cruel ripple of laughter and the mass conversation begins again as rorschach takes his place in the food line
a huge prisoner moves in behind him
he whispers hey rorschach
youre pretty famous right
yknow im pretty famous too
maybe i can give you my autograph
the prisoner slides a shiv from his sleeve
rorschach doesnt register this
he waits for the fry cook behind the counter to turn away then casually reaches across and lifts the deep fryer basket from its mount the prisoner jabs the shiv
forward rorschach spins gripping the mans wrist and flinging the boiling grease into the mans face
the man shrieks like a fire whistle and crashes to the ground
the guards descend on rorschach
rorschach is calm as hes dragged away
as the injured mans screams fall away to weak bubbling hitches the room once again goes silent
rorschach eyes the fearful hateful eyes of the room marking each one
and in the silence he speaks his icy voice carrying easily
none of you understand
im not locked up in here with you
rorschach is placidly dragged off into darkness youre locked up in here with me
close on the nite owl uniform staring its blank empty stare
laurie stares back alone down here fascinated with the costume the gadgets the whole place
she wanders to the owl ship whose tarp has been pulled back
she runs her finger through the dust caked on the windshield
inside the ship laurie pulls open a hatch filled with alternate costumes designed for underwater work cold conditions heavy armor
she puts a cigarette in her mouth
all these gadgets and there isnt even a dash lighter she hits a button the lights inside go dim
she hits the button again to turn the lights back on but nothing dan returns home with some take out food
when he hears laurie scream downstairs
dan bolts for the basement door thoughts of the mask killer on his mind
dan descends the stairs and sees fire
dan grabs a fire extinguisher
where are you
dan sprays the fire
laurie stumbles from the smoke out of the owl ship
dans got the fire under control now
im so sorry i hit the wrong button
i was looking for the lighter in
i dont smoke
are you hurt
im fine but your ship ah thats mostly just soot
archies pretty resilient
short for archimedes merlins owl
im just glad youre okay
i heard you scream and well you know after the comedian still with the mask killer theory
rorschach is insane
maybe but the comedian murdered jon exiled someone tries to shoot adrian rorschach gets arrested
it makes me uneasy
dan goes to a bank of switches on the wall
flicking them the owl chamber lights up
hidden fans dissipate the smoke
how did you ever afford all this
my dad was in corporate banking
he left me quite a bit
which always surprised me
how did he die
he was shot
as dan cleans up laurie watches him like shes seeing him for the first time
you really do worry about me dont you
well yeah of course i worry about you i mean were yknow friends laurie takes off his glasses
and kisses him
its what dans been wanting all this time
but he pulls away
sorry i whats wrong
but dan is already walking up the stairs pathetic
lauries left there alone
the owl costume looming in the background
rorschach sits in his cell staring impassively at the wall
its been a long time rorschach
rorschach turns to see two thugs standing side by side one muscle bound the other very fat staring at him through the bars
pan down to reveal a midget between them the supervillain known as the big figure his silver hair combed neatly back a big cigar perched in his tiny mouth
chuckles through smoke i like that
but you know it is a small world in here
ive been in it for how long now billy
twenty years mr
twenty years since you and that owl fella put me away
rorschach that guy you burned is dying
could go any minute now
and when he does this place is gonna explode
then you die by inches
slams into the bars im gonna tear this guy a new hole
chuckling big figure walks off down the long shadowed corridor
rorschach continues staring straight ahead
close on dan naked on his knees in the center of an infinite field of blackness
no corners no exits
in the distance he sees a female form
desperate he runs to her
its laurie waiting for him in costume
she tears at him passionately
his skin suddenly tears away like wrapping paper
beneath the false skin dan wears his nite owl costume
confident he touches her face
she smiles with palpable heat
in the background a nuclear blast erupts
still kissing the dan wakes with a jolt sweat beaded on his forehead
the door opens
laurie stands in the shaft of light
is everything okay
i heard you coming down the stairs descending the stairs she finds dan before his costume naked
he fiddles with an owl wing throwing weapon
i feel so powerless so ive been afraid of this damn costume
afraid of how much i need it
he flings the owl wing crescent whizzing into the dark
lets take the ship out
whos to know
i used to be a masked avenger too remember
im used to getting up at three in the morning to do something stupid
besides im already a wanted lady youre already in trouble for hiding me how much more trouble can we be in
just give me a second cant go out like this
she jogs upstairs
dan turns to the empty waiting suit
pan up dans costumed body
the nite owl suit is fantastic intricate but above the belly
it just barely fits dan managing to click it closed
i cant believe it still fits
luckily i constructed it with material that was elastic and dan turns as laurie appears at the door decked in her black spandex
silk spectre looking every bit as good as seventeen form fitting
dan turns and sees his reflection in the owl ships window
laurie holds on as the owl ships engines roar to life
the ship rises into the air and slips easily into the tunnel
laurie watches the lights of the tunnel whiz by
at the end two big steel doors open allowing a passage up
lets have some cloud cover
thick fog pours from lower deck jets as the ship rises into an abandoned warehouse whose steel roof rolls back
laurie touches the window the sparkling city laid out below
its so beautiful hang on
dan banks wheeling the ship toward the veldt building
got to clean her up a bit
im sure adrian wouldnt want to impede the course of justice
heading straight for the building dan jigs at the last moment flying the ship through the v shaped waterfall in the skyscrapers center
the water washes clean the years of dust
the owl ship emerges sparkling like new
below a tenement building is engulfed in flame
dans jaw sets
he wheels the ship around and down
as they zoom closer they can see people screaming from the windows
theres children in there
im putting the water cannons on the lower stories
over the loudspeakers to laurie can you escort the people over
she watches him move quick confident
im on it
the ship extends an escape ramp with laurie on board
the residents forget their fear of fire for a moment as they soak in the spectacle of this sexy lady on this owl ship
if you could all form a line well have you out of here in just a moment
atop the ship dan latches the steering column into its roof socket
he stands takes a deep chest expanding breath
who has he been kidding
this is who he is
flicking a switch old jazz plays pleasantly
below the residents file on board in a daze at their surroundings
laurie grins at the music
anybody want coffee
fire rising behind dan wings the ship straight into frame
the owl ship rises leaving a grateful crowd behind
in the background fire trucks are just arriving
a firefighter looks up in time to see the owl ship disappear into the clouds
dan skims the clouds like a man waking from a dream
i cant believe we did that
that was actually fun yeah
he puts a hand on her shoulder
his eyes locked onto hers
he knows what he wants and this time hes not afraid of it he kisses her
running her hands up his cheeks they slide each others masks off
their mouths melt together
soft music plays
dan and laurie lie in a heap of discarded costumes
it was good wasnt it
yeah saving those people from the fire
taking archie out laurie swats him on the chest thats not what she meant
dan grins having fun with her
it you were unbelievable
what do we do next
dan sits up serious
ive been thinking about that
and i believe we have certain obligations to our fraternity
i think we should spring rorschach
the ship hovers silent in the clouds
the prisoner rorschach burned lies in bed his face completely bandaged hooked to an iv
when he flatlines
down the dark corridors a roar is building
big figure and his two thugs appear at the door
hes dead rorschach the riots already begun
while everyones distracted we thought wed bring you a housewarming gift
something from the machine shop
the fat thug wheels an electrical welder to the door
rorschach sits idly tearing his prison shirt into strips
hey boss ynotice
none of that small world tall order crap cuz he knows once we slice open this lock hes next on the block
the fat thug reddens
he dives forward hands swiping for rorschach
youre dead rorschach
we got a prison full of killers out here
whatve you got
rorschach spins wrapping a shirt strip around his wrists trapping the fat thugs hands inside the cell
rorschach snaps fat thugs pinky fingers
fat thug shrieks
rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars
dumb thug tries to reach the welder around fat thugs body
i cant reach the lock
should i cut the bars
this riot wont last
and ive been waiting twenty years for this big figure nods to the dumb thug who then grabs fat thugs neck
nothing personal big guy
boss you cant be serious
wait dumb thug snaps fat thugs neck
he then cuts off fat thugs hands with the welder pushes the corpse out of the way to reach the lock
big figure grins at rorschach
now you find out what the score is
come and get me
dan and laurie are back in costume
look dan im glad you were able to rediscover your calling in life but i think youre getting carried away
youre talking about springing a homicidal psychopath from prison
rorschach may be sick but i think hes on to something four heroes attacked in a week is not a coincidence
i mean that whole cancer thing with ion does that make sense to you
you didnt contract cancer from him
he says as lauries about to light a cigarette
she changes her mind
why would someone want to drive ion away
look whats happening now
with jon gone it looks like were headed for another world war
who would want that
outside the window the owl ship approaches a rooftop with a helipad
on the helipad is a helicopter with the veidt enterprises logo
i dont know
but i know someone who might be able to help
dan lands the owl ship on the roof
surprisingly adrian is awake packing his things hustling about his grand mansion as dan and laurie trail
youre leaving town
so you do believe rorschachs theory
right now im not concerned with this so called mask killer im concerned with the mass killer called war or have you not heard
calling out on
a wall sized mirror turns into a tv us aircraft carriers have already moved into the persian gulf and us battleships have left japan en route to the far east
its happening dan breaks away from the terrible news follows adrian
all the more reason we need to get to the bottom of this
maybe we can get jon to come back in the process and stop all this madness
nothing we do will bring jon back
glances at laurie but i think you know that already
and breaking rorschach out of prison certainly isnt the answer
rorschachs been the only one investigating this from the start
without him were starting at the beginning and we dont have that kind of time
we need your help adrian
im leaving dan
and i suggest you both do the same
adrian pulls on a thick winter coat and heads upstairs
adrian walks briskly to his idling copter propellers loudly cutting through the air
dan gives one last effort shouting
where are you going to go
it takes dan a moment to realize adrian is serious
by then adrians halfway into the helicopter
good luck dan
he says it sincerely
dan watches the helicopter fly off
dumb thug welds the lock glows red
rorschach backs away from the door as big figure trembles in excitement
i wanna smell this sonofabitch cooking
the lock melts away
rorschach climbs onto his bunk as dumb thug enters jabbing the electric welder at him menacingly
rorschach drives his heel into the porcelain toilet bowl shattering it
water spills across the floor
rorschach kicks dumb thug in the stomach dumb thug buckles then slips in the water dumb thug falls welder still in hand as he hits the water dumb thugs hand
fuses to the welder as electricity surges through him
he collapses smoking
never disposed of sewage with a toilet before
big figure looks very small and alone now two nothing
panic stricken big figure moves or rather runs
rorschach calmly follows him out of the cell
the owl ship tears through the sky the prison ahead on the horizon
dan has his game face on lauries still unsure
you dont have to do this
i know the whole crimefighting thing wasnt necessarily your choice in life
but this is
she moves next to him
but im not doing it for rorschach or even for jon
and im sure as hell not doing if for the comedian
they look at each other dan knows who shes doing it for
the owl ship is upon the prison now look
they see a riot below inmates spilling out into the yard overwhelming the correctional officers on the ground tower guards take shots at some of the inmates broken glass broken
furniture parts scattered through the yard smoke emits from inside the prison
hmm rorschach gets locked up in here and suddenly theres a riot
i wonder if thats a coincidence
they descend toward the hell of tear gas fire and violence
the tower guards stunned at the sight of the owl ship begin shooting at it
the bullets bounce right off
put your ear plugs in
the ship emits a piercing shriek
the inmates and guards fall to the ground in sonic agony
how are we going to find rorschach in all of this
when he and i were partners we each had tracking implants put under our skin so old archie here could find us if either one of us were ever in
lets see if rorschach kept his in
dan turns on the gps monitor
theres a blip on the screen
hes in that wing
dan steers the ship toward the maximum security wing
the owl ship stops to a hover position
the lower hatch opens and a ladder extends as laurie descends the ladder dan simply joyously leaps out his wings snap wide to glide him through the air
fires burn in the cells
shotguns and screams echo in the emergency lighting
archies owl shriek is dulled here its quiet
laurie and dan turn the corner searching
laurie spots the body of a dead guard
she crouches to take his pistol slips it into her waistband
how do we know hes still alive
they come upon rorschachs cell
dan sees the smoking corpse of dumb thug
sees the cut off hands of fat thug hanging from the bars
big figure runs turns a corner ducking into the bathroom
rorschach sees this and walks serenely after him
when dan and laurie enter the far hall
is that rorschach
hello daniel ms
excuse me i just have to visit the mens room
he disappears into the dark bathroom
laurie watches after him in stunned disbelief
oh for christs sake
hey it happens
i remember i lost a big arrest like that once
had to redesign the costume after that rorschach exits the bathroom wiping his hands
we can leave now
he walks off
are you sure youre ready
we dont want to go diving head first into things
im sure there are many whod agree with you
behind them bloody water floods from the bathroom door as they go
the trio crosses the roof as dan calls archie by remote
good to see you in uniform daniel
finally taking the mask killer seriously
of course you havent been attacked yet
funny most everyone else has
whats that supposed to mean
we came here to rescue you asshole
i had to turn the screechers off so well be drawing fire
the owl ship rises to the roof
they all jump in
under heavy fire the owl ship zooms off leaving the chaos behind
dan weaves and whips the ship into the sky above the clouds
satisfied that theyve escaped dan allows himself a grin
he looks at laurie who grins back
rorschach you remember how to handle archie
i believe so
rorschach sits in the pilots seat
dan turns to laurie high on adrenaline and love
dan moves in to kiss her daniel
give us a second i dont think this can wait
what is it dan looks up through the windshield and sees dr
manhattan walking across the clouds straight for the it s him
the ship collides with dr
manhattan who passes through into the cabin with a shower of blue particles hello laurie
they said you were on mars
i am on mars
you and i are about to have a conversation there
what are you talking about
you are going to try to convince me to save the world
youre taking her to mars
no she cant laurie i dont know about laurie looks at dan then at dr
comprehending i have to go dan
jon and i were going to talk
maybe well find some way out of this mess the worlds gotten itself in
ill be okay
laurie and dr
manhattan burst into particles theyre gone
dan stares at the space where laurie just was
no time for heartbreak daniel
dan notes two blips on the radar
two nypd helicopters appear behind the owl ship inside the owl ship dan takes the controls
lets try and lose them in the city
he hits the jets heading for the new york skyline
a red vista
manhattan and laurie appear atop a rise
what do you think
hhhhhhh laurie grips her throat and tumbles down the hill
she rolls into jon waiting for her at the bottom
she claws at him
these things sometimes slip my mind
he touches her mouth forming a small atmosphere around her
she heaves in air retching and choking at the same time
jon you stupid bastard
listen you better not forget this air supply or whatever it is looking up oh shit
laurie stands up before jons huge glass palace
im on mars
the owl ship weaves around the buildings trying to shake the copters
but the pilots are good staying on its tail
the owl ship shoots out of the city over the water
dan loops archie around
and heads straight for a subway tunnel just clearing it
the owl ship skims the sides of the tunnel sparks flying when a subway appears
theyre heading straight for it
tactical error daniel
i know they head straight for the subway when the tunnel opens up dan swerves to the adjacent track just in time
the owl ship emerges from the subway tunnel
when one of the nypd copters cuts it off
dan accelerates weaving archie around the skyscrapers the empire state building
but the copters still there
dan cuts around the united nations building
the copter follows the owl ship around to the east river but the owl ship is nowhere to be found the copter hovers there
the owl ship rests at the bottom of the river hidden a group of gang members with the black and yellow bandanas who confronted dan on the subway earlier in
the film walks down the block when another gang member catches up running
yo yall hear
some super owl dude broke rorschach outta prison
that fool put my cousin in a you say nite owl broke him out
didnt he write a book or something
he lives over a garage near here
does he now hollis sits up in bed tv on cnn grainy shaky clips of the owl ship
hes on the phone beaming
its just like old times sal
nite owl and silk spectre back at it again
cut to sally jupiter on the other end in california watching the same footage
i always knew laurie had it in her
sorry for waking you hollis
i may be retired from the costume but my sleeping habits have never changed
theres a knock at holliss door
who theres someone at the door
it might be dan and laurie they may need help
i better go
hollis hangs up heads to the door excited
he opens the and the gang members pile into him
the picture slows down
hollis turns mouth bleeding
hollis pov is sepia toned
the gang appears as a collection of villains in costumes
slow sepia a young hollis is in his old costume
the voices come from the present while hollis is lost in the past
in his slo mo world hollis pastes at villain in the mouth in reality he gets nailed
this intercutting continues until the gang leader picks up the gold statue of hollis in costume whose base reads in gratitude hold on derf are you sure this is the
right guy he hes just an old man
then im probably doing him a favor
hollis old again looks up
the shadow of the statue the owl ship moves slowly through the water
i hate this
how long are we going to stay down here
dan says nothing
rorschach puts on his costume
youre letting fear paralyze you
and that woman hey
we took enough unnecessary risks bringing archie up so you could get your spare costume
we stay put until it cools down out there theyre looking for us
cowering in the sludge from the authorities thats unnecessary
rorschach pulls his mask on turns
while we waste time the mask killer gets closer
we need to get to pyramid industries
dan sits at the computer
i know you told me already
im tapping into all the databases finding out about the company
sitting at a computer
we need to trace the killer hit up underworld contacts squeeze people
youve forgotten how we do things
youve been lazing around too long
listen i have had it
who the hell do you think you are
you live off people while insulting them and no one complains because they think youre a goddamn lunatic
dan turns away shaking
he leans against the console
i shouldnt have said that
maybe youre right maybe dan turns
rorschach holds out an open hand
you are a good friend
im sorry that it is sometimes difficult with me
touched dan shakes his hand
an awkward lovely moment
hey forget it its okay man
releasing his hand with some effort dan sits invigorated
its time to head up
the owl ship bursts through the surface of the water lets really start plumbing the depths
jon leads laurie into the glass palace
our conversation commences when you surprise me with the information that you and dreiberg have been sleeping together
know about me and dan
but in a few moments youre going to tell me
jon im having enough problems right now without getting into your predestination crap
why does my perception of time distress you so
if you already know the future why were you surprised when i left you or when that reporter ambushed you
why even debate if you already know the outcome
because everything is pre ordained
even my responses
this is so typical of you
do you know what a relief it is to be with somebody human like dan
you mean youre sleeping with dan dreiberg
contemplating this he steps to the balconys edge
but you already know
you said i said often that you were my only remaining link with the world
now that link is shattered
dont you see the futility of asking me to save a world that i no longer have any stake in
the earth is too important to hinge on one relationship
not to me
my red world here means more to me than your blue one
ill show you around if you like
the giant glass palace begins to rumble
are you doing this
im not in the mood for jokes
believe me i fully understand the gravity of the situation
the clockwork glass palace rises high into the air the owl ship approaches the large warehouse building that is pyramid industries
the ship lands in the alley nearby
dan and rorschach exit the ship
rorschach goes to the door which is ajar dan and rorschach slowly make their way down peering into rooms
the place looks abandoned scattered papers dusty file cabinets leftover computer components you sure this is the correct location daniel
specializes in industrial plastics
at least they did
they enter the large dark industrial section of the building
they pass huge processing vats conveyor belts
i tapped into all the databases tax records business registries real estate records trying to get a bead on whos behind pyramid but its a never ending paper trail
rorschach investigates ahead when dan catches some movement he turns his flashlight to find a few homeless people squatting in the warehouse
upon seeing dan in
costume the homeless people run away
theyre harmless rorschach
rorschach is looking down at something
dan heads over and sees a dead body in the early stages of decomposition
he turns the body over bullet between the eyes just like moloch but we recognize the corpse its journalist doug roth
hey i know this man
journalist who grilled dr
manhattan on national television
no i didnt watch that interview
this was the guy who was doing a story on adrian when i went to see him
journalist set up dr
manhattan was probably working to set up veidt also
dan stands there thinking
as if hit with an epiphany
he opens his mouth like he cant believe what hes going to say
what what if its adrian
makes no sense
on the surface it doesnt but hear me out adrians the only one who couldve taken on the comedian in hand to hand combat
hes the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up dr
and adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast
he probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list
that doesnt explain the attempt on veidts life
if we say that adrian set that up himself he couldve had the hitman shoot his assistant first
it was a risk but but why
i dont know
lets go ask him
the endless white blanket that is antarctica is interrupted by a splash of color in the distance
as we approach we see that the color is a bio dome a tropical rainforest inside
this is part of karnak adrian veidts arctic fortress
adrian stands at the entrance of the bio dome amidst the exotic foliage where a group of scientists and engineers are gathered
they all hold champagne flutes adrian raises his glass for a toast when the head scientist interrupts
veidt may i
by all means eric
i just would like to say that when i was first offered this position i was hesitant
a multi year commitment to work in antarctica
but the opportunity to experiment with dr
manhattans atomic fusion energy was too great for me to pass up too great for any of us to pass up
and now that our work is finished and we finally get to go home i can say that it was all worth it
veidt you are a genius
the world will be a better place because of you
i certainly hope so
the group applauds
then they sip their champagne
all except for adrian the group goes around congratulating each other when suddenly the head scientist collapses choking
the others surround him trying to help when one by one they each start collapsing themselves poisoned by the champagne
adrian regards them all writhing on the floor and leaves
in the alley the gang members who killed hollis mason stand around the owl ship arguing amongst themselves when dan appears behind them
something i can help you with boys
they all spin around frightened at the costume
to gang leader i told you we had the wrong guy
the gang leader shits his pants as dan steps closer
l listen i didnt mean to kill that old guy
things just got outta hand what old guy
hearing screams outside rorschach bursts out of the
and sees dan gripping the bloody gang leader by the throat choking him as the other gang members flee
you and the rest of your gang youre all dead
you know how much fire power ive got floating out there
oh god damn
god damn god damn god damn dan begins to break up
rorschach quietly pulls him away
not now daniel
the owl ship slows to a hover besides an older building
dreiberg is convinced that veidt is behind everything
apparently the owl ship is capable of the trip to antarctica but are we
i cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent
veldt is faster than dreiberg and myself
he used to joke that he was fast enough to catch a bullet
i believe he could
he could kill us both alone in the snow
no one would know
rorschach descends the ladder goes to the door of the building
he places his journal in an envelope
i have done my best to make this legible
whether i am alive or dead upon this reading know that whatever the nature of this conspiracy adrian veldt is responsible
he drops the envelope into the mail slot climbs back up the ladder
i appreciate your recent support and hope the world survives long enough for this to reach you
for my own part i regret nothing
i have lived my life free of compromise and step now into the shadow without complaint
rorschach disappears into the dark hatch
the owl ship blasts off
disappearing just as seymour arrives
seymour picks up the mail and walks inside
the editor walks in as seymour goes through the mail
is that dulmages editorial cartoon
its the mail
hey cool someone sent us their journal
earlier today i came across what appeared to be a suicide
it was later learned to be a homicide
someones time was up
wars coming seymour i dont wanna hear some knobs life story
chuck it in the crank file
seymour tosses rorschachs journal into a pile of letters
lauries hair blows in the cold wind
she lowers her head
jon serves her some water
cant you just tell me how this all ends and save us the trouble
it ends with you in tears
you mean i lose
you dont come back to earth
i return to earth at some point
the streets are filled with death
you mean theres going to be a war
an actual nuclear war
i cant be sure
im still experiencing some static interference preventing any clear vision of what lies ahead
tachyons are a rare occurrence
the detonation of nuclear warheads could conceivably be the cause
jon youve got to stop it
everyone will die
and the universe will not even notice
see the dual moons
arent they breathtaking
above two moons cross overhead
one is huge crimson red the smaller is a delicate shell pink
youre right jon what does human life matter next to a a neutrino
look im not going to debate you when you clearly dont see anything terribly miraculous about life
i guess quantum physics doesnt allow for miracles
no thermodynamic miracles are oh god jon
land this thing
on the argyre planitia
as you wish
the structure descends
laurie stomps down the stairs
thats it then
you can send me back to earth to fry with dan and my mom and all the other worthless humans
and look you were wrong
you said this ended with me in tears and see
not a damp eye in the house
maybe youre wrong about everything
jon is waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs
you complain that i refuse to see life on lifes terms
and yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective
if only youd try to see the whole continuum lifes pattern youd understand
but you deliberately shut it out as if afraid to see
im not afraid okay
you want me to see things your way
go ahead do that thing you do
she stands there arms folded waiting
then just like earlier in the lab jon touches her head same flashback as before in lauries childhood home
were in lauries pov as a little girl
theres arguing downstairs
laurie goes down to investigate
she comes upon the kitchen door ajar
she can see her parents inside arguing
you wanted to hear it so im telling you okay
thats what i had before
i was a hero goddammit
its not my fault you got old
what do you have to complain about
im putting food on the table for you and your child
why dont you give your friend eddie a call
maybe he can give you a better life
it was a mistake one time
am i never and then they notice laurie looking at them
tears run down little lauries face
her parents are laurie breaks away from ion and drops down to her knees tears flowing
no no no no not him the comedian was your father
but he attacked your mother
searching in his mind two years later he came back to her to make amends
and you were conceived on that day
laurie whips a bottle at the palace and the huge glass construction crumbles
jon protects them with a force field as debris collapses around them
laurie sobs in the echoing silence
jons eyes shut
he seems to feel
a tear slips down his cheek
lauries realization is a revelation for ion
the comedian is my father
i guess my life is just one big joke
i dont think your life is a joke
well of course youre going to say that
but ive changed my mind
there are miracles in your world that are worth preserving
but you were saying
i tried to explain
thermodynamic miracles events with odds against so astronomical like oxygen turning into gold
i have longed to witness such a thing and yet i neglect that in human coupling millions upon millions of cells compete to create life over generation after generation until
finally your mother loves a man edward blake the comedian a man she has every reason to hate
and out of that contradiction against unfathomable odds it was you only you that emerged
to distill so specific a form from all of that chaos your creation is like
turning air into gold
but if my birth is a miracle you you could say that about anyone
yes anyone in the world
but the world is so crowded with miracles that they become commonplace and we forget
they stand there in silence
connected for the first time in years
dry your eyes
from above we see the full crater the argyre planitia
round with two eye like boulders set side by side a ridge of land curling below
like a smiley face
and lets go home
the owl ship sails through a towering cloud bank
the coast approaches as snow starts to fall
dan stares ahead stoic
thinking about hollis laurie and adrian
he glances at a monitor tracking heat signatures
theres a large signal ahead
ive got a large reading ahead
anything thats emitting that much heat out here must be a pretty big facility
were not going to make it are we
rorschach says nothing
when a halting whine sputters from the engines
a huge cliff appears before them
the engines theyre icing up hold on
dan pulls the stick back
the ship shudders upward
the ship tiny before the massive ice wall climbs slowly
its going to be close
the wall is yards away now the top most edge barely in view
and then we just lost the engines find something to grab on to
the ship barely clears the cliff
bouncing hard it skips across the snow like a stone finally crashing into a drift
dan opens the hatch
shrieking wind blows the snow in
dan pulls on a white fur lined snow owl costume
the engines are de icing
you sure i cant fit you with something warmer
fine like this
rorschach pulls up his trench collar against the bitter wind
dan pulls two stand up hover scooters from an outside hatch
they exchange a look and ride the scooters off into the snow
adrian dressed in his ozymandias costume sits alone in the massive hall opposite a wall of giant plasma screens which show various television news channels showing all the images adrian
sighs and hits the remote the screens become one image alexander the great slicing the gordian knot
by adrians feet is an exotic lynx
its unnatural beauty almost hides a feral danger in its eyes
adrian pets the beast
see this painting
alexander the great
before his conquest of phoenicia he struck north for gordium where the worlds greatest puzzle waited
a great knot impossible to untie
for a young man determined to rule the world it was a challenge he couldnt resist
so he sliced it in two with his sword
lateral thinking you see
suddenly the lynx stands growls
what is it girl
he hits the remote the tv screens switch to multiple views of dan and rorschach heading toward karnak
its all right girl
everythings all right
flying on the scooter dan wipes frost and fog from his goggles
he then looks up and sees karnak a gargantuan glass pyramid rising out of the snow the bio dome attached to it
adrian watches dan and rorschach reach the door on the monitors
really getting even this far is an admirable effort given their limitations
of course the ice theyre skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks
lets hope they dont overstep themselves
on the monitors dan takes a laser torch to the door
lets hope they know when to stop
having burnt through the control panel dan pushes the huge door open
they enter the grand palace dwarfed by its macedonian massiveness
i dont understand any of this
adrians a pacifist
hes never killed anyone in his life
hes a vegetarian for christs sake
hitler was a vegetarian
if youre squeamish leave him to me
we wont get a second chance
dan and rorschach pass the wall of plasma screens into the dining hall where adrian eats alone at a long table
though theyre only a few yards away adrian doesnt appear to see them hidden by some pillars
dan and rorschach signal to each other quiet
adrian eats and rorschach rushes him from behind adrian moves at the last second grabs rorschachs arm elbows him in the chest spins and backhand fists him sending him flying
mind your manners
dan draws his pen laser
adrian dont make me adrian picks up a golden serving tray off the table as dan fires
adrian deflects the laser with the tray then discus slings the tray into dans nose
blood sprays dan drops to his knees
adrian turns his back on them calm
what can i do for you
you killed the comedian
you set up rorschach
you created pyramid industries hired all those people gave them cancer and blamed it on jon
dammit adrian what are you trying to do
what we always intended to improve the world
as adrian speaks rorschach sneaks up behind him with a fork
he tries to stab adrian in the back but adrian effortlessly dodges the blow grabs rorschachs mask twists it then knees him in the gut
rorschach drops to the floor
adrian starts walking out of the hall
dan helps rorschach up and they follow
i never intended to kill the comedian that was an accident
part of his duties as a government operative was to keep track of all former masked heroes make sure there was no rocking of the boat
he must have liked rorschach because he allowed him to continue to exist
i had thought that the comedian might be incompetent but he disproved that hypothesis when he discovered what was really going on
here in karnak no easy task
even my staff was unaware i made sure to keep each department separate
the comedian was appalled by my plan but still he understood the scope of what i was trying to accomplish
frankly i never thought hed actually talk
but by the time he visited poor moloch he was cracking badly
so i had to kill him
as they enter the control hall rorschach moves to attack adrian again when he and dan hear a growl
the lynx steps in between protecting its master
after blake i neutralized jon a plan nearly a decade in the works after analyzing confidential psychological profiles which predicted his withdrawal from human existence
by then rorschachs mask theory though erroneous needed to be addressed so i faked my own assassination why take that risk
what if the hitman shot you first instead of your assistant
i suppose id have to be fast enough to catch the bullet then wouldnt i
adrian smiles enigmatically
after apprehending my own assassin i shoved a cyanide capsule in his mouth disposing of him and soon after that the journalist doug roth tying up all the loose ends
if you will
then i knew nothing stood in the way of my triumph
adrian what are you going to do
im firing a beam of concentrated energy synthesized from dr
manhattan himself into the hearts of nine key regions around the globe crossing all traditional politics and ideologies
paris tehran kashmir beijing taiwan pyongyang london jerusalem new york destroying approximately three million people
three million people
listen to his voice
rorschach hes making it up
i understand your disbelief dan
when i began the plan ten years ago my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice
see the comedian was correct
what we were doing with the watchmen was pointless the savage nature of humankind would inevitably lead to the end of the world
so in order to save the world i had to trick it to frighten the world towards salvation with historys greatest practical joke
by killing millions of people
and when were you planning on doing this
dan my dear friend i am the smartest man in the world do you seriously think id explain my master stroke if there remained even the slightest chance of you
affecting its outcome
i did it thirty minutes ago
a beam of blue energy shoots into the sky from karnak
the energy infects the clouds charged with crashing erratic blue lightning spreading out across the globe as the news vendor opens his stand
the president and his cabinet look out the windows up at the electric blue clouds were with the pakistani and indian soldiers from earlier stopping their gun fight to look
up at the sky in hindi were with the chinese battleships from earlier in mandarin were with the israelis from earlier watching on screen in hebrew realization is dawning on the faces of the new yorkers
suddenly the sound of a rising howling wind and the lightning strikes begin crashing to earth with savage blistering force
their expended blue energy spreads like people scream and run
as the light overtakes the unlucky ones they are instantly blown to ash world montage as is the news vendor the pakistani and indian soldiers the chinese battleships the israeli
missile control room paris the great wall of china
the smoke filled street is silent
then glowing particles coalesce slamming together to form jon and laurie but jons teleportation falters shorting out
they fall from the air
laurie drops roughly to her knees
god jon what was that
jon looks around the street
even he is awe struck
laurie looks up and screams
thousands of black silhouettes are imprinted on the street and the walls
there is no rubble some buildings have simply disintegrated
was it a war
it doesnt seem like not a war
dont know what it was
manhattan looks up into the sky studying it
take me out of here jon
this must be very upsetting for you
i have traced the source of the tachyon particles to antarctica
anywheres better than here
pull out from the televisions news reports from all over the world documenting the tragic destruction caused by dr
dan turns away shaken
murdered millions of people
re lynx call off your cat
call off your cat and face me
dont you understand
ive ended the war ive ended all wars
because of their fear of ion ive forced the world into everlasting peace
by committing the biggest mass murder in history
you have no right to play god
i wasnt playing god
suddenly theres a loud beeping in the hall
the lynx growls
adrian switches the monitors to the security cameras which show ion and laurie materialize in the snow
speak of the devil
laurie vomits in the snow
adrian of course
who else would have the resources wait this is adrians compound
are you saying hes responsible for this jon walks toward the building entranced
yes he killed blake and millions of others
excuse me daniel im talking to laurie ninety seconds ago what daniel
millions of others
jon dont start that crap now not here
its these tachyons
theyre muddling things up
id better follow him in a burst hes gone
jon materializes in the hall
adrian sprints like lightening out of the room followed by the lynx
no dont let him escape
jon stop him he killed millions of people who knows what else hell do
jon walks calmly after adrian
jon are you okay
you seem drugged
yes he killed blake and millions of others
excuse me daniel im talking to laurie ninety seconds ago what
its these tachyons
theyre muddling things up
id better follow him jon follows adrian into the next room
jon enters the maze of advanced technology
adrian dont be foolish
even if i cant predict where im going to find you i can turn the walls to glass
the tachyons were clever but its time to give up jon spots the lynx in a metal corridor
if i must let us follow this through to the bitter end
on the other side of the walls is adrian waiting by a control panel
he takes one last look at his lynx
forgive me girl
jon enters the corridor with the lynx adrian flicks a switch
the lynx fur stands on end as energy crackles between the metal walls
the lynx howls
adrian dont light blasts through jon and the lynx both are obliterated
adrian peers around the corner winded by his success
you know i really wasnt sure that would work
laurie aims the prison guards pistol at him
youre such an asshole
adrian cries out leaps at her as she fires and hits adrian
dan and rorschach find them as laurie approaches adrians body laurie shoot him again
adrians hand falls from his chest to the floor blood trickling as his palm opens holding a bullet inside
adrian opens his eyes and kicks her in the stomach sending her flying back
if youve hurt her ill oh dan
adrian exits as dan helps the winded laurie to her feet
together rorschach dan and laurie follow him back to adrian approaches his wall of tv screens when jon now feet tall smashes through the wall
adrian crawls desperately away grasping for his remote on the floor
as jon approaches him jon shrinks to six feet
restructuring myself was the first trick i learned
it didnt kill me before did you seriously think it would kill me now
you are nothing but a man
and the worlds smartest man means no more to me than its smartest termite
out of tricks out of traps adrian lifts the remote
what is that adrian
some new ultimate weapon
yes you could say that
adrian goes back to his wall of screens watching the news reports
we hear sound bites and images india and pakistan immediately call for truce china stands down us withdraws forces israel agrees on cease fire
tears stand in adrians eyes
he raises his fists in triumph
i did it
i did it
ive saved earth from hell
next i will elevate her to the vaulting stature of heaven
you cant get away with this
will you expose me undoing the peace so many have just died for
morally youre in checkmate just like the comedian was
jon examines the many screens taking it all in
im afraid hes correct
exposing adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again
all we did was fail to stop him from saving earth
we we cant say anything about this youre joking of course
rorschach walks toward the exit
rorschach wait a second
lets talk this out
not even in the face of armageddon
adrian and jons eyes meet an unspoken communication
seeing this dan runs after rorschach
across the hall ion materializes between rorschach and the exit
where are you going rorschach
back to the owl ship
back to america
people must be told
evil must be punished
rorschach you know i cant let you do that
dan is halfway there
rorschach removes his mask tears stand in his eyes
suddenly youve rediscovered humanity
if you had cared from the start none of this would be necessary
none of this would have happened
so what are you waiting for
jon waves his hand and blows rorschach apart
dan collapses to his knees sobbing
jon contemplates the burn mark where rorschach stood only seconds ago then disappears reappearing across the hall where laurie is
she is also in tears watching all the horrible footage on the tv screens
im leaving this galaxy
for one a little less complicated
i i thought you regained an interest in human life
i think maybe ill create some
he kisses her on the cheek jon id hoped to talk to you
ive made myself feel every death see every innocent face ive murdered to save humanity you understand dont you
without condoning or condemning i and with that he disappears
across the hall dan recovers from mourning rorschach
he stands gritting his teeth
walks toward adrian
whats on your mind dan
you want to kill me
you might have created peace but not at the expense of justice
you need to pay for what youve done
that doesnt sound like you dan
that sounds more like rorschach
adrian readies himself
laurie breaks away from the tv screens
only youre not rorschach are you now
how do you expect to succeed where he failed
tell you the truth adrian
dan flies at adrian fighting like a madman for his life
his fighting style has changed
dans newfound brutality is informed by everything hes learned from rorschach
but adrian is the best
he takes dans attacks apart with ease delivering blows which would kill a man not quite so focused on his goal
in the end he catches dans final strike and twists
dans arm snaps easily
laurie charges adrian
with one hand adrian blocks her attack grabs her by the hair and slams her to floor knocking her out
dan falls to his knees bloody and beaten
out of tricks out of time he searches his belt for something anything and finds one last owl wing
the wings snap out
desperate he who merely snatches the owl wing out of the air
prepares to finish dan off
i have to say ive always thought your choice of an owl was quite juvenile
ive always liked owls adrian sees that dan has pulled one last item from his belt
adrian steps on dans wrist bones crunching
dans hand falls open revealing the owl ship remote
because you can never hear them coming
behind adrian floodlights blaze targeting adrian as the owl ship crashes through the window and into adrian and dan
silence but for the tinkling of glass falling to the floor
dan tries to stand but he falls his left leg shattered
most of adrian has been crushed under the ship
he coughs a fine blood spray
adrian looks over to dan dying
dont regret my actions
i know in my heart
i did the right thing
so do i
adrian lays back calm accepting and dies
dan sits painfully in the passenger seat as laurie tries to pilot the ship out of adrians bedroom
now pull the stick to the left the ship rises and turns awkwardly in the hall smashing out more glass
now the thrusters
she hits the thrusters
the ship flies from the control room
its afterburners igniting the room and adrians body
the owl ship rises into the sky the pyramid of karnak blazing from its tip like a roman candle
dan watches out the window until his eyes slip shut time has passed
the disintegrated buildings are being rebuilt
the shock of the attack is wearing off and though the streets may not be as crowded as they once were a sense of normalcy is returning
sally jupiter walks the sidewalk looking for an address
sally mixes herself a tall drink at the bar
sally calls out you sure you dont want a drink
we finally see laurie now her hair dyed appearance changed
mom i just want to get this out of the way
i know eddie blake the comedian i know he was my father
sally downs her drink immediately starts making another
it it was years later he stopped by out of the blue and and apologized
i dont know i just couldnt stay mad
it just happened laurie kisses her mothers teary cheek
peoples lives take them strange places
you never did anything wrong by me
sally jumps as a click whir sound comes from a bookcase
what the hell is that
oh thats dan
home from work
the bookcase slides aside and a blond dan enters from the secret elevator
he is trim and confident cheeks flushed with color
buttoning up his shirt he spots sally
excuse me i should clean up
sally wipes her runny make up goes to the bathroom
dan and laurie embrace kiss
any bad guys last night
there are always bad guys
even in todays world
slow laurie turns to the window
looks out at the new york skyline being rebuilt
will it be alright
the world i mean
he puts his arm around her shoulder
as long as no one ever finds out that adrian was behind it all the public will think ion is still up there watching
the threat remains and everything should be fine
just fine close on a yellow happy face suddenly splotched with red printed on a t shirt now stained with ketchup
we pull back and find seymour wears the shirt eating a burger when the editor bursts in
what the hell do you got for me
we got nothing to write about
everyone in the country every country in the world is holding hands now singing songs about peace and love its like were living in a goddamn global hippie commune
um i guess i can look for stuff in the crank file
take some initiative
run whatever you like seymour turns to the pile of submissions known as the crank file where rorschachs journal sits on top
seymour reaches i leave it entirely in your hands
and picks up rorschachs journal
just as hes about to open it we cut to black
