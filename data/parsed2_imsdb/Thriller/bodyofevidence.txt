b if window
href b b by brad mirman second draft over the black we hear the sounds of two people making love
a mans voice moans passionately
andrew marsh lies on his back in bed
he is a frail looking man in his early sixties with thinning gray hair
on top of him is a much younger woman
although her back is to us we catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side to side
we see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman
she moves wildly grinding her hips into him her head arched back her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts
she reaches down grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards forcing him deeper inside her
they move together faster and faster
the camera slowly begins to pull back
as it does we see what we are watching is on a television
further back still
we see two uniformed police officers standing before the television watching the act
the camera begins to pan around the room
rain streaks down the windows of the room lightning flashes outside
a video camera is set up on a tripod
more plain clothes police looking dusting talking
we continue to pan
we can now see it is the same room on the tape
on the bed lies the naked body of andrew marsh a sheet covering his lower torso
his face is ashen mouth open his dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare
the last instant of his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain
lightning fills the night sky
thunder booms overhead
the wind whips the rain furiously against anything in its path
the camera moves slowly along rows of beautiful homes
at the end is a cul de sac
several police cars are in the driveway their red lights flashing
a four door sedan pulls into the driveway
john cardenas steps out into the rain
he is a handsome latin in his thirties with hard chiseled features and black slicked backed hair
he does not run through the rain he walks
detective reese a man who looks more like an accountant than a homicide detective runs out to meet him
is it marsh
just a hint of sadness shows on cardenas face
it lasts an instant then its gone
sir do you mind if we get out of the rain
cardenas doesnt move
he ignores the question
who found him
she was here
she stopped by to pick up some papers
reese starts for the house
cardenas looks up into the night sky
a flash of lightning fills the screen
pull back to reveal a police photographer snapping pictures of marsh in bed
cardenas enters followed by reese
he moves through the forensic and medical teams
anything cardenas feels about the gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of indifference
standing by the bed is assistant district attorney roger troxell a short baby faced man
cardenas looks down at the body then over at the medical examiner dr
henry mccurdy a portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes
about three hours
ill have everything you need tomorrow
take a look at this
reese points to the nightstand drawer and troxell opens it
on top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal spray
inside are ropes handcuffs and an assortment of sexual this guy was into some kinky shit
cardenas looks at the various sexual devices then walks out of the room
joanne braslow sits on chair
her eyes are tired red from crying
she is mid thirties attractive but her looks come more from effort than nature expensive hair cut the right cosmetics
she has a corporate look to her
cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her
miss braslow im district attorney john cardenas
you arrived at what time tonight
a little after eleven
why did you come by
i had some papers to pick up
do you know who mr
marsh was with
i assume his girlfriend
you wouldnt know her address would you
no but i can get it for you
cardenas walks down the corridor with mccurdy
marsh wasnt alone
we found traces of sperm on the sheets
the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood
whatd he die of
the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest
the official cause
thats what my report will read
but theres more
they reach a door and stop
its speculative at this point
marsh had advanced arterial disease
his heart attack was induced by excessive aerobic activity in conjunction with the drug
mccurdy enters the room
cardenas thinks for a moment then follows
spacious and sparsely furnished
the walls are empty
no commendations plaques or photographs to add prestige to the office
cardenas steps into the room and looks at mccurdy who is already seated next to reese and troxell
to mccurdy what are you saying henry
that his girlfriend fucked him to death
a trace of a grin shows on cardenas face
he walks over to the window and stares outside
reese troxell and mccurdy wait as he thinks
cardenas turns back to the room
what can we prove
we know marsh had a head cold
we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand
the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant but for a much shorter time
hed keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking
any prints on the nasal spray
marshs and rebecca lawsons
what if he did know what was in it
a lot of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public
cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want
can we put rebecca lawson at the scene
a man across the street from marsh saw her drive up about four thirty sunday afternoon
and her prints are all over the place
cardenas stands and walks to a dart board on the wall
he gathers the darts moves back and tosses one
marshs cardiologist told me that after marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking quit drinking and started exercising every day
does that sound like a guy whod start shoveling cocaine up his nose
what did he say about miss lawson
he can remember at least one occasion and the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied marsh to the office
cardenas throws another dart at the board
so she knew about his heart
i also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with marsh
theres no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting miss lawson
what about the will
thats the best part
she gets it all everything
gray clouds hang over head
a light drizzle falls
a group of mourners hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave
in the b
the press is visible held back my private security a woman dressed in black stands in the front of the mouners her face hidden behind a hat and veil
raymond sattler a tall distinguished looking man in his sixties stands beside her
he supports his weight with the aid of a cane
the service concludes
sattler along with several other people offer her their condolences
joanne braslow is there
she does not go over to rebecca
cardenas and reese stand off to the side by a large oak tree
cardenas watches and waits
he steps forward as sattler leads the woman by
the woman stops
her back is to cardenas
im district attorney john cardenas
rebecca lawson removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around
she is in her late twenties
a deep pain fills her face controlled but evident
her eyes are tired heavy from crying but no tears show now
this is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others
although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful
so beautiful that even cardenas usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is
i dont think that this is the time or the place
i just wanted to introduce myself and inform miss lawson that there will be an inquiry
an inquiry into what
for starters id like to know why she left the house and didnt report the death
because he wasnt dead when she left and even if he was not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isnt a crime
did i say it was a natural death
cardenas and rebecca lock eyes
rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation
cardenas nods and walks away
in the b
we see joanne staring at rebecca with hostility
large and homey
a fire roars in the fireplace
frank dulaney sits on his couch as he goes over some paperwork
he is mid thirties powerful self assured
sharon dulaney enters
she is an attractive woman in her early thirties
she kisses him on the cheek then pushes his paperwork aside and sits down on his lap
youre on vacation remember
youre supposed to be relaxing
i am relaxing
pushing the papers aside this is not relaxing
playing along and i suppose youre going to show me how to relax
if you want me to
im always open to learning new things
she kisses him soft gentle kisses
dulaney puts his arms around her and kisses her harder
im beginning to see what you mean
why dont we go upstairs and work on the advanced course
ive got to finish a counter offer on the bergman property
the moment is passing by
a trace of frustration shows on dulaneys face this is obviously not a new occurrence
cant it wait
no it has to be done by tomorrow
the moment is gone
dulaney forces an understanding smile
he looks towards the door and sees his eight year old son hey slugger
ready for bed
michael walks over to this parents
the phone rings
dulaney answers it
into phone hello
well i was sort of planning on
hangs up to sharon that was sattler
he thinks the d
s going to file on rebecca lawson
he wants me in the office tomorrow morning
were supposed to go to the lake
what can i do
he is the boss
he could let you have your vacation
dad is it true what theyre saying about that miss lawson lady
what are they saying
the kids at school say she humped mr
marsh to death
hey you know better than that
what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something
she allegedly humped him to death
sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh
i swear the both of you
to dulaney some example you set
imitating her some example you set
he makes a funny face at michael who laughs and makes one back
dulaney grabs him and starts tickling him
michael screams with laughter as he tries to tickle him back
dulaney then starts tickling sharon michael helps him
sharon roars with laughter and falls to the floor
the three of them roll around laughing hysterically
sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee
dulaney sits across from him
andrew marsh was a very wealthy man
a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spot light
weve already got press arriving from over the country and she hasnt even been charged yet
cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten
id like you to go with her
im supposed to be on vacation
i know but she wants you to represent her if cardenas files
because i told her you were the best criminal attorney we have
raymond im the only criminal attorney you have
jokingly well i guess that makes you the best
candidly look frank she stands to inherit three million dollars
as executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us
all im asking you to do is talk to her
dulaney thinks about it for a moment
alright ill talk to her shes waiting in the conference room
dulaney stands and walks towards the door
continuing you know i knew andrew marsh for almost twenty years or thought i did
what do you think would make a man in his condition do the things he did
dulaney stops at the door and looks back
i think the question is what is it about her that made him want to do it
rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a cigarette
sunlight flows through a window and highlights her hair
she is dressed in a fashionable business suit that clings to every curve of her body
dulaney enters the room
when he sees her he cant help but stare
rebecca notes his gaze
miss lawson im frank dulaney
she raises the cigarette to her lips
dulaney notices despite her outward composure her hand is shaking
nervously are you going to represent me
there are no charges against you
im here to decide if im going to represent you should that occur
beat did you kill him
rebecca appears hurt by the question
you dont waste any time do you
dulaney doesnt answer
he studies her his eyes probing hers
continuing do you think i did it
i dont know
thats why im asking you
you must have some feeling
some immediate impression
a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will
and the things that went on in that house
such wild sex
what kind of picture does that paint
not a very good one im afraid
and thats exactly what the jury will see when they look at me
thats why i need a very good lawyer mr
youre assuming the district attorney is going to file charges
rebeccas anxiety begins to surface
she feigns a weak smile
hes an ambitious man
ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others
you still havent answered my question
she takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering
she looks at dulaney
displaying emotions is not something that comes easily
tears well up in her eyes
emotionally i loved him
a big part of my life has been torn away from me mr
a part i can never get back and on top of that people are saying that i am somehow responsible for it
theyve taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and made it dirty
a single tear streams down her check
she knows what he wants to hear her say and she resents having to say it
no i didnt kill him
cardenas walks down the hall sipping a cup of coffee
troxell walks towards him excitedly
they walk together
i think im going to make your day
troxell points to an office
through the glass partition we can see a man sitting at a table
alan paley is a well groomed man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good
ive got this guy in my office
doctor alan paley
wait until you hear what he has to say
cardenas and troxell enters the room
cardenas shakes hands with paley and listens with great interest as he starts to talk
dulaney and sharon are in bed
dulaney reads some papers
sharon finishes reading her magazine
she puts it on the nightstand and looks at dulaney
how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults
he must have something or he wouldnt be pressing so hard
if he files are you going to take the case
i dont know yet
i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow
whats she like
charming when she wants to be
dulaneys description seems to bother her
she sounds like quite a woman
joking yeah but can she cook
sharon hits him on the arm playfully
the whole thing gives me the creeps
i mean what if she really humped him to death
dulaney grins at her choice of words
humped grinning yes
i can think of worse ways to go dulaney rolls over gathering her up in his arms
continuing and speaking of humping
he reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the lights
as dulaney and rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by a crowd of reporters
dulaney puts his arm around rebecca and ushers her through the crowd
dulaney and rebecca sit on one side of a table
cardenas sits at his desk
i didnt know that andrew was dead until mr
sattler called me at home that night
we have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty
shes not denying she was there
did you have sex
what time did you leave
six thirty and he was very much alive
miss lawson do you use cocaine
did you use it the night marsh died
i havent done it in years
did marsh use it
it had to get there somehow
it didnt get there from me
were you aware of mr
marshs heart condition
marshs cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied mr
marsh to their office on at least two occasions
thats correct but andrew never told me he had a heart condition
he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious
he never mentioned his heart disease
she just said that
why do you think he lied to you
thats something only marsh would know
i think miss lawson knew it too
i think she slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high hard one
dulaneys anger shows
my client doesnt have to take this crap from you
sit down frank
miss lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions
she doesnt have to sit here and be insulted
so either you charge her now or were leaving
dulaney and cardenas lock eyes
cardenas shrugs his shoulders
dulaney motions for rebecca to get up
she stands and they walk to the door
reese looks at cardenas
rebecca lawson youre under arrest for the murder of andrew marsh
rebecca is stunned frightened
she looks at dulaney in disbelief
dulaney looks at cardenas angrily
reese removes his handcuffs as he moves towards rebecca
you have the right to remain silent
if you give up to reese i dont think the handcuffs will be necessary
you can finish giving miss lawson her rights outside
reese grabs rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door
she looks back at frank her face filled with fear her eyes welling with tears
ill have you out in a few hours
reese ushers her through the door
dulaney and cardenas are left alone
cardenas starts fishing through a can of nuts carefully extracting the cashews
dulaney continues to stand
lookin to make the papers john
marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will
she admits to being there the night of his death
thats opportunity and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle
continuing you cant show intent
cardenas looks at dulaney wryly
he knows that dulaney is trying to discover his game plan
cardenas looks into his can of nuts and fishes for another cashew
continuing can you
take your pole out of the water frank
the fish aint biting today
john its me remember
ive known you since your name was juan carlos
cardenas doesnt appreciate dulaney mentioning his real name
continuing cmon think about it
if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find
she planned this
she wanted us to find the nasal spray
why would she want that
because shes clever
because she knows that even if we didnt find it wed have suspicions as to why a man in marshs condition would use cocaine
suspicions maybe but suspicions arent enough for a conviction
s report stated that marshs nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use
without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning
we would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her
i dont buy it and neither will a jury
were going all the way on this one frank
tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two fifteen to twenty five
ill tell her but she wont take it
then shes not as smart as i thought she was
youve seen her in the depositions
tell me you dont have any doubts
arent they all
well well let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that
dulaney gets up slowly and leaves
dulaney waits at the counter
a barred door slides open and rebecca is led out by a woman jailer
even in these surroundings she maintains her composure
she walks to the counter and waits silently
as dulaney and rebecca leave they are once again encircled by reporters screaming questions asking them to verify rebeccas arrest
dulaney plows through the crowd with rebecca in tow
gray clouds hang overhead threatening rain
tall birch trees line the river the color of their leaves hinting that autumn is approaching
dulaney and rebecca walk along a jogging path cut along the bank
i want you to know right now that the trials going to be nasty
your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud
theyre going to say that you enticed marsh led him down a dark path
andrew hardly needed leading
he was a very passionate man
he was eager to explore
i gave him what he wanted
we fulfilled each others needs
this is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex
im used to being on the outside looking in
the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk
about weekend trips together
those same men will be sitting on the jury
i am who i am
i cant deny it anymore than you can deny who you are
i like sex different i like it wild
thats not a crime
emotional i loved andrew
we made love together
we made it differently but we still made love
it was our way
it was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice
if i was some middle aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me
she stops walking and stares out over the river
have you ever seen animals make love mr
they have such passion such savage emotion
they struggle and snarl and claw but neither hurts the other
no pain no gain
something like that
were not animals
as rebecca speaks dulaney seems captivated
of course we are
our primal urges are still there but weve taken sex and intellectualized it refined it down to its most essential components
its bland easy mechanical
theres great passion in the struggle such craving in denial
do you know what its like to yearn for something
im not talking about wanting or needing
im talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire
dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words but hes uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside
awkwardly i think were getting a little off the subject here
i thought the subject was sex
as it pertains to you not me
beat did you always know you had different
i dont know if its something i can explain to you
because its beyond intellect
it has to be experienced it cant be imagined
rebecca thinks for a moment
when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard
so did this family down the road
i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries
it wasnt easy
the stone walls were high and id scrape my knees as i climbed over
on the other side were wild rose bushes
the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down
if you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard
because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it
dulaney appears lost in her words
this isnt lost on rebecca
she walks off
dulaney stares after her intrigued
a light rain falls outside
dulaney picks at his food
he stares out the window
he seems oblivious to the conversation between sharon and michael
alberts got the stomach flu
thats too bad
no its not
now i get to pitch
michael you shouldnt be happy when someone else isnt feeling well
not even if theyre a dork
not even if theyre a dork
you should go by and see how hes feeling
jerry milner stopped by and albert puked right in front of him
sharon tries to suppress a grin
dont use language like that at the dinner table
sharon looks at dulaney
he is still staring out the window deep in thought
dulaney is at his desk looking at photographs of marsh and the bedroom
frank i know youre busy but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him
he wanted to know why you werent talking to him
ill talk to him later
why dont you talk to him now
because i go to trial in seven weeks
ive got a lot of preparing to do
angry no ones asking you not to work
i just think you could make some time for your son
michael lies on his bed doing his homework
the door opens and dulaney enters and sits beside him
im sorry if it looks like im not paying attention to you lately
michael looks at dulaney somewhat confused
dulaney tries to explain it another way
continuing you know how it is sometimes when youre out playing ball with your friends
how youre really concentrating on what youre doing and you lose track of time and you come home late and mom yells at you
well thats kind of how i am right now
is mom yelling at you too
yeah a little
dulaney leans over and hugs michael
i love you
i love you too dad
charlie biggs is a tall wiry black man
street wise but basically good humored
he is tossing a nerf ball through a basketball hoop mounted on the wall as dulaney enters
how you doin mister d
you familiar with the marsh case
yeah i hear they had em a real dog and pony show going on up there ill tell you sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me
i mean did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that
it couldve happened to anyone
ghetto accent im sorry man but i aint ever heard of no brother dying from gettin too much pussy
dulaney grins in spite of himself
we have to find out who else would profit from marshs death and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would
so where do we start
i want you to hit all the dealers in town
give them a list of people close to marsh and see if any of them use
then i want you to check out a doctor alan paley
he lives up in roseburg
dulaneys secretarys voice crackles over the intercom
mister dulaney i have rebecca lawson on one
dulaney picks up the phone
on the phone hi
no i dont
one oclock is fine
alright la brasa
dulaney hangs up
biggs is staring at him with a grin
defensive im taking a client to lunch
where should i go taco bell
biggs tosses the ball to dulaney then raises his hands indicating he is backing off
dulaney shoots from his desk
dark wood and leather
dulaney sits at a table with rebecca
she removes a cigarette and holds it waiting for dulaney to light it
dulaney fumbles through his pockets and removes a book of matches
he lights one
rebecca doesnt lean forward to meet him
he must go to her
she looks into his eyes as she cups her hand over his
she lights the cigarette and takes a drag then arches her neck back and blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling
she does not blow out the match or remove her hand from dulaneys
she watches him as it burns down towards his fingers
after a long moment she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his hand
howd you meet marsh
i was at a cocktail party
andrew was in chicago on business
he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling
he looked so helpless
a foursome a few tables away are staring at her
rebecca sees them
we started talking
in fact we talked until four in the morning
we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests
after that we were together all the time until he left
he used to call me every night after he came back
then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him
ive never left
why didnt you live together
andrew was worried about how it would look
a couple in a booth are looking at rebecca and whispering
rebecca and dulaney notice them
can we get out of here
rebecca stands up
she doesnt answer
she just walks off
dulaney pulls up in his car behind rebeccas
they get out
dulaney follows her as she walks to the door
this is your house
walking towards the door i know
i dont think this is a good idea
rebecca stops and turns towards him
because im your attorney
i shouldnt be going to your house
is it against the law
no it just doesnt look right
rebecca stares at him for a moment then looks down the street to her left and back to her right then back at dulaney
no ones looking
she walks to her front door and opens it
she enters leaving the door open
dulaney waits for a moment then follows
rebecca is standing in the middle of the room
her back is to dulaney but she knows he is there
dulaney looks around the room
he stares at a group of photographs on the wall
on the other wall is a giant television screen
filled with erotic paintings and photographs sensual but not vulgar
rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies the artwork
what do you think
i think the photographers probably a voyeur
im the photographer
oh well theyre different
thats not an answer
its not my taste
seductively tastes can change
rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet
sitting on top of the cabinet is a white persian cat
there you are
she stands on her tip toes as she reaches up
dulaney watches her the arch of her back the hem of her skirt rising up her legs
she lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and sits down
the slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs
dulaneys eyes trace along them
rebecca notes his gaze
what are you thinking
dulaney looks up quickly
shall i tell you what you were thinking
you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt
the fact that he doesnt protest confirms that she is right
she runs her finger lightly along her thighs
dulaney walks to the window and stares out
rebecca seems amused
she puts the cat down and walks over to him
i wasnt trying to embarrass you
he slowly turns towards her
yes you were
dulaney stares at her for a moment then places his briefcase on the table and opens it
a fork digs into a large strawberry
pull back as we follow the strawberry into sharons mouth
dulaney sits across from sharon
his eyes are on the strawberries
his mind is someplace else and it isnt hard to guess where
he said it might be too expensive to add another room
he suggested we might convert the garage into a guest room
hes going to check with the contractor and let me know
ill let you know how much and we can decide
dulaney looks up slowly
it is not so much that he has heard the question it is more that he is aware that sharon has stopped talking
sharon isnt sure he has heard her
is that alright frank
ill be right back
he stands and leaves the table
dulaney walks to a pay phone near the bathrooms
he thinks for a moment then dials a number
awkwardly i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow
yes she did
ill see you at the office at nine
no not at the office
ive got a better idea
an old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake
dulaney and rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it
i figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice
looks at the cabin isnt it beautiful
sadly andrew loved this old cabin
fondly remembering he always dreamed about moving to tahiti living in a hut and becoming a beach bum
a sad smile i could never imagine myself doing that but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive so wonderful
soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets leaving the world and its problems behind
i wish hed had a chance to do it
her mind drifts away for a moment locked on some distant memory
snapping out of it sorry
dulaney and rebecca walk along the shore
a soft wind blows through her hair
tell me about doctor paley
i hardly know him
he wanted me and he couldnt have me
its going to be hard to convince a jury that hes testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off
confidently it wont be that hard
she walks off
dulaney and rebecca sit on an old porch swing
did you always want to be a lawyer
no i wanted to be a professional hockey player
that seems so far away from who you are now
i broke my ankle skating
that ended that dream
its hard to let go of a dream isnt it
to let go of what you want
dulaney stares at her she looks beautiful in the warm light of the setting sun
their eyes meet
he starts to lean in towards her then stops
he gets up and walks away
rebeccas car pulls up in front
dulaney gets out
im going to put the car away
you can let yourself in
theres a key under the flower pot
rebecca drives to the rear of the building
dulaney walks to the door
he lifts the flower pot removes a key opens the door and goes inside
detective reese is parked in his car watching the house
he glances at his watch then makes a note in his note pad
rebecca walks over to the stereo and turns on the cassette player
the room fills with soft sexy music
dulaney stands in the middle of the room his eyes following her every move
yes it would be nice
you and me making love
is that what you think i was thinking
no thats what i know you were thinking
before dulaney can start to protest she continues
she slowly walks behind him
dulaney stares straight ahead
how often do you make love to your wife frank
once a week
there once was passion wasnt there
but now its bland predictable
tell me when you do it do you always think of her
or do you wonder what it would be like to be with someone else
someone who would force you to lose control
her words strip his thoughts bare
he is vulnerable
continuing theres nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank
you take a lot for granted
dulaney starts for the door
rebeccas cool exterior fades giving way to her vulnerable side
please stay frank
i dont want to be alone
i dont expect anything from you no demands no complications
i just need to feel close to someone
dulaney turns back towards her
he thinks for a moment then walks back into the room
rebecca smiles warmly invitingly
ill be back in a minute
help yourself to a drink
she disappears down the hall
dulaney stands were he is wondering what he is doing there
he walks over to the bar and pours a scotch
he looks down the hall
the bedroom door is open
the room is dark lit only by the moon
rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head
moonlight washes over her body silhouetting her
she runs her hands lightly over her stomach working her way up to her round full breasts
she stops for a moment and we sense she knows dulaney is watching her
dulaney stares at her mesmerized
he knows he should turn away but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look
one by one rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans revealing her sheer white panties
she bends forward slightly and slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles then steps out of them
we can see the desire on dulaneys face
he looks away
the conflict inside him grows
he looks back
rebecca walks into the hall
she is barefoot wearing a long slinky dress her eyes catch dulaneys
if she wasnt aware he was watching her before she is now
it doesnt seem to bother her
she moves towards him slowly her eyes inviting his
dulaney moves towards her
they meet in the middle of the room
she waits he moves closer so close that he can smell her
she cranes her neck back subtly tempting him to bring his lips to hers
the longing overcomes him
he kisses her lightly the kiss lingers for a moment then she grabs him forcefully by the hair arching his head back
she bites his lip
whispering my way
dulaney ignores her
he tries to kiss her again
she turns her head away
she walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door
he tries the door its locked
he starts to knock stops turns and walks back into the living room
he starts to leave stops
he looks at the bedroom door
his passion builds his hunger for her devours him
he moves quickly down the hall eyes filled with determination
he breaks the door open with his shoulder
rebecca is standing in the center of the room as if waiting for him
he moves to her
she can see the fire in his eyes
he takes her in his arms kisses her neck feverishly feeding his craving for her
he is lost within her now and doesnt hear her
she pulls his hair jerking his head back
her eyes command him to follow her demand
something in him snaps a new door opens
he pushes her back onto the dressing cabinet
he kisses her running his hand up her thighs hiking up her dress
she wraps her legs around his waist
they move along the cabinet knocking jars and bottles to the floor
he lifts her carries her to the bed lays her down and rips her dress from her body
their passion is unleased
they grope and claw for one another hungrily
she pulls his shirt off and bites him on the shoulder
his face tenses from the pain but he moans with pleasure
sharon is asleep
the door opens and dulaney enters quietly
he walks towards the bathroom
dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face
he unbuttons his shirt and takes it off wincing as he does
he turns his back to the mirror
several deep fingernail scrapes are dug into his back
he looks at himself in the mirror
dulaney and biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler
biggs pours himself a glass
before you ask theres nothing new on the coke
youve got to get me something i can use charlie
sattler walks over with another man
he ignores biggs
frank this is harvey willows from the l
hed like to ask you a few questions
its an incredible story going on here
as if quoting a headline woman accused of using sex to kill lover
ill say its gonna give a whole new meaning to the state nickname
biggs laughs and walks off
sattler glares at him
confused whats the state nickname
dryly the beaver state
rows of new town houses line the street
dulaney drives up and walks towards the front door of one of them
joanne braslow answers
she stares at dulaney innocently
high tech furniture and designer lights
joanne sits on the couch dulaney on one of the chairs
there is coffee on the table
i worked for mr
marsh for six years
he was a good man until she came along
look i know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for
long enough and well
joanne stops as emotion fills her
her eyes well with tears
you dont really believe what the district attorney is saying about miss lawson do you
i dont know
its incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be rebecca
i take it you dont like miss lawson very much
i really dont know her that well
we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it
if you dont know her that well what makes you think shes capable of murder
andrew was a kind and gentle man but he was thirty years older than her
wheres the attraction to sleep with someone like that to have the kind of sex they had
how do you know what kind of sex they had
i wasnt lookin through the keyhole if thats what youre thinking
id come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew
id find their little toys all over the place
marsh use drugs
what about miss lawson
dulaney is shocked by this
how do you know that
i was at the house one morning i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr
when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial
dulaney looks like hes been kicked in the stomach
is something wrong
dulaney looks at her slowly
thank you for your time
he gets up and walks to the door
joanne stands and stares after him with a trace of a grin
rebecca opens the front door and dulaney barges into the room
you lied to me
i just left joanne braslow
she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marshs house
yelling thats not good enough goddamit
it isnt true
you have to believe me
no i dont have to believe you
the jury has to believe you and answers like hes lying or shes mistaken arent going to convince them
i dont use cocaine anymore
if she says she saw me doing it shes lying
why would she lie
i dont know frank but dont you think thats something we should find out
dulaney is confused struggling to decide if he believes her
sharon is getting a load of washing ready
she picks up one of dulaneys tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of blood near the shoulder
dulaney enters the room to find michael on the phone
dulaney appears nervous anxious
michael get off the phone
impatiently because im expecting a call
but its sunday
snapping i know what day it is
get off the phone
hurt into phone i gotta go
ill call you later
michael hangs up and leaves the room
dulaney stares at the phone struggling against himself
he picks it up and dials
this is rebecca lawson
im not in right now
so if you please leave a message dulaney slams down the phone
he checks his watch
dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps
sharon is awake staring up at the ceiling
she rolls over and carefully lifts up dulaneys tee shirt
she sees the scratches on his back
she does not wake him
she just lays there deep in thought
rebecca walks down the hall
in the b
we see dulaney walking quickly to join her
i called you all weekend
where were you
i went out on the boat
the gallery is crowded with reporters and spectators
dulaney sits beside rebecca at the defense table
cardenas stands before the jury
dulaney and cardenas are seated at their respective tables
rebecca sits beside dulaney
she is wearing a beautiful well tailored dress
she looks beautiful and has surprisingly made no attempt to down play her looks
judge burnham a confident black man in his fifties sits behind the bench
he is strong willed tough but fair
there is a rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets
this trial by its very nature is explosive
the press is going to have a field day and i will not tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it
to dulaney and cardenas both of you are going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives
i warn you now
when you do so if you cannot establish a clear line of relevancy early on in your examinations i will stop you
is that clear
dulaney and cardenas both nod
cardenas stands and walks towards the jury
points to rebecca you all can see the defendant rebecca lawson
but as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the defendant she is the murder weapon itself
stops and thinks for a moment is that possible
can a person actually be a weapon
the answer is yes
if i hit you and you die i am the cause of your death
but can sex be called a weapon
and what a deadly weapon rebecca lawson made of it
the state will prove that miss lawson seduced andrew marsh that she put increasing sexual demands on him while she secretly administered cocaine
all the while knowing that he had a severe heart condition
beat she is a beautiful woman but when this trial is over you will see her no differently than a gun or a knife or any other instrument used as
she is a killer
and the worst kind one who disguised herself as a loving partner
cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down
dulaney stands up and approaches the jury
i know what youre thinking and its a mistake
you look at miss lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was involved with an older man and you think she looks like the type
she couldve done it
and thats exactly what the district attorney wants you to think
yes she is beautiful
does that make her a killer
of course not
this case is not about appearances
its about facts
beat as mr
cardenas presents his case you will see that there are very few facts that the bulk of the states evidence is circumstantial
im confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just have a reasonable doubt
you will have no doubt at all that rebecca lawson is innocent of the charges against her
mccurdy is on the witness stand
cardenas stands before him
doctor mccurdy what was the cause of death
a massive cardiac arrest
what was mr
marshs physical condition prior to his death
he was suffering from severe arterial disease
was the heart attack the result of natural causes
what induced it
we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood
marsh used cocaine
i dont think so
the membrane in his nasal passage didnt show any sign of long time usage
then how did it get into his body
we found a bottle of dristan nasal spray on the nightstand
it was filled with water and cocaine
marsh had a head cold at the time of his death
i believe he wasnt aware that he was ingesting cocaine
cardenas holds up a bottle of nasal spray in a plastic bag
he brings it over to mccurdy
is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand
examines it yes
your honor the state enters this evidence as exhibit a
to mccurdy were any fingerprints found on the bottle
yes those of mr
marsh and a thumb print of miss lawsons
mccurdy what would cocaine do to someone in mr
increase his heart rate
and if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine
it would be an added stress to his heart
what would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to mr
marsh and then induced him to make love
it would be the same as shooting a gun at him
thank you doctor mccurdy
to dulaney your witness
rebecca looks at dulaney for his opinion of mccurdys testimony
dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he stands up and approaches mccurdy
can you say with any certainty that mr
marsh didnt ingest the cocaine himself
no but it seems highly unlikely that a man in his condition would use cocaine
thats your opinion doctor but im asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually put the cocaine into the dristan bottle
cardenas stands before doctor trammel a thin pasty faced man in his fifties
doctor trammel when did you first diagnose that mr
marsh had heart disease
about a year and half ago
marsh change his lifestyle after that
yes he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly
he did everything he could to take care of his heart
did miss lawson ever accompany mr
marsh to your office
just one last question
what does the sign on your office door say
doctor steven trammel
cardenas walks back to his seat signaling his examination of the witness is over
trammel did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr
marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness
did miss lawson ever accompany mr
marsh inside during his examinations
then you have no way of knowing what mr
marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits
no i dont
joanne braslow is on the stand
she is wearing a smart business suit and large framed glasses
her hair is pulled back tight
cardenas stands before her
how long were you mr marshs personal secretary
did you ever see mr
marsh use cocaine
what about miss lawson
tell the court about that please
i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial
did you see mr
marsh the day before his death
how did he look
he was tired and pale
did you talk about miss lawson
what did mr
he was worried
he said that she was acting stranger and stranger
he said that if this kept up she was going to kill him
that his heart couldnt take it
there is an audible buzz from the crowd
for the first time rebeccas confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern
to dulaney your witness
cardenas sits down
dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards joanne
how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom
what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial
do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom
yes thinks a moment it was on a friday
i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday
it would be october twenty eighth
could you repeat the last part of what mr
marsh said to you the day before his death
he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him
that his heart couldnt take it
marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to chicago for awhile
yes he mentioned it
so the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving
that must cause tremendous anxiety
so isnt it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love
that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didnt stop it was going to kill him
that if she did leave his heart couldnt take it
the jury waits anxiously for her answer
joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks
she appears confused
i dont know
im not sure
well think about it
isnt it possible
i suppose its possible
cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated
rebecca breathes a sigh of relief
quiet and desolate most of the city employees have left for the day
dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with rebecca
you were brilliant today
its only the beginning
strong endings start with strong beginnings
growing excitement i love the way you twist what people say around manipulating their own words against them
they reach rebeccas car
can i see you later
you can see me now
rebecca presses against him raising her knee gently into his groin as she kisses him passionately
dulaney is lost in her kiss for a moment then breaks it off and looks around
rebecca smiles takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of her car
she takes one of the shoes and hits the parking lot overhead light fixture
the bulb breaks sending the area in darkness
what are you doing
she steps down and kisses him again
for a moment he tries to resist
i want you inside me
his desire fills him
he pushes her back onto the hood of her car hiking up her dress with his hands as she reaches down and unbuttons his pants
the room is dimly lit
dulaney is in bed
he appears to be deep in thought
rebecca enters wearing a sheer silk bathrobe and carrying a tea service on a tray
he places it on the bed and sits beside him
paley could be a problem tomorrow
im sure youll be able to handle him
im glad you have such confidence in me
dont worry about paley
he cant touch me
no one can
ive thought it all out
sits up very concerned what does that mean
youve been thinking about the case
or you thought everything out before you killed marsh
the question hurts rebecca it shows on her face
she looks away from him
he feels bad for asking such a question
she doesnt look at him rebecca im sorry
he takes her hand
she slowly looks at him and smiles
she points to the tea service
sugar or honey
she lifts a plastic bottle of honey and starts to pour it into a cup
she stops and smiles seductively at dulaney then parts her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her thigh
she reaches out grabs him by the hair and gently pulls him forward
he kisses her knee and slowly runs his tongue along her thigh following the trail upwards
she arches her back closes her eyes breathes deeply from the pleasure of his touch
the door opens light from the hall streaks into the room
sharon is asleep
dulaney enters quietly
he watches her
he looks over at the nightstand
a photograph of dulaney and sharon on vacation
dulaney is carrying her on a beach
he is wearing a large sombrero
they are both laughing
dulaney looks back at sharon
he is a man lost within himself
he walks to the bathroom
sharon opens her eyes and stares at him
court is in session
the state calls doctor alan paley
doctor paley stands and walks towards the witness stand
paley has been sworn in
cardenas examines him
where did you meet miss lawson
at a dinner party about eight months ago
did you ever see her again after that
yes several times
what eventually happened to your relationship with miss lawson
we stopped seeing each other
well i realized that she wasnt interested in me
she was just trying to get information out of me
what kind of information
she said that she was working on a novel and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone with a bad heart
whispers from the crowd fill the room
did you suggest any
yes insulin and others
what did she say
she said that those werent any good because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned
she wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high
and what did you suggest
more gasps from the crowd
rebeccas remains calm but her eyes glare at paley hatefully
to dulaney your witness
cardenas sits down
dulaney approaches paley with a smile
paley where were you the last time you saw miss lawson
we had dinner at a restaurant
isnt it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot
you didnt grab her and try to kiss her
if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence
paley thinks for a moment
he is nervous
well as i remember it we had an argument
and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not
and after that didnt you continuously harass miss lawson
dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a tape player from a cardboard box
your honor this is a tape from miss lawsons answering machine
i would like to play it now
your honor we dont know where this tape is from
who made it or under what circumstances it was made
dulaney takes out two pieces of paper and approaches the bench
these are reports from two independent audio labs
they each state that the voices were recorded over the phone and that no alterations have been made
judge burnham studies the paper
ill allow it
dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the play button
we hear a beep then
rebecca i know youre there godammit
answer the phone you bitch
you cant treat me like this
we hear a phone slam down
you want to play games with me
who the fuck do you think you are
okay well play
youll be sorry
dulaney stops the machine
he takes a dramatic pause letting the words on the tape sink in
cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration
dulaney approaches paley who is now very nervous
quoting youll be sorry
i was angry
youre still angry arent you
isnt it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson
no she asked me about cocaine
i suggest it never happened
angrily you can suggest anything you want
no further questions
paleys temper explodes
he is a loose cannon
i may have been infatuated with her but i wouldnt perjure myself
thats all dr
rain falls streaking along the bedroom windows
candles light the room
dulaney and rebecca are on the bed
she sits on top of him writhing back and forth lost in the rhythm of their love making
he is asleep laying on his back the sheets pulled up to his waist
lightning flashes outside a clap of thunder follows
he stirs and wakes up
another flash of lightning illuminates rebecca who is standing over him in a sexy silk robe
dulaney starts to sit up but something restrains him
he is handcuffed to the brass head what the
what are you doing
she sits next to him looks at him fondly gently strokes his face with her hand
nervously rebecca take these off
tonight we open new doors
she slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach to his chest
dulaney follows it with his eyes
rebecca picks up a large candle on the nightstand and moves it slowly back and forth over his chest
what are you going you doing
are you scared
he doesnt answer
he doesnt have to
she can see the fear in his eyes
she tilts the candle a stream of wax pours out on his chest
dulaney winces with pain his body arching on the bed his hands straining against his restraints
she smiles a wicked smile then pours more wax making a thin trail of little beads that moves down his chest towards his stomach
dulaneys face cringes
he stares at her through eyes filled with fear
whispering i love you frank
i love your strength be strong for me now
she continues to pour the wax in little beads filling his navel and working her way towards his groin
pleading rebecca please
rebecca stares at him warmly fondly
i told you in the beginning that it was my way
my way can be many things pleasure or pain
she lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn
he tenses as she pours it on his chest
then relaxes when he realizes its water
he breathes a sigh of relief
you see how life is frank
we judge things
we look at things from the outside and assume we know whats on the inside
she takes a sip from the bottle
but you assumed it was vinegar because you were only looking at the outside
her meaning isnt lost on dulaney
she watches him as if studying him then slowly very slowly she pulls on the belt of her robe
the robe parts revealing the beauty of her body
she gently lowers herself on top of him pressing her breasts against him
dulaneys breathing quickens in excitement
rebecca moves her head to his chest kissing his burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach
she gradually moves her head down lower and lower
he stares at the ceiling his mind a maze of confusion
soon the power of her touch fills him overpowering him
his eyes close
the pain that only moments ago filled his body is replaced with pleasure
dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs
a light comes on
sharon is sitting on the couch waiting
her voice startles dulaney
yeah what are you doing up
we have to talk
thats what i was hoping youd tell me
dulaney enters the living room
sharon its late
can we get to the point
where have you been
charlie and i were going over some statements
charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you
beat you were with her werent you
why did you lie to me
because i knew youd think exactly what youre thinking
sharon springs off the couch
this isnt a courtroom
dont try to turn this around on me
youre sleeping with her arent you
its bad enough that you are
its even worse that you can stand here and lie to me
she starts to walks out of the room
dulaney grabs her by the arm
she swings around and slaps him across the face then stares at him angrily her eyes filled with tears
do you think im some kind of idiot
that i dont have fuckin eyes
she walks out of the room leaving dulaney alone with his thoughts
ester crawford is on the stand
she is a black woman in her thirties thin and tired looking although we get the impression she once was pretty
she is dressed in what is obviously her sunday dress
cardenas questions her
crawford you were mr
marshs maid for nine years
did miss lawson and mr
marsh ever argue
like cats and dogs
what did they argue about
you name it they argued about it
marsh tried his best to keep her happy but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her
did they argue the day before he died
well he died on a sunday and i have the weekends off but they were ripping at each other with both barrels friday afternoon
what was the nature of the argument
could you be more specific
she was calling mr
marsh an old man making discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities
she said that she had needs and that if he couldnt fulfill them shed find someone who could
dulaney jots down a note
did you ever see mr
marsh use cocaine
to dulaney your witness
cardenas sits down
dulaney approaches ester with a smile
did you go to college mrs
your honor i fail to see what mrs crawfords educational background has to do with this case
i was just about to make my point your honor
do it quickly mr
reading from note pad discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities
who told you to say that
ester doesnt answer but her eyes drift past dulaney and focus on troxell
dulaney follows her stare
troxell help you with that phrase
troxell and cardenas squirm a little
i heard him say it
then those are not your own words
what else did the district attorneys office tell you to say
objection your honor
the fact that mrs
crawford heard mr
troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesnt mean the incident never happened
to cardenas im just curious to see if mr
troxell reconstructed anything else
your honor please
ill see both of you in my chambers
judge burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his desk
dulaney and cardenas stand before him
dulaney before you cast aspersions on the district attorneys office by suggesting theyve coaxed this witness to say things that arent true you better have more than a hunch
no your honor
maybe you dont know what its like where mrs
crawford comes from but i do
i came from a neighborhood just like hers
this is a whole other world for her
shes a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people
so she puts on her best dress fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible
beat being poor and having pride is not a crime mr
dulaney and before you attempt to impeach another witness testimony in my courtroom your foundations better be based on something other than semantics
dulaney walks down the steps
cardenas joins him
im surprised you can walk after the way burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon
his comment was meant as a friendly jab between old friends
dulaney doesnt see it that way
coldly ive got work to do
hey the bells sounded
its between rounds
i didnt hear it
whats happening to you frank
youre acting like youre on trial here
this has become personal to you
back off john
cardenas studies him for a moment
youre sleeping with her arent you
dulaney forces a laugh
its not a very convincing one
im talking to you as a friend now
dont ruin your life your career for her
shell spit you out when this is over
you dont know what youre talking about
what does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three oclock in the morning
youve been following me
its an obvious move
im building a case against her remember
something in dulaney snaps
he grabs cardenas and pushes him up against the wall
cardenas pushes back
if your head wasnt up your ass you would have thought of it too
youre losing perspective
get out while you can before she takes you down with her
dulaney walks towards his office
biggs walks quickly down the hall and joins him
ive been waiting for you to get back
you got something on the coke
no but i got something
biggs steps into dulaneys office
biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the couch
dulaney sits at his desk
during lunch i was watching some of marshs home videos
biggs clicks the control
on the tv we see rebecca on top of marsh in the bedroom
he was really into recording this stuff
s office found a box full of tapes
watching rebecca with marsh bothers dulaney
this girl has really got some moves huh
dulaney stands up and turns off the television
if you want to get your kicks go to a video store and rent a porno movie
biggs studies dulaney for a moment
dulaneys reaction bothers him
he turns the tv back on and fast forwards the tape
the screen turns to snow where the tape has been recorded over
this tape was recorded over an existing recording
biggs raises a hand signaling patience
snow still fills the tv screen
i would have missed it but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked
it looks like blank tape but it isnt
its been erased without any input signal coming in
so what good is it to us if its been erased
its very good because when the d
as office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape otherwise they would have buried it
because it hasnt all been erased
biggs looks at the screen
the snow dissolves and a picture fades in
the picture lasts only about five seconds
we see rebecca from the back as she straddles marsh grinding up and down on the bed her hair flowing down her back
marsh raises his hand
his wrist is in a cast
she turns her head to the side and as she does we see that it is not rebecca but joanne braslow
the tape clicks off
dulaney stares at the blank screen
quoting joanne wheres the attraction to sleep with someone like that
joanne braslow walks to her bmw i
she is about to open the door when dulaney approaches her
i need to speak with you
i dont think we have anything more to talk about mr
she starts to get in the car
you were sleeping with marsh
she stops appears shocked that he knows this
there is now a different quality to her an edge
who told you that
he video taped you
i thought he was a kind gentle man
joanne doesnt appreciate dulaney throwing her words back in her face
yes i slept with him but that was a long time ago
marsh was wearing a cast on the tape
it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson
he dumped you for her didnt he
joanne cant hold back the emotion that is building
it must have been horrible
having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you
i was jealous
of course i was hurt
he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with
but i didnt kill him
dulaney studies her
continuing im a practical woman mr
killing andrew wasnt in my best interest
as it is im out of a job and im not in his will
money isnt the only reason people commit murder miss braslow
dulaney walks off
joanne stares after him
her face is cold showing no sign of emotion
dulaney sits beside rebecca but he seems distant
cardenas stands up
the state calls jeffery roston
as soon as she hears the name rebeccas face becomes tense nervous
dulaney notices it
he checks a list
your honor i dont see a mr
roston listed as a prosecution witness
the states investigation just uncovered mr
roston yesterday afternoon in chicago
judge burnham motions for dulaney and cardenas to approach the bench
your honor mr
roston is an ex lover of miss lawsons
why didnt the states investigation uncover mr
he was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago
alright im going to allow his testimony
but your honor thats it mr
take a seat
dulaney walks back to his chair
rebecca appears genuinely nervous
cardenas stands before roston a handsome man with salt and pepper hair in his late fifties
roston what was your relationship with miss lawson
we were lovers
how long were you together
for about one year
how would you describe your sex life with miss lawson
i know this is a very personal subject but could you be a little more specific
it was wild
she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up kinky things
i tried to satisfy her the best i could but it was difficult in my condition
what kind of condition are you referring to
i had a bad heart
there is an audible gasp from the crowd
cardenas waits giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of rostons last statement
dulaney looks at rebecca dumbfounded
he tries to control his surprise from the eyes of the jury but he cant
he stares ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the testimony
what happened next
i had bypass surgery
and how are you now
the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man
how did your relationship with miss lawson progress after the surgery
she left me
dulaney slowly turns and looks at rebecca
the anger and his sense of betrayal show on his face
why did she say she was leaving
she just left
why do you think she left you
well i think that after the operation she realized that
it takes dulaney a few seconds to object to the question
he is clearly preoccupied with the implications of rostons testimony
the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness
your honor mr
roston lived with the defendant for many months
i feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the miss lawson
the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view
did miss lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving
the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation
cardenas i suggest you move on to another line of questioning
when you say your sexual relations with miss lawson were intense what exactly do you mean
it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could
she called it opening new doors
can you give the court an example
it was like sex was a game to her
she got off on the control
she always used to tell me it had to be her way
this strikes a chord with dulaney
continuing its hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is
what would she do that made it hard to resist
shes a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality
sometimes i felt she could read my mind
it was uncanny how she knew exactly what i wanted
a few nights before my heart surgery rebecca woke me
she had handcuffed me to the bed
there are a few snickers from the crowd
dulaney is thinking about the familiarity of rostons testimony
judge burnham bangs his gavel
the crowd becomes silent
she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors
i asked her to stop to take off the handcuffs but she wouldnt listen
what did she say
roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of his life
roston i know this is difficult for you but its important you tell the court what she did
she said she was going to fuck me like ive never been fucked before
more noise from the crowd
judge burnham is annoyed
he bangs his gavel again
due to the sensitive nature of this witness testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to complete it i am clearing the courtroom
sounds of protest fill the room as the bailiffs start to usher out the crowd
the gallery is empty
only dulaney rebecca cardenas troxell roston judge burnham the jury and court officials remain
what did she do next mr
she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me
she reached down and put me inside her
my doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really dont think of those things at a moment like that
you just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her
how deeply you want to please her
beat at first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built
every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop
eventually i started to have trouble breathing
rebecca just kept going faster and faster
no matter what i said she wouldnt stop
i really thought for a moment i was going to die
if you knew it was bad for you why did you do it
i couldnt help myself
you get lost inside a women like her
it was like a drug
it was the best sex i ever had
what happened after that
i woke up the next morning and she was gone
did you change your will while you were with miss lawson
who was your primary beneficiary
the state rests
dulaney is stunned deep in thought
he doesnt appear to hear the question
dulaney looks at the jury
what he sees isnt good
he thinks for a moment
he leans over and quickly speaks with rebecca
we cannot hear them but their conversation is heated
rebecca says something
dulaney looks at roston
roston you said it was the best sex you ever had
is that the best sex with a woman or a man
cardenas bolts from his seat
ill rephrase the question
roston isnt it true you are bisexual
rostons sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial
your honor im trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was
judge burnham thinks for a moment
the witness will answer the question
and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson
and didnt miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover
and she left shortly after that
roston thinks struggling to make a decision
we worked things out
it was three weeks later when i told her about the heart surgery that she left
roston looks around the court room
he is embarrassed filled with emotion
would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her
very upset yes
no further questions
roston looks at the jury their disapproving stares
he is on the verge of tears
rebecca opens the door
a tired looking dulaney enters
they walk to the couch together in silence
rebecca lifts a bottle of champagne out of an ice bucket
whats that for
to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today
rebecca we shattered a mans life in open court
suddenly ice cold fuck him
he tried to shatter mine
he was only doing what he thought was right
youre too weak frank
when you want something you have to do what ever it takes to get it
if something gets in your way you remove it
dulaney stares at her
the person he sees has no feelings no empathy for anyone
you killed him didnt you
i knew you were thinking that
i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom
youre wrong frank
i need you to believe that
you dont need anybody
i do need you
no matter what you think of me i didnt do it
beat i could see the looks on the jurors faces
to the men i represent what they can never have
im a cold heartless bitch and this is their chance for pay back for every woman thats ever blown them off in a bar
to the old women im a vulgar whore and to the young ones i remind them of what theyll never be
it doesnt matter to them that im innocent
theyve already convicted me
im dropping the case
matter of factly no youre not
rebecca picks up a remote control from the coffee table and pushes a button
a tape of dulaney making love to rebecca fills the screen
it is wild passionate
he is dumbfounded as he watches
the implications of what this tape could do to him run through his mind
something in dulaney snaps
he grabs rebecca
they struggle falling down onto the coffee table
the champagne bottle crashes to the floor
rebecca rolls off the table to the floor
she sits up and moves away from dulaney by pushing herself backwards
dulaney lunges at her
his hand grabbing her ankle
rebecca kicks breaks free stands up
dulaney gets to his feet runs after her
he grabs her by the throat and smashes her into the wall
he slaps her across the face
a thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth
it gets easier doesnt it
once you open the door it never closes
dulaney realizes what he is doing
he stares at her in horror then walks towards the door
goes back to the vhs machine
he pushes the eject button on the vcr removes the tape and destroys it
ive got another copy
how do you think your wife would feel if she saw this not to mention your colleagues
dulaneys temper is near the breaking point again he strains to control himself
you can think whatever you want frank but i didnt kill andrew and im not going to prison for something i didnt do
youre a monster
no im a survivor
dulaney sharon and michael sit at the table eating dinner
there is a tense silence
although michael does not know what is going on he can sense the tension
the doorbell rings
ill get it
dulaney answers the front door and biggs rushes in excited
im sorry to barge in but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news
you got something on the coke
i talked to one of the dealers i put the word out to
hes been following the trial pretty closely
he said at one time he wanted to be a lawyer before he became a dealer
charlie are you going to make a point soon
guess whos been buying coke from him for the last five and half years
dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesnt have a clue
marshs secretary joanne braslow
confusion fills dulaneys face
court is in session
rebecca looks around the courtroom trying to get a feel of the crowds opinion
dulaney is not there
she looks at the door anxiously
the rooms waits
dulaney enters sits beside rebecca but acts as if she isnt there
dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an oriental man in his thirties
wong what type of medicine do you practice
and is miss lawson a patient of yours
ive been seeing her for over a year
why does she come to you
she suffers from severe menstrual cramps
did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps
what did you prescribe for her
chinese peony root
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like
its a white powder that comes in a vial
there is a moan from the crowd
cardenas looks at troxell
how do you instruct your patients to take it
i tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water
a previous witness stated that she saw miss lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on october twenty eighth
according to your records when did you prescribe the drug
wong checks his records
october twenty seventh
one last question doctor
if someone didnt know better would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine
yes quite easy
to cardenas your witness
cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this witness
you may call your next witness
the defense calls miss margaret sellers
cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her mid twenties approach the stand
miss sellers appears a little nervous
dulaney smiles warmly
miss sellers do you know dr
where did you meet him
im a nurse
i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital
paleys on staff there
what was the nature of your relationship with dr
we dated for about a month last year
then what happened
i realized he wasnt serious
he was seeing other women asking other nurses at the hospital out so i ended it
and what did dr
paley do after you stopped seeing him
he used to call me tell me that i couldnt just walk out on him
he said that if i didnt come back hed make my life miserable
did he make your life miserable
yes he did
cardenas stands again
may i remind mr
dulaney that the person on trial here is miss lawson not dr
your honor im trying to establish a pattern in dr
paleys behavior with women
the witness will answer the question
hed call me in the middle of the night
show up at my house and bang on the door
finally after two weeks i went to his office one day to tell him to stop
what did he say
he laughed and basically said he would decide when it was over
do you remember his exact words
he said if you want to play games well play and youll be sorry
another buzz from the crowd
cardenas inwardly cringes
what happened next
while i was seeing dr
paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary
three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs
there was an inquiry
it was his word against mine
they believed him
i was fired
dulaney is at his desk
biggs enters excited
joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting
i followed her today to an attorneys office
i know him
hes an estate attorney and hes very expensive
what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney
she wasnt even mentioned in marshs will
dulaney thinks for a moment
he grins as an idea enters his mind
not this will
dulaney and biggs sit at a table going through a stack of papers
dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper
here it is
according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
what good does that do its the old will
under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing
since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to
have the old will reinstated
she kills the old man and makes it look like miss lawson did it
dulaney is washing up for dinner
he speaks to sharon who is in the bedroom
i was thinking that when the trial is over wed all go skiing for a weekend
maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael
sharon leaves the room
dulaney reaches for his toothbrush picks up a tube of tooth paste
it is empty
he stares at the to himself drug store
dulaney looks worn tired the tension between him and rebecca shows
dulaney are you ready to call your next witness
dulaney doesnt seem to hear him
dulaney are you with us
dulaney snaps out of it
yes your honor
the defense recalls joanne braslow
as joanne walks towards the stand dulaney looks over at rebecca
its as if he is trying to make up his mind about her
joanne takes her seat
miss braslow id like to remind you that you are still under oath
how often do you use cocaine
cardenas shoots out of his seat
objection your honor
impatiently counsel approach the bench
dulaney and cardenas walk over to the bench
dulaney im getting tired of seeing you this close to me
judge burnham looks at cardenas indicating he will hear his argument now
whether or not miss braslow uses drugs is not an issue here
your honor the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons mr
how it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance
are you able to back up this allegation or are you fishing
i can back it up
to joanne please answer the question
ive tried it
youve tried it
isnt it true that youve been in and out of rehab centers for the last four years
this is clearly embarrassing for her
ive been to a few yes
you dont like miss lawson much do you
you dont like her because you were involved with mr
marsh before she came along
isnt that true
you resented the fact that she told you what to do in mr
dulaney moves the questions along quickening their pace building a rhythm
and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you
breaking down yes
and that mr
marsh paid less attention to you
and that he changed his will
she has blurted out the answer before the full implications of the question has dawned on her
her face reveals her mistake
cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat
in his previous will mr
marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars then he cut you out
why do you think he did that
she talked him into it
she wanted everything
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money
that must have made you pretty angry
dulaney picks up a small piece of paper and walks towards joanne
you testified that you returned to mr
marshs house at eleven oclock the night of his murder
is that correct
well im a little confused
holds up the paper this is a charge receipt from rosens drug store where mr
marsh had an account
its dated the day of the murder
hands it to her is this your signature
nervously studies it yes
theres an item you picked up thats marked
will you read it
dristan nasal spray
would you read for us the time of the purchase
m or p
you see thats what bothers me
no other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house
the police looked
there was only the one bottle
but you say you didnt arrive until after mr
marsh was dead yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death
how do you think it got there
i dont know
isnt it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought
isnt it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle
why would i want to kill him
because you were jealous
because he cut you out of the will
because you have a cocaine habit to feed because you know that if rebecca lawson is found guilty the new will is void and theres a very good chance the
old one would be honored
silence fills the room
members of the jury look at rebecca they are confused doubt fills their minds
the defense rests
dulaney is standing by the window watching the rain fall outside
we cant go on like this frank
dulaney continues to stare out the window
talk to me
he shakes his no
please this is ripping us apart
emotionally i cant talk about it now
she senses his pain and moves to him wrapping her arms around his shoulders
dont shut me out
let me in
he turns and faces her
she can see the pain on his face
you wouldnt like what youd see
you dont know me anymore
i dont know me anymore
we cant pretend this isnt happening
please not now
why didnt you come to me
i dont know
you used to like to touch me to make love to me
its more involved than that
it was a place to start
you think thats the answer
is that what you want
you want me to make love to you
i dont want our lives ruined because of this
i love you frank
i want this to work but you have to help me
you have to come back from where ever it is you are
dulaneys confusion and emotion begins to surface
she kisses him softly gently
dulaney closes his eyes
he kisses her harder and harder
his passion builds his anger grows
he runs his arm over his desk brushing everything to the floor
he grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk
he kisses her forcefully his lips pressed hard against hers
she struggles against him
his hands tear at her blouse
it is rough angry sex and it frightens sharon
screaming frank stop it
is this what you want huh
she is crying now struggling futilely against him
let me go
godammit frank let go
racked with fear daddy stop it
dulaney stops and looks
michael is standing in the doorway his face filled with fear and incomprehension
tears streak down his face
dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him
his face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total effect of his behavior
softly oh jesus
filled with pain and embarrassment dulaney runs from the room
rain falls in sheets
dulaney sits inside the small structure huddled against one of the pillars
he is a tragic figure desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once knew
rain continues to fall
dulaney is standing across the street staring at the house
he crosses over and is half way to the door when he stops
he starts to leave
the front door opens and sharon steps out onto the porch
he turns around slowly
he cant bring himself to look at her
she walks out into the rain
he lifts his head
tears flow down his face and he cries
when she begins to cry with him he breaks down
ashamed im sorry
god im so sorry
he slowly drops to his knees holding on to her as if she were a strong tree in a wind storm
please help me
dulaney sits beside rebecca
there is tension between them
he does not look at her
dulaney stands and walks over to the jury
the prosecutions case is built on theory speculation
could rebecca lawson have done this
is it possible that she did that
where are the facts
the state has presented two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary
hardly what i would call impartial witnesses
where is one shred of conclusive irrefutable evidence
i dont see it and i dont think you do either
do you know why
because there isnt any
beat whats the issue here
that rebecca lawson likes wild sex
but the district attorney is trying to make you think if rebecca lawson could stray from the path of normal accepted sexual behavior then she could be capable of murder
did she force andrew marsh to make love to her
did she hold a gun to his head
andrew marsh wanted her and why wouldnt he
shes beautiful alluring the type of woman men dream about
as dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing arguments to himself
its human nature
we want what we want when we want it
we dont think about the consequences of our actions
when desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us
we live for the moment
beat here was an exciting young woman who unlocked doors
doors that led into a new world
a world he entered willingly eagerly
he wanted to please her and so he did not tell her of his illness
i know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting something so badly that you are willing to risk everything but thats what passion does to you
its a fire uncontrollable
it consumes you and the only thing you can do is let it burn
andrew marsh let it burn
it was his life his choice and maybe his mistake but making love is not a crime
beat we all have fires inside us secret desires
we guard them hold them in the cages that weve built
when someone comes along and opens the gate they rush out and feed blindly on their pleasure
rebecca lawson loved andrew marsh
she didnt kill him if anything did it was his own passion
dulaney walks back to his table and sits down
rebecca looks at him warmly
dulaney does not look at her
cardenas stands to address the jury
its true we all have fires burning inside us
rebecca lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside andrew marsh and she stoked those flames fanning them until they burned so hot that reason and judgement left him
is making love a crime
of course not but the question isnt as simple as that
rebecca lawson used her seductive qualities to entice andrew marsh
she used sex as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus
the combination of the two provided the conclusion of a premeditated act
beat she asked dr
paley about cocaine
her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that contained the cocaine and she was the sole beneficiary of andrew marshs will
she planned it from beginning to end
she knew about his heart
she secretly administered cocaine then used wild and physically demanding sex to induce a heart attack
beat making love is an act of passion between two people to affirm their vows of love
this was not an act of love this was an act of greed
this was betrayal
rebecca lawson killed andrew marsh and im counting on you to punish her for that crime
dulaney sits on one side of the room rebecca on the other
the room is quiet tense
a man enters and nods to him
to man theyre back already
its only been three hours
dulaney sits beside rebecca
in the row behind them is sattler and biggs
the jury enters
their faces betray nothing
one by one they file into their seats
cardenas sits with troxell both of them watching anxiously
ladies and gentlemen of the jury have you reached a verdict
the jury foreman stands
we have your honor
the bailiff walks over and takes the verdict slip from the foreman then walks over to judge burnham and hands it to him
judge burnham reads the decision
he hands it back to the bailiff who takes it to the court clerk
she waits nervously for the court clerk to read the verdict
he taps his pen against the desk anxiously
he opens the verdict slip and looks at it
he stands slowly
the jury finds the defendant not guilty
relief floods rebeccas face
dulaney shows no emotion
sattler and biggs shakes hands then lean forward to congratulate dulaney
rebecca turns to dulaney to hug him before she can dulaney has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom
dulaney walks towards his car with biggs
there is no sense of victory or elation
what are you gonna do now
take some time off
you think the d
s gonna file on joanne
i dont know
dulaney reaches his car
you did a good job charlie
thanks mister d
biggs walks away
dulaney takes out his keys opens the door to his car
he is about to get in when he senses someone behind him
he turns around
joanne steps out from behind a pillar
she stares at dulaney hatefully
her hand is inside her purse
that bastard should have left me something
i worked for him for six years and he goes and gives it all to her
dulaney looks around the parking lot
he is alone
joanne is obviously very high on something
her mind seems to wander her eyes drift
you take what people say and make it ugly
you make others believe what you want them to
she should have been found guilty
she shouldnt have gotten off
then you would have gotten your money
you killed him didnt you joanne
do you think if i did id be stupid enough to tell you
dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse
what do you have in your purse
what do you think ive got
maybe im gonna kill you too
maybe ill blow your head off right now
her hand starts to come out of the purse
suddenly biggs appears rushing her from behind a pillar
he grabs her hand and pushes her against a car
he pulls her hand from the purse
she is holding a piece of paper
crying im gonna go to jail
i know theyre gonna make it look like i did it
they gotta put it on someone
whyd you come here
holds up the letter to show you this
its a letter from that lawyer koehler
he wrote it to me the day after i saw him
hes the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail
you didnt know about it before that
dulaney is suddenly very confused
then why did you go see mr
koehler in the first place
because he called me
dulaney is stunned
he looks at biggs with a knowing stare
it is raining lightly
dulaney waits at the door of a nice two story home
it is answered by a heavy set man in his fifties hi joe
frank what are you doing here
i need to ask you a question
what made you get in touch with joanne braslow
you know i cant talk about that
im not asking for names or specifics
i just want to know what prompted you to make the call
koehler starts to close the door dulaney sticks his foot inside blocking it
his face is filled with determination
koehler sees it
please i need your help
koehler thinks for a moment
he can sense dulaneys need
all i can tell you is i was contacted by an interested party on miss braslows behalf
dulaney stares through the windshield straining to see the road through the heavy rain
his car phone rings
frank its rebecca
i need to see you right away
ive got the tape
a calmness spreads over his face
ill be right there
lightning fills the sky
dulaney drives up finds a parking spot down the street gets out of his car and runs to the door
as he knocks as loud clap on thunder booms overhead
dulaney waits impatiently
he lifts the flower pot removes the key and opens the door
the dim glow of a desk lamp is the only source of light
dulaney moves through the room slowly
two champagne bottles are on the floor by the couch
dulaney looks on the coffee table
a vial is open and on its side
a razor blade and straw lay next to it
a pile of white powder has been dumped out
several lines of cocaine have been drawn
dulaney starts to move towards the living room
he is almost at the door when the big screen television turns on
we see the tape of dulaney and rebecca making love
is this what youre looking for frank
dulaney turns around to find rebecca standing behind him a remote control in her hand
distant you killed him
you killed him and i got you off
joanne braslow was perfect wasnt she
you knew wed see her on the tape and find out about her coke problem
after that the digging should have been easy but we missed the will
you knew we were following her so you called koehler and had him contact her
that put us right back on track
all we needed then was to prove that she had an opportunity
the drug store took care of that
she dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him
she shrugs her shoulders
his frustration clearly amuses her
she grins slightly almost taunting him
i want the tape
dulaney starts into the living room
ive been thinking about that
ive decided to give it to you after ive collected the inheritance
you can take that one if you want but theres another copy
that wasnt the deal
provoking him so sue me
as cold as ice things have changed
i think you should go home and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again
growing angrier im not leaving without that tape
dont push me frank
i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite
dulaney loses control
you fuckin bitch
he grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall
rebecca struggles but it is little use he is a man consumed with rage
dulaney continues to smash her into the wall
rebecca reaches onto the desk lifts up a fountain pen and stabs it into dulaneys shoulder at the base of his neck
dulaney screams and lets go
rebecca starts to runs into the living room
dulaney catches rebecca grabs her spins her around then backhands her across the face knocking her to the ground
in the b
the video of them in bed plays on the screen
dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair
he repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor
let her go
he looks behind him
standing in the bedroom doorway is dr
he is holding a gun at dulaney
dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his feet his hand holding the wound on his shoulder
a short breathless laugh drifts out of dulaney as he starts to put it all together
rebecca stands up holding her head as she tries to catch her breath
to rebecca are you alright
her face hardens
youve got to kill him alan
shes right paley
youve got to kill me
she doesnt have to shes free she cant be tried again but you you planned it with her
you supplied the coke
youre an accessory to murder
paley struggles to make a decision
the gun shakes in his hand
suddenly the whole scheme becomes clear to dulaney
dont you see what shes doing
she needs you to kill me
shes planned it that way from the start
thats why she phoned me tonight
you called him
no hes lying
hows it supposed to work rebecca
you and paley celebrate your victory
you get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you but then hes given himself away as your accomplice now he has
to kill me
to paley after that i figure shell tell the police that you broke in
that you were crazed because we humiliated you in court
dont listen to him
cant you see hes trying to turn you against me
continuing to paley heres the good part
the truth dies with me and she turns states evidence against you
it wont matter what you say
no one will believe your version youve already discredited yourself in court
youll go away forever and shell have the money all for herself
shes played us both perfectly
paley is becoming more and more confused
dulaney moves towards him
paley lowers the gun slightly
alan listen to me
if you dont kill him its over
everything we did will be for nothing
shut up rebecca
shes good isnt she
but maybe with you its the real thing
points to the screen im sure all those nights she was fuckin me she was thinking of you
confusion crowds paleys mind
im sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked
i mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to im sure she didnt enjoy it
softly i love you alan
you have to believe i love you
kill him and we can be together forever
thats right she loves you
just like she loved roston and marsh and me
dont be a fool
youre nothing to her
the second you pull that trigger shell turn on you
betrayal fills paleys face
his eyes fill with tears
to rebecca i loved you
tense alan dont let him do this
youre everything to me
she moves closer give me the gun
give me the gun and ill do it for you
paley stares at her his mind races
pain fills his face as he fights to make a decision
suddenly his face tenses
he starts to raise the gun at dulaney then just as suddenly he turns it on rebecca and fires
the bullet hits rebecca in the chest
the force blows her off her feet
paley stares at her blankly
he slowly lowers the gun and drops it to the floor then staggers over to rebecca
she stares up through glazed dead eyes
paley takes her pulse
he breaks down weeping over her body his tears signaling to dulaney that she is dead
police cars are lined up outside their red lights flashing
members of the police force along with forensic people go over the area
dulaney sits on the couch
he looks indifferent as if all emotion has been sucked out of him
troxell is beside him taking notes
dulaney looks up
a bodybag on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room
dulaney follows it with his eyes
cardenas enters from the bedroom
they lock eyes
paleys confessed to the whole thing
its like hes got no will to live now that shes gone
thinks for a moment she almost got away with it
do you believe in karma frank
dulaney doesnt answer
well call it what you want
we usually get what we deserve in the end
dulaney looks at him wearily
can i go
to troxell you get his statement
then you can go
dulaney gets up and starts for the door
cardenas watches him
dulaney turns around slowly
cardenas reaches into his raincoat pocket and take out a vhs tape
i found this video in her room
it has your name on it
the two men lock eyes
there is a long silence between them
dulaney waits for cardenas next move
holding it out i assume its yours
dulaney knows that cardenas has seen it
a hint of a grateful smile shows on his face
he takes the tape
a light rain falls
dulaney walks out and heads towards the street
he stops looks back at the condo then walks down the street towards his car
